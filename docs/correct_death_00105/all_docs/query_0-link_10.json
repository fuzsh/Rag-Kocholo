Firstly, I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to the late president of Kokugakuin University, Dr. Abe Yoshiya, who sadly passed away on 1st December 2003. Dr. Abe encouraged me to conduct my PhD research at the School of Oriental and African Studies and, without his support, this book would not have been started. I am extremely grateful to my professors, lecturers and advisors, Dr. Brian Bocking, Dr. Stephen Dodd, Dr. Angus Lockyer and Dr. John Breen. Their advice and expertise have been hugely valuable to me in my studies at SOAS, and will continue to be so in my future endeavours. I would like to extend a special thanks to my personal supervisor, Dr. John Breen. Without his guidance and dedication, this book would never have been finished. In addition, I would like to acknowledge the assistance of Dr. Hirakawa Sukehiro, emeritus professor of Tokyo University, Professor Shimazono Susumu, Department of Religious Studies at Tokyo University, and Dr. Ogawa Masahito, Hokkaido Ainu Culture Research Centre. The suggestions and insights of these scholars, made to me in both formal and informal settings, were invaluable in enabling me to refine the arguments in my research. I would also like to express my appreciation to Neil Raven and Simon Breen, both of whom helped polish my English writing. Without their friendship and commitment, this book would have been far less readable. Nevertheless, if mistakes remain, they are mine and mine alone. Finally, my studies at SOAS would not have been possible without the assistance of Meiji shrine. I would like to record my deepest gratitude to the staff at the shrine, in particular Emeritus Chief Priest Toyama Katsushi, Chief Priest Nakajima Seitarō, and the staff of the Meiji Shrine Research Institute. They have provided endless support, advice, and guidance throughout my studies, and I am forever grateful.\n\nList of Figures and Tables Figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\nThe inner precinct today .......................................................................

Haunted places are the only ones people can live in. —Michel de Certeau1\n\n90 years have passed. Structures for the veneration of the deceased emperor and empress, and the 700,000 m2 of forest-land enveloping them, took their place in the Tokyo landscape. The year was 1920. Six years later, Paul Claudel, poet and French ambassador to Japan, reflected on this site in his essay “Meiji”: It is both vestige and support of the spirit. Its name summons the enshrined presence, and so gives life to a memory between that presence and us; a dialogue is formed; a shared knowledge and understanding are born.2\n\nA decade later in 1936 another Frenchman, Jean Cocteau, visited Japan on his round the world voyage. He left these impressions of the very first site he saw in Tokyo. I thought Japan was over-Americanised, but that was too hasty a conclusion. The presence of a deep-rooted Japanese spirit is to be felt here in this place. This is the hall-mark of Japan. France has none. How pitiable the European writer who cannot depict such things!3\n\nThe name of this place to which they refer is Meiji shrine [Fig. 1]. Dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, it is renowned as one of the most popular shrines in all Japan, not least because it plays host to more visitors during the three days of the New Year celebrations than any other site in the country.4 In February 2009, Hillary Clinton arrived in Tokyo on her first overseas tour as Secretary of State in the Obama administration, and visited Meiji shrine. When a reporter asked her\n\n1 Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, trans., Steven Rendall, 108. 2 Paul Claudel, “Meiji,” in L’oiseau Noir dans le Soleil Levant, 118. 3 Yomiuri shinbun (19th May 1936).

The inner precinct today. (Meiji Shrine Archives).\n\nwhy, she responded, “To show respect toward the history and culture of Japan.”5 What then are the lingering “vestiges,” the palpable “spirit” and this respect-commanding “history” that attach to this site less than a hundred years old? This book lends an ear to the harmonies and disharmonies voiced by the many spirits that haunt this place, and attempts to explore the machinations that enable a place—this place—to be articulated in terms of lingering “vestiges,” of “spirit” and of “history.” Meiji shrine was constructed between 1912 and 1920, and became a major state shrine (kanpei taisha). In the final stages of World War II its buildings were almost completely destroyed by U.S. bombing. In 1946 the shrine was recognised and registered as a religious corporation, following a series of GHQ (General Headquarters) reforms, such as the Shinto Directive. From then it took a further 12 years for the shrine to be rebuilt.6\n\n5 Sankei shinbun (18th February 2009). 6 General accounts on Meiji shrine are drawn from: Naimushō, Meiji jingū zōeikyoku, Meiji jingū zōeishi; Meiji jingū hōsankai, ed., Gaienshi, reprinted in Meiji jingū sōsho, vol. 14, Zōei hen, no. 3, ed. Meiji jingū; Meiji jingū gojūnenshi hensan iinkai, ed., Meiji jingū gojūnenshi; Meiji jingū gaien nanajūnenshi hensan iinkai, ed., Meiji jingū gaien nanajūnenshi.\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nThe purpose of this study is to illuminate the production of the shrine as a contested space. The 46-year period from 1912, when movements for the construction of a shrine to memorialize Emperor Meiji began, to 1958, the year in which the shrine facilities were completed in their present form, is taken as the span for this study. Throughout the period under consideration, circumstances surrounding Meiji shrine evolved constantly in line with the changing nature and meaning of ‘Shinto,’ ‘religion’ and ‘shrine.’ My research begins with an understanding that the only unchanging element was the actual physical location of the shrine, its ‘place.’ I examine the mechanisms by which complex fissures appeared and disappeared within the conceptualised space of Meiji shrine, and by which the shrine managed to keep re-shaping itself as one distinctive place. The spatial analysis adopted here challenges the received ‘logic’ that holds a ‘shrine’ to be a ‘Shinto’ institution, and ‘Shinto’ in turn to be a ‘religion.’ In recent studies, the concept and category of ‘religion’ itself has come under scrutiny as a mode of knowledge. For example, McCutcheon in his provocative work Manufacturing Religion, argues against the pervasive assumption that religion is, sui generis, to be seen anywhere in the world at any time in history. For McCutcheon religion is nothing but a scholarly manufacture.7 Masuzawa expands McCutcheon’s argument in her investigation into the discursive formation of ‘world religions.’ According to Masuzawa, ‘world religions’ is a conceptual framework developed in European academia which swiftly became useful in “differentiating, variegating, consolidating and totalizing a large portion of the social, cultural, and political practices observable among the inhabitants of regions elsewhere in the world.”8 Similarly, in the case of the Japanese concept of religion, scholars have made attempts to re-examine the mode of knowledge of what is termed ‘religion,’ and have suggested that there is a need to analyse how the Japanese themselves have dynamically situated within modern Japanese society various discourses on religion, originating in the West.9 Catherine Bell’s insight is apposite here: “That we construct ‘religion’ . . . is not the main problem; that we forget that we have constructed\n\n7 Russell T. McCutcheon, Manufacturing Religion, 26. 8 Masuzawa Tomoko, The Invention of World Religions, 20. 9 Yamaguchi Teruomi, Meiji kokka to shūkyō; Isomae Jun’ichi, Kindai Nihon no shūkyō gensetsu to sono keifu; Timothy Fitzgerald, “Japanese Religion as Ritual Order”; The Ideology of Religious Studies.\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\n[it] in our own image—that is a problem.”10 Bell’s statement prompts a reconsideration of one particular constructed Japanese category, namely that of State Shinto (kokka Shinto). The State Shinto theories of Murakami Shigeyoshi have had an enormous influence on all subsequent understandings of the development and nature of State Shinto.11 Murakami links the state, the people, Shinto, and the emperor-system as follows: State Shinto was a state religion which was created by the modern nation state, and based itself on the emperor-system. State Shinto manipulated the psychology of the Japanese people for over 80 years, from the time of the Meiji restoration to the end of World War II.12\n\nCurrent theories concerning State Shinto may be divided into three main streams.13 First, there are those like Shimazono who share with Murakami an understanding of State Shinto as a total system affecting all aspects of people’s lives, including religion, thought and education.14 A second stream is more sceptical of Murakami, maintaining that State Shinto should be examined in the context of the government’s regulation of shrines, which stated that Shinto was ‘not a religion.’15 The third group of theories suggests that it is neither relevant nor useful to apply the term State Shinto to the pre-war relationship between state and religion.16 Nitta, in particular, rejects the term ‘State Shinto,’ and maintains that it was an “illusion” invented by post-war scholars as a kind of “masking-ideology.”17 Thus, even the existence of State Shinto itself is still being debated.\n\n10 Catherine Bell, “Modernism and Postmodernism in the Study of Religions,” 188. 11 Murakami Shigeyoshi, Kokka Shintō. For Murakami’s influence, see Haga Shōji, Meiji ishin to shūkyō and Shimazono Susumu, “Kokka Shintō to kindai Nihon no shūkyō kōzō.” 12 Murakami S., Kokka Shintō, 1. 13 The distinction made in State Shinto discourse between State Shinto in the broad sense and State Shinto more narrowly defined is well known. E.g., Nitta Hitoshi, “ ‘Kokka Shintō’ kenkyū no seiri”; Shimazono S., “Shintō to kokka Shintō · shiron: Seiritsu e no toi to rekishi teki tenbō.” 14 Shimazono S., “Jūkyūseiki Nihon no shūkyō kōzō no henyō”; “Kokka Shintō to meshianizumu”; “Kokka Shintō · kokutai shisō · tennō sūkei: Kōdō · kōgaku to kindai Nihon no shūkyō jōkyō.” 15 Sakamoto Koremaru, Kokka Shintō keisei katei no kenkyū; “The Structure of State Shinto”; Kinsei · kindai Shintō ronkō. Isomae claims that State Shinto should only be considered as a means for the government to regulate shrines, and should be redefined as one component in the entire system of ideologies which supported the emperor-centred nation-state (Shūkyō gensetsu, 99). 16 Yamaguchi T., “Meiji Kenpōka no jingikan setchi mondai”; Meiji kokka to shūkyō. 17 Nitta H., “Arahito gami” “kokka Shintō” to iu gensō.\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nFollowing Bell’s argument, I contend that it has been forgotten that State Shinto is a created category.18 The failure to acknowledge the genesis of this category has given rise to a number of theoretical issues regarding the existence of State Shinto. For this reason, far from treating religion, Shinto or even State Shinto as predetermined or static, one must be aware of their continual transformation and reinterpretation. Yamaguchi stresses the extent to which the definition of ‘religion’ varied depending on the agent and historical period; if ‘religion’ was interpreted variably by individuals and groups, we may anticipate that other related terms, such as ‘Shinto’ and ‘shrine,’ have also had variable meanings across time and space.19 Some scholars, such as Shimazono, do not take account of these subtleties, tending to ignore or downplay the significance of differences between definitions of morality and religion, for example. Shimazono argues that State Shinto was merely a new phase in the development of Shinto, one which encompassed education, teaching, and mass media.20 However, whether morality and teaching can be viewed as part of the Shinto domain is unclear, and here it will be necessary to consider the various relevant historical and social contexts in which categories of religion, Shinto and State Shinto were formed and transformed. Furthermore, in order to develop our understanding of the religious state of affairs in modern Japan (from the 1868 Meiji Restoration onwards), we must look beyond the dichotomy of the state and the people, or ‘the suppressing’ and ‘the suppressed.’ Some academics, basing their arguments on an examination of shrine regulations and policies, maintain that no ideological manipulation of the public was attempted by the government, but as Isomae points out, studying regulations tells us little about the impact of these rules on society and the common people.21 Yasumaru, describing\n\n18 Bell, “Modernism,” 188. With regard to terminology, Hayashi points out that ‘State Shinto’ is not a historical source-based term; it is rather a term coined by post war historians to reflect their understanding. He insists that “it should be deployed as a second best strategy until someone comes up with an alternative.” Hayashi Makoto, “Kindai bukkyō to kokka Shintō,” 95–96. 19 Yamaguchi T., Meiji kokka to shūkyō, 29–55. See also, Inoue Hiroshi, Nihon no jinja to ‘Shintō.’ 20 Shimazono S., “Messianizumu,” 248. 21 Nitta insists that the idea of the emperor as a living kami, considered to be one of the main ideological bases of State Shinto (e.g. Murakami S., Kokka Shintō), was invented by the Taisho and Showa scholar Katō Genchi. Nitta suggests that, before Katō, the emperor was not regarded as a living kami but merely as a descendant of kami; he then concludes that there was not much ideological manipulation. It is important to note that Nitta’s analysis of the pre-Katō Japanese situation was based on an examination of the ‘state regulated’\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nthe suppressed masses as historically ‘heterodox,’ considers the religious state of pre-war Japan to have consisted of an antagonistic relation between popular belief and the state shrine system. Here, Shimazono’s problematisation of the Orthodoxy/Heterodoxy dichotomy is instructive. He highlights the shortcomings of Yasumaru’s argument and emphasises the need to understand the dynamics of a relationship in which opposing viewpoints are negotiated and appropriated.22 Other research, taking a broader view, has looked at state shrines and state monuments; discussions have focused on issues such as the ‘invention of tradition’ or the top-down manipulation of ideology.23 However, further work needs to be carried out in order to ascertain how these newly invented systems of meaning, as well as a great variety of ideological agents, elaborated and articulated the highly distinctive space of the shrine.24 While the aforementioned academic debates on religion and State Shinto have been dynamic, research on Meiji shrine in particular has remained relatively limited. Several trends are apparent nonetheless in the research that there is. First of all there is the work by Date and Daimaru et al.25 In 1970, Date published an essay entitled “Meiji Jingū no sōken to hatten” (The establishment and development of Meiji shrine). This and subsequent research tends to emphasise the importance of Meiji shrine in the context of Shinto tradition, but historical differences in the understanding of certain key concepts, such as ‘shrine’ and ‘tradition’ remain to be problematised. In another vein, there are multiple studies of Meiji shrine conducted within such specialized fields as architecture and forestry.26 For example, textbooks for elementary schools. See Nitta H., “Arahito gami,” 22–30; 54–61. For Isomae’s argument, see Isomae J., Shūkyō gensetsu, 98. 22 Yasumaru Yoshio, Kindai tenno zō no keisei, 226. Shimazono S., “Jūkyūseiki,” 31. 23 Haga S., Shiseki ron; “Tennō to junkō”; H. D. Harootunian, “Memory, Mourning, and National Morality.” Fujitani’s Splendid Monarchy follows Hobsbawm’s idea of the invention of tradition. Eric J. Hobsbawm, “Introduction: Inventing Tradition.” Hobsbawm’s idea and its problems are below. I have learned much from Takagi’s works on ‘sacred’ space creations in modern Japan, but he overemphasises the top-down manipulation of ideology. Takagi Hiroshi, Kindai tennōsei no bunkashi teki kenkyū; “Kindai shin’en shiron”; “Kinsei no dairi kūkan”; “Kindai ni okeru shinwa teki kodai no sōzō.” 24 Fujita’s observations on State Shinto are suggestive. Fujita Hiromasa, “Kokka Shintō taisei seiritsu ikō no saisei itchi ron,” 356–7. 25 Date Tatsumi, “Meiji Jingū no sōken to hatten.” Daimaru Masami, “Meiji jingū no chinzachi sentei ni tsuite”; “Meiji jingū no mori no sonzaiigi.” 26 For shrine architecture, e.g., Fujioka Hiroyasu, “Meiji jingū no kenchiku,” no. 1; “Meiji jingū no kenchiku,” no. 2. Fujiwara Keiyō, “Meiji jingū sōken ni miru nagare zukuri ishō\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nFujioka and Fujiwara are architectural scholars who have conducted surveys on the structural design and techniques employed in the construction of the shrine buildings. The merit of their research is that it situated Meiji shrine architecture within the broader historical context of modern Japanese architecture. Shinji is one researcher who has explored how the Meiji shrine forest came to be developed, and he has illuminated its importance within the historical contexts of forestry and landscape engineering in Japan. Nonetheless, there has to date been no attempt to integrate these separate debates on Meiji shrine into an interdisciplinary approach. The result is that there exists as yet no analytical perspective on Meiji shrine in its entirety. Special mention is needed here of the recent research accomplished by Yamaguchi. Focusing on the construction of the shrine in the Taisho period, Yamaguchi has examined how Yoyogi came to be selected as the site for the shrine.27 Much is to be learnt from his wide-ranging studies of official documents and newspapers relating to domestic movements influencing the eventual construction of the shrine in Yoyogi. However, his research disappoints in its failure to take advantage of the plethora of material preserved in the Meiji Shrine Archives; and although he inquires into the shrine’s creation, he does not address the key question of how people actually used the shrine and its spaces. Moreover, Yamaguchi’s research is confined to the creation process of the shrine in the Taisho period. This shortcoming is one which Yamaguchi’s work shares with many of the studies that qualify for inclusion in both the first and second categories above as well. Noticeably, there has been no attempt to trace Meiji shrine history through to the postwar period. The present examination of Meiji shrine thus distinguishes itself from extant studies in both its interdisciplinary approach and its temporal span. It also takes full advantage of valuable archival records relating to the shrine’s establishment. This study combines material in the Meiji Shrine Archives with a wide range of official documents and newspaper articles available in national and Tokyo-based archives to construct a more comprehensive overview of Meiji shrine. Additionally, it addresses one vital issue that Yamaguchi overlooks, namely people and their use of the space of the shrine. As regards the methodology employed here, I no seiritsu katei.” On the shrine’s forest, see Matsui Mitsuma et al., Daitokai ni tsukurareta mori: Meiji jingū no mori ni manabu; Shinji Isoya, “Nō” no jidai. 27 Yamaguchi T., “Meiji jingū no seiritsu o megutte”; “Jinja hōshi chōsa kai ni tsuite 1”; “Nanitozo gochinzachi ni gosentei ainaritaku”; Meiji jingū no shutsugen.\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\nhave learned much from Ono’s recent examination of the performativity of space.28 Ono’s approach towards parks is of incalculable worth in that he seeks to elucidate the meaning of those spaces through a focus on how people experienced them. Furthermore, he contextualises the utilisation of the single space of the park through association with other spaces. This book employs a threefold analysis of spatial production in Meiji shrine. Firstly, I show how the discursive nature of space at the shrine is articulated into a distinctive place through the separation of place from space. The social production of space has been analysed in theoretical terms by scholars such as Lefebvre, whose ideas have in turn influenced the post-modern geographical approaches of thinkers like Harvey and Soja.29 Lefebvre argues that space is not a vessel to be filled with contents, but rather a socially conceptualised product, which “overlays physical space, making symbolic use of its object.”30 The importance of Lefebvre’s argument is that it focuses on the distinction between conceptualised space and physical space, which I interpret as implying a distinction of place from space.31 Here I am mindful of Harvey’s point that the separation of place from space is an essential precondition for any discussion of the spatial production.32 For example, in his discussion of ‘heterotopia’ Foucault was able to introduce his analysis of the power relations between actually lived ‘real places’ and heterogeneous ‘unreal spaces’ by focusing on the contradiction between them.33 The lack of\n\n28 Ono Ryōhei, Kōen no tanjō. 29 Henri Lefebvre, The Production of Space.

Soja, Post-modern Geographies; “Post-modern Geographies: Taking Los Angeles Apart.” 30 Lefebvre, The Production, 39. 31 Lefebvre, ibid. For Lefebvre, contrary to physical space “as defined by practicesensory activity and the perception of ‘nature’ ” (27), conceptualised space is “the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent—all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived” (38). 32 Harvey, Justice, Nature & the Geography of Difference, 261–4. Anthony Giddens, The Consequences of Modernity, 18–19. On the separation of place from space, see also: Homi Bhabha, “DissemiNations”; also Soja, “Taking Los Angeles Apart,” 133. 33 For Foucault, ‘heterotopia’ is “capable of juxtaposing in a single real space several spaces, several sites that are in themselves incompatible” (“Of Other Spaces,” 25. For Foucault’s observations on space: “Questions of Geography”; “Space, Knowledge, and Power.” For Foucault’s spatialisation of power, see also Soja, “Taking Los Angeles Apart,” 132–139. On Foucault’s power relations: “Panopticism”; “Afterword: The Subject and Power.” As for Foucault’s theory of power relations and power as productive, Dreyfus and Rabinow, for example, suggest that for Foucault “power is exercised upon the dominant as well as on\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nsuch a place-space distinction is the reason why Habermas’ discussion of the public sphere is often problematised.34 My aim in this book is to explore the social production of the apparently constant and unchanging space that was Meiji shrine. I discuss how various players, involved in making the history of Meiji shrine, shaped their own understandings of the space and how these understandings were in turn articulated into a distinctive place. The second key to my spatial analysis of Meiji shrine involves an understanding of the interaction between space formation and time formation; neither can be examined separately. Giddens’s argument for “the active articulation of time and space together” is especially relevant here.35 He proposes that there were three stages to the formation of modern timespace. Firstly, pre-modern local time, which had previously held sway in each particular locale, was disembedded from local place; this was the separation of time and space. In the second stage, time and place were distanced from each other, and from other times and other places (time-space distanciation). Finally, modern social systems reordered and recombined time and space through the standardisation of time-space measurement.36 Space formation (and modification) thus necessarily effected, and affected, the process of time formation itself; they are mutually constitutive. I apply Giddens’ insights to explore how the changing meanings of space and time can be integrated into one distinctive timespace. This book will shed light on the time and space of the shrine’s feast day, held on 3rd November to commemorate Emperor Meiji’s birthday. The third and final point in my analysis of Meiji shrine space involves a reconsideration of the performance dimension of space creation in order to understand exactly how the time-space was experienced and manipulated from within. In particular, I aim to explore the celebratory performances enacted on the shrine’s feast day. I am concerned with how ordinary people experienced the time-space of Meiji shrine on\n\nthe dominated: there is a process of self-formation or self-colonisation involved.” (Michel Foucault, 186). 34 For Habermas, the public sphere is “the realm of social life in which public opinion is formed” in which “access is guaranteed to all citizens.” See The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, 33. On the problematisation of Habermas’ argument, and following Lefebvre’s The Production of Space, Bartolovich argues that “Habermas’ ‘public sphere’ is, of course, a space and that all spaces—as all ‘publics’—are produced.” See Crystal Bartolovich, “Inventing London,” 16. See also Nancy Fraser, “Rethinking the ‘public sphere’.” 35 Roger Friedland and Deirdre Boden, “NowHere.” 36 Giddens, The Consequences, 1–53.\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\n3rd November, and how from their experiences the shrine space of Meiji shrine was constituted. De Certeau’s discussion is useful here in several respects: he carefully delineates place from space, he discusses the process of social production of time and space, and he analyses the dynamics of movement in spatialisation.37 For example, re-examining Foucault’s panoptic power production, de Certeau asks, “What popular procedures manipulate the mechanisms of discipline and conform to them only in order to evade them?”38 De Certeau shows that these popular procedures are not merely reactions by ‘consumers’ of the space, but are spatial practices through which “places are reconverted into spaces.”39 This insight opens the way for us to comprehend the ever-evolving space-place-space dynamic.40 One important fact that often goes unexamined is that the space of Meiji shrine consists of various component parts [Fig. 2]. Moving outwards from the centre of the shrine, there are the shrine’s inner precinct, the outer precinct, which itself includes different sites such as the Memorial Art Gallery and sports stadium, and finally the shrine’s approaches. Each of the chapters that follows sheds light on these separate yet inter-linked places and spaces, and frames Meiji shrine as a whole. The first chapter focuses on the creation of the inner and outer precincts, tracing the process of their construction from Emperor Meiji’s death in 1912 to the drama of their inauguration in November 1920. I explore the complexity of the religious situation in which the place for the deified Emperor Meiji was narrated and conceptualised as a ‘non-religious’ ‘Shinto’ ‘shrine.’ The fact that the inner precinct was built with central government funding, while the outer precinct was funded by the Meiji Shrine Support Committee (Meiji jingū hōsankai), hints at the multiplicity of motivations and movements behind the shrine’s creation. I discuss the 37 De Certeau, The Practice. On de Certeau’s observations of space, see also: “The Imaginary of the City” and “Conclusion: Spaces and Practices”; “Ethno-Graphy.” 38 De Certeau, The practice, xiv. On de Certeau’s re-examination of Foucault’s panopticism, see also “The Black Sun of Language,” “Micro-techniques and Panoptic Discourse.” On de Certeau and Foucault, C. Colebrook, “Certeau and Foucault: Tactics and Strategic Essentialism.” 39 Buchanan, “Extraordinary Spaces in Ordinary Places,” 4. Buchanan’s works are interesting in that he pays particular attention to de Certeau’s theory of space: e.g., “Heterophenomenology, or de Certeau’s Theory of Space.” 40 I have learned much from de Certeau’s work. For example, with reference to everyday time-space de Certeau asks about ‘doing’ as opposed to ‘being,’ and looks for spatial practices.\n\nintroduction\n\nFigure 2. The spatial structure of Meiji shrine, 1926. (Meiji Shrine Archives).\n\n11\n\n12\n\nintroduction\n\nways in which diverse understandings of the shrine were contested, negotiated and finally visualised and presented as reality. Academic modes of knowledge, adapted by specialists engaged in Meiji shrine’s creation, were utilised to integrate various concepts of the ideal shrine into one physical shrine. I examine too the layers of events, occurring on and around 3rd November 1920, that were held to commemorate the shrine’s establishment, in order to shed light on the dynamic role of the populace in the developing the identity of the shrine space itself. The second, third and fourth chapters approach the shrine through the themes of memory, city and body respectively. Chapter 2 focuses on the Meiji Shrine Memorial Art Gallery (Meiji jingū seitoku kinen kaigakan), constructed in the outer precinct. The purpose of the gallery was to provide a historical narrative of the Meiji period through 80 paintings depicting Emperor Meiji’s life. It was forever to serve the shrine as a mnemonic space. This chapter discloses the dynamic interaction between this mnemonic space and the commemorative practice it was intended to provoke, namely, the act of remembering. It took over 20 years from the initial planning of the gallery to its completion in 1936, and throughout the course of its creation different acts of remembering took place, both inside and outside the space of the shrine. Officials concerned with the documentation of Meiji period history carried out investigations in order to determine the most representative events of the Meiji period, and the events most appropriate as a record for posterity; these were not necessarily the same. Painters aimed to represent the realities of the events, while the physical constructors of the gallery strove to perfect the gallery’s narrative structure, such as the spatial arrangement of the pictures, and the building’s architectural details. The making of the gallery was a process of creating what was to be remembered. The space of Meiji shrine includes several approaches to the inner and outer precincts, which link the shrine to people’s residential spaces. The creation of new precincts and road space necessarily involves the transformation either of the pre-existing space or of its use; the practice of residing both causes this transformation and is part of it. The residents in the area themselves contributed to the shaping of the spatial identity of the shrine, and Chapter 3 expands discussion of this issue. The present shrine land covers parts of three Tokyo metropolitan wards, namely Shibuya, Minato and Shinjuku. However, when the shrine was constructed, most of its area fell outside the ward boundaries of the time. The boundaries of the shrine were continually redefined through the interplay between changing notions of the city and its suburbs. The evolution of city planning and the\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nconsequences of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake are examined here as two important factors which transformed both people’s modes of residing and the spatial identity of the shrine. I trace the process through which the shrine’s approaches and the surrounding residential areas were designated in 1926 as Japan’s first conservation zone, known as a fūchi chiku. It was the process of negotiation between city planners and residents that defined the boundaries of Meiji shrine space. The focus of Chapter 4 is the athletics ground located in the outer precinct and the Meiji Shrine Sports Meets (Meiji jingū taiiku taikai) held there. These meets worked as a nexus linking the shrine to people’s bodies nationwide. Previous scholars have critically examined the role of these meets, proposing that central government used them to manipulate and mobilise bodies throughout the nation. However, these propositions have not been backed up with evidence of how actual bodies and communities responded to the governments’ use of the meets. Here I analyse a wide range of local documents and newspapers, and reach a conclusion that is at odds with previous scholarship. Focusing on the 11th Meet, organised by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (Kōseishō) in 1940, I argue that the supposed unity and consistency of local and national bodies was a pretence on the part of central government. This particular occasion merits consideration because it was held in association with both the 20th anniversary of Meiji shrine and the 2600th anniversary of Emperor Jinmu’s enthronement. It thus provides an opportunity to examine how the shrine and the public were linked through sports activities. The ministry not only organised the meet at Meiji shrine on 3rd November, but also expected every local prefecture, city, town and village to hold its own simultaneous Meiji Shrine Sports Meet. An analysis of the meet therefore also promises to reveal how local people ‘lived’ the space of Meiji shrine on 3rd November. The fifth and final chapter discusses the post-war re-creation of the inner and outer precincts. The shrine’s post-war circumstances were quite different from those of the Taisho and early Showa periods. The shrine was reconstructed in the same ‘place’ but its spatial nature was quite distinct. I begin with an examination of how Western wartime policy-making regarding post-war Japan understood Meiji shrine, religion and Shinto, and how such policies affected GHQ’s treatment of Shinto. I then examine the negotiations between GHQ and various Shinto-related parties to determine the future status of Meiji shrine. The present status of the shrine was chosen from a number of possibilities discussed in these negotiations. An often neglected problem in considerations of post-war\n\n14\n\nintroduction\n\nShinto is the treatment of state-owned shrine land after state sponsorship was prohibited. The questions of who should own the outer precinct land and whether the precinct was a religious facility became issues of public controversy. The problem and its solution illustrate the fact that the shrine has always embodied Shinto’s religious/non-religious dichotomy. Finally, the chapter investigates the physical reconstruction of the shrine buildings and the commemorative performances for the celebration of the shrine’s reestablishment. The forms of the buildings and of the celebratory events, although they were realised as re-presentations of original forms, were both materialisations of the ‘new’ space and time of the shrine. Meiji shrine has always been a space both of, and in, unceasing contestation.\n\nChapter One\n\nThe Creation of Meiji Shrine 1912–1920 The Japanese practice of worshipping humans as kami has long been a subject of discussion and debate. The origin of human deification in Japan can be traced back to before the early modern period, and it is generally agreed that the worship of the living as kami began soon after.1 Shrines and monuments dedicated to the souls of historical personages became widespread from the modern period onwards.2 Meiji shrine and the deification of Emperor Meiji as kami can be firmly situated within this genealogy. My use of the term ‘genealogy,’ incidentally, should not be taken to imply some smooth and ordered progression; rather, I use it to refer to a process shaped by both difference and repetition. It has embraced frequently-recurring shared understandings of the practices of the deification and worship of men, and yet has also managed to incorporate within it ideas of complex divergence. For example, although Kozawa argues that the idea and practice of worshipping men as kami took root in Japanese society in ancient times, he also notes that we must recognise it took various styles, its social function was not uniform, and it was dependent on historical circumstances.3 The enshrinement of Emperor Meiji can be seen as precisely such a process of ongoing reiteration and variables. This chapter examines the formation of Meiji shrine’s inner and outer precincts, tracing the process from Emperor Meiji’s death (30th July 1912) to the inaugural events held to celebrate the shrine’s foundation in November 1920. The chapter is divided into three sections. The first section explores the various discourses concerning the shrine of the deified emperor, thus revealing the discursive nature of concepts such as Shinto, religion and shrine, through which the shrine was narrated and identified. The second section traces the stages through which various movements and organisations became involved in the process of shrine formation, and analyzes the concerns, ideas and motivations that physically constituted the shrine. I will consider the substance of domestic debates as\n\n1 Kozawa Hiroshi, Ikigami no shisōshi; Miyata Noboru, Ikigami shinkō. 2 Haga S., Shiseki ron. 3 Kozawa H., Ikigami, 197.\n\n16\n\nchapter one\n\nengaged in by individuals involved both in campaigns for Meiji shrine and in its physical construction. The purpose of this section is to make clear how the shrine physically materialised as one distinctive place. The final section of this chapter discusses the performance dimension of the shrine’s creation, and examines the ways in which events occurring there were institutionalised, understood and situated in society. Following its foundation, commemorative events were held annually on 3rd November at the shrine, and I focus especially on these events and examine how people physically experienced the congratulatory shrine feast festivities. 1.1 Concepts: Shrine and Emperor The complexity of the situation through which Meiji shrine emerged can be considered through the following aspects: firstly, the shrine as a product of the Taisho period; secondly, the shrine as sōken jinja (a state shrine dedicated to the spirits of imperial family members, loyal retainers and national heroes); and thirdly, as the site where Emperor Meiji was enshrined as kami. Regarding the first of these, a comprehensive understanding of the shrine is in fact only realisable through an appreciation of the social and religious context of the Taisho period. Enshrining historical personages at state shrines had been a distinctive feature of the Japanese shrine system from the Meiji period onwards. Later in the period, the government developed a legal and institutional argument which held that ‘a shrine’ was not a religious institution. This principle was seen as having been officially confirmed in 1900 when a Shrine Bureau (Jinjakyoku) was set up quite distinct from the Bureau for Religions (Shukyōkyoku).4 However, as Sakamoto suggests, questions pertaining to the religious quality of shrines only surfaced in the late Meiji and early Taisho periods: they led inevitably to the government creating, in 1929, a Commission for Shrine Research (Jinja seido chōsakai).5 The second significant aspect to Meiji shrine’s creation is that it was a sōken jinja shrine.6 I point to the particularities of a shrine built specifically for an emperor, in this case Emperor Meiji, and ask whether it is\n\n4 Sakamoto K., Kokka Shintō keisei katei no kenkyū, 284–335. 5 Ibid., 317–324; idem, “The Structure of State Shinto,” 280–85. 6 Murakami argues that Meiji shrine is the most representative of all the sōken jinja shrines developed under Kokka Shinto (Kokka Shintō, 182–92.)\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n17\n\npossible to interpret the meaning of sōken jinja shrines built for emperors differently than those built for loyal retainers or subjects. This question relates to the third significant aspect of Meiji shrine’s creation, namely that it was the site where Emperor Meiji was venerated as kami. Can we read the constructing of a shrine for Emperor Meiji in the same way as we can other emperors’ shrines? Indeed, are we even comparing like with like? Meiji shrine had been preceded by other state shrines, such as Kashihara shrine for Emperor Jinmu (founded in 1890) and Heian shrine for Emperor Kanmu (founded in 1895), but it was only in 1940 that the spirit of Emperor Kōmei (1831–1866) was enshrined, also in Heian shrine. Key here is the difference in the length of time taken, following an emperor’s death, to establish a shrine; Emperor Kōmei was enshrined 74 years after his death, whereas Emperor Meiji’s enshrinement came only eight years after he died. Crucially, the enshrinement of Emperor Meiji was not that of some mythical or historical figure; the shrine was established by people who had known him personally. 1.1.1 “The Invention of a New Religion” The publication of The Invention of a New Religion, Basil Hall Chamberlain’s provocative 1912 work on Japan, coincided precisely with the commencement of the Meiji shrine creation project, and it may serve here as a point of reference.7 Exploring the historical context in which Chamberlain’s argument and various counter-arguments were situated, and through which Meiji shrine was established, I suggest that the particular intellectual discourse that emerged in reaction to Chamberlain’s work affected the development of the understanding of Meiji shrine. Chamberlain’s argument was that Japanese religion had been manufactured in the twentieth century. He termed it “Mikado-worship and Japanese-worship,” or elsewhere as “the religion of loyalty and patriotism,” in which “preexisting ideas have been shifted, altered, freshly compounded, turned to new uses, and have found a new centre of gravity.”8 According to Chamberlain, Shinto was originally a primitive nature cult, which had already fallen into discredit. He argued that it had been rejuvenated as the nation’s new religion; vital support was lent it, he argued, by “highminded chivalry called Bushidō.” He further posited that the invention of 7 Basil Hall Chamberlain, The Invention of a New Religion; reprinted in appendix of Things Japanese, 5th ed., rev. 8 Chamberlain, Things Japanese, 5th ed., rev., 560.\n\n18\n\nchapter one\n\nthis religion of loyalty and patriotism was as yet an incomplete project: “It is still in the process of being consciously or semi-consciously put together by the official class, in order to serve the interests of that class, and, incidentally, the interests of the nation at large.”9 Scholars have long argued, and indeed are still arguing, about just what made Chamberlain write the article. Some have found an explanation in Chamberlain’s abhorrence of Japan’s 1910 annexation of Korea, and others in his hostility towards Lafcadio Hearn’s sympathetic understanding of Shinto, especially towards Hearn’s 1904 publication, Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation. Still others have found the origin of Chamberlain’s ideas in his disagreement with the idea of Bushidō as advocated by such Japanese intellectuals as Nitobe Inazō in his Bushidō, The Soul of Japan (1899).10 My interest lies in the fact that Chamberlain’s understanding of Japanese religion became a focal point for the arguments of those who shaped the intellectual discourses on religion, Shinto and Meiji shrine. The primary concern for Japanese intellectuals was how to solve the discrepancy between the government’s view that the shrine was not a religious institution and Chamberlain’s idea of Shinto as a new Japanese religion. Isomae emphasises the transformation ongoing at the time, pointing out that an understanding of the shrine as part of the domain of national morality had been dominant in the second half of the Meiji period, but that from around the 1890s a new kind of discourse was being developed and drawing support.11 In an attempt to overcome problems with the theory of the non-religious shrine, this new discourse saw the shrine as participating in the domains of both religion and morality. Similarly, Sasaki points out that the term ‘non-religious’ had different meanings when applied to ‘shrines’ and to ‘Shinto,’ and that the religiosity or lack thereof of the kami of the state shrines was continually transformed throughout the period.12 Regardless of his own supposedly non-political interest, Chamberlain’s ideas, and Chamberlain himself, became embroiled in the constant manufacturing of religious and non-religious discourses in Japan. 9 Ibid. 10 Lafcadio Hearn, Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation; Nitobe Inazō, Bushidō.

Tokyo City sponsored a series of commemorative lectures dedicated to Emperor Meiji and published them in anthology form, and commentators and lecturers probed and expounded upon the nature of Meiji shrine.13 Among them were Haga Yaichi and Inoue Tetsujirō, the most renowned propagators of the theory of national morality (kokumin dōtoku). An examination of the general opinion as articulated in these magazines, of Haga’s criticism of Chamberlain’s view of Japanese religion, and of Inoue’s moralityoriented understanding of the shrine, suggests how Meiji shrine came to be portrayed as the place for the propagation of national morality. The language employed in commemorative magazines shows a remarkable uniformity when referring to Emperor Meiji and his enshrinement. He is portrayed as the embodiment of the great achievements of Meiji civilisation. Tsukamoto Seiji, the head chief of the Foundation Bureau for Meiji Shrine (Meiji jingū zōeikyoku) in the Home Ministry, argued that the foundation of the shrine was in accord with the will of Emperor Meiji and of his age, and was the nation’s recompense for the great debt owed to its emperor.14 In addition, the deified emperor was depicted not only as an ideal figure, profoundly devoted to the kami and his ancestors, but also as a guide who taught, and could still teach, the way to worship kami. Indeed, more than a few writers at the time quoted poems composed by Emperor Meiji, such as: “Our country has been created by kami / Let us, descendants of those kami / Never forget the dutiful way / To display our indebtedness.”15 Nishimura Tamenosuke, a Home Ministry bureaucrat,\n\n13 For example, Kishida Makio, ed., Meiji jingū; Teien kyōkai, ed., Meiji jingū; Special issue on the establishment of Meiji shrine, in Jinja kyōkai zasshi 19, no. 11; and the Tokyo City edited volume, Meiji tennō seitoku hōshō kōenshū. 14 Tsukamoto Seiji, “Meiji jingū zōei no yurai,” 6–7; “Meiji jingū to kokumin no sekisei,” 204. 15 Yoshida Kumaji, “Gyosei ni arawaretaru goseitoku,” 486. Chiba Taneaki, “Seikun ippan,” 564.\n\n20\n\nchapter one\n\nemphasised that these poems were manifestations of the imperial will, and that they were highly instructive as well as being fine literature.16 Rather than dwelling on whether or not such kami worship was religious in nature, all the above authors tended to emphasise its moral implications. Yoshida Kumaji, a philosopher of education at Tokyo University, posited that there were three modes of kami worship, ‘religious,’ ‘philosophical’ and ‘moral’; he argued that it was the third of these three, the moral, which carried most weight.17 He made a strong case for the emperor’s mode of worshipping kami as constituting respect to those who had devoted themselves to the country, rather than religious reverence; this is Emperor Meiji as moral exemplar rather than devout worshipper. Yoshida argued that imperial morality was manifest in the emperor’s manner of worship; it was therefore the moral ideal for the nation as a whole. Therefore, for Yoshida, Meiji shrine’s emperor could be interpreted in two ways. It was firstly a moral place, in which people learned how to revere kami in the way Emperor Meiji did, and where they remembered his great deeds and his era in general. But it was at the same time a place which could display before the Japanese people the ideal way to be Japanese, so that they might learn from it and follow. In a lecture celebrating the shrine’s foundation, Haga Yaichi proclaimed Chamberlain’s The Invention of a New Religion to be a superficial observation of Japanese history.18 For Haga, the fact that the Japanese people deeply lamented the death of Emperor Meiji and had established Meiji shrine proved that emperor worship was not something acquired through learning; rather, emperor worship came naturally to the Japanese, and Chamberlain erred in his insistence that it was a modern invention promulgated through school education. Haga first made this observation in 1912 and frequently repeated it, even after his 1920 lecture.19 Indeed, from 1907, following the publication of his most representative work, Kokuminsei jūron, Haga consistently argued that neither emperor worship nor the shrine had anything to do with religion. As Haga made clear in his English presentation to the London Japan Society in 1917, Shinto was for him above all a national cult serving a national morality; what ­distinguished\n\n16 Nishimura Tamenosuke, “Meiji tennō gyosei o haishite,” 25. 17 Yoshida K., “Gyosei,” 102–104. 18 Haga Yaichi, “Meiji tennō.” 19 Haga Y., Nihonjin, 158; “Ōmigokoro.”\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n21\n\nShinto from Western religions was that in Shinto “there existed no prayers offered for the private or selfish interests of individuals.”20 Inoue Tetsujirō, who was a scholar of religious studies at Tokyo University, had begun from the end of the Meiji period onwards to investigate the functions of religion and Shinto.21 His theory of national morality differed relatively little from Haga’s argument, although he did not gainsay the religiosity of Shinto or shrines.22 Inoue was interested in an evaluation of Shinto and religion in terms of their relative contribution to the development of a national morality, and had theorised that Bushidō served to strengthen national morality; he now sought to use Shinto in the same way.23 An important point to note is that Inoue’s enthusiastic discourse on national morality had been the stimulus for Chamberlain to alter his stance regarding Shinto. His first edition of Things Japanese, in 1880, had provided a fairly neutral account, but by the time of the third revised edition in 1898 Chamberlain had enlarged the section on Shinto and added some rather more sceptical views regarding its new uses. To the original portrayal of Shinto was now added the critical comment that “some private scholars . . .—Dr. Inoue Tetsujirō, for example—have recently attempted to infuse new life into Shinto by decking it out in ethical and theological plumes borrowed from abroad.”24 His 1912 work, The Invention of a New Religion, was an extension of this revision. In a lecture dedicated to the shrine’s establishment, Inoue portrayed Emperor Meiji as an ideal, an embodiment of ‘Japanese spirit’ (nihon shugi).25 Japanese shrines were usually places of ‘social education’ (shakai kyōiku); and Meiji shrine in particular was a place for people to learn of the great achievements of Emperor Meiji and so develop their spirits within the ‘national polity’ (kokutai).26 Furthermore, he argued that shrines should place more emphasis on the principle and practice of Shinto, and should be educational institutions where the meaning of ‘Japanese spirit’ could be imparted to the nation. In arguing that Shinto\n\n20 Haga Y., Kokuminsei jūron.

Firstly, on 3rd November 1912 he established an academic society called the Meiji Japan Society (Meiji seitoku kinen gakkai), which was dedicated to Emperor Meiji and exists to this day as an organisation affiliated to Meiji shrine. Secondly, in the society’s journals and in other works he published numerous religious studies on Shinto, both in English and Japanese. Finally, his English works such as A Study of Shinto, the Religion of the Japanese Nation deeply influenced the formation of the Western understanding of Shinto (especially State Shinto), and therefore necessarily affected Western attitudes to Meiji shrine, as well as to Shinto, even in the post-war period.30 In his March 1912 work, Waga kenkoku shisō no hongi, Katō was also sensitive to Chamberlain’s proposition that Shinto was an invented new religion.31 Rather than denying Chamberlain, Katō proposed that it should be the task of Japanese scholars to propagate Shinto as a Japanese religion of filiality. For Katō the core aspect of Bushidō was emperor worship, which was religion, and thus Bushidō and Shinto should be considered one integrated religion of loyalty. Katō argued that Shinto was from very ancient times a theanthropic religion in which emperors were regarded as ‘Deus=Homo,’ in the same way as Western religions regarded God. For this reason Katō was keen to find evidence that Emperor Meiji had been 27 Dōchōshi (pseud.). “Jinja tai shūkyō,” 196; Inoue T., “Dōtokujō,” 227. 28 Katō Genchi, “Shūkyōgaku yori mitaru Meiji jingū,” 43–47. 29 Katō G., A Study of Shinto, the Religion of the Japanese Nation, ii. 30 For Katō and the Meiji Japan Society, see Kobayashi Kenzō, “Katō Genchi hakase no gyōseki,” 23–45.

This would allow him to suggest that a theanthropic religious tradition had re-evolved in modern Japan.32 Katō’s insistence that only Japanese scholars could uncover the truth of Shinto was inspired by Chamberlain and was developed as a founding principle of the Meiji Japan Society.33 His potrayal of Emperor Meiji as the ideal manifestation of a Deus=Homo existence necessarily implied that Meiji shrine was the centrepiece of this religion of loyalty. The shrine was expected to be a place of the utmost significance for the national integration of Japan, since Emperor Meiji was himself an embodiment of the elements composing the national polity, and an ideal for the Japanese people. The shrine-related discourses examined above were not necessarily compatible, and Meiji shrine is best understood in terms of its capacity to encompass different interpretations, albeit interpretations with many common features; differences and similarities coexisted within the frameworks (both physical and metaphysical) constructed around the shrine. In addition, this capacity emerged (and could only emerge) precisely because of Taisho period policies which decreed shrines to be irreligious. Shinto and Bushidō, both of which were seen by Chamberlain as modern inventions, were integrated by Katō into his theory of Shinto. He argued that although some Japanese did not consider Shinto to be a religion, in fact that was exactly what it was.34 Although Katō’s aim was to make Shinto understandable for Western academics, his Shinto studies actually stimulated further Shinto-centred argument and criticism in the West.35 1.2 Movements: Negotiated Construction On 1st May 1915 the Home Ministry announced that a shrine to be known as Meiji jingū was to be dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji and his consort, Empress Shoken; it was to be built in Yoyogi, Tokyo, and ranked as a major state shrine, or kanpei taisha.36 In order to achieve these aims the Home Ministry set up the Foundation Bureau for Meiji Shrine. Although the government clearly played a huge role in establishing the shrine, its 32 Katō G., Honpō seishi no kenkyū; “Meiji tennō no goseishi to goshintoku,” 734–53. 33 Meiji seitoku kinen gakkai, Meiji seitoki kinen gakkai shuisho, 3rd November 1912. 34 Katō G., A Study of Shinto, 2. 35 Katō’s influence on the understanding of Shinto in the West is discussed in Chapter 5. 36 Home Ministry Announcement No. 30, 1915; Naimushō, Meiji jingū zōeikyoku. Zōeishi, 62–64.\n\n24\n\nchapter one\n\nformation is often depicted as the result of a national non-governmental movement, since in many ways the shrine was a product of private groups and individuals.37 My argument stresses the importance of the interactions between these two blocs, those inside and those outside government. In order to grasp the shrine and its space as fully as possible, it is crucial to appreciate the ways in which governmental pronouncements concerning Meiji shrine influenced, and were influenced by both private individuals and by Japanese society in general. How then did the interplay of these multiple actors and movements with their various ideologies work together to form Meiji shrine? 1.2.1 Petition Campaigns and Youth Associations The government decided to create a shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji partly at least because a number of petitions for such a shrine had been submitted by local groups to the Home Ministry and to members of the Diet. The home minister, Hara Takashi, proposed petitioners postpone submissions until after the mourning period so as to be sure of their longterm commitment. Many were made within one month of Emperor Meiji’s death on 30th July 1912.38 For example, on 12th August a petition was submitted to Hara by a party that included Imaizumi Sadasuke. On 23rd August another petition was presented to the upper and lower houses, and on 29th September yet another was handed to the prime minister and his cabinet by associates of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Tokyo shōgyō kaigisho).39 As well as these Tokyo-based requests, there were other groups, such as one based in Hakone, which submitted petitions asking for a shrine in their town. As a result a proposal to construct a shrine was passed in 1913, firstly by the upper house on 27th February and then by the lower house on 26th March. The Home Ministry charged the Shrine Feasibility Committee (Jinja hōshi chōsakai) with carrying out a feasibility study on 22nd December.40 37 For example, the forest around the shrine was planted with over 95,000 trees, some eighty percent of them donated by individuals.

See also Daimaru M., “Meiji jingū no chinzachi sentei ni tsuite.” 40 With reference to these petitions and requests, Yamaguchi notes that immediately after the emperor’s death different commemorative ideas, such as founding a museum,\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n25\n\nLocal agents now began to launch campaigns to bring the shrine to their respective towns and villages. The Home Ministry reported that 40 different shrine petitions were submitted before the Feasibility Committee finally determined on 15th June 1914 to locate the shrine in Tokyo.41 The campaign of Hanno in Saitama Prefecture, for example, promoted the scenic area around Mt. Asahi as most suitable for the shrine. Hanno’s campaign took into account construction plans for the Musashino railway line, and included a new mountain resort to exploit the potential synergy of the railway, scenery and shrine.42 Similarly, 22 local petitions were submitted from villages and towns around Mt. Fuji. But the role of local players was not confined to these regional campaigns. As Yamaguchi has recently made clear, the Meiji shrine project was at least partly motivated and organised by agents of the capital itself. Indeed, the proposal of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry advanced through the elimination rounds, and became the basis for the plan that was ultimately adopted.43 Considering that the two main figures in the Chamber, the influential industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi (discussed in detail later) and the mayor of Tokyo Sakatani Yoshirō, were also members of the Feasibility Committee, it can be seen that the ideas and schemes behind the shrine evidently had considerable input from Tokyo itself, as well as from the national government.44 In order to understand the involvement of ‘ordinary people’ in the formation of Meiji shrine, it is important to study the activities of the youth associations, or seinendan. Indeed, the process of Meiji shrine’s formation was itself partly responsible for developing activities of youth associations across Japan.45 Tazawa Yoshiharu (1885–1944), already well known a library or an Emperor Meiji award, were also proposed in the newspapers. Besides the petitions mentioned above, various wards in Tokyo also organised petition movements. See Yamaguchi T., “Meiji jingū no seiritsu o megutte”; “Jinja hōshi chōsa kai ni tuite 1”; “Nanitozo”; Meiji jingū no shutsugen. As regards Tokyo-based movements, objections were made that these were attempting to create a shrine for the people of Tokyo alone; the point was made that such a shrine should be created for the whole nation (e.g. Ōoka’s commentary in Kokumin shinbun 4th Aug 1912). 41 Naimushō, Zōeishi, 10–13. 42 Yamaguchi T., “Nanitozo,” 17–19. 43 Yamaguchi T., “Jinja hōshi chōsa kai,” 13. 44 Naimushō, Zōeishi, 19. For example Honda Seiroku, the renowned forestry scholar engaged in the shrine forest’s creation, suggested that Shibusawa convinced him to agree to creating the shrine in Tokyo; Honda’s original idea was to position the shrine to make more use of ‘natural’ landscape, such as at the foot of Mt. Fuji. See Honda S., “Meiji jingū chinza sanjūnen, zōei no koro o kataru,” 21–23. 45 Takeda Kiyoko, Nihon liberalisumu no ryōsen, 186.\n\n26\n\nchapter one\n\nFigure 3.

Indeed, it was Tazawa who first put forward the idea of involving young volunteers in the construction work. Between 1919 and 1922 youth groups from all over Japan sent along about 100,000 of their 18–25 year-old male members to assist in the construction of both the inner and outer precincts [Fig. 3].46 It was this cooperation between members of youth groups from all over Japan that inspired the declaration in 1920 to create a national association for young people.47 Celebrating the completion of shrine construction and the development of the youth association network, the representatives of over 11,500 different groups jointly formed a nationwide campaign capable of independent fund-raising, under the slogan “One yen each.”48 Finally, with Tazawa playing a leading role, the\n\n46 Ibid.; Naimushō, Zōeishi, 425–8. 47 Tazawa Yoshiharu, “Seinendan no shimei,” 310. 48 Takeda K., Nihon liberalisumu, 186.\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n27\n\nJapan Youth Centre (Nihon seinenkan) was founded, and took its place within the outer precinct. 1.2.2 Ideological Interaction How might these movements be situated in relation to government policies? After all, neither the campaigns nor the youth groups developed independently from each other, or of their own volition. Here two members of the Home Ministry, Mizuno Rentarō and Inoue Tomokazu, prove to have been pivotal. Mizuno and Inoue were members of both the Shrine Feasibility Committee and the Foundation Bureau for Meiji Shrine, and they also played important roles in developing joint policy for the Bureau for Local Affairs and the Shrine Bureau, in particular relating to the Local Improvement Movement (chihō kairyō undō) and the so-called ‘theory of the shrine as centre of community’ (jinja chūshin setsu). It was through these joint policies that the two movements (local agent campaigns and youth group activities) first came to be related to the establishment of Meiji shrine. The dynamics of the relationships of such movements as the shrine petition campaigns and the youth associations with the creation of the shrine should be re-examined in comparison with, and in contrast to, the dynamics of the relationships that the government had with shrines, the regions, and youth education. As Miyachi notes, the Local Improvement Movement was founded by central government to encourage the development of self-governing local communities. Having established a degree of self-awareness, these communities were to be welcomed into the embryonic national community.49 It was Inoue who promoted this policy when he was head of the Bureau for Local Affairs. Similarly, soon after he became head of the Shrine Bureau in 1904, Mizuno began to stress the importance of autonomy for each local community, an autonomy that could be furthered by choosing one shrine, and only one, as its community-centre.50 Mizuno also pressed for an ideal shrine/community-centre relation that could serve as a theoretical and practical model for communities. He emphasised the local shrine as the central institution of the local community in 49 Miyachi Masato, Nichiro sengo seijishi no kenkyū, 4. 50 Mizuno Rentarō, “Jinja o chūshin to seru chihō jichi,” 1–6; “Jinja ni tsuite,” no. 1–2. Mizuno was also known as a strong promoter of shrine mergers (jinja gōshi). As Nitta suggests, Mizuno needed to promote mergers in order to ensure that all the shrines in the nation could be sure of sufficient financial support. See Nitta H., “Arahito gami” “kokka Shintō” toiu gensō, 184–5.\n\n28\n\nchapter one\n\nthe same way that state shrines were the pillars of the nation.51 One must consider the possibility that the local village campaigns aimed at luring Meiji shrine to their communities were developed under the influence of such policies, or were even pitched so as to highlight the incorporation of such policy into their respective village administrations. Furthermore, given that Inoue succeeded Mizuno as the head of the Shrine Bureau in 1908 and that soon afterwards Mizuno become head of the Bureau for Local Affairs, it seems inevitable that government policies influenced the process of shrine formation. As for governmental influence on youth groups, a key directive of the Local Improvement Movement was the development of education and associations for young people. When invited by the Bureau for Local Affairs, Tazawa delivered a series of lectures on the methods and techniques of youth education at several Local Improvement seminars.52 In 1915, the home affairs and education ministers made their first official ­references to youth associations, declaring that central government should encourage their development throughout Japan.53 Thus, through the support of government members and their involvement in campaigns and youth groups, the government played a vital, albeit indirect, role in the formation of Meiji shrine. The focus of my analysis now shifts towards the process of ideological negotiation and reinterpretation and its role in the intricate relationship between national government, local agents and young people. The appropriation of central government ideology by local agents supporting Tokyo’s campaign illustrates the degree to which ideology could be flexibly interpreted on the ground. Indeed, the interrelationship between the national government and Tokyo as a local agent was reflected in the shrine itself, in the relative positions of the inner precinct and the outer precinct. The inner precinct was to be built with central government funds, while the outer precinct was to be funded by public donations.54 While the Foundation Bureau for Meiji Shrine oversaw the project on behalf of the national government, a Meiji Shrine Support Committee (Meiji jingū hōsankai) was set up by interested Tokyo parties in order to attract money to build the outer precinct. The parties were Tokyo Metropolitan Prefecture (Tokyofu), Tokyo City and the Tokyo Chamber 51 Mizuno, “Shinshoku no tame ni,” 4; “Jinja chūshin,” 5; “Jinja ni tsuite,” no. 2, 2–6. 52 Miyachi M., Nichiro sengo, 74; Tazawa Y., “Seinendan no shimei,” 375. 53 Takeda K., Nihon liberalisumu, 192–193. 54 Meiji jingū hōsankai ed., Gaienshi, 47.\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n29\n\nof Commerce and Industry.55 As we shall see, these Tokyo parties played a significant role in the creation of the shrine space. As a sponsor of the outer precinct, the Support Committee was responsible for constructing the Memorial Art Gallery and the shrine approaches which linked the outer precinct with the inner precinct; the same trinity of Tokyo parties also separately became key figures in the hosting and organising of celebratory events for the shrine following its inauguration, and later established a similar organisation to the Support Committee, namely the Meiji Shrine Celebration Committee (Meiji Jingūsai hōshukukai), to “promote kami nigiwai” (festive activities to entertain kami).56 The role of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry was vital as it coordinated the trinity of Tokyo parties and thus the Support Committee. Indeed, the aforementioned proposal made by the Chamber to site the shrine in Tokyo on 29th September 1912 had already included a proposition to convene a support committee.57 It is worth noting here how Shibusawa Eiichi, a leading member of the Chamber, situated himself and the Tokyo petition campaign with respect to the national government. As one of the most influential industrialists of the period, Shibusawa was often asked to join the government, but he refused such requests and spent most of his life in independent business. His self-assigned objective was to defeat the elevation of public officials above the people (kanson minpi), and thus to promote entrepreneurship in Japanese society. During his lifetime, Shibusawa built up and aided some 500 different business organisations; the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry itself was established in 1891 largely through Shibusawa’s efforts.58 Through their coordinated actions and petitions, Shibusawa and the Tokyo parties thus aimed to contribute to the shrine creation independently of central ­government.\n\n55 Shibusawa seien kinen zaidan ryūmonsha, ed., “Jingū gozōei hōsan yūshi iinkai,” 514–29, “Zaidan hōjin Meiji jingū hōsankai,” 543–87. 56 Tokyo shōgyō kaigisho, Meiji jingū chinzasai, Tokyo jitsugyō ka hōshuku ni kansuru hōkokusho; Meiji jingū, Chōsashitsu, Meiji jingūsai hōshukukai ni kansuru kiroku. 57 Naimushō, Zōeishi, 56. Although the original idea made by the Chamber was for a Support Committee that would fund the outer precinct through the donations of Tokyo citizens only, Home Minister Hara’s suggestion influenced their decision to fund it from nationwide public donations. See Unoki Tadashi, Hakuraku Shibusawa ō, 6–60. 58 Shibusawa kenkyūkai, ed., Kōeki no tsuikyūsha • Shibusawa Eiichi. This book includes various useful discussions on Shibusawa.

When Tazawa’s idea of involving young volunteers in the construction work was summarily rejected by the head of the Foundation Bureau, Tazawa complained that members of the bureau were ignorant of the skills of his young people.59 Through his negotiation and persuasion, however, a trial was arranged for the Abeno County Youth Group, with which he was involved, and it was the success of this group’s work that triggered the great rise in work applications from other groups and enabled the project’s completion.60 Furthermore, it must be noted that the youth associations themselves were constantly appropriating and re-interpreting Tazawa’s original intentions. The reports issued by those who took part in voluntary youth work note that volunteers did of course set out for Yoyogi because “it was something expected by their community”; at the same time, however, such journeys were a “wonderful opportunity to satisfy their curiosity and interest.”61 The complex multiple interrelationships binding together each of the major actors in the Meiji shrine project must be examined in the round, with reference to the political and social background of Taisho Democracy.62 For example, Takeda maintains that Tazawa’s practice of encouraging the young in personal self-development through his youth association activities should be considered in the context of Japanese liberalism. Matsumura also suggests that Tazawa’s motivation was distinct from that of educators promoting a military-oriented youth education. Certainly, Tazawa himself strongly criticised the political and military manipulation of the youth associations.63 Tazawa’s motivations and aims, and the tactics he employed to achieve them, placed him firmly within the milieu of the times. Similarly, Shibusawa Eiichi was, in many ways, typical of the era. Indeed, it could be argued that he shaped Taisho Democracy just as much as it shaped him. He was able to appropriate and interpret flexibly whatever it was 59 Tazawa Y., “Meiji jingū gozōei bidan,” 71–80; “Kaku chihō seinendan no gozōei hōshi,” 96–100. 60 Tazawa, Y., “Seinendan no shimei,” 376–7. 61 Nihon seinenkan, Taikyū hōkōkai no ayumi. 62 Akazawa suggests the friction between the theory of the shrine as centre and actual experienced social reality may have stimulated the birth of the movements of the Taisho Democracy era. See Akazawa Shirō, Kindai Nihon no shisō dōin to shūkyō tōsei, 53–66. 63 Takeda K., Nihon liberalizumu, 218; Matsumura Ken’ichi, “Shakai kyōiku ni okeru kokumin kyōka no tenkai,” 221–2; Tazawa. Y., “Seinendan no shimei,” 320–24.\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n31\n\nhe needed to achieve his goals; he was involved with a huge variety of causes, pursuing the shrine’s creation while maintaining interests in other religious and philanthropic movements. For example, Shibusawa was deeply involved in the foundation and development of Association Concordia (Kiitsu kyōkai) in Japan. The express aim of this group was to create a synthetic religion that united all existing religions. Founded in 1912, Association Concordia gathered various thinkers, including religious leaders, scholars and industrialists, and stimulated debate between them on such topics as how Japan’s political and religious relationships with foreign countries could be improved.64 Shibusawa’s motivations for creating Meiji shrine were complex and comprised multiple influences and intentions. As with Tazawa, Shibusawa was at times in direct confrontation with national government, at other times in league with them. Any single interpretation of a process concerned with ideas must fail to elucidate the substance of a particular ideological form; any specific reason for the creation of Meiji shrine could easily have covered an entire spectrum of positions and motivations that were based upon the ‘fit,’ or lack of ‘fit,’ of multiple elements. In the conception of Meiji shrine, a number of priorities as well as schema were at times in conflict with one another. 1.2.3 Construction and Academia The preceding arguments have shown the variety of agenda and actions authored by the different actors in the shrine’s process of creation. I now proceed to ask how such complexities were integrated into one distinctive entity. I will focus on three important figures, all members of both the Shrine Feasibility Committee and the Foundation Bureau for Meiji Shrine: Itō Chūta, Doctor of Engineering, Honda Seiroku, Doctor of Forestry, and Miyachi Naokazu, Doctor of Literature. They employed different modes of knowledge for understanding shrine tradition, and finally produced the physical components of the shrine: its architecture, forest, and regalia, respectively. Various studies of their contributions to their academic fields have been made.65 As Aoi suggests, many of these studies are based on the\n\n64 For the association, see Nakajima Kuni, “Kiitsu kyōkai shōkō 1–2.” For the association and Shibusawa, see Shibusawa E., Seien hyakuwa, 406–730; George Ōshiro, “Shibusawa Ei’ichi and Christian Internationalisation,” 1–17. 65 For Itō, e.g. Igarashi Tarō, “Chokusen ka, kyokusen ka”; Maruyama Shigeru, “Itō Chūta to jinja kenchiku”; Suzuki Hiroyuki, ed., Itō Chūta o shitte imasuka. For Honda, e.g. Uchida\n\n32\n\nchapter one\n\n‘invention of tradition’ mode of analysis. It seems to me self-evident that the creation of Meiji shrine was an attempt to manifest ‘tradition’ through (re)invention of the shrine.66 However, I would like to emphasise the interactive process of this invention, in order to shed light both on the genesis and development of ideas relating to what the shrine should be and on the roles of negotiation and elaboration in stimulating further modes of knowledge. The question to consider with regards to Itō Chūta (1867–1954) is how he envisaged the final appearance of the shrine. Itō is regarded as the architect who established the history of Japanese architecture as a viable academic field; he became the first professor of this new academic discipline, at Tokyo University.67 From 1902 to 1905 he researched foreign architecture, travelling widely throughout Asia, the Middle East and Europe, aiming to locate Japanese architecture firmly within the framework of world architectural history. Although he was also the architect of Yasukuni shrine, Heian shrine and Tsukiji Honganji, Itō sought to establish the architecture of Meiji shrine as the standard for all shrines in Japan.68 The 6th meeting of the Shrine Feasibility Committee on 2nd July 1914 approved the proposals of its Consultative Group (Tokubetsu iinkai) regarding the shrine’s architecture: the Main Sanctuary (Honden) was to be built in the nagare zukuri style, and its building material was to be Japanese cypress [Fig. 4].69 Itō, who had been charged with responsibility for determining such matters, saw nagare zukuri as the most suitable due to its realisation of ‘genuine’ Japanese taste. He considered the taisha zukuri style to be too old and local in style, shinmei zukuri also as too old and furthermore unsuitable for broad-leaved trees, and gongen zukuri to be too gaudy.70 Itō sought to understand first and foremost what was required to turn architecture into a shrine; once this was accomplished, structures, styles and materials would ‘naturally’ fall into place. It is important to touch on Itō’s process of thought, since some historians assume\n\nMasayoshi, “Mori wa kōshite tsukurareta,” 27–48.

It is interesting to note though that, according to the proceedings from the first meeting of the Consultative Group on 1st May 1914, Itō’s proposal of the nagare zukuri style was contested by some who advocated a new ‘Meiji style’ shrine; their concern was to identify which aspects of the ‘spirit’ of the Meiji period should be made visible as shrine architecture.73 What, then, did Itō require of a shrine? ‘Authentic’ shrine architecture should, he claimed, keep harmony (chōwa) between straight and curved lines, between ‘indigenous’ and ‘Buddhist’ styles, and between ‘ceremony’ and ‘structure.’ For Itō, the ‘genuine’ Japanese taste of nagare zukuri 71 E.g., Fujiwara K., “Meiji jingū sōken ni miru nagare zukuri ishō no seiritsu katei,” 79–84. 72 Kokumin shinbun (6th August 1912). 73 Naimushō, Jinja hōshi chōsakai, Tokubetsu iinkai, Jinja hōshi chōsakai tokubetsu iinkai kaigiroku (daiikkai), 1st May 1914, 22–43.\n\n34\n\nchapter one\n\n“adapted and coordinated Chinese style most properly.”74 Xu highlights the significance of Itō’s consciousness of ‘Oriental’ identity, which he had developed on his travels through Asian countries.75 His experiences in Asia convinced Itō that by linking Japan’s culture firmly to this broader Oriental identity, Japan’s traditions, and thus its architecture, could be expressed in contrast to Western identity. Western cultures and their architecture were, for Itō, mirrors, reflecting what Japan and its architecture must become. This was to be accomplished by establishing a ‘native’ view of Japanese architecture, and by opposing the Western view of Japanese architecture propounded by Japan-resident architects such as John Conder and Bruno Taut.76 It may be appropriate to see Itō’s ‘precise definition’ of the shrine as having been formed through the prism of his Oriental identity. Honda Seiroku (1866–1952) was charged with responsibility for determining how best to develop the landscape of Meiji shrine. Honda had studied forestry abroad and created over 100 parks, including Hibiya Park, the first in the Western-style (seiyō kōen) in Japan. Many of his students were also involved in the creation of Meiji shrine. Honda and his followers, while drawing on Honda’s studies of foreign forestry, were concerned to differentiate and define Western-type park landscapes and the Japanesestyle shrine landscapes they were creating. Their definitions of what made a park ‘Western’ and a shrine forest ‘Japanese’ were to shape the development of the field of landscape design for many years to come. One of Honda’s students, Uehara Keiji, established the first technical school of landscape engineering in 1924 (and later the first such department in a Japanese university, at Tokyo University of Agriculture). It is therefore often claimed that the creation of Meiji shrine actually gave birth to a new academic discipline, that of landscape engineering.77 The creation of a ‘sacred’ and ‘solemn’ shrine forest was desired by all those involved with planning the shrine and its surroundings. However, exactly what constituted a shrine forest’s ‘sacredness’ and ‘solemnity,’ 74 Itō C., “Jinja kenchiku,” 9.

For the creation of Meiji shrine and the birth of a new academic discipline, see Shinji I., “Nō”no jidai,” 156–66.\n\nthe creation of meiji shrine\n\n35\n\nand how to differentiate it from the ‘park,’ became topics of considerable debate in the planning stage. Uehara criticised as regrettable the then current tendency for shrine precincts to be ‘park-like,’ and noted how many shrine precincts were veering towards profanity through the incorporation of parks within their precincts.78 However, the distinction between the two had been unclear ever since the introduction of the Western concept of the ‘park.’ Analysing the history of Japanese gardens, Shirahata suggests that the ‘park experience’ began for Japan in 1873, when the government proclaimed that this Western import was the ideal place for popular recreation. But rather than creating new parks, the government frequently re-designated existing shrine and temple precincts, as these were often the most appropriate sites for parks; indeed, even at the end of the twentieth century, many parks were in former shrine grounds and other familiar scenic places. Finally, with Honda’s creation of Hibiya Park in 1903, ‘the park’ was redefined in a new, government-authorised system: ‘proper’ parks had henceforth to be distinguished from, and created outside, shrine precincts, in contrast to most earlier parks which were nothing more than extensions to them.79 The boundary between the two thus shifted according to a redefinition of what constituted a ‘proper’ park or shrine precinct, so that the inner and outer precincts of Meiji shrine respectively stand for the relation between the ‘real’ shrine precinct and the ‘proper’ park. The 8th meeting of the Feasibility Committee, on 3rd November 1914, approved Honda’s plan for the shrine forest.80 The main objective was to create an ‘appropriate’ shrine forest, with ‘solemn’ and ‘sacred’ scenery, that was as close to a ‘natural’ forest as possible. The authorisation and creation of an ‘appropriate’ shrine forest thus became crucial to the committee. The aim was to create a forest capable of natural reproduction, which necessitated the planting of suitable trees. A careful study of the land allocated for Meiji shrine proved that broad-leaf evergreens, such as oaks, were the most suited to the soil; planning was long-term, with projections made for 100 to 200 years"
