It also helps you wander off the beaten path of Japanese film classics to discover works you’ve never had a chance to view or maybe never even heard of. Legendary but little-seen filmmakers like Heinosuke Gosho (“one of the greatest Japanese directors,” according to Georges Sadoul) or Sadao Yamanaka (“without him, there would be no Ugetsu, no Rashomon,” per Donald Richie) are represented, as are lesser-known titles by artists such as the Cannes-prizewinning Hirokazu Kore-eda and a reprise of Kinuyo Tanaka’s recently restored Love Letter.\n\n“If some of the narratives around shitamachi [are] about the marginalized, about economic inequality, about tight-knit communities and festivities, can we not find these stories [everywhere]?” writes curator Aiko Masubuchi, referring to the shitamachi spirit as well as the Tokyo neighborhood. “Cannot the ethos and the narratives that shitamachi has birthed and continue[s] to put forth today of resistance and of community practice and of laughter and joy be activated into lived experience?”\n\n—Jason Sanders, Film Notes Writer"
