        "text": "Answer: Akira Kurosawa was a Japanese filmmaker who was born in the Shinagawa ward of Tokyo in 1910. Kurosawa was initially a painter but became involved in film in 1936, working as an assistant director and scriptwriter before directing his first film 'Sanshiro Sugata' in 1943. Following this he went on to direct a further 29 films before his death in 1998.\n\n'No Regrets for Our Youth' was released in 1946 while 'Rashomon' was released in 1950 and won the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1951. As well as directing 'Ikuru', Kurosawa also co-wrote the film which features a Tokyo civil servant coming to terms with the end of his life.\n\n'Seven Samurai' was one of Kurosawa's best known films and was a long film (the original Japanese release in 1954 was 207 minutes long) set during the Warring States period of Japanese history in the late 16th century.\n\n'Throne of Blood' was based on William Shakespeare's play 'Macbeth' which transports the action from Scotland to 16th century Japan.\n\n'Yojimbo' was released in 1961 and is sometimes referred to as a \"samurai/western\" movie. The plot of the film was inspired in part by the 1952 Hollywood movie 'Shane'. Dersu Uzala was released in 1975 and won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nFor the 1985 film 'Ran' (which means 'chaos' in Japanese) Kurosawa again adapted a Shakespeare play, this time basing the movie on 'King Lear'. 'Madadayo' was Kurosawa's final film, released in 1993.\n\nSource: Author"
