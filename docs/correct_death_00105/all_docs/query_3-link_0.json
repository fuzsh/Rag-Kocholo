        "text": "Special ward in Tokyo, Japan\n\nFor other uses, see Shinagawa (disambiguation).\n\nSpecial ward in Kantō, Japan\n\nShinagawa (品川区, Shinagawa-ku) is a special ward in the Tokyo Metropolis in Japan. The Ward refers to itself as Shinagawa City in English. The Ward is home to ten embassies.\n\nAs of 1 April 2016 , the Ward had an estimated population of 380,293 and a population density of 16,510 persons per km2. The total area is 22.84 km2.[2]\n\nShinagawa is also commonly used to refer to the business district around Shinagawa Station, which is not in Shinagawa Ward. This Shinagawa is in the Takanawa and Konan neighborhoods of Minato Ward, directly north of Kita-Shinagawa.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nShinagawa Ward includes natural uplands and lowlands, as well as reclaimed land. The uplands are the eastern end of the Musashino Terrace. They include Shiba-Shirokanedai north of the Meguro River, Megurodai between the Meguro and Tachiai Rivers, and Ebaradai south of the Tachiai River.\n\nThe Ward lies on Tokyo Bay. Its neighbors on land are all special wards of Tokyo: Kōtō to the east, Minato to the north, Meguro to the west, and Ōta to the south.\n\nDistricts and neighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nShinagawa Ward consists of five areas, each consisting of multiple districts and neighborhoods:\n\nShinagawa District, including the former Shinagawa-juku on the Tōkaidō.\n\nŌsaki (大崎) District, formerly a town of that name, stretching from Ōsaki Station to Gotanda and Meguro Stations.\n\nEbara (荏原) District, formerly a town of that name.\n\nŌi (大井) District, formerly a town of that name.\n\nYashio (八潮) District, consisting of reclaimed land, including Higashiyashio on Odaiba.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of Tokyo east of the Imperial Palace is on reclaimed land. A large proportion of the reclamation took place during the Edo period, when Shinagawa-juku was the first shukuba (post town) in the \"53 Stations of the Tōkaidō\" that a traveler would reach after setting out from Nihonbashi to Kyoto on the Tōkaidō. The Tokugawa shogunate maintained the Suzugamori execution grounds in Shinagawa.\n\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system, Shinagawa Prefecture was instituted in 1869. The prefectural administration was to be set up in the Ebara District, but in 1871 Shinagawa Prefecture was integrated into Tokyo Prefecture. In 1932, during the reorganisation of the municipal boundaries of Tokyo City following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, a smaller version of Shinagawa Ward was created. On March 15, 1947, this was merged with the neighboring Ebara Ward to create the present Shinagawa Ward.\n\nThe Ward's historic post-town function is retained today with several large hotels near the train station offering 6,000 rooms, the largest concentration in Tokyo.\n\nThe Tōkaidō Shinkansen high-speed rail line began serving Shinagawa Station in 2003.\n\nPolitics and government\n\n[edit]\n\nShinagawa is run by an assembly of 40 elected members.\n\nEmbassies in Shinagawa\n\n[edit]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nCorporate headquarters\n\n[edit]\n\nMany companies are headquartered in Shinagawa Ward.

Marza Animation Planet also has its headquarters in Shinagawa on the 18th floor of the Tennoz Ocean Square near Tennōzu Isle Station.[32][33] And since August 2018, Sega Sammy, best known for its Sonic the Hedgehog franchise and also the owner of the Nakano-based TMS Entertainment (which itself owns the aforementioned Marza Animation Planet), has its headquarters in Shinagawa at the Sumitomo Fudosan Osaki Garden Tower near Ōsaki Station.\n\nJapan Airlines (JAL), the head office of its subsidiary JAL Hotels, and registered offices of JAL Express and JALways are located in the Tennōzu Isle area.[34][35][36][37][38] In addition, Jalux, a subsidiary, has its head office in the I·S Building.[39] One group of employees moved into the building on July 26, 2010, and one on August 2, 2010.[40]\n\nOn 8 July 2022, Nikon announced they have begun construction on a new headquarters adjacent to their Ōi Plan. [41] The Nikon HQ is supposed to be completed in 2024 and its address is: 5480-1, Nishioi 1-chome, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo\n\nFurther information: Nikon Ohi Factory\n\nOther offices\n\n[edit]\n\nOther companies maintain branch offices or research facilities in Shinagawa Ward. Sony operates the Gotenyama Technology Center and the Osaki East Technology Center in Shinagawa.[42] Sony used to have its headquarters in Shinagawa.[43] Sony moved to Minato, Tokyo around the end of 2006 and closed the Osaki West Technology Center in Shinagawa around 2007.[44][45] Adobe Systems maintains its Japan headquarters on the 19th Floor of Gate City Ohsaki near Ōsaki Station,[46] while Siemens AG has its Japan offices in Takanawa Park Tower.[47] Phoenix Technologies operates its Japan office on the 8th floor of the Gotanda NN Building in Gotanda.[48] Siemens Japan and Philips also have offices in Shinagawa.[citation needed] Microsoft and ExxonMobil have their Japanese headquarters in Konan, Minato, near Shinagawa.[49] Kojima Productions offices are also located in Shinagawa.
