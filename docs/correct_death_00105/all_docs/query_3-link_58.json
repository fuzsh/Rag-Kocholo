        "text": "Last year, I came across numerous news articles related to the Great Kanto Earthquake, and it appears that it has been 100 years since the earthquake occurred. Intrigued by this, I delved deeper into the news to investigate.\n\nJapan is one of the world’s leading earthquake-prone countries. About a century ago, a significant earthquake occurred in the Kanto region (the eastern part of Japan where Tokyo and Yokohama reside) , during which, amid the chaos caused by the earthquake, there was an incident in which many Koreans were murdered.\n\nMassacre of Koreans in the Great Kanto Earthquake\n\nMassacre or Self-Defense?\n\nExploring Historical Facts Through Contemporary Reports\n\nReported Wrongdoings by Koreans\n\nThe Truth Behind the Contemporary Reporting\n\nDefinition of Genocide\n\nWhat is Genocide Denial?\n\nUnable to Retrieve the Falsehood in Time\n\nThree Concrete Examples Supporting the Incident\n\nQuote from “Rashomon”by Akira Kurosawa on the Korean massacre following the Great Kanto Earthquake:\n\nQuoted from Hankyoreh Newspaper:\n\nA Fifth Grade Student Tells What he Saw of the Massacre\n\nCourt Records of the Killing of Koreans After the Great Kanto Earthquake\n\nEvidence Concluding a Series of Crimes by Koreans\n\nThe Japanese Government’s Stance on the Massacre of Koreans\n\nVanishing Records and a Denial of the Massacre by the Japanese Government\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Government’s Stance\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Assembly Members Upholding Misinformation and Governor’s Response\n\nGovernor Yuriko Koike’s Evasive and Lackluster Response\n\nHate Speech Still Allowed?\n\nReactions of the Public When New Historical Documents Emerge\n\nDid they massacre them because they were Japanese?\n\nJapanese Who Protected Koreans\n\nTsunekichi Ōkawa\n\nRelated News Coverage\n\nReferences\n\nRecommended Books on the Korean Massacre\n\nMassacre of Koreans in the Great Kanto Earthquake\n\nApproximately four years after the independence movement in which Koreans protested against imperialism and forced assimilation into Japanese culture, on September 1, 1923, around noon, a massive earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 occurred.\n\n7.9 earthquakes are horrendous, especially for that time period. Buildings toppled and demolished, as well as fires breaking out devastating cities.\n\nDue to unfortunate timing, it was lunchtime, and as a result, collapsed buildings were quickly engulfed in a sea of flames. It is said that the number of dead and missing exceeded 105,000 throughout the Kanto region. Among them, 1% to several percent were not direct victims of the earthquake but were Koreans who were massacred. At that time, there were about 80,000 Koreans in Japan nationwide.\n\nMassacre or Self-Defense?\n\nAfter the March 1st Independence Movement, the Japanese authorities and the public, wary of the growing Korean independence movement, received information such as\n\n“Koreans are planning a riot.”\n\n“Koreans are destroying bridges.”\n\n“Koreans are committing arson.”\n\n“Koreans are repeatedly committing rape.”\n\n“Koreans are poisoning wells.”\n\nThe head of national security, the director of the Home Ministry Police Security Bureau, issued a nationwide notice stating, “Koreans are setting fires in various places, and some are carrying bombs, so strict measures should be taken,” leading to the declaration of martial law.\n\n“Try saying ’15 yen and 50 sen.'” (jyugoen gojyussen*)\n\nThis phrase was used during interrogations at checkpoints to identify individuals as Koreans, as in the Korean language this cannot be said without an accent, making it challenging for those who couldn’t pronounce it correctly.\n\nMartial law soldiers, police officers, vigilantes, and others set up checkpoints in towns, conducted inspections, and indiscriminately killed Koreans on the streets. Murders by the Japanese military, police, reservists, firefighters, and civilians occurred everywhere, primarily from the 3rd to the 5th day, as confirmed by various testimonies, records including children’s drawings and diaries witnessing the events.\n\nAdditionally, incidents of massacres of Japanese mistakenly identified as Koreans and murders of labor activists and anarchists by the military during the confusion also occurred.\n\nHowever, in recent years within Japan, there has been a noticeable presence of denialists of the massacre (those who argue it was not a massacre but rather unavoidable self-defense, labeling it as murder or just straight up denial that any murders took place). As discussed later, this perspective has had an impact on the government’s stance and public knowledge of the event.\n\nExploring Historical Facts Through Contemporary Reports\n\nReports of Korean riots were actively propagated by Masutaro Shoriki, who later became a prominent figure in politics and the media as a member of the House of Representatives, owner of the Yomiuri Shimbun, and director of the Nippon Budokan. Driven by a sense of righteous anger, it is known that Shoriki actively spread these reports during his time as the head of the Public Relations Division at the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nRecords also indicate that Shoriki, while at the Metropolitan Police Department, requested newspaper reporters who had rushed there, saying, “There are rumors that Koreans are plotting a rebellion; please go around and investigate.”\n\nReported Wrongdoings by Koreans\n\nMinami Nihon Shimbun reported:\n\n“Rampant Acts of Wicked Koreans – Taking Advantage of Chaos, Attacking Refugees”\n\n“Reckless Actions of Wicked Koreans – Are 3,000 Koreans Planning Some Operation?”\n\n“Preparing for Wicked Koreans – Increased Vigilance in the Imperial Capital”\n\nNewspaper articles held at the National Diet Library state:\n\n“1,000 Wicked Koreans Begin Battle in Yokohama, Entire Infantry Squad Annihilated – Additional Dispatch of a Platoon from Aso General Headquarters”\n\n“Conspiracy of Koreans – Setting Fires Taking Advantage of the Earthquake Damage, 3,000 Stirring in Tokyo – Arrests Proving Extremely Difficult”\n\n“Group of Koreans Assaulting Power Plants”\n\nThese headlines depict a situation reminiscent of a civil war.\n\nIn books authored by current advocates of denying the Korean massacre, the aforementioned newspaper articles or similar ones from that time are cited as primary historical sources. Based on this, they unilaterally conclude that those who were killed were not entirely innocent.\n\nCertainly, if a group were to engage in such violent and disorderly behavior amidst the suffering caused by the earthquake, it might lead to thousands of casualties for the purpose of suppression.\n\nAfter all, they were dealing with a group that had instigated a riot using force strong enough to annihilate an entire infantry squad.\n\nThe Truth Behind the Contemporary Reporting\n\nHowever, it turns out that the newspapers were entirely deceptive. This fact was easily confirmed later through various historical sources.\n\nSurprisingly, despite the events reported in the newspapers, not a single Korean was arrested or detained.\n\nIn addition to depicting the violent actions of Koreans, newspapers repeatedly published falsehoods such as “Izu Oshima Sinks,” “Mount Fuji Erupts,” “Nagoya in Ruins,” and more.\n\nSoon after, the government realized the baselessness of these rumors and began denying them. The police, in a sudden shift, started protecting those of Korean Peninsula origin.\n\nEven Masutaro Shoriki, mentioned earlier, later acknowledged the error in the response.\n\nRecords also show that the Metropolitan Police Department and the Martial Law Headquarters at the time attempted to counteract such misinformation.\n\nDefinition of Genocide\n\nLet’s revisit the definition of genocide here.\n\nGenocide is the act committed by a group of two or more individuals based on religion, ideology, advocacy, group, ethnicity, politics, organization, or by a village, state, or military, with a specific purpose or assertion, killing non-combatants or ordinary civilians who are in a state of non-resistance and unable to resist, and it does not qualify as murder under the Geneva Conventions concerning combat.\n\nGiven this definition, one might find it difficult to argue that this case does not qualify as genocide.\n\nWhat is Genocide Denial?\n\nMany instances of genocide denial can be considered typical examples of cherry-picking. A sincere investigation into the events reveals errors in the newspapers of that time, which even a foreigner like me can confirm. This highlights the authors’ of genocide denial lack of integrity, laziness and seriousness in dealing with history.\n\nUnable to Retrieve the Falsehood in Time\n\nThe leaflet distributed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police at the time stated:\n\n“Spreading false information will result in punishment. Many have been punished for spreading rumors about the violence of Koreans, the recurrence of a major earthquake, or prisoners escaping. Please be cautious in these times.”\n\nHowever, acts of violence did not immediately subside, with citizens in various locations dragging out and attacking Koreans who were under police protection.\n\nIn an incident, a crowd surrounding the Gunma Prefecture Fujioka Police Station became unruly, dragging out 17 Koreans who were under custody and subjecting them to a massacre. Similar incidents occurred in several places.\n\nThree Concrete Examples Supporting the Incident\n\nOne well-known testimony comes from the globally acclaimed film director Akira Kurosawa, famous for his work Seven Samurai.\n\nQuote from “Rashomon”by Akira Kurosawa on the Korean massacre following the Great Kanto Earthquake:\n\n“Someone said not to drink the well water from a certain house in the neighborhood. Why? Because there were strange symbols written in white ink on the ditch outside the well, indicating that Koreans had poisoned the well. I was terrified. The truth is, those strange symbols were graffiti that I had drawn. Watching these adults, I couldn’t help but shake my head at what it means to be human.”\n\nHere’s another specific example:\n\nQuoted from Hankyoreh Newspaper:\n\nOn September 4, Japanese people shouted, “Catch the Koreans!” and “Kill the Koreans!” Rumors spread after the Great Kanto Earthquake that Koreans had “poisoned wells” and “started fires.” In response, a group composed of military and police, along with civilian “self-defense squads,” engaged in the massacre of Koreans. Armed with Japanese swords and “Tobikuchi” (a tool for firefighting with a long pole and a blade), Japanese individuals began searching for Koreans in the crowd. The self-defense squad approached Im Song-il, a Korean laborer working at the construction site of the Arakawa embankment. Im, who did not understand Japanese, shouted to Shin, who could speak Japanese, to act as an interpreter. Almost simultaneously with the shout, the self-defense squad attacked Im with a Japanese sword, fatally injuring him.\n\nHe believed he would be killed if he stayed there, so he jumped into the Arakawa River. Another Korean also jumped in. Gunshots were heard, and the swimming Korean sank to the riverbed. He and his younger brother hid in the reed fields, but they were captured by a self-defense squad that arrived on a boat. The self-defense squad struck him with a Japanese sword. He blocked the sword with his left hand, resulting in the loss of his left pinkie. He resisted by trying to take the sword but to no avail. He fainted as other self-defense squad members attacked him. A large wound from the Japanese sword remained on his left shoulder, and he sustained various injuries on his head and body.\n\nJapanese individuals transported the Korean corpses to the Terajima Police Station. The corpses were carried with “Tobikuchi,” similar to how one would carry a large fish hooked at a fish market. He was also taken to the Terajima Police Station. A wound from a Tobikuchi remained on his left leg. His younger brother, Humbom, who had been brought to the police station with him, helped him when he lost consciousness. The slightly less injured brother, stacking the bodies like stacking fish, heard his brother’s voice asking for water from the gaps between the piled corpses. After drinking the water his brother gave him, he held on for about a week before regaining consciousness. Officials from the Korean Governor-General’s Office visited him when he regained consciousness, promising to take him to the hospital. He was transported to the hospital, but the treatment involved applying disinfectant called “Aka-chin.” The nurse seemed more concerned with monitoring the movements of the Korean than providing care. When he was discharged, among the 16 people in the same hospital room, only 9 survived.\n\nSource: The Hankyoreh – https://japan.hani.co.kr/arti/international/28407.html\n\nA Fifth Grade Student Tells What he Saw of the Massacre\n\nFinally, here is an excerpt from a composition written by a fifth-grade student at a Yokohama elementary school at that time: (translated by Kelly)\n\n“Because the Koreans ran away, all the adults went to the Korean village with iron rods. They killed the Koreans with iron rods and threw the killed Koreans into the sea in front of the fish market.”\n\nCourt Records of the Killing of Koreans After the Great Kanto Earthquake\n\nIn the course of this series of events, 367 individuals were charged with the crime of killing 233 people of Korean descent immediately after the earthquake. During the trials, there were statements such as, “Believing the rumors, we thought that if Koreans came to our village, we should capture them and eliminate harm for the sake of the villagers.” This suggests that alongside discriminatory attitudes, a desire to be useful for the community contributed to the killings.\n\nFurthermore, those who mistakenly killed Japanese individuals were given prison sentences, but most of the defendants who killed Koreans not only received suspended sentences but were also honored with a tree planted in a shrine in a village in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, as a tribute to their efforts in protecting the village.\n\nEvidence Concluding a Series of Crimes by Koreans\n\nAccording to a post-disaster report from the Ministry of Justice, “There was no systematic misconduct by Koreans under a specific plan,” refuting claims of riots and such. (“Investigation Report on Criminal Offenses and Related Matters After the Earthquake”)\n\nThe police chief of Kanagawa (Commander of the Kanagawa Security Force) thoroughly investigated the rumor that Koreans had committed crimes, stating, “We thoroughly investigated the rumors that Koreans committed wrongdoings, but they were all baseless.” (translated by Kelly)\n\nWhile there were indeed some individuals of Korean descent convicted of crimes, all of them were charged with relatively minor offenses like theft.\n\nThere are numerous direct testimonies of killings by Japanese individuals, but there is no confirmed testimony of witnessing riots or destructive activities carried out by individuals of Korean descent.\n\nThe Japanese Government’s Stance on the Massacre of Koreans\n\nIn a report compiled by the Japanese Cabinet Office in 2008, the mechanism through which information spread was analyzed.\n\nAmong the 17 major newspapers at that time, a staggering 14 had collapsed, leading to an information vacuum. The report suggests that the loss of living spaces for many evacuees, along with their anxiety, coupled with a lack of knowledge, contributed to the dissemination of misinformation and rumors.\n\nIn 2009, under the administration of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Central Disaster Management Council of the Cabinet Office’s “Special Investigation Committee on the Inheritance of Disaster Lessons” mentioned in the “1923 Kanto Earthquake Report Volume 2” that the victims of the massacre accounted for 1% to a few percent of the deaths caused by the earthquake, within the context of “the expansion of chaos” and “the occurrence of killing incidents.”\n\nVanishing Records and a Denial of the Massacre by the Japanese Government\n\nHowever, in 2023, the 100th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake, the Liberal Democratic Party changed its opinion, stating that “there are no records within the government that can ascertain the facts.”\n\nDespite the abundant evidence in court records and other official documents, the government’s decision to change its stance in 2023, claiming a lack of understanding within the government, raises questions. The 2009 stance from the Cabinet Office’s Central Disaster Management Council, asserting that the victims of the massacre accounted for 1% to a few percent of the deaths caused by the earthquake, was made without any apparent evidence. This situation calls for accountability from those responsible for spreading unfounded fantasies, yet there seems to be a lack of voices seeking an investigation.\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Government’s Stance\n\nIt had become customary for the Tokyo Governor to send a condolence message every September 1st during the memorial service for the victims of the Korean massacre. However, since 2017, Governor Yuriko Koike has discontinued the practice of sending condolence messages.\n\nTokyo Metropolitan Assembly Members Upholding Misinformation and Governor’s Response\n\nOne of the incidents stemmed from the questioning by Shunakatsu Koga, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly (Liberal Democratic Party). The following is a quote from the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly proceedings:\n\nSource: Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly https://www.gikai.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/netreport/2017/report03/08.html\n\nExcerpt from the preamble: (translated by Kelly)\n\nI have a book that I strongly recommend Governor Koike to read. It is ‘The Truth of the Korean Massacre in the Great Kanto Earthquake’ by non-fiction writer Miyoko Kudo. Ms. Kudo thoroughly examined documents stored in the police, fire department, and public institutions. According to her research, the total number of deaths and missing persons in the earthquake was 2,700. Among them, around 800 Koreans were believed to have been killed, either by illegal acts committed by Korean independence activists or due to being incited by them. Additionally, approximately 233 Koreans are thought to have been accidentally killed due to excessive self-defense.\n\nThis book was serialized in “SAPIO” and is currently published as a single volume by Sankei Shimbun.\n\nThe claim that over 6,000 Koreans were killed lacks substantial evidence, as indicated by the national census data. The first national census in Japan was conducted three years before the Great Kanto Earthquake, in 1919. According to the census data on nationality and population, the total Korean population in Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, and Kanagawa combined was 3,385.\n\nRegarding the spread of rumors, it is essential to consider the security situation in our country at that time. About four years before the earthquake, Korean activists who were involved in the March 1st Independence Movement on the Korean Peninsula came to Japan. Many of them, supported by the Soviet Union and Japanese anarchists, frequently engaged in incidents. This information is confirmed by existing newspaper articles from that time.\n\nMoreover, these activists were preparing harmful actions around the time of the marriage of the then Crown Prince, who later became Emperor Showa. Numerous incidents of heinous crimes during the earthquake have also been extensively reported in the media.\n\nIn the context of such social and security conditions, it might be inappropriate for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to adopt a stance explicitly stating that Japanese vigilante groups became overly sensitive and killed unrelated Koreans during the earthquake. Instead, shouldn’t the government strive for a fair and neutral position?\n\nBy the way, in the year 2023, six years from now, it will be the centennial of the Great Kanto Earthquake. In light of the recent revelation that Asahi Shimbun and the fabricator Yoshida Seiji concocted and disseminated the entirely fictional story of forced mobilization of comfort women, which was propagated worldwide, it cannot be denied that as the centennial approaches, there may be a call for Japan to apologize and compensate for the Korean victims of the Great Kanto Earthquake. Therefore, the governor’s decision is significant and weighs heavily on national interests.\n\nThe Yokoamicho Park, run by the public interest foundation Tokyo Irei Kyokai, will attract many foreigners in 2020 for the Tokyo Olympics. The pamphlet for children issued by the foundation, titled “Explore! Yokoamicho Park,” adorned with the popular Pokémon on its cover, with ruby annotations and easy-to-understand explanations throughout, is commendable. However, the photo of the relevant memorial is labeled as containing “incorrect rumors,” and the unfamiliar term “Asia-Pacific War,” a leftist expression, is used. This is something that should be reconsidered.\n\nThe suggestion is to refrain from installing or exhibiting figures or descriptions in public facilities in Tokyo that deviate from historical facts, and instead, implement measures, including removal, to rectify this. I would like to hear the governor’s opinion on this.\n\nShunakatsu Koga\n\nGovernor Yuriko Koike’s Evasive and Lackluster Response\n\nIt is surprising that Representative Koga brought up Kudo Midoko’s “The Truth of the Great Kanto Earthquake: Massacre of Koreans” as a source. As mentioned earlier, this book, along with most denialist works, relies on sensationalized newspaper articles from that time. The common argument is that it wasn’t a massacre but justified (excessive) self-defense.\n\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s perspective on the matter is that she attended the Great Kanto Earthquake and Memorial Service for War Victims in Tokyo in March, expressing condolences to all those who lost their lives in the Great Kanto Earthquake as part of her role as the governor. She emphasized that regardless of the various historical perspectives, her intention to offer condolences to all those who lost their lives in the significant disaster of the Great Kanto Earthquake and its aftermath remains unchanged.\n\nWhen questioned by reporters about the distinction between those who died in a natural disaster and those who were killed, Koike acknowledged that there might be different historical interpretations but reiterated her commitment to offering condolences to all individuals who lost their lives due to the Great Kanto Earthquake and its aftermath.\n\nIn a regular press conference marking the centennial of the massacre in 2023, Governor Koike stated, “What is a clear fact is something historians need to unravel.” This suggests that, with the available evidence, the clarity of the historical truth remains a complex matter that historians need to further investigate, and it may not be definitively resolved even after a century.\n\nHate Speech Still Allowed?\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government permits a hate speech group to hold a gathering on the same premises where the memorial service for the victims of the massacre takes place, annually on the day of the memorial event. Despite designating the group as engaging in hate speech, the Tokyo government issues permits for their assembly, citing concerns about potentially infringing on freedom of expression.\n\nThis raises interest as the government, with an apparent commitment to protecting the freedom of expression of a group recognized for hate speech, deploys a significant number of police officers. The debate over whether hate speech is considered freedom of expression has concluded in many Western countries, but it remains a contentious issue in Japan.\n\nWhile Japan’s Ministry of Justice opposes hate speech, it seems that the Tokyo Metropolitan Government could have denied permission based on this stance. Some argue that Tokyo may eventually use on-site confusion as a pretext to prohibit or work towards the removal of the Korean memorial service itself, or the removal of the memorial monument (as seen in the successful case by the same group in Gunma Prefecture).\n\nReference: TBS\n\nReactions of the Public When New Historical Documents Emerge\n\nIn the midst of this, new historical documents have emerged.\n\nQuoted from: Hankyoreh Newspaper\n\n“On September 4th, over forty Koreans were all killed”… Another discovery of Japanese official documents related to the Kanto Massacre after the Great Kanto Earthquake.\n\nThe document was created in response to the Vice Chief of the Army Ministry (equivalent to the Chief of Staff) instructing all units related to the earthquake to report the details of the investigation by November 25, 1923. The Kumagaya Regiment Headquarters submitted the materials after the deadline, on December 15. Since the materials from the Kumagaya Regiment Headquarters are still available, there is a possibility that documents from other units are stored somewhere. According to investigations by Japanese civic organizations, an estimated 223 to 240 Koreans were massacred in Saitama Prefecture.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/7ae488b7357087bed865a3912bf09154dc21447e/comments\n\nPublic comments on this news are as follows:\n\nThe top three comments are presented in order of popularity.\n\nOf course, these opinions do not represent all Japanese citizens, but they undoubtedly reflect the genuine feelings of some individuals.\n\nIf this article is true, it tells the story of how the authorities (police) tried to protect Koreans, but an enraged mob ended up killing them. Without discussing the underlying reasons why Koreans were believed to have killed Japanese or spread rumors about poisoning wells, and how these beliefs led to the killing of many Koreans, there is a possibility that similar incidents could occur again. I believe there were isolated acts of violence, but I do not think there was organized genocide.\n\nter******** (translated by Kelly)\n\nThe thing is, they haven’t been hiding or denying these aspects around here. They acknowledge the parts that have been publicly confirmed and even engage in memorial services and tributes, right? They are simply denying the inflation of the number of victims over time. While some people have started to claim that the incident itself never happened, they are a minority. In the first place, it’s a story from an unverifiable past. It’s not like they were systematically exterminated like the Jews or forcibly repatriated after the war. How long are they going to keep talking about this? These people. I want the Japanese government to take a more decisive attitude. They don’t do anything, do they? The Japanese government, I mean.\n\nnov******** (translated by Kelly)\n\n“What was decided in the Japan-Korea Claims Agreement should have been settled, and the idea is that after the agreement, both countries should move on. Bringing up events from 100 years ago, making various claims, and trying to profit from it should stop. If Japan and Korea start arguing, there will be no end to it.”\n\nhid******** (translated by Kelly)\n\nWithout any data, it’s just my gut feeling, but except for a vocal minority on the internet, the overwhelming majority of Japanese people have absolutely no interest in this matter. Therefore, with the preamble of ‘actually,’ it becomes easier for people to uncritically accept information that they encounter frequently.\n\nDid they massacre them because they were Japanese?\n\nOf course, it’s natural to present tragic events that happened in Japan without framing it as Japanese people being particularly barbaric, so there is no misunderstanding. Regardless of nationality or race, this event serves as a lesson to humanity that, when people are pushed to extremes and tormented by fear, they can easily go out of control.\n\nEven in such a chaotic backdrop, and amid the Cold War era, there were many Japanese who assessed the situation, made morally upright decisions, and acted as human beings. In Maruyama, Hōten Village, Hōten District, Hōten Village, Chiba Prefecture, there are records of entire villages protecting Koreans.\n\nIn the town of Teraoka in Honsen, Kodama District, Saitama Prefecture, the owner of the Ogihara Silk Factory, Motoyoshi Ogihara, hid three Koreans in a warehouse. Despite demands from the vigilante group, Ogihara did not comply. On the evening of the 4th, he took the three individuals to the Honjo Police Station, refusing the demands of the vigilante group, and records indicate that the individuals were protected on the second floor of the police station with the intervention of the station chief.”\n\nJapanese Who Protected Koreans\n\nRegardless of the East or the West, in times of emergency, when fear and anxiety grip people, they tend to succumb to mob psychology.\n\nAt that time in Japan, Koreans were a discriminated ethnic group, and some people identified them as potential terrorists after the March 1st Independence Movement. The post-disaster incitement by the military, police, and media, coupled with the fact that people lost their composure, contributed to the situation.\n\nAmidst the circumstances where people were fervently taking to the streets with the intention of retaliating against Koreans, choosing to protect Koreans meant a very high likelihood of disaster befalling the person making that choice. There was absolutely no gain in it. The best course of action in such a time was to decide to turn a blind eye, and this is what happened in the background of that era.\n\nTsunekichi Ōkawa\n\nOne of the most famous examples is Tsunekichi Ōkawa, the police chief of Tsurumi Ward in Yokohama City.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 2nd, four foreigners were brought to Tsurumi Police Station by a crowd, with one of them being pushed around. According to the crowd, the foreigners were accused of poisoning a well. The foreigner in question was clutching a bottle to his side.\n\nAs the crowd claimed that the contents of the bottle were poison, Okawa, in front of the crowd, drank the contents of the bottle and resolved the situation on the spot.\n\nThe contents turned out to be beer.\n\nŌkawa sought protection for and relocated Koreans who had sought refuge in the police station and those taken into custody by vigilantes to Soujiji Temple. On September 3rd, the armed vigilantes surrounded Soujiji Temple and demanded the surrender of the Koreans. Ōkawa, fearing the potential killing of Koreans, decided to move them from Soujiji Temple to the Tsurumi Police Station. Concerned about the danger of refusing expulsion, Ōkawa stated that he would move them to the station and then send them far away, resolving the situation.\n\nUpon moving to the station, a crowd of vigilantes shouted to kill the Koreans, surrounding the station. Ōkawa attempted to persuade them, but the crowd clamored to crush the police supporting the Koreans. Local influential figures pressured for the expulsion of Koreans, and Tsurumi Police Station was surrounded by a crowd of over 1,000 people, with only about three officers present.\n\nŌkawa addressed the crowd, saying, “If you want to lay hands on the Koreans, go ahead and try. With all due respect, Tsuneji Okawa will take responsibility. Deal with it before me, and as long as we, the officers, have the strength, we won’t let a single one of you have your way.” (translated by Kelly)\n\nThe crowd was surprised by this, and after some discussion among representatives, they asked Okawa what responsibility he would take if the police couldn’t control the situation, and Koreans escaped. Okawa responded that in such a case, he would commit seppuku (ritual suicide) to apologize. Accepting his words, the crowd left, and approximately 300 people, including 220 Koreans and 70 Chinese, were protected by Ōkawa, the chief of Tsurumi Police Station, and other officers. Regarding the issue of food for the evacuees, Ōkawa faced criticism at a Tsurumi neighborhood meeting but managed to persuade them, and approval was obtained. The number of Koreans and Chinese increased to a total of 301, and on September 9th, they were all moved from Tsurumi Police Station to the “Kazan Maru” at Yokohama Port, safely resolving the situation.\n\nIn retrospect, Ōkawa later expressed surprise at his actions at that time, wondering if he still possessed such courage. He mentioned that while some believe that a person needs to perform extraordinary deeds in their lifetime, he personally did not consider it a special achievement but rather felt pleased to have gained an experience not easily obtained. A few years later, the Koreans sent a letter of gratitude.\n\nThe Unified Democratic Front of Koreans in Japan, an organization affiliated with the Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan), erected a monument in honor of Ōkawa at the entrance right of the main hall of Tokusanji Temple in 1953.\n\nWhen a grandson of Chief Ōkawa was invited to South Korea, he stated, “My grandfather, as a police chief, simply did what was naturally expected—protecting lives.”\n\nRelated News Coverage\n\nAsahi Shimbun, December 7, 2023 Koreans killed and injured during the Great Kanto Earthquake; Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno says, “No records found” https://www.asahi.com/sp/articles/ASRD762RMRD7UTIL01H.html\n\nMainichi Shimbun, December 13, 2023 New government document discovered supporting the massacre of Koreans during the Great Kanto Earthquake, created by the Army organization https://mainichi.jp/articles/20231213/k00/00m/010/124000c\n\nTBS Digital, August 29, 2023 Composition by a fifth-grade student who witnessed the massacre: “We threw Koreans into the river” – First-ever permission for photography 100 years after the Great Kanto Earthquake, depicting the tragic situation using only “hiragana”【news23】https://newsdig.tbs.co.jp/articles/-/688487\n\nTV Asahi, September 1, 2023 “Koreans Poisoning Wells” – Even now, 100 years later, the spread of “fake news” by the government and newspapers about the massacre during the Great Kanto Earthquake https://news.tv-asahi.co.jp/news_society/articles/000314167.html\n\nTokyo Shimbun, September 5, 2023 “145 Koreans Massacred” – Kanagawa Prefecture may report to the government, overturning the explanation of the government’s “no records” with a document created two months after the Great Kanto Earthquake https://www.tokyo-np.co.jp/article/274816\n\nReferences\n\n– Various historical materials from the Goryeo Museum\n\n角田房子.
