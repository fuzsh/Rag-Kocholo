        "text": "TOKYO -- The years 1953 and 1954 were filled with endless excitement for Donald Keene, who spent his days in Kyoto, the ancient capital where Japan's cultural traditions remain most distinctly. However, the young scholar was granted only one year to study at Kyoto University, while being enrolled at Britain's University of Cambridge. He had no time to waste. Keene did not confine himself to the university campus and set out ambitiously to absorb Japanese culture on the grand stage of Kyoto. He recorded the following in an autobiography:\n\n----------\n\nWhen I first arrived in Kyoto and was living near the Ryoan-ji, I (along with half a dozen small children) took lessons in calligraphy from a neighborhood teacher. After my move to Imakumano, I looked for another teacher. The nearest big temple was Chishaku-in, and I reasoned that this Shingon temple probably preserved the traditions of Kobo Daishi, the master of calligraphy. I arranged to take lessons there from a priest who was a renowned calligrapher, though of Sanskrit rather than Japanese writing. My handwriting certainly benefited by this practice, but even more important were the friends I made among the priests at the Chishaku-in.\n\n[On Familiar Terms]\n\n----------\n\nEven so, it is astonishing that Keene, a complete beginner, chose to learn calligraphy at the famous Chishaku-in Temple, the main home temple of the Chisan school of Shingon Buddhism. His model was the writings of calligraphy master Kobo Daishi, who was also the founder of the Shingon sect of Buddhism. This bold idea, which may not have occurred even to a typical Japanese person, is surprising, and the luck he had in encountering Buddhist priests who would accept it also sounds very typically Keene. In the summer of 2022, this reporter visited Chishaku-in Temple with Keene enthusiasts from Tokyo, as part of an event in Kyoto to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birth. Those at the temple today had also heard that a young Keene had frequented the place. A young priest commented, \"Back then, it must have been easier to approach and enter the temple than now. Something like public calligraphy lessons were also apparently held.\"\n\nKeene was fond of calligraphy until his final years, and he readily signed his books using his signature in katakana phonetic characters, and sometimes even his kanji signature. Keene, who's path into Eastern culture came through an interest in Chinese characters, loved kanji all through his life.\n\nBesides calligraphy, he apparently tried to venture into the world of \"shamisen,\" a banjolike three-stringed instrument, and \"kokyu,\" a bowed stringed instrument that looks like the shamisen's smaller cousin. Eventually, he set aside these musical instruments and dove into the world of \"kyogen\" traditional comic theater. Let's hear his excitement and passion at the time in his words below, as taken from his autobiography:\n\n----------\n\nMy greatest pleasure at this time was my kyogen (comic drama) lessons. It had occurred to me that I would understand Japanese culture better if I learned a traditional art. After thinking over the various possibilities, I chose kyogen. Although I had been deeply impressed by no, I was attracted by the language of kyogen and felt it would be more fun. When my landlady made inquiries about a kyogen teacher, the head of the Kyoto branch of the okura school, learning of my interest, decided to delegate his son, Shigeyama Sennojo, as the teacher of the first foreigner to study kyogen.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my weekly kyogen lessons. They took place in my house, which was so far removed from the neighbors that no one would be disturbed by the loud voices used in declaiming kyogen dialogue. My attempts to imitate Sennojo were a novel experience. Before this, my education had been through my eyes, but now I was learning entirely with my ears. Unlike my experience when I performed in high school plays and was urged to imagine I was a servant or a prince, I now had no need of imagination. It was incumbent on me to imitate Sennojo's voice as closely as possible. Only if one has become an accomplished kyogen actor is it permissible to \"break the mold.\" In fact, far from inhibiting me, the insistence on imitating my teacher gave me pleasure. I felt as if I had found a place at the end of a long line of predecessors.\n\nOccasionally the lessons took place elsewhere. I felt self-conscious in my haori and hakama (traditional Japanese male attire) when I left the house, resolved not to notice if people stared at me. On one occasion a group of young men jogging stopped in their tracks to stare in astonishment. But I soon realized that if I disliked being stared at, I had no business taking up a performing art.\n\nThe height of my short career as a kyogenshi was as Tarokaja in Chidori at the Kita Nogakudo on September 13, 1956. The role of the owner of the sake shop was taken by Takechi Tetsuji, known especially for his \"Takechi Kabuki.\" A video about five minutes long survives of part of the performance. (At the time video film was extremely expensive and was used parsimoniously.) When I see it now I can hardly believe I am the person delivering the lines, gesturing, jumping up and down, and finally exiting to the words onma ga mairu (His Excellency's horse is on the way). Even more unbelievable is the audience visible in the video, including Tanizaki Jun'ichiro, Kawabata Yasunari, Mishima Yukio, Matsumoto Koshiro, and other famous people. It was my only triumph on the stage.\n\n[Chronicles of My Life: An American in the Heart of Japan]\n\n----------\n\nThis 1956 performance took place on a return visit to Japan from the U.S., where he'd returned following his studies in Kyoto, which in the end lasted two years rather than the scheduled one. The names of those in the audience are certainly eye-drawing, including literary giants Junichiro Tanizaki, Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima, as well as kabuki actor Koshiro Matsumoto. It must have been an unforgettably proud moment for the young Keene. I'd like to introduce his friendships with these authors later.\n\nA foreigner taking up kyogen must have been rare in Kyoto back then. A while after he began training, Keene was mentioned in the Mainichi Shimbun's Osaka edition on Feb. 18, 1954. The headline roughly translates to \"Blue-eyed Tarokaja: U.S. expert studying in Japan learns kyogen.\" The story illustrated Keene's lessons with Sennojo Shigeyama, and was the first time the American scholar appeared in a Japanese newspaper. Below is his account of the time.\n\n----------\n\nIn 1953 there were so few foreign students in Kyoto that the newspapers considered us to be worthy of special attention. I was interviewed by reporters from the Kyoto offices of various newspapers, usually on such boring subjects as whether or not I could eat Japanese food or whether or not I slept on a futon. One reporter referred to me in his article as the \"blue-eyed Tarokaja\" (the name of the comic servant in the Kyogen I was studying) and this nickname remained with me for some years. My eyes have never been blue, but at that time some Japanese believed that all foreigners had blue eyes and red hair. At first I protested that my eyes were not blue, but in the end I accepted the nickname and even used it for the title of the first book I published in Japanese.\n\n[On Familiar Terms]\n\n----------\n\nAs someone who has met him many times, I can vouch that no matter what angle they were viewed from, his eyes were not blue, but dark hazel. The stereotypical view that Westerners have blue eyes must have been prevalent in the 1950s. Nonetheless, Keene chose \"Blue-eyed Tarokaja\" as the title of his first Japanese book after coming to Japan, which compiled magazine essays he wrote at the time.\n\nThough Keene loved the Noh play Matsukaze (Wind in the Pines), tearfully praising it as the epitome of beautiful Japanese language, he favored kyogen over Noh when it came to actual acting. The traditional performing art of Kyogen seems to have been the perfect match for Keene, who was always overflowing with humor.\n\n* * *\n\nThis series navigates the past century on the 100th anniversary of Donald Keene's birth -- also the centennial of The Mainichi -- by following the life of the late scholar, who contributed to the elevation of Japanese culture and literature in the world.\n\n(This is Part 21 of a series. The next \"Donald Keene's Japan\" story will be published on Jan. 3.)\n\n(Japanese original by Tadahiko Mori, The Mainichi Staff Writer and Donald Keene Memorial Foundation director)\n\nThe original text of Donald Keene's autobiographies is used with permission from the Donald Keene Memorial Foundation.
