Thanks go to Films, Inc., New Yorker Films, Audie Bock of East-West Classics, and Michael Jeck of R5/S8 Presents for making prints available for study. One of the challenges in the age of video is in being able to see anamorphic wide-screen films in their proper format. Since many of Kurosawa's films use an anamorphic wide-screen format, it was essential to study them as they were meant to be seen. Audie Bock generously shared her extensive knowledge of Kurosawa in several lengthy conversations. Kyoko Hirano spoke with me about Kurosawa's relationship with the American Occupation authorities and with the younger generations of Japanese directors. She also graciously furnished an unpublished paper for me to study. Leonard Schrader spoke with me about Kurosawa's career and work. A very special thank you goes to Michael Jeck, who read an early version of the manuscript, shared his boundless passion for Kurosawa with me in many conversations, and furnished some of the photographs that appear in the book. Other photographic materials are used courtesy of the Museum of Modern Art/Film Stills Archive. Quotations from Kurosawa's Something Like an Autobiography are used with permission of Alfred A.

Donald Richie's ground-breaking work on Japanese cinema and on Kurosawa has helped establish many of the paradigms through which that country's cinema is viewed. The importance of his contributions to the field and to the study of Kurosawa cannot be overstated. Indeed, when one thinks of Kurosawa in this country, one also thinks of Richie. Joanna Hitchcock, my editor, liked the idea for the book from the beginning. She carefully and patiently saw the project through to completion. Thanks also to Cathie Brettschneider for an exceptionally careful editing of the manuscript. My colleagues in the Department of Communication Studies at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University helped by making that an exciting and rewarding place to work and study. A special thank you goes to Carole Cavanaugh and Dennis Washburn, who organized and hosted \"Wording the Image,\" a 1997 symposium on Japanese literature and film. My participation in that conference gave me the first opportunity to think systematically about the issues explored in Chapter Eight. I'd also like to acknowledge Kristen Thompson and David Bordwell's use of the term \"axial cutting\" in relation to Kurosawa's work. I have employed this term as the label for an important feature of Kurosawa's cinematography and editing.\n\nIntroduction Akira Kurosawa has been called Japan's greatest living film director. In the West, he is the best-known Japanese filmmaker, and works like Seven Samurai and Yojimbo have retained a consistent popularity both in Japan and abroad. They have, moreover, greatly influenced Western filmmaking, from genres such as the Western to directors like Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah. Kurosawa's career has been a long and prolific one, and it stretches from the chaos of war-torn Japan to the present day and has ranged from contemporary films (Drunken Angel, The Bad Sleep Well) to period works (Sanjuro, Kagemusha, Ran), from works based on Japanese literature {Sanshiro Sugata, Rashomon) as well as foreign sources (The Idiot, Throne of Blood, High and Low), from exercises in established genres [Stray Dog, The Hidden Fortress) to inventions of new genres {Rashomon). But Kurosawa's eclectic tastes are unified by his consistent concern that his works be popular, that they move and excite a large audience. This they have done, uniting a seriousness of purpose with an ability to command the affection of a mass audience. That audience is now a global one. After a series of films seen only by the Japanese, Kurosawa made Rashomon, the film that was largely responsible for igniting Western interest in the Japanese cinema. His extraordinary reception by the West enlarged his stature as a major filmmaker but, ironically, has perhaps helped limit discussion of his work. Many of Kurosawa's films, such as Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, have been repeatedly screened, and his handling of action, his fast cutting, his affection for detectives, doctors, and samurai as characters—all have endeared him to Western audiences and have helped make his work comprehensible in relation to Hollywood movies, especially if gunfighters are imaginatively substituted for samurai. The popularity of Kurosawa's work, and the length of his career, has\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nhelped make his films seem perhaps too familiar, especially if one feels that he has been largely influenced by Hollywood productions. So popular a filmmaker, one whose work is so frequently revived, can become established as a fixed icon of popular culture. Such continual exposure can, paradoxically, prevent a closer look. Certainly it is paradoxical that a director of Kurosawa's stature has been infrequently studied. First published more than twenty-five years ago, Donald Richie's The Films of Akira Kurosawa has remained the only full-length Englishlanguage study of Kurosawa's entire body of work. There may be another reason for this comparative neglect besides Kurosawa's popularity. In his book on the director's samurai films, David Desser points out that the interests of film scholars studying the Japanese cinema have shifted away from Kurosawa to favor directors whose narrative and visual codes challenge and depart from the model of filmmaking established by Hollywood. \"Since the middle 1970s Kurosawa's cinema has been devalued in the sparse critical literature produced on the Japanese cinema. Kurosawa has been displaced, to all intents and purposes, by the so-called 'modernists' of the Japanese cinema, Ozu, Mizoguchi, and Oshima.\"1 The latter three filmmakers have been venerated by this shift of attention, and the study of their films has emphasized the extreme formalism, the visual experimentation and eccentricities of their style, while attempting to link that style with currents of popular and political culture.2 This emphasis is related to a major accomplishment of film studies in this period. Film scholars had long been fascinated with the Hollywood cinema, with its ability to efface its forms and to manufacture tightly stitched entertainments in which none of the seams showed. The patient studies of these scholars at last yielded a detailed and specific understanding of how Hollywood film operated.3 This accomplishment helped generate a renewed appreciation of, as well as a specific methodological context in which to situate, filmmakers like Ozu and Oshima who departed from Hollywood norms. The corollary has been the displacement of Kurosawa. Understanding the Hollywood cinema seemed to imply that Kurosawa, too, was a known quantity. Ozu, Mizoguchi, Oshima, now regarded as modernists and exemplars of an alternate filmic tradition, triumphed over Kurosawa, whose style never constituted the kind of rejection of narrative or genre that their work exemplified. We have, therefore, few extended, detailed considerations of Kurosawa's visual and narrative structures that draw from the contemporary insights of film studies. Noel Burch's analysis is an exception, notable\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nfor its close attention to the forms of the films, but the attention tends to be selective.4 Burch attempts to recoup Kurosawa within the modernist ground occupied by Oshima and others, and this leads him to emphasize such films as Throne of Blood and Ikiru at the expense of others. In addition, Burch develops a strictly formal explication of Kurosawa's work at the expense of thematic issues. In his study of Kurosawa's samurai films, Desser begins to rectify this neglect. He remarks that much yet remains to be explored in Kurosawa's cinema, and he offers his study \"in the spirit of inspiration, as a place to begin.\"5 Desser perceptively recognizes Kurosawa as a \"dialectical\" filmmaker operating \"to create works of narrative brilliance which reveal their own tensions,\"6 and he points to the need for an expansive and comprehensive treatment of Kurosawa's work that will explicate the significance of the extraordinary tensions within the films. \"In-depth studies of his oeuvre must reveal the significance of his patterns, not just their appearance. . . . Further studies must show how certain narrative patterns, character traits and formal means can be used most appropriately in certain kinds offilms.\"7Desser recognizes, as have other writers, that Kurosawa's cinema is a turbulent one, beset by tensions between premodern and modern values, between Eastern and Western traditions, and, stylistically, between flashes of extreme violence and moments of quiet and contemplation. Kurosawa's continual alternation of period with modern-dress films has also been remarked on by commentators.8 But an appreciation of the organic nature of these tensions throughout the entire body of work has not yet been attempted. How are the competing Eastern and Western values within his films linked to visual and narrative structures? How may we reconcile the apparently disparate aesthetic traditions represented by montage and the long take in Kurosawa's work? Of what are the oscillations between period and moderndress films a symptom? And what are the relations among the issues that these questions address? Above all, it is necessary to emphasize Kurosawa's work as a project, as a specific undertaking influenced by an immediate social challenge (i.e., the cataclysm of the second world war and the general cultural upheavals that it precipitated). These events are of central importance to Kurosawa's cinema, where they are revealed, transformed, in and by visual form and narrative style. What has not been extensively studied as yet are Kurosawa's most distinctive features of visual style and the specific kind of cinematic space they help create. His understanding of cinematic space is unique in film history, and it is a direct function of his method of choreographing on-\n\nXVIII\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nscreen movement, of his reliance upon the telephoto lens and techniques of multicamera filming, and, in the later films, of his use of the anamorphic frame. These choices of movement, lenses, and framing not only give the films their distinctive look hut also have a direct, if subtle, bearing upon the cultural project they announce. The mediations and connections between Kurosawa's visual form and the cultural circumstances that contextualize the work are fascinating to trace. The forms of his films are charged with ideological value—indeed, are set in motion by a specific ideological commitment—and the visual and narrative codes must be grasped as the material transformation of urgent social questions. The forms of Kurosawa's films will be studied closely, then, because they represent, in Rudolf Arnheim's terms, a kind of visual thinking. Kurosawa's reluctance to verbalize about the meaning of his films is well known. He has always insisted that his meanings are there, in the films themselves, and that people should watch them. We will take him at his word. Our primary evidence will lie in the material of the films, yet throughout the following chapters I shall also draw upon Kurosawa's autobiography as a parallel text to the films themselves. This is not intended as a rhetorical maneuver to seal my arguments by resort to a theory of origins. Indeed, as I will discuss later, the most fascinating thing about Kurosawa's autobiography is the extent to which it, too, can be viewed as one of his film narratives. Its chronicle presents Kurosawa as a Kurosawa character and the story of his life as the kind of spiritual odyssey witnessed so often in his films. The autobiography will be placed alongside the films, as one text among others. Yet it is distinct in possessing much valuable evidence on Kurosawa's attitudes, values, and sensibility. These are important to understand, not so that the films may be reduced to a biography, but so that the structures which inform them may be grasped. With Kurosawa and his work, we must employ a multiplex perspective because we are dealing with manifold levels of transformation: cultural, individual, cinematic. Even though his curious autobiography serves to establish him as yet another text, it is essential to understand the terms of his self-portrait so that we may establish a pathway from Meiji, Taisho, and Showa-era Japan into the material of the films. Kurosawa has directed thirty films (including his last, Madadayo), a large number for a study of this kind. Rather than approaching the films chronologically and considering each in turn, I have chosen to group them topically, arranging them according to particular formal or cultural\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nissues that they address. This method will emphasize both the diversity of Kurosawa's work and the logic of its internal development, the social and aesthetic problems around which it is organized, to which it continually returns, and for which it seeks resolutions. Each chapter has its own focus, yet they are all organized with reference to the central problematic of Kurosawa's work, which is to find a method for constructing a viable political cinema that is, at the same time, popular. The chapters trace Kurosawa's effort to use film politically, the genesis of this attempt and the context in which it developed, its maturation and evolution, and its eventual defeat. Thus, though each chapter is concerned with a single general issue, taken together they attempt to reveal the structuring dynamics of Kurosawa's cinema. Chapter 1 begins with the general context of Kurosawa criticism, considered through a review of some of its features, specifically, Kurosawa's reputation as a humanist and as a director influenced by the American cinema. I then outline the approach of this study by considering Kurosawa's work as part of a generational response to the tensions and strains of cultural modernization and democratization. In Chapter 2,1 discuss the development of Kurosawa's visual and narrative style in the early films. Sanshiro Sugata Parts I and II, The Most Beautiful, and They Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail are examined for what they tell us of Kurosawa's understanding of framing, editing, and the choreography of camera and object movement. The hallmarks of his style emerge very early and are organized in ways that frustrate attempts to establish dominant lines of influence from other filmmakers. Whereas Chapter 2 deals with issues of form and Kurosawa's understanding of the visual image, Chapter 3 focuses on the collision of those forms with the urgent problems arising in the aftermath of World War II. Kurosawa's films of the postwar years—No Regrets for Our Youth, One Wonderful Sunday, Drunken Angel, The Quiet Duel, Stray Dog, Scandal, and Ikiru—attempt to participate in the tasks of postwar reconstruction. It is within this context that his conception of a political cinema is forged. These films directly engage the milieu of social and economic collapse and attempt to specify the terms of the new individual required by a new world. These works initiate what I call the heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema, those films that hinge their political analysis on the exploits of an extraordinary individual. Chapter 4, in many ways, represents the transition to Chapters 5,6, and 7. It considers the appearance in Kurosawa's work of a tone and outlook that are counter to the heroic mode. This outlook first surfaces in the\n\nXIX\n\nXX\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nfilms he adapted from literature, and this chapter accordingly seeks to understand how the literary adaptation has functioned for Kurosawa. These adaptations are exercises in aesthetic experimentation as well as attempts to expand the boundaries of his cinema by considering the relationships between verbal and visual signifiers. Kurosawa comes to demonstrate a profound understanding of the differences between the literary and the cinematic modes, and the early acts of translation— Rashomon, The Idiot—are superseded by acts of transposition—Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths—in which the literary and the cinematic modes are no longer assumed to be equivalent. Three of these films are adapted from foreign literary sources, so the issue of cross-cultural borrowing may be explicitly posed with reference to Kurosawa. In addition, The Idiot will permit us to discuss one of the great unexamined topics in Kurosawa criticism, the relationship of Kurosawa's work to that of Dostoevsky. Kurosawa's fondness for Dostoevsky is well known, and an influence from the Russian master is often suggested by many writers, but it has never been closely explored. We will want to consider points of correspondence and divergence between these two artists. In Chapter 5,1 discuss Kurosawa's attempt in Record of a Living Being, The Bad Sleep Well, and High and Low to apply the visual and narrative structures developed in the immediate postwar years—structures that dramatized forms of heroic individualism—to systemic, transindividual social problems: the atomic bomb and the nuclear state, corporate corruption, class division and exploitation. Kurosawa attempted to use the old forms to deal with political issues of a new scale and scope. This examination re-poses the question of form, and the discussion will reconsider the nature of Kurosawa's style, especially in terms of its mature features: the use of telephoto lenses, multicamera filming, and the anamorphic frame. In Chapter 6,1 examine Kurosawa's use of the past in his period films, works whose aims and design are dialectically related to those of the modern-dress films. Desser notes that samurai films, like Westerns, work by transforming history into myth,9 and while we will have occasion to discuss this process in Kurosawa's work, it will be contextualized as a symptom of the strain and contradiction developing in his cinematic project. Moreover, his period films are not just examples of mythic storytelling. Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, and Red Beard announce a critical investigation of the past, of the relation between the individual and the social and cultural landscape. [The Hidden Fortress is briefly considered.) This investigation is conducted via a detour through the past, but it\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nis immensely relevant to Kurosawa's efforts to come to terms with contemporary Japan. His cinematic forms have always been marked by an extraordinary degree of internal tension, and these films reveal the profound source of that tension to lie in the threat posed by time and history to his cinematic project. Dodeskaden, released in 1970, was something of a shock for those who had closely followed Kurosawa's career. It looked like no other Kurosawa work, and the three films that followed—Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, and flan—announced a radically new aesthetic. In narrative structure, emotional tone, and visual style, these works initiate a break with the films that preceded them. But the apparent abruptness of the break is deceiving. What appears to be a stylistic cleavage is, instead, a culmination of the logic by which Kurosawa's formal structures had been developing in previous decades. In Chapter 7, I explore the complex relationship of these late works to the earlier films and their implications for the kind of cinema Kurosawa had attempted to construct. I explore Kurosawa's final works in Chapter 8 and discuss the altered terms through which his filmmaking now operated. The final films mark a distinctively different phase of his filmmaking, one that is virtually without precedent in cinema, i.e., a fully elaborated artistic late period. By living so long and remaining active as a filmmaker until nearly the end of his life, Kurosawa brought his cinema to a point of closure and conclusion, one rarely encountered in the world of cinema, where careers tend to be brief and filmmaking remains a young person's game. More than any other Japanese filmmaker, Kurosawa exerted a tremendous influence on world cinema, particularly on American films. In Chapter 9,1 explain why his films have been so influential and why, in some ways, the terms of this influence have distorted the work and minimized the complexity of his film style. This chapter assesses his place in cinema history, with particular reference to the generation of filmmakers who adopted his work as a template for their own. Kurosawa's works are extraordinarily important, not just for their singularly rich and complex formal structures, but for what they show us of the interrelations between form and culture, the artist and history. His attempt to fashion a cinema engaged with the contradictory demands of his time tells us much about the ideological nature of artistic form and about the place and the possibility of a committed aesthetic, its aspirations and its limitations. In the intersection of the imaginary vision with the material world, Kurosawa has taken his stand and has sought to\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nchange that world. The trajectory of this project forms one of the most compelling chapters in cinema history. I should end this introduction on a more personal note. This study has been very much a labor of love. When I was younger and just learning about the cinema, it was the films of Kurosawa that taught me the most about what movies were capable of. They had a visual energy, a passion and sheer love for moviemaking, that I had seen in few other filmmakers' work. Of course, when we are first encountering and falling in love with a medium, everything can be exciting. But Kurosawa's films have retained these qualities for me over the years, and I have tried to convey something of that in this study. Inevitably, there were some aspects of his work that I could not cover. I do not consider at length, for example, the extraordinary repertory company of actors that dominates the films. Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura are well known, and they do figure in the analysis that follows. But those who care for Kurosawa's work also know of the incomparable presence of Minoru Chiaki, Eijiro Tono, Daisuke Kato, Bokuzen Hidari, K6 Kimura, Seiji Miyaguchi, Eiko Miyoshi, Nobuo Nakamura, and, of course, the actor who embodied the first great heroes, Susumu Fujita. What I have closely studied, instead, are Kurosawa's images, his methods of constructing them, their organization and relation to his narrative structures. He has worked, and thought, through his forms. Through them, he has sought to engage his culture and his country, to map out the course of development he thought Japan needed. To understand Kurosawa, it is above all necessary to understand the nature of his images. Toward that end, this study is directed.\n\nWhen I initially wrote The Warrior's Camera, Kurosawa's career seemed essentially closed, with Ran his last grand statement as afilmmaker.But he kept working and went on into territory that virtually no other filmmaker has defined or explored. I am, therefore, especially grateful to now complete this study by examining the remarkable direction of Kurosawa's filmmaking after Ran. Now that his career has ended, it is clear that his work occupied four creative stages: the early films, the heroic works of postwar reconstruction, the transitional and pessimisticfilmsof 1970-85, and the psychobiography of the last films. The new chapters thus complete and bring closure to this study of Kurosawa's entire career. Writing them, though, had a special sadness. He lived while the bulk of the book was composed. This was no longer true for the new material, and the single hardest thing was writing about Kurosawa in the past tense.\n\nT H E\n\nW\n\nA\n\nR\n\nR\n\nI\n\nO\n\nR\n\n'\n\nS\n\nC A M E R A\n\n1\n\nViewing Kurosawa\n\nWithout knowing the unchanging, the foundation cannot be built, and without knowing the changing, style cannot be renewed. —Basho1\n\nIn the late 1960s, following a spectacularly successful career, Kurosawa faced the threat of its imminent disintegration. Plagued by ill health and no film work, in 1971 he slashed his wrists with a razor, aligning his personal despair with a recognized cultural practice of self-immolation. Yet this was a man who had never included a scene of ritual suicide in his films, a man whose regard for the worth and integrity of the self had always compelled his film characters to reject the codes of selfdestruction. Watanabe, the dying clerk of Ikiru, refuses suicide as the answer to his problems, reasoning that he cannot die yet because he does not know if his life has had meaning. Witnessing the horrible massacre of his retainers in Ran, the warrior Hidetora reaches for his sword to commit seppuku, but the scabbard is empty. Hidetora, too, is compelled to live. In a culture that emphasizes giri, or obligation, and ties of joint responsibility linking members of a group, Kurosawa has repeatedly broken with tradition to challenge the social determinants structuring the individual. Yet, during his most painful travail, he sought a solution he had never permitted his heroes. It was not quite the warrior's chosen end, opted for as a sign of fealty when the clan leaders were defeated in battle. But the attempt did resonate with a tradition possessing a certain cultural legitimacy. In this small contradiction lies an important clue to the nature of the films. To explore this contradiction is to define the shape and focus of this study. A convenient place to begin is with the dilemma Kurosawa faced in the 1970s, since in some ways it grew from the nature of his work. Since 1943, when he began directing, he had averaged at least a film a year, sometimes several annually. Occasionally, a year would lapse between releases, but in general he worked steadily and consistently. Following Red Beard in 1965, however, the work\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n1. Akira Kurosawa. (Museum of Modern Art/Film Stills Archive)\n\ndried up. Since then he has completed only five films, as compared to twenty-three in the first two decades of his career (excluding Those Who Make Tomorrow, a studio-compelled production co-directed with Kajiro Yamamoto and Hideo Sekigawa, for which Kurosawa has denied responsibility2). (Kurosawa's latest film, Dreams, consists of eight episodes based on memorable dreams extending back to his childhood. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were instrumental in helping the project get started. With George Lucas's help, Kurosawa tries modern special effects for the first time.3) The reasons for this sudden loss of work are generally, but insufficiently, understood as economic and sociological: the Japanese film industry was changing and had shut out directors like Kurosawa whose work it could not accommodate. Television arrived in the early 1950s, and, as in other countries, the audience and the motion picture industry changed forever. In 1953, according to Richie and Anderson, only 866 television sets operated in Japan, but by the late 1950s that number had greatly increased, nearing two million.4 By the mid-1960s, 60 percent of Japanese homes had television sets, and by the end of the decade, 95 percent of all households were tuned to the new medium.5 As in the\n\nE W I N G\n\nK U R O S A W A\n\nUnited States, popular acceptance of television was swift and unswerving. The audience stayed at home, and annual movie attendance sharply dropped from a high in 1958 of 1,127 million to under 200 million after 1975.6 Television also affected film content as the Japanese audience came to be divided into distinct groups of television viewers and cinema viewers.7 Kurosawa was recognized as a master of the period film, or jidaigeki, yet these films became a mainstay of television, where, as Anderson points out, their formulaic nature was easily accommodated to the demands of a weekly series: in 1982, more than a quarter of televised dramatic series were jidai-geki.8 Theatrical film responded by heavily promoting soft-core pornography, and the production firms themselves, like their counterparts in the United States, diversified into related leisuretime markets. Kurosawa, long established as one of the most expensively budgeted Japanese directors, found himself unemployable in the new cost-conscious climate of the late 1960s. Sweeping historical epics of the kind he often specialized in had become too expensive to produce for an industry that was scaling itself down both economically and artistically. The result, for Kurosawa, was a long, deep freeze, and his reputation suffered following an abortive involvement with 20th Century Fox's production of Tora! Tora! Tora!. Kurosawa claims to have quit the production, but other accounts suggest that he was fired because of a perfectionism some thought bordered on insanity.9 Dodeskaden (1970) was his response to the collapse of the Japanese industry and of his own reputation. \"I made this film partly to prove I wasn't insane; I further tested myself with a budget of less than $1 million and a shooting schedule of only 28 days.\"10 But the film also signals the beginning of a progressive, steadily deepening pessimism that has characterized all his subsequent works and that marks them as radically different from the earlier films. This change is not entirely explainable by the collapse of the Japanese film industry. Dodeskaden was not well received, and again Kurosawa's career languished. Unable to obtain funding for further projects in Japan, he accepted an offer from Mosfilm to work in Russia and used the opportunity to realize a project he had long cherished, a film of the diaries of the Russian explorer Vladimir Arseniev. Dersu Uzala (1975), however, was not the remedy for the long hiatuses plaguing Kurosawa's recent career. His next film, Kagemusha, would not appear until 1980, and Ran not until 1985, and both only as a result of financing obtained through international co-production.\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nKurosawa has not been silent through these vicissitudes. He accuses the industry of greed and timidity and argues that filmmakers must fight to regain artistic control of their projects: I feel that what's wrong with the Japanese film industry today is that the marketing side has taken over the decision-making power on what film is going to be made. There's no way that marketing-type people—at the level their brains are at—can understand what's going to be a good film and what isn't, and it's really a mistake to give them hegemony over all this. The film companies have become defensive. The only way to compete with television is to make real films. Until this situation is corrected, it's really going to be difficult for filmmakers in Japan.11 Compounding the economic problems Kurosawa began to face in the late 1960s was a shift in ideological film practice among newer Japanese directors. The questioning and politicizing of film form and of the role of the audience, which was so common at this time in the European cinema, also typified the work of such directors as Nagisa Oshima, Masahiro Shinoda, and the Japanese \"new wave.\"12 The Art Theater Guild, a small circuit of theaters, provided an outlet for their independent productions, and for a time radical filmmakers explored, expanded, and evaluated the codes and values of the traditional Japanese cinema, of Kurosawa's cinema.13 With Ozu and Mizoguchi gone, Kurosawa was condemned to be a symbol of reified tradition. In his commitment to linear narrative, his apparent lack of interest in Brechtian distancing devices, his refusal to develop a rigorous mode of political filmmaking, and his seeming inability to move beyond a method of social analysis centered on the individual, Kurosawa stood for the newer directors as the representative of all that was moribund and reactionary about the Japanese cinema. The denunciations of Kurosawa were often extreme and painful. Shinoda, for example, cast his criticisms of Kurosawa in terms of an explicit generational revolt: \"My generation has reacted against the simplistic humanism of Kurosawa in, for example, Rashomon, The Bad Sleep Well, and Red Beard. Kurosawa has also been resented by the younger people not only because they were looking for a new metaphysic, but also because he had the advantage of large sums of money to spend on his films and they did not. . . . Kurosawa has exhausted himself pursuing the traveling camera.\"14\n\nV\n\nI\n\nE\n\nW\n\nI\n\nN\n\nG\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nShuji Terayama described his relations to Kurosawa's work with greater equanimity but indicated that Kurosawa's kind of cinema was no longer compelling: \"At twenty-four I liked the work of Kurosawa very much. Now I don't hate it, but I felt pity when I saw Dodeskaden. Oshima and Shinoda say they hate Kurosawa, but I don't hate Akira Kurosawa.\"15 Eventually, the newer filmmakers would be caught in the same economic contradictions that Kurosawa faced, though for different reasons. With the collapse of a lively audience for motion pictures as well as the general formal and political retreat of the industry, it became harder for directors like Oshima to maintain the stylistic and political aggressiveness that typified their earlier work. Oshima has more recently described the contemporary industry with a disillusionment very close to Kurosawa's: \"Filmmaking here has become very hard since the 60s. In the 60s, there were students and other young people who were interested in seeing serious films. In the 70s, the film industry lost that audience, and the general public looked for entertainment in films rather than seriousness. In the 70s, the public stopped pursuing any idea of revolution. That has altered the industry significantly.\"16 As with Kurosawa, Oshima's political outlook has darkened at the same time the industry changed: \"In 1960, when I made Night and Fog in Japan, my hope was that the movements on the left would grow and strengthen. Now, as you can read in the newspapers today, only the worst has remained. The rest has vanished. Nothing has improved since the 1960s.\"17 It is ironic that Oshima, representative of the countercurrent to Kurosawa, should have found himself with similar problems (even to the necessity of seeking out international financing for his projects). But what both filmmakers were facing is the same: the decline of the auteur and the ascendancy of teams of producers and market researchers. Kurosawa, in particular, is the exemplar of an earlier mode of filmmaking that surfaced in the industrial countries following World War II. That mode has been termed the \"art\" film, and its practitioners—Kurosawa, Bergman, Fellini, Ray—caused a great deal of excitement in the film world of the 1950s. They helped make film an acceptable object of culture and study at a time when it was regarded much as television is today. In the halcyon days of Rashomon, Bicycle Thieves, La Strada, and The Seventh SeaJ, filmmaking became firmly established as an expression of national culture capable of international reception, and at the core of this new recognition stood a handful of directors. They were thrown forward by\n\ng\n\nC H A P T E R\n\ntheir era: authors functioning as codes legitimizing the seriousness of film and its identity, not as a machine or an industry, but as sensuous human expression, like the other arts. They were romantic times but exciting ones, and Kurosawa's contemporary plight symbolizes the final eclipse of this cinema, of the director as superstar. When he speaks, a nostalgia for those days is expressed. Describing earlier decades of the Japanese cinema, he says: It was the springtime of Japanese film-making. There was growth and optimism. The top management of the film companies were also film directors and they didn't try to restrict you for commercial reasons. But in the late 1950s and 1960s the climate changed: it was tragic when people like Mizoguchi, Ozu and Naruse all died—we began to lose our stand as directors and the companies took over the power. After that came the Dark Ages.18 Referring to the decline of the kind of director who made the art cinema possible—the \"auteur\"—Kurosawa has observed: \"In today's Japanese films, it would be possible to interchange titles, names of directors, without anyone noticing it. Anyone would be able to sign today's films. None is marked by the personality of the creator.\"19 When Kurosawa's moment of despair came in 1971, his desperation was triggered by loss of position in the industry and by the eclipse of the international art film (as well as by an undiagnosed illness). Yet there was another reason. The economic and sociological changes in the industry were external factors, impinging from without. But an internal crisis had developed within Kurosawa's work, a crisis of form in response to culture. It was not a new problem, but instead it had run through all the films as a kind of fault line, threatening always to rupture and split the work. Finally, it did. From his first film, Kurosawa had employed a particular mode of address for his Japanese audiences that preserved suspended in dialectical tension a mix of Eastern and Western values. As his career progressed, the particular mix of values would shift and alter, but always for Kurosawa the overriding importance was to use film to make history, to address the Japan shattered by World War II, and to help reshape its society. In the films of the late 1940s and early 1950s, from No Regrets for Our Youth to Ikiru, an extraordinary involvement with the contemporary social moment is manifest. This participation by the films in the specifics\n\nV\n\nI\n\nE\n\nW\n\nI\n\nN\n\nG\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nof postwar reconstruction dimmed in the later 1950s, when Japan had regained its economic and social bearings. But the urgency of Kurosawa's address in his role of moral leader continued unabated, particularly in his belief that social values, borrowed from the West, could be therapeutic additions to Japanese culture. This general project of addressing Japan by way of selective Western values reached its culminating expression in 1965's Red Beard, a film whose making exhausted Kurosawa both physically and philosophically. If a work as ambitious as Red Beard could have no effect on a society whose economic expansion, he believed, masked deeper social misery,20 then a life's work devoted to a belief that film could help make history would have to be revised, or else some other model of filmmaking would have to be found. In either case, a profound crisis in his art faced Kurosawa after Red Beard, and the long periods of inactivity and the very different form and tone of the later films testify that he has not yet solved this problem and never may. Thus, to lay the burden of Kurosawa's artistic problems exclusively on the greed or crassness of the contemporary industry is to miss seeing the very painful dead end, internal to the works, in which Kurosawa the filmmaker was stranded after 1965.1 will clarify this crisis and trace its development, but first a foundation for the analysis must be established. This may be done by considering some general features of our critical understanding of Kurosawa to see in what ways they might be extended. Because Kurosawa belonged to the tradition of the art cinema, the initial reception of his films was shaped by the influence of that tradition.21 Rashomon's exhibition at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 dramatically announced the talents of Kurosawa to an international community, and each film after that received a great deal of critical attention. The reception and discussion of these films during the rise of the international cinema in the 1960s was connected with the effort of film scholars to define the legitimacy of film criticism at a time when film studies was only just emerging as a field in the universities and was still regarded with suspicion and hostility. A close relationship exists, then, between the terms by which Kurosawa's films were understood and the needs of the discipline at that time. Consistency and harmony were stressed as the measures of artistic stature. It was, of course, the age of the auteur, when the greatest distinction a film could claim was its revelation of the \"signature\" of the author, the director. The films that were regarded as being most accomplished were those that revealed a creator's recognizable, coherent imprint. This standard of authorship was vitally important because it helped make\n\n•|Q\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nfilm like the other arts, not brute technology or a commodity, but an expression of culture fashioned by human design. The great filmmakers could be studied, as were the great painters and writers. A human presence could be disclosed within the machine. The critical work of revealing the auteur's presence implied a corollary: that the films themselves contain and communicate values of demonstrable social importance. Moreover, by revealing the latent meanings of a work, film criticism itself could help communicate these values and thereby establish its worth as an enterprise. Toward this end, a major code discerned within the films was the ideal of \"humanism.\" The films of Kurosawa and his peers—Rossellini, De Sica, Ray, Bergman—were praised for revealing the dignity of human life and a concern with human welfare. Anderson and Richie, in their history of Japanese film, wrote, \"This then is the famed 'humanism' of Kurosawa. He is concerned with the human lot above all else and he particularly insists upon the equality of human emotion. All of his films share this basic assumption.\"22 Charles Higham noted that Kurosawa believes in \"man's fundamental decency\" and that the director's is the \"tradition of humanism and optimism, of the courage of people who fight for goodness in the midst of a cynical world.\"23 Writing shortly after Rashomon had electrified the international film culture, Jay Leyda discerned that \"a high point is that element of Kurosawa's films that will keep them alive—their pity and humanity.\"24 Similarly, Vernon Young felt that, in his films, Kurosawa \"restores to man the quality which individualizes him.\"25 Norman Silverstein observed Kurosawa's \"Dostoevskian faith in man.\"26 David Robinson wrote of \"the essential human quality and human optimism\" of Dodeskaden.27 For Akira Iwasaki, Kurosawa is \"a humanist at heart.\"28 Audie Bock noted that Kurosawa may \"be counted among the postwar humanists.\"29 Keiko McDonald referred to Red Beard as \"the most humanistic\" of Kurosawa's films.30 Donald Richie observed that in Red Beard Kurosawa \"had vindicated his humanism and his compassion.\"31 While, as these scholars point out, Kurosawa's films are frequently marked by an extraordinary compassion for the suffering that they depict, what is curious and should also be noted are ways in which Kurosawa's cinema is not congruent with all the ideals that have been subsumed under the label \"humanism.\" Humanism is an elusive term, as it has been understood in a variety of contexts and applications. While it may sometimes be other than, or more than, the following attributes, it has sometimes been construed to include the values of restraint, decorum, balance, and proper proportion. Irving Babbitt, the American pro-\n\nE V V I N G\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nponent of humanism, wrote that a decorous manner, behavior that eschewed the excessive, was \"the central maxim\" of all genuine humanists.32 For Babbitt, humanists \"aim at proportionateness through a cultivation of the law of measure.\"33 Similarly, Norman Foerster considered restraint and self-control central to a humanist outlook.34 In contrast to a stress on correct balance, propriety, and good measure, Kurosawa does not emphasize these elements, either in terms of the portrayal of his characters or stylistically, at the level of visual form. As Noel Burch has pointed out, the keynote of the characters' behavior is the strange persistence and the wildness of their dedication to their goals, the single-mindedness and the consuming energy with which they pursue their ends.35 Richie has made a similar point, noting that \"the Kurosawa hero is distinguished by his perseverance, by his refusal to be defeated.\"36 The actor most closely identified with Kurosawa's films, Toshiro Mifune, exhibits very little in his screen excesses in the way of restraint and balance, and this is precisely why Kurosawa liked him. But these are trivial points. More important, Kurosawa's film style stresses the excessive, the transgressive, the flamboyant. As Akira Iwasaki has noted, in these films the \"very air is denser, the air pressure greater than in the atmosphere we normally breathe, sounds fall on the ear an octave higher than their usual pitch, and physical movements are speeded up or slowed down abnormally.\"37 The films \"are dramas of violent emotions, their traumatic effect heightened still further by exaggeration, emphasis, and extremes.\"38 Kurosawa himself has observed: \"I am the kind of person who works violently, throwing myself into it. I also like hot summers, cold winters, heavy rains and snows, and I think my pictures show this. I like extremes because I find them most alive.\"39 In their celebration of the extremities of human behavior, the staccato, jagged rhythms of their cutting, and the undermining of a stable visual world through decentered compositions and the foregrounding of character and camera movement, Kurosawa's films have more of the Dionysian about them than is perhaps consistent with a thoroughgoing humanism. Furthermore, as subsequent chapters show, Kurosawa's cinematic embrace of humanity is somewhat compromised by his affection for the codes of the samurai class and by the aesthetic form to which his affiliation with warrior culture has helped lead him: a continuing reliance on heroes, on the few for whom moral growth is portrayed as a possibility, as distinguished from the masses of people who are portrayed in film after film as afflicted by a kind of moral entropy, unable to live like a Watanabe, Kambei, or Niide.40 It is, therefore, perhaps better to speak of\n\n12\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n2. Kurosawa on location during the filming of Seven Samurai. K6 Kimura, as Katsushiro, is on the left. (Museum of Modern Art/Film Stills Archive)\n\na humanist impulse within the films, but one that is constrained by the ambiguities of a commitment to heroic narratives. (In his latest films, Kurosawa has moved away from a reliance on heroes, but he has become deeply pessimistic about any notion of human perfectibility.) In any event, as Desser has pointed out, the time has come to move beyond notions of humanism in explaining Kurosawa's work and to rely instead on close scrutiny of cinematic codes.41 In addition to exploring the commitment to human welfare in Kurosawa's films, another recurring focus of Kurosawa criticism has been upon the question of influence. Who influenced whom the most, Kurosawa or Hollywood? Kurosawa has frequently been described as the \"most Western\" of Japanese filmmakers, and many scholars have discerned stylistic similarities between his work and a range of Hollywood directors. While these have included George Stevens and Howard Hawks,42 very often comparisons are made with the work of John Ford. Both men were attracted to stories of masculine adventure (though, perhaps, Kurosawa more consistently than Ford); both men continued to\n\nV\n\nI\n\nE\n\nW\n\nI\n\nN\n\nG\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nrely on a stock company of trusted performers; and both men, of course, had a certain regard for Westerns. Kurosawa himself has been most gracious in acknowledging his affection for Ford's films and his respect for Ford the man. In his autobiography, he humbly says that, compared to Ford, he is no more than \"a little chick.\"43 Charles Higham suggested that Kurosawa learned \"his handling of mass action, of the complexities of location shooting, from Ford.\"44 Tom Milne found the redeeming values of Dersu UzaJa to be its Fordian qualities: \"Dersu Uzala is rescued from the reefs of sentimentality by direction as calmly matter-of-fact in its elegiacs as the best of John Ford.\"45 John Pym found the images of Kagemusha to be \"painterly . . . derivative of Kurosawa's revered Ford.\"46 John Gillett suggested that a composition from Kagemusha of warriors crossing the plains \"was not only exciting and beautiful but seemed to forge yet another link between the landscape painting of Kurosawa and Ford.\"47 Richie and Anderson found Takashi Shimura to be to Kurosawa \"what Ward Bond was to John Ford,\"48 and Richie finds Toshiro Mifune to be to Kurosawa \"what John Wayne was to John Ford.\"49 The town in Yojimbo, Richie also suggests, \"is very much like one of those god-forsaken places in the middle of nowhere remembered from the films of Ford.\"50 Of course, it is difficult to establish definitive lines of influence, and Kurosawa himself, while acknowledging his admiration for Ford, has indicated that he has avoided any conscious imitation of the American filmmaker. \"I'm sure that my films do show some influence from John Ford, whose work I like very much, but I'm certainly not conscious of doing anything to imitate him.\"51 Moreover, as I suggest in a later chapter, Kurosawa works from a rather different orientation to the past, to tradition, and to marriage and family than does Ford. One of the most productive lines of inquiry for understanding Kurosawa's cinema and its potential debt to, or influence upon, Hollywood has been the consideration of his relationship to the American Western. Many scholars have contributed to this debate by drawing comparisons between images or weaponry from Kurosawa's films and Westerns, by affirming that Kurosawa has been influenced by Westerns, or by using the Western as a kind of metaphorical category for describing Kurosawa's own films or patterns of imagery. In the latter case, an influence is not alleged so much as is the presence of strong, general similarities of narrative, image, or characterizaton. Kenneth Nolley reports that Kurosawa has been \"deeply influenced\" by American Westerns.52 Ralph Croizier suggests that in \"structure, mood, and basic values the similari-\n\n-| 3\n\n-|4\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nties might well appear more important than the differences between a six-gun and a samurai sword.\"53 Alain Silver compares the gunfighter's display of weaponry to that of the samurai.54 Nigel Andrews compares Sanjuro with True Grit and calls it \"the most autumnal of Kurosawa's Japanese Westerns.\"55 By contrast, David Desser finds that Sanjuro reveals the influence of Shane.56 Tom Milne compares Dersu UzaJa to Sidney Pollack's Jeremiah Johnson.57 Richard Combs found an evolution in Kurosawa's use of the genre. Writing of Kagemusha, he suggested that \"The modern weaponry of the enemy clans, and some scenes of slow motion death agony, might nevertheless suggest an updating of Kurosawa's Western imagery, from Ford to Peckinpah.\"58 (This suggestion, however, tends to reverse the direction of influence, since Kurosawa's use of slow motion for the depiction of violence in films as early as 1943 clearly predates its appearance in the American cinema in the late 1960s in such films as Bonnie and CJyde and The Wild Bunch.) Donald Richie cites Bad Day at Black Rock, Shane, and High Noon as models for Yojimbo.59 (In this case, it seems likely that Kurosawa has borrowed a small bit of business from High Noon—the sound of coffins being hammered.) Writing on the American film The Magnificent Seven, Joseph Anderson observed that \"Kurosawa's self-acknowledged debt to the American Western, particularly John Ford's, helped to determine the shape of The Seven Samurai. This foreign influence has nourished him.\"60 Anderson then adds that \"Without the American cinema, there would be no Kurosawa.\"61 In considering the relationship between Kurosawa's samurai films (and the samurai film in general) and American Westerns, David Desser points out that the \"obvious similarities of being set in the past, of having armed heroes who protect the weak or who seek bloody revenge, and the subscription to a codified set of behavioral norms like 'The Code of the West' or the code of 'Bushido,' give the two forms an obvious affinity,\" but he also cautions that the extent to which the samurai film is indebted to the Western \"is questionable.\"62 The differences between the two categories of film are as important as the apparent similarities. Desser, for example, discusses differing conceptions of the frontier and of nature in the two genres.63 Also stressing the differences, Stuart Kaminsky has observed that the samurai film \"deals with myth in a way which the American Westerns cannot attempt because of different national needs, conventions, and historical film traditions.\"64 Both types of film are about men of violence who are defined in terms of their weapons, yet the characters and stories are embedded in net-\n\nV\n\nI\n\nE\n\nW\n\nI\n\nN\n\nG\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nworks of different social structural values, which firmly separate the two classes of film. Each articulates a different response to history and culture. Class identity, relations, and conflict are all central to the samurai film while being quite peripheral to the Western, which is why Kurosawa's Seven Samurai does not really translate to an American context. Historically and socially, the gunfighter-peasant relationship is not the same as the samurai-farmer relationship. As Tadao Sato notes, unlike the samurai film, \"there is no distinction in the rank of characters who appear in Westerns. The sheriff, outlaw, cowboy, farmer, etc., are more or less on an equal social footing.\"65 The samurai belonged to a distinct space in the social hierarchy that marked him off from such other classes as the farmers or the aristocracy. During historical eras preceding the Tokugawa period, the class lines between samurai and farmer were far more fluid than they were after the seventeenth century, but in both eras the samurai as a class depended for their identity on the codes of obligation that bound them with their lord: the obligation to serve their lord in time of conflict, and the lord's obligation to reward their service with land or rice, which they depended upon for their existence. Many samurai films deal with samurai who are in the employ of their lords, and many others deal with the ronin, or unemployed, samurai; but in either case samurai behavior is clearly prescribed by custom and constrained by the class hierarchy. Even when a samurai had fallen from his respected position in society, an implicit comparison with the prescribed codes of the class might be made: much of the humor of Yojimbo and Sanjuro depends on the distance between Mifune's shaggy, dirty, selfinterested ronin and the warrior ideal.66 By contrast, the mythological appeal of the American West was precisely its supposed classlessness: it was the region where failed Easterners or oppressed Europeans could find the space and the opportunity to build a new society free of the political and economic corruptions of the old world. Drawing on this mythology, Westerns are implicit celebrations of the building of civilization, dramatizing a future full of promise and optimism (My Darling Clementine, Red River, Shane, Once Upon a Time in the West). Either that, or they dramatize the collapse of the myth, the closing of the land and of the opportunities that it promised (The Wild Runch, McCabe and Mrs. Miller). Westerns portray society as embodying the progressive unfolding of history, or they bitterly attack it for failing to do better. The logic of these portrayals depends on the gunfighter as a catalyst, a character free of ties to the past, obligated to no one, and thereby able to help usher in the golden future or, because of his\n\n^ IJ\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n\"pure\" isolation, able to bring down violently the old order. In either case, his actions are purifying and have an explicit social function. The gunfighter, because of his isolation, is able to exercise choice. He may have to ride off into the mountains at the end, as in Shane, but his decision to intervene in the action has historically progressive consequences. It may, for example, permit the safe growth of a town in a formerly violent region. Nihilism is rarely the Western's reply to history and society. By contrast, a nihilist response is a possibility for samurai films (or else the films will uncritically celebrate the glories of fulfilling samurai duty, as in the cycle of films about the loyal forty-seven ronin who stoically endured all sorts of indignities in order to avenge the honor of their lord) because the samurai's actions are ferociously constrained by giri, the social codes of obligation. In his discussion of subgenres of the samurai film, Desser points out that nihilism or fatalism suffuses several of these subgenres.67 Films like Kobayashi's Hara-Kiri and Samurai Rebellion rely \"heavily upon the juxtaposition of a trapped individual existing within a rigid social structure.\"68 These films by Kobayashi ruthlessly reduce the range of the samurai hero's choices until the only one left him is a lonely death, after which, in Hara-Kiri, his very existence is obliterated from the historical records. Peckinpah did something similar in The WiJd Bunch, foreclosing the options his outlaws faced, except that he allowed them to die fighting together, affirming the bonds of friendship, and, in the final images, he permitted them to live on in folklore and song.69 Only in Sergio Leone's Westerns, and in those he inspired, has a nihilist response been evident, but Leone derived his cycle of films from Japanese samurai films, specifically Kurosawa's Yojimbo. While Westerns celebrate in the gunfighter the isolationist and individualist components of American culture, the space for such an individual in medieval Japanese culture was far more problematic. The nihilism of a film like Hara-Kiri is the response to unyielding historical and cultural patterns. The gunfighter rides away at the end of Westerns because, to American culture, this is the essence of freedom: the ability to shed social ties and move on. The samurai hero has a harder time doing this. The codes of giri are everywhere and have constituted his identity. Thus, violence in samurai films (e.g., in Yojimbo or in Hara-Kiri) may be portrayed as impotent and futile. By contrast, Westerns define violence as necessary for social progress. Westerns and samurai films are structural expressions of differing cultural perceptions of what constitutes the social self. The gunfighter is\n\nE W I N G\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nskilled and pure in his isolation from society, while the samurai may be diminished or destroyed when attempting to escape the constraints of social obligation.70 Thus, Kurosawa cannot simply make Westerns, since the social perceptions and the national tradition that they express are quite foreign. He cannot simply translate them into a Japanese context, no more than John Sturges and his crew could translate Kurosawa's seven samurai into gunfighters. The generic codes of Westerns and samurai films do not freely circulate from one genre to the other. Instead, what Kurosawa has said about Westerns is quite different and instructive: \"Westerns have been done over and over again and in the process a kind of grammar has evolved. I have learned from this grammar of the Western.\"71 This statement is provocative. It indicates that what Kurosawa found useful in Westerns was not their content but certain syntactic features. Rather than borrowing at the level of content, rather than telling stories about gunfighters with swords, Kurosawa may have found the Western's syntax of movement and framing to be of value. The Western's ability to integrate figure and landscape in a long shot in ways that describe relations between humans and their environment, and its tendency to treat the landscape as a morally symbolic terrain such that the land itself becomes a character in the films, would certainly resonate in a culture like Japan's, where traditions of nature veneration are very old. Kurosawa's films partake of these traditions and treat the physical environment in a highly active way: rain and wind are passionate indices of human character in his work. The symbolic structure of such films as Rashomon and Red Beard is built around the weather and the seasons. This is quite consistent with Japanese aesthetic tradition, where each of the seasons had its own affective properties, where the performance of particular Noh plays was correlated with appropriate seasons, and where one of the rules of good haiku composition was that it contain a seasonal reference.72 In addition to the almost animistic treatment of landscape in the Western, the genre has another characteristic of relevance to Kurosawa. It takes as one of its subjects cinematic properties of movement. The narratives frequently assume the form of journeys, where travel by horse across the frame accentuates the boundaries of the screen, and in 'scope films the flatness of the image. By panning to follow a moving horseman, strongly lateral patterns of movement may be established. As we will see, Kurosawa displays in his work a profound affection for this type of\n\n18\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nmovement: lateral motion across the frame is one of the visual signatures of his cinema. But, in addition, Kurosawa is deeply interested in studying the variables of movement on screen, and much of his film style is comprehensible as an effort to emphasize the experience of kinesis. His favored choice of lenses of long focal length is particularly governed by this interest in emphasizing the dynamics of motion on screen. Kurosawa brings an almost analytic interest to bear on his organization of lenses, camera, and object movement, an interest in exploring the motion-enhancing capabilities of differing combinations of these elements. As a genre that exploits cinematic properties of motion and relates them to the coordinates of the frame, the Western is a compelling genre for Kurosawa to study. But this study has occurred primarily at the level of form, of \"grammar,\" and not of content. Kurosawa studied the Western as a visual form, much as he studied the prints of Hokusai and the paintings of Van Gogh, and he found sympathy with those elements that fit his own cultural experience and cinematic interests. In this he remained a thoroughly Japanese filmmaker. Kurosawa himself has made this point. \"I don't think I'm Western at all. I don't understand how I could have that reputation. I feel that among Japanese directors today I must be the most Japanese.\"73 In addition, there is ample evidence that Kurosawa has been at least as influential upon American Westerns (and American films) as they have been upon him. Obvious examples are John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven), Sam Peckinpah, and George Lucas.74 Though Sergio Leone is Italian, his visual style is strikingly indebted to Kurosawa (from the sinuously tracking camera to the use of wind and dust as visual signs of dramatic tension), and Kurosawa's influence found its way back to the American cinema by way of Leone. A Fistful of Dollars initiated a cycle of American Westerns modeled on their Italian cousins.75 (It is worth pointing out, however, that Leone would go on to transcend the Kurosawa influence. Once Upon a Time in the West is a magnificent creation and one of the best of all Westerns.) In summing up, then, an important point to make when considering the vexed and probably unanswerable question of which way the influences go between Kurosawa and the American cinema is that Kurosawa's cinematic references, the heritage that he has drawn from and enjoyed, are extraordinarily diverse. They include John Ford and Westerns but go considerably beyond these. For example, he has repeatedly cited the silent cinema as a source of inspiration:\n\nE W I N G\n\nK U R O S A W A\n\n3. The influence of Kurosawa: direct remakes as in The Magnificent Seven (1960), freely adapted from Seven Samurai. (Museum of Modern Art/Film Stills Archive)\n\nfrequently, in conversation, people have pointed out to me that a particular scene in one of my films reminds them of something as far back as the silent film era. When I'm told this, I suddenly realize that it may be true, because I've seen many films that I admired very much—and the ones I like stay with me in my subconscious and perhaps I have some kind of impulse to recreate the same impression when I make my own films.76 I like silent pictures and always have. They are often so much more beautiful than sound pictures are. Perhaps they have to be.77 Moreover, Kurosawa indicates that his cinematic tastes (and debts) range globally. In the autobiography, he lists close to 100 films that impressed him during his youth and adolescence, and it is a very eclectic list, ranging from works by Griffith, Chaplin, and Stroheim to works by\n\n19\n\n20\n\n4. and 5.

Given Kurosawa's fondness for the moving camera, Murnau, not surprisingly, figures in the references. More important, so does Sergei Eisenstein. Not only would Kurosawa include an homage to The Battleship Potemkin in The Hidden Fortress (the spectacular massing of the crowd on the castle stairs), but much of his work may be regarded as an attempt to work out and extend the implications of Eisenstein's theory and practice of montage. Noel Burch has noticed this and written that Kurosawa \"may be regarded as the direct heir of Eisenstein in so far as he returned the shot-change to its true function as a visible, avowed parameter of filmic discourse.\"78 A quick glance at these references clearly indicates the richness of the cinematic culture from which Kurosawa has been nourished.79 Kurosawa has never exhibited any of the \"anxiety of influence\" that one would expect from a filmmaker conscious of working from the forms and traditions of another. Instead, he very quickly found his own voice in film and displayed his own stylistic synthesis of fluid camera movement and montage cutting. With these considerations in mind, then, how might Kurosawa's work be contextualized? What are the issues that it addresses? How may his style be accounted for in all its contradictions, its tempestuousness and passion, as a response to Japan and the Japanese, for whom Kurosawa has said he really makes his movies? Kurosawa himself has provided clues. He has spoken of the peculiarities of the era that was formative for him and his generation: In the Edo period Japan was a very closed society; then in the Meiji era everything came rushing in from abroad at an incredible rate. We all tried to absorb this as quickly as possible—western literature, painting, music, art. So it's all part of my make-up and comes to the surface very naturally.80 as I was growing up, my education—as that of most people of my generation—compared to younger people today, covered a broader span: Shakespeare, Balzac, Russian literature. It's quite natural that my education would manifest itself later in my work.81 Kurosawa was born in 1910, and his life spans the tail end of the Meiji period, the era of interwar social protest, the war years of intense nationalism and anti-Westernism, and Japan's postwar period of rapid eco-\n\n2 1\n\n22\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nnomic growth. His life, therefore, is virtually consonant with twentiethcentury Japanese history. Moreover, these were periods that posed questions about Japanese identity in especially acute terms. Born at the very end of the Meiji period, Kurosawa would, in his art, grapple with the fundamental challenge posed by this period: the relation between Japan and the West, specifically the tensions between Japanese cultural identity and economic and political modernization. For the Meiji period (1868-1912) saw Japan embarking on an ambitious program of social, economic, and political development. This was presaged by a challenge from the West in the form of Admiral Perry's gunboats. Japan's answer was a program of rapid modernization coupled with explicit study and borrowing from the West. From a parliamentary government replete with a constitution, to telephone and train lines, a postal service, and developing industrial capacities, the accoutrements of the modern Western world were swiftly adopted. But such a program could not be separated from a sometimes powerful anxiety about whether Japan would cease to be Japan. In an account of the travels of the Iwakura embassy, Eugene Soviak remarks that the problem confronting the Meiji modernizers was the dilemma of whether it was possible \"to transplant Western industry and technology without adopting the whole socio-political structure and value system of the West.\"82 John Whitney Hall has pointed out that among the challenges posed by modernism for those Japanese living through the changes was a dilemma of meaning. Because of a historical congruence between modernization and Westernization, sensitive Japanese were led to a project of studying the West in an effort to fathom its \"meaning\" and the secrets of its development and apparent civilization (though to other Japanese, the Westerners were simply barbarians). \"The assumption that modernization in Japan was equivalent to Westernization has tended to direct the search for [the] definition of modernization among Japanese toward the task of finding 'meaning' in Western civilization.\"83 Modernism posed a \"problem of meaning\" for many Japanese passing through its swiftly moving currents.84 There were fears that Japan would lose its identity in a \"flood of Westernization,\" and in some quarters there was a backlash against Western culture by the 1880s.85 Carol Gluck quotes an editorial by Katsunan Kuga in the late Meiji period that is indicative of these fears: \"not only is our national autonomy impaired but foreign influence threatens to rush in and buffet our island country about until our manners and customs, our institutions and civilization, our historical spirit, even our national spirit are swept away.\"86\n\nE V V I N G\n\nK U R O S A W A\n\nSeveral scholars have suggested that generational differences prevailed among the responses of Japanese to the force of the new and the novelty of the West.87 In his account of Japan's early student radicals, Henry DeWitt Smith suggests that, after 1868, young Japanese displayed shifting commitments to issues of national integrity and strength, to a fascination with self-centered introspection or, by the 1920s, to a concern for social problems that led many to Marxism.88 In a discussion of the historian Saburo Ienaga, Robert Bellah points to Ienaga's perception of generational differences in the responses to the new changes in Japan. \"[T]he generation of the great enlighteners grew up in Tokugawa times. Those men all came to know who they were when the traditional order was intact.\" For the next generation, however, \"modernization implied the 'spiritual breakdown' which [the novelist] Natsume Soseki spoke of as following the impact of Western culture.\"89 Whether, and to what extent, historical vicissitudes are realized in recognizably distinct personality types is probably an unresolvable issue. The salient point, however, is that for some Japanese the changes that beset the nation during and after the Meiji period could be experienced in intensely personal, existential terms. This period did not have to be, in actuality, historically discontinuous with preceding eras to be experienced as such. In a discussion of Japan's apparently radical political and social realignment during the Allied Occupation following World War II, Robert Ward points to the Meiji era as a time that appears similarly discontinuous with what preceded it. \"These seem to be years when enormous and highly discontinuous changes of an institutional and behavioral sort are compressed into very short periods of historical time.\"90 But, contra Foucault, he cautions against overvaluing the discontinuous in history, maintaining that in both cases—Meiji Japan and the Occupation years—what seems so novel was in many cases prepared for by the developments of earlier eras. \"In the light of recent scholarship the Restoration has not turned out to represent so abrupt a break with the institutions, values, and behavior of the past . . . history affords few, if any, examples of real watersheds of that sort.\"91 Marius Jansen and other scholars have pointed out that the Meiji leaders were enacting a dynamic of change that had its roots in the Tokugawa era and earlier.92 The diachronic view available to the historian, however, may not be the same as the necessarily limited synchronic perspective of the in dividual subject to, and living out, a specific history. Jansen points out that the problem of cultural reintegration, which followed in the wake of\n\n2 3\n\n24\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nmodernity, \"was seen less as one of modern vs. tradition, as it was in the West, than of modern vs. Japan; a generation that asked itself whether it was Japanese or modern, Japanese or Christian, experienced a special kind of loneliness and uncertainty.\"93 Kurosawa's remarks quoted earlier, about how natural a part of his character is the coexistence of East and West, would seem to belie what has just been suggested about the individual's experience of apparently sudden historical change. If one looks at the films and reconstructs their signs, however, rather than focusing on Kurosawa's claims about his own personality, then abundant evidence emerges of an aesthetic sensibility that prizes discontinuity, shock, and the apocalyptic. Kurosawa's generation was one for which the West contained special meaning, and if he has negotiated in his personal life a harmony between East and West, the films tell a different story. There, narratives abound of social collapse, of psychic crisis, of worlds shaken to bits by social, cultural, and economic conflicts. As Keiko McDonald has noted, Kurosawa's films \"begin with an acute awareness of a fragmented world.\"94 Throughout it all—in the form of jazz, neon lights, nightclubs, striptease shows, and, in the period films, the deadly firearms—the shadow of the West and the signs of its impact are everywhere and are viewed with an ambivalence that is profound and constitutes the motor of the narratives. John Whitney Hall has remarked that, in searching for the meaning of the West, each generation of Japanese laboring under its impact has had differing sensitivities about the significance of Western culture.95 As Japan itself changed and developed, \"Western culture\" acted as a multidimensional category, a dynamic, multivalent signifier. Herbert Passin pointed out that it never signified only one range of meaning but was shifting through the varying perceptions of differing observers and generations, constructed and reconstructed as a social category to suit \"felt needs\": If it is never the same \"Japan\" in contact with the West, neither is it the same West. \"The West\" is not and has never been univocal. It has always offered a range. Sometimes the West has meant liberalism and individualism, sometimes German conservative philosophy;. . . What ultimately comes to be selected depends upon an intricate dialectic between felt needs at particular times, what was available in the West, and the particular West to which people were responding.96\n\nV I E W I N G\n\nK U R O S A W A\n\nEngaged in a generational search for meaning, carried out through his aesthetic forms, Kurosawa would come to construct the West in his own manner: visually, by defining a particular stylistic relationship with the Hollywood cinema; narratively, by shaping plot so that social crises are portrayed as opening up a range of choice to, and thereby defining, the autonomous individual; and socially, by borrowing ideals of individualism and economic democracy from Western social thought and the reforms of the Occupation. In responding to the challenge of meaning posed by the West, and in constructing a version of the West as well as of \"Japaneseness,\" Kurosawa was certainly not alone. Shuichi Kato has described such Japanese novelists as Mori Ogai and Natsume Soseki as \"creators from cultural confrontation,\"97 transforming the impact of East and West into a creative force, while, in his essays on Soseki and Kafu Nagai, Donald Keene has pointed to the importance of their ambivalence in choosing between East and West, and to occasional revisions of choice, as a tension fueling aesthetic form.98 More recently, David Bordwell has suggested that Ozu's films can be viewed as reflections of and meditations upon \"the broken promises of Meiji,\" that is, the notion \"that Japan could modernize without suffering a dislocation of what were defined as its central traditions.\"99 Like the work of these other artists, Kurosawa's cinema addresses the themes of modernity in the Japanese experience. His films convert them into felt challenges of individual conscience by telling stories of strong protagonists grappling with the social ills of a developing nation and the modern order: poverty, disease, industrial and political corruption, fear of the bomb. As Jansen has pointed out, these dilemmas \"combine to make more complex the search for autonomy of personality and freedom of choice.\"100 Kurosawa's cinema is powerfully resonant because it clarifies the stakes of this search and so directly, and poignantly, exhibits the probability of its failure. Considering possible relationships between an artist's chosen style and a given historical moment, Shuichi Kato has remarked that style ought to be understood as an emblem of the artist's times.101 Also concerned with the social grounding of aesthetic forms, the film scholar Tadao Sato has noted that the cinema is especially sensitive to the crosscurrents of an era: \"Japan had cast off feudalism to embrace modernism with such haste and vigor that repercussions of the battle between old and new were being felt at all levels of society. However, as the movements in the film world have been the most active and\n\n2 5\n\n25\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nlively, it is through film that we will witness the clearest tremors of that battle.\"102 Indeed, in Kurosawa's films we witness tremors of great magnitude that have one of their roots in anxieties about the dynamics of social change, anxieties left as a legacy of Meiji and which continued to be felt throughout the succeeding Taisho era.103 Would a program of development necessarily unleash an uncontrollable cultural process that would forever transform the tiny island nation? Gluck maintains that \"the late Meiji rendition of modernity\" as a potentially negative and divisive condition, threatening to established traditions and social orders (e.g., breeding labor unrest, threatening the peasantry's ties to the land) \"was, until 1945, the authoritative one.\"104 George Wilson, discussing the crisis atmosphere that prevailed among political circles in the 1930s, points to a fear that, as was perceived to have happened during the Meiji Restoration, social conflict and change, once let loose, could potentially sweep the state away and realign the course of Japan's development.105 A caveat is in order. Development has a dark side, yet Japan has been remarkably successful in charting and realizing a course of rapid social and economic development, and many scholars have pointed with pride to the nation's accomplishments in creating a reasonably democratic state capable of responding to redress social injustice and the grievances of its citizens.106 Nevertheless, while recognition of Japan's very real social and economic successes is in order, when studying the films of Kurosawa, it is necessary to point to the ambiguous legacy of modernization. Jansen suggests that along with an abundance of material goods and an improvement in living standards come other developments that are not strictly directed toward \"progress in the sense of better and happier lives. . . . Violence, uneasiness, and unhappiness have everywhere been the companions of modernization processes. Everywhere there is a consciousness of a loss of values, a search for reintegration with new groups.\"107 Kurosawa's cinema is extraordinarily responsive to these ambiguities of development and to the contradictions between social recovery from the war and official policies of rapid economic growth on the one hand, and on the other, continued inequities of wealth, low living standards for some, and a system of big business that has not traditionally been responsive to citizens' grievances.108 His cinema is profoundly contradictory in its formal design and discourse and, to this extent, Kurosawa himself should not be regarded as a transcendent author. He may, in fact, be viewed as yet another text, formed like his films by the strains of an unfolding social process. This conclusion is bolstered by a\n\nE W I N G\n\nK U R O S A W A\n\nreading of his autobiography, a text in which Kurosawa creates himself as text by constructing his life as a story and the films as a part of that story. What most impresses one from a reading of this account is the degree to which Kurosawa emerges as one of his own characters and the story of his life as a film he might have made. I discuss this later in more detail, but the point here is that the structural design of Kurosawa's cinema, more than that of many other directors, is one that is highly charged by formal, thematic, and narrational ambiguities and tensions. This is what David Desser alluded to when he referred to Kurosawa as a \"dialectical filmmaker.\"109 The design of Kurosawa's cinema, and its response to felt problems of cultural identity, needs to be regarded as a dynamic one: as a process marked by tensions, by achievements and setbacks, rather than as a consistent, and therefore static, system of themes and forms. Organized by a social conception that accords great value to the autonomous individual, these forms are charged with ideological value. The narrative design of the films and the unfolding of their visual codes are shaped by a central, organizing problematic. Kurosawa's films form a series of inquiries on the place and the possibilities of the autonomous self within a culture whose social relations stress group ties and obligations. Differing views prevail about the significance and the strength of these group ties. Some go so far as to suggest that because Japanese social institutions seem so hierarchical and group-oriented, the social space resting on the family as foundation and the emperor and state as \"capstone,\" conformity to social dictates is an ever-present tendency, even a threat to democractic life.110 In this view, group-derived norms centered about the family, clan, village, and emperor seem to swallow up the individual. Pointing to the antecedents of such a condition, Takeo Yazaki has remarked that \"In Edo society one could not observe any emerging freedom of the individual based on the rising power of the people from the bottom. There was lacking among the people any strong critical spirit or thought pattern based on respect for individual worth.\"111 By contrast, in his discussion of the construction of the Japanese self, Robert Smith strongly disagrees with such conclusions. He points out that \"it is frequently taken by foreign and Japanese observers alike that the ultimate goal of the individual is the complete suppression of the self or, more drastically, that the Japanese have no sense of the self at all. The conclusion does not follow.\"112 Other observers, even if seeming to subscribe to the view of Japanese society as rigidly hierarchical, have pointed to the existence of a tradition of rebellion throughout Japanese\n\n2 7\n\n28\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nhistory, a tradition that celebrates nonconformity and the rejection of authority. [W]hile the formal organization of Japanese society and the official norms of social behavior have been rigidly hierarchical and authoritarian, there has paradoxically always been a tacit acceptance, or sometimes even an open idealization, of certain trends which were in apparent opposition to the official norm. Thus, in Japanese social history there has been a tradition of glorifying such trends as the defense of their own rights by dissident groups, defiance of authority, individual action, and open personal achievement.113 Kurosawa's films, with their strong, rebellious protagonists and their visual style that celebrates excesses and transgressions, clearly belong to this latter tradition. They caution against resignation in the face of social oppression and offer heroes whose rebelliousness is meant as a role model for the audience. In developing the terms of these portrayals, Kurosawa clearly drew upon his own cultural heritage of agrarian uprisings, rebellious armed monks, and the strong samurai personalities of legend and folklore. Moreover, an ethic of individualism had begun to take root in late Meiji Japan. By the Taisho era, H. D. Harootunian writes, Meiji ideals of public dedication and self-sacrificing service had to accommodate a new ethic of success that honored the individual, that valorized \"the pursuit of the self alone in the private interest, a self no longer limited by concerns for family name or honoring one's native place.\"114 As is well known, the arts reflected these shifts. Soseki and other novelists, for example, began to explore the coordinates of this inner, individualized experience. Is the individualism of Kurosawa's characters primarily Japanese or Western? It is difficult to say in any definitive way. As noted, clear cultural precedents existed for the kind of rebellious heroes who would populate Kurosawa's cinema. It is also important to note, however, that when he began to work, it was under the constraints of war, when Imperial ideology was officially dominant, and subsequently under the Allied Occupation, when ideals of democracy and individualism gained renewed currency, this time by way of the West. It seems certain that, in this context, Western individualism furnished an ideological example. As I suggest in a later chapter, Kurosawa also drew from this influence, from the Western tradition where the autonomous individual is ac-\n\nV I E W I N G\n\nK U R O S A W A\n\n6.

(Museum of Modern Art/Film Stills Archive)\n\ncorded a discrete place in the social arena, a positioning that is less problematic than in Japanese culture. The wave of political repression and assassinations in the 1930s, when a virulent form of militarism cowed intellectuals and the Left with violent dreams of expanding empire and service unto death in honor of emperor and nation, demonstrated for Kurosawa the need for such an experiment at cross-cultural fertilization.115 \"The Japanese see self-assertion as immoral and selfsacrifice as the sensible course to take in life,\" Kurosawa has said.116 Referring to the chaotic condition of Japan's culture and economy immediately following the second world war, Kurosawa remarked, \"I believed at that time that for Japan to recover it was necessary to place a high value on the self. I still believe this.\"117 In his autobiography, he repeated his commitment, reiterating the terms of his own distinctive construction of the West for Japan: \"I felt that without the establishment of the self as a positive value there could be no freedom and no democracy.\"118 Through his cinema, Kurosawa has attempted to establish the autonomous self as a positive value, but to do this he had to construct a model that was counter to dominant cultural practices. As Smith has pointed\n\n29\n\n30\n\nC H A P T E R\n\nout, Japanese culture has constructed an awareness of self that is quite clearly marked and that might be termed an \"interactionist\" one, whereby self and social groupings exist only in relation to each other. \"A person is invariably identified as acting in some kind of human relationship, never autonomously. . . . [B]oth self and other can be expressed only in relational terms.\"119 Smith quotes Christie Kiefer's observation that the Japanese regard outward role demands as \"the really important center of the self\" and include within the boundaries of the concept of self \"much of the quality of the intimate social groups [e.g., the family or work associates with whom one is expected to spend a great deal of social time] of which the individual is a member.\"120 By contrast, Kiefer remarks, Americans' sense of self seems to \"stop at the skin.\" Kurosawa's radical gesture is to substitute a variant ideological conception of the self as an independent consciousness, bounded by its own imperatives, heedless, even defiant, of outward role demands.121 Kurosawa's heroes are severed from these intimate social groupings. Even if they have a family, they often struggle alone. By necessity, given a cultural context of interactionist, relational identities, the temerity of Kurosawa's gesture must couple the supremacy of the heroes' quest with a concomitant loneliness and anguish.122 The films that have resulted from this experiment form an extraordinarily rich cultural dialogue addressing their immediate moment: recovery from the second world war and the projection of a future course of cultural development. As such, these are implicitly, and very often quite explicitly, political films. Kurosawa himself, however, denies that politics figures in his films in any direct or conscious manner. In an interview in 1965, he was asked if he considered himself a committed filmmaker, and he replied: \"Absolutely not. People may think I am from watching my works, but that is the opinion of critics who judge a film right afterwards. My commitment is not deliberate or conscious. It's never the result of a decision. Politics is very important for me, but more as a private man . . . and not as a director.\"123 Politics for the private man, not the director.124 Kurosawa would have us believe this, yet his films speak another voice. They have addressed such topics as black-market criminality, government and corporate corruption, the partnership between political officials and gangsters, the inequities of wealth in contemporary Japan, the problem of nuclear weapons, and so on. These are not the subjects of a filmmaker indifferent to politics. Kurosawa himself has observed that if films lack topicality, they are also without meaning.125 In fact, if we read his words closely, it becomes clear that what he\n\nV\n\nI\n\nE\n\nW\n\nI\n\nN\n\nG\n\nK\n\nU\n\nR\n\nO\n\nS\n\nA\n\nW\n\nA\n\nis rejecting is not a committed cinema but th"
