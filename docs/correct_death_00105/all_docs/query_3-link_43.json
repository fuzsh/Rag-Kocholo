(1950, 88 min.)\n\nWith Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo,Â Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura\n\nMiller Theatre, Columbia University (116th St. & Broadway)\n\n8:30 PM\n\nKurosawaâs Oscar-winning film statement on the relativity (or unknowability) of Truth.Â A crime is witnessed by four individuals, and each later presents a version of the facts that is colored by self-interest and deception.

One of the most popular Japanese films in international release, Yojimbo inspired Sergio Leoneâs A Fistful of DollarsÂ (starring Clint Eastwood) and the genre of \"spaghetti-Westerns\" that followed.Â Â Since Yojimbo was itself inspired by American westerns, Kurosawa was not at all surprised by this \"reverse imitation.\"\n\nFilm: The Bad Sleep Well (Warui Yatsu Hodo Yoku Nemuru)\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa. (1960, 151 min.)\n\nWith Toshiro Mifune, Takeshi Kato, Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Kamatari Fujiwara, Kyoko Kagawa\n\nMiller Theatre, Columbia University (116th St. & Broadway) 8:30 PM\n\nIn Kurosawaâs powerful commentary on corruption in big business, a young man takes revenge for his fatherâs murder on powerful corporate and political leaders.Â Kurosawaâs fascinationÂ with the plays ofÂ Shakespeare resulted in powerful adaptations of Macbeth (Throne of Blood) and King Lear (Ran).Â In this film, the parallels with Hamlet are clear, but Kurosawa sets his mythic drama in the boardrooms of 20th-century Japan.\n\nPart of \"Kurosawa Remembered\" Film Series\n\nFebruary 24\n\nLecture: Edouard Manet's Posthumous Struggle for Glory:Â Scandal, Japonisme, and the Atelier Auction of 1884\n\nProf. Shigemi Inaga (Associate Professor, International Research Center for Japanese Studies)\n\n930 Schermerhorn, Columbia University (116th St. & Amsterdam Ave.)\n\n6:00 - 8:00 PM\n\nProfessor Inaga will speak aboutÂ Manet and Japonisme in his second public lecture as a Visiting Scholar at Columbia University's Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures.Â He is a member of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies (Kyoto) and holds degrees from both Tokyo University and the University of Paris.Â An art historian and specialist in French art and culture, Prof. Inaga has published numerous books and articles on French art of the 19th century, including his recent prize-winning book on Manetâs paintings, Kaiga no tasogare: Edouard Manet botsugo.Â He has also written extensively on Japanese art, literature, and comparative culture.\n\nMarch 1 (Monday)\n\nShakuhachi Master Class with Teruhisa Fukuda\n\nProf. Shigemi Inaga (Associate Professor, International Research Center for Japanese Studies)\n\n403 Kent Hall, Columbia University (116th St. & Amsterdam Ave.)\n\n6:00 - 8:00 PM\n\nTeruhisa Fukuda will finish up his American Debut Tour with Music From Japan by teaching a Shakuhachi Master Class at Columbia University.Â For reservations, please call the Institute for Medieval Japanese Studies at (212) 854-7403.Â Fees are $30 for participants (please bring music stands), $10 for observers, and $5 for student observers.Â Please make checks payable to Music from Japan.\n\nCo-sponsored by Music From Japan and the Institute for Medieval Japanese Studies\n\nMarch 2\n\nFilm: Throne of Blood (Kumonosu-jo)\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa.

The film is full of the imagery of the Noh drama, and viewers are plunged into an atmosphere of obsessive madness and supernatural compulsion. Stylized Noh-like acting and impeccable authenticity of historical details result in a film of overwhelming power and beauty.Â Film stars Toshiro Mifune, as the Macbeth-figure, and Isuzu Yamada, as his wife, give two of the mostÂ memorable performances of their long, celebrated careers.\n\nFilm: High and Low (Tengoku to Jigoku)\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa.
