        "text": "The alleged assassination last Monday of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of Kim Jong Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, has fascinated the world with its grisly details. He was attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by two women. They sprayed a liquid on his face and then pressed a wet rag to his eyes, nose and mouth. He died quickly, having being poisoned by a substance developed for use in chemical weapons, the deadly combination of agents V and X. Evidence points to the perpetrators being agents of North Korea, and Malaysia, once one of North Korea’s closest friends, has since recalled their ambassador. Since the killing, North Korea has tried to prevent a full medical investigation into the death, and it has been reported that someone tried to break into the morgue where the corpse of Kim Jong Nam was kept. As the plot thickens, it has all the elements of a thriller, although I’m not sure if I went to the cinema to see it I would find it very believable.\n\nThe implications for the world are serious. North Korea is a rogue state with a leader who is showing that he is not to be messed with. Estranged family members who pose a real or imaginary threat to his authority have been dealt with summarily, at home or abroad. And the testing of ballistic missiles has unsettled neighbouring countries and the Pacific region as a whole. North Korea’s stated aim is to be able to target cities on the US mainland with nuclear weapons.\n\nThe nuclear threat is something that people of my age group grew up with. In the 1980s as a well meaning and naïve teenager I marched in protest against nuclear arms. Those older than I will remember the Cuban missile crisis. It is hard to explain to those born in more stable times what it feels like to live in the shadow of imminent destruction, now the threat has receded as successive world leaders grapple with non proliferation treaties.\n\nI was reminded of this at the weekend as I watched a film by legendary Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa called I Live in Fear. A man drives himself literally insane worrying about the threat of H-bombs and radiation. His actions, as he tries to protect himself and his loved ones, becomes increasing eratic and ultimately tragic. In the end a doctor asks himself who is really mad, the one lone man who fears the logical consequences of nuclear weapons, or the rest of us who carry on living as normal?\n\nI also thought of the classic Kubrick satire Dr Stangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Trumps’ election and first few weeks in office has had elements of espionage, satire and farce which would not be out of place in such a film. On leaving office, President Obama warned President Trump that North Korea would be his top foreign policy problem. This now appears to be the case.\n\nTrump’s election brought the usual flood of predictions from experts as to how his policies would affect shipping. They were in two broad camps, those worried that his trade policies would affect the free movement of goods and therefore the demand of ships, and those that hoped that his economic policies would drive growth and provide a boost to international imports and exports. This is my view is a fairly flat, two dimensional response to what is a multi-dimensional world. The causes behind the rise and fall of shipping markets are anything but simple, and we have to be aware of the law of unintended consequences.\n\nTake for example the relationship between North Korea and China, an ally, if a long suffering one. The Chinese government have dragged their feet on imposing sanctions on North Korea because they fear the consequences of thousands of refugees fleeing the country if poverty gets worse. Kim Jong Nam’s death has made them act. He was living in Macau, the gambling enclave, under Chinese secret service protection. Before his death he was a vocal advocate of Chinese style market reforms in North Korea, and rumours had circulated that if the belligerent Supreme Leader became too difficult to handle they would replace him with the more amenable elder half brother.\n\nChina has therefore suffered a severe loss of face. One of their first reactions was a surprise: they have halted all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of 2017, effectively slicing the country's exports by about half. China can now show it is a responsible international player as it implements UN sanctions against the country (in comparison to the erratic foreign policy shown by the new US Administration). It can also remind North Korea that they survive under their protection only.\n\nThe surprise announcement however is not insignificant for shipping. China imported 22.5 million tonnes of coal in 2016, representing 12.3% of its total imports. This will now have to be replaced from other sources, the most natural being seaborne imports from Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. Representing around 125 cape size voyages, this is a large increase in tonne mile demand, and is already providing a welcome boost to the Pacific freight market. King Coal still rules the waves.\n\nAs I have been thinking and reading about the North Korean issue more, the more it has become clear to me that a small aggressive state in a corner of North East Asia can drive our world, the shipping world, in ways that we can least expect. A paper by John Delury in Foreign Affairs made the case that Trump has a unique opportunity to solve the North Korean problem with an economic deal and making the country more secure, and therefore less paranoid. This I feel is wishful thinking. Kim Jong Un has so far shown none of the rational thought that goes behind successful negotiations. Assuming he ordered the assassination, he risked antagonising two of his closest allies, China and Malaysia, to wipe out the opposition. Where things go from here is beyond me.\n\nBut as far as shipping is concerned, in a world where Brazilians are now importing coffee beans and Russian ambassadors freely hold discussions with incoming US National Security Advisors we should embrace this volatility, and be ready to act decisively. We need to remind ourselves that it is the political, as much as the economical world that shapes our fortunes. An increase in economic growth will always help, but it is an increase in tonne mile demand that really floats our boats. None of us would have thought that bulk carrier owners would be looking at a brighter future because of the actions of two women in a Malaysian airport, one of them, ironically enough, wearing a shirt with “LOL” written on it.\n\nSimon Ward\n\nFor company background, contact details and previous blogs see:\n\nwww.ursashipbrokers.com"
