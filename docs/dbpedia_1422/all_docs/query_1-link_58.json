        "text": "David L. Bolden, 67, of Benton, departed this life peacefully on April 6, 2024, in Delano surrounded by his family.\n\nHe was born on August 1, 1956, in Cleveland, to the late Wesley and Janie Mae Cheatham Bolden.\n\nAs a child, David loved to pick blackberries to enable him to purchase fireworks. He loved riding motorcycles, coached the 1991 Dodgers for Polk County Dixie Youth Baseball with James Woody, always enjoyed watching NASCAR, and could be heard from everyone on gamedayâ€™s while cheering on the Vols. A few of his fondest memories included collecting model cars and trains, and was a rocket enthusiast having taught his children how to build award winning models for 4-H.\n\nDavid was a faithful and active member of Benton Station Baptist Church, driving the church van on numerous retreats and trips, sang in the choir, and was willing to help with any other task that needed so he could spread the love of Jesus. He was loved by many and will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of having known him.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Wesley and Janie Mae Bolden, he was preceded in death by one aunt, Mary Magnolia Casson; uncles, Warren G. Woody, J.D. Woody, and Taff Woody.\n\nLeft to cherish the many memories include his beloved wife of 35 years, Connie Huff Bolden; loving children, Timothy Jason (Teaa) Liner, and Christina Marie (Dustin) Wilson; cherished grandchildren, Summer Wilson, Gavin Liner, Addison Grace Liner, Zoey Elizabeth Wilson, and Evan Alexander Wilson; one sister, Marilyn Schebel; one nephew, James (Marie) Gibson; and cousin, Tina (Johnny) Cross. Several extended family members and a host of friends also survive.\n\nA Celebration of Life service was held at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10, 2024, in the chapel of Higgins Funeral Home, with Pastor Ryan Potts and Rev. Charles Cheatham officiating.\n\nFamily and friends gathered from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, prior to the service at the funeral home.\n\nAn inurnment committal service will be held at 10:00 a.m. on June 29, 2024, at Benton Station Baptist Church Cemetery.\n\nThe family wishes to express their sincere appreciation to Hearth Hospice and nurses Laken King and Avery Morrison for their genuine care with comfort.\n\nExpressions of sympathy may be shared with the family at www.HigginsFuneral.com.\n\nArrangements are entrusted to Higgins Funeral Home of Benton."
