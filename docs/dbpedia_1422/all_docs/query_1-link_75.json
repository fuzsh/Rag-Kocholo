        "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ORDER DENYING PETITION TO QUASH, DENYING AS MOOT GOVERNMENT'S MOTION TO DISMISS, AND TERMINATING ACTION [1] Petitioners Mark A. LoBello and Barbara A. LoBello move the court to quash an IRS summons issued to Scripps Bank. After thoroughly considering the briefing submitted, the court denies the petition to quash. The court also denies as moot the government's motion to dismiss.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[2] The IRS and Revenue Agent John A. Best are conducting an examination into the LoBellos' federal tax liabilities for years 1995 and 1996. During the course of the investigation Agent Best determined that Scripps Bank may have information and/or records pertaining to the LoBellos' tax liabilities. Specifically, the investigation includes determining whether income earned by or in the name of the LoBellos were properly reported for the 1995 and 1996 tax years.\n\n[3] On August 4, 1999, the IRS issued a summons to Scripps Bank, directing an agent of the bank to appear and provide testimony and certain documents. An attested copy was mailed to Scripps Bank on August 5, 1999. On that same date, a notice of the summons was sent to the Lobellos by certified mail to their last known residential address. On September 10, 1999, the LoBellos moved to quash the IRS summons.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n[4] The IRS \"has broad powers to summon information relevant to determining the liability of any taxpayer.\" Chen Chi Wang v. United States, 757 F.2d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 1984). To obtain judicial enforcement of the summons, the IRS must satisfy the factors set forth in United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48 (1964). The IRS must show: \"(1) the investigation has a legitimate purpose, (2) the inquiry is relevant to that purpose, (3) the information sought is not already in the possession of the IRS, and (4) it followed all requisite administrative steps.\" United States v. Blackman, 72 F.3d 1418, 1422 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n[5] The IRS must make only a \"minimal showing\" on these elements. Id. The \"statute must be read broadly in order to ensure that the enforcement powers of the IRS are not unduly restricted.\" Liberty Fin. Servs. v. United States, 778 F.2d 1390, 1392 (9th Cir. 1985); see also (United States v. Tanoue, 94 F.3d 1342, 1345 (9th Cir. 1996). Assertions in a declaration by an investigating officer can satisfy the IRS's burden. Blackman, 72 F.3d at 1422; Liberty Fin., 778 F.2d at 1392.\n\n[6] If the IRS makes such a showing, the taxpayer then has a \"heavy\" burden to disprove the elements or to demonstrate an abuse of process or bad faith. Blackman, 72 F.3d at 1422; Liberty Fin., 778 F.2d at 1392. The taxpayer must present \"specific facts and evidence\" to support any allegations. Liberty Fin., 778 F.2d at 1392.\n\n[7] The court finds that the government has satisfied the Powell factors. As stated above and in Agent Best's declaration, the IRS is conducting an investigation into the LoBellos tax liabilities for years 1995 and 1996. The summons seeks the routine production of bank statements of certain accounts and transaction records of accounts over which the LoBellos had control for years 1995 and 1996. It is reasonable to assume that these documents may shed light on the LoBellos tax liabilities for 1995 and 1996. Agent Best also states in his declaration that the IRS does not already have possession of the documents and all administrative steps were followed.\n\n[8] The LoBellos have failed to demonstrate bad faith or an abuse of process. They first argue that the IRS has not first established that they have any tax liabilities. The IRS, however, is not required to make such a showing. The government has only a \"minimal\" burden of demonstrating the relevance of material requested in an IRS summons. David H. Tedder & Assoc. v. United States, 77 F.3d 1166, 1168-69 (9th Cir. 1996). The government simply must demonstrate that the summons \"might throw light\" upon any tax liabilities. Id. The government must have a \"realistic expectation rather than an idle hope\" that relevant even potential relevance to an ongoing investigation.\" United States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805, 814 (1984). As discussed above, the IRS has met this burden.\n\n[9] The court finds their remaining arguments to be meritless. They are not entitled to an attested copy of the summons or personal service. 26 U.S.C. section 7609(a); Fortney v. United States, 59 F.3d 117, 120 (9th Cir. 1995). They argue that, pursuant to section 7609(a)(3), the bank is not a third-party recordkeeper. This section, however, has been repealed. Further, even if not repealed, as a bank, Scripps Bank was clearly a third-party recordkeeper. Finally, the IRS did not act improperly by issuing the summons by use of the standard IRS Form 2039.\n\n[10] Because the court denies the motion to quash the petition, the above-entitled action shall be terminated. The government's motion to dismiss, therefore, is denied as moot.\n\n[11] IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\nDATED: 1-27-00.\n\nMarilyn L. Huff, Chief Judge United States District Court"
