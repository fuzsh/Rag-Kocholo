        "text": "Perry L. Bache, age 90, of Dover, passed away peacefully on December 17, 2020 in Dover’s Park Village Health Care Center.\n\nBorn October 5, 1930, in Dennison, he was the son of the late George and Winifred Brown Bache. Perry served honorably in the Elite Forces of the United States Army in Europe, receiving an Occupational Medal for his service in Germany. After his military service, Perry dedicated his life to supporting the men and women of the United States Armed Services through volunteer and fundraising opportunities as a life member of the VFW, AMVETS and a member of the Elks. Perry retired from The Timken Company after 30 years of employment at the New Philadelphia Bearing Plant.\n\nPerry is survived by his sister, Marilyn Monaco of Dover; his nephews, Steve Monaco and Mark Monaco; and his nieces, Lisa (Monaco) Hallam, Hallie Kuperman and Beth Kuperman. Besides his parents, he was preceded in death by his sister, Jeanne Kuperman.\n\nArrangements are in the care of the Toland-Herzig Funeral Home & Crematory, Dover. Due to COVID restrictions the family will honor Perry’s life through a private memorial ceremony at a later date.\n\nThe family suggests that contributions in Perry's memory be made to the VFW, 441 Park Ave. N.W., or to the AMVETS, 220 First Dr. S.W., both addresses at New Philadelphia, Ohio 44663."
