        "text": "Lucent Technologies v. Microsoft\n\nThis case involved one of the largest awards for a computer code patent infringement in history. The original award was for $368 million.[3] Microsoft made a motion for The final amount awarded with interest was $512 million.[4] The case involved a patent claim involving selecting a date from a pop-up calendar and the use of a stylus.[4]\n\nCooper v. Brown\n\nAfter a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed Judge Huff's ruling in a death penalty case, the court declined to hear the case en banc over strenuous dissents. In a concurrence, Judge Pamela Ann Rymer praised Judge Huff's \"thoughtful 159-page ruling\" and \"meticulous detail.\"[5]\n\nEleven judges vigorously dissented. In unusually strong language, the mild mannered and respected jurist Judge William Fletcher wrote: \"There is no way to say this politely. The district court failed to provide Cooper a fair hearing.\"[6]\n\nSergeant Gary A. Stein v. United States of America\n\nThis case involved a Marine seeking a temporary restraining order against the Marine Corps. Stein stated that the Marine Corps did not follow their own procedures and the timing and content of the administrative separation proceedings were a deliberate attempt to \"railroad\" Stein by denying him time to prepare a defense or the ability to seek legal counsel. The majority of the complaint was ignored and the motion was denied on the basis that the panel's decision was not a \"sure thing\" and that Stein was unable to demonstrate irreparable harm.[7][8]"
