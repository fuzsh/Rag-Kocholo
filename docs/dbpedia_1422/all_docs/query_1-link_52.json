The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Jeff Sessions (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senators Sessions, Kyl, and Feinstein. Also present: Senators Murkowski and Ensign. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Chairman Sessions. Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts will come to order. I am pleased to convene this hearing to consider a division of the Ninth Circuit. You might say, here we go again. It has been a year and a half since we last discussed this topic in the Subcommittee and I am looking forward to hearing the witnesses and their testimonies, all of whom have traveled a long way and have dedicated, many of you, quite a lot of hours in personal time and attention to develop your well-researched opinions on the topic before us today. I appreciate Senator Feinstein for her interest in this. We work together on the Judiciary Committee. No one works harder or is more committed to doing the right thing and we are delighted that you could be with us, you and some of our other members who will probably appear before long that are interested in the Ninth Circuit, Senators who represent States in the Ninth Circuit. So we are eager to hear the opinions of the distinguished jurists before us. It is going to be very helpful to us. It is, however, the constitutional duty of the Congressional branch, the legislative branch, to create such inferior courts, quote, ``as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,'' Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution. So it is with this constitutional duty in mind we have convened today's hearing. Our question is whether the enormous size of the Ninth Circuit is an impediment to the administration of justice and whether a division of the circuit would enhance justice. The division of circuits has been a normal and natural evolution of judicial organization in our country and it has succeeded, I believe, each time it has been tried. Most recently, Congress recognized this need when it decided to split the Fifth Circuit into two separate courts of appeals. In 1973, the Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, the Hruska Commission, recommended that the Fifth and Ninth Circuits be split. In 1980, the Congress split only the Fifth, carving out a new 11th Circuit, and I think I told you last time, as a new U.S. Attorney, I was in Atlanta at the formation ceremony of that 11th Circuit. Judge John Godbold, who had been the Chief Judge of the old Fifth, supported the division and became the new Chief at the 11th. I think that all those judges have felt very good about that division in the years since. The recommendation, however, to divide the Ninth Circuit was not acted upon. In the year prior to this division, for example, the old Fifth Circuit's 26 judges disposed of 4,717 appeals. In 1995, the combined 29 judges from the old Fifth and the 11th disposed of nearly triple that number of appeals, 12,401. In a Montana Law Review article by Ninth Circuit Senator Conrad Burns, he noted, quote, ``tripling the output of the Fifth Circuit while only adding three new judgeships certainly indicates that splitting the Fifth Circuit yielded a long-term benefit for all.'' I will add that the testimony before this Subcommittee several years ago by Chief Judge Gerald Tjoflat of the 11th Circuit was unequivocal. He said that their current level of harmony and collegiality and efficiency would not be possible in a much larger circuit. As a matter of fact, he was dubious of even taking new judges. He would rather the workload go up to keep the numbers smaller. So today, we must face the problem of the unprecedented size of the Ninth Circuit and consider the options to improve administration of justice. The Ninth Circuit covers 40 percent of our country's land mass and stretches from Northern Alaska, and Judge, we are glad to have you down from Fairbanks, to the Mexican border. It encompasses more States than any of the other 11 circuits and manages almost one-fourth of the caseload of the whole United States, 14,800 to 63,000 total filings of the other circuits. The Ninth Circuit claims one-fifth of the nation's population, 58 million, within its jurisdiction. That is almost three times the average population of any other circuit, or the other circuits. Though the Fifth Circuit was split 25 years ago, largely due to its size, the Ninth Circuit currently has almost the same population as the current Fifth and 11th Circuits, both of which have also grown. Today, the Ninth Circuit has 58 million people while the 11th and Fifth Circuits together have 60. At our April 2004 hearing, we learned a lot about the numbers impacting the Ninth Circuit. Today, those numbers are still dramatic. The Ninth Circuit has 28 authorized judgeships, 24 active and four vacancies, and 23 senior judges, for a total of 51 judges. That amounts to 11 more active judgeships than the next-largest circuit, and it is more than double the average number of authorized judgeships in the other circuits. If you add senior judges to the authorized judgeship numbers, the Ninth Circuit has 24 more judges than the total number of the next-largest circuit. As of June 30, 2005, the Ninth Circuit had more than triple the number of appeals filed in 2005 than the average of all the other circuits and has 6,000 more filings in 2005 than the next busiest circuit. Though the average caseload increase between 2000 and 2005 for a circuit court was just over 14 percent, the Ninth Circuit's caseload increase was by almost 70 percent, which is a really stunning figure to me. During that same time--I will skip that. And the rate of increase has continued steadily. From 1997 to 2003, the Ninth Circuit caseload bore a 48.1 percent increase. Now, it is a 70 percent increase. It is still going up. The large number of judges and the caseload burdens do appear to have impaired the administration of justice in the circuit. The Ninth's efficiency in deciding appeals, that is the time the court takes between the filing of a notice of appeal and the final disposition, has consistently lagged behind other circuits. In 2003, for example, the Ninth Circuit had 418 cases pending for 3 months or more, almost the same as the next five circuits combined. The next highest circuit had 98 such cases. The next charts shows that 138 cases were pending in the Ninth Circuit for over a year. This was more than every other circuit in the Federal system combined, with the next highest circuit at a mere 19 cases. According to the latest statistics, the Ninth Circuit takes almost 40 percent longer to dispose of an appeal than the average of all of the other circuits. The Ninth takes 15.4 months and the average is 11.1 months. Please note that this delay cannot be explained solely by a lack of judgeships, because although the caseload for the Ninth is high--it is high--several other circuits have higher caseloads per judge than the Ninth. I would also note, time of disposition is important to litigants. Huge impacts are at stake as a court's cases sit on that docket. I would like to see the average of 11.1 months be reduced, frankly, and I think the addition to 15 is a significant concern. The limited en banc procedures employed by the Ninth Circuit, coupled with the large number of public opinions issued each year, make it impossible for the Ninth to speak with clarity and consistency, it seems to me. A circuit with as many judges and as many opinions as the Ninth Circuit has loses collegiality and unity. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit's limited en banc procedures have permitted a random draw of ten judges plus the Chief Judge to be the final review of a three- judge panel decision. This can result and has resulted in a mere six judges making the law for the entire circuit. Even though the circuit has recently voted to increase the number of judges that sit en banc to 15, that number still allows a mere eight judges to make the law for the entire circuit. In all other circuits, en banc means en banc, what it always has meant, the full court. Finally, with so many cases decided each year, it is hard for any one judge to read all the opinions of his or her peers and it is virtually impossible for lawyers who practice in the circuit to stay abreast of the law. In 2004 alone, the Ninth Circuit published 691 decisions. That is over 60 a month. These factors, loss of collegiality, the limited en banc, and the inability to monitor new law, undermine the goal of certainty in the law. I hope that each of the Ninth Circuit judges testifying before us today will speak to these factors and tell us how they impact the Ninth Circuit's ability to maintain clear and consistent law in the circuit. [The prepared statement of Chairman Sessions appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Sessions. Now, three of my Ninth Circuit colleagues are here today, or at least two--I guess three counting Senator Feinstein, and I think maybe another one will show up, to help us explore the issues surrounding the decision to split the Ninth Circuit. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has been a leader in addressing reorganization of the Ninth Circuit and has introduced legislation to restructure the circuit both in this Congress and in the last. Her comments based on her experience as a Senator from the Northwest and as a lawyer who practiced within the Ninth Circuit will give us a useful context for understanding the issues. I also see my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Kyl here, who has not only argued cases before the Ninth Circuit, on numerous occasions, he has argued a bunch of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. He is clearly our most experienced attorney probably in the Senate, and Jon, we are glad to have you here. I know this is a matter close to your heart and we look forward to hearing you. Senator Feinstein, thank you for your leadership on these issues. I know you have watched it very closely over the years and we are delighted to hear from you at this time, and then we will go to Senator Kyl and Senator Murkowski. STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Fine. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome each of the judges that is here. It is a long trip from the West Coast, and so we really appreciate it. I would like to acknowledge the fact that today is the Chief Judge's 40th wedding anniversary and guess where she is, right here, and so-- [Laughter.] Chairman Sessions. We are impressed. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very, very much for being here. As the Chairman has said, the Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit court of appeals in the Nation in both population and caseload. Advocates for splitting the Ninth Circuit often cite the size as a basis for dividing it. However, I think what matters is not the size of the Ninth, but whether the Ninth meets its charge of providing justice to those living in the States. The current Ninth Circuit, I believe, achieves this goal. As I have looked at the various proposals over the years that have come before this Committee, splitting the Ninth is a lose-lose proposition. There are clear financial costs to the split. The Administrative Office of the Courts has submitted documentation. I will speak about that in a few minutes. And there are clear and dramatic costs to the administration of justice. The uniformity of law in the West is a key advantage of the Ninth, as large as it is. It provides consistency among Western States that share many common concerns. For example, splitting the circuit could result in one interpretation of a law governing trade with Mexico in California and a different one in Arizona, or in the application of environmental regulations one way on the California side of Lake Tahoe and another way on the Nevada side. The efficiency of the Ninth is also a significant consideration. As presently constituted, the Ninth is one of the most efficient courts of appeals in the nation. Splitting the Ninth Circuit into two or even three courts of appeals would require the creation of new and costly bureaucracies to administer these new courts, thereby losing the economy of scale which has been achieved by having a single administration tending to the Federal courts of the Ninth Circuit. Dividing up the Ninth Circuit would also require additional Federal funds for new or expanded courthouses and administrative buildings, as existing judicial facilities would be insufficient for the new circuit or circuits. Yesterday, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts provided me with a letter estimating the costs for splitting the Ninth Circuit under S. 1845, which would split the Ninth Circuit into the Ninth and 12th Circuits. The Administrative Office estimates that the split to two circuits would have a startup cost of $95,855,172 and would have $15, almost $16 in annual new recurring costs. In a two-way split with a circuit headquarters in Phoenix, with the new judgeships, the cost is $15.9 million, the startup cost $95,800,000. The two-way split with the 12th Circuit headquarters in Seattle, with new judgeships, the cost is $13,140,049 and the startup costs $13,815,801. The cost of the seven additional judgeships in annual recurring costs is $5.656 million, with startup costs of $1.156 million. This is a rather lengthy letter and I would like to place it in the record so that everybody could have a chance of reviewing it. But let me summarize by saying these are substantial costs, particularly considering that the judiciary budget is already stretched thin. Finally, one must consider what organization of the Ninth Circuit--must consider that it will be fair to all of the States of the current Ninth. The plan to split the Ninth leaves the States remaining in the Ninth with a far higher caseload per judge than those States that would move to a new 12th or 13th Circuit. They become easy. You can put your feet up on the desk, because they would have very few cases. That is the bottom line. Under the current proposals, California and Hawaii would be left in the Ninth, while Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska would move to a new circuit or circuits. These proposals would create nice sinecures with low caseloads for judges in the newly created 12th or 13th Circuit but would disadvantage what would remain in the largest circuit in the nation. The new Ninth would still have 72 percent of the cases in the old Ninth. However, even with the addition of the five permanent and two temporary judgeships proposed in the two bills before the Senate, the new Ninth Circuit would have only 60 percent of the judges. So they would have 72 percent of the caseload, but 60 percent of the judges. Is this fair? I don't think so. The caseload in the new Ninth would be 536 cases per judge as opposed to 317 cases per judge for the proposed 12th. This would leave judges in the Ninth with 219 more cases per judge. This is simply not a fair distribution of judicial resources. So we create all this new additional courthouses, administration, circuits, and yet 72 percent of the cases remain in the Ninth. For the judges in the new Ninth to have a comparable caseload to judges in the new 12th, the Ninth would need an additional 14 judges on top of the five permanent and two temporary judges created by the bills before the Committee. In total, 21 new judges would need to be added to the Ninth Circuit for a split to be fair. Now, you can be sure that representing California, I am not going to let an unfair distribution of caseload happen. I am just not going to do it. This would entail its own problems and costs and it highlights the difficulties created by proposals to split the Ninth. Opposition to splitting the Ninth comes from judges and State bar associations that would move into a proposed new circuit as well as those that would remain in the Ninth Circuit. Only three of the active judges on the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, favor splitting the circuit, and we are going to hear from one today. He is very respected. I have had an opportunity of having at least an hour with him to discuss this, Judge O'Scannlain in San Francisco, and I very much appreciate his point of view. I thought a lot about it. But unless you want to guarantee those 21 new judges for the Ninth and an equal caseload across the field, I would be foolish to let a split happen to the circuit that I represent. Additionally, the bar associations of Arizona, of Washington, of Montana, and Hawaii have all voiced their opposition to breaking up the Ninth Circuit. Washington State says they strongly oppose both bills. We believe there is no legitimate reason to split this jurisdiction, and certainly no reason to incur the very substantial costs that such a split will generate. We further believe that our democratic process demands formal hearings on this matter, which, of course, we are having. It says that the Washington State Bar debated the issues of size, regional differences among the States, judicial collegiality, and necessary consistency in rulings. The Board of Governors of our organization unanimously concluded that splitting the Ninth would not serve the interests of justice or the citizens of the State of Washington. The State Bar of Montana has passed a resolution which says in a ``whereas'' clause, a divided circuit would remove the numerous benefits which Montana enjoys as a part of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth, and whereas a divided circuit would result in additional one-time construction and division costs and increased annual administrative expenses, et cetera, they oppose it. The Hawaii State Bar says they believe the composition of the Ninth serves the public well, representing as it does diverse demographic areas as well as a broad range of political and economic constituencies. And the Arizona Bar says, at its regular meeting in Phoenix on August 19 of this year, the State Bar Board of Governors analyzed the proposals to reorganize the Ninth. Further, the Board discussed how the bar is served by the current configuration and considered the fiscal impact of splitting the circuit. The Board voted to reaffirm its longstanding position to oppose splitting the Ninth Circuit. I would like to ask that these letters also be included in the file. Chairman Sessions. We will make them a part of the record. Senator Feinstein. So unless somebody can guarantee me that there will be 21 new judges and an equal caseload spread, this thing doesn't even get to first base with me because I think we hurt the administration of justice, we create new costs, and we don't even the caseload, and I thank you very much. Chairman Sessions. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. They are not all equal now, that is for sure, but we probably should look at that more. [The prepared statement of Senator Feinstein appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Sessions. Senator Kyl, and Senator Ensign, did he come in? Oh, there you are. Do you want to stay there or would you like to join us? You can stay right there, if you would like. STATEMENT OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Senator Kyl. Mr. Chairman, I will just be very brief because we really do want to hear from our witnesses and also because after I have heard an argument such as that just delivered by Senator Feinstein, my lawyer juices flow. I immediately want to take the other side. I would like, first of all, Senator Feinstein, to assure you that as of right now, I guarantee you that there will be an equal number of judges with a caseload that is essentially identical. Are we on first base? Senator Feinstein. Well, it is-- [Laughter.] Senator Kyl. You don't need to answer that. I am not the cross examiner and you are not the witness. Senator Feinstein, I just-- Senator Feinstein. If you make the guarantee-- Senator Kyl. Yes, if I can make the guarantee. I just conducted a-- Chairman Sessions. You two have made good partners on a lot of matters and maybe you yet can make partnership on this one. Senator Kyl. Let me just speak to that for a moment, because we are--Senator Murkowski, Senator Ensign, and the two of us, of course, all have a dog in this hunt, being that we represent Ninth Circuit States. It is important to us. We do listen to our lawyers and judges, although I would say polls of lawyers and judges, while probative, aren't necessarily dispositive given our responsibilities that extend beyond representing our colleagues in the bar or on the bench. But we have worked together on a lot of things and I have made it clear that I understand that Arizonans are of two minds on this. I have, at one time or another, had different views on this subject. I find that a lot of the arguments just remind me of when I practiced law. When a lawyer passionately believes in the cause of a client, you can make great arguments on both sides. But I think there is a lot about the arguments that is not so great. What I have told Senator Feinstein privately, I will tell all of you, and that is that she has a big stake in this. California is the big elephant in the room, if you want to put it that way, and it cannot be--we can't override the interests of a State like California, nor should one State dominate over all others. There is going to be a lot of give and take here. We are all going to work with each other and try to come to a conclusion that represents the best interests of our constituents. So I don't view this as just a majority-minority thing in terms of political parties, nor do I think one State should dominate, nor do I think all the other States should join and pick on California. And I do believe that if there is to be a division, it needs to be done fairly, and since caseload is one of the dominant factors here, there does need to be an appropriate relationship between the judges and the caseload and that would mean a fair division along the line that Senator Feinstein suggested. But here is what I will close with. I know that for many of you, this has been going on a long time, and when I first came to the Senate, we immediately began hearings on this subject. So I have been involved in it for a long time. But don't take the fact that there are a couple of bills out here as evidence that this is all locked in stone. For example, arguments about cost are not very persuasive to me because I don't think you have got it right in terms of what the costs are. You do have to take what is in front of you in terms of a bill's language, and I understand that, and so you have to figure out, all right, if that is where the head of the circuit is and lawyers are going to be arguing in these two other cities or whatever, what might that cost? But there isn't a single new courthouse that has to be built. So let us be realistic about costs. I know opponents love to talk about costs. I would just recommend to you that you get a little bit more realistic about that. Just like proponents talk about the politics of it, I would suggest we get the politics out of it right now. I don't know what the politics of two new circuits are going to be, and in one sense, that ought not to be the consideration here. So there are things that advocates love to talk about that I think on the Committee here we need to cull out of the discussion. Let me just say that I see this as a process involving both Houses of Congress, both parties. I really commend the Chairman for having this Subcommittee hearing. He and his staff have done a lot of work, and all of us, I think, are going to have to discuss this. We are going to have to visit with all of you. We are going to have to take your arguments on board and think it through very carefully and try to come out with what we think is the right answer and the fairest answer if there is to be a division. If everyone will just take a deep breath and look at this in a realistic and not an advocate way, I think we just might be able to come to some conclusions that are agreed to, for the most part, by most people. And finally, I thank everybody for being here. I know it was very difficult, especially in the case of Chief Judge Schroeder, who not only has personal matters but other matters to attend to and I think it involves a red-eye either last night or tonight. So I know how important this is to all of you and I really do appreciate the interest that you have had. Please continue to talk to us. I appreciate your being here today, and let us all just handle this in a problem solving way. How is that? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sessions. Well said. Senator Murkowski? STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALASKA Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you-- Chairman Sessions. I will also note Senator Murkowski is a practicing lawyer in Alaska and has herself quite a bit of experience in these matters. Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Senator Kyl. Might I, with your indulgence, correct the record? I would not want the record to go uncorrected. I have briefed a lot of cases to the Supreme Court. Only three have seen oral argument. However, all three of my clients were the prevailing party. [Laughter.] Chairman Sessions. Let me ask you, Senator, is there any other Senator who has argued three cases in the U.S. Supreme Court? Senator Kyl. No, I don't think so, but-- Chairman Sessions. Well, then I wasn't incorrect. [Laughter.] Senator Murkowski. Humility and modesty gets you everywhere. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the invitation to be with you in this Committee today. I also want to welcome all of the judges that have taken the time to be with us and I want to extend a special welcome to my judge representing us in Alaska, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld. I appreciate you making the long trek down. As Senators from the West, this is an issue that has been discussed a great deal. I think there has long been a focus on the Ninth Circuit and its effectiveness and its efficiency as a circuit court of appeals. Senator Ensign and I have come at this issue, both of us with a little different approach and joined together in introducing S. 1824, the Circuit Court of Appeals Restructuring and Modernization Act of 2005. I don't know whether this is a nudge to California, but I will note that the acronym is CCARMA, so for whatever that is worth. [Laughter.] Senator Murkowski. You ought to appreciate that in California. But Senator Ensign and I looked at this issue, as I say, perhaps from a little different perspective, but we recognize that in order to advance this, in order to get to a place where I think we can see real efficiencies and see real effectiveness within the court in addressing the ever-increasing caseload, that we must do something to move forward with a division of the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Chairman, you have noted all of the statistics, the geographic size, nearly 40 percent of the geographic area of the United States, the population serving 58 million people more than double the size of the other circuits, and then the emphasis and the focus on the caseload, and the fact that the Ninth Circuit docket is ever increasing. Last year, it had nearly a 60 percent higher caseload than the next largest circuit. Immigration cases alone--and I find this figure absolutely staggering--immigration cases alone have increased by an astounding 463 percent. This causes delays in the circuit, and as you have noted, the average time for final disposition of a case is 5 months longer than the national average. Now, some on this panel may argue that the Ninth Circuit is not inefficient. They will defend the court. They will say that the State improvements have been made to the lengthy period in which a case is dispensed, and I truly do applaud the efforts of the court, the very hard work and all that has gone into that. But we need to recognize, you can tread water for a while, but I think in the instance of the Ninth Circuit, the tidal wave is coming and it is a tidal wave that can't be stopped. It is a tidal wave called population growth. Mr. Chairman, I have got a couple charts here. The Ninth Circuit--I have already said this--has a population more than double of most of the circuits, but it doesn't stop there. The Ninth Circuit also contains the fastest-growing States in the nation. So if you look at the chart, California is the first largest, Hawaii is the third, Arizona the fourth, Nevada the fifth, Idaho the sixth, Alaska the eighth. The numbers speak for themselves. Right now, we have a caseload that is overwhelming, but with the population and the demographics in the area, we can only anticipate that it gets worse. We can't sit back and watch these warning signs without acting. It would be irresponsible for us not to act, and I believe it would misuse Congress's constitutional authority to effectively manage the courts if we do not act. So what we have done with CCARMA is what I believe is sensible reorganization of the Ninth Circuit, dividing it into the Ninth and into the new 12th. The distances and populations will be more proportionate. It creates circuits with more manageable populations and more manageable travel distance, which I think will reduce wasted time and money spent on judicial travel. The caseload will be more manageable, and this is a point that goes directly to Senator Feinstein's concern, and very real and very legitimate. We must do what we can to make the caseloads more manageable. A smaller circuit will mean a lower volume of caseload. The reality, as has been said, California, as the largest State, and California, as the fastest growing State, is going to have an exceedingly large caseload. But anything that we can do to help reduce that is a step that we should take. Reductions in caseload will improve the uniformity and the consistency in case law. So this legislation that Senator Ensign and I have moved forward may not be the only way to divide the circuit, but I do believe that it is a sensible division. I think it is a solution that is long overdue. As you mentioned, we have had precedents in dividing both the Fifth and the Eighth Circuits and the reasons for doing that were just exactly what we are faced with today in the Ninth, responding to a caseload and a population growth. We must recognize that the direction that we are taking in the West with our growing population, recognizing the huge caseload, the 58 million people that are being served right now, we have got a responsibility. We cannot wait. We have all heard the phrase, ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' and I think in the Ninth Circuit it is time we figure out how we make that accommodation, make the split to provide for justice in the Western States. So I appreciate the Committee taking the time to review this and look forward to working with you and all the other members as we move this forward. [The prepared statement of Senator Murkowski appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Sessions. Thank you, Senator Murkowski. You have put forth legislation. You have talked with other Senators and been accommodating and tried to work with other Senators to develop the best possible legislation. You have been open minded about that and we thank you. Senator Ensign, likewise, has felt strongly about this issue and has worked diligently to consider every possible suggestion. I guess you and Senator Murkowski are together now on your suggestions, so Senator Ensign, we are delighted to have you to talk about your circuit, the Ninth Circuit. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Ensign. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senator Feinstein. I appreciate the comments that you made. I want to associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Alaska. A lot of the points that she had made, I think are right on target. But I also want to address to Senator Feinstein that this is not about attacking the Ninth Circuit. It is not about attacking the State of California. The reality is, we have to ask ourselves why do we have the circuits that we have today? Why don't we just have one or two or just a few circuits around the country? The reason we add circuits or we divide circuits is for more efficient management. Companies do this. There are all kinds of reasons for efficiencies, and what has been laid out today, whether it is delays, whether it is number of caseloads, whatever it is, whatever is happening today, I mean, we understand. My State is the fastest growing rate-wise. California is the fastest growing as far as total population. The number of people, that is not going to change. The West is going to continue to be the fastest growing area in the United States. When we have the populations that we have today, and knowing that this situation is going to continue to get worse, it seems to me that without splitting the circuit, the burden that is going to be put on the courts, and therefore the burden on our citizens for delaying their justice is going to continue to get worse in the future. Senator Murkowski and I, we had different approaches. Her approach last time was a reasonable approach. I thought my approach last time was a reasonable approach. I obviously liked my approach last time better than this time, but we have been willing to compromise. We came together on legislation and we are both open to changing the legislation if people have better ideas. We want to be open to the marketplace of ideas on restructuring the Ninth Circuit. But to be wed to say that it is functioning well today and cannot be improved by splitting it up, I think is closed minded. When I first was elected to the House of Representatives, this was being talked about back then because the West was so fast growing back then. And I remember talking to the judges in the State of Nevada, and unanimously, they were opposed to splitting the Ninth Circuit. Well, today, as far as the District of Nevada, every single one of the judges is for splitting the Ninth Circuit, every single one of them. And one of the two on the Ninth Circuit are for splitting from my State. So the judges have come a long way in changing their minds because they are seeing the realities of the way that the court is functioning. So I know there are differences of opinion. I guess being the only non-lawyer here, I don't have the experience in the courtroom, but I have the experience listening to my constituents and I am here to represent them to say that we would like to see faster justice done in the courts through a more efficiently run Ninth Circuit. I believe that the legislation that we have put forward would achieve that, and once again, I am glad that Senator Kyl said, let us put ideology out the door. Let us put a lot of those other arguments out the door, because just based on the merits to make it more efficient, to reflect the population growth of today, there is plenty of justification for splitting up the Ninth Circuit. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I know we have a vote coming up on budget reconciliation in the Budget Committee, so I have to get back there, as well, so I thank you for the time and allowing me to testify today. Chairman Sessions. I guess Chairman Gregg would like me to be back for that vote, perhaps-- [Laughter.] Chairman Sessions [continuing]. Since there is no proxy voting in the Budget Committee and it might be attacked without me. We have got two panels of witnesses today. The first, we will discuss the judgeship caseload numbers that seem to evidence a continuing need to divide the Ninth Circuit. We will also discuss whether a two-way split or a three-way split would be better and we will address the recent cost estimates for a division. Very interesting to me will be the discussion concerning currently empty Federal courthouses in Seattle and Portland, each of which are able, clearly, it appears, to serve as a seat for the 12th. The witnesses on this panel, starting from my left, are Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, who was appointed to the Ninth Circuit in 1986; Judge Richard Tallman, appointed in 2000; Chief Judge Mary Schroeder, appointed in 1979; and Judge Alex Kozinski, appointed in 1985. On the second panel, we will gain more insight into the Ninth Circuit as we explore the possibility of housing a new 12th Circuit in Phoenix, again, without, we believe, having to build a new courthouse to do so. We will again hear from four witnesses on that panel. So, ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted to have you here. Judge O'Scannlain, we are delighted to let you start off. STATEMENT OF DIARMUID O'SCANNLAIN, CIRCUIT JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, PORTLAND, OREGON Judge O'Scannlain. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. My name is Diarmuid O'Scannlain, United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit with chambers in Portland, Oregon. I am very much honored to be invited to participate in this hearing on revisiting proposals to split the circuit. Indeed, the urgency of restructuring the largest judicial circuit in the country is even more evident today, in my view, by the number of Ninth Circuit reorganization bills pending in both Houses of Congress this session, perhaps the highest number in Congressional history. As you know, Senator Ensign, who has just appeared before you, on behalf of Senators Kyl and Murkowski and five other sponsors, recently introduced the latest Senate Ninth Circuit reorganization bill, which is S. 1845, which is, I understand, the central focus of your hearing today. Although I have this prepared statement to make, I do want to be able to respond to the very kind invitation from my good friend, Senator Feinstein, with whom I have started a dialog of sorts, to pursue the questions which she raises, which I am very happy to do and which I hope I can do after I finish my prepared statement, or when it is time for questions and answers, if that is appropriate, Senator. It is inevitable that Congress must restructure the Ninth Circuit and I think S. 1845 is a perfectly legitimate vehicle for accomplishing that goal. It bears emphasis, however, that since I last appeared before you on April 7 of 2004, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking arm of the Federal judiciary, has now gone on record as expressing neutrality on splitting the Ninth Circuit. This is a most significant change, indeed. Also, the Attorney General of the United States, Alberto Gonzales, announced that the United States Department of Justice now supports a split of the Ninth Circuit without specifying which particular configuration it prefers. The passage by the House of Representatives of a Ninth Circuit split bill last year and recent indications of its doing so again very shortly, the newly expressed non-opposition by the Judicial Conference, and the support of the Attorney General, and the widening support across the country for splitting the Ninth Circuit auger well for Congressional action this year. Let me emphasize that S. 1845, like any restructuring proposal, should be analyzed solely on the grounds of effective judicial administration, grounds that remain unaffected by Supreme Court batting averages and public reaction to any of our individual high-profile decisions. My support of the fundamental restructuring of the Ninth Circuit has never been premised on the outcome of any given case. I believe that the sheer magnitude of our court and its responsibilities negatively affect all aspects of our business, including our solidarity, our consistency, our clarity, and even, sadly, our collegiality. Simply put, the Ninth Circuit is too big. It is time now to take the prudent, well-established course and bring the Ninth Circuit into line with the rest of the circuits in the Federal judicial system. Restructuring large circuits is the natural process of judicial evolution, as you can see if you would look at the appendix part of my testimony, beginning at page 17, you will see Exhibit 1, which runs for two or three pages. This shows the history of the evolution of circuits since 1789, and starting with the Evarts Act, you, Congress, have restructured circuits four times since 1891, most recently the Fifth Circuit just 25 years ago. I believe that the legislation today before you represents a workable restructuring plan and I urge you to give it serious consideration. From a purely numerical perspective, the enormity of my court is undeniable, and none of the comments today have refuted the numbers that are so oppressive to us as we look at this issue. That doesn't matter whether you measure by number of judges, population, or caseload. If you would turn to Exhibit 4 on page 24, you will see that at 28 authorized judgeships, our court of appeals has 11 more authorized judgeships than the next-largest circuit. Exhibit 5 indicates that the Ninth Circuit has more than double the average number of judgeships of all other circuit courts of appeals. The Ninth Circuit has 22 more total judges than the next-largest circuit. At 51 authorized and senior judgeships, the Ninth Circuit has more than double the average number of total judges of all other circuits, as demonstrated by Exhibit 7 on page 27. By population, also, our circuit dwarfs all others. More than 58 million people, almost exactly one-fifth of the entire population of the United States, live within our circuit. And the caseload is killing us. Even with the lumbering number of judges on our circuit, we can hardly keep up with the immense breadth and scope of our circuit's caseload. As you can see from Exhibit 12 on page 32, the Ninth Circuit has 6,000 more filings in 2005 than the next busiest circuit, and at 15,600 appeals, the Ninth Circuit had more than triple the average number of appeals filed of all circuits in 2005. Sadly, this caseload has taken its toll on the litigants within our circuit. Looking at Exhibit 16 on page 36, the Ninth Circuit is now, regrettably, the slowest circuit in the disposition of appeals. And the numbers on Exhibit 17 show that the Ninth Circuit takes 40 percent longer to dispose of its appeals than the average of other circuits, although you will probably hear from some of my colleagues, which is absolutely true, that we have a very good record in terms of disposing of cases. Once the case gets to argument until it is decided, we probably have one of the best records in the country. But the problem is getting it from a notice of appeal to the scheduling it for oral argument and that is what the fundamental problem is. So no matter what metric one uses, the Ninth Circuit dominates out of all proportion to the structure of the rest of the Federal judicial system. From any reasonable perspective, the Ninth Circuit already equals at least two circuits in one. Now, I am not alone in my conclusions. Several Supreme Court Justices have commented-- Chairman Sessions. Judge O'Scannlain, I think I failed to start you off on time, so you have had an extra minute or so and-- Judge O'Scannlain. Oh, OK. Chairman Sessions. I guess one of the pleasures of a lawyer is to be able to cutoff a judge, having the light go off. Judge O'Scannlain. All right. [Laughter.] Chairman Sessions. That is a very rare privilege, but anyway, if you would just wrap up so we can give everybody a similar amount of time. Judge O'Scannlain. All right, Mr. Chairman. I submit to you that the tide has now turned and the burden of persuasion has plainly shifted. Indeed, the whole paradigm has shifted. As long as one accepts the underlying premise of the appellate circuits in the first place that discrete decisionmaking units provide absolute benefits to the administration of justice, there is no denying that the Ninth Circuit must be reorganized. I challenge any opponent of reorganization to articulate a reasonable justification for placing one-fifth of our citizens, one-fifth of the entire Federal appellate judiciary, and one- fifth of all of the appeals filed by all of the Federal litigants into this country into one of 12 regional circuits. In closing, let me say that Chief Judge Schroeder and her predecessors have done a truly admirable job with the limited tools that they have had, chipping away at the mounting challenges to efficient judicial administration. However, I do not believe that long-term solutions to long-term problems come from tinkering at the edges. The time has come when cosmetic changes can no longer suffice and a significant restructuring is necessary. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will be very happy to take questions at the appropriate time. [The prepared statement of Judge O'Scannlain appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Sessions. Thank you. Judge Tallman? STATEMENT OF RICHARD C. TALLMAN, CIRCUIT JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON Judge Tallman. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Subcommittee. My name is Richard C. Tallman. I am a United States Circuit Judge with chambers in Seattle. Thank you for the invitation to appear here this afternoon to discuss why the reorganization of our court is overdue to bring about a new era of judicial efficiency in the circuit courts of the Western United States. I join eight other circuit judges on our court who are listed in Footnote 1 of my written testimony who also support a split, and Mr. Chairman, I would ask that that written testimony be made a part of the record. Chairman Sessions. We will make that a part of the record. Judge Tallman. I can also say that there are other judges on our court who support reorganization but who prefer, for various reasons, not to identify themselves. Mr. Chairman, the statistical evidence is overwhelming. Unmentioned in the previous numbers is the fact that we are forced to borrow visiting circuit and district judges from all over the United States. In this year alone, we brought in 137 visitors. Next year, we expect around 200. That has an impact on the development of the jurisprudence in the Ninth Circuit. That is in addition to the 51 active and senior circuit judges who continue to hear cases on the Ninth. We should not be deterred by overstated arguments of short- term financial costs. Instead, we should view the cost of splitting the court as a necessary investment which will pay great dividends in the delivery of justice to the people we serve. If Congress prefers a two-way split, the most readily available, cost effective, and geographically desirable location for the 12th Circuit's headquarters is the now empty ten-story William K. Nakamura United States Courthouse located at 1010 Fifth Avenue in Seattle, Washington. It is pictured in Exhibit 1 and is up on the chart. This building, rich in history, where many great men and women have served our Nation, is the perfect building to begin a new era in our reorganized judiciary, and Senator Feinstein, we can lop off $84 million from the AO's letter that you just marked in the record by using the Nakamura Courthouse. Congress has already approved the $53 million in renovation costs and that work is underway by the General Services Administration. That building, with 104,000 usable square feet, is more than adequate to physically house the judges' chambers, the courtrooms, and all of the clerks and administrative space for the new 12th Circuit with plenty of room for future growth. The architectural drawings for its renovated courtrooms are shown in Exhibits 3 and 4 to my testimony. That is a typical three-judge panel hearing room, and the next one is the en banc courtroom which is designed and will be built out to handle 15 judges so that the full court could sit en banc. Congress has already approved the $53 million in repairs and renovation costs in GSA's budget for fiscal year 2005 and preparing it to serve as the headquarters for the 12th Circuit will not add excessive work or cost to the ongoing renovation. Most importantly, the renovation work will be completed in plenty of time to allow the 12th Circuit to begin operations, hear oral arguments, and carry out other judicial functions upon the effective date of the split. Seattle is centrally located for the States that would make up the 12th Circuit. That is a substantial cost to taxpayers in lieu of having current Ninth Circuit judges and staff regularly travel these great distances. Flights to and from Seattle are more convenient, more frequent, would be shorter in duration, and are less expensive, allowing for cost savings, less time wasted in airports, and more time spent in chambers handling appellate work. If Congress prefers another Pacific Northwest location, the Gus Solomon U.S. Courthouse in Portland, Oregon, stands ready to answer the call. It is shown in Exhibit 5 to my testimony, another empty, available courthouse. With these existing facilities, it is clear that we do not need to build new courthouses. We also ought to try to avoid arrangements in which the new circuit headquarters would be housed in separate buildings within the same city. Either Nakamura or Solomon can do the job in one building. Because California is producing 70 percent of the Ninth Circuit's 16,000 cases, a substantial amount of time and money is spent sending judges from outside the Golden State to hear cases in California, while California judges travel to hear cases in other States of the Ninth Circuit. This past year, I heard cases in Seattle for only five days for the entire year. It is wasteful to pay judges to play this game of judicial musical chairs, traveling to one another's States when the job could easily be done by local judges working at their home duty stations. By adding new judges in California and splitting many of the current Ninth Circuit States into the 12th Circuit, all judges will spend less time traveling and more time working on cases within their own State or States closer in proximity. Those are real cost savings of millions of dollars annually and countless hours of travel. With or without a split, it is absolutely necessary to add additional judgeships in California and fill empty seats already authorized, but it is unfair to attribute the cost of doing so to the cost of splitting the Ninth Circuit. Those judges are needed now. We have to address this growth problem, which is rapidly growing and getting worse by the day. The startup costs have been inflated in past discussions because it was assumed that brand new courthouses would have to be constructed. Nor was there any offsetting credit based on the financial gain from cost savings resulting from separating the States and enjoying judicial resources closer to home. The transaction costs of investing in improving the delivery of justice are far less than the opportunity costs of simply maintaining the status quo. That is unacceptable. Justice delayed is justice denied. It is hard to quantify the benefits of speedier resolution of appeals, which will surely follow the creation of more manageable, smaller appellate courts. In the end, our citizens, both as taxpayers and consumers of our court services, will greatly benefit from the a split of the Ninth Circuit. It will provide them with better service, litigants with prompt decisions, and a full en banc review of the most important cases to reach the court. The time is now to make the investment in improving the delivery of justice in the Western United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Judge Tallman appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Sessions. Thank you, Judge Tallman. Chief Judge Mary Schroeder, we are delighted to have you here again and look forward to hearing from you. STATEMENT OF MARY M. SCHROEDER, CHIEF JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, PHOENIX, ARIZONA Judge Schroeder. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon. My name is Mary Schroeder and I am the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I am very pleased to be with you. My husband is a little less enthusiastic about my being here-- [Laughter.] Judge Schroeder [continuing]. But I hope to join him later in the day. I have served in the capacity of Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit since December of 2000. My home chambers are in Phoenix, Arizona, and Senator Kyl and I practiced law together in Phoenix at the same time and we have been together on many projects for a long time. I would like to introduce our colleague, Carlos Bea. Judge Bea and his wife, Lucille, are here from San Francisco, and our wonderful Clerk of Court, Cathy Catterson, who is also here today. I notice that the Clerk of Court of the District of Arizona is also here, Rich Weir. As you know, technology has improved rapidly. We now have BlackBerrys, we have cell phones, laptops. We can communicate instantly with each other wherever we are on the planet. It is now easier to administer this circuit than it was when I took over as Chief in 2000. Moreover, it is the view of the overwhelming majority of our circuit judges, bankruptcy judges, and the lawyers who practice within the circuit that a division of the circuit would not improve the administration of justice in the West. We are not just talking about the Court of Appeals. We are talking about the entire circuit and this includes magistrate judges, district judges, everyone. There are only three active circuit judges who support division and they are all here today and you will hear from them. What I would like to focus upon this afternoon, however, is not how well the circuit is operating but how harmful a circuit division would be, especially now. There are three principal reasons. The first is the unprecedented devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, which the AO has already asked for $65 million in additional appropriation. The second is the temporary but unprecedented increase in immigration appeals to our court from the Board of Immigration Appeals in the Justice Department that cannot provide sufficient meaningful administrative review, and we hope to work with them so that they get the resources that they need, as well. The third reason that this is such a bad time to consider splitting the circuit is the need for court resources to prepare for new litigation spawned by the Bankruptcy Act that went into effect last week and new immigration legislation that you are struggling to formulate, and we would like to work with you to make sure that whatever policies you come up with in the immigration field work. I was in Houston after Katrina last week and their circuit executive's offices in rented space, their clerk's office on rented furniture, their entire clerk's office, 100 people, is on per diem and working in Houston. They are worried about their children, their homes, and what the future will bring. The Federal Appellate Court for the Fifth Circuit is at least functioning, thanks to those efforts of the Chief Judge and its administrators, but I understand there are trial courts there that are not functioning at all. We don't think this is the time to create an unnecessary and costly bureaucratic court structure in the West, especially when there is no legal system in one area of the country right now. With respect to the immigration case deluge, those cases are nearly all from California. Splitting the circuit would exacerbate administrative burdens because the judges from the rest of the circuit would no longer be there to help and staff resources would be cut. The Judicial Conference of the U.S. has taken a position of neutrality with respect to the merits of the split. That has always been the position. They have never taken a position in favor of circuit splitting or opposed. They do oppose linking new judgeships to the issue of circuit splitting. Let me speak for a moment about staffing. The new Circuit Court of Appeals has to be staffed and a new circuit has to be staffed. They would need a clerk of court, circuit executive, technology folks, staff attorneys. We have all of that now very effectively in the Ninth Circuit and we have services that are not matched because of the expertise that we are able to provide in a circuit executive's office and a clerk's office that serve a lot of folks out there. Finally, about administration, the existing circuit has a hub. It is easily administered because nearly all of the judges can get to San Francisco within 2 hours and they don't have to lose more than a day in the office. I happen to follow college athletics and the headquarters of the PAC 10 and the Ninth Circuit are within seven BART stops from each other because that is the hub of that area of the lower 48, and when Hawaii and Alaska were added, they were added to the Ninth Circuit. Nobody thought a thing because there was nowhere else for them to go and I don't think there is now. Neither of the circuits that were created by S. 1845 would have such a hub. One would cover the whole Pacific and the other would stretch from the border of Mexico to the Arctic Circle. Judges would have to change planes in San Francisco in order to get from Phoenix to Seattle. So the courthouse in Phoenix, we can look at, but it is fully occupied and it has ten courtrooms. You would have to fill in those courtrooms-- that is very, very expensive--and move the bankruptcy court out. So given the stress on the administration of justice right now by all of the things we are seeing, all of the movement in this country, fracturing the administrative structure of the courts of the West is not a good idea. I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and I would be happy to answer any questions later. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Judge Schroeder appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Sessions. Thank you. Thank you, Chief Judge Schroeder. Judge Kozinski, it is a pleasure to have you with us and see you again. I am not uninterested in your comments and will be studying your record, but unless Senator Kyl is leaving--he just disappeared. I have to go vote in just a minute. Senator Kyl says that he would be pleased to preside, so we are delighted to hear from you at this time. STATEMENT OF ALEX KOZINSKI, CIRCUIT JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, PASADENA, CALIFORNIA Judge Kozinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Alex Kozinski. I am a judge on the Ninth Circuit. I have been a judge on the Ninth Circuit for 20 years. I am resident in Pasadena. I have written testimony and rather than summarizing it, which I planned to do, what I would like to do is address some points raised by the other witnesses, but partly because Senator Feinstein did such a fine job of saying most of the points that I did and there is no point repeating them here. On this matter of whether there is a consensus that the Ninth Circuit ought to be split, I think the Committee ought to think seriously about this. Who knows more about what is good for the people in the Ninth Circuit insofar as the Ninth Circuit is concerned than the lawyers, the people who represent the litigants who appear before us? I think it is significant. I think it is a fact that can't be brushed aside that the State bars of Arizona, Hawaii, and Montana have all voted against the split. These are States that would be split away from the Ninth Circuit, that would get the supposed benefits of a split, and yet the lawyers representing the litigants that appear before us are against the split. Also, the judges know quite a bit about this and I think the Committee ought to find it significant that of the judges on our court, there are only three active judges, who are all present, who voted in favor of a split. We had a court meeting. We had a discussion. We had a vote. Only three active judges, all present here, voted in favor of the split. It is significant that of the circuit judges from Montana, Arizona, Nevada, and Hawaii, there was not a single circuit judge, active or senior, who voted in favor of the split. Not a single judge from one of those States voted in favor of the split. Now, I heard Senator Ensign say to the contrary, that he believed that one of the circuit judges from Nevada voted differently. I have here a vote tally sheet of the vote we have taken. It includes the list of all the judges who voted for and against, who abstained. It shows that-- Chairman Sessions. Do we have a voting rights case here? [Laughter.] Judge Kozinski. Well, I think it is important, Senator, to have the record straight-- Chairman Sessions. Well, it is. Judge Kozinski. and the record is that the Judge Rawlinson from Las Vegas voted in favor of a split and Judge Hugg, former Chief Judge, a great Chief Judge, a wonderful Chief Judge, voted against the split and the two judges abstained. Judge Brunetti and Judge Bybee abstained. I am aware, as I stand here and I am under oath, I am aware of no colleague of mine from Nevada who voted--who believes that the split is appropriate. Now, these are judges and lawyers from the States that would be affected by the split, the split that supposedly is inevitable. I think the Committee ought to think very carefully about why those people most intimately familiar with it and those who are most involved with our litigation process have voted against the split. Now, Judge O'Scannlain raised, as well did the Chairman, the business about delay in deciding cases in the Ninth Circuit. Judge O'Scannlain, a fine colleague of mine, and Judge Tallman, a wonderful colleague--one of the worst things about this proposed split is I really would miss them, and Judge Kleinfeld. I really would hate to see them go, and I am going to hold on to them as hard as I can. But Judge O'Scannlain was quite fair. He said, oh, they will tell you that once the cases get to the judges, we are the fastest, one of the fastest courts in the country to decide. Well, isn't that the test of the circuit, of how the circuit is working? The reason cases are delayed is because we have four vacancies. Up until two or 3 years ago, we had eight vacancies and ten vacancies in our court. The reason we have visiting judges from other courts is we don't have the judges. Judges have not been confirmed. Once the cases get to the judges, once the judges get to decide the cases, once the decisionmaking process comes within our control, we are the second fastest court in the country. It doesn't matter that some of our colleagues are in Alaska and others are in Montana and others are in Hawaii because I can talk to Judge Kleinfeld and I can talk to Judge Thomas in Montana, I can talk to my colleague, Judge Clifton, in Honolulu by picking up the phone or by sending an e-mail, and you know what? E-mail to Montana is just as fast as e-mail to downtown Los Angeles, believe it or not. We are unified as a court and at no time in the history of the United States has a circuit court been split over the strong opposition of a majority of the judges. The only time that we know about is the Fifth Circuit was split when the judges unanimously voted to split. Now, I don't think we have a veto. I don't think we are entitled to deference in the sense that you can't do it. Of course, you can do it. It is your job to do it. But you need to think carefully about the people who actually deal with the lives and fortunes of the litigants before us, the judges and the lawyers, and the judges and the lawyers have spoken and by overwhelming margins they have said no. I think this Committee should accept that verdict, after close study, and should reject once and for all the proposals to split the Ninth Circuit, and what they should do is commend the court and help us with technology, help us with resources, help us here in the Senate with confirming our judges. Give us the judges to do the job for you. You do that and we are not going to see those numbers. We are going to see the fastest court in the country. Thank you, members of the Committee and--and Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Judge Kozinski appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Kyl. [Presiding.] Thank you. I don't mean to confuse things-- [Laughter.] Judge Kozinski. Excuse me, sir, I do have this vote tally sheet. I know in court we would say, may I have it marked as an exhibit-- Senator Kyl. Without objection. Any written material that any of you would like to have appear in the record will be included in the record. Since Senator Feinstein is ranking, Senator Feinstein, would you like to begin the questioning? Are you prepared? I will tell you what. Let me just ask one question first and then I will turn to you, how is that? It was occasioned by, Judge Kozinski, one of the comments you just made. I don't know why it takes the Ninth Circuit so long to get to oral argument. Your suggestion was, Judge Kozinski, that that was because there are four vacancies. On the other hand, isn't it possible to set oral argument and if there are two judges set and a third that has to be filled in, to simply fill it in with a visiting judge or district court judge? In other words, why should the fact that there are four vacancies mean that it takes a long time to get to oral argument? I don't understand that. And Judge Schroeder might be able to answer that, as well. Judge Kozinski. Since you directed the question to me, there is always a balance on a court between speed and getting the work done by bringing in more judges--being short of judges. Of course, there is not an unlimited number of visiting judges you can get. Other judges have their own work to do. But in terms of maintaining consistency in the law of the circuit, what you want to do is to have as many of the local judges, as many judges from the home circuit as possible because they see the same cases again and again. Now, the balance can be struck in various ways, but I believe it will be irresponsible for a court to promiscuously bring in visiting judges when there are vacancies. I think we try to do our job, but at the same time we don't want to muck up the law by having too many hands in the pot. Judge Schroeder. What we like to do is to bring in our own district judges who are familiar with the circuit law. It is not helpful particularly to bring in a lot of judges from other circuits who are not familiar with the circuit law. One of the things that came out in the White Commission hearings that they had in the late 1990's when they studied the circuit structure throughout the country was a dissatisfaction on the part of lawyers in some other parts of the country with some other circuits that relied more heavily on visiting judges than the Ninth Circuit does, because they would like to have the cases decided by those who are familiar with the law and not in Atlanta by a senior judge from Indiana. Senator Kyl. And, by the way, let me make it clear that if it were up to me, there wouldn't be any vacancies in any court, and, in fact, we would have more judges to be filled in the form of new judgeships, both district and circuit, but I don't control all of that and I understand that that is a deficiency. Do, Judge Tallman or Judge O'Scannlain, do you have a view on this question of why it takes so long to get to oral argument? Judge Tallman. I should say, and I think you can appreciate this as a former practicing lawyer, it doesn't matter to the litigants what the reasons are. All they know is that it takes 15.4 months on average to get their cases decided. We do have problems in immigration cases getting the record, the administrative record together, and that is a problem on the government's side of the equation. But we have got a whole basement full of pending court cases in San Francisco that are waiting for oral argument panels to become available to which they can be assigned and that takes more judges. To respond directly to Senator Feinstein's concerns expressed at the outset, Senator, there is no way to equalize the caseload with California unless the State itself is split and no one is advocating that. But none of the circuit caseloads are mathematically equal and there will always be variations from one to another. The logical result of the opposition argument is that there is no limit to the size to which this court may grow. Do we really want an appellate court of 75 active and senior circuit judges? That is not a court, it is a legislature. Senator Kyl. By the way, the senior judges are available for designation on panels to the extent that they devote time to judging, so I presume they are included within the panel? Judge Tallman. Technically, they are not designated. As a senior judge of the court, they continue to hear cases. They just hear a reduced caseload. Some of them are handling caseloads that are equal to or greater than an active judge. Judge Schroeder. We rely on them. Senator Kyl. Actually, my preliminary question has turned into a whole 5 minutes, but Judge O'Scannlain, do you want to conclude-- Judge O'Scannlain. I would just simply concur with my colleague, Judge Tallman, and suggest that that figure of 47 judges today, including seniors, includes 23 seniors, and if I am not mistaken, at least 20 or maybe even 22 of those 23 seniors are actively sitting on panels, so that if we were stuck with just the 28, we would be at a total loss. But from the standpoint of the litigant, it doesn't matter how fast we are, and I totally agree with Judge Tallman on this, in terms of deciding cases as long as his case is waiting. So the problem is that notwithstanding all of these vaunted programs that we have, especially, for example, the screening panel, ironically, the cases that get the quickest treatment in our court are the ones that have the least complex issues to deal with. Those sometimes get in and out within six or 8 months, compared to 15 months as an average, and we do that with a screening panel. But notwithstanding that, we are still the slowest court in the entire country and that is a statistic which cannot be gainsaid. Judge Kozinski. Senator, if I may just followup, my colleagues are absolutely right. It doesn't matter to the litigant why the delay is, but it certainly matters in figuring out the swiftness. If the problem is we don't have enough judges, then the solution is give us more judges. Splitting a circuit is not going to solve the problem that is created by the absence of judges. What it will do is exactly as Senator Feinstein pointed out, because the judges in the new proposed 12th Circuit would have a much lower caseload, yes, those cases would get their judges more quickly. But the cases in California and cases in Hawaii, and Senator Kyl, Senator Murkowski, you are representing the nation, not just your own State and I submit that it is not fair to have a solution that makes the problem of delay so much worse in important parts of the country in other States, Hawaii and California. The problem being created by lack of judges, give us the judges. That will solve the problem. Judge O'Scannlain. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kyl, if I can call you Mr. Chairman at the moment, there is a little disingenuousness going on here, if I may say so, and I say so with a certain amount of regret. But we had the opportunity in 1990, the last major judgeship bill, to ask for new judges. We were entitled by the numbers to close to ten, maybe actually ten new judges, and we asked for zero. So the fact that we don't have enough judges is to a certain extent a product of our own making. And at the very least, what this bill does is give us seven new judges. In my view, and I repeat what I shared with Senator Feinstein in our meeting, I think the number of seven judges for California is too low. I think California justifies significantly more than that. And the fact that we never asked for them until now, I think is unfortunate, to say the least. Senator Kyl. Let me just conclude this and then, Mr. Chairman, Senator Feinstein should probably have the next opportunity since I basically took your spot here by asking a question that opened a bit of a can of worms. But let me just conclude with my thoughts, because I think both sides in this debate make a good point. Judge Kozinski, I think you are absolutely right that it is critical that we fill all of the vacancies and, I believe, create new judgeships consistent with the caseload and fill those as well and that that can have the effect of reducing the time to argument. That, therefore, helps to relieve the pressure that has been building for a split. But I also agree with the proposition that carried to not a logical extreme, day after tomorrow, we are going to have how many judges on this court? That makes the argument that, for any semblance of collegiality and ability to conduct en banc hearings and the other things which make for an effective court, there is going to be a point at which we either have to have a very different view of what a circuit court is with 75 judges or agree that at some point there does have to be a split. So it seems to me that there is validity in both points that have been made here. Judge Kozinski. I hop I will have a chance to speak to you privately at some point on all of those issues. I will be happy to come back to Washington or to Arizona to do that. Senator Kyl. Let us do it in Arizona. I said before, I view this as not perhaps the beginning of a conversation, but the continuation of a conversation that is going to take us a while. Everyone can breathe easy that this isn't going to pass tomorrow in exactly this form and there is plenty of time for conversation and I welcome, and I really do again appreciate the time that all of you have put in and the difficulty that it has created for some of you. Judge Schroeder. May I say, Senator, that Judge Thomas will also address these issues that you are concerned about. Senator Feinstein. I am not going to ask a formal question. Let me just for a moment have a bit of a discussion. I think there is more actually underlying this than just, well, let us shorten the time that a case can get to a judge because that is pretty simple, as Judge Kozinski pointed out. Increase the number of judges. The fact of the matter is, it has been increasingly difficult to get new judge positions to the Ninth Circuit, and the fact of the matter is, I believe, and I can't make any accusations, but I believe that there is an effort to starve the circuit to bring it to the point of a split. The points I have been trying to make is the very real need for parity in caseload. I think there are political reasons here. People say they aren't. I believe there are. Clearly, there are travel reasons. Some judges, I guess, don't want to travel as much, and I can understand that and I don't blame you for it. I am not at all critical. But I don't think the case should be made on the timeliness or the delay in getting the case, because if that is really the argument, then get the judges. When it comes to judges being active in lobbying, and I say this to both sides, nobody helps, really. The Chief Judge does, but that is somewhat limited. But while we are judges, we don't lobby is kind of the answer that comes back. Consequently, the Ninth Circuit has been seriously disadvantaged. Now, any split--I told you, 72 percent of the caseload remains in California and the rest of it, I mean, if you look at the actual numbers, they are de minimis. I won't do Guam. Hawaii, 247 cases are filed in a year. Alaska, 136 cases. that is all. Arizona, 1,195. Idaho, 161. Montana, 355. Nevada, 827. Oregon, 638. Washington, 1,130. So the big States of those are Washington and Arizona. But California, 10,985 cases. Therefore, it seems to me that a decision has to be made whether there is enough, and I can't answer this because I don't know, judicial interest in having the kind of cosmopolitan Western circuit that exists there with interaction for trade laws, kind of a richness of law because of the geographical composition of the circuit, or if not, I mean, if California could get 21 new judges on the line and be its own circuit, we could try and see how that would work. Judge O'Scannlain. Well, there is precedent for--if you look at Judge O'Scannlain's Exhibit 1, back at the beginning days of the republic, there was a United States Court of Appeals for the California Circuit and it-- Senator Feinstein. I saw it, but it didn't last long. Judge O'Scannlain. No, because the West grew and there needed to be more judges. Senator Feinstein. It grew and there was a synthesis of interests within the States. And as you know, no circuit except for the D.C. Circuit is less than three States. So the circuits have been devised on the basis that a number of States together is a good thing. So the question of size, in my view, is strictly related to numbers of judges. Go ahead, take me on. I am happy for you to take it on. Judge O'Scannlain. I would have to say that on this particular point, maybe Judge Kozinski, you, Senator, and I are in total agreement, and that is we need more judges. I certainly feel that very strongly. I thought we needed them in 1990 when we failed to ask for them, but we need them certainly today. The problem is, how large can a court of appeals grow and still be a court of appeals? That is the nub of it. And if you read the White Commission report of 1998, that is the central piece they make. They recommended that we split into three separate divisions. Keep the circuit structure, but split into three semi-autonomous divisions, one of which would--well, two of which would split California. Now, I realize, Senator, that you have some concerns about the optics of that and-- Senator Feinstein. Forum shopping, yes. Judge O'Scannlain. And that is a very respectable point and one which I share, as well. But the key here is that if we are looking at some modifications to this bill, in my personal view, I think the new 12th Circuit gets too many judges and the new Ninth does not get enough. So even with 35 judges to be reallocated, I think you could pick up two more judges just by shifting from the 12th to the Ninth in this bill, and then, as I said in my earlier testimony, I think you could justify ten or more judges at least to go with the number of California judges there are. So I think--but I think that is just a matter of adjustment. The principle, though, is the key, and the principle is you cannot let a court of appeals grow so large that the number of judges sitting around making law--now, we are not talking about making law in a legislative sense, in which there are much less limitations, but here, we have to speak as a unifying body which declares the law. The White Commission recommended nine to 17 as the ideal range. Over 17, it becomes cumbersome. We are at 28. If we go to 35 or 38 or 45 or 55, it is impossible and we cannot function as a court of appeals with that number. Senator Feinstein. Does everybody agree that if you grow like that, it is impossible? Judge-- Judge Schroeder. No. No. Senator Feinstein. Wait. Judge Schroeder, just a second. I will go down the line. Judge Tallman? Judge Tallman. I do agree with that, and it gets back to what we talked about at the last hearing, which is the importance of maintaining consistency and predictability in the law. The problem that we have now with 50 judges resident, active and senior, and 150 to 200 visiting judges is that it is like going to Las Vegas in terms of what the outcome is going to be. Tell me who the three judges are going to be on the panel and I might be able to predict how that particular panel is going to go. That is not supposed to be the way circuit courts of appeal operate. They are supposed to apply the same legal principles, the same body of law to similar sets of facts that come before them, and the en banc process exists to correct those panels who wander off the reservation because they didn't follow the law. With a court of 75 judges trying to have a functioning en banc process, even on a limited basis as we do now in the Ninth Circuit, would be virtually impossible. You are talking about the ability to review less than 3 percent now with the limited en banc process of errant cases that have gone awry. You couldn't do it with a court of 25,000 cases and 75 judges. Senator Feinstein. Judge Schroeder? Judge Schroeder. I am not sure why we are talking about 75 judges when we have never had the 28 for more than five minutes, but the truth is that it used to be that nine judges was considered the ideal size of a court. Now, all the circuits except the First are larger than nine. We have seen by technology that it is easier to operate when you have larger courts as we get bigger in our ability to communicate. You referenced the community of interest of the West. That is very important. We have a community of interest in the West. We have Microsoft, for example, in Seattle. We have the Silicon Valley. We have Intel. All of these are looking toward the Pacific. We all think of ourselves as Pacific Rim. We need to keep that community together. It is very important. And we will, if we ever get to 35 or 40 judges and it turns out that there are problems, we will deal with them. But no one has ever, in studying the circuit, has ever concluded that it would be more efficient to divide the circuit. Senator Feinstein. Judge Kozinski? Judge Kozinski. Well, it seems to me Judge O'Scannlain is giving up the game. He favors a split, but he says, oh, California should get ten more judges. Well, under the CCARMA bill, it is 16 judges plus he said we should get two more. That is 18. Ten more is 28. We are back at 28 active judges. Now, it seems to me the reality is we are all getting bigger. The country is getting bigger. Courts are getting bigger. Cases are getting bigger. Litigation is getting bigger. Simply throwing out--and law firms are getting bigger. Simply throwing out a number, saying, oh, 75 is a very big number, you know, ten judges was a very big number for a circuit in 1960. There was not a single circuit in the country that had as many as ten judges. It was horrible, the very though. I remember 1960 and I am sure-- Senator Feinstein. I do, too. Judge Kozinski. There we go. It was not such a long time ago. We live in a different world. And just to answer the question that Senator Kyl asked and the thing I want to talk to him about in his office when I get a chance, yes, you can run a court with 75 judges. It is not ideal, but it is done and this bill is about collegiality. I love my colleagues. I get along well with my colleagues. We josh around here. But as I say to Judge Tallman every time I see him, I say, you bad guy. Do I not say that to you? Judge Tallman. You do. Judge Kozinski. And the reason I say, you bad guy, is because he wants to leave me and I don't want to lose him. Judge Schroeder. Well, he is-- Judge Kozinski. And that is how we relate to each other. Senator Feinstein. Let me just say one thing about justice. I am not a lawyer, so it is easy for me to say. But it seems to me that--I have always thought, to some extent, small is better because small is human. Judge Schroeder, I have a problem with doing things by BlackBerrys, probably because I am not of the generation, really. For me, it is the human interaction. It is the ability to take the time. It is having people feel really satisfied that they had their justice and that it was human, that it wasn't mechanical, and that cases weren't just sorted in bulk and dealt with in bulk and that kind of thing, that there was an individual quality to the justice that is meted out. I do think that as a circuit gets bigger, if this one is going to continue to grow, it is inevitable that 1 day, we are going to be there. I don't pretend to know what is the size when we are going to be there, but for me, as I look at this and try to see the forest for the trees, it is parity. It is bringing down the number of cases per judge so that the individual case has a certain prominence and isn't just in a batch that is dispensed with in a certain way. Judge Schroeder. I don't disagree with that at all, but as you have pointed out, the reality is that California is very large and that it is going to have to have a certain number of judges and that any circuit with California is going to be larger than 20 judges. That is just the reality of the world in which we live. Judge O'Scannlain. Perhaps, Senator Feinstein, the time has come to give some consideration, I am not sure where I would stand on it personally, but some serious consideration to the rule that we kind of followed, an unwritten rule that there has to be three states to make a circuit. The District of Columbia is an exception to that rule, but that didn't occur until 1948. Maybe because of the population pressures of California, the time has come to consider whether California, like it was in 1855, should once again become its own circuit. Certainly, the numbers in every way justify it. I am not suggesting that as a solution here, but I am suggesting that we have to do something with these numbers because these are pressures which need a response. Senator Feinstein. I haven't seen a proposal that treats California fairly in terms of judges, candidly. Judge O'Scannlain. OK. Senator Feinstein. Clearly, it knocks down the caseload to, like, 325 for the other States per judge with the judges that accompany the proposals, but it leaves California judges with over 500 cases. I can't-- Judge Tallman. Mr. Chairman, Senator, I think you are overlooking the fact that the bills also provide for continuing exchanges of circuit judges between the 12th and the Ninth to address that problem. We will continue to be sitting in California for some time to come as the bills are currently drafted. Senator Feinstein. Then what is the point of doing it? [Laughter.] Judge Tallman. Because at some point, the thought was that California would get the additional permanent judgeships that it needs so that you wouldn't need to be borrowing all these judges from the rest of the country. Senator Feinstein. Let me just say, I have been here now for almost 13 years. I don't think California will get the judges it needs. The only way for California to get the judges it needs is to get them before there is any split and have them, because I think California will be slighted, and I greatly respect Senator Murkowski. I think she does a super job. We serve together on Energy and Water. But the proposal doesn't treat California fairly in terms of number--I leave out the word ``fairly,'' but doesn't treat California adequately in terms of the number of judges and I have to fight for my State. Judge Kozinski. Mr. Chairman, may I just have 30 seconds to address this. Judge O'Scannlain put in this idea of a single State circuit for the first time and I just want to address it. There has been a philosophy in the Federal courts, and it is a very important philosophy and this Committee ought not to reconsider it lightly or casually or on an ad hoc basis. The idea is that trial courts, trial courts, for very good reasons, trial courts tend to be local. The judges are drawn from the local community. They have the approval of the local senators or the State senators. Appellate courts in this country in the Federal system have been regional and national, regional for the circuits, national for the United States Supreme Court. It is a very important principle that ought not to be slighted or overlooked, and that is that you have regional interests in the application of facts, but when it comes to application of the law, you want regional consistency and you do want views from outside the State. I am very happy when Judge Kleinfeld comes and sits on California cases or when Judge Thomas does and our colleagues from Arizona. It is very important to have that and to continue with that. A single State circuit would go contrary to that long-established principle. I would beg this Committee not to do so without a very careful thought to it. Chairman Sessions. [Presiding.] Well, it is a big circuit. California is a big State. Some call it a nation-state. It is further from San Diego to San Francisco than it is from Mobile to Atlanta, and maybe further culturally, I don't know. We have got a whole bunch of circuits on the East Coast. We have got several on the Gulf Coast. I think these things don't make much sense to me, frankly. I think it is just angst. There was a lot of angst when they split the Fifth Circuit. It went on, every kind of fear and concern, voting rights were going to be denied, it was just awful, but somehow, it was done and everybody is so happy. Look at these numbers, Senator Feinstein. Now, I know this is a busy circuit. It has got 6,000 immigration cases. But trust me, an immigration case is not as big as a multi- defendant conspiracy cocaine case or an antitrust case. Those can be handled in a larger number. But even then, the existing caseload per judge that is being handled is not the highest. The Ninth handles 560 per judge, which is large, but the 11th has 642. The Fifth has 567. And the Second has 524, and that is as of June 2005 from the Administrative Office of the Courts statistics. True, some others, you say that the 12th would not have that many judges, but it would be about 326, I believe. But here, the First Circuit has 314 per judge. The Third, 307. The Fourth, 355. The Sixth, 316. The Seventh, 337. The Eighth, 322. And the D.C. Circuit, which I have been trying to take a judge from-- [Laughter.] Chairman Sessions [continuing]. Has 114, but they act like the roof is going to fall if you take one of their judges, but they only have 114 per judge and you have 560. But they say theirs are big cases. But anyway, so I think the numbers are important here. But I have-- Judge O'Scannlain. Mr. Chairman, if I could just make one point with respect to that, and that is that perhaps the most successful circuit of all is your circuit, the 11th Circuit, which has the highest number of cases per judge. They have made the decision, they do not want additional judges because they feel to do so would be to affect their decisionmaking ability and to create precisely the kinds of problems we have been hearing about during this hearing. So they have elected to stay at whatever it is, 12 or 13 or something like that, and yet take a huge burden, which, God bless them, they do a terrific job. They have all of the same bells and whistles that we do, pretty much. There are differences, of course. But they are a much more efficient circuit than we are and their backlog, or at least their lag time, isn't as bad. I am glad you pointed out the disparity between the circuits, which run from 100-and-something to well over 600. The key to me when I hear all of that is that the 11th Circuit can do it with fewer judges and be very effective. Chairman Sessions. I know there perhaps have been ideological and judicial philosophy concerns about the Ninth Circuit. We know it is the most reversed circuit in the country. I think some of the reasons for that is not ideological, but as I think some of you suggested, these panels of three being selected out of a very large number, you have more likelihood of an aberrant panel than you would in a smaller court, perhaps. But at any rate, I am concerned about the size of this court. I think 28 judges is breathtaking. I would note that the bill that has been proposed would add seven new judges to the old Ninth Circuit and add no new judges to the 12th. So all the new judges in their proposal, which should be a pretty noticeable increase in judges and at least keep those caseload numbers more reasonable, perhaps, than they are today. I want to discuss this question of whether we are dealing with a court or the House of Lords. [Laughter.] Chairman Sessions. I mean, to have an en banc that 28, 35, 51--well, 51 judges counting the senior judges, but an en banc, you would just have, say, 28 if you were fully stocked in the Ninth, would you share with me--I think, Judge O'Scannlain, you wrote, or was it you, Judge Tallman, that emphasized that most--the practical problems of maintaining uniformity, maybe the psychological pressures on judges to try to conform to a circuit that they can identify with, how that is impacted as you get larger and larger? Judge Tallman. Mr. Chairman, you are recalling, I think, both my oral and my written testimony from the April 2004 hearing, where I laid out the case for why the limited en banc process has not worked very well. I know Judge Roll is prepared to address that in his testimony, as well. But there certainly is a practical limit to how many judges can effectively hear a case en banc. We are now, as you know, going to experiment starting January 1 with 15 judges, which I understand is about what the Fifth does when they sit en banc, but I also understand, and I believe Judge Tjoflat touched on this when he testified in April of 2004 that that was one of the deciding factors that pushed the judges of the old Fifth into agreeing that it was time to divide. They had an en banc hearing with 25, I think it was at that time, and it was just unmanageable. It was too many judges to try and wrestle with the issue effectively. Chairman Sessions. Perhaps-- Judge Schroeder. Could I just respond? Chairman Sessions. I will say this, and then I will recognize you, that I am not aware in the Western world of a court this big, in the Western heritage of law that we have a court this big. It ceases--I think the question is, is it a court anymore? Is it just a vote, you know, some sort of who can get the most votes in this big to-do? So I think that is a legitimate concern. Chief Justice Schroeder, I will hear from you and then we will go to Senator Murkowski. Judge Schroeder. I just wanted to respond briefly with respect to size that we should keep this in perspective. There are fewer judges in the entire Ninth Circuit than there are in the State court system of Arizona. The former Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court has testified previously--he was not Chief Justice at the time, but in opposition to a split of the circuit because in relation to other court systems in the court, we are not that big. Chairman Sessions. The Supreme Court of Arizona? J"
