        "text": "Paul Gaines Sr. Achievement Award\n\nPaul Gaines Sr., G’68 was the first appointed Minority Affairs Director at Bridgewater State College (1968-1995). He was the pioneer in hiring professors, administrators, and staff of color along with the recruitment of students of color on the Bridgewater campus. He was instrumental in founding both the Organization of Afro-American Students (later named the Afro-Am Society), and the Afro-American Alumni Association.\n\nThis award is presented to a current faculty, administrator, library, or staff member, who has been employed at least one year at Bridgewater State University and has worked on behalf of students of color. The nominee must demonstrate a deep commitment in the growth and retention of students of color and must also support the Afro-American Alumni Association through programming and/or events.\n\n2022 Award Recipients: Dr. Emily Field and Dr. Jamie Huff\n\nArtemas Hale Meritorious Service Award\n\nIt is thanks primarily to Artemis Hale that the town of Bridgewater is home to Bridgewater State University, rather than in Plymouth or Middleborough — its chief competitors — because of his advocacy on behalf of his adopted hometown (he had been born in Winchendon, Massachusetts but lived most of his 98 years in Bridgewater).\n\nMr. Hale's successful efforts to persuade state officials about where in southeastern Massachusetts to locate the Commonwealth's first school to prepare teachers was so decisive that he was, in the words of Dr, Jordan Fiore, class of 1940, faculty member and dean of his alma mater and a renowned historian, the university's \"first friend.\"\n\nIn 1838 Mr. Hale had been chosen as president of a state-sponsored committee to choose a site for the region's first school to prepare teachers for the public schools (prior to this, no special training or qualifications to teach were required in Massachusetts).\n\nBy that time Mr. Hale was already a leading public figure, having been elected to represent Bridgewater for terms in the state's House of Representatives and its State Senate. Later he would be elected to serve in the U.S Congress.\n\nIn the process of choosing where the new school would be located, he advocated strenuously that Bridgewater be selected and based largely on his efforts, on September 9, 1840, then-Bridgewater Normal School opened its doors to admit its first class of 28 students.\n\nBeyond his influence in promoting Bridgewater as the home of the first Normal School in the region he was also instrumental in a campaign to help raise the funds necessary to establish in 1846 a permanent home for the school, the first building in America created for the preparation of teachers.\n\nThis award is presented to a non-alumnus/friend of the University who has demonstrated a deep dedication to the University through their contribution of time, talents or financial resources. The recipient should have displayed uncommon loyalty and support to Bridgewater State.\n\nNicholas P. Tillinghast Award for Achievement in the Field of Public Education\n\nThis award was named in honor of the university's first president (then called \"headmaster\") who served in this pioneering post from 1840-1853. He sought to give his students the principles of education, so that they might be able to practice the art of teaching in the education of children. He gave the whole energy of his soul to the work which was given him to accomplish and establish the school upon a deep and broad foundation.\n\nThe award honors a distinguished Bridgewater alumnus/na who has demonstrated the qualities of outstanding leadership, excellence in performance and outstanding personal achievement in the field of public education at the state, regional or national level.\n\n2022 Award Recipient: Hazel L. Varella ’54, G’56\n\nDr. George A. Weygand, '53, G'56, Award for Outstanding Service to the BAA\n\nProfessor George Weygand, ’53, G ‘56, understood that physics is everywhere. And he brought that practical, student-focused approach to the classroom, even inspiring those who thought they would struggle with the subject,” wrote Brian Benson, G ‘23, in a profile of Dr. Weygand when a new residence hall at BSU opened in 2013, named in his honor.\n\nA veteran of World War II, where he saw extensive combat in Europe, he came to then-Bridgewater State Teachers College September, 1949, where he would go on to earn his bachelor’s degree - he was the president of his graduating class - and master’s degrees plus serve for four decades as a distinguished member of the faculty. He left Bridgewater only to study for a doctorate in physics at Harvard University.\n\n“I love to teach. That is what gets me going every day,” he said in a 1997 article about being named Science Educator of the Year by the Massachusetts Association of Science Teachers.\n\nDr. Weygand excelled at teaching from a practical point of view and making concepts relevant to students, who often took his classes while pursuing a degree in a different subject.\n\nIn a dedication to Dr. Weygand published in the 1999 yearbook, then President Adrian Tinsley noted that Dr, Weygand was one of the few faculty members to amass such a lengthy record of service.\n\n“It would be safe to say that even fewer have attained the level of affection and respect associated with Dr. Weygand’s name,” Dr. Tinsley wrote. “His service to the college as a whole and to students in particular has been extraordinary. He is a remarkable teacher with a national reputation for excellence in the teaching of physics, and he is an equally remarkable human being who has devoted his career to Bridgewater State College.”\n\nIn addition to all of his other services to his alma mater, Dr. Weygand served as a Faculty Marshal for more than three decades where he officiated at all university ceremonies, marching at the head of his faculty colleagues at Fall Convocation and Spring Commencement.\n\nThis award is presented to a distinguished alumnus/na who demonstrates generosity and places a high priority on service to create a legacy for future generations of alumni. Qualifications for this award include the ability to build understanding and awareness through alumni association involvement and leadership.\n\n2022 Award Recipient: Matthew J. Quimby ’04, G’07"
