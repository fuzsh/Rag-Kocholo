        "text": "SAN DIEGO — U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson Jr., the San Diego federal court’s longest-serving judge who was perhaps best known for presiding over the Mount Soledad cross case, died Sunday of cancer. He was 85.\n\nThompson, who was appointed to the federal bench by then-President Richard Nixon in 1970, presided over cases until shortly before his death, Chief U.S. District Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz said in a statement.\n\nHe was a no-nonsense jurist who pushed his own personal beliefs and public opinion aside and ruled on the law, said fellow judges, friends and family.\n\n“He never made a single decision on that bench he didn’t think was right,” said his oldest son, San Diego Superior Court Judge John Thompson. “… He was really great at keeping himself above the fray.”\n\nThompson gained notoriety for his 1991 ruling that deemed the Mount Soledad cross unconstitutional and ordered it to be moved from public land. He continued to preside over the contentious case for years, managing its various twists and turns. (More than two decade later, the cross remains in its same spot and is still the subject of controversy.)\n\nThe case made him a polarizing figure, but those who knew him closely said the barbs accusing him of being a “liberal judge” or “activist” were undeserved.\n\n“He was a family man, he was a religious man, he believed in the values of America,” said Peter Nuñez, who was the judge’s first law clerk in 1970 and eventually rose to be U.S. Attorney in San Diego from 1982 to 1988. “I think when he made those decisions in the cross case, to some degree it was contradictory to what his personal beliefs might have been, but it demonstrated courage and commitment to do what he thought the law required.”\n\nThompson also drew national attention in 1982 when he sent a draft resister to prison, the first judge to do so since the Vietnam War era. He gave then-Vista resident Benjamin Sasway 30 months in behind bars for refusing to register with the Selective Service System.\n\nU.S. District Judge Marilyn L. Huff said Thompson “leaves a legacy of respect for the rule of law. I will miss his fierce independence, his cheery smile and his friendship.”\n\nThe Southern District court “has lost one of its greatest and yet another of the Greatest Generation,” said U.S. District Judge Jeffrey T. Miller.\n\nNuñez remembered Thompson as a judge who liked to move cases along without delay, and was friendly and informal with his staff off the bench.\n\n“He relied on the law clerks throughout his career. He never made you feel like you were some functionary in his staff,” said Nuñez, who is now retired and does government contract work.\n\nHe was innovative, not afraid to do things a new way if he thought it was better.\n\nOne example occurred shortly after he took the bench. Thompson suggested his bailiff, a third-year law student, become his second law clerk, and found research that stated judges were entitled to have two clerks if they wanted.\n\n“Within a year, all the judges had two law clerks,” Nuñez remembered.\n\nHe also went somewhat against the traditional view and occasionally allowed polygraph evidence into cases.\n\n“What made him better than others is he didn’t let the law overcome his sense of decency and common sense,” Nuñez said. “What I learned from him is common sense still has a role in the legal profession.”\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Chris Tenorio made hundreds of appearances in Thompson’s courtroom for over 20 years, both as a federal defender and prosecutor, and tried his first case there.\n\n“I always found Judge Thompson to be an uncompromised public servant whose passion and dedication to the rule of law never wavered,” Tenorio said. “It was an honor to practice before such a stalwart of San Diego and judicial history.”\n\nThompson was born in San Diego on Dec. 28, 1929. He attended Point Loma High School and was a 1951 graduate of the University of Southern California.\n\nHe met his wife, Jean, at a fraternity/sorority lunch. As the story goes, he saw her playing piano and said to his brother, David, “I’m going to marry that woman someday.” And so they did their senior year.\n\nHe worked a few years at NASSCO to earn some money before enrolling in night school at the Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles.\n\nHe served as a San Diego County deputy district attorney from 1957 until 1960, when he went into private practice at his family law firm.\n\nFourteen years after being appointed federal judge, Thompson served as chief judge until 1991. He assumed senior status in 1994.\n\nThompson, who liked to spend his free time fishing off the San Diego coast, was not much different on the bench than at home.\n\n“He had a perception of fundamental fairness, a perception of justice, and that prevailed in his life. He treated us all the same,” his oldest son said.\n\nAs a young boy, John Thompson would hop on the bus from their Point Loma home to see his dad try cases downtown.\n\n“Up until about the eighth grade, I thought everyone’s dad was either a judge, a defense attorney or a bad guy. That’s all we talked about,” John said.\n\nJohn ultimately followed his dad to the bench.\n\n“For me, this is what Thompsons did.”\n\nThompson’s family tree makes that clear. His father, Gordon Thompson Sr., was presiding judge of the Superior Court for San Diego County. His grandfather, Adam Thompson, was a county judge pro-tem.\n\nHis late brother, David R. Thompson, was a senior judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAnd his middle son, Peter Renwick Thompson, practiced law and is now a mediator and a winery owner in the Napa Valley area. His youngest son, Gordon Thompson III, bucked the law trend and is a former Nike executive and successful shoe designer based in Honolulu.\n\n“I don’t think anybody would ever rival him at instilling confidence in his children that they could accomplish whatever they set out to do,” said son Peter Thompson.\n\nThe judge is also survived by his wife of 64 years, daughter-in-law Candace, four grandchildren – Matthew, Jes, Andrew and Geoffrey – and granddaughter-in-law Laura.\n\nA memorial service is planned for 2 p.m. July 28 at Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church, 2128 Chatsworth Blvd., where he was a longtime member."
