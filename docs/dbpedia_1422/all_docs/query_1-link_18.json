        "text": "Hon. Ronald Abernethy\n\n1899-1995\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Scotland, he emigrated to Toronto, Canada aboard a clipper ship with his family at the age of five. He later became a naturalized United States citizen. During the Depression, Judge Abernethy attended night school at Southwestern University School of Law in Los Angeles. He worked his way through school during the days selling accounting supplies. He passed the Bar examination in 1931 and started his own private practice in Pasadena. In 1942, he became an Assistant United States Attorney in Los Angeles. After commuting to San Diego for several years, he opened the first United States Attorney’s Office on the third floor of San Diego’s downtown federal courthouse on F Street. During World War II, Abernethy advised the F.B.I. on security matters.\n\nIn 1946, he became a Deputy District Attorney in San Diego. During his service as a prosecutor, he worked some of the most difficult and complex cases. His last responsibility was in the Sampsell case – the notorious Seaboard Finance Company Bandit who terrorized San Diego for many months. Recognizing his superb work in the District Attorney’s Office, Governor Earl Warren appointed him to the Bench, where he served with distinction. He first presided over the Municipal Court.\n\nHe joined the Superior Court “in 1960, where he presided over serious murder, kidnaping, bribery, and other felony cases as well as death penalty trials, including Joseph Bernard Morse, the eighteen-year-old who murdered his mother and invalid sister and then a cellmate. ” (LA Times 2/5/60, 12/15/61, 8/7/64, 8/16/64, 10/26/70).\n\nHe finished as Presiding Criminal Judge on the court before retiring in 1969. After retiring, Judge Abernethy returned on a pro tem appointment to impose a sentence on Michael English in 1977. English had fled the jurisdiction after the jury in Abernethy’s courtroom had convicted him of four counts of burglary with intent to rape dorm students at the University of California at Irvine. English’s attorney convinced the court that the defendant had died, but in fact, he had assumed another name. Seven years later, English was extradited from New York, when Judge Abernethy imposed a four year sentence. (LA Times 7/21/77).\n\nRetirement did not conclude Judge Abernethy’s participation and service to the San Diego community. He continued to serve for many years throughout the State as a Judge Pro Tem at the request of the Chief Justice. He exerted a strong influence on the criminal justice system in his many years of service. He died at the age of 96 in May 1995. “He was a dignified, elegant man until his last breath.” (San Diego Union Tribune, May 23, 1995, p. B-5).\n\nTom Adler\n\n1938-2010\n\nTom Adler was born April 24, 1938, in Vienna, Austria. He was two when his family fled the Nazi occupation to the United States. Decades later, as an attorney in San Diego, he devoted himself to championing the underdog, fighting for civil rights and standing up against the abuse of power.\n\nTom received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Arizona State University and moved in the 1960s to San Diego, where he worked as a juvenile probation officer while attending California Western School of Law. He was admitted to the State Bar in 1972. Tom started his legal career at Defenders Program of San Diego, Inc. as a staff attorney, representing indigents accused of crime. Tom later went into private practice representing people accused of crime and later handling civil rights actions in police abuse cases.\n\nTom was a founding member of the San Diego Criminal Defense Bar Association and served as president from 1979 to 1982. He was also a member of the San Diego Criminal Defense Lawyers Club and served as its president in 1990. Tom was a member of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice and served on its board of governors from 1983 to 1990.\n\nFor his work on police misconduct law suits, Tom was named trial lawyer of the year in 1993 by the San Diego Trial Lawyers Association.Tom shared his knowledge and experiences in teaching numerous trial advocacy workshops for criminal defense attorneys, public defenders, and civil rights lawyers. He was an adjunct professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, teaching trial techniques and lawyering skills, for many years.\n\nIn later years Tom worked tirelessly to recover family assets stolen by the Nazis. His investigation culminated in writing the book “Lost to the World”, which was about how he successfully recovered a manuscript of a symphony given as a gift by Gustav Mahler to his grandfather Guido Adler the founder of The Science of Musicology. The proceeds from the sale of the manuscript were donated to charity.Tom was also active in the ACLU for many years and an award named for him goes to a high school newspaper that has shown dedication to the cause of civil liberties.\n\nWhen forced to retire from trial practice because of Parkinson’s Disease, Tom remained active first as a mediator and arbitrator and later as a social activist and philanthropist. Tom died on August 23, 2010 after courageously battling Parkinson’s Disease for 14 years.\n\nLongfellow wrote that \"when a great man dies, for years the light he leaves behind him, lies on the paths of men.\" Tom's sunshine lighted numerous paths and many now lead a better life for it.\n\nHon. Charles Nathaniel Andrews\n\n1859-1937\n\nJudge Charles Andrews was born in Wonewoc, Wisconsin in 1859. He studied law at the University of Wisconsin, taught school in Tennessee, and then practiced law in Mankato, Minnesota and was twice elected as County Attorney there. He moved to California in 1907 to practice law. He practiced until his appointment to the bench in 1912. Judge Andrews was one of the legendary figures on the San Diego judicial bench. Appointed by Governor H. Hiram Johnson, he served for 22 years on the Superior Court Bench until 1934. During a large part of the time on the bench, he served as presiding judge. He passed away in July 1937.\n\nHe was described by Leland G. Stanford “as a jurist of the finest judicial mind and temperament. He was no sheep, no follower of any legal bellwether.” (Footprints of Justice in San Diego, p. 63) He distinguished himself in both civil and criminal cases. “He didn’t use precedents as authority, but as guides for his own thinking. When a legal argument was concluded he leaned back in his judicial chair, frequently with his back to the courtroom, and searched his own thoughts for the right answer. And usually he found it.” (Id.) He sat by appointment on the appellate court and “his decisions were accepted by the bench and the bar as the final correct analysis. The man was a genius in distinguishing propriety from pedantry.” (Id.)\n\nHe stated a man should retire from public life at the age of 75 and make room for a younger person. He resigned at that age after completing 22 years of service on our Superior Court. (Christian Science Monitor, March 4, 1936, p.2). Andrews was noted for his sense of humor, his skill as presiding judge, and for being “a very capable man who seemed to enjoy guiding the younger lawyers, without offending them by his advice.” (Dicta, October 1974).\n\nIn the days before portraits of distinguished judges were displayed in the trial courtrooms of the Superior Court – his portrait stood alone in the busiest trial court in our county. A revered icon in the history of the San Diego bench and bar.\n\nHon. David H. Bartick\n\n1958-2018\n\nMagistrate Judge David H. Bartick was a talented lawyer and compassionate jurist known for his big heart, warm smile, and willingness to help. As then-Chief Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz observed after Judge Bartick’s untimely passing due to melanoma, “Judge Bartick loved his job and we loved him. He was brilliant, kind, fair and had an infectious enthusiasm about every aspect of his job.”\n\nDavid H. Bartick was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Orange County. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a double major in political science and psychology. David represented UC Berkeley in intercollegiate boxing and, after graduation, was invited to compete for a spot on the 1980 Olympic Boxing Team.\n\nDavid graduated from Western State University, now known as Thomas Jefferson School of Law, in 1985 and began his lengthy career as a criminal defense lawyer. While David handled a number of high-profile and complex cases, he also devoted a large portion of his practice to representing indigent clients. David treated all of his clients with respect and zealously represented them to obtain the best possible result regardless of financial status. David was known and admired for his positive personality and his ability to work productively with all participants in the judicial system. In addition to his significant criminal defense caseload, David served as a judge pro tem in the Superior Court for 18 years.\n\nIn 2012, David was chosen to become a Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of California. Judge Bartick was an excellent, thoughtful, and caring jurist. He worked hard and always made time for the people appearing before him, whether a criminal defendant or a civil litigant, to ensure they understood the legal proceedings and felt that they were treated fairly by the system. Judge Bartick’s colleagues remember him as true gentleman who was always willing to listen and help. As Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford stated, “we could not have asked for a more devoted and gracious peer. No matter what the task, David was there to assist, work through complex issues, and cover us whenever and however he could. David treated everyone with respect, dignity, and kindness. He also had a wonderful sense of humor, which was a real asset during challenging times.”\n\nDuring his judicial career, Judge Bartick helped lead the San Diego High School mock trial program, participated in the District Court’s diversion program, which provided an alternative to incarceration for young adults, and devised programs and procedures that assisted prisoners with filing civil cases. After his passing and to honor him, the mock trial program created the Judge David H. Bartick Civility & Sportsmanship Award and the U.S. District Court established the Honorable David H. Bartick Award for Civility and Professionalism.\n\nDavid is survived by his wife, Terry, and theeir two children, Jennifer and Brian.\n\nHon. Howard J. Bechefsky\n\n1940-1980\n\nHoward was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 29, 1940. He graduated from Columbia University in 1962 and Columbia Law School in 1965. He was admitted to the California Bar on January 5, 1966. He served as a Deputy Attorney General for the State of California in Los Angeles from 1966 to 1967. He entered private practice in San Diego and was with Sheela, Lightner, Hughes and Castro from 1968 to 1978. He was a certified criminal law specialist. He participated in many bar activities, chaired the Jail Sub-Committee (1971), the Criminal Law Section (1971), and the Criminal Justice Committee (1972-1973). He was President of Defenders, Inc., Federal Defenders and Appellate Defenders (1972). He was a member of the Board of Directors for the San Diego County Bar Association (1971-1974) and President of the San Diego County Bar in 1972.\n\nHe was appointed to the El Cajon Municipal Court by Governor Jerry Brown on January 12, 1978. He was then appointed to the San Diego Superior Court on February 22, 1979. He was a tireless and dedicated lawyer and judge, constantly working to make the justice system achieve its ideals. He had a sharp mind, a quick wit and a delicate touch. He died on April 19, 1980 after a tragic fall in Strawberry Creek, Idyllwild, California.\n\n“He was all of the nice things one could want in a person. A compassionate, thoughtful, and enthusiastic man. The type of person from who each of us benefitted by knowing.” (Dicta, Sept. 1980, William G. Bailey) “He could be so charming that you had to hold onto your gold fillings for fear that you would give them to him.” (Dicta June 1980, Dennis Adams).\n\nOne year prior to his appointment, the El Cajon Municipal Court had been created as an “experiment” with jurisdiction over some types of Superior Court litigation and only handled cases with the consent of the parties, including sixty percent of the felony cases. Judge Bechefsky felt “[t]he experiment was very exciting and important. It is being carefully watched statewide. I hope to contribute to its success.” (Dicta, Feb. 1978). He admitted that in his transition from a criminal defense attorney to a judge that he would “miss the ‘highs’ that come from winning, but not the ‘lows’ that come from losing. I will particularly miss the close, trusting relationship I had with many of my clients. In addition to helping clients with their cases, I tried to help them with their lives.” Bechefsky identified two reasons for seeking the judicial appointment: “My work as President of the Bar Association increased my interest in public service. The second factor was the close working relationship I developed with Judge [Frank] Orfield. I was very impressed with his enthusiasm and dedication to his work.” (Id.) He stated that his greatest challenge as a judge would be that of “bringing understanding and compassion to people whose background and culture is very different from mine.” (Id.)\n\nPaul Edward Bell\n\n1945-1997\n\nOn July 30, 1997, Paul Edward Bell, the assistant director of Appellate Defenders, Inc., passed away after a long battle with lymphoma. Paul was born on March 29, 1945. He graduated from Seattle University in 1967 with a degree in political science and then graduated from UCLA School of Law. He started his career as an Orange County Public Defender, then worked as a research attorney with the San Bernardino Court of Appeal. In 1974, Paul became a staff member of Appellate Defenders, Inc. (which had been founded in 1972 to handle appeals in San Diego). He was named assistant director in 1979 and remained in that position until his death. Paul was instrumental in getting the current appellate project system off the ground in 1983 and in expanding ADI’s responsibilities to the entire Fourth Appellate District.\n\nIn 1995, Paul served as the chair of the San Diego County Bar Association’s Appellate Court Committee. He was also honored with the Warhorse Award of the San Diego Criminal Defense Bar Association.\n\nPaul argued many Court of Appeal cases. He appeared before the California Supreme Court on six occasions, posting an impressive five victories. Paul’s work at Appellate Defenders changed the face of criminal appellate law by affecting changes in delinquency, juvenile dependency, welfare law, no-issue cases, and sentencing.\n\nThe board of directors of Appellate Defenders, Inc., has honored Paul. The Paul Bell Award is presented annually at the Defender Dinner to an attorney who has demonstrated excellence in the representation of the indigent accused on appeal. The Paul Bell Memorial Fellowship is awarded annually to newer attorneys in recognition of Paul’s dedication to indigent appellate defense, and his well known interest in the development of promising appellate attorneys.\n\nThe law was not an intellectual abstraction to Paul, nor simply a means of making a living. As he told his wife Dianne early in their relationship, “I don’t care if I don’t make a lot of money. I want to help people.” He cared about helping the little guy, and it showed in the way he dealt with every case and every client; as if they were the most special one of his career. Paul should be remembered for his prodigious knowledge of the law, for his dedication to his family, clients, and community, and for his wonderful smile.\n\nGerald “Jerry” Blank\n\n1946-2019\n\nGerald \"Jerry\" Blank was born in 1946 in Chester, Pennsylvania. His family moved to Palm Springs, California, in 1960. Jerry attended California State University, Northridge and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science in 1968. He then attended law school at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, where he was active in the legal clinic program, and graduated with his Juris Doctor in 1971.\n\nJerry started his legal career working for the Western Center on Law and Poverty in Los Angeles, and then opened his own law office where he practiced criminal defense. He was one of the attorneys involved in Murgia v. Municipal Court, 15 C3d 286 (1975), which dealt with selective prosecution. He also represented Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam veteran who became active in protests opposing the Vietnam War. When Jerry's office burned down, he began traveling in Latin America where he became fluent in Spanish. When he returned to the United States, he was hired in 1979 as a staff attorney with Defenders Program of San Diego, Inc.\n\nIn July of 1980, Jerry became part of Landon, Blank, Bowden, and Russell, handling an indigent defense felony contract with the County of San Diego. In 1982, he opened his own office practicing primarily criminal defense. Another one of Jerry's notable cases was People v. Genzler, a homicide case where he was initially removed as the attorney based on the prosecutor's representation that Jerry would be a prosecution witness. The murder conviction was ultimately reversed based on the fact that Jerry was never called as a witness. On retrial, Jerry won Mr. Genzler's freedom based on only an involuntary manslaughter conviction.\n\nJerry was involved with many boards and organizations serving the legal community. He was a Lifetime Member of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a Sustaining Member of the San Diego Criminal Defense Bar Association, a Board Member and past president of the Board of the Defenders Organizations of San Diego, Member of the Board of the Institute For Criminal Defense Advocacy, Founder and past president of the San Diego County Indigent Criminal Defense Grant Fund, and a Member of the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nJerry's service to the profession and community was recognized by being given a number of awards. He received the following awards: the Trial Attorney of the Year and Warhorse awards from the San Diego Criminal Defense Bar Association; the E. Stanley Conant Award from the Defenders Organization of San Diego; and the Reginald Heber Smith Award from the National Legal Aid and Defenders Organization.\n\nIn 2019, Jerry was diagnosed with progressive supra nuclear palsy and, ultimately, decided to end his life under the California Death with Dignity Law on December 14, 2019. During his more than 45 years of practicing law, Jerry gave so much of his energy and commitment to his clients, his colleagues, his community, and to the criminal justice community. Jerry's memory lives on and inspires those seeking justice.\n\nHon. Madge Bradley\n\n1904-2000\n\nBorn in Ukiah, California on November 14, 1904, Madge Bradley was the second of five children born to Hugh and Bertha Bradley. Her father emigrated from England and met her mother at an English settlement in Oceanside, California. After a brief time grape farming in Northern California, the family returned to Oceanside when Madge was 6. She graduated from Oceanside-Carlsbad Union High School in 1922, and began working for Union Title Insurance and Trust Company in San Diego.\n\nWith the encouragement of a former salesman from LaSalle Extension University in Chicago, Madge began taking correspondence courses. She would awake early to study law before going to work, debating the material with her mother whom she referred to as her “only classmate.” In 1927 she was hired by the San Diego County clerk’s office and became the clerk in charge of passports and naturalization records. She passed the California bar exam in 1933 and was admitted to practice on June 9, 1933.\n\nBecause of financial pressures during the Great Depression, Madge did not begin to practice law until 1940, when she took a year leave of absence to work with a firm helping clients prove their citizenship, and landlords evict undesirable tenants. In 1942, Madge Bradley opened her own practice, specializing in adoptions, domestic relations, probate and guardianship work. She chaired the first Community Welfare Council’s Adoption Study Committee. This committee was instrumental in changing California adoption laws and making San Diego the first in the state to receive a license to operate an adoption agency.\n\nMadge Bradley blazed a number of trails, including being the first woman on the Board of Directors of the San Diego County Bar Association, the first San Diego County woman to be appointed to a State Bar Committee, the first woman in San Diego to serve as a judge, and the first woman to preside over San Diego’s Municipal Court.\n\nJudge Bradley took her oath of office on November 16, 1953. Being the first woman on the bench was not easy. Often litigants would ask for reassignment to another judge, and another judge purposefully held judicial meetings at the Grant Grill where women were not allowed. The newspaper focused on her attire and hobbies. Over time, Judge Bradley earned a reputation of being firm, fair and well-liked. She was re-elected three times in uncontested elections before retiring on December 1, 1971. It would take fourteen months after she retired before the second woman was appointed to the San Diego bench.\n\nJudge Bradley continued with her community activities, becoming the first chair of the Woman’s Division of the San Diego Traffic Safety Council. She was named San Diego “Woman of the Year” in 1953. In 1995, the Madge Bradley Building was named for this trail blazing woman lawyer, and is today where domestic violence and probate cases are heard.\n\nWilliam Braniff\n\n1941-2015\n\nBill Braniff was born in New York on July 8, 1941. He was raised in New Jersey. In 1960 he was in an automobile accident that resulted him him being a paraplegic. He continued with his education, and graduated from Seton Hall University in 1966, and then from Rutgers University Law School in 1969. He was sworn in as an assistant US Attorney (AUSA) for the Newark office in 1970 and became the chief of the criminal division of the Newark office.\n\nIn 1980, he transferred to the San Diego office of the US Attorney. During his time as an AUSA in those two offices, Bill developed expertise in prosecuting many crimes, including military procurement fraud, healthcare fraud, environmental crimes, and major narcotics trafficking. He was very good at analyzing and prosecuting complex criminal cases.\n\nIn 1988 he was sworn in as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, a position that he held until1993. During Bill's tenure in that position, that office grew to 90 attorneys, and became one of the leading prosecutorial offices in the nation. He was dedicated to leading that office in the effective and ethical prosecution of federal offenses. He taught Assistant US Attorneys to take great care in writing the statement of facts in an appellate brief. He told them \"if you do a good job on the statement of facts, it will be obvious what the right outcome should be\".\n\nBill had a lot of trial experience. One day some younger trial lawyers in his office were speculating about which way the jury was going to go. Bill shook his head. \"Hey\", he grinned at them. \"The bowling ball is headed down the lane, and all the body language in the world ain't going to change it's course\"\n\nAfter leaving the US Attorney's office, Bill practiced with Latham and Watkins, and then had his own private practice. He was on the Criminal Justice Act panel in San Diego. His practice included defense of white collar criminal cases, as well as defense of indigent defendants accused of federal offenses. He brought the same high standards to the defense of criminal charges as he brought to the prosecution of criminal cases.\n\nBill passed away on November 7, 2015.\n\nHon. John Jerome “Jack” Brennan, Sr.\n\n1883-1973\n\nJudge Brennan was born in 1883 near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He completed his education at Fordham University. After moving to San Diego, he practiced with L.L. Boone as one of San Diego’s leading attorneys.\n\nIn 1912, he met his future wife in New York. Arcadia Bandini Scott was from an old and prominent family long identified with the development of Southern California, including San Diego. They married in Los Angeles that October. Mrs. Brennan’s father was also a lawyer and served as County Clerk at the offices in Old Town.\n\nIn the 1920s, Brennan was a prominent attorney. “As a business man, his reputation is of sterling worth, as a lawyer of marked ability, and personally his friends are legion because of his sincere kindness and genial nature.” (Clarence Alan McGrew, City of San Diego and San Diego County: The Birthplace of California at 140-41 (1922)).\n\nJudge Brennan was appointed to the Municipal Court Bench by Governor Olsen on October 7, 1941 where he served until his retirement in 1961. Brennan was initially assigned to the Traffic Court, two months before Pearl Harbor, which in “the immediate beginning of the war years, and San Diego’s mushrooming, boom-town, service-swamped streets, the job became one of the most difficult in the United States. Brennan met the problems patiently, scientifically and effectively. At times the workload was so heavy that the judge worked both night and day. He seldom took a vacation.” (Leland G. Stanford, Footprints of Justice in San Diego at 99). Brennan’s impact was felt through the 1960s. “In no inconspicuous way these ultra-great of San Diego’s exotic formative years march today under the name of Brennan – and toward new history-making heights in this adopted city of the young New York lawyers who became one of our community’s socially-distinguished, professionally acute, and hardest working municipal court judges.” (Id.)\n\nHon. Michael William Brennan\n\n1942-1985\n\nBorn June 14, 1942 in Indianapolis, Brennan received his undergraduate degree from Wabash College, a small liberal arts college for men in Indiana, and his law degree from Western State University College of Law in Fullerton, California. Prior to law school he was a social worker and he worked as a juvenile probation officer during law school. His travels took him to Ireland, where he attended Trinity College in Dublin and worked as a gardener; to France, where he worked as a hotel manager; to Japan, where he taught English; and to Guatemala, where he enjoyed time as an amateur archaeologist. He was admitted to the California Bar in 1973.\n\nJudge Donald Smith remembered Brennan as a young lawyer: “He tried cases with amazing success in my courtroom where many of his arguments bordered on impropriety. But he would make them with such grace and style that even his opponents would be touched by his charm.” “He always tried to act as a mediator among other judges. His blarney helped him through many a trying moment.” He loved to travel and to teach. “He was proud to be a judge. In the years prior to his death, his reputation was growing as a man who had that special zest for living – he had that special appreciation of every sunrise or sunset.” During his last year, while battling cancer, he continued to come to work, “day after day, when the pain and suffering must have been overwhelming, [yet] he never wallowed in self-pity.” (Dicta, November 1985).\n\nHe worked as a staff attorney at the Defenders Program from the time of his admission to the Bar in 1973, and upon taking the bench, he was appointed as the supervisor of the El Cajon Defenders Office. (Dicta May 1979). He recounted an amusing story during an arraignment of a defendant who had stolen a lamp from the Defenders Office. The defendant sought the replacement of his appointed attorney claiming that the office “hated him so much that they were unable to effectively represent him.” Judge Brennan re-assigned the case and did not remind the defendant that he had been the attorney in the Defenders Office who had retrieved the stolen lamp. (Id.)\n\nLes Dubow, a Deputy District Attorney who appeared in Judge Brennan’s Municipal Courtroom in El Cajon and was a personal friend, stated that Brennan was “extremely proud of the legal system and his place in it. He was always eager to work. Much to the chagrin of his clerk and bailiff, Michael would walk the halls looking for more cases to handle. He truly loved being a judge. He enjoyed speaking to various civic organizations about the court and the profession. In short, Michael enjoyed us as much as we enjoyed him.” “Michael enjoyed sailing and traveling. He loved to talk about his adventures on the Orient Express, his school days in Ireland, and his quasi archeological expeditions to Rome, Egypt, and Mexico. He was a man on the go, enchanted with life and eager to unlock the mysteries of the past.” He was “the eternal optimist. He was genuinely interested in people and was always on hand to lend aid and comfort to those in need.” (Id.)\n\n“On the bench Michael projected three characteristics: fairness, compassion, and strength of conviction. To quote a well respected member of the defense bar, ‘If you’ve got it coming – stay away from Judge Brennan.’ He quickly earned a reputation for sending more El Cajon defendants to prison than all other Judges, yet time and again defense attorney ‘Arbuckled’ their way to Brennan for that break they so desperately needed for their client.” In one petty theft case, Brennan personally followed the defendant’s progress with weekly, in person, progress reports. (From letters to Dicta).\n\nFriends reported that after leaving a doctor’s office who had opined that he had only two months to live, Brennan spoke at a luncheon of the Foothills Bar Association on the future of the El Cajon Superior Court, and told a colleague that “I want to die on the bench, with style and serve those I love.” “He functioned as a Judge, husband, father and friend when he was in such pain and physical agony he had to be helped in and out of cars, on and off the bench. Despite all this, his mental ability, his wit, sense of humor, and ability to function as an outstanding Municipal Court Judge continued until he was taken from us on September 30, 1985.” (Id.)\n\nWilliam Alden Brockett, Jr.\n\n1941-1996\n\nBill Brockett was born on January 21, 1941. He was a United States Naval Academy graduate and served as a commissioned officer in the Navy. He graduated from Yale Law School and immediately became immersed in criminal law. He worked as a staff attorney with Federal Defenders in San Diego and then with State Defenders, trying numerous criminal cases for the indigent.\n\nAfter four years as a public defender in San Diego and San Francisco, Brockett took time off to play professional poker and bicycle through Europe. (SF Recorder, 6/18/96). He had diverse interests and was said to be “as happy shooting pool as he was reading poetry.” (Brockett’s brother-in-law and a civil rights lawyer Thomas Meyer) (SF Recorder, 6/18/96). Brockett co-wrote the well-respected CLE book Effective Direct and Cross Examination in 1986 with John Keker.\n\nHe had a reputation as a lawyer who was intellectually astute and persuasive before judges and juries. U.S. District Court Judge Claudia Wilken, who had known Bill for more than 20 years, regarded him as good on the law and charming in front of a jury.\n\nBill moved to San Francisco and broadened his practice to include civil litigation. He and John Keker formed the highly respected firm of Keker & Brockett. Both went on to achieve formidable reputations as brilliant and tenacious advocates for their clients. Brockett liked to say that “In the process of building Keker and Brockett, we went from representing bank robbers to bank presidents.” (SF Recorder, 6/18/96).\n\nBill later became a partner in the Legal Strategies Group of Emeryville. He was a vigorous and committed proponent of nuclear non-proliferation and worked as a volunteer in that cause. He was widely known for his humanity and wit. He died at the untimely age of 55 in Berkeley on June 15, 1996 from a brain tumor.\n\nUpon his passing, members of the Bar commented that “Bill Brockett was a great gentlemen to try a case with and a great gentlemen to try a case against.” (James Brosnahan); “He showed that civility and grace in the practice of law was not and should not be a bygone of the legal community.” (Louise Ma). (SF Recorder, 6/18/96). The Bill Brockett Public Interest Fellowship was established in his honor to fund community outreach projects by recent law school graduates. He left us with many thoughts, including these:\n\nIs there a way to practice law with dignity? I need to care less about winning the trivial battles, more about decency.\n\nNever be gnawed by the rats of remorse.\n\nI believe in living life to the fullest, or ten o’clock, whichever comes first.\n\nCharles \"Ted\" Bumer\n\n1923-1996\n\nCharles \"Ted\" Bumer was born December 13, 1923. He left Kenyon College during World War II to join the Navy, where he served with the underwater demolition team. He earned his B.S. from Cornell and received his J.D. from George Washington University in 1949. He then re-enlisted in the Navy, received training in Coronado and served during the Korean War with the underwater demolition team.\n\nHe began to practice law as a sole practitioner in San Diego in 1953. During the Vietnam War, Ted represented political activists who were arrested for protesting the war and conditions in the country. His clients included activists from student groups, Black Panthers, Brown Berets, and women's groups. Ted also represented many individuals in the military who faced court martials and administrative proceedings. In 1982, he represented the first person charged in Federal Court with violating the new registration law, Benjamin Sasway, who refused to register with the Selective Service System. “In our history, we have made heroes of people who have looked the Government in the face and said no.” (quoting Bumer on his client’s stand behind his moral beliefs against the draft)\n\nIn 1991, Ted represented Dean Carter in a capital case. Carter was tried for rape and murder of as many as five women. That same year, Bumer represented Navy Officer Robert Nydegger in a retrial of first-degree murder charges following a deadlocked first trial.\n\nIn her tribute, Mary E. Harvey wrote that Bumer “was a skillful and thoughtful (inventive) lawyer, and always, unfailingly, a gentleman. His no fee cases, in those days [the 1960s], probably outnumbered his fee cases. These cases ranged from questioning probable cause stops of van drivers with long hair, to complex cases of refusal to register for the draft, etc.” She continued, he “acted on his profound belief in the constitutional rights of individuals. He was witty, broadly read, fun and mentored countless young lawyers.”\n\nOf his Black Panther clients, “60 Minutes” Producer and former editor of the underground San Diego Street Journal in the 1960s, Lowell Bergman stated that “Ted risked destroying his practice by representing rebels. But he never sought the limelight.” “For years, Ted was one of the only attorneys in San Diego who would defend those doing unpopular things. He was involved in a lot of high profile cases without taking a high-profile role.” (SDUT Oct. 1, 1996). He was a tenacious advocate for civil rights, and he wasn’t in it for the money. (Id., citing Judge Frederic Link). Between 1969 and 1973, there was rarely a day when he didn’t appear in a courtroom in San Diego County (making 450 appearances in 250 court days).\n\nThe National Lawyers Guild, of which Bumer was a proud member, recognized his life-long fight to protect constitutional rights liberties by creating the Charles T. Bumer Civil Libertarian Award to the Thomas Jefferson Law School student who best personifies the ideals to which he devoted his life.\n\nTed was a member of the San Diego Criminal Defense Lawyer's Club and California Attorney's for Criminal Justice. He died in a car accident on September 11, 1996 at age 72. His obituary stated, quite accurately, he put his life on the line to defend the unpopular.\n\nHon Edward T. Butler\n\n1918-2003\n\nEd Butler was born in Michigan in 1918. He worked his way through college, doing odd jobs and serving in the Merchant Marine. In 1941, he graduated from George Washington University. He joined the Marines as a lieutenant, and served in the Pacific during World War II. He received the Bronze Star for his actions during combat at Guadalcanal. The day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima he applied to (and was accepted by) Harvard Law School.\n\nIn 1948, he received his law degree from Harvard, and was admitted to the California Bar in 1949. His practice of law was interrupted for two more years of service as a marine officer during the Korean War. He came to San Diego in 1959 to work as general counsel and manager of Electro Instruments, an electric volt meter company.\n\nEd served as City Attorney of San Diego from 1964 through 1969 before running an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of San Diego in 1971. From 1969 through 1975, he was a partner in the firm of Schall, Butler, Boudreau and Gore. Long an active Democrat, he was rewarded in 1975 with a Superior Court judgeship after co-chairing Edmund G. \"Jerry\" Brown, Jr.'s successful 1974 campaign for governor of California. The San Diego Trial Lawyers Association named him Judge of the Year in 1980 “for his strong and incisive decision-making ability, coupled with humor and compassion.” (Dicta July 1980).\n\n“Butler is widely known for his eloquence, razor sharp wit and occasional equally sharp tongue.” In a profile in 1984, Butler stated that “The law is the last refuge of the free man and woman.” (Dicta Jan. 1984). Judge Butler carried on the tradition started by Judge Dean Sherry of wearing a green robe every St. Patrick’s Day – a tradition continued to this day by Judge Thomas J. Whelan, first in Superior Court and then in the District Court. (100 Years of Justice, Chronicle of the San Diego County Bar Assn, at 99).\n\nGovernor Brown elevated Butler to the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Division One in 1982. He served there with distinction, writing scholarly, and often pithy, civil and criminal opinions until he reached the age of 70 in February 1988. Butler, who was a self-described \"Edmund Burke liberal\" -- conservative on property issues and liberal on individual rights -- remained active in the legal community after his retirement. He worked as legal counsel with a local law firm as well as with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. as a \"rent-a­judge.\" In 2000, the San Diego City Council proclaimed February 27 “Ed Butler day.”\n\nButler died in 2003 at the age of 85. Friends and family remember him as an Irish jurist, humorist, and poet who was open-minded, compassionate, and elevated appellate opinion writing to an art form, often quoting from Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare. His reputation for fairness, especially in criminal matters, earned him wide respect in the legal community. He left this world on December 23, 2003.\n\nHon. James Marshall Carter\n\n1904-1979\n\nJames Carter was born March 11, 1904, in Santa Barbara, California. He graduated from Pomona College in 1924. Carter played tackle for Pomona against U.S.C. in the first football game held at the Los Angeles Coliseum in October 1923. He attended his first year at Harvard Law, but returned to his native California when he ran out of money. He completed his legal studies at U.S.C., where he was awarded the Order of Coif. U.S.C. was then located at First and Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. Carter went to law school while simultaneously working as a physical education teacher.\n\nAs a lawyer, Carter handled controversial causes in the 1930s. For example, he represented the ACLU, sued the Chief of Police for sending squads of officers to arrest immigrants who did not have enough money, and was active in forming labor unions and negotiating contracts with cost of living increases. “He was a tireless fighter for the rights of the poor and the oppressed.” He served as the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles, 1940-1942. The DMV was then in charge of the California Highway Patrol and as Director Carter pioneered fair employment practices and hired the first black highway patrolman.\n\nAfter his service with the DMV, he returned to private practice in Los Angeles before becoming the Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California, 1943-1946, and then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, 1946-1949. He was an extremely competent prosecutor and an able administrator of that office during the troubled times of World War II. While the United States Attorney, Carter successfully prosecuted Tomoya Kawakita, a dual citizen of Japan and the United States, for treason after a ten-week trial in 1948. The case grabbed the nation’s attention as the one of the pair of treason indictments filed after World War II (the other, Iva Toguri D’Aquino, was identified as “Toyko Rose”). Kawakita was employed as an interpreter at a Japanese military prison, and dozens of soldiers testified to the brutal punishments and sadistic torments he inflicted on the weakened men working at the mining camp. There have been only thirty prosecutions for treason, and Kawakita’s conviction remains the last to this day. (LA Times 12/21/01; Kawakita v. United States, 96 F. Supp. 824 (S.D. Cal. 1950), aff’d, 343 U.S. 717 (1952)).\n\nCarter administered the power of his office consistent with Chief Justice Stone’s standard – the United States Attorney should always remember that he was the representative of a sovereignty whose right to govern depended upon its governing justly; that while he could strike hard blows, he should never strike foul ones.\n\nOn September 23, 1949, he was nominated by President Harry S. Truman to a new federal judgeship, and received his commission on October 18, 1949. He served as the chief judge from 1966-1967. Carter was instrumental in separating the Southern District of California from the shadow of Los Angeles. From 1929 to 1949, federal judges from Los Angeles presided by assignment in the “Southern Division of the Southern District.” In 1949, Judge Jacob Weinberger was assigned as the first “resident” federal judge in San Diego. Despite the tremendous growth in the region after World War II, and the concomitant increase in the case load, for nine years prior to 1965, the Judicial Conference of the United States opposed the creation of new Districts. Judge Carter is credited with convincing the Judicial Conference to change its position, and despite opposition by some public officials, Congress created the Southern District of California in 1966. Carter, who had moved to San Diego some years earlier, was named the first Chief Judge of the new District until his Circuit appointment the next year.\n\nIn addition to the key role he played in the formation of the Southern District, Carter was a leader in the creation of the Federal Defender Project (funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation following the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964). He selected and appointed the superb lawyers who staffed that unique Project, including Harry Steward, Warren P. Reese, and John Hart Ely, to insure that competent attorneys represented indigents accused of federal crimes. Omnibus criminal pretrial motion procedure and automatic bail review were two of the many the outstanding innovations that Carter brought to the District.\n\nAs a District Judge, he sincerely respected the dignity of each individual appearing before him. It was his singular practice to call each defendant into his chambers to explain exactly why he had imposed the specific sentence and what he intended the defendant to do to satisfy the sentence. Another custom, was that Judge Carter would hand each defendant placed on probation an old key to symbolize that he now controlled the “key to the jail” if they wanted to return. Some defendants later returned the key to Judge Carter with thanks. In schoolbook-Spanish, Judge Carter would tell those immigrants charged with illegal entry that he had visited Mexico, had known many of that country’s citizens, and found them to be honorable people. If the defendant raised his hand and promised never to return, Judge Carter would sentence him to probation so that he could be promptly deported.\n\nAfter eighteen years of distinguished service as a trial judge, Carter was elevated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1967 by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nThroughout his thirty-year judicial career, Carter served with dedication on many national committees concerned with criminal law issues, such as the Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act; the American Bar Association’s Subcommittee on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice; Congress’s Commission to Revise Criminal Laws; and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.\n\nCarter’s impact on the region extended to education. He was instrumental is the founding of the Law School at the University of San Diego, where he taught for many years. In 1962, the school awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws.\n\nAt the many memorials upon Carter’s death, colleagues uniformly complimented his personal characteristics -- which included “a sense of humility that was real and mistakable,” “the most sensible of men; learned, pragmatic, and absolutely without pretense”; natural warmth and compassion; and a commitment to excel -- as well as his professional attributes. “He had all the attributes of a great Judge. He was patient, courteous and respectful of others. He was attentive and he was always prepared.” All agreed that he coupled a keen intellect and analytical mind with a true love of the law, which made this hardworking judge one of the most creative and effective in the nation. Carter was respected for his courageous and decisive rulings which were never arbitrary due to his common sense, integrity, and impartiality. John Sutro, a former appellate law clerk, summed up: “In his day-to-day life, both on and off the bench, he devoted himself to making a reality the high principles to which he adhered. And by doing so, he enriched all our lives.”\n\nJudge Carter served on the Circuit until November 18, 1979, when he passed away. The San Diego Union editorial, “The Law is Loser,” stated: “Circuit Judge James M. Carter, whose sudden, unexpected death Sunday stunned the community and the legal profession, successfully defied the bleak observation that life ends for most persons as a battered shipwreck. He departed under full sail, with colors flying.”\n\nRamon Castro\n\n1926-2017\n\nRamon Castro was born on November 11, 1926 in the small mountain town of Monolith, CA. There, Ramon and his siblings attended a two-room Aqueduct Grammar School. After high school, Ramon served in the Merchant Marines for two years and then attended Santa Clara University for one year on a basketball scholarship. He transferred to Berkeley and received a B.A. degree in 1953. Afterwards, Ramon enlisted in the U.S. Army where he served as an infantry officer, weapons instructor and company commander. After his military service, Ramon attended the University of San Francisco Law School and received his law degree in 1961.\n\nUpon graduating, Ramon moved to San Diego and went to work as a prosecutor in the San Diego City Attorney’s office for 2 years.? In 1963, he went into private practice, and in 1965, he took on the high-profile defense of Terry Pat Thompson, a Marine charged with the murder-by-torture death of his 17-month-old stepdaughter.? After a 3-week trial that was the subject of extensive media coverage, the jury found Thompson not guilty.?\n\nThe Thompson case served as a catalyst for Ramon’s success as a trial lawyer. In 1966, Ramon joined the law firm of Sheela, O’Laughlin, and Hughes, a firm that included future Criminal Justice Memorial honorees Barton C. Sheela, Jr., John F. O’Laughlin, and Peter J. Hughes. The firm went on to include other luminaries, including former U.S. Attorney Michael H. Walsh and San Diego Superior Court Judge Federico Castro, Ramon’s brother. At the firm, Ramon handled and successfully tried many high-profile cases in San Diego in both the State and Federal Courts and went several years without a loss in the San Diego Superior Courts.\n\nHaving earned a reputation as an exceptional trial lawyer, Ramon was admitted into the Trial Lawyers Hall of Fame. His talents as an attorney were further recognized when Ramon was offered state and federal judgeships during the Jerry Brown and Jimmy Carter administrations, Ramon turned down the judgeships because he loved his role as a defense trial lawyer more than anything. In fact, Ramon told his friends that he knew at the age of 10 that he was going to be a criminal defense attorney because he was so drawn to standing up for the accused in a gladiatorial contest.?\n\nEven though he decided against becoming a judge, Ramon made important contributions to the judiciary by accepting a role in the judicial selection process.? During the Governor Jerry Brown years, he helped Gov. Brown place a large number of minorities and women on the California state bench. He also served as a member of the U.S. Judge Nominating Commission in 1979; Federal Magistrate Merit Selection Panel for the Southern District of California, 1994-95; and the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference Senior Advisory Board, 1994-97.\n\nHe also mentored and supported young lawyers like former U.S. Attorney Gregory A. Vega who was the first Latino United States Attorney in the history of the Southern District of California. Mr. Vega said of Ramon ““Ramon Castro was such a positive role model for me and many other Latino lawyers.? Not only was he an outstanding trial attorney, but he set the bar for ethical behavior and how one should conduct oneself in and out of the courtroom. He was the consummate lawyer who will be missed, but never forgotten.”\n\nOver the course of his career, Ramon was active in many professional organizations including:\n\nThe San Diego County Bar Association (Board and Officer); American Trial Lawyers Association; San Diego Trial Lawyers Association; National Association of Defense Counsel in Criminal Cases; and California Trial Lawyers Association. La Raza Lawyers of San Diego\n\nRamon was respected as an iconic and brilliant lawyer and esteemed for his selflessness and kindness to those that followed him. He is survived by his beloved wife, Marian, who was married to Ramon for 50 years, and with whom he shared a deep and spiritual relationship.\n\nGeorge Woodman Clarke\n\n1951-2012\n\nGeorge “Woody” Clarke was born in San Diego on May 10, 1951. He grew up in the suburbs east of San Diego and was graduated from Grossmont High School in La Mesa. He received a bachelor's degree from UC San Diego in 1977. He initially worked in the courts as a research attorney and then decided to join the DA's Office in 1982. He stayed there for 22 years.\n\nWoody, as he was known, was co-prosecutor in the trial involving the murder of Danielle Van Dam. The defendant was convicted and sent to death row. Woody also helped prosecute David Allen Lucas who was convicted of killing three people. He handled many other serious cases in San Diego. He was a pioneer in the forensic use of DNA and was called upon nationally by other prosecutors to assist in cases. In the mid-1990s, he was asked to help in Los Angeles in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson. In addition to many other awards, he was named the 2003 Outstanding Prosecutor of the Year by the California District Attorneys Association and 2003 Prosecutor of the Year by the San Diego District Attorneys Association.\n\n\"He championed the use of DNA science in the criminal justice system for a number of years,\" said Superior Court Judge Christopher Plourd, a former defense attorney. \"He was a major force behind getting it accepted and used-both for protecting people who were innocent, and convicting people who were guilty.\"\n\nIn 2008 he compiled his career of courtroom experiences into the book, \"Justice and Science: Trials and Triumphs of DNA Evidence.\" He was appointed to the U.S. Department of Justice Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence. In 2002, he was named to the U.S. Attorney General Initiative on DNA Laboratory Backlogs. He was also instrumental in helping propose several legislative improvements to California criminal law. In the San Diego DA's Office, he helped establish an in-house \"innocence project\" that offered DNA testing to convicted defendants in certain cases.\n\nIn 2003, George Clarke was appointed San Diego Superior Court judge. He served on the bench until his death on November 13, 2012. Robert Trentacosta, presiding judge of the San Diego Superior Court, stated, \"Our court was so truly blessed to have him as a colleague. He was talented and yet so humble. He was the quintessential gentleman.\"\n\nWoody Clarke was a man of compassion, faith, humor, and intellect. He was highly regarded by all.\n\nJohn J. Cleary\n\n1936-2020\n\nHis energy and unbridled enthusiasm for life gave him monikers of “Machine Gun Cleary” and “The White Phosphorus Kid.” He was a wonderful eccentric who lived a Spartan life and was known for his trademark Army boots that he wore both with casual clothes and in court. He was as inspiring as he was accomplished–an Army Captain and Ranger, academic, motorcyclist, outstanding defender and leader, learned in the law and languages.\n\nJohn is best known in the legal community as the longtime Federal Defender in San Diego (1971-1983), President of the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice (1981-1982), President of the California Public Defenders Association (1979-1980), as the first public defender to serve on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys (1979-1985), or as President of the San Diego Criminal Defense Lawyers group (1980). He was a law partner (Cleary & Sevilla, 1984 to 2004), a teacher, presenter of electrifying lectures, and author of defense articles and amicus briefs. The San Diego Defender organizations named an annual award, the Conant-Cleary Award, for his exceptional and unselfish devotion to protecting the rights of the indigent accused.\n\nJohn’s generous nature made him way ahead of his time in giving second chances to people who had made terrible mistakes landing them in jail. While running Federal Defenders, he championed hiring people coming out of prison who had demonstrated character and skills as “jailhouse” lawyers. One of them was Benjamin Franklin Rayborn. In a unique legal action, Ben got an early release from prison on bail from Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. The condition of bail was Ben’s release to the custody John J. Cleary. See John’s article: “Return to the Rock: An Interview with Benjamin Franklin Rayborn,” 5 CACJ Forum (Nov/Dec 1978) pp. 15-20. See also https://fdsdi.com/in-memoriam/.\n\nJohn made San Diego Federal Defenders a model for the nation and its excellent performance continues to this day. He was a great boss who respected his lawyers and staff, and always had their back. John was a generous friend and mentor to countless numbers in and out of the office. John’s influence on the attorneys and staff he hired at Federal Defenders is incalculable. Most went on to excel in their careers in the law. His generosity, whether with his time, advice, or finances knew no limits.\n\nWhile running the office, John took a caseload like the rest of the attorneys often volunteering for the most difficult cases. This was leadership by example. He had many Ninth Circuit oral arguments and argued a half dozen cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. One of them, a most important Fourth Amendment case, forbade random law enforcement stops of vehicles via racial profiling. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975).\n\nJohn had an unquenchable thirst for challenges, the more difficult the better. After spending summers studying Russian at Middlebury, Vt., he moved to Russia to earn his Ph.D in 1998, writing his in Russian on “The Russian Jury Trial: The Symbol of Troubled Judicial Reform.” Thereafter, in 2004-2005, he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to work in Russia as a professor at Moscow State University (MGU) and the Russian Academy of Justice where he taught Russian law students law courses in Russian.\n\nHe became an unofficial goodwill Ambassador between Russia and the U.S. by initiating law student exchanges each year. For the American students, he taught an annual intensive summer course at MGU on Russian Criminal Justice for San Diego State University. From July 2004, he began an annual summer course on the American Legal System (in English) for Russian students at San Diego State University. He did this out of his pocket simply for the joy of creating communication and understanding between our peoples. Three Russian students who participated in the exchanges went on to receive master of law degrees and a number went on to became licensed attorneys in the U.S.\n\nAs a new challenge, John decided to learn Mandarin Chinese and spent three years living in China studying at Xiamen University. Thereafter, he ran exchanges between the U.S. and China on the same model he created for the Russian students. Chinese students were amazed at how this 80 year-old could master Mandarin and run the exchange programs. They made a wonderful documentary film on his work in facilitating the exchange programs titled, “Ming Datong and his Summer Program” found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEhJgKj-vmM.\n\nHow did this extraordinary man’s journey begin? John was the proud son of an Irish Chicago cop and grew up in the rough and tumble of the Chicago streets. He got his undergraduate and legal education at Loyola University in Chicago. Afterward, from 1960-1964, in the U.S. Army, he became a Ranger, served as a Judge Advocate Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (as prosecutor and defense counsel), and at the JFK Special Warfare Center. He was very proud to be the first Judge Advocate with the Green Berets. His hundreds of parachute jumps earned him a HALO certificate for jumping in “free fall” fourteen times at high altitude with low opening.\n\nAfter the service, from 1964 to 1969, John worked as the Deputy Director, National Defender Project (a Ford Foundation grant program) to organize and improve defender offices in the U.S. by the creation of model defender offices. It was through this work that he helped federal defender programs become models for the spread of defender offices throughout the nation. Ironically, this funding included the office in San Diego, which he would soon come to lead from 1971 to 1983.\n\nJohn Cleary lived life to the fullest. Despite his many achievements, he was a modest man, never a self-promoter. He rejoiced each day when he got up “sucking air.” Up to his final days, he followed a two hour exercise regimen that would intimidate men half his age. He engaged life with humor, read voraciously, traveled the world extensively, had the gift of gab with interesting opinions on everything, and possessed a lust for life to his last day. Whether in life, law, or languages, John’s legacy of inspiration has spread over the years. He lives on in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.\n\nE. Stanley Conant\n\n1915-1980\n\nStanley Conant was a native of San Diego and a graduate of UCLA and then Loyola Law School. He served for three years as a Deputy District Attorney in San Diego and then entered private practice, where his practice focused exclusively in the defense of criminal cases.\n\nHe was a dedicated and skilled defense attorney. He represented many serious cases, including homicides in which the death penalty was sought. For example, Conant, who was appointed for purposes of the direct appeal to the California Supreme Court, successfully reduced a death sentence to a second degree murder conviction for Raymond Goedecke, a mentally-disturbed teenager who had killed his father, mother, brother, and sister. (People v. Goedecke, 65 Cal.2d 850 (1967)).\n\nWhen he entered private practice there was no public defender in San Diego. Thus, the defense of indigents depended on lawyers in private practice such as Stan to shoulder that responsibility, to which he generously devoted his time. The respect he garnered among his peers was demonstrated when the Defender Program was launched. He served as the Assistant Director until 1969, when he was appointed the Executive Director.\n\nThe high regard in which Stan was held by the legal community was memorialized after his death by the establishment of the E. Stanley Conant award. This award recognizes a defense attorney who has distinguished him/herself in the “unselfish dedication to protecting the rights of the indigent accused.”\n\nTom Adler, one of the young attorneys Stan hired, wrote of him: “It was early in 1973. I’d been a lawyer less than a year and was learning the ropes as a staff attorney at the Defenders Program in San Diego. The head of the office was a fiery old Irish trial lawyer, Stan Conant, who didn’t try cases any longer but was content administering the office and trying to keep his flock of young attorneys from getting into too much trouble. He was widely respected by everyone in and out of the office as having tried 16 death penalty cases and losing only one. He never talked about the wins but often recalled the one he lost by recounting the moment that the jury filed into the courtroom with their verdict and all twelve were crying. Every time he told the story he had the same pained look on his face. He was a guy who really cared. The story always ended with his face breaking into a smile as he wryly said, “It was reversed on appeal.”\n\nHon. Robert W. Conyers\n\n1917-2011\n\nRobert Whaley Conyers was born on September 5, 1917 in the small farming community of Cando, North Dakota. Conyer’s grandfather was among the pioneer settlers who named the town “to show you that we can do it.” In 1919, his father bought a lemon grove in Chula Vista. Conyers worked in the orchard every summer through his last year of law school. He graduated from Sweetwater High School during the height of the Great Depression. He attended San Diego State College (now SDSU), which had just relocated to its new campus on Montezuma Mesa. Conyers graduated with a B.A. in business administration in 1938. He then moved north to attend the University of California’s Berkeley Law School. He was a member of Phi Delta Phi – a prestigious international legal fraternity open to those “whose moral compass, academic ability, and personal integrity is beyond reproach.” World War II interrupted his legal career. He traveled the United States as an FBI special agent investigating domestic espionage cases. Once the war ended, Conyers entered private practice with his friend Lowell Davies, who had just become President of the Board of Directors for the Old Globe Theatre. After three years, he joined the larger firm of Higgs, Fletcher, and Mack. He took “whatever walked in the door,” including the defense of an osteopathic physician who stole a newborn after telling the mother that the child died.\n\nIn 1957, Conyers was called as a defense witness in the notorious Ruth Latham kidnapping and attempted murder trial. The two women accused of burying Mrs. Latham alive in the desert shifted attention to the victim’s husband, a wealthy investment manager with an unsavory past. Based upon his experience as a FBI agent, Conyers testified that George Latham had a “bad” reputation in the community. The defendants were acquitted.\n\nConyers served as President of the San Diego County Bar Association in 1958.\n\nIn 1959, Governor “Pat” Brown appointed Conyers to the Superior Court. The docket reflected the rapid growth of the region. Each judge disposed of over 1,000 cases a year. Civil cases waited more than a year for a jury trial. The backlog was complicated by space limitations – there were 17 departments but only 10 courtrooms. To handle the overflow, the court remodeled the second floor of the San Diego Hotel (the current site of the federal court annex). There, Conyers took the oath of office on October 1, 1959. His then-father-in-law, Municipal Court Judge Eugene C. Haney Jr. spoke on Conyers’ behalf: “He is a man of many parts. He will bring to the court the zeal and zest of youth tempered with human kindness.” (SD Union 10/2/59)\n\nIn 1964, he was appointed to the Superior Court Appellate Department, which reviewed cases from the municipal and justice courts. In 1976, he was named presiding judge of that department. But Conyers preferred trial work, where he “deal[t] directly with the human problem” that was the “life blood of the law.” (SD Union 10/10/76). When critics complained that judges were too soft on crime, Judge Conyers responded with these eloquent words:\n\nWe are charged with keeping the balance between the prosecutor’s zeal and the defendant’s soul; the victim’s cry and the wrongdoer’s tears; and the balance between the taxpayers’ purse and the taxpayers’ outrage. We can only say to you that within the limits of our own humanity, our own outrage, and our own tears, we are working professionally to accomplish a peaceful, secure society for all of us.\n\nDuring his twenty years on the bench, he handled major murder, rape, and fraud cases. He presided over several capital cases, including the second penalty trial of Robert Anderson (the case in which the California Supreme Court would find that the death penalty violated the State Constitution), and the bench trial of the handyman who brutally murdered retired stage actress Marie Chapman. Judge Conyers also handled the Yellow Cab scandal. After being acquitted of bribery, Mayor Curran pilloried the grand jury. Judge Conyers took the unusual step of calling a news conference to defend the honest and “good citizens” who served “without any political motive or ambition” against the Mayor’s “invective.” (SD Union 1971). Conyers also criticized the White House for preventing an IRS agent from testifying about public corruption. (SD Union 10/10/76)\n\nIn 1971, Judge Conyers held a “public morals” statute unconstitutional as applied to adult movies shown at the Gaiety Theater. In 1974, Judge Conyers dismissed an action charging two men with oral copulation as a “public offense” on the ground that it was private, non-harmful adult conduct. People v. Baldwin, 37 Cal. App. 3d 385 (1974) (reversed on appeal).\n\nShortly before retiring in 1979, Conyers presided over the eight-month jury trial of C. Arnholdt Smith. Smith had been a prominent civic leader, owner of the Padres franchise, and a close adviser to Richard Nixon. The jury convicted Smith of embezzling $8.9 million from his own United States National Bank. Judge Norbert Ehrenfreund recalls the sentencing hearing when Judge Conyers looked the defendant in the eye and said, \"Mr. Smith, you are a crook.\" \"That simple, blunt remark was very important. The people of San Diego wanted to hear it. That was a great relief to the thousands of defrauded investors,” according to Judge Ehrenfreund. (SDUT 12/3/11).\n\nHe was known for his keen sense of humor. Conyers believed that a “light joke” could break the inevitable tension in the courtroom. “So long as you don’t make a joke at anyone’s expense” and treat matters “consistent with the underlying dignity and purposefulness,” Conyers believed everyone benefitted. (SD Union 10/10/76). Judge Louis M. Welsh observed that “his opinions are pithy and frequently witty.” (SD Union 9/29/79). All of his colleagues agreed that Conyers was “a legal scholar,” “very bright,” and “a real gentleman.” (Id.) Judge Conyers looked forward to retirement with his third wife, a former court reporter. “I have an enormous appetite for so many things in life that I’ve never had time to taste.” (Id.)\n\nJudge William B. Enright describes Conyers as one of the “most brilliant and wisest jurists in San Diego County.” As a prosecutor and defense attorney, Enright \"tried many serious criminal cases in front of Judge Conyers, and I had enormous respect for him. We do a lot of very hard things to people when we sentence them, but the thing I learned from Judge Conyers is that I would never, never do anything to diminish the dignity and self-respect of the man I was sentencing. He was always very fair. He was very conscious of the rights of a defendant and also society's right to be protected against barbarism.\" (SDUT 12/3/11).\n\nConyers died at the age of 94 on November 27, 2011. He has one son, Jeffrey, from his first marriage.\n\nDavid Curnow\n\n1942-2017\n\nDavid Pearce Curnow was born on October 1, 1942 in Alhambra, California. After graduating from Burbank High School, Dave obtained an AA degree in 1962 from Los Angeles Valley College, and then obtained a BA degree in 1964 from Redlands University, with a triple major in Political Science, Sociology, and Economics. Dave obtained his JD from U.C. Berkeley School of Law.\n\nFollowing his graduation from U.C. Berkeley in 1967, Dave joined the United States Army Reserves. After completing basic training, Dave joined the United States Department of Justice as an Assistant United States Attorney, first in Los Angeles and then in San Diego.\n\nDave practiced in San Diego for 41 years, from 1973 through 2014. He spent 27 years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and served as the Chief of the Fraud Section and Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section. Dave also spent 14 years in private practice as a partner with Amos & Curnow, Jennings, Engstrand & Henrickson, and Sullivan, McWilliams, Lewin & Markham.\n\nDave was both an accomplished trial lawyer who tried more than 100 cases to a jury, and a skilled appellate lawyer who has 91 published opinions to his credit, including one in the United States Supreme Court.\n\nWhen not practicing law, Dave was an avid outdoorsman and triathlete. In 1988, Dave was involved in a tragic accident when his bicycle was struck from behind by a motorist whose car had drifted into the bicycle lane. The accident left Dave paralyzed from his chest down, and he was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Dave overcame his disability, however, and practiced for another 24 years litigating criminal appeals in the Appellate Division of the United States Attorney’s Office.\n\nDave’s passion for the triathlon remained, and he became involved with the Challenged Athletes Foundation and played an instrumental role in having the triathlon admitted as an Olympic sport. After retiring from the practice of law in 2014, Dave volunteered with Casa de Amistad as a tutor and mentor to disadvantaged youth. Dave passed away on December 20, 2017.\n\nHon. Thomas Graham Duffy\n\n1927-2011\n\nJudge Duffy, a long-time resident of East County, was a graduate of Grossmont High School, San Diego State University and Hastings College of Law. He served as City Attorney for the City of El Cajon while in private practice. He was appointed to the El Cajon Municipal Court in 1967 by Governor Ronald Reagan and to the Superior Court in 1980 by Governor Jerry Brown. He served with enthusiasm and commitment and was Presiding Judge of both courts.\n\nWhile an El Cajon Municipal Court Judge he engaged with the Supervising Deputy District Attorney to create a diversion and education program for young persons arrested for petty theft-shoplifting. This coordination also produced a “drunk driving” program for first time offenders which included deferred prosecution based upon alcohol treatment and awareness programs, commitment to 90 AA meetings in 90 days all prior to the State’s enactment of “SB-38”. The efforts in dealing with alcohol related offenses led to pre-sentencing screenings and programs that touched not only the offenders but those of their families.\n\nEver the innovator, Judge Duffy encouraged the early disposition of criminal cases both prior to and after the preliminary examination. The success of this program, again in conjunction with the District Attorney’s Office, led to the court coordination demonstration known as the “El Cajon Experiment.” The success of this effort led to the ultimate unification of the Municipal and Superior Courts statewide.\n\nJudge Duffy was a tireless worker and an innovator. He had a complete honesty and good-heartedness about him which complimented his dedication to an efficient and fair system of justice.\n\nOne anecdote: On request of defense counsel Judge Duffy permitted the defendant to sit in the audience to test the ability of the witness to identify the suspect. When asked to identify the suspect the witness said that she could do so, it was the one man in the back with his hand raised.\n\nGene Dukette\n\n1888-1962\n\nOne of the trusted and loyal associates of the capable and long-time District Attorney Thomas Whelan. He served as a Deputy District Attorney under both Tom Whelan and James Don Keller.\n\nHis early years were spent as a civil trial lawyer in the Los Angeles area. He had a flourishing practice and represented many prominent theatrical personages of the 1930s and early 1940s. Seeking a change in his practice, and challenged by the remarkably gifted Thomas Whelan, Dukette entered public service as a prosecutor.\n\nHis courtly manner and affable personality made him a force to be reckoned with in the trial courts of the county. He tried every kind of criminal case with great success over his lengthy career. His modesty, deference, and innate kindness impacted the lives of all who knew him. Dukette’s influence on other prosecutors in his office was legendary.\n\nAt the time of his passing in August 1962, he was remembered in Dicta – the sole lawyer magazine of the time, in the following language: “Not long ago there was a squib in the column about the lunch meeting arranged and held by a group of friends of Gene Dukette. It was a pleasant affair, and in retrospect takes on an added glow. By now you have all heard of Duke’s death late in August, and those of us who were present to greet him at the lunch are delighted that we held the function at the time and in the manner that we did. One of the high points was a description by Duke himself at how he felt to be among his friends and associates, swapping stories and recalling old times. The atmosphere was nostalgic without being maudlin, and Duke said that it was akin to a description he once heard applied to the act of making love: you have a lot of fun, but nobody laughs. All of us who have been associated with the D.A.’s office during the time Duke was there, as well as many whom he opposed in trial through the years, will think of Duke with only the warmest of memories. Our profession will never be so over-stocked with good men that we can afford to lose one such as Duke.” (Dicta, October 1962, p.12).\n\nHis life was a compelling portrait of a thoroughly good and decent man – a man of great honor in his profession.\n\nHon. Norbert Ehrenfreund\n\n1921-2016\n\nNorbert Ehrenfreund was born on October 13, 1921, in Peekskill, New York, the son of Jewish immigrants. He went to the University of Missouri and graduated with a BA in Journalism in 1943. He served in the army during World War II winning a bronze star at the Battle of the Bulge while fighting with Patton‘s army. He was involved in the liberation of Concentration Camps and after the war served as a reporter with Stars and Stripes from 1945 through 1949. While a reporter for Stars and Stripes, Norbert covered the Nuremberg trials. Many years later he wrote a book titled the Nuremberg Legacy, about the role of the rule of law. The first trial involved the accusation of crimes against humanity which was an important milestone in international law.\n\nAfter the war, Norbert obtained a Masters degree in Political Science from Columbia University in 1950. Thereafter, based on the impact the Nuremberg trials had on him, Norbert attended Stanford University Law School and obtained an LLB degree in 1959. Norbert worked for the San Diego District Attorneys office from 1960 through 1968 as a deputy DA. In 1968, he helped found the Defenders Program of San Diego, Inc. and was its first Chief Trial Attorney. Defenders was the first office in San Diego to provide legal services to the indigent accused. Norbert worked with Defenders Inc. from 1968 through 1975, when he was appointed to the San Diego Superior Court by Governor Jerry Brown.\n\nNorbert served on the San Diego Superior Court From 1975 through 1995 in many capacities. He spent years were in a criminal trial department, the mental health unit, and in juvenile court. While serving In the domestic court, he helped with the creation of California's Domestic Violence Prevention Act. After retiring from the Superior Court, Norbert served by assignment in the San Diego and Sacramento Superior Court.\n\nOff the bench, Norbert was very active in the legal community. He was on the Board of the San Diego Psych-Law Society, was involved with Volunteers In Parole, and was a great supporter of Delancey Street, a program for ex-offenders with the substance abuse problems. Norbert was recognized with the Award of Judicial Excellence from the National Conference of State Trial Judges In 2001 and received the Trial Judge of the year award in 1983 from the San Diego Trial Lawyers Association. Throughout his life, Norbert was involved with the theater, and acted in a number of performances in San Diego County including leading roles in Inherit The Wind and Death of a Salesman to name a few. He also spoke in San Diego, across the United States, and in Europe on the subject of the Holocaust. During some of his presentations on the Holocaust, Norbert would have a Holocaust survivor with him, and he would do a direct examination of that individual to educate his audience. In addition to the Nuremberg Legacy, Norbert wrote two additional books, You Be The Judge and You're The Jury. He died in San Diego County at the age of 95 on December 23, 2016.\n\nNorbert Ehrenfreund cared deeply about the right to a fair trial and spent his career trying to improve our system of justice. He also believed in rehabilitation and worked toward the goal of insuring our criminal justice system would provide a way for those convicted of crime to successfully reintegrate into the community. Norbert had a tremendous impact on the criminal justice system and our society.\n\nJeffery G. Elias\n\n1947-2018\n\nJeff was born in Akron, Ohio in 1947 and moved to Sherman Oaks when he was two years old. Jeff made the Southland his home:? attending public schools, obtaining his Batchelor’s degree at UCLA and his JD at Loyola Law School. Jeff ‘s career began at the Los Angeles Public Defender’s Office where he spent 11 years, rising through the ranks to become a felony trial lawyer in the Criminal Courts in Santa Monica. Although his?responsibilities included training new lawyers, assigning cases and community relations, his forte was representing people suffering with mental illness.\n\nWhen San Diego created its first Public Defender office in 1988, one of the first persons Frank Bardsley hired was Jeff Elias. Bardsley was a colleague of Jeff’s from the Los Angeles Public Defender’s office and recognized Jeff’s special expertise in representing people suffering with mental illness.\n\nJeff was immediately installed as Supervising Attorney of the Mental Health Unit. The Mental Health Unit became the exclusive public entity designated to handle all involuntary civil commitments, including LPS matters, for San Diego County. Jeff’s responsibilities included staff development, supervision, case management and community relations. Through Jeff’s leadership, the Unit developed into a respected partner in this specialized forensic community. He was a resource for other attorneys and agencies, advising on procedures relating to mental health issues and psychiatric defenses. In addition, he helped to develop and continued to be a team member for the Behavioral Health Court, functioning as the principal screener and the legal representative for all participants. Jeff retired on December 6, 2012 and continued working with agencies, individuals, and organizations as a consultant about mental health law, involuntary civil commitments, community reentry programs and behavioral health courts.\n\nJeff was a well-known and well-respected member of the forensic mental health community.? He was President of the San Diego Psych-Law Society, Chair for the Board of Directors for Mental Health America of San Diego County and received the Outstanding Community Servant Award from the Board of Supervisors of San Diego County. Jeff’s many contributions on behalf of his clients was recognized in Sacramento with the State Senate Award, Governor’s Award and Certificate of Appreciation from the California Legislative Assembly, and in Washington where he received a Certificate of Appreciation from the U.S. House of Representatives. Jeff enjoyed reaching out to students and encouraging them to take up the cause of?mental health awareness and was a frequent guest lecturer at UCLA, USC, UCSD, SDSU, USD and Cal Western School of Law.\n\nJohn Hart Ely\n\n1938-2003\n\nJohn Ely was born in New York City and raised in both California and New York. He served in the U.S. Army and graduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School. As a summer clerk at Arnold, Fortas, & Porter, a Washington, D.C. law firm, he assisted Abe Fortas in the landmark case of Gideon v. Wainwright (1961). Ely wrote a first draft of a brief on behalf of Clarence Earl Gideon, a Florida drifter who had been tried and convicted without a lawyer. As recounted in the famous book Gideon's Trumpet by Anthony Lewis, Gideon had scrawled his petition for certiorari from a prison cell in his own handwriting. The Supreme Court ruled in Gideon's favor.\n\nHe studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science as a Fulbright Scholar the year before he moved to San Diego and was employed by Defenders, Inc. Ely served as the second youngest staff member of the Warren Commission (at age 25), which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He went on to clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren on the Supreme Court, whom he considered a hero, and to whom he dedicated his landmark book, Democracy and Distrust (1980).\n\nFor a brief time in the 1960's, John Ely worked in San Diego with Defenders, Inc. Joining the faculty of Yale Law School in 1968, and moving to Harvard Law School in 1973, Ely wrote several influential law review articles. Ely's most notable work was his 1980 book Democracy and Distrust, which ranks as one of the most influential works about Constitutional law ever written. In it, he argues against \"interpretivism\" of which Hugo Black was an exponent, \"originalism\" advanced by Robert Bork, and \"textualism\" advanced by Antonin Scalia. His contention was \"strict construction\" fails to do justice to the open texture of many of the Constitution's provisions. At the same time, though, he maintains that the notion that judges may infer broad moral rights and values from the Constitution is radically undemocratic whether the \"moralism\" of Ronald Dworkin or the libertarian Richard Epstein. Instead, Ely argued the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution so as to reinforce democratic processes and popular self-government. This interpretation style ensured equal representation in the political process. Kathleen Sullivan described Ely’s Democracy and Distrust as “a masterpiece that combines elegant theory, raffish wit and a heartfelt search to get the role of the Supreme Court in American democracy just right.” (LA Times, 11/2/03).\n\nA former student in his constitutional law class described Ely as “deeply read, witty, unaffected, plain-speaking, creative, and pragmatically wise.” (Daniel Kornstien, New York Law Journal, 9/23/93).\n\nHe went on to serve as dean of Stanford Law School from 1982 to 1987, and remained on the faculty until 1996. He moved to the University of Miami School of Law in 1996 and was on its faculty when he died of cancer, aged 64. At the time of his death, his son Robert D. Ely stated that “He fought hard for those people who were under-represented in government because of their race, religion, and their economic or political situation. That is what he stood for.” (Miami Herald, 10/27/03).\n\nHon. William B. Enright\n\n1925-2020\n\nOn March 7, 2020, William B. Enright, one of the finest trial lawyers in San Diego history and perhaps its most influential trial judge, passed away at the age of 94. A gifted speaker with a sharp intellect and indomitable spirit, Judge Enright was committed to the highest ethical standards and utmost civility in the practice of law. He was a revered leader of San Diego’s trial bar and judiciary.\n\nJudge Enright was born on July 12, 1925, in Queens, New York. When he was just 12 years-old, his father passed away. At age 17, after graduating from high school and with his mother’s permission, he enlisted in the United States Navy where he was assigned to the Marcus Island, a carrier escort, in the Pacific Theater of World War II. At the war’s end, in August 1945, he became part of the force that occupied Japan—“leaving as man,” he would say, 37 months after enlistment.\n\nAfter his discharge, Judge Enright received his Bachelor’s Degree in philosophy from Dartmouth College and attended Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. During that time, he married the “love of his life,” Bette, with whom he shared 68 years of marriage. Together, they raised three exceptional children, one of whom is a distinguished San Diego Superior Court judge.\n\nJudge Enright’s first job after graduation from law school was with the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office, starting in 1951. Three years later, he and several other county prosecutors started their own firm where Judge Enright spent much of the next two decades doing criminal defense work. He tried 223 cases to jury verdict over 22 years, and “built a reputation as one of the most formidable trial lawyers in San Diego and in the State of California,” according to his colleague on the federal bench, Senior District Judge Larry A. Burns. Attorneys would come from all over to watch the legendary trial lawyer in action. The “clocks stopped” when Judge Enright delivered his closing arguments, said former Chief Deputy District Attorney and Superior Court Judge Lou Boyle, who often watched the trial lawyer in action. Judge Enright’s prowess as a trial lawyer was recognized by his induction as a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and as a Diplomat of the American Board of Trial Advocates, two prestigious, invitation-only, national trial organizations.\n\nJudge Enright’s commitment to trial advocacy, however, did not prevent him from participating in other aspects of legal and civic life. Indeed, he served as president of the San Diego County Bar Association in 1965, vice-president of the California State Bar Association in 1970, and president of Defenders, Inc. in 1972. He was also actively involved with the Rotary Club, United Crusade, Big Brothers, Little League, and Urban Coalition.\n\nOn June 13, 1972, at age 47, Judge Enright was nominated to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on June 28, 1972. Judge Enright served for 47 years on the bench—28 years as an active and senior judge, and nearly 20 years in emeritus status. He presided over more than 300 criminal and civil jury trials, and was widely respected as a knowledgeable and fair judge who ran a no-nonsense court. Judge Enright also served on 17 different judicial governance committees at the circuit and national levels, including a stint on the Judicial Panel for Multi-District Litigation.\n\nJudge Enright was among a small group of judges and lawyers who worked with Chief Justice Warren Burger of the United States Supreme Court to found the American Inns of Court in 1980, an organization devoted to fostering excellence in professionalism, ethics, civility, and legal skills. Today, there are more than 350 chartered American Inns of Court in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Judge Enright was a founding member of San Diego’s first Inn of Court, the Louis Welsh Inn (No. 9), and he assisted with the formation of many other Inns at both the state and national levels. He served as Trustee for the American Inns of Court Foundation upon its formation in 1985 until 1992, where he was one of ten Emeritus Trustees.\n\nIn 1987, the American Inns of Court Foundation awarded Judge Enright the Chairman’s Award for his “distinguished, exceptional and significant leadership to the American Inns of Court movement.” He was the only Californian to receive the award. Thereafter, he received the Professionalism Award for the U.S. Ninth Circuit from the American Inns of Court. In 1991, the William B. Enright American Inn of Court was chartered in San Diego, a recognition he regarded as the highest honor ever bestowed on him.\n\nThrough example and word, Judge Enright led the San Diego federal bench to better administer justice and serve its community. According to Judge Enright’s close friend and colleague on the federal bench, Senior District Judge Jeffrey T. Miller, Judge Enright was “our navigational star, the heart, soul and voice of the bench for decades, and the universal ambassador of our legal profession.” Until his death, Judge Enright remained an enthusiastic participant at the Court’s Monday Judges Meetings, a tradition he helped start given his firm belief that regularly “breaking bread” with colleagues and discussing the business of the Court fostered collegiality and camaraderie. Whistling down the hall, he was well-known for entering the judges’ conference room with a huge smile, and booming, “Well, well, well!” He infused every meeting with laughter, good cheer, and sage advice. He uplifted everyone, and always made his colleagues feel special. He was the Court’s leader to the very end.\n\nA big believer in judicial independence, Judge Enright would tell his colleagues at the judges’ meetings, “Be fiercely independent. As judges, we have the power to do not what we want, but what is right and just under the law.” On maintaining civility in the courtroom, he advised: “Like water rising, you will get exactly that level of incivility that you tolerate.” On efficiency in trying cases and respect for jurors’ time, he informed his colleagues of the admonition he gave counsel before trial: “prune your own tree, for if you don’t, I will.” And on the majesty of trial by jury, he declared: “I believe in the adversary system. John Milton said, ‘Let truth and falsehood meet in open combat; you need not fear for truth.’ If you believe in democracy, as we all do, a jury is a microcosm of democracy.”\n\nThe tradition of the Monday Judges Meeting continues today and is a hallmark of the Court, which has developed a reputation as one of the most collegial and efficient courts among the nation’s 94 district courts. Prior to his passing, in a fitting tribute, his colleagues named the judges’ conference room atop the United States Courthouse in San Diego the William B. Enright Conference Room.\n\nIn 2008, Judge Enright founded the San Diego Criminal Justice Memorial. It is only fitting that he joins fellow distinguished colleagues as an inductee. On forming the Memorial, Judge Enright noted of the inductees: “They are part of the rich tradition and proud heritage of our community’s bench and bar. We acknowledge them for their contributions, dedication, and service. We do so to inspire present and future generations to honorable service in our adversary system. The current generation, and those to come, stand on the shoulders of the accomplishments of these fine men and women. Their dedicated participation in the justice system helped make our court system the envy of the world.” Inscribed on the granite Memorial plaque that lists the names of the inductees are Judge Enright’s words: “While we live, so will they.”\n\nIn tribute to Judge Enright, Judge Miller notes that “some people are born into this world with a sense of indebtedness for the blessing of being alive, with a sense of moral responsibility to serve both other people and the institutions we venerate. Bill Enright was such a man.” True to his words on the Memorial plaque, Judge Enright lives on through his family, colleagues, and friends, and through his significant and lasting contributions to the local, state, and national legal communities, and the San Diego community, at large. The embodiment of the Greatest Generation, Judge Enright possessed a kindness and chivalry and a classical devotion to service, honor, and duty—leaving an indelible mark. His peerless character, wisdom, and generosity will forever serve as an example and inspiration.\n\nClifford K. Fitzgerald\n\n1896-1971\n\nClifford Fitzgerald was born in Chicago in 1896. The family moved to San Diego in 1904. He attended Sherman grammar school and the San Diego Army and Navy Academy. He graduated as a senior cadet officer with the rank of Captain and Adjutant. Clifford graduated from Officers Training School in San Fernando and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. After leaving the service, he studied law at the University of Southern California. He was admitted to the Bar in 1920. Clifford practiced law with his wife, an attorney, and his brother, later the Honorable Roy Fitzgerald.\n\nClifford was a trial lawyer par excellence, a defense counsel always in demand. A great cross-examiner, he was noted for his defense skills in the local military unit. He achieved an outstanding reputation as a trial lawyer – especially noted for his ability to conduct comprehensive voir dire examinations of prospective jurors that laid the groundwork for his defense case. He was thought to have no equal in this regard. In one celebrated case involving a state public official accused of taking kickbacks from his secretary’s salary, Fitzgerald’s masterful voir dire examination of a large panel of jurors and a creative defense of “a woman scorned” led to an very unexpected acquittal. Who can say as to the justice of the decision given the strong paper trail of invoices and the secretary’s testimony against her boss, but the lawyerly skills on behalf of his client was amply demonstrated.\n\nHis representation was particularly sought by members of the United States Naval Service. Both officers and enlisted personnel retained Fitzgerald’s services in general court martial proceedings, as well as in the civilian courts. He had the very unique characteristic of demonstrating his concern for his client’s welfare by invariably sitting patiently in the back of the trial courtroom with his client to await the jury’s decision. Whether that be hours or days, Fitzgerald would sit alone until the final resolution of the matter.\n\nHe left his mark on all who witnessed his court presence, his remarkable abilities, and his high professional standards. He passed away on April 4, 1971.\n\nWilliam R. \"Bill\" Fletcher\n\n1949-2006\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Fletcher was born October 9, 1949 in Downey, California and grew up in Southern California. Bill received his J.D. from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1975. He began representing indigent criminal defendants in state court as a staff attorney for the Defenders Program of San Diego, Inc. In 1979, Bill went into private practice representing both indigents and retained clients in the state and federal court.\n\nHis law partner, C. Bradley Patton, described the sharp legal mind that lurked behind Fletcher’s laid-back demeanor: “He was a folksy kind of guy who could lull you into believing he was a good ‘ol boy,’ then he would hit you over the head with a key piece of evidence.” (SDUT 3/25/06). “One of the remarkable things about Bill was that he was friends with many prosecutors, along with Sheriff’s deputies, judges, and court personnel. Most criminal defense lawyers hunker down with their own kind. It’s unusual that an individual can set aside day-to-day issues and reach out to the other side. But it came naturally to Bill.” (Id.) “Bill was a people’s attorney and an attorney’s attorney.” (Id. quoting Patricia Robinson).\n\nThe Criminal Defense Bar Association of San Diego named Fletcher as Criminal Defense Attorney of the Year in 1988 and again in 2005. His distinguished record of high profile cases including defending Richard Tuite, a mentally-disturbed transient, of killing twelve-year old Stephanie Crowe throughout a complex, six-year legal battle. In 2000, he defended teenager Danielle Barcheers in her retrial for the stabbing death of Betty Carroll. In 1990, he represented a former teacher’s aide who paid two Escondido high school students to kill her husband and persuaded the jury to reject the death penalty. He tried countless complex rape, murder, and other serious felony cases throughout the county.\n\nFletcher was active with the San Diego County Bar Association and served as President of the Criminal Defense Lawyer’s Club.\n\nHon. Earl B. Gilliam\n\n1931- 2001\n\nBorn in Clovis, New Mexico, Gilliam’s family moved to Oklahoma City during the depths of the Depression. In 1941, during the military buildup to World War II, his family brought him in the fifth grade to San Diego, where he spent the rest of his life near his family home on Imperial Avenue. The home was not far from his father’s business, which imported fresh water fish from Louisiana to sell to wholesalers, restaurants, and customers. He attended San Diego High School, where he was involved in gymnastics, football, basketball, and track. He would later open his private practice in the 2800 block of Imperial Avenue. Throughout his life, Gilliam would stroll that neighborhood greeting the many friends and residents. In 2005, the Post Office named its Imperial Avenue branch in his honor.\n\nEarl Gilliam received his Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State College in 1953 and J.D. from Hastings College of Law in San Francisco in 1957. That same year he began his legal career as a deputy district attorney in the San Diego District Attorney Office. In 1961, Gilliam went into private practice. He handled many pro bono criminal defense cases from his office, which he described as one of the first “storefront” law firms.\n\nHe became a judge of the San Diego Municipal Court in 1963.
