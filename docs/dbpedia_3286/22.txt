Hector Jones, also known as Green Goblin, is a hero on Counter-Earth.

Biography[]

Green Goblin initially mistakes Spider-Man for the person responsible for the kidnapping of Naoko Yamada-Jones and her son, Shane. But Spider-Man convinces him otherwise and the two unlikely allies go after the true villains; Venom and Carnage. Even after Naoko and Shane are rescued, Spider-Man and the Goblin continue to question each other's motives.

It is greatly implied that the Goblin is actually Naoko's ex-husband, Hector and Shane's father. Before his disappearance, Hector Jones became increasingly sympathetic to the resistance. He was also a highly skilled inventor, capable of creating the Goblin's gear. It is likely that he is protecting his family by going into exile - keeping them separate from his life as a vigilante and rebel.

Hector eventually grows concerned with Peter Parker living with Naoko and Shane, and attacked him. He placed cameras in the basement and later discovered that Peter and Spider-Man were one and the same!. The two are both taken prisoner by a group of beastials called the "Rejects" (because the High Evolutionary literally rejected them from society) and pretend to aid them as a means of escape. During the escape, the Goblin is believed killed in an explosion.

It was later revealed that this wasn't true and the Goblin returned to help Spider-Man, and the rebels battle the High Evolutionary one last time.
