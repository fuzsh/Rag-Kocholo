        "text": "The Man-Monster aka the Smasher was a small-time crook, who was turned into a super-human by Dr. Thaxton, a scientist working for Richard Raleigh. At Raleigh's command, the man-monster rampaged through Manhattan, targetting especially Raleigh billboards, in order to portray Raleigh, who was running for Mayor, as an enemy of the underworld. This plot was foiled by Spider-Man. Raleigh next sent the Man-Monster out to kill George Stacy and was again stopped by Spider-Man, who led the Man-Monster back to Raleigh's apartment. He killed his own employer, after which he was killed himself by Spider-Man.\n\nThe second criminal Spider-Man ever faced (after the Burglar), Conrad Eisenstadt, alias The Undertaker, was the head of a small gang that performed petty con games, as well as the disposal of murder victims for organized crime. One of the Undertaker's confidence tricksters approached Aunt May, saying that Uncle Ben had ordered some furniture as a gift before his death and that there was an outstanding payment. May and Peter decided to come up with the money some how. Later, however, Peter came across the same confidence trickster using the same ploy as earlier and followed him back to the Undertaker's lair. When Spider-Man threatened to call the police, the Undertaker had his men try to shoot him. Spider-Man defeated them all and called the police, who arrested the Undertaker and his men for multiple counts of murder, conspiracy and fraud.\n\nThomas Agar's company, Agar Ores, swindled the country of Wakanda out of five hundred million dollars in a deal involving bad Tungsten. He was soon sued for fraud. In order to get out of paying Wakanda the money back, Agar hired Hellrazor to impersonate the Black Panther and kidnap him. On a Monday morning, Thomas Agar was hounded by the press outside of the court where he was due at a preliminary hearing concerning his swindling of Wakanda. One reporter asked him if the swindling charges were true and Agar replied that they were an unsubstantiated rumor. He then explained that the government wanted Wakanda's vibranium and that he was not going to let some punk little country push him around. At that point, the \"Black Panther\" jumped down from a tree and attacked Agar. Peter Parker, who had been in the crowd, tried to stop the \"Black Panther\" but was punched in the face as the \"Panther\" grabbed Agar and flew away in a helicopter. Much later, after Spider-Man and the real Black Panther had defeated Hellrazor, who had been impersonating the Black Panther, the duo visited the offices of Thomas Agar. Thomas had been listening to the radio reports of T'Challa being called in for questioning and thinking that Hellrazor was entering his office, mentioned that Hellrazor did good work even if he didn't kill T'Challa. Agar soon turned around to see the real Black Panther and Spider-Man.The Black Panther demanded a check from Agar for five hundred million dollars to cover the amount that Agar had swindled out of Wakanda and Agar was soon arrested (Marvel Team-Up I#87).\n\nArcade grew up in a wealthy household and had the perfect \"richie\" life until his father cut off his allowance. Because of that, Arcade murdered his father and inherited the family fortune. He later became a freelance assassin taken out his victims in a rather mundane colorful fashion which made him even richer. He got bored with assassinating and being a hired gun. So he built Murderworld which was intended to kill in a entertaining way. He is known for giving his victims a small chance of survival and escape, just for the sport of it.\n\nAndrew Booth was a former mercenary soldier almost killed by an explosion in Angola. He was rebuilt by persons unknown as a cyborg killer renamed Assassin-8 and became a professional assassin. Later, a mysterious man convinced the unstable Booth that Spider-Man, who was then visiting Britain to appear on the TV show Saturday Starship, had planted the bomb which had taken his humanity, and sent him after Spider-Man as a way of 'testing' the hero for reasons of his own. Spider-Man escaped after damaging Booth's bionic arm. Fighting Spider-Man again days later in the London Underground system, Booth was killed instantly when he accidentally stumbled onto the electrified rail which conducted a powerful charge through the metal in his body.\n\nHaving apparently beaten the rap and moved out of the city, Aura and Override came back to New York, lured by the $5 million bounty on Spider-Man. Despite her misgivings, Aura agreed to resume their criminal careers to make enough money to retire. They ambushed Spider-Man, but he managed to maneuver Aura into blasting Override and escape in the resulting confusion. Back in their room at the Manhattan Marriot, Ann tried to convince Greg to give up, but he remained determined, and promised her that nothing would go wrong. Leaping into a confrontation between Spider-Man and the Dealy Boys, Aura blew away a cop with her force blast while Override shut down the Dealy Boy's weapons. Override opened up an 'area of operability' around Aura to allow her to ensnare Spider-Man in a force field...unaware that one of the Dealy Boys was also in that sphere. He fired his lazer at Aura, and she raised her force field an instant too late, trapping the lazer beam in it with her. The beam ricocheted about the energy bubble, tearing her apart. Later Aura was taken to a hospital in lower Manhattan.\n\nBanjo and his brother Abner (Bugeye) encountered Spider-Man, who was in the area searching for the missing Robbie Robertson. The twins mother mistakenly believed Peter to be a government agent. Distrusting the government for covering up North Mile Island, she ordered her sons to kill him. Banjo grabbed Spider-Man and tried to squeeze the life out of him. Spider-Man smashed him in the head and Banjo fell into a mineshaft while disoriented. However Spidey saved him with a web and brought the unconscious Banjo back to the village. Spidey left peacefully."
