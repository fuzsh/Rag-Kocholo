        "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI've decided to create a repository of Spider-Man's greatest feats with their sources included, since many other respect threads have broken links or don't include sources. Spider-Man is one of the best comic book characters ever, so it is time he got a respect thread worthy of him. There are going to be no limits on what can and can't be included here, so please feel free to PM me or post scans below for me to add (but please, try and provide sources for all scans)! If you can provide sources for the minority of uncited feats, that would be greatly appreciated as well. I will add your name to the credits list if you do contribute to improving this thread in any way. :)\n\nAnyways, I really hope you enjoy the thread!\n\nHow to navigate:\n\nThe headings below all contain hyper-links to their respective sections. You can click any of the main headings (the whole number ones - ex. strength or durability) to be transported directly to that section, or you can just scroll down the thread at your leisure. I have also tried to order feats in each sub-category by impressiveness, though that was obviously subjective, so your mileage may vary. If you really think something needs to be re-ordered, feel free to shoot me a PM or post down below.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nNotes:\n\nIf a feat has an asterisk in brackets following its description, as shown here: (*), then it is from a story which is either retroactively set in Spider-Man's past (such as Untold Tales of Spider-Man, or Spider-Man: Learning to Crawl) or are short-term alternate future possibilities, which means it may be debatable regarding whether it is canon or not. I haven't included feats from stories which are set in Spider-Man's past, but certainly don't occur in 616 (ex. Spidey).\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Strength\n\n1.1. Striking\n\n1.2. Lifting\n\n1.3.

You should ask to be pinpointed and you should post the content on other sites as well ! I haven't read it all yet, but did you mention the fact that in \"Kraven's Last Hunt\" he managed to get out by himself out of his own grave. He was burried alive.\n\nThank you! I'm not sure what being \"pinpointed\" is, but I may post this on other sites too if I get time. The problem is that I'm not sure if the ComicVine formatting will work on other sites, so I'd have to relink everything and that would be boring and tedious, lol.\n\nAs for Kraven's Last Hunt, while that was a good story, none of those were impressive feats for Peter (getting KOed for days by a poison, getting shown up by Kraven who is significantly weaker and less powerful, etc.). Even digging out of a grave isn't too impressive for Peter - physically. I might be able to put it in the willpower section, though. However, it's been a while since I read it, so I will go through it again to see if I can find anything. Or, if you are reading it, please feel free to post a specific instance out of that story (or any others) which showed Peter doing something impressive or out of his usual capabilities.\n\nI've just currently finished reading Peter Parker: Spider-Man, so I'm working on making scans of the best feats I found in that series (look at the post above yours), uploading them to imgur, and then posting them here. When I'm done with that, I'll move on to other issues.\n\nThanks again!"
