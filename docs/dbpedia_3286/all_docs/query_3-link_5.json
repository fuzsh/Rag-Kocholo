        "text": "Origin\n\nPeter Benjamin Parker was born to C.I.A. agents Richard and Mary Parker, who were killed when Peter was very young. After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in a modest house in Forest Hills, New York. While still in High School, Peter attended a science exhibition about radiology where he was bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider as well as a \"Spider-Sense\" that warns him of nearby danger. In order to test his new abilities - and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against Crusher Hogan. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterward while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasn't his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger, Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself. After arriving at the warehouse and easily defeating Uncle Ben's killer, Peter saw that it was the same burglar he didn't stop at the arena... thus learning that \"with great power comes great responsibility\".\n\nCreation\n\nIn 1962, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was looking for a new superhero idea. He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired by the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher Martin Goodman to introduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that issue (#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist Jack Kirby for an initial character design. However, Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby's attempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was supposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to Steve Ditko who developed the now iconic look of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is one of the first characters whose problems made him feel more real, as people could relate more to him.\n\nCharacter Evolution\n\nPeter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben's death, he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the 'boy scout' character people think; the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.\n\nHe has an extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on the said side.\n\nHe also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn't just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate periods.\n\nOne thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore, The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.\n\nThe time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the Amazing Fantasy series was continued in 1995 by writer Kurt Busiek (#16-18, Dec. 1995 - Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle's death. Even though Maxie Shiffman, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn't want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death, Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught Mr. Vale pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spider-Man followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by The Undertaker. Spider-Man challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight, he discovered his Spider-Sense for the first time. Capturing these criminals lead Peter to believe that this is how he has to make up for Uncle Ben's death, by using his powers to help others.\n\nSpider-Man became a force for good, from stopping muggings to rescuing workers at a construction site. These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn't want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility for money. His heroism had also earned Spider-Man a certain fan named Flash Thompson. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and Joey Pulaski became friends. However, it turned out that Joey was working for The Kingpin and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey's defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super-powered being Spider-Man had encountered.\n\nAfter defeating Joey Spider-Man's fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut John Jameson much to the vexation of his father, publicist J. Jonah Jameson. As the host began to introducing the show's guests he was attacked by the super-powered villain Supercharger, who announced he will kill everyone in the audience to prove how dangerous super-powered beings were. Spider-Man had never encountered a super villain before and thought real superheroes should deal with this. He attempted to call The Fantastic Four but after Supercharger attacked someone in the audience, Spider-Man stepped in and defeated his first super villain. \"because that's what superheroes do\".\n\nMajor Story Arcs\n\nBecoming a Hero\n\nPeter's first super-villain confrontation was with a communist spy called the Chameleon who could disguise himself as anyone. He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, The Vulture. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spider-Man managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw since Ock's powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape-shifting Sandman, the lethal Lizard, who is actually Peter's mentor and friend Curt Connors, the Enforcers, Electro, Mysterio, Kraven the Hunter, Doctor Doom, and his soon-to-be arch-nemesis the Green Goblin.\n\nAfter being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the Sinister Six, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man's death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping Aunt May and Betty Brant. Despite everything, Spider-Man came out victorious and saved the two hostages. On his high school graduation, Spider-Man battled the Molten Man, who would turn out to be the stepbrother of Liz Allen. During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as Daredevil, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Human Torch in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn't bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man. She later settled in with Ned Leeds.\n\nCollege Years\n\nAfter graduating from High School, Peter Parker enrolled at ESU ( Empire State University) where Flash introduced him to Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy. During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually, their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet Anna Watson's niece Mary Jane. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen's father, Police Captain George Stacy, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen's father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George's death caused a strain in the couple's relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss. She left Peter for some time to live with her uncle in London.\n\nArch-Nemesis: Green Goblin\n\nAfter suffering numerous defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin vowed to destroy his foe once and for all. Using a special gas that blocks Peter's Spider-Sense, the Goblin followed Peter around and discovered his secret identity. Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry's father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority. The Web-Slinger managed to defeat him and knocked him into some chemicals, resulting in Norman having amnesia and no recollection of both his and Peter's alternate egos.\n\nSpider-Man also fought the Rhino, Shocker, and the Scorpion. At one point, Peter felt that he was unable to carry the burden of being Spider-Man any longer and considered retiring from super-heroics. When the Kingpin of Crime made his move to take over the city, Peter knew that it was still his responsibility to protect the innocent and so he defeated this crime-lord and returned to crime-fighting.\n\nDeath of Gwen Stacy and the Aftermath\n\nAt the end of the Silver Age, Norman Osborn's memories began to flood back. He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen's dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. Gwen's death has affected Peter his entire career and is a big part of his character, as was Uncle Ben's death. He tracked the Goblin down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time Miles Warren, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the Jackal. He hired the Punisher to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter. The Peter copy escaped and Gwen's copy eventually went back to Miles. Harry Osborn followed in the footsteps of his father and became the next Green Goblin. He blamed Peter for his father's death. Harry later lost his memory after a fight with Spider-Man. Harry's psychologist, Bart Hamilton attempted to take up the mantle of the Goblin himself but was killed by his own bomb while fighting Peter.\n\nSecret Wars and the Symbiote\n\nThe Beyonder transported Spider-Man along with other heroes and villains to Battleworld to take place in the Secret Wars, an intergalactic battle between the world's greatest heroes and villains. During the battle, Spider-Man's suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a black substance that slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to Arachne's costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to Reed Richards who told him that it's actually a living alien symbiote, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and Johnny Storm, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man. Admiring the black suit's design, Spider-Man's then-girlfriend and crime-fighting partner the Black Cat made him a cloth version of the black costume which he would start using for a time. The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in Eddie Brock to become one of Spider-Man's deadliest and most recurring foes, Venom.\n\nDeath of Jean DeWolff\n\nA close friend of Peter's, Jean DeWolff was killed by a criminal called the Sin-Eater. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal. After an encounter with Sin-Eater that left an innocent bystander harmed, Peter was drawn closer to the dark side. After saving Betty Brant from the criminal, Spider-Man was tempted to kill him but was stopped by Daredevil. The two heroes captured and unmasked the criminal and in the process formed a bond of friendship and trust between each other.\n\nMarriage\n\nSometime later, Spider-Man revealed his identity to the Black Cat who would end up breaking up with him. She was unable to bear the fact that Spider-Man liked to live a civilian life as Peter Parker instead of staying in costume. Mary Jane would return to New York and she visited Peter in his apartment. Meanwhile, the Puma had tracked down Spider-Man but Peter sensed his presence using his spider-sense.\n\nFearing for MJ's safety, Peter pushes her out of the apartment so that he could fight the Puma as Spider-Man without revealing his identity to her. MJ heard the sounds of battle. After Peter defeated Puma, MJ confessed to him that she cannot handle the danger he puts himself in. She tells him that she has always known his secret identity. Black Cat appears to reconcile with Peter which caused MJ to run away crying. She considered leaving town again but she then decided to confront Peter. They became very close and they would tell each other everything. They were hiding from their true feelings and Peter proposed to MJ. Although she initially refused, after making amends with her sister, MJ returned to Peter and accepted his proposal. Despite knowing that they are still too young and Peter's double life may make things difficult, Peter and Mary Jane tied the knot.\n\nKraven's Last Hunt\n\nPeter's life did not get any easier after his wedding. As soon as he returned from his honeymoon, he was attacked by Kraven the Hunter in one of the most traumatizing events in both Peter and MJ's lives. Kraven was seeking to regain the honor that his family had lost and to do so, he must prove his superiority over his greatest foe, Spider-Man. After ambushing him, Kraven shot Peter in the head with a rifle and buried him on his grounds. Kraven donned a black Spider-Man costume and became a merciless vigilante. He even defeated Vermin, a villain Spider-Man could not defeat on his own. After two weeks, it was revealed that Spider-Man was actually alive and Kraven shot him with a tranquilizer. Peter eventually made his way to Kraven's estate and brutally pummeled the hunter. Kraven was unconcerned as he has proven his superiority over his foe before and so he set the Vermin free. After Spider-Man left Kraven to capture Vermin, Kraven killed himself.\n\nBirth of Venom and Carnage\n\nThe reporter Eddie Brock had accused the Sin-Eater as one man. He then became very angry with Spider-Man, when the web-slinger unmasked Sin-Eater and it turned out to be a different person. This caused Brock professional humiliation and the loss of his job. When Eddie bonded with the symbiote and became Venom, Eddie launched several attacks on Peter's life, even scaring MJ. Peter stopped wearing the black suit following MJ's request. Eddie's symbiote had an offspring that bonded with Cletus Kasady, a psychotic murderer, to become Carnage. Venom and Spider-Man were forced to team-up to defeat this new foe. Sometime later, Peter and Eddie formed a truce, promising never to interfere with each other's lives ever again.\n\nDeath of Harry Osborn\n\nHarry Osborn's memories of being the Green Goblin came flooding back and he attempted to ruin Peter's life one more time. Before destroying a building that contained Peter, MJ, and his son Normie, Harry regained his sanity and managed to save them. Immediately after doing so, he died from being poisoned by the Goblin Formula.\n\nMaximum Carnage\n\nAfter Harry's death, Peter decided to retire from super-heroics. After Carnage formed a team of other psychopaths and went on a bloody rampage around New York, Spider-Man was forced to team-up with his old foe Venom again. The two of them, along with other heroes, managed to stop them.\n\nPeter's Parents\n\nPeter's parents suddenly appeared in his life, claiming to have been abducted by communists. He had learned to love his \"parents\" and even revealed to them his secret identity. They turned out to be robots invented by the Chameleon to infiltrate Peter's life, discover his connections to Spider-Man and then kill him. The robot that masqueraded as Peter's father Richard was perfectly willing to accomplish his task and kill Peter, but the Mary robot had learned to love Peter and saw him as a good person. Richard turned into a vicious engine of destruction. Before Richard could finish Peter off, Mary killed him using an electric cable. In return, she was killed by the Vulture who was conspiring with the Chameleon. An enraged Spider-Man completely pummeled the Vulture but was stopped by the cries of his dying \"mother\". She told Peter in her last moments that despite everything, she still loved him. Spider-Man vowed to track down the Chameleon and make him suffer, which he eventually did after fighting through many assassins sent by the communist. Peter ultimately spared an emotionally broken Chameleon and left him for the authorities.\n\nThe Clone Saga\n\nIn the Clone Saga, a controversial story arc, the long-lost Jackal-made copy of Peter Parker returns. For years he was believed to have died after his initial encounter with the real Peter Parker. The clone, who is now calling himself Ben Reilly spent years traveling the world as he knew there was no place for him in New York City again. When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first, the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a threat, but later on, the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. It was also during this time that aunt May seemingly died of old age. Before she passed away, she told Peter that she had known about him being Spider-man for some time now. Years later, it would be revealed that it was not aunt May that had died, but a stand-in that was the work of Norman Osborn. Peter remained out of super-heroin for some time, until his powers seemingly returned and he and the Scarlet Spider fought side by side for some time. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died. On that day, Peter felt to have lost a brother. Although Norman Osborn was defeated, it was far from the last thing that was heard from him. With his powers fully returned, Peter resumed his work as the Amazing Spider-Man once again.\n\nThe Identity Crisis\n\nAfter this saga, the Identity Crisis story takes place in which Spider-Man is accused by a returned Norman Osborn of murder and a bounty is put on his head. This is done by Norman Osborn, who had cleared his name as a criminal when he proclaimed that he was not really the Green Goblin, but was set up by this criminal. He had taken over the Daily Bugle and put a price on Spider-Man's head in the newspaper. This lead to a variate of bounty-hunters to attack Spider-Man. Feeling it to dangerous for himself and his loved ones to remain the hero he is, Peter retires from being Spider-Man and forms four different identities which he uses to keep on helping people and in the meantime clear his name. Eventually, Peter's name was cleared and he returned to being Spider-Man.\n\nGathering of the Five\n\nIt seemed that Spider-man was finally back on track, with his name cleared and his life finally looking a bit better than it had in recent months. Norman Osborn however kept being a disturbing presence to Peter and Mary Jane. He started a ritual known as the Gathering of the Five, with one person getting Ultimate power, one got death, one got insanity, and so on. Norman thought he gained power, but it turned out that it was insanity that he got. He attacked and kidnapped Peter. While he was captive, Peter got the shock of a lifetime. His aunt May was standing in front of him, alive and well. After Spider-man broke free and defeated Norman Osborn, seemingly for good, as he was taken to a mental hospital, Peter learned that it was in fact aunt May he found. Not a clone, not a hoax. Norman had apparently kidnapped May years ago and had an actress surgically look like aunt May and play her part while she was dying. This was why 'aunt May' knew about Peter being Spider-Man, she was hired by Norman Osborn to play her! Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four assured Peter it was his aunt. Peter saw this as a sign and stopped being Spider-Man altogether, finally living a good life with his aunt May and his wife Mary Jane.\n\nA New Chapter in Life and a New Spider-Woman\n\nAfter Peter had his aunt returned, he decided to stop being Spider-man for good. He started living in a new apartment with his aunt May and wife Mary Jane. All of New York was wondering where Spider-Man could have gone after his seemingly final battle with the Green Goblin. He would not even react to messages send by Peter's good friend the Human Torch. Peter had found a job at a science-center where he did good work and stayed out of the superhero life, although it turned out that was harder than it seemed. It was at this time that a seemingly new Spider-Man appeared on the scene. It turned out that this was Mattie Franklin, a participant in the Gathering of the Five, who got the gift of Power. She acted as Spider-man and later as Spider-Woman when Peter finally accepted that he was needed as Spider-man and returned to life as a superhero.\n\nAll seemed to go well again until Mary Jane, who had started acting again, was threatened by a stalker. It started with phone-calls, but when Mary Jane took a plane, it exploded in mid-air and seemingly killed Mary Jane. Peter, firstly stricken with grief, did not believe she had died. He knew it must have had something to do with the stalker, and Peter started a crusade to find out the truth. This brought him to Latveria and in a fight against the Hulk among others. Eventually, Peter learned that it was indeed the stalker that had faked Mary Jane's death and had held her captive during it all. The stalker was a mutant that absorbed all of Peter's memories when he was saved by him during one of Spider-man's fights on the streets of New York. The Stalker needed Mary-Jan for himself because of it and he felled he knew her. Spider-man managed to save Mary Jane and defeat the Stalker. Mary Jane however was traumatized by the experience and needed time off from her life as the wife of a superhero. The two parted ways for some time.\n\nA Death in the Family\n\nNorman Osborn broke out of jail and managed to clear his name of being the Green Goblin. After failing to convert Peter into his heir, he started to provoke Peter into killing him in a story called A Death in the Family. Norman was sick of his life and wanted to die at the hands of Spider-man. He tried to get Peter so mad that he would do this. First by releasing footage of Gwen's death to the media, claiming that Gwen's death was the result of Spider-Man's selfish actions. To make matters worse, Norman forced a drunken Flash Thompson to have a car accident, causing him to go into a coma. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in one of Osborn's warehouses where Spider-Man defeats the Goblin. Although he urged him to finish him off, Peter refused to play the Goblin's game and proposed a truce. Norman accepts, but as he returns to one of his offices, he puts a gun in his mouth. He is however to afraid to pull the trigger.\n\nEzekiel\n\nSpider-man meets a strange individual named Ezekiel, who knows that he is truly Peter Parker, and warns him of a powerful enemy who will try to kill him, known as Morlun. Peter follows Ezekiel and tries to find out why he knows so much about him. Ezekiel tells Spider-man that he is part of a \"Spider-Totem\", which is why his enemies all are animals as well (Rhino, Lizard, Doctor Octopus, Vulture). Spider-man does not care much about these strange stories but is happy with the help that Ezekiel provides when he finally encounters Morlun. He barely defeats Morlun and struggles back home after the fight. He lands on his bed, with a torn-up Spider-man costume and falls asleep. It is at this time that aunt May enters the room and sees Peter as Spider-Man. The secret is finally out! Aunt May walks away and uses a full day to comprehend the facts before she finally confronts Peter with it. Peter tried to talk his way out of it but finally sees that it is no use and then told his aunt May about why he became Spider-Man. It was during this time that Peter and Mary Jane again renewed their relationship and their marriage vows. Marry-Jane returned to live with Peter and the two were a happy couple once more.\n\nNew Avengers\n\nDuring a riot at the Raft prison, orchestrated by Electro, Spider-Man teams up with other heroes to subdue the inmates. Since the original Avengers have disbanded, Iron Man and Captain America decided to form a new team of Avengers consisting of the heroes involved in stopping the riot, including Spider-Man.\n\nAs an Avenger, Peter has become more acquainted with the superhero community including the Fantastic Four, Hank Pym, and Doctor Strange. He trusted his fellow teammates to the point of revealing his secret identity to them. He also started working for Tony Stark at Stark Industries. When aunt May's house is destroyed by an old school-friend of Peter who had gotten superpowers, Peter, Mary Jane, and his aunt are invited by Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, to start living in Avengers Tower. Peter and his family are doubtful at first but eventually accept as a new chapter in their life begins. Peter fought the good fight with the Avengers while aunt May started a somewhat romantic relationship with the Avengers' butler Jarvis.\n\nThe Other\n\nPeter discovers that he is suffering from an unknown disease that is killing him. He seeks the help of the Marvel Universe's best scientists but none of them could help him so he decides to accept the inevitable. He is later attacked by the powerful Morlun, and after a brutal fight, the totem eater rips off Peter's eye, eats it, and continues to beat Spider-Man to his apparent death. After his body is sent to the hospital, Morlun attempts to consume him, but after an intervention from Mary Jane, whom Morlun was about to kill, Spider-Man's form suddenly changed. His eyes glow red, his teeth become razor sharp and two poison stingers sprout from his arms. Peter attacks Morlun, stabs him in the shoulder with one of his stingers, and bites him in the neck. He then apparently dies in MJ's arms. He finds himself face to face with a Spider monster who tells Peter that he has to either accept his spider side and evolve or die. Spider-Man embraces his \"other\" and recovers. He reunites with his friends and family and reveals that he has received new powers.\n\nCivil War\n\nDuring the Civil War, Spider-Man joins Iron Man's team ( and gets given an iron spider suit ) and dons a new Iron Spider costume. He supported the SHRA to the point where he even revealed his identity to the public, but as a result, his life was ruined as he is fired from his job, his old friends turn their backs on him and his loved ones become targeted by his enemies since they now know Spider-Man's secret identity. Eventually, he discovers the rogue heroes' mistreatment by the government and realizes that he sided with the wrong team so he betrays Iron Man and joins Captain America's Secret Avengers, He disregarded his suit that tony start had given him as it was prone to be hacked, and he did not want to be seen using technology tony stark had made, he reverted back to his original outfit.\n\nBack In Black\n\nAfter the war, Peter remains a fugitive and his Aunt May is shot by a sniper hired by the Kingpin. Peter finds himself in a place he has never been to before. He dons his black costume and goes on a rampage to find his aunt's shooter. May has fallen into a coma and is in critical condition. Eventually, Peter discovers that the Kingpin is the man responsible and tracks the crime-lord to Riker's Island Prison. He savagely beats Fisk to a bloody pulp but decides to leave him with his humiliating defeat as it's worse than death for Fisk. Peter warns the other inmates to stay away from his family and tells Fisk that when May dies, Peter will come back and finish him. Since Spider-Man is a fugitive, he is unable to get proper help for May and is forced to commit felonies to try and save her, before realizing that he has finally become what he has spent his life fighting, a criminal.\n\nOne More Day & Brand New Day\n\nPeter becomes desperate to save May. He makes a deal with Mephisto who offers to save his aunt and restore the secrecy of his identity in exchange for erasing Peter's marriage to MJ. Mephisto gives the couple One More Day to decide (hence the title of the story) and Peter reluctantly agrees. He then wakes up in the house of May who is alive and well with no recollection of the deal. This marks the beginning of the Brand New Day era, in which Harry Osborn is alive and Spider-Man meets new friends and foes. He fights new villains including Mister Negative, Screwball, the Spider-Mugger, Menace who is the girlfriend of Harry, Kraven's daughter Ana Kravinoff in the story Kraven's First Hunt, the New Vulture in 24/7, teams-up with Anti-Venom to fight Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts in New Ways to Die and is accused of murder during the Character Assassination story. When the Secret Invasion took place, Spider-Man helped his fellow heroes in fighting off the invading Skrulls.\n\nDark Reign\n\nAfter the Skrull invasion, the Dark Reign took hold. Norman Osborn was seen as a hero and became the leader of the world's national security, hunting down the heroes. Spider-Man attempted to stop him by infiltrating Stark Tower during the American Son story. He fought Osborn once more when he is placed on Osborn's list and managed to broadcast on the internet a video of Osborn conducting horrible experiments. He then joined Captain America in intercepting Osborn's Siege on Asgard, ending his Dark Reign. The aftermath marked the dawn of the Heroic Age in which Spidey became a member of the newly formed Avengers.\n\nAmerican Son\n\nWith help from the Invisible Woman and some of her husband's technology, Spider-Man kidnaps and imprisons Mac Gargan, (they ambushed him in an alleyway, caught him in an invisible force-field, all while Bullseye picks and eats a bogey) then poses as him to infiltrate Avengers Tower, donning a special suit made by Reed Richards, allowing him to appear as Mac Gargan with the Venom symbiote. Norman has revealed a nefarious plot to his Avengers involving his son Harry entitled \"American Son\". While alone, Spider-Man was ambushed by Daken, who claims that Peter smells too clean for Gargan. Daken attacks and uses his pheromones to shut down Peter's senses, however, Peter focuses on his spider-sense alone, and eventually defeats Daken by throwing him into an electrical machine that electrocutes and knocks out Daken. However, Harry reveals Spider-Man's disguise in front of Osborn's Avengers,(even though Norman had known it all along, and only wanted to ensure he had his son's trust) and he was held captive and tortured by Bullseye. Identity intact thanks to his unstabilized mask, he escaped (subduing Norman and Bullseye in succession out of anger). Unfortunately, Spider-Man was weakened by captivity, saved from Norman by a guilt-ridden and angry Harry, who now knew the truth about his father's relationship with Lily Hollister (Harry's girlfriend,) and began using the American Son Armor to beat up Norman. Peter watched the Osborns fight until Menace became involved, whom he incapacitated. With Harry victorious, Spider-Man convinced him not to kill Norman as it was exactly what the madman wanted.\n\nGauntlet & Grim Hunt\n\nSpider-man fights classic foes during the Gauntlet story. A plot orchestrated by the Kravinoff Family who intended to recover Kraven the Hunter, something they managed to accomplish in the Grim Hunt.\n\nDuring Grim Hunt, Peter is already weakened and exhausted from his \"gauntlet\". After a loud knocking at his apartment door and he opens it only to see his estranged clone Kaine, beaten and bloodied. Before passing out, Kaine reveals to Peter that the \"Spiders\" are being hunted. A loud explosion is heard nearby his apartment and Peter goes to check it out only to see Arachne fighting off Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff. Peter, being weakened by the swine flu, struggles to put up a fight and manages to impale Alyosha on a broken pipe, gaining him time to retrieve Arachne and to escape. After retreating to Mattie Franklin's apartment, they are approached by a dead Ezekiel. He then tells Spider-Man and Arachne that they have to save Arana from the clutches of the Kravinoff's. As they finally reach her, they become outnumbered and defeated and Arachne and Arana are captured. Kaine eventually arrives to help out but was too late to make a difference. He tries to warn Peter from following Ezekiel but Peter lashes out in anger and the two set off to find Kraven's base.\n\nWhen they finally reach the base, Chameleon reveals himself as being disguised as Ezekiel the entire time. Spider-man then gets ambushed and killed by the Kravinoff's. With Kraven finally back from the dead, he shows his anger at Sasha by confirming that the blood was not that of the real Spider-Man but of his clone Kaine. When Peter awakens, he finds Kaine's body in a coffin with a note reading \"Hunt me\" and his black costume lying beside the coffin. Spider-Man begins to hunt the Kravinoff's one by one, first taking out Chameleon and nearly killing Vladimir with a giant tombstone before dodging a point-blank shot from Alyosha's rifle. Spider-man than appears on the roof of the mansion and attacks Sasha, leaving the mark of Kaine on her face (using his finger's abilities to rip the skin off of her face) in revenge for the death of his clone and \"brother\". Spider-Man and Kraven then proceed to engage into battle and the fight proves to be completely one-sided as Peter goes all out with the intentions of killing Kraven for the murders of his friends. As he is about to deliver the killing blow to Kraven with his own spear, Arachne (As the new Madame Web) appears and shows Spider-man a grim future that would follow if he decided to murder Kraven. Spider-Man lets Kraven live and tells him that it's his second and last chance to live.\n\nThey were still defeated by Spider-Man, Arachne, and Arana. Peter reconciles with Mary Jane in OMIT and protects Norman Osborn's newborn baby from Doctor Octopus during a story called Origin of the Species. The baby is revealed to be Harry's.\n\nBig Time\n\nThe Big Time story arc mainly deals with Peter's luck getting better after going through much turmoil. As Spider-Man, Peter has become a much more respected member of the Super-Hero community. Additionally, thanks to Marla Jameson, Peter has become a think tank scientist at Horizon Labs under the employ of known scientist Max Modell. Roderick Kingsley is murdered by a crazed Phil Urich who takes up the mantle of the Hobgoblin. He takes on the mission Kingpin initially assigned to Kingsley, which involved stealing a metal called reverbium from Horizon Labs. On Peter's first day at Horizon Labs, the lab is attacked by the new Hobgoblin who is using new weapons. After a fight with Spider-Man, Phil steals the reverbium and delivers it to Kingpin who allows Phil to work for him. Spider-Man designs himself a new Stealth Suit (Which has the ability to turn invisible.) to overcome Phil's Goblin Laugh which incapacitated him in their previous encounter. Along with the Black Cat, he attempts to take down Kingpin and Hobgoblin and steal back the reverbium. At Fisk Towers, Spider-Man and the Black Cat fight the Hobgoblin, Kingpin, and his Hand Ninjas. The reverbium is destroyed along with Fisk Towers, and Hobgoblin and Kingpin escape. But despite everything, Peter is now living a life with his dignity intact. He now has a new girlfriend, a new apartment, and a proud Aunt May and Jay Sr. Part 2 Alistair Smythe and his Spider-Slayers are back and taking aim at Mayor J. Jonah Jameson and his astronaut son John once again. Smythe returns Mac Gargan to his Scorpion identity and attacks the launch site where John is flying the Vertex shuttle into orbit which will meet up with a Horizon Labs space station. Spider-Man appears and web lines to a shuttle that just took off. Smythe has locked down the controls and rigged its booster rockets to explode before it leaves the atmosphere.\n\nTo make matters worse, the evolved Scorpion appears to kill Spider-Man. But with secret help from Otto Octavius Spider-Man saves John. He gets help from the New Avengers in defending Jonah but Smythe sends his Insect Army after Jonah's loved ones. But Spidey and his friends cannot hurt the Insect Army, they can barely even touch them, as Smythe gave them their own spider-sense. Peter with the help of Max Modell creates the spider-sense disruptor. He is given the detonator and must be far from the center of the \"explosion\" or his sense might be also caught in. But during the second fight against the Scorpion, Scorpion destroys the detonator, and Spider-Man must do it manually. And when he detonates it he is caught in the epicenter. The Insect Army has lost the spider-sense, but so has Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion, he goes to check on the others but Smythe suddenly appears and Spider-Man had not seen it coming due to not having spider-sense, but Marla Jameson did. She jumps right in front of Jonah, and saves him but scarifies her own life in the process. Spider-Man then defeats Smythe and for the first time, Jonah refuses to blame Spider-Man and blames himself instead.\n\nFollowing Marla's funeral, Peter has a horrible nightmare that causes him to question his methods of dealing with criminals. People around him are dying because criminals keep on coming back. After waking up, a shaken Spider-Man decides that things will not remain as they are and vows that, whenever he is around and wherever he is, no one dies.\n\nSpider-Island\n\nPeter is shown to be learning the 'Way of the Spider', from Shang-Chi, and also seen neutralizing a couple of robberies. Jackal is revealed to be working on a scheme, recruiting several spider-powered criminals for some kind of project. Later, Peter and Carlie Cooper are talking when Carlie reveals she has spider-powers. When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr. Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading. While at a lab, Peter and Carlie are attacked by Chance, Scorcher, and White Rabbit, who also have spider powers. Peter manages to defeat them using his training from Shang-Chi. Jackal has the battle taped and gives it to Tarantula to study, as he will soon be 'tested'. Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider powers but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however, Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the 'web of life'. Carlie meets up with Spider-Man when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms. After taking off his mask, they find that his face is slowly mutating into a spider's face, and his body is doing the same. Carlie starts to mutate as well. The Spider-Queen tells Jackal that the people of New York will soon become spiders, and she will own New York.\n\nReed and Horizon finally develop a cure to the virus, based on Anti-Venom's symbiotic abilities, able to kill the virus and reverse the mutation, turning the spiders into normal people again. However, the Spider-Queen sends Tarantula to poison the serum; Peter fights him off, and Reed and Horizon manage to give Peter back his spider-sense. Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen's mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.\n\nSpider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship with Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen's sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several Autobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen's mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen's bone marrow for future experiments.\n\nThe following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people. Carlie deduces who Peter is and promptly breaks up with him for lying to her. Mary Jane admits her love for Peter, and Peter administers an antidote to her. The two look up at the Empire State Building, which is projecting a red and blue light, thanking Spider-Man for his heroic deeds.\n\nEnds of the Earth\n\nDoc Ock knows that he is soon going to die. Before his death, he wants to be remembered as the man who saved the world by stopping the Greenhouse effect. Spider-man doesn't believe Octavius, however, so he gathers the Avengers in order to discover Ock's true plan and put a stop to it. Unknown to Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was well prepared for the fight and the Sinister Six subdue the Avengers. Doc Ock is about to kill Spider-Man, but Silver Sable comes to the rescue. She saves Peter and the Black Widow, and they set off to Octavius' manufacturing plants. There they encounter the Sandman, but they manage to beat him. Doc Ock asked the nations to capture Spider-Man (his position enabled him to do so) and he also called on many villains to take down Spider-Man. Parker knows that he can't stop Otto alone, so he asks other heroes to destroys Ock's facilities. When Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable reach the main base in Romania, Doctor Octopus activates his satellites, and every area that faces the sun explodes. It later turns out that this was only an illusion created by Mysterio, rather than reality. Spider-Man captures Mysterio and finds out that Doc Ock is hiding in Guatemala, but after Pete, Silver, and Natasha arrive at the site they're attacked by a group of mind-controlled Avengers. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable gain an edge because the mind-controlled Avengers are unable to fight as well as they would normally, and the Avengers are able to return to their senses thanks to Mysterio's technology.\n\nBlack Widow was knocked out during the fight, however. Doctor Octopus launched several missiles so the Red Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor try to put an end to it. Mysterio reveals that Octavius' base is underwater, so Spider-Man and Sable resolve to put an end to Otto's plot once and for all. They, unfortunately, meet Rhino on their way, and he catches Sable and begins choking her in the water. With her final breath, Silver tells Peter to leave her and stop Otto. Spider-man is desperate to help her, but he knows that he's running out of time and is left with no choice. Spider-Man finally finds and battles Octavius, but he is eventually caught in the Doc's metal tentacles. With Parker trapped, Octavius reveals that his plan is to scar the earth, to be worse than Hitler and the other monsters, and in that way be remembered. Octopus removes his armor in order to activate his master plan, but Spider-Man tells Doc Ock that he had made an error in allowing himself to be distracted just long enough for Peter to break free. Spider-Man saves both Doctor Octopus and the world, but at the cost of Silver Sable's life.\n\nNo Turning Back\n\nIt's been three weeks since spider-man foiled Doc Ock's plan and now Peter is invited to MJ's, which is Mary Jane's Club, but he is still under the weather because he was not able to prevent Silver Sable's death, but while Peter is \"having fun\" at the party Carlie calls and tells Spider-man to come to meet her at the cemetery. Spider-Man arrives and Carlie tells him that the groundskeeper saw a pale man digging the grave of Billie Connors with his bare hands and then vanishing into the dark with the body. Spider-Man instantly realized that this pale powerful man was Morbius and he goes to face him at Horizon labs. Spider-Man, disgusted by Morbius' actions, starts to attack him but eventually stops when Michael explains that the reason he dug up the grave was to find a cure for the Lizard, and he tells Peter that he has already accomplished his goal. Spider-Man, hearing this, plans an attack on the Lizard and confronts him in the sewers and fights him for a long period of time, but finally, Morbius and Spider-Man stab the Lizard with enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to bring Connor's back. But the Lizard is still in control, even in Kurt's body.\n\nThe Lizard awakens Morbius' violent vampire side, with the smell of blood. And while Spider-Man was distracted by Morbius, Connors created the new serum that will turn him into the Lizard again, but this serum turns everyone into lizards except Connors himself, so while testing this serum Connors turns the entire Horizon Labs crew into Lizards. When he finally created the serum for himself, it turned him into a new version of the Lizard. When Spider-Man comes after capturing Morbius, Carlie tells him what has happened. Spidey creates a new cure and a battle ensures between Spider-Man and the Lizard. When Spider-Man stabs the Lizard with a harpoon filled with the cure, nothing happens, the cure doesn't work. Only at the end, we see that the cure has actually worked, and now Connors' mind is secretly in control of the Lizard's body.\n\nAlpha\n\nA teen outcast Andy Maguire went on a trip from his school to Horizon Labs, where Peter Parker was holding an experiment. Tiberius Stone, not liking Peter, sabotages the experiment, and Andy is hit with a ray of Peter Particles. Soon after he discovers he has super-powers. When he is examined by top greatest superhuman specialists, Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Henry Pym, and Hank McCoy, they discover that he has energy projection, flight, super speed, super strength, and force field, but his limitation is he can control only one power at a time. Reed tells Peter that he had discovered these particles, but didn't publish his work, because he considered the particles too powerful and dangerous.\n\nHe then assigns Alpha as Spider-Man's sidekick. Alpha is however very careless and eventually quits working with Spider-Man and goes solo. Spider-Man decides then that there should be Alpha no more! Soon when the earth is under attack from Terminus, Alpha is called by Captain America to fight him. During the fight, Alpha behaves most irresponsible and almost destroys planes flying in the air. Though Alpha defeats Terminus, Peter observes that Terminus' staff can redirect Alpha energy. Then Spider-Man calls Alpha for another \"analysis\" and uses the tech acquired from the Terminus to strip Andy of his Alpha power, leaving him as nobody again.\n\nDying Wish\n\nUsing a modified Octo-bot, Octavius successfully transfers his consciousnesses into Spider-Man, leaving him with Peter's memories and body and Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus's dying one. After leaving Peter for dead Otto begins to take on Spider-Man's life as his own. Peter eventually took control of the golden Octo-bot and using one of Doc Ock's own contingency plans had Scorpion, Hydro-Man and Trapster free himself from the S.H.I.E.L.D. prison The Raft. It was then that Peter tried to redo the body switch with Ock who had taken precautions to keep that from happening. Peter instead had Otto relive all of Peter's memories showing Dr. Octopus how much he had wasted his life. As a result of Peter's personality grafted to his own, Dr. Octopus decided to continue on as Spider-Man and make up for his past mistakes as the Superior Spider-man.\n\nSuperior Spider-Man\n\nHowever, Parker still existed within Doctor Octopus's mind in the memories that he absorbed. The consciousness intent on stopping the villain and reclaiming his life tries to influence Octavius but fails to do so in any more than the slightest of ways. Parker's remnant also inadvertently causes Otto to share Peter's genuine love for Mary Jane Watson, and so pushes her away for her own safety. After Otto used a brain scanner to treat a young girl's brain injury, he decided to use the device on himself to discover Parker's presence within his mind. A mental battle ensues between himself and Parker, which Otto seemingly wins, erasing Peter's memories.\n\nAfter Octavius tries to retrieve some of Parker's memories in an attempt to solve a reverbium related problem, Peter's consciousness begins to re-emerge, having somehow escaped the mind-purge. When Otto is possessed by the Venom Symbiote and is unable to free himself of it, Peter's consciousness again emerges and breaks the Symbiote's hold over Dr. Octopus, enabling Flash Thompson to call it back to him.\n\nPeter Parker's re-emerged consciousness begins to explore his Mindscape, discovering the world is now a large empty space, with only the very few key memories left. Recalling that he's more than Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man, he declares that Otto had made a big mistake in leaving the memories that define him and promises to find a way to regain control of his body. Continuing to explore the Mindscape for clues into reclaiming his body from Doctor Octopus, he makes a note that only 31 pieces of his memories are left and wonders what he can do with them. Just then, he stumbles upon the memory of his fight with the Green Goblin at the Brooklyn Bridge, wonders why Doctor Octopus is probing into this. Deciding to delve into Doctor Octopus's memories for a way out, he is overwhelmed by the number of memories and struggles to hold on. He sees a bright light and witnesses the moment of Otto Octavius's birth. Peter Parker's consciousness struggles to fight against the deluge of Doctor Octopus' memories, but it proves too much and he convinces himself that he is Doctor Octopus merging with Otto's memories.\n\nSpider-Verse\n\nWhile adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company, Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon, a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had, in fact, survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.\n\nNot long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk, Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099 A.D., the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.\n\nThe combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to Earth-3145 after their safe zone in Earth-13 had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother Jennix, and his father and leader of the Inheritors, Solus. With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine Parker, Cindy Moon, and Benjy Parker of Earth-982, respectively.\n\nWith the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as \"Spider-Gwen,\" launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145.\n\nWith the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing the memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.\n\nRise and Fall of Parker Industries\n\nUnbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the Living Brain. Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries.\n\nAs a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. This change in Peter's life impacted his superheroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.\n\nOne of Peter's biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid, called New U. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries' resources to help his plan, the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy. In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place.\n\nThe Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide. The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webware transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration but not before most of the clones died. The Jackal, is a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.\n\nAfterward, Peter teamed-up again with Teresa Durand, a CIA agent with whom Peter had already joined forces in a mission at least a year ago during which she was seemingly brainwashed by the Kingpin and Mentallo to believe she was Peter's long-lost sister. Teresa sought Peter's help when on the run from a government organization called the Gray Blade.\n\nHydra's take-over of the United States of America temporarily put a halt to Peter and Teresa's escapades. Numerous headquarters of Parker Industries around the globe were then targeted by the forces of the terrorist organization, namely a unit led by one of Hydra's latest additions, the duplicate of Doctor Octopus, who had gained a physical body through the Jackal's cloning technology.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to prevent the resources of Parker Industries from falling in the hands of Octavius and Hydra, Parker had his employees obliterate all systems of the company, running Parker Industries into the ground. He later fought alongside the rest of America's superheroes that assembled in Washington, D.C. to retake the United States from Hydra's control.\n\nDespite having his civilian reputation smeared due to his company's collapse, Peter quickly got back on his feet. After beginning a short-lived relationship with Parker Industries' former S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison Mockingbird, Peter was hired by Robbie Robertson as the editor for the Daily Bugle's science section.\n\nBefore Peter recovered himself, however, his adventure with Teresa continued, who discovered that she truly was Mary and Richard Parker's daughter, and shared this information with Peter.\n\nNot long after Peter had decided to reveal his secret identity to Jameson, Jonah was kidnapped by Norman Osborn, and accidentally let it slip that Peter was Spider-Man. In addition to having regained his powers, Osborn had bonded with the Carnage Symbiote, giving birth to the Red Goblin.\n\nPeter failed to take down Osborn despite the help from his allies, and was overpowered in battle even after Eddie Brock had lent him his symbiote. Peter only managed to defeat Osborn in a fight after tricking him into rejecting the symbiote, having claimed that any credit for his defeat would go to the Carnage symbiote and not Osborn himself. Unfortunately, the process of defeating Osborn cost the life of Spider-Man's biggest fan, Flash Thompson, who had recently become the superhero Agent Anti-Venom.\n\nKindred Rising\n\nFollowing Osborn's defeat, Peter's life was presented with several tribulations. After becoming Mayor of NYC, Kingpin became publicly accepting of Spider-Man while condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate the Web-Slinger from his super hero peers. In his civilian identity, Peter was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius. Unable to defend himself without exposing his secret identity, Peter had his credentials revoked, causing him to be fired from the Daily Bugle.\n\nOn the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane, and was given an opportunity to re-apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr. Curt Connors, leading Peter to re-enroll at the Empire State University to earn his college degree himself. Peter also moved into a shared apartment with Randy Robertson and Frederick Myers, the alter-ego of the super villain Boomerang, with whom Peter eventually developed a friendship both as Parker and Spider-Man.\n\nDuring this time, Peter became the target of fixation of a mysterious supernatural entity that dubbed himself \"Kindred\" to hide his true identity, that of Harry Osborn, somehow turned into a demonic creature consumed by the belief that Peter had to repent for his sins and the misery he brought on his loved ones.\n\nAs Kindred, Harry pulled the strings of Peter's life to ensure no harm befell him until they could meet directly, while also forcing him and Mary Jane apart by employing Mysterio to have her career make her move to the West coast to film for some months. Kindred only presented himself to Peter in nebulous nightmares to further his psychological torment, leaving him with the uneasy sensation that somebody was lurking.\n\nDue to Octavius' reckless experimentations with the Inheritor's technology, the totem-hunting family broke free from their prison, with Morlun personally going after Peter. Spider-Man was successful in defeating Morlun with the help of J. Jonah Jameson and the NYPD, and managed to join the reassembled Spider-Army in the final confrontation against the Inheritors that saw the defeat of the hunter family.\n\nPeter's next big challenge presented itself when Kraven the Hunter hurtled him into a hunting contest alongside various animal-themed villains held in Central Park. Accompanied by a younger clone of himself he deemed his \"son,\" Kraven's ultimate goal was to goad Spider-Man into killing him, since only dying by the Web-Slinger's had would break his undead curse. During their final confrontation, Spider-Man convinced Kraven that true strength of character was best shown through compassion and mercy. Kraven called off the hunt and donned Spider-Man's costume to die in battle against his son. Since embracing Peter's ideals turned him into Spider-Man in spirit and because his death was deliberate, therefore by his own hand, the curse allowed Kraven to remain dead.\n\nShortly afterward, Peter became tangled in a conflict between Venom and the resurgent Carnage, who had become the herald of the Symbiote God Knull and embarked in a journey to retrieve symbiote remnants of people, dead or alive, who had been bound to a symbiote, in order to awaken Knull from his slumber. Spider-Man helped Venom's efforts to stop Kasady, most notably protecting Brock's son Dylan and Normie Osborn from Norman Osborn, who still believed himself to be Cletus Kasady and had been bonded to a copy of the Carnage symbiote by the real Kasady and turned into a pawn. Dark Carnage's reign of terror was stopped by Venom when he murdered Kasady to save Dylan's life, albeit causing himself to absorb Kasady's composite symbiote, awakening Knull.\n\nKindred would finally interact directly with Peter, setting the stage by resurrecting Stanley Carter, the Sin-Eater, and sending him on a campaign of vicious vigilantism, using new abilities to strip both the powers and wickedness off super villains, leaving them with a deep repentance. Under Kindred's orders, Sin-Eater targeted the restored Norman Osborn, the new director of the Ravencroft Institute. Initially conflicted, Peter chose to save Osborn, who became the Green Goblin again to fight in his escaping Sin-Eater. With help from his spider hero friends in The Order, Peter brought Osborn to an escape pod but Osborn's antagonism caused Peter to reconsider and abandoned Norman Osborn to Sin-Eater's mercy.\n\nWith Sin-Eater purifying Osborn, Kindred had the collected sins absorbed go out to possess and corrupt the Order. Managing to evade his possessed allies, Spider-Man sought Doctor Strange's help, later using a mystic artifact to locate Kindred's home at the Osborn family cemetery. Kindred staged the corpses of lost loved ones in a macabre scene, expressing his intentions to Peter, and eventually revealing himself as Harry. Kindred continuously killed and resurrected Peter as a direct torture, then forcing him to sit at a dinner alongside Mary Jane to repent for his perceived sins, including what Peter didn't remember that allegedly turned Harry into Kindred. The event was interrupted by Norman, who allied himself with Kingpin to capture Harry in a Darkforce cage.\n\nWhile Spider-Man was liberated from Kindred's clutches, Peter was shaken to his core and knew that his and Mary Jane's ordeal with Kindred wasn't truly done. While drained emotionally, Mary Jane would give him an improvised therapy session to alleviate some hurt, regaining some hope in himself.\n\nAfter Peter accepted Norah's TNM job offer, granting Spider-Man a new suit enhancing his physical attributes, Spider-Man and Boomerang continued collecting Tablet fragments and moved to secure the final piece. Rescuing an abducted Randy and Janice, Spider-Man aided Robbie and Tombstone with The Syndicate in taking down Madame Masque and Crime Master. With help from his New Avengers colleagues and Black Cat delivering Fisk's fragments, Spider-Man passed the final fragment's curse test, but Fred betrayed him with help from his cohorts. Felicia returned Peter to his ruined apartment to rest, later reading Fred's note explaining his long con before the others informed him that Fisk instead revived his son, The Rose. Quitting TNM and donating his pay to Aunt May's FEAST shelter, Peter met with Betty returned home from Europe, surprised by her advanced pregnancy.\n\nSinister War\n\nKindred had masterminded a number of upgrades and alliances among Spider-Man’s rogue gallery for a massive supervillain war:\n\nDoc Ock was returned to his original body and given means to recreate the Sinister Six including a clone of Kraven, a version of Lizard free of Connors humanity, and a resurrected Electro\n\nA version of the Savage Six that was chasing the Sinister Six for revenge on one of its members, Mysterio\n\nA new Lethal Legion led by a resurrected Sin-Eater\n\nA new Wild Pack, financed by Foreigner after his off-the-grid casino was sabotaged\n\nA new Sinister Syndicate run by Beetle desperate to make a name for themselves.\n\nAnd a return of the Superior Foes, led by Boomerang, hot off a major win.\n\nThey regroup with other supervillain teams at a graveyard where Spider-Man was hiding. Kindred let them know they were all hellbound and gave them all the same offer, the villain that kills Spider-Man will get a free pass in Hell. Thankfully, not all of them fell for Kindred’s offer. Boomerang, who had come to like Spider-Man, sacrificed himself to save Spidey from Morlun. This inspired any of the villains who had any doubts whatsoever about their path. Eventually, Doc Ock uses a piece of Black Ant's helmet to knock everyone out through the ear centipedes Kindred was using to manipulate them.\n\nWith no other villains to deal with, Spider-Man was able to track down Kindred, which was revealed to be Gabriel and Sarah Stacy. They were clones created by an A.I. copy of Harry Osborn from before Spidey’s deal with Mephisto. They were made from Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn’s DNA, and the affair between Norman and Gwen was made up by the Harry A.I. The human Harry was also a clone. He came to Spider-Man’s defense, but the A.I. had him killed. The clones had actually been serving Mephisto, who was trying to keep Peter and Mary Jane apart per their deal. After the clones failed, Mephisto had them destroyed.\n\nBeyond\n\nSpidey was backed into a corner legally when the Beyond Corporation bought the Spider-Man trademark, which Doc Ock had filed, during the Parker Industries liquidation. They used that trademark to make their own branded Spider-Man with the help of Ben Reilly. Although Peter and Ben were on good terms, Peter didn’t like Beyond being in the Spider-Man business. However, his hand was forced when he was attacked by the U-Foes and hospitalized for a unique form of radiation poisoning. Peter chose to trust Ben while he focused on getting healthy.\n\nThanks to Doc Ock still feeling heroic after his run-in with Kindred, Otto worked with Aunt May to investigate the U-Foes and determine the proper care required for the radiation, which had eluded the hospital staff at this point. Once he started to show signs of improvement, Peter had superhuman physical therapy with Black Cat and Captain America. In true Spidey fashion, he was forced back into the field before he was 100% when Ben started acting erratically.\n\nUnfortunately, Beyond was conducting memory experiments on Ben. Without the childhood memories of Uncle Ben that he shared with Peter, Ben seemed to lose all sense of a moral compass. He violently demanded Beyond give him back those memories. He went as far as to attack Peter with a piece of Beyond machinery that would steal Pete's childhood memories for Ben. Peter was forced to fight him, causing Ben to fall into the psychotropic fluid that Beyond used to scrub their existence from this universe.\n\nMarked\n\nWhen Peter and MJ planned on moving in with each other, rekindling their romance, their plans were interrupted by Benjamin Rabin. Rabin had returned to try yet again to sacrifice Spidey and MJ to summon his god, Wayep. Once marked, Spidey and MJ found themselves on an alternate Earth already destroyed by Wayep. There, they befriended a survivor named Paul.\n\nSpidey attempted to rig his dimensional Spider-Society watch to save them. When Wayep attacked, MJ activated the device sending Spidey home, killing Wayep, but trapping her with Paul. Desperate, Spidey started acting erratically trying to find a way back to MJ. After burning bridges with some of his super friends, Spidey accepted help from Norman Osborn, freshly sinless after his run-in with Sin-Eater right before the Sinister War.\n\nWhen Spidey made it back to that devastated Earth, time dilation had allowed four years to pass. MJ had started a romantic relationship with Paul and adopted two children, also survivors on that Earth. Spidey rescued them back to MJ’s original Earth, but MJ decided to stay with Paul and the children, breaking Peter’s heart.\n\nSix months later, Rabin would resurface and target MJ once again. The two children in her care were creations of Rabin that he used to track her. She still carried the mark for Rabin's ritual. Spidey, with the help of The Fantastic Four, Ms. Marvel, and Norman (now active as the Gold Goblin) did their best to protect her. Ms. Marvel went as far as to shapeshift to look like MJ, distracting Rabin. Rabin managed to kill her, but since it wasn't the real MJ, the summoning spell was ruined. Wayep's spirit killed Rabin for his failure, and Kamala died in Spidey's arms\n\nDark Web\n\nBen Reilly eventually re-entered Peter’s life with a psychedelic upgrade to his spider-sense, thanks to Beyond’s experiments. He started working with fellow “evil” clone Madelyne Pryor. The two conspired to help each other steal the memories from their genetic originals. They would do so with an enchanted fruit that would steal the memories if eaten. Their first step was flooding the streets with demonic possessions to get Spidey’s attention. Once they had it, they baited Spidey into entering Limbo to save his friends, Robbie Robertson and JJ Jameson.\n\nLimbo was turned into Pete’s own personal hell: the Daily Bugle office run by demons where Pete, JJ, and Robbie are forced to pretend like everything is normal. Ben keeps offering to end it if he just takes a bite of the fruit. To keep Pete busy as Spider-Man, they turned six demons into Sinister Six analogues: The Insidious Six. They didn’t count on Spidey getting help from a demon that Spidey had earlier saved from a bully. Inspired, that demon bonded with a symbiote and turned into Rek-Rap.\n\nLuckily, Ben and Madelyne began to part ways. Ben turned on Madelyne, taking her throne and moving her demon world to Earth. With them distracted, Spidey and Rek-Rap were able to fight their way out of Limbo and join the X-Men, who had made an ally out of Madelyne. Together, Madelyne took her throne back and committed to turning over a new leaf, even creating an embassy in the city while locking Ben up.\n\nEnd of the Spider-Verse\n\nSpider-allies came to Spidey’s defense when he was approached by Morlun, however, Morlun was looking for help. His family was massacred by Shathra and her Sisterhood of the Wasp, old rivals of the Spider Society. At the same time, Spidey and his friends are attacked by members of the Spider Society having been transformed into wasps, one of which managed to stab Spider-Woman with a ritual dagger, severing her from the Great Web of Destiny. Anya whisked them all away, including Morlun, to Earth 616-Beta, a version of Earth 616 that was disconnected from the Great Web. Peter’s first goal was to rescue Spider-Woman. They investigated a Spider Society temple only to be attacked by Gwen Stacy, having been turned by the wasps. She was able to stab Spidey with the ritual dagger, severing him from the Great Web.\n\nA new version of Peter Parker was made thanks to the severing. He was never bit by the spider nor became a hero, but when his aunt and uncle were threatened by a thief, he did step up to defend them, getting shot in the leg in the process. His life changed after that. He had the respect of Flash and the other cool kids at school and became the gadget guy for Silk, who was still bit by the spider. After school, he got a job at OsCorp where he accidentally discovered the existence of the Great Web.\n\nHis experiments with the Great Web got the attention of both the Spider Society and the Sisterhood of the Wasps. He was stuck between both groups, but he eventually used a device he created to cleanse the Great Web, erasing Shathra and bringing back the original creator of the web, Neith. Neith had the corresponding talisman that could bring back the original Spidey and other spider-heroes who had been stabbed by the dagger.\n\nGang War\n\nAfter Hammerhead incites a gang war, Spider-Man is tasked by Mayor Luke Cage to put together a team to help suppress it. The team includes Miles Morales, Spider-Woman, She-Hulk, and Elektra. After shutting down a fight between Crime Master and Ringmaster, the team realized the fight was too big and they needed to split up. She-Hulk would ultimately stay partnered with Spider-Man.\n\nThey were eventually approached by Tombstone, who had been hospitalized at the beginning of the war. He was concerned for his daughter, Beetle, who had gotten invested in the war while running her father's organization while he healed. Knowing Tombstone had been trying to go legit, Spider-Man agreed to help. After receiving intel from Kingpin, they realized they needed to reunite the team to stop a duel in Central Park between two of the few gangs still standing: Madame Masque's Maggia and Beetle's Syndicate.\n\nSpider-Man reunited the team in Central Park to stop a showdown. Their fellow ally, Tombstone, saw an opportunity to usurp his own daughter as the head of the territories north of Central Park. He ordered his new gangs to retreat. With just Masque's gang to contend with, Spidey and the other heroes were able to overwhelm them.\n\nIn the aftermath, the vigilante law is repealed, and Tombstone became the new Kingpin of New York.\n\nSpider-Goblin\n\nHaving warmed up to Norman Osborn’s new heroism. Peter had taken a job at OsCorp that allowed him time off to be Spider-Man anytime he needed. Unfortunately, Osborn’s heroism was tested. A jealous Doc Ock injected him with the goblin formula, but he fought it off. Then a vengeful Queen Goblin summoned Osborn’s sins into a spear and manipulated Kraven into stabbing him with it. Spider-Man shielded Osborn, absorbing the sins and turning evil. This unhinged version of Spider-Man terrified Kraven, who teamed up with Osborn to move the sins back into the spear.\n\nUnfortunately, the damage was done. Osborn was finally under the Goblin’s control again. Before Peter was cured, he had Peter’s possessed mind copied by the Winkler Device. Later, he used it to replant this “Spider-Goblin” back into Peter’s body to be used as a weapon against the Sinister Six. They had reunited to target the Living Brain for targeting them in an earlier scheme, but Osborn needed the Brain for his own purposes. While attacking the Sinister Six, he was interrupted by Ben Reilly. He had visions of Spider-Goblin after being exposed to the Winkler Device and wanted to help Peter. After exposing him to his psychoreactive goo, Peter's mind was temporarily stabilized.\n\nWhile he was clearheaded, Peter rigged parts of the Winkler Device to the magic spear so that he could use it to clear both Osborn's mind and soul. This was seemingly part of Osborn's plan. He stabbed himself with the spear allowing his sins to jump from his body to Peter's. Norman was clear-headed again but the Living Brain, had a better plan. It requested Norman rig it to the Winkler Device and put it on Peter's head. This trapped both the Goblin sins and mind in Peter to be drowned by Peter's inherent goodness, freeing Norman of them once again.\n\nVenom War\n\nOn his night off, Peter was watching wrestling when he saw Eddie Brock and the other Kings in Black from the timestream teleport into the ring and start making a violent spectacle. Not understanding what Eddie was up to, Peter started to gear up when he found the Venom symbiote in his closet. Feeling ashamed that he failed both Eddie and Dylan Brock, it had sulked its way to the only person it thought would be kind enough to accept it. After filling Peter in on what has been going on, Peter gives the symbiote a much needed pep talk before accepting it as a temporary host to confront Eddie together.\n\nPersonality\n\nWhether a law is right or wrong, moral or immoral, is an idea, a personal philosophy... but it always seems that fights over ideas skip over the barrier into the real world and become battles of real violence.\n\n--Spider-Man (Peter Parker)\n\nSpider-Man is commonly seen as a brave and righteous hero with an indomitable sense of justice and responsibility. Shaken by his uncle's tragic death, Spider-Man's vow of responsibility has led him to a path of heroism and humanitarian service. There are times when Spider-Man's sense of responsibility can be almost overbearing; this was evidently noted by Luke Cage when he felt embarrassed about Electro causing the Raft breakout, despite the fact he had nothing to do with it. This combined with his strong moral compass in the face of adversity and sharp wit makes him one of the most iconic and enduring heroes in the Marvel Universe.\n\nOne of Spider-Man's most prominent traits is his sense of humor. He at times is seen as the class clown in every group he is in. Even in the face of certain death, Spider-Man invariably cracks a joke, to the annoyance of both friends and foes. His reasons for this vary: either he wants to relieve the stress of a situation, or simply because he wants to hide how scared he really is during a crisis. Also, he does this to get on the nerves of his opponents, since he knows that if they are angry, that they would normally lose themselves and be vulnerable to a superior skilled opponent. It is generally agreed, however, that whenever a life is in danger, he will stop telling jokes and take the current situation with the utmost seriousness.\n\nBehind this humorous facade, however, is a wounded soul that has gone through much suffering. While Spider-Man is in combat, occasionally another person dies, leaving him depressed for having failed in his responsibility. Guilt over the loss of his Uncle Ben continues to be the primary motivating factor in his super-heroics and his life in general. Peter is quick to assume guilt and responsibility for anything bad that happens in his presence or that can, in some way, relate back to him. For instance, he assumed responsibility for Electro's mass breakout at the Raft and Norman Osborn's Initiative because they were \"his\" villains.\n\nDeath, in particular, is difficult for Peter to reconcile with, leading him to make dramatic and unrealistic proclamations, such as his \"Nobody dies!\" credo after Marla Madison's passing. Peter has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly related to Norman Osborn's murder of Gwen Stacy and Flash Thompson, which was exacerbated by Kindred repeatedly killing and resurrecting him. Peter also deeply hates symbiotes and blames himself for everyone who has died at the hands of Venom, Carnage, and other symbiotes due to having brought the Venom symbiote to Earth.\n\nSpider-Man is also traditionally a loner. Due to his individualistic style, having been a social outcast in his youth, Spider-Man finds it hard to work in teams. However, this has gradually lessened over the years, to the point Spider-Man has worked actively with the Avengers.\n\nPeter is also a strong-willed hero, whatever obstacles that come his way, if it's relationships, being misunderstood, or someone dying in his watch, he always gets back up. His indomitable will and don't give up attitude usually pushed him to do amazing feats like supporting the weight of a jet[344] and beating up Firelord. Despite being a hero, Spider-Man is nerdy, awkward, and shy. These traits have faded through the years as Parker grew up and gained confidence, but elements of the awkward teenage nerd still remain in his personality.\n\nSpider-Man's righteousness complimented Daredevil's maturity as a crime-fighter during the The Death of Jean DeWolff, leading to an enduring friendship. Peter also made close ties with the Fantastic Four at the very start of his career, which stands greater than ever today, like a family rendering aid to each other unconditionally.Spider-Man has bonded with the New Avengers of whom he is a founding member, trusting them so much that he would reveal his identity to them. Of the two previously mentioned teams, Spidey is closest to the Human Torch, playing pranks on one another or seeking solace respectively, and Wolverine, respectively. Peter is also quite close to the X-Men, able to sympathize with the public scorn that mutants often face,[351] and once joining their faculty - though he was quick to call them out on being prejudicial against non-mutants. Spider-Man has also developed a strong friendship with Deadpool, despite annoying each other with their morals and jokes.\n\nPersonal Data\n\nCharacteristics\n\nHeight: 5'10\"\n\nWeight: 167 lbs. 11.93 stones 75.75kg\n\nEye Color: Hazel\n\nHair Color: Brown\n\nIdentity: Secret\n\nPlace of Birth: Forest Hills, New York\n\nCitizenship: U.S.A.\n\nEducation: College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)\n\nOccupation: Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher, Horizon Labs employee\n\nKnown Relatives: Richard Parker (father, deceased), Mary Parker (mother, deceased), Benjamin Parker (uncle, deceased), May Parker (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), Amy Reilly (cousin), Amanda Reilly (cousin), Alexa Reilly (cousin), Benjamin Reilly (Scarlet Spider, clone), Kaine (clone), Spidercide (clone).\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nSpider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea Tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.\n\nThe radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.\n\nSpider-Sense\n\nSpider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone-based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate Michele Gonzales with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When Daken used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course, his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with Iron Fist. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired, or when he chooses to ignore it although it's difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There were also times that his spider-sense wasn't very effective due to Spidey's previous lack of formal training, but this has since has been largely rectified since learning the Way of the Spider. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense. Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man's first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spiders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe's minions' enhanced senses but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.\n\nSuperhuman Strength\n\nSpider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a height of much greater than three stories with one powerful jump. Spidey's strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with opponents including Doctor Octopus, Venom, and Rhino. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the Hulk. It's also shown that Spider-Man can break free from Doctor Octopus's nearly indestructible arms albeit with much effort, although this was due to the Sinister Six suit enhancing his strength. Spidey's strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of humans as his body produces fewer fatigue toxins. He was able to fight Morlun continually for many hours and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man's strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons without effort and after the Other story arc he was able to lift at least 20 tons without effort. During that time, he wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift over 25 tons without effort. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline. Spider-man's best strength feats tend to come during periods of emotional duress- for example in a fight with Iron Man 2020, where when a boy was injured mid-fight, an enraged Spider-Man jumped up to his flying height and hit him with such force the foe was sent flying hundreds of feet into a building, which was destroyed on impact. Another instance was when he lifted a segment of the Daily Bugle after the building was attacked by the Green Goblin. In both cases, he didn't have any enhancements from the Queen or the Other.\n\nSuperhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility, and Reflexes\n\nSpider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility, and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images. He has been described as moving with the speed of machine-gun fire, moving faster than the eye can follow, and moved so fast that Daredevil (who has enhanced reflexes and senses) could barely register him, and was unable to react to a punch he was knew Spider-Man was going to land. Over longer distances, his speed seems less pronounced, but he was still able to outrun Kraven and his cheetahs (both of whom can run at over 60 mph) and has easily outrun speeding cars. However, this could be due to his preference for Web-Slinging over longer distances than due to an inability to maintain higher levels of speed over longer distances. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance, and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balancing in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even some of the most agile street-level heroes like Captain America, Daredevil, and Wolverine are nowhere near Spider-Man's level of speed and agility. Spider-Man's reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. During the Grim Hunt storyline, he even dodged sniper rifle fire at point-blank range after the bullet had been fired.\n\nSuperhuman Durability\n\nSpider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super-powered individuals. For example, he has frequently taken blows from characters with high levels of superhuman strength (Hulk, Venom, Rhino, Puma, Green Goblin, etc) without sustaining significant injury. He has also survived the force of having a building collapse on him multiple times. This durability extends to falling from great heights. For example, he was once knocked through three buildings by Mr. Negative before falling multiple stories to the ground, yet still remained conscious. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. In the Sins Past Storyline, he tanked a building destroying explosion but was significantly weakened afterward. The toughness of Spider-Man is such that he often rolls with the blows of punches thrown by non-powered foes to avoid injuring them- when he once decided to tense his abdominal muscles against the blows of a trained boxer, the boxer broke his wrists. Scorpion once described Spider-Man's body \"as being as hard as concrete\".\n\nHowever, Spider-Man's durability isn't nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet that pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well. When he lost his Spider-Sense and faced a villain known as Massacre who utilized multiple weaponry and traps, Spider-Man decided to make a bulletproof suit from tech at Horizon labs. However, if injured by such forces, his healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.\n\nWall Crawling\n\nSpider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New York but also has the ability to use it offensively, in a manner resembling the Mark of Kaine. Spider-Man rarely uses this ability though, due to its brutal and disfiguring effects. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.\n\nOrganic Webbing\n\nThere are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long-lasting than his synthetic variants. Spider-Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course) and 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.) Spider-Man also has organic webbing in the 2099 universe. It seems the strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.\n\nSuperhuman Stamina\n\nSpider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He once fought Morlun for many hours continuously and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans.\n\nRegenerative Healing Factor\n\nSpider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however, after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after. In another instance, he suffered multiple broken bones, trauma, and blood loss when he was defeated by the Rhino but was fine in the next issue.\n\nForeign Chemical Resistance\n\nDue to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings but recovered in less than 24 hours. In another example, he was able to recover from the effects of gases nearly instantly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.\n\nSuperhuman Sight\n\nSpider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to ass"
