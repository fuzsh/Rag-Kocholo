        "text": "Spider-Man is in for some rough times ahead as two of his worst enemies join forces.\n\nWarning: this article contains spoilers for Amazing Spider-Man #795!\n\nWriter Dan Slott is gearing up for the final chapter of his long Amazing Spider-Man saga, as Peter Parker again clashes with his worst enemy, Norman Osborn. However, this won't be just any battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Instead, Spidey will be facing off against an Osborn bonded with the Carnage symbiote.\n\nThat unusual pairing of villains was established in this issue. It seems that Osborn, who was rendered sane at the end of Superior Spider-Man in 2014, has been searching for a way to \"restore\" his mind to its sadistic Green Goblin state. Faced with no other options, Osborn willingly bonded with the symbiote in hopes that Cletus Kassidy's psychopathic tendencies might rub off on him. Unfortunately for him, he's already learning that controlling Carnage is no easy task.\n\nWhile that showdown looms in Spider-Man's near future, this issue also dealt with some leftover business from his past. Way back in 2004's Amazing Spider-Man #503, Spider-Man helped Loki rescue his daughter, Tess. In return, Loki offered Spidey a favor of his choosing to be redeemed at a later time. Finally, 14 years later, Spidey finally called in that favor.\n\nThe latest Spidey/Loki team-up came as Peter paid a visit to Doctor Strange's former mansion and accidentally broke open a vial full of supernatural bugs. The two joined forces to destroy the bugs, but in the process an innocent bystander was killed. Spider-Man, ever the selfless hero, demanded that Loki reverse time and save that bystander. Loki happily agreed, as it turns out he orchestrated their entire team-up to ensure that exact outcome. As far as Loki is concerned, a Sorcerer Supreme can't have any unpaid debts, even to someone like Spider-Man.\n\nThis issue also touched on another infamous piece of Spider-Man lore. Spider-Man noted his reluctance about making deals with powerful supernatural beings, in the process hinting that some small part of his mind still remembers the controversial sacrifice to Mephisto he made in 2007's One More Day.\n\nIs it possible that Peter will one day regain his memories of that incident? Let us know what you think in the comments below."
