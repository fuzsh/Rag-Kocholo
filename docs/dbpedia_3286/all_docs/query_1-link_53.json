        "text": "Alternate versions of the Green GoblinFile:Green Goblin and Spider-Man (Earth-20051 versions).jpg\n\nThe parallel universe versions of the Green Goblin and Spider-Man from Earth-20051, Marvel Age Spider-Man #13.\n\nPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceThe Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964)Created byStan Lee\n\nSteve DitkoSee alsoGreen Goblin in other media\n\nAs a fictional character, the Green Goblin has appeared in a number of media, from comic books to films and television series. Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. This article details the various versions of Norman Osborn and other incarnations of the Green Goblin depicted across multiple works published by Marvel Comics.\n\n1602[edit]\n\nIn the Marvel: 1602 Pocket Universe, Norman Osborne appears as a major villain, attempting to find \"the Source\", which is guarded by the Natives of Roanoke Island, and utilize it to gain unimaginable power; to achieve his goal, Osborne allies with King James I of England and makes several attempts to create conflict between his fellow American colonists and the Natives. Ultimately, Osborne is captured and imprisoned in stocks after peace between the colonists and Natives resumes and the English are forced from America.[1]\n\nIn Spider-Man: 1602, Osborne has been released from the stocks, and is now harbourmaster of Roanoke. When Peter Parquagh and Virginia Dare find evidence he is plotting against the natives again, he kills Virginia and exposes Peter's secret identity as The Spider. He is sentenced to be sent back to England, where capital punishment is still practiced. When the Mayflower is attacked by the pirate Wilson Fisk, Osborne's cell is hit by a cannonball. Covered in gangrenous wounds, his sentence is abandoned since he is not expected to live long enough to stand trial in England. He contacts the natural philosopher Henri Le Pym, asking to be cured in return for helping Pym acquire some of Peter's blood for his experiments.[volume & issue needed]\n\nLe Pym's attempts to cure Osborne mutate him into a winged, green-skinned creature, and he uses these powers to capture Parquagh. During his final battle with Parquagh (in which Osborne uses exploding spherical vials as projectiles in combat) he is killed by a crossbow bolt fired by Fisk's first mate, the Bull's Eye, who has also been hunting Parquagh.[2]\n\n2099[edit]\n\nIn the Marvel 2099 setting, the Goblin is a radical trickster who wants to prove that Spider-Man (Miguel O'Hara) is in the pay of a megacorp like Alchemax. He has bat-like glider-wings and a bag of \"tricks\", similar to the 20th century version. He also has the ability to project illusions.[3]\n\nHe is eventually unmasked, and appears to be Spider-Man's brother Gabriel O'Hara, although it is later revealed, in a retcon, that he is a shapeshifter who took Gabriel's identity. Writer Peter David, who quit the book between creating the character and the unmasking, has said that it was his intent for the Goblin to be female Catholic priest named Father Jennifer, and for Gabriel to be a red herring.[4][5] This Goblin was never called the Green Goblin, but instead simply Goblin 2099.[3]\n\nIn All-New, All-Different Marvel, during a travel to 2099, Spider-Man (O'Hara) is captured by that era's Venom and Doctor Octopus. Miguel later wakes up in Alchemax, which is run by that era's Sinister Six. The Sinister Six discover that the Goblin is actually Father Jennifer D'Angelo, an undercover ally of Kasey. After receiving a message from the Sinister Six, Miguel and Kasey go to Alchemax to rescue Father Jennifer. Upon escaping, Spider-Man and Father Jennifer arrive at an area where the time door appears, but Jennifer is killed by Doctor Octopus.\n\nIn other media[edit]\n\nThe Green Goblin 2099 is a playable character and a boss in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.[6] He first appears in Manhattan, after it has been made part of Chronopolis, and fights Spider-Man and Spider-Gwen alongside the Vulture, but both villains are swiftly defeated. Later, the Goblin 2099 obtains a shard of the Nexus of All Realities, which he uses to fuse Venom and Carnage into a new creature, dubbed \"Carnom,\" whom he controls. When Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Spider-Gwen, and Spider-Man 2099 arrive in Nueva York (also part of Chronopolis) and break into Alchemax to retrieve the shard, the Goblin 2099 unleashes Carnom upon them, but they defeat him and free him from the Goblin's control. The Goblin 2099 is last seen being pursued by Carnom in retaliaton for his abuse.\n\nAge of Apocalypse[edit]\n\nIn the Age of Apocalypse reality, Norman Osborn, known as Red, is a terrorist traitor to the human race, a member of Apocalypse's Marauders along with Dirigible, the Owl and Arcade. Red, along with the rest of the Marauders, is eventually killed by Clint Barton and Gwen Stacy.[7]\n\nAvataars: Covenant of the Shield[edit]\n\nIn the miniseries Avataars: Covenant of the Shield, which takes place in an alternative universe referred to as Eurth created by the Shaper of Worlds, the Green Goblin appears as the Goblin King. A small, nimble creature green in color and adorned in purple rags, the Goblin King is shown to speak solely in rhyme and runs a toll booth in the Webwood, extorting goods from travelers along with his henchmen the Six Most Sinister.[8]\n\nEarth X[edit]\n\nIn the alternative future of Earth X, Norman Osborn's business ventures have completely taken over the United States. Citizens work in his businesses, shop in his stores and eat his food. Norman is the prime economic power and de facto ruler of the country. The Terrigen Mists have shaped his face into a saner version of his Goblin mask. He is partially responsible for the deaths of the Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man. The Enforcers and The Vulture seem to serve as his secret service. He is later used as a pawn for the Red Skull, until Spiders Man makes him think he's with Gwen Stacy (in reality the Red Skull) who shoves him out the window where his foot catches on a flag and his neck snaps similar to how Gwen died. Unaware of the irony, Skull orders his corpse be brought back up so he can push him out again, just so he can make a \"splat\" sound.[9][10]\n\nHouse of M[edit]\n\nIn the Spider-Man: House of M from the 2005 Marvel comics series House of M, there are two versions of the Green Goblin.\n\nThe first is Peter's wrestling friend and rival Crusher Hogan, who uses the identity as his wrestling franchise.\n\nThe second is Peter Parker himself, who, feeling guilty posing as a mutant when really he was a human given powers in the usual Spider-Man fashion (radioactive spider bite), poses as the Green Goblin to reveal the information about him being a human to J. Jonah Jameson, his then publicist, and eventually the entire world. Norman Osborn is also present in this continuity, as an industrialist whose company is bought out by Peter.[11]\n\nAmalgam Comics[edit]\n\nIn the Amalgam Comics continuity, Green Goblin was combined with DC's Two-Face to create the Two-Faced Goblin (Harvey Osborn). He originally looked like the Green Goblin when in costume and had Two-Face's half-scarred face under his Goblin mask, but in Dark Claw Adventures #1, he was given a different design with a glider that looked like a giant coin.[volume & issue needed]\n\nWhat The--?![edit]\n\nIn Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, Norman Osborn is a turkey and enemy to Spider-Ham calling himself the Green Gobbler.\n\nMarvel Fairy Tales[edit]\n\nIn issue one of Spider-Man Fairy Tales (an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood) Osborn makes an appearance as one of the woodsmen in the employ of Jameson alongside Peter and Thompson.[12] Norman Osborn and Harry Osborn also appear in issue four of Spider-Man Fairy Tales, a gender-reversed retelling of the story of Cinderella. Norman is the cruel guardian of Peter Parker, and his coat of arms and armor have a goblin/pumpkin motif.[13]\n\nMarvel Noir[edit]\n\nIn the Marvel Noir universe, Norman Osborn is a former circus freak who was mistreated by the audience for his reptile-like skin disorder. This fueled his ambitions in earning his \"respect\" by becoming the major Crime Lord in New York. He used a mask to hide his true appearance. Earning the name \"the Goblin\", he organized his group composing of former circus and carnival freak shows: Kraven the Hunter, Adrian Toomes, and Chameleon.\n\nThe Goblin's reputation earned him as a freelancer from among New York City's politicians and businessmen in hired to commit illegal acts such as suppressing public protests and even acts of assassinations on public objectors. These actions eventually caused him to come into conflict with Spider-Man after he order The Vulture to kill the vigilante's uncle. Later, reporter Ben Urich became a problem for Norman, so the mob boss sent The Chameleon dressed as J. Jonah Jameson to kill him as Osborn kidnapped the real one. After murdering Urich, the Chameleon was killed by Felicia Hardy.\n\nThe Goblin then took Felicia to one of his hideouts, only for Spider-Man track him down. Norman escaped to the sewers with Hardy as Spider-Man was fighting Osborn's thugs. During the battle, Kraven (one of the thugs) hit a glass full of spiders, causing the animals to fall on him. Spider-Man then saved Jameson and went after Osborn. New York City's vigilante and its main mob boss fought until each one of them got unmasked, Spider-Man was revealed to be Peter Parker and Osborn reveals his green and scaled skin to him. Parker decides not to kill Norman, however a spider-infested Kraven then shows up and attacks Osborn, apparently killing him.\n\nIn other media[edit]\n\nThe Noir version of Norman Osborn appears in the video game Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, voiced by Jim Cummings. He tasks his enforcers Hammerhead and the Vulture with retrieving all of the fragments of the Tablet of Order and Chaos in New York. Although Spider-Man manages to keep most of them out of his hands, Osborn eventually does obtain one and absorbs its power, transforming him into a monstrous form (similar to his Ultimate counterpart) with sheer levels of strength. Despite this, the process opens up a massive sore on his back that becomes his only weak point. He then lures Spider-Man to his carnival hideout, using hostages as bait. There, Spider-Man finally defeats the Goblin and claims his fragment.\n\nMarvel Zombies[edit]\n\nIn the Marvel Zombies universe, a zombified Green Goblin appears attacking Galactus alongside several other undead supervillains.[14] Also in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, the zombified Green Goblin, alongside several other undead Spider-Man villains, appears to attack Wolverine and Magneto as the two are saving innocent civilians from zombies. An alternative version of the Green Goblin was also infected by a zombified Spider-Man, causing him to \"participate\" with other zombie members of the Sinister 6 into devouring Peter's friends. Grieving, dumb, angered, and devastated, the Zombie Spider-Man obliterates him along with the other undead Sinister 6 members.[15]\n\nMC2[edit]\n\nNorman Osborn[edit]\n\nIn the MC2 universe, Norman Osborn is very much the same character from his 1996-1999 portion of the original 616 timeline, only in this universe, he abducts Peter's daughter Mayday Parker and leaves her in the care of Allison Mongraine. However, Peter's wayward original clone Kaine, along with a remorseful Mongraine, returns baby May to the Parkers.[volume & issue needed]\n\nTwo years later, Norman would attempt to gain incredible power through the Gathering of Five, but in a final battle with Spider-Man, Osborn is slain in an explosion that also severely injures Peter, costing him one of his legs.[16]\n\nMay would later become a hero in her own right, Spider-Girl.[17]\n\nAfter discovering a living twin of May Parker (kept in suspended animation) among his grandfather's possessions, Normie Osborn wondered whether it was a clone or whether the original Goblin had put the real May in suspended animation and arranged for her parents to receive a clone of May to raise. He visited Élan in prison and questioned her about this, but she refused to say anything. She was then later broken out of jail by an unknown benefactor, then she released the clone May on to the world and towards the original May. She also had Peter Parker kidnapped and brainwashed into thinking he was Norman Osborn.[18] The brainwashed Peter joins with the May clone, who is half symbiote, and becomes the Goblin God.[19] It is through this brainwashing that Norman Osborn's consciousness resurfaces.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn a psychic duel, Peter, Mayday, the clone and the spirit of Aunt May defeated Norman's psychic representation, which in turn cured Peter of his condition, ending Osborn's threat yet again.[20]\n\nFury the Goblin Queen[edit]\n\nÉlan DeJunae, daughter of the San Mardeo DeJunae crime family in South America, is betrothed to Normie Osborn when she is just a baby because of her father's involvement with the Order of the Goblin.[volume & issue needed]\n\nFrom then on, Élan learns the family business and eventually makes connections with the Black Tarantula. She grows up training to follow Norman Osborn's footsteps, and eventually becomes the leader of the Order of the Goblin. Following a near fatal attack on Normie, Élan returns to New York to follow through with their arranged marriage, but Normie was not aware of the betrothal. Meanwhile, Élan and the Black Tarantula plot to use Spider-Girl to destroy Lady Octopus and Canis so they can take control of the New York underworld. Following plans made by Norman Osborn before his death, the Queen of the Goblins tries to dose Normie Osborn with a new version of the Goblin Formula. Spider-Girl manages to defeat Élan, but in the battle, the formula explodes and the Queen escapes.[volume & issue needed]\n\nBecause Normie spurned her and denied his place in the Goblin legacy, Fury crashes his wedding to Brenda Drago and forcibly bonds the Venom-symbiote to him in an attempt to corrupt him. This backfires, as Normie gained control of the symbiote and went on to become a hero. After Fury crashed Normie's wedding, Phil Urich (the good Green Goblin) defeats her and sends her to prison.[volume & issue needed]\n\nNormie Osborn[edit]\n\nMain article: Normie Osborn\n\nNormie Osborn is the son of Harry Osborn and Liz Allan, and the grandson of Norman Osborn. In the alternative timeline of the MC2 universe he becomes the Green Goblin and battles Spider-Man's daughter, May \"Mayday\" Parker, before reforming and becoming her ally.[volume & issue needed]\n\nPhil Urich[edit]\n\nIn the MC2 timeline, Phil Urich marries his girlfriend Meredith and is a forensic scientist and friends with Peter Parker. He is aware of both Peter and Spider-Girl's identities. Phil Urich resumes the Goblin identity, first under the name of the Golden Goblin, then as the Green Goblin with the assistance of Normie Osborn (III). After Phil lost a long series of battles, Normie recreates Phil's original mask, which grants him superhuman strength and other abilities, greatly enhancing his effectiveness. He is also a founding member of the New New Warriors.[21]\n\nNewspaper strip[edit]\n\nIn The Amazing Spider-Man newspaper strip by Stan Lee and Larry Leiber a brief flashback showed Spider-Man fighting the Green Goblin, designed similarly to the version in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, to save Mary Jane.[citation needed]\n\nA later story showing Harry Osborn as the Hobgoblin flashed back to Norman Osborn's death in a battle against Spider-Man and showed Harry's realization that his father was the murderous Green Goblin.[volume & issue needed]\n\nInfinity Warps[edit]\n\nDuring Infinity Wars, when the universe was folded, Norman Osborn got fused with Jack Russell to create Goblin by Night. Norman Russell was cursed to be the Goblin by Night and killed Ben Spector, May Spector and nearly killed Peter Spector leaving Peter to become ArachKnight. During a battle with Peter, Norman was injured and was saved by his son, Harry Russell. While Harry was taking care of his father, Norman lost control and bit Harry, passing the curse to him. Harry now as the new Goblin by Night, starts using the Glider that Peter built for him prior to becoming the Goblin, leaving Norman free from the curse and being forgiven by Peter and decide to find a way to cure Harry.[22]\n\nSpider-Man: Clone Saga[edit]\n\nIn the retelling of the Clone Saga by Tom DeFalco, Norman did not survive his battle with Spider-Man following the death of Gwen Stacy. The Jackal plans to clone him as a plot to torment Ben Reilly and Peter Parker (though they are not aware of this) before he is murdered by Kaine. However, Harry Osborn, who is still alive in this reality, manages to obtain the clone pod and releases Norman. This clone is quite sane due to never being exposed to the goblin formula, and he makes repeated efforts to convince his insane son to stop his maniacal plans. He ultimately sacrifices himself to save the Parkers and baby May from Harry, who swears vengeance.[23]\n\nSpider-Man: India[edit]\n\nSpider-Man: India features Nalin Oberoi, a ruthless businessman in Mumbai, who is ravaging villages for a mystical amulet to connect with evil, supernatural demons who once ruled the world.[24] The process works and transforms Oberoi into \"Green Goblin\". He also transforms a meek doctor into \"Doctor Octopus\" and sends him to find Pavitar Prabhakar (Spider-Man). Oberoi later burns down Pavitar's village (branding it with his initials NO), and kidnaps MJ, and Aunt Maya (Aunt May).[25] At Oberoi HQ, he tries to bring down the demons, until a reformed Octopus and Pavitar attack and rescue the ladies. After killing the doctor, Oberoi is later defeated by Pavitar.[26] Oberoi also has a son mentioned by Pavitar, Hari.[26]\n\nSpider-Man: Life Story[edit]\n\nSpider-Man: Life Story features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age when Peter debuted as Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Osborn loses his memories as the Green Goblin shortly after a fight with Spider-Man. While initially fearful of Osborn getting his memory back and revealing his secret identity, Peter later gives an anonymous tip to the police to get Osborn arrested and prevent the Green Goblin from hurting anyone.\n\nIn 1977, the still imprisoned Norman convinces Harry to suit up as the Black Goblin to steal \"The Gemini Project\" from Miles Warren, which is revealed to be a clone of himself. Harry discovers that Miles also cloned Peter and Gwen Stacy and deduces that Norman cloned Peter because he still considered Peter the more worthy heir. After Peter convinces Harry of his father's manipulations, Harry blows up the containment tubes the clones were in, killing all of them except for Peter's clone. However, Miles reveals that the Gwen in the containment tube was actually the real Gwen.\n\nNorman is eventually released from prison and feigns his old age affecting his mental state before disappearing from the public. In 1995, he reveals Spider-Man's secret identity and information about his clone Ben Reilly to Doctor Octopus, who kidnaps them and threatens Harry into using Oscorp technology to study a way to clone himself. In the process, he discovers that Peter is supposedly the clone while Ben is the original. In the ensuing chaos, Doctor Octopus kills Harry after attempting to kill Peter and Ben. Peter allows Ben to take over his life in New York before tracking down Norman to an industrial area in New Jersey with Jessica Jones' help. Peter reveals he kept tabs on Norman after he was released from prison and knew Norman rigged the machines to trick Peter into thinking he was the clone. After learning of Harry's death from Peter, Norman blames Peter for the incident and tries to attack him, but then dies in his old age cursing Spider-Man.[27]\n\nSpider-Verse[edit]\n\nThere are different versions of Green Goblin in the Spider-Verse storyline:\n\nA version of the Sinister Six appears in Earth-803 calling themselves as the \"Six Men of Sinestry\" and is led by Norman Osborn under the disguise of Green Goblin. They battled Lady Spider and were forced to withdraw when they lost the upper hand, but they succeed in stealing the mayor's plans.[28]\n\nIn Earth-21205, the Green Goblin is murdered by Peter Parker in rage, resulting in Peter being the Hobgoblin due to the trauma of Gwen Stacy's death.[29]\n\nIn Earth-138, Norman \"Ozzy\" Osborn is president of America and leads to wipe out the Anarchic Spider-Man and his Spider-Army. His company Oscorp created Variable Engagement Neuro-sensitive Organic Mesh or V.E.N.O.M. which is used by the Thunderbolt Department, the police and fire department of his regime. He and his Thunderbolt Department were defeated in the battle with Spider-Punk, Spider-Punk smashing Osborn's stomach with a guitar.[30]\n\nIn Earth-3145 where Spider-Man is Ben Parker, the Goblin version is called the Emerald Elf and was briefly shown in a flashback sequence as the killer of Ben's family. He is presumably killed when a scheme by Doctor Octopus resulted in a nuclear apocalypse.[31]\n\nDifferent versions of the Goblin's identity appear including a Green Goblin which is part of Verna's Hounds.[31] They are killed by Assassin Spider-Man, Superior Spider-Man, and Spider-Punk.\n\nUltimate Marvel[edit]\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Norman Osborn is a corrupt industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D., an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife Martha Osborn and son Harry Osborn. When an OZ-injected spider bites Peter Parker on a field trip,[32] and develops amazing abilities, Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA were behind Parker's abilities of a spider, then Norman with OZ combined with his own DNA would become a heightened version of himself. But his experiment goes wrong,[33] and he himself is transformed into a muscular, grotesque, goblin-looking monster, granting him superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina, speed and durability, and enabling him to leap great distances. He is also pyrokinetic, as he can throw flaming balls of destructive energy. His alter-ego is later referred to as the \"Green Goblin\" by the public.\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited[edit]\n\nA Counter-Earth version of the Green Goblin appeared in the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series, voiced by Rino Romano. This version's alter-ego is Hector Jones, and is portrayed as a hero who is helping the rebellion against the High Revolutionary. He also uses a backpack that sprouts wings instead of a glider.\n\nThe Goblin first appears in the episode \"Where Evil Nests\", when mistaking Spider-Man for a villain, and soon teams up with him to save Naoko Yamada-Jones and Shayne Yamada-Jones from one of Venom's and Carnage's plans; it is also implied that the Goblin himself is Naoko's jealous ex-husband. In \"Sustenance\", the Goblin learns Spider-Man's secret identity and that he is from Earth, having come here to rescue John Jameson, but since Jameson refuses to leave until the High Revolutionary is defeated, the Goblin offers to help Spider-Man regain his ship from the High Evolutionary. The pair team up with the Rejects, a group of Beastials that the High Evolutionary got rid of since they proved useless, to do so, only for Spider-Man to then crash the ship into one of the High Evolutionary's towers. In the series finale, \"Destiny Unleashed\", the Goblin is revealed to have survived and joined the Rejects, and briefly leaves them to help Spider-Man and the rebels fight against the High Evolutionary. He is one of the characters who run off when thousands of symbiotes are unleashed upon Counter-Earth according to Venom's and Carnage's plans.\n\nThe Spider-Man Unlimited comics that tie in with the series depict the Green Goblin's first encounter with Spider-Man, and their rescue of several Beastials and humans from Venom and Carnage's cluthces.[34] Later, the Goblin helps Spider-Man look in the sewers for the missing people that were kidnapped by an octopus-like creature. They fight the creature that took them to a place called \"Heaven\" where they were taken hostage by the villagers, but were rescued by a Counter-Earth version of Gwen Stacy that lived in this village.[35]\n\nGold Goblin[edit]\n\nIn the New Exiles comic series, Norman Osborn of Earth-812145 of the Marvel Universe is an insane criminal called The Gold Goblin. The Gold Goblin was stopped by the Exiles after he began to wreak havoc on his home world.[36]\n\nSpider-Geddon[edit]\n\nIn the Spider-Geddon storyline, Norman Osborn of Earth-44145 is a six-armed version of Spider-Man. As Norman is informed of his son Harry Osborn moving through Oscorp and having been secretly armed, he is told that Harry is on the 15th floor near Mr. Warren's lab. Being Spider-Man and arriving where a warped Cosmic Cube is located, Norman confronts Harry who dons the Kobold armor. It was revealed during the fight that Norman killed Peter Parker as Harry fires a laser beam at the warped Cosmic Cube. As Oscorp starts to disintegrate, Norman is pleased that Harry finally gave him what he wanted by accidentally giving him access to the multiverse. Just then, Spider-Punk arrives and pulls Norman much to his dismay.[37] Norman is among the spider-powered characters that are on Superior Spider-Man's team. After Superior Spider-Man's group rescues Miles Morales's group from the Inheritors at the New U Technologies building, Norman has a talk with Spiders-Man of Earth-11580 about his vision on the Web of Life and Destiny as they have a secret strategy to keep the Inheritors on Earth-616.[38] After destroying the Web of Life along with Spiders-Man, he is seen holding a piece of the Web inside a container with an evil smile on his face.[39] In the 2019 Superior Spider-Man series, he reappears on Earth-616, along with Spiders-Man who had been spying on Otto Octavius, while Norman plans his revenge.[40]\n\nIn Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors, Norman Osborn as Green Goblin (voiced by Steven Weber) further mutates himself into the Spider-Goblin after splicing himself with the DNA of interdimensional Spider-Men.\n\nIn Marvel's Spider-Man, Norman Osborn (voiced by Josh Keaton) eventually mutates into the Spider King due to exposure to Raymond Warren's spider virus.\n\nDuring the return of the Inheritors, Spider-Gwen's device to travel through the multiverse got destroyed by Verna and then Spider-Gwen got stranded in an alternate universe.[41] In this universe, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy got a job at Oscorp and Peter wanted to create a cure for severe illness. Peter was experimenting with spider venom to create the cure but one of the spiders bit Harry Osborn instead, and thus is this universe's Spider-Man. Harry alongside Gwen as this universe's Green Goblin started to fight crime together, until during a fight with the Sandman, both Harry and Gwen's father got killed. After that, Gwen lost all of memories, forgetting about Peter and Mary Jane.[42]\n\nOn Earth-11580, another version of Green Goblin is seen alongside Hobgoblin, Demogoblin and Jack O'Lantern during the Goblin Night. Under the Goblin Queen's orders, they try to kill Gwen Stacy, but Spiders-Man arrives and defeats the Goblins.[43]\n\nLego Marvel Super Heroes[edit]\n\nMain article: Lego Marvel Super Heroes\n\nIn the video game Lego Marvel Super Heroes, set in a reality identified as Earth-13122, Norman Osborn is the head of Oscorp, while his alter ego, the Green Goblin, is one of Spider-Man's main enemies. In the game, the Goblin is among the supervillains that help Doctor Doom obtain pieces of the Silver Surfer's board. He retrieves one from a defeated Doctor Octopus, and later escapes from Spider-Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, who came to Oscorp to claim it back, by pitting them against Venom. Later, the Fantastic Four and Nick Fury encounter the Goblin at Castle Doom in Latveria, and defeat him. In the final level, he is one of the villains enlisted by Fury to aid the heroes in stopping Loki and Galactus from destroying Earth and Asgard.\n\nMarvel Gamerverse[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Man (2018 video game)\n\nIn the 2018 Spider-Man video game, set in a reality identified as Earth-1048, Norman Osborn is elected the mayor of New York, and it's revealed prior to this, he and Dr. Otto Octavius created Oscorp Industries together. Still running Oscorp, he searches for a cure for a genetic disease his son Harry who inherited from his mother and in this process resulted in Mister Negative getting his powers and the creation of GR-27, a deadly serum dubbed \"Devil's Breath.\" With the help of Wilson Fisk, he had set up research labs around the city so he could keep working secretly. He shows dislike against Spider-Man and he even blames him for the release of Devil's Breath in city and orders Silver Sable to capture him. He is later captured by a vengeful Octavius, now the supervillain Doctor Octopus, who threatens him to admit that he cheated Otto out of his contribution to Oscorp. However, Norman only insults him, saying Otto was only ever worth anything working for him. He is saved by Spider-Man after Doc Ock drops him. Following the final battle against the two, Norman rescinds as mayor and goes to his secret lab, which held modified spider specimens (one of which bit Miles Morales) where it's revealed that he had put Harry in a chamber and bonded him to GR-35, as life support. In his home, he has a technological helmet and when wearing it, it shows a glider. In the lab, there are also purple hand-grenades near a little green container. When talking to Harry, the green light from Harry's chamber reflects on Norman's face, all of which possibly allude to him becoming the Green Goblin in the future.[44]\n\nWhat If?[edit]\n\nDark Reign: Infinity Gauntlet[edit]\n\nIn an alternate reality, Osborn acquired the Infinity Gems after manipulating an army of villains to do the work for him and used them to reassemble the Infinity Gauntlet, defeating most of the heroes while trapping Spider-Man in a time loop where he witnesses/\"causes\" Gwen Stacy's death over and over again. However, when Norman uses the Gauntlet's power to resurrect his abusive father to show him what he has accomplished, his father dismisses him as a petty tyrant and a monster until Norman uses the Gauntlet to change his father's opinion. When Thanos appears, killing the rest of the Dark Avengers while taunting Osborn about the hollow nature of his father's current approval, Osborn destroys him, but when his altered father only says that he loves Norman as a son, Osborn erases him in a fit of anger as he wanted to be praised for his accomplishments, realizing too late that erasing his father automatically erases him as well.\n\nReferences[edit]"
