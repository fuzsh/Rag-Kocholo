        "text": "Manga or Japanese comics and their animated version, anime, are some of the most popular forms of contemporary entertainment media in Japan and increasingly beyond. Sales of manga in Japan, including both print and digital forms, amounted to 445 billion yen (about US$ 3,998 million) in 2016 (AJPEA/The Research Institute for Publications, 2017). Abroad, translation of manga into English began in the late 1980s. Anime became popular first, but manga, on which a lot of anime was based, became known to Western audiences in the late 1980s. Since then the manga fandom expanded, furthered by the use of the internet. Today, license sales outside Japan have reached 11 billion yen (about US$ 988 million) for print sales and about 20 billion yen (about US$ 1,797 million) for anime (Digital Contents Association, 2015). These sales exclude illegal circulation, particularly on the internet, which the Japanese government and manga artists are well aware of. This, ironically, confirms the popularity of manga abroad. While illegally circulated contents are those originally published in Japan, manga today are created elsewhere by non-Japanese artists too. There are at least two reasons manga are important for gender and media scholars. First, they represent a significant form of contemporary entertainment media which is popular and gendered in terms of production, text, and audience. They are consumed widely, their influence is hard to ignore, and there are a number of gender and sexuality issues regarding manga that call for scholarly attention. As discussed below, manga includes a variety of genres and representations that are structurally gendered. Second, the fact that manga are gendered does not necessarily mean that they are closed from any possibility of innovation and intervention. Scholars have, in fact, identified not only gender-conforming but also gender-upsetting elements in sociocultural phenomena regarding manga. This makes manga an interesting research object for gender and media scholars who are engaged with feminist questions and exploring the possibility of change in the media. Research about manga started to develop in the 1980s into a growing, interdisciplinary field in which both academics and nonacademics are engaged in examining manga from various perspectives including the perspective of gender. Manga scholars have so far traced the history, unique visual styles, genres, and transnational diffusion of manga and their popularity. Many studies do not include any gender analysis at their core, but some gender scholars have shown concern about gendered dimensions of manga and their cultural implications. Scholars generally agree that manga in their contemporary form emerged in the mid-20th century in the early post-World War II era, although some scholars stress the cultural continuity of manga in earlier periods: before Japan's modernization in the\n\nOriginally intended to be a leisurely comic strip with paintings and pictorial representations, manga has emerged as a 'soft power' of modern-day Japan. As the world's largest manga exporter today, the country is considered to be a manga superpower. Its influence on a fanbase spread across the globe has proved to be a noteworthy component in developing cross-cultural empathy within the readers. Despite its traction, the genre entered the literati only recently. Many researchers have analysed the influence of Japanese traditions, history as well as culture upon modern-day manga and their adaptations. Several researchers have also attempted to study the intercultural translation of manga and the influence of manga across countries. The growing emergence of cultural studies as a field of enquiry and manga as a cultural and literary product provides the base for the current article. With the country's hybrid culture filled with urban and modern legends, myths, traditions and folklore, most of the stories created in manga are steeped in indigenous culture and are combined with modern lifestyle to create a unique reading experience. This renders these graphic novels as cultural products of manga, which are commodified and read throughout the world. The present article acts as a review of contemporary research in the field of manga as a cultural product and identifies its relevance in spreading Japanese cultural identity, thereby contributing to a global cultural identity. The study opens up new lenses to look at manga as cultural products of the 21st century and broadens the scope of recognizing individual and collective manga series for further research as expounders of Japanese cultural identity.\n\nLiteratureâ€™s qualities can be highlighted by combining it with other forms of art. Manga, which is a Japanese traditional literary genre that involves visual art, has gained worldwide popularity in the last few decades. Subsequently, it was adapted into anime. This study explores the legitimacy of manga in literature, its global influence among notable figures such as prime ministers or presidents, and the zenith it attained in anime, which is a universal language. Are manga and anime universal solely due to their graphics and stories? Or is it rather because of their ability to connect people to the sacred? Is image universal? If so, what kind of image? Static one? Moving one? Which, manga or anime, can rather be considered universal? What does the future hold for literature and its various adaptations?"
