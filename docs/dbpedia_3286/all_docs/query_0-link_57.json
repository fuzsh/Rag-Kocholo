Over the past two decades manga has spread from being a quirky style of comics to being the new comic-book art format. In 2007, Daniel Pink claimed that manga is the “hottest trend in American publishing” (in Wired Magazine http:// www.wired.com/wired/issue/15-11) with good reason: it was the ﬁrst year that a manga title was ranking in USA Today’s best-seller list (Fruits Basket, Volume 16). Around the same time, the media was abuzz with the release of Selfmadehero’s Shakespearean manga, and Japan’s International Manga Awards. Manga was well and truly internationally accepted. But manga is not an overnight sensation, manga ﬁrst appeared outside Japan in the 1970s; however it was through anime that manga came to the attention of the general populace. Now it is diﬃcult to get away from manga. Borders oﬀer gift cards with a Naturo-esque character, the Bible has been mangaﬁed and the manga sections at bookshops continue to expand. This volume reﬂects the global impact of manga on comic book scholarship and contains essays from comic book scholars in Australia, Europe and the United States.\n\nMANGA AND COMIC BOOK SCHOLARSHIP Considerable ink has been spent trying to deﬁne comics by Scott McCloud (Understanding Comics), Will Eisner (Comics and Sequential Art), David Carrier (The Aesthetics of Comics), and Roger Sabin (Adult Comics).2 Manga adds yet another layer to the “long and complicated” evolution of comics (Sabin 1993, 1). Even a seemingly self-evident description such as “manga is sequential art” is riddled with exceptions: manga is not always sequential (chronologically, anyway) and some might argue that it is not art. Manga\n\n2\n\nMANGA\n\nis a visual narrative with a recognizable “sensibility.” The term sensibility is intentionally vague in order to cover a multitude of options and embraces the stereotypical big-eyed, pointy chinned characters that many people consider the epitome of manga, the Disneyesque style of Osamu Tezuka, and the realistic style of corporate manga. Not all manga looks the same and not all manga has the same philosophical issues or the same readership. If it calls itself manga, then it is manga.3 What manga is not is anime. Though anime often evolves from manga, the two are not synonymous. Since the ﬁrst cavewoman scratched her story on a wall, humankind has used the visual for storytelling. Egyptian hieroglyphics in tombs immortalize a life, the Elgin Marbles depict battle scenes, and the Bayeux Tapestry retells the Norman conquest of England; painters have re-created Christian mythologies (Michaelangelo’s Sistine Chapel) and satirized human foibles (William Hogarth and Thomas Rowlandson). Arguably the ﬁrst graphic novel was Rudolph Topﬀer’s Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois (1827); the ﬁrst cartoon “strip” with regular characters was Wilhelm Busch’s Max und Moritz (1865). The ﬁrst recognizable American comic character, Richard F. Outcault’s Yellow Kid, appeared in Joseph Pulitzer’s newspaper New York World in 1895. By the end of the 1920s, newspapers and periodicals oﬀered installments of Harold R. Foster’s Tarzan (1929), Chic Young’s Blondie (1930), and Chester Gould’s Dick Tracy (1931). Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster’s Superman premiered in Action Comics’ ﬁrst issue in 1938. By the mid-twentieth century, comics were so ﬁrmly entrenched in popular culture, that pop artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein celebrated the comic aesthetic in their art. Despite the censorship and moral panics of the mid-twentieth century, and the disinterest of the 1960s and 1970s, comic books retained a place in the publishing industry. At the end of the 1980s, the graphic novel had injected new life into the format. During the 1990s a concatenation of cultural events saw the rise of visual reading material: the Internet, computer games, graphic novels, and globalization fostered the spread of Japanese popular culture and in particular the introduction of anime and manga. The uptake of the graphic novel and the popularity of manga reminded academics and popular culture experts that comics are worthy of further investigation. Frederik Schodt’s Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics (1983) was the ﬁrst book to introduce manga to the non-Japanese and it remains a seminal text for manga investigation. Since then Sharon Kinsella, Paul Gravett, and Anne Allison have all written inﬂuential books. Kinko Ito and Fusami Ogi have furthered the study of manga with their academic articles. In the past ten years, manga has become cool. Manga: An Anthology of Global and Cultural Perspectives is divided into four sections: the ﬁrst provides an overview of manga history, manga in the United States, and manga genres; the second contains detailed analyses of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nmanga-ka and their material; the third examines manga as a new style of visual narrative; and the ﬁnal section considers the global outreach of manga.\n\nFIGURE I.1: Manga anthologies and tanko¯bons. © 2008, Toni Johnson-Woods.\n\nUsed by permission.\n\nMANGA FORMATS Manga is delivered in two print formats, the manga magazine and the tankōbon (see ﬁg. I.1). The magazines, as Christopher Couch notes (chapter 12 in this volume), have inherited characteristics from their publication forebears: serialized novels and superhero pulps. They contain multiple instalments of serialized stories; for instance, in January 2008 Square Enix had over 20 serialized stories in its nearly 900 pages, Comic Blade contained 17 stories in 550 pages, and Morning crammed 21 stories into 430 pages. Each magazine has a targeted readership. For example, Weekly Morning (with its catch phrase “Morning Gets You Going”) targets an older readership; it favors adult content, and its politics, history, and sporting manga are depicted in a more realistic style. The paper quality of the magazines is poor (insatsu senkashi) because they are made from recycled paper. As one editor recalls, “Manga used to be printed with some colors in them, but it was too expensive, so we started to print only with black ink on some colored paper. This was convenient for\n\n4\n\nMANGA\n\nboth the printing oﬃce and the publisher” (“Why Do Manga Magazines Use Colored Paper?”). After the paper is de-inked it is oﬀ-white, and publishers then add colors; these colors indicate a change of story. As can be seen in ﬁg. I.1, diﬀerent magazines adopt diﬀerent colors: “Seinen magazines opt for a shades from cream to light orange while shōnen magazines and shōjo magazines, prefer intense colors” like yellow, orange, and green (“Why Do Manga Magazines Use Colored Paper?”). Whatever colors are used inside, outside the magazines share the same crammed hypervisual covers — which, surprisingly, blend both Japanese and English words. At around ¥300 for over ﬁve hundred pages, manga magazines represent value for money. Though it has been claimed that manga prices have been steadily increasing, analysis has found that this is not the case; in fact, “the price of weekly manga magazines have remained stagnant for the past 30 years” and that manga still sells at “around 0.5 yen per page” (“An Analysis of Weekly Manga Magazines Price for the Past 30 Years”). Still, not everyone buys their manga. It is common to see people crowd around the magazine shelves reading — tachiyomi (standing reading), a practice one would assume is frowned upon in the United States and Australia, but this is not the case, as a quick visit to the manga section of any bookstore will show (see ﬁg. I.2).\n\nFIGURE I.2: Readers at manga bookshop. © 2008, Toni Johnson-Woods.\n\nUsed by permission.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nThere does not generally appear to be the “collectibility” ethos evidenced among Western comic enthusiasts, many of whom wrap their goods in archival sleeves never to be opened. Recently, though, reissues of “classic” manga have become increasingly popular (Satō, 2006). The reason for this new niche? According to Satō’s article, mature fans are keen to ﬁll the gaps from their youth; and there is nostalgia, and, of course, the increase in manga research by scholars. All of the readers whom I interviewed in Japan said they bought their copies at railway stations because they read them over the course of several days during their commutes to work. However, manga can also be purchased in bookstores, from vending machines, or from indigents who collect discarded copies and resell them to new readers. Successful serialized manga are reprinted as tankōbon.4 They are of a better quality than the anthologies and are similar to paperbacks; they sell in bookshops for around ¥500 each. If standing at a convenience store reading manga does not appeal, manga kissa oﬀers readers a library of manga material. Manga kissa are Internetstyle cafés that stock hundreds and even thousands of manga;6 for around ¥500 per hour, readers can occupy a small cubicle and read manga, use the Internet, play video games, watch DVDs, and so on.7 Recently manga kissa have attracted unfavorable press attention because they have been used as refuges for the homeless or pick-up joints for prostitutes and because they don’t pay royalties or lending rights (Kyodo News 2007). Still they continue to grow — from three hundred cafés nationwide in 1998 to two thousand in 2002 (Japan Forum), spreading to Europe, the United States, and Australia.\n\nMANGA’S PLACE IN COMIC CULTURE Manga diﬀers from Western-style comic books in several salient ways. Eijiro Shimada of Kodansha claims that “the main diﬀerence between manga and comics is that manga focuses on one main character. The reader follows in the footsteps of that character and sees everything through the character’s eyes” (Cha 2007). The most obvious visual feature is that manga mimic an Asian reading orientation; that is to say, manga are read from back to front and right to left. The next most glaring diﬀerence is that they are largely rendered in black and white, lacking the hypercoloring of Western comics. Inside, the frames are not always neat rectangles lined up equidistant (i.e., four to a line and four lines to a page); there can be one, two, or seven frames on a page. The manga aesthetic embraces a myriad of graphic techniques — the Disneyesque styles of Tezuka, the precision of the mechas (robot manga) or the softness of the shōjo (girls’ manga). Often drawing techniques are mixed on the same page; thus, the same character can be rendered as a full-sized angular person or a small chubby one. The words are\n\n6\n\nMANGA\n\nFIGURE I.3 (left): From Queenie Chan, The Dreaming, vol. 1. FIGURE I.4 (right): From Queenie Chan, The Dreaming, vol. 1.\n\nfew — manga relies more heavily on visual cues and adopts cinematic techniques such as close-ups and freeze frames. Sound eﬀects also add texture to the story. The use of sound eﬀects is quintessentially Japanese and reﬂects the onomatopoeia of the Japanese language (Neil Cohn’s chapter discusses the visual language more fully), in From Eroica with Love (a campy James Bond manga) cars go sweesh and helicopters go kacha. The illustrations from Queenie Chan’s The Dreaming demonstrate some of these manga traits (see ﬁgs. I.3 and I.4). For the ﬁrst-time Western reader, manga is a visual, textual, and intellectual challenge. Tracking the narrative via an unfamiliar reading system, Japanese characters,8 and limited visual cues can leave the newbie manga reader shaking her head. However, once the skill of “reading” manga is conquered, the manga is a rich experience. Several scholars have explored the issue of Eastern versus Western ways of reading manga. Mary Grigsby claims that the Japanese are “used to reading pictures” (1998, 67); Wired reporter Daniel Pink underwent an experiment conducted by a developmental psychologist who studies how the eyes and brain collaborate to “process complex images like the mixture of words and images found in manga” and found that manga readers’ eyes “slalomed smoothly from page edge to page edge, rarely stopping at the text. In fact, there were portions of pages that his eyes never touched — because,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nas Nakazawa explained, Keito was either processing the words through his peripheral vision or simply imputing what was there. Like a seasoned skier, he moved with great speed yet remained acutely aware of his surroundings” (Pink 2007).9 Furthermore, this controversial type of cultural coding is part of research, such as the work done by Richard Nisbett, who claims that East Asians are more “collectivist” and Westerners more “individualist” in their cognitive processes. Neil Cohn’s essay on the visual language of manga in this volume (chapter 11) provides a linguistically attuned analysis of manga and its narrative processes; he expands Schodt’s hypothesis that manga is another language with a unique grammar. A brief glance at a manga page demonstrates that manga diﬀers from Western-style comics in many ways. Most obvious is the page layout; not merely reading left to right or whatever system ﬁts within the page (in the above instance the ﬁnal statement is the solitary bubble on the left-hand page) but following the oddly shaped frames in the correct sequence can be confusing, and sometimes the words don’t help. In other words, the narrative ﬂow is not as simplistic as that in Western comics. Also startling is the visual aesthetic: the wide variety of frames, the highly detailed backgrounds which often dwarf the characters, the chibi (small renditions of characters which indicate anger or frustration); and the cinematic angles ﬂavour the narratives. Even though the illustrations are in black and white the inking, shading, and toning produce diﬀering eﬀects, as Mio Bryce discusses in chapter 8 of this volume. In many manga, especially historical (Vagabond), CLAMP work (XXX-Holic), Victoriana-inspired (The Cain Saga), and children’s (Dr. Slump) books, the amount of detail in each frame can be confusing to the eye. One of the most controversial issues has been the use of the honorifics sama, sensei, kun, and chan, among others — Japanese words that give readers subtle clues as to the relationships between the characters. The rather insensitive mishandling of honoriﬁcs in early translations concerned American otaku who wanted “uncorrupted” texts; as manga fan Stacy Rue explains, American fans want to have the same experience with the translated text as the Japanese audience has with the original manga, in a literal rather than ﬁgurative sense. And as American fans interact online with manga fans not only in Japan, but in France, Germany, and other Western countries, we are keenly aware that U.S. publishers are under more pressure (both real and imagined) to change or adapt manga to suit the conservative American cultural norms as compared to other translations by Western publishers. So as American otaku, we remain vigilant for any possible alterations, not only to protect the manga but to ensure our ability to participant in the global manga community.10\n\nJames Rampant (chapter 13) agrees that “what fans want, fans get” in his\n\n8\n\nMANGA\n\nexploration of the impact of scanlation, the practice of fans’ translation of manga into their own languages in which devotees “scan” their favorite manga and translate the Japanese text. It is a thriving underworld that challenges publishing orthodoxy by oﬀering translated material on the Internet free of charge. Obviously there are copyright issues and, of course, it’s a problematic area. Even though it is piracy, scanlation has had positive impact. As Rue notes, fans feel protective of their favorite manga, and Rampant demonstrates how the publishing companies have adopted and adapted aspects of scanlated material into their publications. Another mineﬁeld is the issue of essentialism — are manga-style comics written by the British, Australians, Koreans, or Americans truly “manga”? A recent book, Mangaka America, celebrates nine artists (Steelriver Studio and Adam Warren, 2006), and “Shakespeare Manga” by Emma Hayley of SelfMadeHero — the UK company that made worldwide headlines with its Shakespeare adaptations — demonstrates that the manga style has successfully extended beyond the solely Japanese mangaka, or comic artist. Hayley’s essay in chapter 16 provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how her idea progressed to a ﬁnished and internationally recognized manga product.11\n\nREADING MANGA If you thought manga was “doe-eyed girls with melon-sized breasts, slasher samurai, resilient teenage heroines wielding magical powers and adventurous ninja boys” (Birmingham 2008), then think again. There is manga for every taste, age group, and interest. As such it almost becomes meaningless to try to describe the genres, since for every description there will be a manga that doesn’t conform. However, in order to impose some classiﬁcation on the thousands of titles, genres are handy, if not always accurate, labels. Anthologies are printed by publishers who deliberately target certain readerships;12 thus, manga are shaped to conform to an editor’s expectations. The Japanese manga genres therefore reﬂect the genre of anthologies in which the manga appear: shōnen (boys’ manga, such as Shōnen Jump and Shōnen Sunday), shōjo (girls’ manga, such as Princess and Margaret), seinen manga (men’s manga, such as Big Comic Spirits and Business Jump) and josei manga (women’s manga,13 such as Be Love and Oﬃce You) — and then it starts to get a little more complicated. Below is a list of names commonly used in relation to manga; however, some meanings diﬀer between the United States and Japan, and the terms can and do change over time: Name(s) Do¯jinshi\n\nLiteral Translation Same person, same magazine\n\nDescription Amateur or fan manga; can be yaoi, sho¯ nen, and seinen.\n\nINTRODUCTION Gekiga\n\nDramatic pictures\n\nHentai15\n\nSexual perversion\n\nJosei, Redı¯su, Ladies’ comics Redi Komi Redı¯su Komikku Kodomo\n\nChildren\n\nMecha Sho¯nen-ai Yaoi\n\nMechanical Boy love Acronym for Yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi “No climax, no point, no meaning”. Girl love\n\nYuri Sho¯jo-ai\n\n9\n\nAdult manga that explores serious topics. The most explicit material comes from the United States. Adult women’s issues as wives and ofﬁce workers; examples include Comic Amour (anthology), Paradise Kiss, Tramps Like Us. Includes pronunciation guide as children learn to read. Robots and transformers. Male love stories. Male homosexual stories; Male/male love stories written for women.\n\nGirl/girl love stories.\n\nAside from the confusing profusion of manga genres, more traditional categories such as romance, fantasy, and science ﬁction can be and are used to classify manga. In his extensive manga guide, Jason Thompson (2007) assigns each of the more than one thousand manga genres more meaningful descriptors; for example, Monster is “Seinen, Thriller” (227) and Fruits Basket is “Shojo, Fantasy, Romantic Comedy, Drama” (114). Thompson embellishes the broad publishing categories because they are such umbrella terms. In their essays in this volume, Mio Bryce and Jason Davis, Jennifer Prough, and Angela Drummond-Mathews point out that the four basic genre labels are by no means indicative of manga readership; the energy and inventiveness of essentially children’s fare such as Dr Slump and Dragon Ball can also make for enjoyable adult reading. In chapter 2, Bryce and Davis divide about one hundred manga into ten categories such as humor, religion and spirituality, and war. These headings make more sense than the broad age/gender divide because they encapsulate the “sensibilities” of manga better. Bryce and Davis brieﬂy trace the development of each type, identify its major elements, and explore the “salient aspects” within each. For the new manga reader the surprise might be the high number of sports manga. Sabin (1993) nominates sport as the second biggest genre, and claims that this is because sport has been viewed by Japanese society as “a testing of the spirit” (202). Angela Drummond-Mathews (chapter 3) discusses the plethora of sports\n\n10\n\nMANGA\n\nmanga in her chapter on shōnen manga, “What Boys Will Be.” After outlining the rise of diﬀerent types of boys’ manga, she then examines the stories through a Joseph Campbell–inﬂuenced mythological framework. She notes the reciprocal nature of readership — boys’ manga has added romantic subplots and girls’ manga now includes kickass heroines (Gunslinger). Girls’ manga is the focus of two chapters. Mark McLelland (chapter 4) delves into one of manga’s most curious characters, the bishōnen, in which he teases out the cultural inﬂuences that have spawned female romance comics that have, at their center, male homosexual love; he concludes that through these “feminine” males, female readers imaginatively refashion their romantic and sexual selves. Tania Darlington and Sara Cooper (chapter 9) explore manga’s ﬂuid approach to gender and sexuality. Three essays in this volume engage with more speciﬁc facets of manga. Philip Brophy, the curator of the traveling Tezuka — The Marvel of Manga exhibit, looks at the cultural ramiﬁcations of mask in Tezuka’s manga (chapter 7); and imaginary worlds are the focus of two case studies, Marc Hairston’s messianic reading of Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (chapter 10) and Mio Bryce’s examination of the themes of Kyōko Hikawa’s Kanata kara (From Far Away; chapter 8). Much of the scholarship to date has focused on manga genres and readership. However, the creation of manga is equally fascinating, for manga is often the result of collaborative eﬀorts, as one editor describes the process, “the idea for a story is dropped into a deep pool and the artist and editor put a lot of eﬀort into trying to dig it out . . . the pool has to be deep enough for the artist . . . if it’s only a shallow pool, you can pull out a little rock easily but that’s not real manga” (Cha 2007). In chapter 5 Jennifer Prough presents an industrially attuned examination of shōjo; she draws upon her ﬁeld research to show the impact of culture and editors upon shōjo narratives, and the success that shōjo has enjoyed in the United States.\n\nMANGA AND THE WORLD Timothy J. Craig has noted that Japanese pop culture has “attracted a broad street-level following overseas” (2000, 4), and nowhere is this truer than in the uptake of manga. If manga are comics written by the Japanese for Japanese consumption, then how and why have they become such a global media phenomenon? The Internet has obviously fostered the spread of manga. In addition to scanlation sites, there is a Wikipedia manga subset; publishers have websites; and there are multitudes of mangaka who use the Internet to demonstrate their skills. Nowadays, the “ﬂow” goes both ways — in and out of Japan — and Japanese publishers such as Kondasha seek to inject new life into manga\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nby holding international competitions. In 2006, Kondasha announced its ﬁrst international manga competition; the following year Eijiro Shimada, editor-in-chief of Kondansha’s Morning Two, and Yukari Shiiina, president of world-mag.com (a literary agency for non-Japanese manga) visited the San Diego, California, Comic-Con to ﬁnd new manga talent. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Shimada explains that while he was impressed by the number of manga in bookstores he found the quality disappointing. Too many submissions to Morning’s competition were Naruto wannabes. The limitation demonstrated by overseas competitors highlights how little manga is understood. It’s supposed to be free and unrestricted, Shimada explains, and Japanese fans are interested in manga from Italy and Germany. Wendy Siuyi Wong (chapter 20) charts the globalization of manga, and John Lent (chapter 18) concentrates on complex censorship and local cultural issues that the inﬂux of manga has raised in China, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan. Paul Malone (chapter 19) provides an overview of manga in continental Europe and the United Kingdom. Jean-Marie Bouissou, Marco Pellitteri, and Bernd Dolle-Weinkauﬀ (chapter 15) distributed a ﬁfteenpage survey to fans at manga conventions in France, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland; the results show that fans’ reasons for reading manga are not as simplistic as one would imagine. Jason Bainbridge and Craig Norris (chapter 14) trace the “ﬂow” of manga into Australia and its impact upon the Australian comics scene. Another obvious marker of the internationality of manga is the surge in international manga competitions. Anime and manga publisher Tokyopop has instigated the Rising Stars of Manga competition in the United States and in the United Kingdom. And, beginning in 2007, the Japanese government has instigated the International Manga Award in order to promote international diplomacy in the belief that popular culture can play a role in diplomacy and that manga can “enhance understanding of Japanese culture” (Ministry of Foreign Aﬀairs of Japan, 2007). The second International Manga Award competition attracted more than double the number of entries than the ﬁrst had — 368 entries from 46 countries and regions: Asia: 156 United States: 66 Europe: 114 Paciﬁc Region: 4 Middle East: 23 Africa: 5 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan 2008)\n\nEuropean countries have also cast their manga nets wider; Spanish publisher Norma Editorial has announced its Third Manga Competition for 2008.\n\n12\n\nMANGA\n\nCONCLUSION That Warren Buﬀet, Cup O’ Noodles, and William Shakespeare all share a publishing format gestures to the wide variety of manga available and the global spread of manga and its commercial, aesthetic, and educational value. What is less surprising is how each culture deals with similar issues; Warren Buﬀet stars in his own biographical story, whereas in writer Tadashi Katoh and artist Akira Imai’s Project X: Nissin Cup Noodle the development of the ideal cup of noodles is clearly outlined as a team eﬀort. Today one can buy the manga Bible and Beowulf manga; any story that can be told can be drawn. Manga’s contribution to popular culture is fascinating because it is essentially a comic book, and comic books have always been ignored (at best) and condemned (at worst). Manga has caused moral panics about its violence and sexual content even though it grapples with deep philosophical questions: to be or not to be (Conﬁdential Confessions), the nature of war (Barefoot Gen), what is it to be male or female (Yours and My Secret), the environment (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind), the essence of evil (Death Note), and what it means to be human (Ghost in a Shell). It is a complex visual art form, an aesthetic with proven worldwide appeal. Manga is essentially ephemeral entertainment, something to be bought and discarded; yet, for over sixty years it has provided entertainment to millions of people.\n\nNotes 1. See Katoh and Imai 2006; Morio, 2005; and Shakespeare, 2007. 2. Comics is shorthand for a variety of visual formats: one-frame gags (The Far Side), multiframe strips (Peanuts), serialized narratives (Mandrake), comic books (Casper the Friendly Ghost), and the graphic novel — though the adult content of the graphic novel sets it apart in that it often lacks a “comedic” tone. And, of course, comics embraces genres as diverse as the superhero (Superman) and teenage life (Archie). 3. For a summary of these issues see Meskin 2007. 4. The longest-running manga is Osamu Akimoto’s Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kouenmae Hashutsujo (This Is the Police Box in Front of Kameari Park in Katsushika Ward). Kochikame, as it is commonly known, portrays the comic adventures of policeman Ryo-san; the series has been running in Shōnen Jump since 1976. It has appeared in more than 1,100 issues and been reissued in more than 150 tankōbon. 5.

When it entered the non-Japanese comics market — ﬁrst in the United States, France, and Italy during the 1980s — most sophisticated Nipponophiles disliked it at ﬁrst sight because it seemed so foreign to the traditional Japanese culture as symbolized by Confucian morality, Zen gardens, and the mono no aware (the pathos of things or the ahh-ness) of cherry blossoms. However, these “Japan lovers” overlooked the fact that the Japanese culture of samurai and aristocratic elites has always coexisted with the hedonist, unbridled, and rebellious popular cultures of Japanese peasantry and townspeople (chônin), which makes much room for amusement, tears, drama, romance, and sex and did not bother about morality or “good taste” (Itasaki, 1975; Lehmann, 1982; Seidensticker, 1983; Pons, 1988; Yokoi, 1975). Only since the Meiji era (1868–1912) have the governing elites forced the values and aesthetics of aristocratic and warrior’s high culture upon the whole society and suppressed the popular ones (Gluck, 1985; Pons, 1988) — which, of course, remained alive and well underneath the “politically correct” layer of ikebana, tea ceremonies, and stone gardens. This process of forcing an elitism upon national culture during the contemporary period, and the ensuing mix of high and popular cultures, seem to be rather peculiar to Japan. Manga is a by-product of this phenomenon — as a genre where the most gifted samurai hero can fart, burp, get drunk, and cry — that gives to many series an unmistakable and very attractive “politically incorrect” ﬂavor. When looking for the origins of manga, most authors (among others Groensteen 1991; Schodt 1983) mention the painted narrative scrolls\n\n18\n\nMANGA\n\n(e-makimono), especially the four Chô-jûgiga (the Animal Scrolls, twelfth century) by the abbot Toba Sôjô (1053–1140),1 kept in the Kôzanji shrine near Kyoto. This satirical black and white piece of work portrays aristocrats, priests, and warriors under the guise of rabbits, frogs, monkeys, and other not-so-digniﬁed animals. One may wonder why the much older Eingakyô, an anonymous full-color scroll from the Nara period (710–794), which narrates the life of Buddha using a mix of images and text (underneath) — whereas the Chô-jûgiga have no text — is never mentioned. Some manga scholars warn against the temptation to link present-day manga to the e-makimono, and Neil Cohn points out that “the dialect of the Japanese Visual Language hardly resembles . . . the graphic system depicted in e-maki” (2007, 12). Although of interest for specialists, this debate about ﬁliation misses two very signiﬁcant points. The ﬁrst point is the content, since many themes of the scrolls imagery have also found their way into contemporary manga. Often mentioned in this regard is the Scroll of the Hungry Ghosts (Gaki Zôshi, twelfth century), in which the desperate spirits feed on, among other things, human excrement, and other scrolls depicting farting or penis-size contests, one of which is attributed to the abbot Toba himself. In the same vein are contemporary manga that particularly disgusted the Western “Japan lovers,” like Toiretto Hakase (Professor Toilet) or the (in)famous ﬁrst martial arts tournament in Dragon Ball, in which one of the heroes confronts an opponent who uses farts and stinky genitals as chemical weapons.2 Also of interest are Hyakki Yôkai (The Night Walk of One Thousand Demons, ﬁfteenth century), and countless sketches and drawings depicting yôkai (supernatural monsters). These works passed on many oddly-looking but good-natured devilish beings to manga series like Okano Reiko’s Onmyôji (exorcist) or Mizuki Shigeru’s NonNonBa (Grandma NonNon), and, more generally, testify to a tradition of familiarity between human and nonhuman beings that lies at the core of manga universes and imaginaries, whereas this mix, although not totally unknown, is less common in the French “bande dessinée” (BD) and American comics.3 The second point is the technique. The narrative scrolls — devoid of balloons and frames, but mixing text and drawing as soon as the eighth century — are the ﬁrst pillar of a rich tradition of graphic narration in Japan. Many ancient cultures outside of Japan also knew graphic narration under various forms: the Egyptians had frescoes, the Aztecs had codices, and the French had the Bayeux Tapestry (eleventh century) which mixed text and drawing more intimately than the Japanese scrolls did (McCloud 1993). Thus, from a theoretical point of view, if one considers only the graphic system, there is no reason to argue that the e-makimono are more the “ancestors” of manga than the Aztec codices or the Bayeux Tapestry are those of Mafalda\n\nMANGA\n\n19\n\nor Tintin. But from a historical point of view, the tradition of graphic narration collapsed in Egypt and South America — if not in France — whereas the e-makimono remained alive until the Edo period (1603–1867), and was succeeded by other media mixing text and image. This continuity made the Japanese culture familiar with graphic narration, a fact that certainly contributed to the blossoming and social acceptance of manga. Many scholars also relate this “familiarity” to the use of ideograms (Cohn 2007). This debate goes beyond the scope of this chapter. Suﬃce it to say that even if there is no “linear” relation between e-makimono and manga as far as graphical and narrative techniques are concerned, there is a long tradition of graphic narration in both high and popular Japanese culture. In addition to e-makimono, manga can be related to other forms of Japanese graphic art. The Zen painting (zenga), which debuted in the fourteenth century and blossomed during the ﬁrst part of the Edo period, often mixes calligraphy and drawing. Zen masters, as a way toward enlightenment, use absurd enigmas to confront their disciples to the inanity of rational thought. In the same vein, the zenga oﬀers many nonsensical pieces of work — a man defecating in a ﬁeld, looking inside the anus of a horse, or having his buttock burnt by an old woman, with the accompaniment of enigmatic sayings. This tradition reemerged in two genres that ﬂourish in manga whereas BD and comics almost ignore them (with a few underground exceptions like George Herriman’s Krazy Kat) — the gag manga and the yaoi genre,4 like Yamagami Tatsuhiko’s Gakideka, Ueda Hajime’s FuliCuli, or Sawai Yoshio’s Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo. This is not to say that Yamagami and Ueda are the direct heirs of the Zen monks; the relationship between manga and the past graphic arts is more complex than that. Manga owes much to the urban culture of the Edo period — although, here again, some specialists, such as Tomofusa Kure, see “no more relation between it and the manga than between abacus and computer” (Kure, 1997, II-2; author’s translation). After two centuries of bloody anarchy, peace was restored by the authoritarian regime of the Tokugawa shoguns. Big cities ﬂourished and the popular culture of the merchant class and townspeople thrived, introducing woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), Kabuki theater, popular illustrated novels and ﬂamboyant “pleasure quarters” like Yoshiwara in Edo (now Tokyo). Manga owes something to each of these older forms of entertainment (Koyama-Richard 2007). Because of the technical limitations of woodblock printing and the constraints of mass production, the ukiyo-e basically remains the same, without shadows or realistic perspective, not so diﬀerent from Hergé’s ligne claire (clear line)5. The anatomy of characters is simplistic. The faces are typically ovals devoid of realistic features, like white canvas on which only eyes and mouth, albeit minuscule, convey the emotions through expression\n\n20\n\nMANGA\n\nexaggerated to the point of caricature — something quite familiar to manga readers, especially shônen and shôjo manga fans. Kabuki is no more realistic than woodblock prints. The actors don’t mimic the sentiments, but “write them” on their faces using heavy makeup and quasi-cartoonish codes — rolling eyes, contorted mouth, tensed faces, and grimaces. They often move with an unrealistic but extremely expressive slowness, and sometimes stop as if frozen. Manga, especially its shônen and shôjo genres, reuses these techniques, which shocked Western educationalists. For example, the ﬁrst attempts at translating Nakazawa Keiji’s Hadashi no Gen failed miserably in both the United States and France during the 1980s, although its denunciations of war and the atomic bomb were very “politically correct” at that time. Part of the reason for this failure is that the clownish mimics of Gen seemed completely out of touch with the dramatic topic of the atomic bomb. Gigantic screaming or laughing mouths, tears bursting out like geysers, and arms or legs wrapping round the body to express utmost embarrassment looked out of place, even somewhat obscene in the context of nuclear holocaust. Kabuki has many features in common with the popular French Grand Guignol of the nineteenth century. Most plays last for hours, sometimes a full day, and the plot is rich in cock-and-bull developments. Drama, violence, and blood are shown on the stage, and many characters die prolonged brutal and gruesome deaths. Plots are inspired by history, but also by dramatic news items from urban life — especially the double suicides (shinjû) that resulted from the prohibition of marriage between people of diﬀerent castes. Edo townspeople also loved the plot spiced with a dose of supernatural and vengeful disﬁgured ghosts. Once again, manga feeds on this tradition, with its endless stories and multiple interweaving plots, and high dramatic intensity even in pieces for children — for example, the numerous violent deaths in Tezuka Osamu’s Tetsuwan Atomu (Mighty Atom or Astroboy) or in Dragon Ball. The news items and daily life of Edo were also the raw materials for kibyôshi. These illustrated, cheap “yellow-backed” or “blue-backed” novels, of which more than three thousand titles were published from 1775 until the end of the Edo period, could sell up to ten thousand copies each. Plots mixed drama, sex, fantasy, romance, and humor and were spiced with as much irreverence toward the powers that be as was tolerated by the authoritarian Tokugawa regime. As for the technique, kibyôshi interwove text and images, whereas at that time, Western illustrated books placed the text either beside or under the pictures. Some of the books also featured the ﬁrst text “balloons” on a few pages. Furthermore, as early as the eighteenth century, the mass production for a popular audience of illustrated books featuring drawing on almost every page and often more drawing than text was nowhere to be found to the same degree in the West at that time.\n\nMANGA\n\n21\n\nThe “ﬂoating world” (ukiyo) of the pleasure quarters furnished plenty of raw material to Kabuki, illustrated popular novels, and woodblock prints. For courtesans and their customers, the masters of ukiyo-e produced shunga (“spring images”), whose unbridled pornography attest that Japanese culture was much less inhibited than Western culture was as far as the multiple avatars of sexuality were concerned. Scatology, bestiality, and sadism were part of the game. This open-minded attitude toward sex is rooted in the Shintô culture (Bornoﬀ 1992; Lesoualc’h 1968). Contemporary manga also takes the subject of sexuality without taboo, whereas the Western comics industry seems to ignore that sexuality is a major concern for teenagers — and grown-ups as well. Shunga also had a pedagogical function, which manga perpetuates through series like Aki Katsu’s Futari H — translated in France and elsewhere as Step Up Love Story — probably the most enjoyable sexuality “textbook” presently on the world market. As seen through the eyes of a historian rather than a theoretician of the art of comics, the debate about “the origins of manga” seems rather futile. Rather than use sophisticated conceptual tools in order to either prove or deny ﬁliation between the Chô-jûgiga and GTO or between the Bayeux Tapestry and Asterix, suﬃce to say that multiple links can be found that relate the contemporary manga to past forms of graphic narration and art: recurrent themes rooted in Japan’s cultural background, borrowed techniques, and — above all — a more continuous and richer tradition of graphic narration than in the West. Manga also owes much to the second encounter of Japan with the West. Years after the warships of U.S. commodore Matthew Perry forcibly entered Uraga Bay in 1853 and forced the Tokugawa to reopen the archipelago to foreigners, during the Meiji era (1868–1912) the rich tradition of Japanese graphic narration was to meet the Western one, and this encounter gave birth to what has been named — for the ﬁrst time — manga.\n\nTHE ENCOUNTER WITH THE WEST AND THE BIRTH OF (WHAT WAS NOT QUITE YET) MANGA The West introduced the technology — oﬀset and lithography printing — that permitted the transformation of the graphic narration into a new type of low-cost mass media, and some Westerners provided the model for such a new media. In that respect, Briton Charles Wirgman and Frenchman Georges Bigot are often mentioned (Schodt 1983, 38). By launching illustrated magazines for Western expatriates — Japan Punch (1862) and Tôbaé (1887) — they introduced in Japan the Western-style satirical drawing, which soon came to be named ponchi-e or tôba-e. Two diﬀerent kinds of Japanese illustrated magazines soon developed. On the one hand, nishiki-e\n\n22\n\nMANGA\n\nshimbun (colored woodblock-print news sheets) rejuvenated the Edo period’s kibyôshi genre in the form of tabloidlike magazines ﬁlled with illustrated stories of gruesome murders and vengeful ghosts; the most famous was the Tokyo-based Nichinichi Shinbun. On the other hand, satirical magazines in the vein of Punch, with strong political overtones, directed jibes at the authorities and establishment, and were harassed by censorship like the Marumaru Chimbun,7 founded in 1877 by Nomura Fumio (1836–1998), a reformist expelled from the civil service who became a founding member of the progressive Kaishintô Party in 1882. These magazines — both the political and the popular ones — employed illustrators who came from the ukiyo-e industry and used brushes and black ink for drawing. In the middle of the 1890s, American newspapers started weekly supplements featuring cartoons using balloons and frames, which soon came to be copied in Japan. The archipelago was experiencing a period of political change, rapid industrialization and social turmoil. The whole country braced itself to modernize. Democratic-minded reformists confronted the authoritarian conservative mainstream as the ﬁrst national election was held in 1889, followed by years of tumultuous confrontation between the reformist parties, which had a majority in the lower house of the Diet, and the imperial government. In 1897, the Marumaru Chimbun published a series suggesting that the newspaper’s political cartoons had been inﬂuential in the victory of the presidential candidate William McKinley in the U.S. election the preceding year. In 1900, the leading reformist Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835–1901) added to his newspaper Jiji Shinpô a weekly supplement titled Jiji Manga. It was the ﬁrst appearance of the word manga in the title of a publication. Reformists deemed both tôba-e and ponchi-e inappropriate terms for naming the new illustrated medium, because of ancientness or foreign origin. A lively debate ensued, lasting until the beginning of the Taisho period (1912–1923), with the reformists pushing manga as replacement (Asian Manga Summit 2002, 13). Although ukiyo-e master Hokusai Katsushika (1760–1849) is commonly credited for inventing this term in 1814, the world had been in use since the end of the eighteenth century.8 Manga means “sketches made for fun or out of a sudden inspiration,” and is often translated as “derisory pictures”; however, the connotation of “free” was probably as important as “derisory” for the journalists of the Jiji Shimpô, exposed to censorship as they were. It was in the Jiji Manga that the ﬁrst weekly comic strips appeared. Illustrator Kitazawa Rakuten (a pen name for Kitazawa Yasuji, 1876–1955) created Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo kenbutsu (Tagosaku and Mokube Sightseeing in Tokyo), a six-frame series about two country bumpkins who discover the modern world, running water, and gas lamps. Three years later, Kitazawa launched the full-color satirical monthly Tokyo Puck (1905–15),\n\nMANGA\n\n23\n\nwhere many mangaka (manga artists) earned their spurs. Perhaps the ﬁrst star mangaka, Kitazawa was awarded the Légion d’Honneur by the French government. He is the ﬁrst mangaka to whom a museum — the Saitama City Manga Museum — has been dedicated. During the Taisho era (1912–26), manga was already recognized as a genre worthy of learned criticism and academic analysis, as shown by the publication in 1924 of Hosokibara Seiki’s Nihon manga-shi, the ﬁrst history of the genre (Asian Manga Summit 2002, 13). Besides the daily newspapers, sophisticated cultural and news magazines like Asahi Gurafu (1923–2000) published manga side by side with pictures, illustrations, and reporting. As the labor movement and political Left strengthened in the wake of rapid industrialization, manga was still used as a tool for political expression by Kitazawa, Okamoto Ippei (1886–1948); the star mangaka of the famous daily Asahi, and the members of the League of Proletarian Mangaka (Nihon Mangaka Renmei) who drew nômin manga (people’s manga) and rôdô manga (workers’ manga). At the same time, manga developed as mass entertainment. Magazines for youngsters — sometimes of two hundred pages or more — published literary texts, reporting, and manga series, the most popular of which were published afterward in paperback book form. Unlike France and the United States, where BD and comics were mostly the domain of small or middle-sized specialized publishers, the large mainstream Japanese publishing powerhouses entered the manga business from the beginning. The largest one, Kodansha, launched the manga magazine for teenage boys, Shônen Kurabu, in 1914, and then Shôjo Kurabu (1923) for teenage girls and Yônen Kurabu for younger children (1926). In eﬀect, mainstream Japanese publishers turned manga into a mass industry. In 1931, according to Schodt (1983, 51, 49), Kodansha printed as many as 950,000 copies of Yônen Kurabu; it also reissued more than 100 paperback versions of Dango Kushisuke man’yuki (The Travels of Dango Kushisuke), a samurai series by Miyao Shigeo, between 1924 and 1934. After World War II this industry support would become key to the proﬁtability and worldwide expansion of manga and manga by-products. Successful manga series soon morphed into movies and radio serials — for example, the Japanese remake of George McManus’s Bringing Up Father — and numerous marketing items were made from popular characters like the black dog Norakuro, the hero of the eponymous series drawn by Tagawa Suihô. Japanese mangaka largely drew their inspiration from American comics and cartoons, and the graphics were overwhelmingly Disneylike. However, mangaka developed original themes and characters that were to reappear and prosper in postwar manga: young samurais endowed with supernatural powers (Dango Kushisuke man’yuki), children battling international conspiracies (Supîdî Tarô [Speedy Tarô], by Sakô Shishido 1930) or traveling\n\n24\n\nMANGA\n\nthrough outer space (Kasei tanken [Voyage to Mars], by Ôshiro Noboru and Asahi Tarô 1940). The overarching themes of these manga somewhat reﬂected Japan’s eﬀorts, as a newcomer not quite accepted by the Western powers, to locate itself within the international world order at that time. Another speciﬁc Japanese genre that ﬂourished in the rather liberal context of the Taisho era is the ero-guro-nansensu. This “erotic-grotesque nonsense” was a distant heir of absurd zenga painting, shunga, and the ghostsand-blood Kabuki tradition melded to Western imports such as surrealism, fantasy literature (à la Edgar Allan Poe) and German sexology books like Richard von Kraﬀt-Ebing’s Psychopathia Sexualis (1886). In the 1920s, no fewer than ten journals focused upon “perverse” sexuality (McLelland 2006), and the public interest in the genre was further aroused by the famous Abe Sada “murder plus penis-cutting” case in 1936.9 After the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi Ôsachi (1930) and the invasion of Manchuria (1931) came a militarist regime, renewed censorship, and ﬁfteen years of war. Manga was enlisted in the war eﬀort. In Shônen Kurabu, Norakuro the dog, a not-so-exemplary soldier when he debuted in 1931, now bravely routed the Chinese (depicted as cowardly pigs), and spawned imitations like the faithful dog Hachikô.10 Between 1933 and 1939, the young hero of Bôken Dankichi (Dankichi the Adventurer), a series by Shimada Keizô in Shônen Kurabu, won the hearts and minds of the natives of a Paciﬁc Island, converted them to Shintô, and taught them how to battle victoriously the white foreigners who tried to subjugate them. The various mangakas’ associations were fused together into an oﬃcial one whose monthly publication Manga was the only one to continue during the war despite the scarcity of paper (Schodt 1983, 55–56). In summary, prewar Japan appropriated the imported art of comics and melded it with its own culture’s diversiﬁed tradition of graphic narration. This marriage enlisted the new phenomenon of manga as both a media for political and social debate and a mass market for teenage entertainment organized by mainstream publishers. However, prewar Japanese comics were still a far cry from the art that was to become known worldwide as manga and that now ﬂoods the global market for imaginary universes. For such a transformation to happen, it took the conjunction of the enduring national trauma suﬀered by the Japanese collective consciousness as a result of its defeat in the war, seven years of U.S. occupation of Japan, and an increasingly sophisticated marketing eﬀort by the publishing industry.\n\nTHE LEGACY OF WAR AND DEFEAT What the world now knows as manga — and the Japanese know as kindai manga (modern manga) — ﬁrst appeared in April 1947, with the publication\n\nMANGA\n\n25\n\nof Shin takarajima (The New Treasure Island), by Tezuka Osamu (1921–89), which reportedly sold 400,000 copies in a few months.11 Nicknamed “the God of Manga,” Tezuka was subsequently credited with the chief innovations that have made contemporary manga what it is — notably, graphic techniques in imitation of cinema and “story manga” with long, complex plot lines. Many of the ﬁrst generation of mangaka, Tezuka included, had been teenagers during the war. Too young to ﬁght, they were nevertheless mature enough to feel the trauma of defeat very deeply. This trauma brought manga four elements that gave it a complexity and dramatic intensity unlike anything found in American and Franco-Belgian comics. The ﬁrst was an underlying scenario involving adult failure, the destruction of the world, and the survival of a group of young people bound together by friendship and optimism, which recurs in countless series into the twenty-ﬁrst century. The second was the mecha genre, in which combat robots piloted by teenagers save Japan (or the world) from attack by another race — a clear illustration of the frustration felt by sons who dreamed of winning a war lost by their fathers. The third was the kagaku bôken (scientiﬁc adventure) genre, reﬂecting the almost sacred status accorded to science in the immediate postwar period by the Japanese, whom it had brought to its knees. The fourth was the fruit of the enforcement of new ideals imported by U.S. occupation (freedom, democracy) upon a nation whose traditional values had failed but not disappeared. This uneasy juxtaposition resulted in a combination of regrets, protest, and a passion for progress, which inspired the mangaka — as well as writers like Tanizaki Junichirô and Mishima Yukio — to oﬀer far more complex lessons in life than those available to American and French comics readers, as well as a more dramatic tone. Such complexity lies at the heart of Tezuka’s famous Tetsuwan Atomu (translated either as Mighty Atom or Astroboy) series, started in 1951 and arguably the best-selling and best-known manga in history;12 although Tetsuwan Atomu is intended for children under age twelve, many people die brutal deaths as the young robot-hero battles for tolerance, democracy, the peaceful use of science, and against racism — while oﬀering a rather bleak picture of the United States to its young Japanese audience. Not every artistic genre has the “luck” to rise out of the ﬁres of the atomic bomb and the painful birth of a new society. In the postwar period manga took two main forms. On the one hand were the series for children, published by major Tokyo publishers in monthly magazines, whose very short episodes still displayed an unmistakable Disneylike style. On the other were the cheap “red books” (akabon) from small publishers largely located in the Osaka area. Intended mostly for adult readers,13 these books were primarily distributed by rental libraries — there were as many as 5,000 of them in the early 1960s — but were also sold in general stores and peddled aboard trains and boats (Nagano 2004, II-2). The akabon\n\n26\n\nMANGA\n\ndealt with social dramas and the most inadmissible and shameful human passions, including incest and necrophilia, in the tradition of the illustrated popular novels of Edo. In tune with the spirit of the times, happy endings were exceptional, the graphic style was dark and the tone “hard” (dogitsui). In 1957 the term gekiga (dramatic images) was coined for this genre. Also worth mentioning is the kamishibai (“paper theater”), a street performance in which a storyteller entertained the audience using a set of illustrated boards to accompany the narration. In the second half of the 1940s, up to 10,000 storytellers earned their living in that way, and some future stars of the manga world — including the jidai mono (historical manga) master Shirato Sampei and the horror master Mizuki Shigeru, whose famous character Gegege no Kitarô was ﬁrst created for the paper theater — started their career by drawing boards for kamishibai. Manga succeeded because of its combination of gekiga and series for children. Manga matured alongside a baby boom audience who thus developed a lifelong dedication to the format. As boomers near retirement today, they continue to patronize the manga of their youth and wait the advent of “silver manga” to brighten up their senior years.\n\nFROM SCHOOLBOY SERIES TO A NATION OF MANGA READERS: 1959–90 In 1959, the ﬁrst baby boomers reached age twelve and moved to high school — an age at which Japanese parents felt that children should stop reading manga. Publishers successfully challenged this expectation by launching the ﬁrst weekly magazines — Shônen Magazine (Kodansha) and Shônen Sunday (Shogakukan), and Japanese teenagers now had enough pocket money to buy their own magazines and defy parental wishes. The slackening parental control opened the door to series whose young heroes’ escapades aroused the (vain) fury of teachers against “vulgar manga” (geihin na manga; Nagano 2004, I-5). In this same period, prosperity and television led readers of gekiga away from the rental libraries, most of which thus folded. When the baby boomers entered university their passage to adulthood proved tempestuous. The student movement that began in 1968 was longlasting and brutal, and manga mirrored its readership’s rebellious spirit. The major magazines hired comics artists from the gekiga, supplanting those who had cut their teeth on schoolchildren’s series, with the notable exception of Tezuka, who successfully developed dramatic and historical series and some that dealt with sex. These iconoclasts broke taboo after taboo. For example, Nagai Gô, creator of Grendizer,14 who, from 1968 to 1972, had enormous success with his “indecent school” (Harenchi gakuen). In Nagai’s high school the main occupation of the boys and teachers — when they aren’t boozing,\n\nMANGA\n\n27\n\ndefecating in the corridors, or exposing themselves — is lifting the skirts of the girls, some of whom seldom complain. The series, included by major publisher Shueisha in its ﬂagship weekly Shônen Jump, ignored protests from outraged parents and teachers’ associations until Nagai ﬁnished it with an attack on the school mounted by the parents that culminated in a general massacre. The rebelling students also loved series like Hikarukaze (1970), by Yamagami Tatsuhiko, which denounces a possible comeback of the militarism, and Ashita no Jô, by Chiba Tetsuya, the story of a reformatory school escapee who breaks free from the oppression of society to become a world boxing champion. Around the same time, manga was consolidating its readership of grown-up girls, whom the American and French comics industry had never managed to engage. At the very beginning of the 1970s, shôjo manga (girls’ manga), largely the provenance of male cartoonists, was taken over by the Hana 24-nen gumi, a generation of women comic artists in their early twenties. They invented a completely new aesthetics for the genre, oﬀered a feminine vision of love and sex and dealt with problems such as pregnancy and rape. In macho Japanese society, teenage girls were unable to ﬁgure themselves out in a love relationship with a boy on an equal footing. To dissipate the anxiety of their readers and permit them to identify with the characters, the female cartoonists used tricks that remain today a distinctive trademark of manga: the transvestite heroine — like Oscar in the famous Berusaru no bara by Ikeda Riyoko — and the so-called shônen-ai genre of love stories among pretty, eﬀeminate young boys (bishônen), whose best ﬁrst examples are Juichigatsu no gimunajiumu (A High School in November; 1971) and Tôma no Shinzô (The Heart of Thomas; 1974) by Hagio Moto, and Takemiya Keiko’s Kaze to ki no uta (The Songs of Trees and Winds; 1976). Having successfully accompanied the baby boomers, both male and female, through their coming of age, the manga industry further pursued the market segmentation by age group. It created seinen manga (young men’s manga), which combines love and sex with social problems of contemporary relevance. The period around 1975, when the baby boomers were settling down, saw the arrival of “salaryman manga” and “oﬃce ladies’ manga,” featuring plots set in the business world. The most famous character of salaryman manga — the young buchô (section chief ) Shima Kôsaku, born in 1983 and working in a commercial company in Hirokane Kenshi’s Kachô Shima Kôsaku series — had a career parallel to that of its most successful readers and was still doing well in 2007 as senmu (vice president or senior executive director). As for women, since the “oﬃce ladies” married and became thirty-something mothers and housewives in the early 1980s, their manga oﬀered series of an often risqué nature building upon the shônen-ai genre of their shôjo time. These were not the only manga genres, and publishers continued to\n\n28\n\nMANGA\n\nincrease the variety of genre manga, including series dealing with sports or martial arts, a proliferation of science ﬁction manga and mecha, historical series (jidai mono), hard-boiled and detective stories, manga dealing with social problems (shakai manga), fantasy, horror, gag manga, gurume manga (gourmet manga; series on cooking), and series about any conceivable hobbies (from mah-jong to ﬁshing, golf, and pachinko),15 not to mention a large output of pornography to suit every possible taste.\n\nMASS MEDIA, MASS INDUSTRY, AND OFFICIAL RECOGNITION The start of manga’s proﬁtable association with television came in 1963 with the launch of the series based on Tezuka’s Tetsuwan Atomu and sponsored by major chocolate makers Meiji. Since then, in association with a broad range of sponsors that soon encompassed much more than toys and the food-and-drink industry, publishers have continued to develop the art of the media mix, with weekly comics, the reissue of successful series in paperback volumes, TV and OVA series,16 animated ﬁlms, live action ﬁlms, music (from TV shows and movies) and musicals, advertising featuring popular characters, and merchandising products by the thousands. Since the 1990s, the mix also includes video games, short stories or novels, and even fashion magazines like Nana, which takes as its title the name of the principal characters from Yazawa Aï’s very successful manga series of the same name. This multiplicity of media has enabled manga to create imaginary worlds that are rich enough to oﬀer a refuge to many young people feeling alienated from society. The culture of the so-called otaku developed among the post–baby boom generation17 — a culture that, discouraged from protest by the failure of its elders in 1968, has instead opted for mild escape from society. In the 1980s, the high level of aﬄuence attained in Japanese society permitted the otaku to pursue this way of life, and in the 1990s the advent of Internet technology enabled them to build communities via the World Wide Web. The combination of maturation strategy, market segmentation, and media mix has turned manga into a mass industry with no equivalent in the world. In 1967, manga magazines numbered less than 50 and sold about 78 million copies; at their height in 1994, they numbered 260 and sold 1,890 million copies, plus around 700 million softcover books, for a sales ﬁgure of about ¥520 billion (Nagano, 2003).18 Although the volume of production has diminished by more than 33% since 1995 — down to 1,260 millions in 2006 [JETRO, 2008] — due to combination of demographics, economic crisis, and social and cultural changes — the Japanese manga industry still produces 10 copies of magazines and books per year for every Japanese, as opposed to\n\nMANGA\n\n29\n\nfewer than 40 million copies for French comics and 110 million for American comics (one for three Americans). More than 100 million copies of some manga series have been sold and, at its height in 1995, Shônen Jump, the topselling weekly for teenagers, had a circulation of 6 million and was read by about 20 percent of the population (Stumpf, 2003). An important change in the social status and impact of manga occurred in 1986, when the major business daily Nihon Keizai commissioned mangaka Ishinomori Shotarô to create Manga Nihon Keizai nyûmon (Japan Inc: Introduction to Japanese Economy). In 1989 Chûô Kôron, ﬂagship publisher of the Japanese intelligentsia, commissioned Shotarô and a team of ﬁfty academics to create a history of Japan (Manga Nihon no rekishi) approved by the Ministry of Education for use in the schools. Since then manga has become a fully-ﬂedged communication medium used by authorities, business, politicians, and even the European Community delegation in Tokyo. During the 1990s, some series touching political or social subjects — among them Black Jack ni yoroshiku (Say Hello to Black Jack) by Satô Syuho, Zipang by Kawaguchi Kaiji and the whole work of the provocative revisionist cartoonist Kobayashi Yoshinori — sparked national, and even international, debates. Manga owes its inﬂuence to its ability to keep pace with new developments in society and attitudes, as illustrated by three changes in the genres inherited from the defeat and nuclear traumas: the post-apocalyptic, the mecha and the so-called “scientiﬁc adventure”. From the 1970s to the end of the twentieth century, the original postapocalyptic scenario moved from the unshakable optimism of Nakazawa’s Hadashi no Gen (1972) to complete uncertainty about the future in Ôtomo Katsuhiro’s Akira (1984–93). From Grendizer (1975) to Neon Genesis Evangelion (1994), mecha’s simplistic clashes between big machines gave way to an exploration of the existentialist worries of their young controllers, including girls, who now have leading roles — just as they do in Akira. Since the 1990s the bright scientiﬁc future of which Tezuka once dreamed has turned dark, with gods and/or nature cruelly punishing humankind for polluting the earth (Hokazono Masaya’s Inugami; 1996–2002), deviant genetic manipulations (Sôryo Fuyumi’s Eternal Sabbath; 2001–4) and deadly viruses manufactured by evil organizations (Urasawa Naoki’s 20th Century Boys; 1999–2006), while the passion for tolerance has sometimes been replaced by strident neonationalism in the work of successful authors like Kobayashi Yoshinori. Now, near the end of the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century, Japan has become the world’s second largest exporter of cultural products. The media mixes that manga is a part of are among the “content industries” that have oﬃcially become a pillar of the restructured Japanese economy since the crisis of the 1990s. They generate ever-expanding sales ﬁgures: since its debut in 1996, Pokemon has earned more than US$152 billion, and the total exports\n\n30\n\nMANGA\n\nof “J-Pop” goods reached 1,500 trillion yen in 2002 alone (Sugiura 2003). The otaku generation, whose rejection of a society felt to be too constraining has been embraced by most Japanese during the 1990s, have found their place within the nation. Tezuka has been elevated to the rank of national treasure, and manga is taught in many universities. Yet, since the middle of the 1990s, the manga industry has been having some problems. The circulation of magazines — but not the sales of tankôbon — steadily declines because of a shrinking base of new readers resulting from a declining birth rate, the competition from video games in the young cohort of readers, and the diﬃculty of retaining the interest of aging baby boomers. Because of this phenomenon, some experts prophesize “the death of the magazines” and their replacement by digital manga diﬀused on mobile phones and computers. However, manga remains a crucial component of popular culture in present-day Japan, and there is no doubt that the mammoth publishers that turned Japanese comics into a mass product with worldwide appeal will be able to adapt to the new trends of the market.\n\nNotes 1. In this chapter, Japanese peoples’ names are presented in the traditional Japanese way — that is, surname ﬁrst. 2. Toiretto Hakase is a series by Torii Kazuo, started in 1970; its main character is a “philosopher” whose preferred topic for meditation is human excrement (Schodt 1993, 122). 3. Most noticeable in France is the work of Tardi, especially Rumeurs sur le Rouergue and the Adèle Blanc Sec series. 4. Yaoi is short for yama nashi ochi nashi imi nashi (no climax, no plot, no sense), but today’s fans use it mostly to refer to love stories between boys. 5. Hergé is the pen name of Georges Remi (1907–83), author of the Tintin series. 6. Marumaru Chimbun’s name alludes to the “circles” (maru) that the censors used to mark the part to be deleted. 7. Suzuki Kankei, in Mankaku zuihitsu (1771); Santô Kyôden, a kibyôshi writer and illustrator, in Shiji no yukikai (1798); and Aikawa Minwa, in Manga hyaku onna (1814), all predated Hokusai, according to Wikipedia (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Manga). 8. Sada Abe (1905–87) erotically asphyxiated her lover Ishida Kichizo, then cut oﬀ his genitals and carried them around in her handbag until she was arrested two days later. This case became a national sensation and was given mythic overtones in many subsequent books and movies. 9. Chûken Hachikô (The Faithful Dog Hachikô), by Ôshiro Noboru and others (see Akiyama 1998). 10. This commonly found assertion can be doubted, especially if one considers the rarity — and ensuing exorbitant price — of the surviving copies. 11. See the “Manga les plus célèbres (Most Cited Manga) section at Manga Network (France), http://www.ceri-sciences-po.org/themes/manga/index.php. 12. However, Tezuka’s Shin takarajima and many of his earlier works for children appeared in this form because Tezuka lived near Osaka. 13. The character is also known as Goldorak (in France) or Goldrake (in Italy). During the 1970s this character was hugely successful in Europe as an TV animated series.\n\nMANGA\n\n14. 15. 16. 17.\n\n31\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, those who had watched these series as children became the ﬁrst generation of Western manga fans. For a nearly complete review of the genres, see Schodt 1983. OVA (original animation video) are series made to be released on home video formats, and not intended for showing on TV or theaters. Otaku (“your home,” meaning “you”) is the most possibly neutral way — devoid of hierarchical connotation — of addressing other people. It started to be used mainly among hardcore sci-ﬁ animation fans around the mid-1970s. This was equivalent to about $US5.5 billion at that time.\n\nReferences Akiyama Masami, ed. (1998).

The genre headings used in this chapter are by no means a comprehensive listing of the staggering array that is published in any year in Japan or republished as translations elsewhere. The listings used here reﬂect both the ﬁltering of manga through the availability of English translations as well as the accretion of attention that particular genres have garnered through English-language scholarship. In a more direct sense, then, the overview provided here seeks to foreground the depth of genre hybridity — how elements or characteristics particular to one genre are often recombined with others as creative reworkings that drive readership appeal as well as plot and character development. Moreover, we have also included examples of mangaka, or manga artists who have worked in diﬀerent genres. There is, of course, the overarching imperative to map manga cursorily introduced here against the readership categories that now inform Western popular media accounts of the phenomenal publishing success of translated works as well as coverage of the online communities consuming and circulating manga in electronic formats, such as “scanlations.” The headings used in this chapter therefore seek to mention a series within a genre that are shōjo or shōnen in their orientation — that is, targeting female or male teenagers as their core readership. There are also josei subgenres targeting young adult women as well as seinen works that strongly appeal to young adult males. Other genres were selected for their ability to showcase the variety in use of layout and publishing formats. Where possible we have indicated the year when an individual series\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF MANGA GENRES\n\n35\n\ncommenced and ended publication in Japan in manga magazines, and as a quick pointer to how devoted the following of a series can become by virtue of its longevity, we have indicated such a series as ongoing via the use of an open-ended dash: –. To indicate the availability of English translations of a manga series, the italicized English title has been used and a second date has been provided, while manga titles that are not translated have been indicated with an asterisk (*).\n\nFANTASY, THE MYTHOLOGICAL, AND THE SURREALISM OF THE EVERYDAY The salient feature characterizing fantasy and legend manga are the rich milieus they (re-)create through adaptations of mythological, folkloric, and literary sources. Chinese legends and settings are recurring textual sources, such as the ancient Chinese literary legend of the Buddhist pilgrimage Saiyūki (Journey to the West), also known as The Adventures of the Monkey God. Character-based retellings of this legend, such as Katsuya Terada’s The Monkey King (1995–/2005–), Kazuya Minekura’s Saiyūki (1997–2002/2004–5) series and Akira Toriyama’s immensely popular quest series Dragon Ball (1984– 95/1998–2004) are as diverse in their interpretations as the visual techniques used to illustrate them. Ancient Greek myths have also been the basis for a single manga series such as Yoshikazu Yasuhiko’s Arion (1979–85*), while individual Greek gods such as Athena and Deimos appear in contemporary settings, as in Koge-Tonbo’s Kamichama Karin (2002–5/2005–7) and Etsuko Ikeda and Yūho Ashibe’s Bride of Deimos (1975–83/2002–4). Norse deities also feature as central characters, as in Sakura Kinoshita’s The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnorak (2002–5/2004–5) and Kōsuke Fujishima’s Oh My Goddess! (1988–/1994–), the latter having the Norse goddess Belldandy living with a techno-geek student. Wakako Mizuki’s Itihāsa (1986–97*) envisions an ancient Japan inhabited by a pantheon of deities locked in a cosmological struggle over good and evil, with humans in between. The fantasy genre also evidences the envelopment of the reader in worlds of strikingly imaginative originality. Hiroshi Masumura’s Atagooru Tamatebako (1984–94*) depicts an alternative fairy-tale reality whose denizens are cats sharing a language with humans, a linguistic feature Masumura enhanced by creating his own dialect for the characters to speak. Fantasy manga can also combine elements of quest-based adventure with magical or mythical sources, with very strong shōjo or shōnen and seinen orientations. The shōjo manga by the group of authors known as CLAMP epitomize such genre hybridity, with series, such as RG Veda (1989–96/2005–6), which draws on Hindu mythology; Cardcaptor Sakura (1996–2000/1999–2003), a retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale; and\n\n36\n\nMANGA\n\nthe sword-and-sorcery kingdom of Magic Knight Rayearth (1993–96/1999– 2001). Similarly, Yū Watase’s Ceres: Celestial Legend (1996–2000/2001–6) and Reiko Shimizu’s Kaguya-hime (1994–2005) oﬀer richly detailed portrayals of contemporary Japan combined with folkloric narratives involving celestial maidens. Japanese fairy tales, or dōwa, have also been adapted for shōjo manga, as in CLAMP’s 1992 treatment of the Snow Goddess (Shirahime-Syo: Snow Goddess Tales, 1992/2004), while Junko Mizuno gives European fairy tales Gothic and creepily cute reworkings for the twenty-ﬁrst century (Junko Mizuno’s Cinderalla [sic], 2000/2002; Hansel and Gretel, 2000/2003; and Princess Mermaid, 2002/2004). Shōjo series featuring girls or women gifted with magical abilities who undergo personae transformation as central characters are now a genre by themselves (“magical girls’ manga,” or mahō shōjo manga), and they include Naoko Takeuchi’s Sailor Moon (1992–97/1997– 2001), Arina Tanemura’s Full Moon O Sagashite (2002–4/2005–6), and Chiho Saitō and Be-Papas’s Revolutionary Girl Utena (1996–98/2000–2004). Shōnen and seinen examples include Kazushi Hagiwara’s hypermasculine heroic fantasy BASTARD!! (1988–/2001–), which created a standard-setting sensation among fantasy fans in the late 1980s with anime-like character designs and detailed fantasy-settings; Eiichirō Oda’s immensely popular gag-ﬁlled, pirate-based One Piece (1997–/2002–), Makoto Inoue’s Fullmetal Alchemist (2002–/2005–), set in an alternate early twentieth century where alchemy is widely practiced; Kentarō Miura’s darkly violent medieval-based Berserk (1989–/2003–), and Masashi Kishimoto’s feudalistic ninja adventure fantasy Naruto (1999–/2002–). Juxtaposing, even colliding, the mundane against the improbable, surrealistic manga works suspend storytelling conventions for unsettling arrangements, or outright derangement, of the reader’s expectations through aﬀective or psychological states, images, and visual styles. The mangaka most prominently identiﬁed as exemplars of this visual approach include Yoshiharu Tsuge, Usamaru Furuya, and Yūko Tsuno. Tsuge garnered a cult following with Neji-shiki (Screw Style) (1967/2003) a twenty-three-page exercise in disquietude that guides the reader through eerily detailed settings, tracking a lone and nameless wanderer (Gravett 2004, 132, 138). Furuya’s manga, such as his ground-breaking Palepoli (1996*), expands on this visual mixing of techniques within a work as well as across a range of titles by aiming at the immersion of readers in the darkly humorous and arrestment of their attention with the jarringly bizarre. Palepoli draws on the four-panel tradition of manga and incorporates a range of visual references from Western art inﬂuences and manga styles and genres (Lehmann 2005, 67–69). While more subdued in her story-based arrangements of the mundane with the dreamlike, Yūko Tsuno’s manga, such as Runpunyaku (Powdered Fish Scale Medicine*; 2000) recasts some of the key motifs characteristic of the shōjo\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF MANGA GENRES\n\n37\n\ngenre by subtly interleaving the reality world of her characters with their dreams as well as places and people from their memories (Lehmann 2005, 206–11).\n\nHISTORICAL REPRESENTATIONS Manga’s capacity for graphic (re-)creation of traditional visual styles and the adaptation and retelling of traditional sources underscores how it is a medium not only for extending, but also engaging with, the historical imaginary central to contemporary Japanese identity. History in manga can include period settings as backgrounds to story lines, such as the Edo period Sakuran (2001–3*), created by the female mangaka Moyoco Anno, which follows the life of a courtesan in a red light district; the samurai dramas Lone Wolf and Cub (1970–76/2000–2002) written by Kazuo Koike and cocreated with artist Goseki Kojima; Sanpei Shirato’s The Legend of Kamui (1965–71*), and Hiroshi Hirata’s bushido drama Satsuma Gishiden (1977–83/2006–7). Renowned for their frenzied depiction of the dueling movements of sword ﬁghts, rendered with ﬂowing ink-brush strokes, and the unfolding portrayal of human drama, feudal-period manga epitomizes the gekiga style of realism emblematic of the visual storytelling challenge that gekiga artists presented to manga consumers in the 1950s and ’60s. Feudal-era Japan has also been the setting for more recently published fantasy-based manga, such as the demon-plagued world of Rumiko Takahashi’s popular Inu Yasha (1996– /1997–), while the 1878 setting of Nobuhiro Watsuki’s Rurōuni Kenshin (1994–99/2003–6) combines steam-powered locomotives with samurai weapons and dojos with business suits. European historical settings also ﬁgure prominently in manga, especially series based on historical ﬁgures, such as Riyoko Ikeda’s Eikou no Napoleon — Eroika (The Glorious Napoleon*; 1986–95) and Jirō Taniguchi and Sekigawa’s Botchan no Jidai (In the Time of Botchan*; 1987–96), based on the life of the Japanese intellectual and writer Natsume Sōseki. Even a European country can be the subject of historical treatment, as in Riyoko Ikeda’s Ten no Hate Made: Poland Hishi (To the End of the Sky, the Secret History of Poland*; 1999). Historical representations in manga can also be so steeped in historical detail that they visually convey period-speciﬁc information to their readers. Captivating examples of this approach are Yōko Iwasaki’s Ōto ayakashi kitan (1990–2002*) and Reiko Okano’s Onmyō-ji (1994–2004*), a re-creation of the life of Abe no Seimei, a Heian period (tenth century) imperial astrologer. First published in 1993, Okano’s work, based on the novel of the same name by Baku Yumemakura, exquisitely expresses meticulous attention to period speciﬁc-detail, such as costumes and rituals through tones and layers of visual patterns (Lehmann 2004, 142–50). Manga is also widely used as an educational aid as part of\n\n38\n\nMANGA\n\nthe learning of Japanese history, as in the case of Shōtarō Ishinomori’s fortyeight-volume work Manga Nihon no rekishi (The Manga History of Japan*; 1989–93), which was endorsed by the Japanese Ministry of Education and Culture (Kinsella 2000, 73). In the four decades since the ﬁrst historical gekiga manga were published, the visual documentation of historical pasts in manga have been stylistically developed and reﬁned by some of the most prominent manga artists working today. In the 1970s and ’80s Kazuichi Hanawa expanded on the oﬀerings of samurai drama with Edo, Meiji and Heian period stories that demonstrate attention to traditions and historical events as well as folkloric elements of the strange. Takehiko Inoue, the mangaka responsible for the immensely popular Slam Dunk series, has created Vagabond (1998–/2001– ), a manga adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa’s Musashi, a biographical account of the seventeenth-century warrior Miyamoto Musashi. Tatsuya Egawa, the mangaka who created the popular school dramas Be Free! and Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari (Tokyo University Story) has also produced historybased manga, such as Nichirosensō Monogatari (The Russo-Japanese War Story*; 2001–) and ﬁctional works with historical settings, such as Genji Monogatari (The Tale of Genji*; 2001–). Taken together these works evidence an extraordinary range of visual styles — from highly expressive use of form to denote speed to visual immersion of the reader in subjective points of view, as well as exacting attention to historical authenticity, even including calligraphic rendering of archaic Japanese — that are used to communicate the visual dimensions shaping or mediating Japanese experience and understanding of the historical.\n\nHORROR AND THE SUPERNATURAL Manga exploring horror and supernatural themes are perhaps the postwar genres most readily evidencing intertextual traces of elements from diﬀerent forms of Japanese storytelling, including folkloric and literary sources, religious traditions, the paranormal and urban myths as well as inﬂuences from other visual media such as magazines, ﬁlm, and fashion. Folkloric and paranormal inﬂuences can range from characters and settings that are incarnations of the phantom world of yōkai, or spirit-monster legends, to depictions of the reach of paranormal entities into the everyday world of humans (Foster 2008). The most famous character-based incarnations of yōkai are those inhabiting the pages of Shigeru Mizuki’s 1959 creation Ge Ge Ge no Kitarō (Kitaro the Spooky) (1959–69/2002) which follows the titular boy hero, an outcast and the last of a family line of yōkai, and his continual intervention in conﬂicts between the communities of ghost-goblins and humans. More recent incorporations of yōkai inﬂuences include CLAMP’s\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF MANGA GENRES\n\n39\n\nhighly stylistic xxxHolic (2003–/2004–), which follows the fated eﬀorts of a high school student to escape the spirits haunting him, and Akihisa Ikeda’s series Rosario + Vampire (2004–7, 2007–) which is set in a school for yōkai who are disguised as humans. Christian iconography and a range of Gothic inﬂuences from Western literary works and ﬁlmic imagery are also visual elements that are drawn on for setting and character design, as in CLAMP’s apocalyptic saga X/1999 (1992–2003/1996–2005), Gō Nagai’s Devilman (1972–73/2002–3) and Devilman Lady (1997–2000*); Kōta Hirano’s Hellsing (1998–/2003–) series and Bisco Hatori’s shōjo manga Millennium Snow (2001–2/2007). Young characters possessing psychic abilities or supernatural powers causing the death of others are also recurring story lines. Examples include Katsu Aki’s Psychic Academy (1999–2003/2004–6), a series about a schoolage boy undergoing self-discovery through development of his psychic powers; Tite Kubo’s monster-ﬁghting Bleach (2001–/2004–), a supernatural mixture of occult spiritualism and samurai sword prowess involving a teenager who can see ghosts; Zombie-Loan (2003–*), a series created by the mangaka duo known as Peach Pit, which depicts the ability of a young girl to psychically “see” those who will soon die; Tsugami Ohba and Takeshi Obata’s Death Note (2004–6/2005–7), which involves the ability of a notebook to induce the death of whoever has his name written in it; and Alive: The Final Evolution (2003–/2007–), Tadashi Kawashima and Toka Adachi’s unraveling of the relationship between a high school boy and mass suicides throughout the world. The genre also displays the sliding of horror toward the darkly psychological and the surrealistic. Junji Itō’s Uzumaki: Spiral into Horror (1998– 99/2001–2) depicts the inhabitants of a small Japanese town and their obsessive behavior toward — and eventual bodily infestation with — spirals. Hitoshi Iwaaki’s Parasyte (1990–95/2007–) transforms the faces and limbs of parasite-infected humans into rapaciously murderous nonhuman creatures. Shōu Tajima and Eiji Otsuka’s series MPD-Psycho (1997–2006/2007–) unfolds its story line through a number of disjointed narratives to capture the multiple personalities of an exceptional criminal proﬁler of serial killers. For horror manga works that are singularly nightmarish invocations of cruel and gruesome compositions of sadism and violence, the creations of Hideshi Hino and Suehiro Maruo remain unsurpassed. "
