Sengoku was originally released ni 1999 to criticial acclaim, excellent reviews and, soon after its release, an award for best Historic Game of 1999 (awarded by AniMail Newsletter, from Central park media). The popularity of the “samurai” genre is undisputable. Back in the early days of the role-playing and adventure gaming hobby, games such as Land of the Rising Sun and Bushidô brought the earliest glimpses of feudal Japan to the gaming table. There was a lull in samurai gaming, though over the years other games appealing to samurai fans were released, from card games to board games. I discovered Bushidô thanks to a freind of mine and fellow gamer, and I was hooked. That same year I saw the Shôgun mini-series fr the first time. I began a search to see as many samurai films as I could. Seven Samurai, Sanjuro, Yojimbo, Shôgun Assassin, Kage no Gundan...these films and television programs filled my mind and heart. Big screen or small, there was no samurai film and no period drama I could turn away from. I was a sponge. There was no turning back. As I ventured into publishing—mostly doing lcensed Hero System supplements—I decided to return to my one true love of gaming: Bushidô. I contacted the authors, Paul Hume and Robert Charrette about revising and relaunching the game in a new edition. A short time later we had a signed agreement and Bushidô Third Edition was in development! A short time later a card game was released that, once again, popularized the feudal Japanese setting in adventure games. Legend of the Five Rings was a hit, and thousands of new fans of the genre were born. An L5R role-playing game was planned soon to follow the card game. AEG approached me to work on the L5R project and to write the L5R RPG core book, knowing that I had already landed the Bushidô license and that I had a penchant for historical, feudal Japan and all things samurai. As fate would have it, AEG decided to go with a more “high fantasy”-style setting for their games and, ultimately, with an in-house developer— John Wick. The collectible card game was released, once again, popularized the feudal Japanese setting in adventure games. Legend of the Five Rings CCG was a hit, and thousands of new fans of the genre were born. The L5R role-playing game was released not long after, and bth continue to be enjoyed by fans around the world. (The L5R games are beautiful—and fun! If you’re into a more high fantasy, amalgamized Asian setting, check them out! To complicate things further, Fantasy Games Unlimited (publishers of the 1981 edition of Bushidô, contacted me regarding our plan to publish Bushidô Third Edition. FGU maintained a claim of the Bushidô trademark. Though we had a license to publish the rules, they disputed our intended use of the Bushidô name. After discussions with FGU, we ultimately decided to develop our own, new game. The result of several years of work and the wonderful talents of many people listed in the credits page is what you hold in your hands. Sengoku is a work of love: a love of the history, a love ofthe culture, a love of the chanbara and jidai-geki, and a love of gaming. It is my sincere hope that you, too, love Sengoku and, if you do not already love the genre as we do, that you will soon.

Sengoku is also a word meaning “Warring States,” and refers to a period of Japanese history marked by nearly incessant civil warfare, jockeying for position by rival warlords and samurai clans, and a near total breakdown of the social order. When you see the word in italicized, small capital letters, like this— SENGOKU—we are referring to the game. When you see it written in normal type capitalized or not, we are referring to that period in history, or something related to it. We may speak of sengoku politics, sengoku history, the Sengoku Period—or we may speak of the SENGOKU game. Japan’s Sengoku Period encompassed roughly the latter half of the sixteenth century. Some historians consider it to have begun as early as 1467, with the beginning of the Ônin War (1467– 1477), although most ascribe it to some nebulous date in the 1550s. Its close is generally marked to be the Battle of Sekigahara (Oct. 21, 1600), in which the Western Army of Tokugawa Ieyasu overcame the Toyotomi Loyalists of the Eastern Army, led by Ishida Mitsunari. It was this battle that secured Tokugawa rule over Japan, although it wasn’t finally ensured until the twin Ôsaka Campaigns of 1615, in which the Toyotomi cause was finally crushed. For this reason, some put the end of the Sengoku Period at 1615. For the purposes of this game, the Sengoku Period is given to be 1542 to 1600, inclusive. In 1542, Japan encountered Europeans for the first time, when a ship wrecked off the coast of a tiny island called Tanegashima and Fernan Mendez Pinto stepped ashore, bearing the first firearm the Japanese had ever seen. This was to prove to be a pivotal event for the future of Japanese politics, to say nothing of the concept of warfare and bushidô. 1600, of course, marks the establishment of the Tokugawa as supreme in Japan, virtually putting an end to war and strife. This “end of warfare” was only virtual, however; uprisings and occasional rebellions would still occur, but they were no longer the rule. Now, they were the exception. Unfortunately for many would-be gamers, most of the television series and films with which we are familiar are actually set in the Tokugawa Period. The Seven Samurai, for example, takes place a few years after the Ôsaka Campaign. Things such as yakuza (“the Japanese Mafia”) gangs didn’t come into being until the Tokugawa were in charge, so certain elements of society one might expect to find in the game won’t appear here. They will, however, appear in a future supplement to this core rule book—one which will focus specifically on the developments of the Tokugawa Period.\n\n6\n\nWHAT IS ROLEPLAYING?\n\nIn a roleplaying game (called RPG for short), players create and develop Player Characters (PCs). These player characters interact with Non-player Characters (NPCs) that are run by the Game Master (GM). How do the PCs and NPCs work? The player guides his PC, deciding the PCs actions, what he says, where he goes, etc. The GM, who has created the world in which they are playing, has his store of NPCs whom he controls. With the aid of dice, used to determine certain random elements like the success or failure of specific actions or the “damage” taken in combat, players and GMs alike are in control of their game. It is purely interactive. The GM will plot out an adventure, and it is up to the players to follow along or even turn the game to another wholly unexpected direction. There are rule books and supplementary aids, and there may be maps and charts and even small figurines to indicate the positions of the various PCs and NPCs to aid in determining actions, but roleplaying games are unlike other games in that there is no board and no little pewter race cars or top hats. The game exists in the minds of the GM and the players. While the GM sets the parameters and the levels of historical reality, he must keep in mind the interests of his players. The world is whatever the GM and his group of players decide it is. The object of roleplaying games, unlike other games which have a definite end or victory point, is to keep your PCs alive and continue to play them another day. Even if that most feared fate befalls a PC—death—the player can create a new PC and rejoin play at a suitable point in the current, on-going adventure, which in gaming terms is usually called a campaign. That is what roleplaying games are: continuous adventures with the same PCs acting and interacting in their fictional world. An RPG isn’t about dressing up in funny black pajamas and grabbing a sword and going out into the night as Lord Ninja Master of the Universe, or getting someone else to put on armor and whaling on each other with mock swords. While that is a form of role-play—indeed, so-called “live action roleplaying” (or LARP) is popular in some circles—it can’t replicate or even simulate the full measure of a fantasy roleplaying game. For this reason, we don’t suggest you try any of this at home. Some of us have already, and it hurts. Besides, we can’t figure out how to get those mythical beasts to show up to play with us… It’s all in the mind.\n\nROLEPLAYING ETIQUETTE\n\nEtiquette in gaming is more than just who brings the chips, pays for the pizza and drinks, and whose living room gets taken over on any given gaming session. Here are a few rules to keep in mind for happy gaming.\n\nA samurai in service must always be careful not to indulge in underhanded censure of any faults of his comrades that he happens to hear of or see. For a man can’t calculate how far he may not have unwittingly mistaken or misunderstood these things. — Daidôji Yûzan\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nNo Hogging the Game\n\nThere are several people playing. No one should be the center of attention for the entire game. If there are five of you, each person gets one-fifth of the limelight.\n\nHave Respect\n\nThis goes both ways. Without the players, the GM is nothing, and without the GM, there is no game. Don’t try to browbeat each other; don’t try to be a “rules lawyer.” It’s called a roleplaying game. Have fun.\n\nThe GM Rules\n\nThis is not a democracy. The GM is the boss. You should feel free to ask questions, but when a ruling is made, accept it. The GM shouldn’t have to resort to “lightning bolts from nowhere” to maintain order.\n\nBe Prepared\n\nBring everything you will need: figures (if you use them), dice, pens and paper (and graph or hex paper if you map), etc. If you’re the GM, you’ll need more supplies than the rest. For example, if you play with figures, the GM may feel he needs to supply all the figures other than those of the players’ PCs. While that’s no hard and fast rule, it’s always nice to bring whatever figures you have to supplement the supply if necessary.\n\nKeep the Game the Game\n\nRemember that the game sessions are not real life. If someone makes a mistake in the game and gets your PCs killed, don’t ostracize that person. It’s not worth it. Conversely, don’t let your game suffer because of outside animosities. If you’re upset because the guy across the table is dating your ex-girlfriend, don’t use that as an excuse to hire an assassin to kill his PC. Try to keep your worlds separate.\n\nRole Play\n\nThe rônin Kawamura Matahei is not Oscar Rivera. Neither is Diana Bartnett the cunning kunoichi O-Gin. Play your characters as they should be played. Your samurai don’t know about many things you do (for example, the first time they encounter some supernatural being, remember that your PCs haven’t read the bestiary; all they know is something big, dark, and scary is out there). A GM might even want to give bonus points for exceptional roleplaying.\n\nCHANBARA ROLEPLAYING\n\nThe Sengoku Japan of your game bears no more nor less reality than you wish it to. Whatever melieu you choose to play in— whether you prefer the gritty realism of a true historical campaign, the more elaborate whirling blades and fantastic elements of a “magic is real” adventure of a chanbara epic, or the anything-goes anime genre—the SENGOKU game has what you want. Your game is what you make it, and what you let it become.\n\nYou may be familiar with the different levels of these gaming environments, but take a quick look at the options and gaming style represented by each. That way, you can more easily choose the style of play suited to your interests. You may even find that you will want to play different levels of reality, occasionally using the more fantastic and occasionally dropping into the “real world” of feudal Japan (which could be adventurous enough!). It might be better if you don’t mix the elements too broadly, although there is no reason you can’t set limitations on how much magic or how “unreal” you are willing to let the game become. As with all roleplaying games, the world in which you play is what you choose it to be. Before beginning a campaign, the GM should sit down with his players and discuss the issue, to avoid unpleasant surprises later. Because SENGOKU is a game which primarily simulates the chanbara action cinema, it is thus set in the “Chanbara” (or “Heroic” in the Fuzion gaming system terminology) gaming level. GMs can easily run campaigns with a more historical level of “realism” simply by changing the “reality level” of the game.\n\nHistorical\n\nCampaigns that are strictly Historical (“Competent” in Fuzion terminology) may take two tracks: they can be ultra-realistic, utilizing actual historical backdrops and personalities (e.g., the assassination of Oda Nobunaga, intrigues in Hideyoshi’s court, the Battle of Okehazama, etc.); or they can be realistic but apply to a parallel Japan, one in which a player character can raise his own clan and perhaps some day even become shôgun. Whichever option you prefer, you will have to have an understanding of the culture of the period. This sourcebook will tell you how to play the game, and will give you a fundamental grounding in the society and world of late sixteenth-century Japan; but you will probably want to refer to some of the books in the bibliography to more fully round out aspects of play. Films that give a good idea of this realistic form of play are Kagemusha, Throne of Blood, Seven Samurai, Rikyû, The Hidden Fortress, Heaven and Earth, Ran, Yojimbo, Sanjurô, and Shôgun. Films emphasizing a little more incredible action than most reality-based games are good for ideas of where you can take your campaign. This is perhaps the broadest field of samurai film (called jidai-geki, or “period plays,” in Japanese). While not entirely realistic, they are not beyond the ken of imagination, and there is no magical or fantastic element per se which enters into them.\n\nChanbara\n\nSENGOKU adventures that include more of a fantasy aspect and more spectacular characters are called “Chanbara” campaigns. In these games, PCs may have skills and attributes that would place them beyond the realm of most normal people. Magic and other elements of the fantastic will also be a regular part of the game. PCs will interact with not only other humans, but they might en-\n\nWhen we throw off our own bias, follow the teachings of the ancients and confer with other people, matters should go well and without mishap. — Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n\n7\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION Magic is Rare: While there is a place for “magic,” it is typicounter tengu, kappa, or even fierce oni.

Mifune Toshirô demonstrates and future SENGOKU products and supplements will also be writthis quite well in many of his films. ten primarily for the Chanbara Level; however, other levels will be represented in future gaming accessories as well.\n\nAnime\n\nIn an Anime style (“Superheroic”) campaign, anything goes. That’s about all you can say. The kind of abilities and actions that take place in anime games are most often indicated by animated Japanese films and television series, hence the application of the title “anime” (which literally means “animation”) for this genre. It is in this game form in which magic and the supernatural are more common than not. The various kami and Buddhas may play an active part in the life of humans. The Anime level will be only lightly covered in this core SENGOKU rule book. Future supplements (based on popular feudal-era anime, such as the Hakkenden series, Undead Yomi, Ninja Scroll, Kabuto and Dagger of Kamui, etc.) will provide the kind of material for running a true Anime level game.\n\nChanbara Inspiration\n\nFor a thorough list of chanbara films and videos, see the filmography at the back of this book. Many of the films listed are now available for rent and purchase, thanks to several companies which have begun new efforts to bring these films to the American video market.\n\n8\n\nThe Way of the Samurai is in desperateness. Ten men or more cannot kill such a man. Common sense will not accomplish great things. Simply become insane and desperate. In Bushidô, if one uses discrimination, he will fall behind. One needs neither loyalty nor devotion, but simply to become desperate in Bushidô. Loyalty and devotion are of themselves within desperation. — Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n\nLINGUISTIC CONVENTIONS\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nJapanese history can be divided into “eras” and “periods.” While the terms may in many contexts be interchangeable, for the sake of SENGOKU we will use the latter term to indicate sometimes overlapping historical time frames as defined by historians (e.g., the Sengoku Period, the Tokugawa Period, the Fujiwara Period, etc.) and the former to indicate nengô, or “era names” as given by emperors and other worthies (e.g., Bunka Era, Genki Era, etc.). It is only since the Imperial Restoration in 1868 that the era and period names have been the same (i.e., Meiji Era, Taishô Era, Shôwa Era, and Heisei Era). What this means is that during the time of the Sengoku Period, Japan saw many eras come and go. For personal names, the order is surname first, given name last. Tokugawa Ieyasu was Ieyasu of the Tokugawa family. This rendering of names is used throughout this rule book. Almost invariably when someone is referred to by only one name, it is a given name. In modern history books, even in Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu is referred to initially with his full name, and thereafter as “Ieyasu,” unlike Western history books who never talk about “George” crossing the Delaware River. Geographical and proper place names in Japanese usually (but not universally) include in their name the element they are. Thus we will not speak of the Arakawa River; rather, we will say Arakawa (“Rough River”). Likewise, we will say Enryaku-ji, rather than Enryakuji Temple (nor will we say Enryaku Temple). To those who speak Spanish and have long chafed at references such as “Rio Grande River” and “Sierra Madre Mountains,” this idea should be clear. An appendix at the back of this book gives common geographical terms in Japanese for GMs wanting to more accurately flavor their campaign, or to understand words that may appear on a map or in a conversation between PCs and NPCs.\n\nPronunciation\n\nJapanese is a syllabic, generally uninflected, language. When letters are doubled (the vowels u and o being so identified by macrons), they are given a double duration (e.g. the T sound in “hit tune” or the O in “Go over!”). In general, letters are pronounced the same as in English, with a few necessary cautions: Consonants: G—always hard, as in gold, never soft as in gem. J—always soft, as in jet. R—lightly trilled, similar to in the British very (“veddy” ). S—always soft, never hard as in his. CH—always hard, as in church. TCH—a lengthened ch, similar to the sound in fat chance. Vowels: A—as in father. E—somewhere between bed and hay. When a final vowel, it is always pronounced (e.g. Kansuke is pronounced as “Kawn-skay.”) I—as in machine. O—as in boat. U—as in chute. EI—as in bait. AI—as in rite. Within words, the vowels u and i are weak, and often not pronounced; at the end of words, a u sometimes disappears. English has a tendency to put the stress on penultimate syllables; for ex-\n\nPeople who talk on and on about matters of little importance most likely have some complaint in the back of their mind. But so as to be ambiguous and to hide this they repeat what they are saying over and over again. To hear something like this causes doubt to arise in one’s heart. — Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n\n9\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION ample, to pronounce the name Yamashita as “Yama-SHEE-ta.” In fact, Japanese pronunciation is more accurately Distance in SENGOKU is measured not in feet or yards or meters, “Yamash’ta.” but in “shaku,” “ken,” and “jô.” One shaku is almost exactly a One thing that must be remembered is the linguistic strictures of the language. foot; one ken is roughly equal to six feet, or nearly two meters; a There are a few consonant-vowel combi- jô is 10 shaku, or 10 feet.

Rather, it provides an overview of the basic knowledge that a normal well-educated PC is likely to know. For more specific historical information, consult the reading list in the appendix. Remember that you are the master of your game: if certain historical elements don’t fit with your game, feel free to change them to suit your needs. For example, if you want to play SENGOKU in a type of “what–if” scenario in which the Minamoto shôgunate never fell, you can; but you’ll need to do some research into what government under the Minamoto was like. Future supplements to SENGOKU may focus more closely on certain historical periods, allowing you to place a game during the heady days of the latter Heian Period, when rival Taira and Minamoto clans shared the imperial bloodline and battled for supremacy; the chaos of the mid-fifteenth century, when the social structure started to crumble and upstart warlords from petty provinces became great lords overnight; or even the mist-enshrouded days of prehistory, before Buddhism and Sinophilia took hold, when Japan was still a land to be conquered, and the gods had a more direct hand in daily life.\n\nMYTHICAL ORIGINS OF JAPAN\n\nJapan’s mythological origins are recorded in the Kojiki (“A Record of Ancient Things”), a book written in 711 by the historian Ô-no-Yasumaro. The Kojiki is also a history book about Japan’s earliest days, although its history is no more reliable than its myth. The first emperor, according to the Kojiki, was Jinmu Tennô, son of Amaterasu Ômikami, goddess of the sun. Jinmu ruled, according to the legends, from 660–585 BC. In point of fact, if such a person ever existed at all, he would have had to have reigned sometime in the fourth century, as it was not until that time that the Yamato state began to unify the nation. Be that as it may, no one living in Japan in the sixteenth century would have any qualms about accepting the Imperial House’s claims of antiquity, nor the ahistorical dates indicated by the Kojiki. It was simply taken as a matter of faith that Japan was the Land of the Gods, and the emperor in Miyako was the Son of Heaven, latest in an unbroken line from the goddess herself. For a detailed look at the cosmology and mythical origins of Japan, see the chapter on Religion.\n\nCAPSULE HISTORY, ERA TO ERA\n\nMost of the periods of Japanese history are taken from the location of the center of the government of the time. It is interesting to note that although after 794 the imperial capital was in Kyôto (then called Heian-kyô), once the military aristocracy rose to power, the de facto seat of Japan’s government was wherever the ruling house established it: the town of Kamakura was the seat of\n\n12\n\nMinamoto (and later Hôjô) power; Muromachi was a Kyôto district chosen by the Ashikaga for their headquarters; Azuchi was Nobunaga’s castle; and Momoyama was the site of one of Hideyoshi’s castles. Note also that the so-called Sengoku Period is comprised of the entire Azuchi and Momoyama Periods, and part of the Muromachi Period. (This is why this time is often referred to in history books as “Muromachi-Momoyama,” or “Azuchi–Momoyama.”)\n\nPREHISTORY (TO 592)\n\nIn c. AD 200, Empress Jingô leads an invasion of Korea and subjugates it to Japanese rule. Her son, the emperor Ôjin, will be deified as Hachiman, the god of war. Among the gifts from Korea are writing and the Buddhist religion. In 538, Buddhism reaches Japan. Emperor Yômei proposes that it become the state religion in 587. Soga no Umako supports this proposal, which is opposed by Katsumi no Nakatomi and Katsumi no Moriya, who favor Shintô; in the ensuing conflict, the Soga emerge victorious.\n\nASUKA PERIOD (592–710)\n\nThe imperial court moves to Asuka, in Yamato, near Nara. The Asuka Period sees the imperial house solidify control over the land. During this period, Buddhism strengthens as the official state religion, the imperial court of Japan adopts the Chinese model, and refugee artisans from Korea come to Japan. The first Japanese coins are minted in 708. The old order falls apart, and a new order based on Sino–Buddhist concepts rises to power under the eyes of the Fujiwara Clan. Regent Prince Shôtoku institutes social reforms based on Sino– Buddhist concepts in 604. The ancient Soga clan, continuing to gain power and influence, annihilates the family of Prince Shôtoku in 643. Prince Naka no Oe and Nakatomi no Kamatari join forces and assassinate Soga no Iruka and bring down the Soga, banishing many of the clan. Naka no Oe becomes Crown Prince; Kamatari, Minister of the Center. They issue the Taika Reforms, a series of social reforms based on Chinese models, which establishes era names (the first being Taika, or “Great Change”), in 645. Naka no Oe becomes emperor as Tenji Tennô in 668; Kamatari takes the name Fujiwara no Kamatari. His family will “run” Japan for the next several centuries. In 672, a dispute over imperial succession leads to the short but bloody Jinshin Revolt; Prince Ôama defeats prince Ôtomo, and becomes the next emperor. In 701, the Taihô Code, covering civil and penal matters, is established.\n\nNARA PERIOD (710–794)\n\nEmpress Genmei moves the capital to Nara. The cultivation of rice is first encouraged. Chinese becomes the language of learning, culture, science, and literature. Chinese knowledge grows as scholars from Japan go to T’ang China to study, and Buddhist priests come from China to establish temples. The Great Buddha at Tôdai-ji is completed in 752. The priest Ganjin arrives from China in 754. The Shôsôin, a national treasury-house, is built at Tôdai-ji. Jealous over the influence of a Buddhist monk over a retired empress, Fujiwara no Nakamaro seizes power in 757, and in an attempt to gain further power and arrest the priest in 764, he leads an uprising but is defeated and executed.\n\nOne should not think he can hire others and have them do everything, but rather he should be of the mind to rely on himself and to know the condition of things. Only then should he delegate to others. — Hojo Nagauji\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nHEIAN PERIOD (794–1192)\n\nThe capital is moved to Heian-kyô (the “Capital of Peace and Calm”). The power of the emperors wanes as the court officials and bureaucrats gain more influence. For the first time, families not descended from imperial lines hold the highest offices in the land, including the regency. Literature flourishes as The Tale of Genji and other books are written. Retired emperors begin to establish puppet master governments from their villas in Buddhist temples. Often, several generations of retired emperors struggle to pull the same strings in various directions, leading to political maneuverings by the courtiers. This is begun by retired emperor Shirakawa in 1086, who also first gives bushi direct access to court officials by establishing a guard of samurai to defend his palace. Kôbô-daishi (Kûkai) returns from China and establishes Shingon Buddhism in 805. In 806, Saichô introduces Tendai Buddhism. The Nenbutsu sect of Buddhism is promulgated by Kûya in 938. Jôdô (“Pure Land”) Buddhism begins to flourish after Hônen begins to preach in 1175. Rinzai-zen Buddhism begins in 1191, taught by Yôsai. Not all relations with the monks of various sects are peaceful: conflict breaks between Enjô-ji and Enryaku-ji monks in 1035. In 1037, Kôfuku-ji monks destroy part of Tôdaiji. Bands of warrior monks will periodically appear in the capital to press demands on the government. The most illustrious branches of the Minamoto clan—the Saga Genji and the Seiwa Genji—are created when Emperors Saga and Seiwa give that surname (meaning “origin”) to cadet branches of the imperial house. The surname Taira (“Peace” or “Level”) is given to another line of imperial descendants. In 866, the Ôten-mon (a gate at the imperial palace) was burned; the resulting investigation into the plot leads to the fall of two clans, allowing the Fujiwara to monopolize government posts thereafter. In 887, Fujiwara no Mototsune becomes first kanpaku (imperial regent). The rise of the military class is marked by disturbances in the provinces, where the real rulers of the land—the samurai—test their might against the aristocratic governors ensconced far away in the capital. In 935, Taira no Masakado raises an army in the provinces and declares himself “the new emperor” in the Tengyô Revolt. The conflict lasts until 940, when Masakado is killed. Fujiwara no Michizane maneuvers behind the scenes to seize power in 995, and becomes regent in 1015. The Fujiwara, once a military house, soften and become effete; the Taira and Minamoto alternately attempt to wrest control of the government from them and support them in putting down other insurrections, while occasionally battling each other for position. Abe no Yoritoki of Mutsu rebels in 1051, starting the Zen-kunen (“Earlier NineYear”) War, and is put down by Minamoto no Yoriyoshi and others. Kiyohara no Iehira (also of Mutsu) revolts in 1083, beginning the Go-sannen (“Later Five-Year”) War; he is put down by Minamoto no Yoshiie. When Minamoto no Yoshichika (a son of Yoshiie) plunders Kyûshû in 1101, he is put down several years later by Taira no Masanori. The Hôgen and Heiji Insurrections (1156 and 1159, respectively) lay waste to large parts of Heian-kyô. In the former, one branch of the Fujiwara and a retired emperor try to oppose the reigning emperor (Go-Shirakawa) and another branch of the Fujiwara, aided by the Taira. Go-Shirakawa emerges victorious, and Taira no Kiyomori’s fortune is made. In the Heiji Insurrection, a\n\nMinamoto–Fujiwara alliance is formed to oppose Taira no Kiyomori and his Fujiwara supporters. The insurrection fails, and Yoritomo is exiled to Izu. Kiyomori becomes regent and his daughter becomes Emperor Takakura’s empress. After a failed conspiracy to overthrow the Taira, Kiyomori has the retired enperor Go-Shirakawa confined. In 1180, the Genpei (“Minamoto–Taira”) War begins as Prince Mochihito and Minamoto no Yorimasa rebel against the Taira and are defeated. Minamoto no Yoritomo and Yoshinaka raise the flag of revolt. Taira no Shigehira burns Tôdai-ji and Kôfukuji to put down rebellious monks. Yoshinaka enters Kyôto in 1183, but his country bumpkin ways and excessive behavior get him recalled by Yoritomo. In 1185, Minamoto no Yoshitsune annihilates the Taira army in a sea battle at Dan-no-Ura. Yoshitsune is falsely denounced by jealous rivals, and he is ordered hunted down and killed by his brother Yoritomo. Yoritomo becomes shôgun in 1192.\n\nKAMAKURA PERIOD (1192–1333)\n\nYoritomo established his bakufu (“tent government” or the shôgunate) in Kamakura to keep it away from court influences. His house only lasts briefly, as through intrigues from his wife’s family, the Hôjô, the third Minamoto shôgun, Sanetomo, is assassinated in 1219. Emperor Go-Toba tried to regain control, but a huge army under Hôjô Yasutoki easily defeated Go-Toba’s forces. In 1226, the first puppet shôgun is set up by the Hôjô regents: 9-year-old Fujiwara no Yoritsune. Henceforth, the true power is the Hôjô regency. During this period, the shôgun will be puppets. Some will be Fujiwara, some even Imperial princes. Several new Buddhist sects are founded. The Jôdô-shin-shu (the Ikkô movement) appear in 1224, led by Shinran. Dôgen founds Sôdô-zen Buddhism in 1227. In 1253, Nichiren begins Hokke (or Nichiren) Buddhism. Ippen promulgates the Ji sect in 1275. The Kamakura Period begins a feudalistic age that will last for the rest of Japan’s history. The emperor is now a figurehead— well-respected and honored, and at times revered, but a figurehead nonetheless. From time to time emperors will try to gain control of the government, and for a while they may actually succeed; but ultimately the power belongs to the military aristocracy, who have the manpower, swords, and the wealth-producing estates to keep control. The once rustic samurai revel in their newfound authority and remake themselves in an aristocratic, educated image. When the Mongol navy of Kublai Khan suddenly attacks Kyûshû in 1274, no one is prepared. Only good fortune prevents defeat. In 1281, a larger armada from Mongol-ruled China, this time meeting strong resistance. Still, they are only driven off by a phenomenal typhoon—the kamikaze, or spirit wind. The cost of mounting these defenses nearly destroy the bakufu. The government is severely weakened. Emperor Go-Daigo launches several schemes to overthrow the Kamakura government, and fails each time. He is finally exiled to Oki Island after the Genkô Insurrection of 1331. In 1333, Nitta Yoshisada and Ashikaga Takauji seize both the imperial and bakufu capitals, and end the Kamakura shôgunate.\n\nDuring any military affair, no matter how important the event may be, when something is communicated by word of mouth, the least bit of vagueness will invite grievous results. — Asakura Soteki\n\n13\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION\n\nMUROMACHI PERIOD (1333–1573)\n\nThis age begins marked by the split of the imperial house into two lines, each vying for the throne. While the split began in the last half of the Kamakura Period, the involvement of bushi in the equation makes it a much more bloody situation. Ashikaga Takauji restores imperial rule (the Kenmu Restoration) in 1334, but he supports Emperor Kômyô of the northern line. Go-Daigo, who had struggled with the Kamakura shôgunate, claims orthodoxy as rightful emperor of the southern line, thereby beginning what is now called the Nanboku-chô (“Northern and Southern Court”) Period in 1336. Takauji’s first action is to defeat erstwhile allies Kusunoki Masashige and Nitta Yoshisada. He is named shôgun in 1338, and establishes his government in the Muromachi district (then called Fushimi) of Kyôto. Unlike previous periods, all the shôgun of the Muromachi Period will be heads of the Ashikaga clan. Opulence and splendor are the bywords of this era, as they build temple after temple, literally cover the walls of one retirement villa with gold leaf, create huge estates with aesthetically perfect gardens, and outdo each other in dress and refinement. During this period (c. 1441) Zeami perfects the Nô play. The tea ceremony and flower arranging begin to flourish. The rivalry between the Northern and Southern courts erupts into warfare in Kyôto in 1355. The conflict finally ends when Emperor Go-Kameyama of the Northern court yields the throne to Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Southern court in 1392. When an emperor of the Northern line is installed in 1412, contrary to the agreement whereby the throne would alternate between emperors of the Northern and Southern lines, hostile feelings break out and a rebellion is quickly put down in Ise; but the warfare is over as people are just worn out, and peace slowly settles in. Because of the rivalry between courts, families jockey for position by allying first one way and then the next, with loyalties going to the highest bidder. This can be seen as the beginning of the end for the old loyalty-do-or-die mentality more typical of the Heian and Kamakura Periods. Several rebellions and insurrections occur over the decades, but are put down. Japan also has trouble with wakô (Japanese pirates). The seabased raiders, mostly Japanese but partially Korean (and occasionally led by Chinese), harry fishing and trading industries. The situation is so bad that an envoy from Ming China asks Japan to do something about the pirates. They are largely put down by the middle of the fifteenth century. The greatest crisis of the Ashikaga Period is the Ônin War of 1467–1477. The war’s causes are extremely complex: suffice to say that it combines all the worst elements of a succession dispute for the shôgunate, a rivalry over a politically powerful office, a dispute over which son would rule a powerful clan, disagreements between in-laws, and old intra–clan (and inter–clan) grudges that needed settling. When the dust clears, Kyôto is a burned out shamble, thousands have died, the Hosokawa and Yamana clans will never be the same, and the power and prestige of the Muromachi shôgun is broken. The long–standing policy that daimyô infighting would be quelled by the bakufu as injurious to society is lost for good, and clans constantly vie with one another for power and influence. Loyalty and other familiar trademarks of bushidô are more rhe-\n\n14\n\ntorical concepts than a real ideals. The main fighting is over in 1477, but in point of fact it will not end until 1600. This marks the rise of the gekokujô daimyô, those who rose to prominence from nowhere. Hôjô Sôun becomes one of the most famous of theirr number. In 1488, the Ikkô sect rises up in Kaga, taking control of the whole province. In 1506, they rise again in Kaga. They are not quelled until 1531, when Asakura Norikage of Echizen suppresses them.\n\nSPECIFIC HISTORY OF THE SENGOKU GAME PERIOD MUROMACHI (1542–1573)\n\n1542: Towards the end of August, a Portuguese ship lands at Tanegashima and introduces the matchlock arquebus to Japan. 1549: St. Francis Xavier arrives in Kagoshima on a mission trip. 1555: Rival daimyô Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen fight to a draw at Kawanakajima. 1560: In a reputation-making battle at Okehazama, Oda Nobunaga’s 2,000-man force overwhelms a 25,000man army and kills Imagawa Yoshimoto. 1565: Shôgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru is assassinated by Miyoshi Yoshitsugu and Matsunaga Hisahide. 1568: Nobunaga, in support of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, enters Kyôto and has him installed as shôgun. 1569: Nobunaga approves Luis Frois’s request and allows Christian preaching in Kyôto. 1570: Nobunaga defeats the Asai and Asakura at the battle of Anegawa. 1570: First Portuguese trading ship arrives in Nagasaki.

The Sengoku Period comes to a close.\n\nPOST – POST– SENGOKU JAPAN\n\nIf you wish, you may place your campaign in a more structured world of a Japan under the Tokugawa bakufu. Although there are changes in the society that are not specifically covered in this core rule book (notably the rise of the yakuza and the exclusion of foreigners), you should be able to play in this milieu with no difficulties. Just to make things easy, we provide a short look at some of the changes during the early part of the long Tokugawa rule. A future SENGOKU gaming supplement is planned to provide specifics for gaming in the less warlike—but no less adventuresome—Edo Period, also known as the Tokugawa Jidai.\n\nEDO/TOKUGAWA (1600–1868)\n\nIeyasu becomes shôgun in 1603 and establishes his capital far to the northeast of Kyôto in the town of Edo. Kabuki dances (by women) are recorded for the first time in that same year (female kabuki is formally banned in 1629 as dangerous to morals). In 1605, Ieyasu resigns in favor of his son, Hidetada, remaining the power behind the throne behind the throne. The Dutch arrive in Japan, and establish a trading house in Hirado in 1609. In 1610, a Japanese boat built from William Adams’s design travels to Mexico to trade. The Christian church is banned formally in 1612, and churches are burned in Kyôto and elsewhere. In 1622, 55 Christians are executed in Nagasaki. In 1614, Ieyasu begins the completion of the destruction of the Toyotomi family. Fabricating an “insult” against himself from Hideyori, Ieyasu launches the Winter Campaign which destroys much of Ôsaka Castle’s defenses. Many disaffected samurai rally to the Toyotomi banner. The summer of the next year he launches the final campaign which burns the castle to the ground. Hideyori commits suicide. Ieyasu orders that there be only one castle per province, resulting in the destruction and dismantling of many older, less strategically sound fortifications. Ieyasu dies in 1616 The term “daimyô,” which used to refer to any feudal lord or provincial military governor, is now restricted to those with domains producing an income of 10,000 koku or greater, and were obligated to serve the shôgun. There were some 265 daimyô families during the Edo Period. Japanese ports are declared off-limits for Spanish ships in 1624, and Japanese ships without government license to trade internationally are banned in 1633; this is the first step in closing off the country to outsiders, although a small Dutch colony will remain— first in Hirado and later in its island ghetto of Dejima in Nagasaki—throughout the Edo Period. Two years later, Japanese are banned from leaving for or returning from foreign countries. Portuguese ships are banned in 1639, completing the isolation process. The sankin kôtai (a system of alternate residences, which requires a daimyô to alternate spending one year in Edo and one year in his home province) is established in 1635. This serves the multiple purposes of forcing daimyô to have two expensive residences which they must upkeep all year round, leaving hostages\n\n…if a master begins to feel that he is despised by his retainers, he will very soon go mad.

This is one way the shôgunate keeps daimyô from being able to cause trouble. It also helps spread wealth throughout the nation as the large entourages moves back and forth across the countryside. A rebellion in Shimabara against the privations of a cruel daimyô breaks out in 1637. Disaffected samurai and large numbers of rônin rally to the cause of the oppressed clans. Many of the 37,000 slain in the castle’s defense are Christian samurai, leading to the popular conclusion that the Shimabara Revolt is Christian-instigated. This failed insurrection, and the 1649 policies of the government restricting daimyô houses, increases the number of rônin roaming the land. In 1643, Miyamoto Musashi, Japan’s most famous swordsman, writes his treatise, The Book of Five Rings. In 1701, Asano Naganori, the daimyô of Akô, is forced to commit seppuku after drawing his sword in the shôgun’s palace to attack an official who’d embarrassed him. Forty-seven of his retainers plot their revenge for a whole year. They strike in the dead of winter and behead Kira Yoshinaka, the official who’d brought about the fall of their house. Although they are ordered to commit seppuku for this act, many commoners and not a few bakufu officials view it as the sine qua non of bushidô and loyalty; the 47 rônin of Akô are enshrined in Japanese legend, and their leader, Ôishi Kuranosuke, becomes a popular hero. Japan’s government would continue to grow more bureaucratic and byzantine.\n\n“WHAT -IF?” “WHATSCENARIOS\n\nIn addition to the powerful ““what–if” provided by the existence of magic and supernatural beings, there are aspects of Japan’s history that you may want to ignore or alter slightly to make a much more personalized version of Japan for your game.

Is it possible that it could be in the same position as the Christian religion—tolerated, allowed, but held with suspicion—only a couple of centuries farther along in terms of numbers and social effects?

In order to make maximum use of the arable land (estimated at no more that 10 percent of the total land mass), the Japanese have developed state-of-the-art farming techniques, including cutting terraces into the sides of hills and even mountains, enabling them to plant and harvest rice, wheat, and other crops. The towns and cities, unfortunately, occupy prime farming land, as they are in no less need of vast amounts of flat land. The following sections describes the main islands of Japan, and its provinces as defined in the 16th century, with notes of important landmarks, geography, production and culture.\n\n18\n\nTo think of receiving the blessings of the master without fulfilling the duties of court service is no different from trying to cross a rough sea without a boat. — Hojo Shigetoki\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nGEOGRAPHY\n\nThere are three islands of import in the archipelago: Honshû, Kyûshû, and Shikoku. While all of Japan is mountainous, some areas are worse than others. There are so many islands that some aren’t even populated, and many are ignored.\n\nHONSHÛ\n\nHonshû—also called Hondo—is the center of the government, the largest and most populated island. If it really matters, it happens here, or at least that’s what most people think. Shikoku and Kyûshû are the boondocks, and people on those islands are considered more provincial and less sophisticated.\n\nMountains\n\nFujisan, Hibariyama, Hiezan, Kôyasan, Asajiyama, Kihayama, Komagatake, Kabasan, Tsukubasan, Kumotoriyama, Shiramine, Ashitakayama, Asahiyama, Daimukenzan, Sanageyama, ôdaiharayama, Amagisan, Kamizan, Nokoginiyama, Ôyama, Iwakuyama, Tomaridake, Akakuradake, Osoreyama, Nakuidake, Tokusayama, Togawayama, Ômoriyama, Shinjôzan, Daibutsudaki, Moriyoshiyama, Iwateyama, Sengokuzan, Bandaizan, Azumasan, Asashidake, Myôgisan, Washinosuyama, Beppusan, Ariakeyama, Kuraiyama, Dainichidake, Nantaizan, Kisosan, Kamisoriyama, Enasan, Akaishiyama, Tateyama, Myôhôzan, Nachisan, Yukihikoyama, Ôgiyama, Izumiyama, Aonoyama, Iôzan, Kurohasan, Mikamiyama, Gongenyama.\n\nLakes\n\nBiwa, Ôtsu, Suwa, Kasumigauru, Inawashiro, Shinjikô.\n\nRivers\n\nYodogawa, Kizugawa, Yoshinogawa, Totsugawa, Kinogawa, Tenryûgawa, Hidagawa, Kisogawa, Omonogawa, Kitakamigawa, Agagawa, Shirakawa, Gôgawa, Ichikawa Chigusagawa, Kagogawa.\n\nPlains\n\nKantô, Nobi.\n\nKYÛSHÛ\n\nKyûshû is the site of Ningi-no-Mikoto’s arrival on earth when he was sent by his ancestor, Amaterasu, to subdue the land. As the southernmost island, it was the launching point for Empress Jingû’s assault on Korea, as well as being the launching point for Hideyoshi’s attacks on Korea. When the Mongols attacked in the 12th century, they landed in Kyûshû, near Hakata. The bay between Satsuma and Ôsumi provinces is protected by the island of Sakurajima, which sits in the middle of the water way like a large traffic control booth. Samurai from Kyûshû have a reputation for being no-nonsense types who don’t give in readily to outside (read: Honshû) domination.\n\nMountains\n\nAsosan, Tenzan, Kunimiyama, Monjuyama, Kamuodake, Terudake.\n\nRivers\n\nSendaigawa, Yabegawa, Ônogawa, Chikugogawa, Kumagawa, Shirakawa.\n\nPlains\n\nTsukushi.\n\nSHIKOKU\n\nShikoku is so called because it is comprised of four (shi) provinces (koku). Shikoku is not very populous, but what there is is very densely populated. One mountain on Shikoku, Tengumoriyama, is rumored to be the home of the tengu, a mystic race of flying beings. Shikoku—especially the province of Iyo, where it reaches toward Honshû and the chain of islands between the Shikoku and Honshû—has been known as a hotbed of pirate activity since the 9th century.\n\nMountains\n\nNoneyama, Tengumoriyama, Kunimiyama, Setsukozan, Yahazusan, Gozaishomoriyama, Takanawayama, Sanbômoriyama, Soyasan, Jôzusan.\n\nRivers\n\nWatarigawa, Niyodogawa, Yoshinogawa, Hijigawa.\n\nSADO\n\nSado is a large island off Echigo, near Niigata. It is traditionally used as a place of exile for persons of importance who have offended the Imperial court, or even interfering ex-emperors. Nichiren was exiled here for a while. A gold mine near the town of Aikawa (worked almost exclusively by exiles) and a few fishing communities are on the island, and little else. Its main communities are the towns of Minato, Aikawa, and Ogi.\n\nMountains\n\nKinhokuzan, Dantokuzan, Iitoyoyama, Kyôzukayama.\n\nAWAJI\n\nAwaji is a roughly triangular island that nearly links Shikoku to the province of Harima in Honshû. There is a single mountain peak on the island. There are three small towns; Fukura, Sumoto, and Iwaya. Awaji was the first solid land created by Izanami and Izanagi, according to Japanese historical myth.\n\nA man who is said to be a master should, in the same way that the sun and moon shine on the grass and trees all over the land, ponder day and night with a heart of compassion into the matters of rewards and punishments for his vassals both near and far, and even to those officials separated from him by mountains and sea. And he should use those men according to their talents. — Imagawa Sadayo\n\n19\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION\n\nREGIONS & PROVINCES\n\nJapan’s Highest Mountains Fujisan Shirane Hotakadake Yorigatake Ontake Norikuradake Tateyama Asamayama Myokosan Daisetsuzan Zaozan Daisen Asosan\n\nThe nation is divided into several “circuits,” once used by the imperial court to define regions for tax and administrative purposes.

One must be resolved in advance. — Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n\n23\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION\n\nGEOLOGY\n\nJapan is mountainous. Farmers have to really work to be able to get their crops. If they are fortunate enough to live in the great plains areas in the Kantô (the “ricebasket” of Japan), farmers have no problems, but if they live in the mountains of the province of Kai, it’s a different story.\n\nVOLCANOES\n\nThere are 285 volcanoes throughout the Japanese islands. Many of the mountains of Japan are actually volcanoes that may erupt at any time. There are 36 active volcanoes in Japan. Most are only dormant. Even the famous Mount Fuji is a natural disaster waiting to happen. (In Japanese, Mount Fuji is called Fujisan. Please don’t ever say Fujiyama. Fujiyama is a different mountain.) An eruption could last days or even weeks. It isn’t a continual flow, but a cycle of belching and flowing, then quiet, and more activity. Fissures, or chimneys, could open up far away from the crater itself, which send more burning lava down the mountainside. In addition to lava flows and explosive eruptions, a danger with volcanoes is pyroclastic flow, which is a sudden expulsion from the volcano of heavy, hot, toxic gasses which flow down the mountain (usually with smoke and lava, but sometimes without), frying and killing everything it touches. No one knows when a pyroclastic flow will happen, but it usually occurs only during an eruption period. Mercifully, eruptions are very, very rare.\n\nEARTHQUAKES\n\nThe land is also prone to earthquakes, ranging from small tremors to huge, castle-devouring monsters. Note that in real life, the earth does not gape open, swallow people, and close up again, squashing them. Fissures might open up, but only if the earthquake is in cavernous or mined territories. The risk in earthquakes\n\n24\n\nis in being flattened by falling debris, or being caught in a burning structure and turning into a fricassee. This is how most people in Japan are killed by earthquakes, since the buildings are predominantly wooden and paper constructs, and even the solid walls are usually built over wooden lathe. If one is out in the open during an earthquake, one should simply plant one’s feet firmly and enjoy the ride. There are two types of earthquake: the swaying earthquake and the bouncing earthquake. If the ground is swaying side to side, its not as serious or dangerous as those that can be recognized by a pounding sensation in the ground. If one feels an earthquake, the first thing one should do is quickly identify sway or bounce. If it’s a bouncer, get underneath something solid or stand in a doorway. And watch for falling timbers and roof tiles. Unfortunately, earthquakes are very, very common. So many happen, in fact, that people might not even notice most of them, so minor and subtle are they.\n\nWEATHER\n\nSince we have to have a basis somewhere, we are using Edo as the Japanese standard. It is geographically near the middle of the country, so you can assume a higher temperature in the south and lower temperature in the north. The rainfall is fairly consistent. The rainfall in September and October in Edo is phenomenal; four or five inches a day. Kagoshima, farther to the south, is hit by monsoons earlier, and June and July are wetter than in Edo. The hottest month of the year is August, where the temperature in Edo averages 85°F (29.5°C). In Kagoshima, it is around 88°. In January, Edo temperatures drop to 48° (8.9°C), and in Kagoshima to 54° (12.2°C). Despite the seeming warmth, it snows in Miyako during the winter, and in Edo as well. There are usually at least two good snowfalls that really slow down life in the cities, and often quite a few more. Those cities and monasteries at higher altitudes, such as Kôfu (the principal city in Kai) and Hiezan, suffer much more snowfall. For average precipitation and temperatures in Japan throughout the year, see the almanac in Daily Life in Japan.\n\nThree times a year one should have an able and honest retainer go around the province, listen to the opinions of the four classes of people*, and devise some policy in regard to those opinions. Moreover, the master should also change his appearance a bit and make such an inspection for himself. — Asakura Toshikage (* samurai, farmers, artisans and merchants)\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nMANNERS & CUSTOMS\n\n25\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION This chapter contains a great deal of background information on the etiquette and social niceties of the Japan in which your SENGOKU campaign takes place. It is not exclusively reference material, however: game material and game mechanics also appear, so you will want to pay particular attention as you read for notices of what actually affects the running of the game itself, rather than just the background.\n\nETIQUETTE\n\nIt has been said that an armed society is a polite society. Feudal Japan is very well armed. As important as status and position are to the Japanese, etiquette is the grease that allows the wheels of society to turn. The lowerranked one is, the more fawning his manners will appear as higher and higher ranks are being addressed and interacted with. Virtually all forms of social interactions will take one of three clear patterns: to one’s superiors, to one’s equals, and to one’s inferiors. If a low-ranking samurai deals with an equal, he will function on an equal level unless he is hoping for a favor, in which case he would behave in the inferior-to-superior manner. Were he to behave in the superior-to-inferior manner, it would be either insulting or humorous, depending on situation and intent. If the same low-ranking samurai were to use equal-to-equal manners and speech to his lord, it would be a shocking example of lèse majesté—the servant would be declaring his equality with the master—and could get him severely reprimanded or even killed.\n\nBOWING\n\nBowing is the standard greeting and farewell, and depending on the depth of the bow and its duration, one can immediately tell who is the superior and who is the inferior. Equals and friends may bow with little more than an inclination of the head informally, but as with all things, a formal situation requires formal behavior. The most reverential form of bowing is a prostration, with one’s forehead touching the ground (sometimes referred to by its Chinese name, “kow-towing”). Usually this would only be used at court, or when summoned by one’s lord, although a peasant be-\n\n26\n\ning addressed by someone of very high rank (such as a well-placed samurai, or daimyô) may do this, and then carry on his conversation with the lord from a kneeling position. If one has committed some error, he will apologize by bowing in this manner to the one he has offended; it is a sort of “get out of jail free” card if done sincerely, as a proper bow and apology always gets a higher reaction from the one being apologized to than if the person just stands there and says, “Sorry.”\n\nSPEECH\n\nThe language itself is a barometer of social standing. Japanese has several different “politeness levels” with which one can speak. There are even certain verbs that are only used for different people. For example, when common people (or equals) eat, they will taberu; when someone more important than you eats, he will meshiagaru. When an equal does something, we say suru (do); when a superior does something, the verb is nasaru, and when it is an inferior, it is itasu. To these specialized vocabulary elements can be attached myriad forms of verbal endings, and to these can be married the various forms of simple pronouns. The result is a wonderful patchwork that can in a few words tell you everything you need to know about who is who. In the English vernacular—with which we assume you will be roleplaying the game—such subtle nuances are literally impossible to get across. There are a few ways to convey the idea, however. When addressing a superior, a character should use as polite a speech pattern as possible. Refer to superiors in the third person, not the second (e.g., “Would your lordship allow his servant to undertake this assignment?” versus, “Let me go!”). Players are free, of course, to forego this level of detail entirely, but it does help to simulate the “feel” of the culture in which they’ll be playing.\n\nINDOORS\n\nWhen going indoors, one removes his footwear before stepping up to the wooden or tatami-clad flooring. To fail to do so is insulting, to say nothing of just plain unclean. There are usually servants at side entrances with zori or geta, so if you are to take a walk in the garden, to an outhouse, or off to the tea pavilion, you need not be concerned about having left your footwear on the other side of the building. Even inns will have pairs of zori or geta at various entrances for the convenience of their guests.\n\nThe basic meaning of etiquette is to be quick at both the beginning and end and tranquil in the middle. — Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nGiven the nature of the interior walls—usually paper on wooden lattice—sound travels. It is thus rude to be loud or boisterous. It is also poor taste to be seen to be listening in on a conversation in another room, although it would be hard not to hear it.\n\nAUDIENCES\n\nWhen having an audience with a lord or other important personage, there will be guards present (although they may be hiding behind wall partitions). One should always bow formally to the lord at such a meeting, and sit on the floor several feet away. There may or may not be a cushion to sit on. Don’t count on it. When indoors, the lord holding the audience will invariably sit on a dais at one end of the room, and anyone else will be on the floor. Outdoors, if a formal audience is being conducted, there will be a tatami platform or a camp chair on which the lord will sit, in front of a semi-circle of camp-curtains bearing the lord’s crest. Watch the film Kagemusha; there are several different and excellent examples of audiences in it. Sometimes, the person holding court will sit on his verandah, and the people in attendance will sit below on the ground. This is more typical for a larger group, when a single room might not hold everyone who needs to be there.\n\nDRESS AND APPEARANCE\n\nThe weaving loom is in widespread use by clothiers, and has been in use since as far back as he Yayoi period (c. 300 BC to AD 300). By the Nara period (8th century), refined weaving techniques, introduced from China and Korea, were in widespread use. Woven cotton was introduced in the 15th century and became popular with the lower classes. For common people of Sengoku Japan, clothing is usually of cotton, hemp or even nettle fibers; upper classes wear silk as well. Silk is made in Japan as well as imported from China. Dyeing of material is accomplished using natural dyes from plants and minerals. The three methods are the batique technique, stencils, and tie-dyeing. Colors run the gamut from various earthtones to bright jewel colors and pastels. Brocades and printed patterns are also commonly found. Older people wear darker, more subdued colors, while younger people wear brighter, more gaudy clothing. White is the color of death; people on their way to die will wear white, and people being prepared for funerals will be dressed in white as well. Clothing is tied on or belted in place; there are very few instances in clothing of buttons being used (one is to hold the collar closed on a kimono worn under armor). In rainy weather, upper-classes will make use of oiled paper umbrellas. The lower classes (and samurai on the march) wear raincoats of straw. All classes wear tall geta, if they can afford them, to keep their feet out of the mud and puddles.\n\nMany men also wrap a long cloth around their abdomens. This cloth, slightly wider than a shaku and as many as nine shaku in length, is called a haramaki. It serves to keep the belly warmer, and is often worn even in the summer under the rest of the man’s clothing. The belief is that if the belly is kept warm and secure, the person will be healthy. Women of the upper-classes wear a red apron called a mô instead of any more binding undergarment.\n\nKimono\n\nAlthough the word kimono means “thing to wear” and can, in a sense, refer to any item of clothing, it means… well, kimono. Kimono are always worn with the left side wrapped over right; wrapping the kimono right over left was how the dead were dressed. The briefest and lightest kimono is called a jûban, and functions like a twentieth-century T-shirt. It is usually a plain, undyed hemp or cotton (or silk for the upper classes). Both men and women wear them, only the cut is slightly different. Beyond this, most garments worn by women are variants of the kimono proper; sleeve size, fullness, length—all these vary, but the general cut is the same. For men, only the under-classes generally stopped with the kimono; a variety of vests, over-robes, and coats were worn over the kimono. The cut, fabric, and decoration serve to set the ranks apart when it comes to kimono. The upper classes had silk and hemp and cotton, while the lower classes didn’t have access to the silk.\n\nFoundation\n\nThe universal male undergarment is the fundoshi (loincloth), a long, narrow cloth which wraps up between the legs and around the lower torso. Men undergoing arduous work such as farming, woodcutting, or construction might wear nothing but a loincloth and a headband, especially if the weather is oppressively hot and humid. The fundoshi also serves as a garment for swimming.\n\nEven if you are aware that you may be struck down today and are firmly resolved to an inevitable death, if you are slain with an unseemly appearance, you will show your lack of previous resolve, will be despised by your enemy, and will appear unclean. For this reason it is said that both old and young should take care of their appearance. — Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n\n27\n\nSENGOKU: REVISED EDITION\n\nMen\n\nMen of the upper classes will invariably wear hakama (culottes-like trousers) with their kimono, even when lounging at home. Over this hakama and kimono combination, a buke who is lounging may add a dôbuku, which is a large, broad-sleeved coat similar to a happi. Standard wear for middleand lower-rank buke is the kamishimo, a garment consisting of a matching hakama and a sleeveless, sideless vest (called a kataginu), worn over a kimono. In the film Shôgun, many such example of kamishimo can be seen. A more formal outfit is the suô or hitatare, which is a kamishimo to whose kataginu huge, free-flowing sleeves have been attached. An eboshi (cloth cap) of some sort is typically worn by those of rank. The armor under-robe is essentially a hitatare with closer-fitted sleeves. These large sleeves have ties at the wrists to enable the wearer to tie them closed so they will not get in his way. Any of these garments may be decorated simply or elaborately with the owner’s or wearer’s clan crest. When wearing armor, one may wear a hitatare over the armor; in this case, the sleeves are tied closed at the elbow (so that they balloon out slightly), and the hakama is worn over the cuirass skirtplates. This outfit presents a very martial appearance. Kuge wear a kariginu instead. A kariginu is a high- and roundcollared over-robe with large sleeves. It is worn over the hakama. The kanmuri (cap of rank) is usually worn with a kariginu, especially in formal occasions. In the most formal of settings, kuge will wear a sokutai, a heavy, black courtrobe. In less formal conditions, a kuge man will wear a garment called a suikan, which is almost identical in cut to a kariginu, but it is worn inside the hakama, and with the collar open and tied back. Bonge and hinin might wear short kimono only, with no pants, if the weather is warm. They may also wear cloth leggings around their shins. In cold weather, they will add trousers of similar cut to the hakama, but tighter and less wasteful of fabric. The outfit is similar to a twentieth-century jûdô gi.\n\n28\n\nBuddhist priests typically wear a simple kimono with a saffron kesa, a long cloth wrap worn over one shoulder. Not all buke shave their heads and wear the topknot. There are two varieties of topknot; one is the tea-whisk style (usually worn with a full head of hair), which just gathers the hair up straight and tight in a ribbon and lets the end splay out like a tea-whisk; the other calls for a small knot of ribbon at the top of the back of the head and lets the hair fall forward slightly. There is, as yet, nothing like the later Edo (Tokugawa period) hairstyle which has a shaven pate and a long queue of oiled hair folded forward over it. When donning armor for battle, bushi let their hair down, and leave it loose under the helmet. Men of the upper classes wear tabi (split-toed socks) of either deerskin or cotton, and waraji (straw sandals). Those of the lowerclasses make do without the tabi except during winter. Geta are not worn except at home in the garden during inclement weather. Zori are the more common alternative footwear. Since Japanese clothing has no pockets, anything that needs to be carried is carried in the front flap of the kimono, or in the hanging sleeves. In the flap, a man will usually carry an ogi (folding fan), several sheets of paper (useful for writing, or for “personal business”) and possibly a wallet.\n\nWomen\n\nWomen of the kuge have had their teeth blackened and eyebrows shaved, and a tiny black dot of fake eyebrow was painted high on their foreheads; this is a mark of refined, quiet living. The women of the highest ranking buke have adopted this practice to an extent, although most buke considered it an affectation. Some men among the kuge even blacken their teeth to appear elegant, but in this case there is also a sense of the effete about the practice, and to most buke it just seems odd. Upper-class women—both buke and kuge—wear their hair long, and tie it once at the base of the skull with a ribbon and let it hang loose. Court dress for kuge and buke women is an ancient garment called a jûni-hitoe. The term means “12-layered garment,” and although that may be a slight exaggeration, there are indeed several layers—eight to ten—of robes worn one on top of the other. The colors and patterns coordinate as to season, and it is a mark of a woman’s esthetic abilities that she makes no gaffes in choosing her apparel for the day. The jûni-hitoe is bulky and hot, and women wearing it are severely restricted in their range of motion. While they look stunning, they are prisoners of their own clothing. Commonly, they will wear one- or two-layered and belted kimono with an over kimono (which is unbelted) as a sort of jacket. When they go outside, they will use this unbelted kimono as a sort of hat, holding it above their heads. This serves to keep the sun out of their eyes, and keeps their skin pale. It also keeps prying eyes from seeing who is stepping out. An alternative is a low,\n\nAn affected laugh shows lack of self-respect in a man and lewdness in a woman. — Yamamoto Jinzaemon\n\nWWW.SENGOKU.COM\n\nSake\n\nbroad conical hat of woven straw, from which hangs a curtain of gauze. Common women wear but one kimono and an undergarment, unless their occupational requirements (e.g., geisha or courtesans) call for something else. Like upper-class women, they wear their hair long, but not as long, and often they have caught it up on their heads with a comb. The huge bows and ornately decorated obi commonly seen in the twentieth century does not appear in Sengoku Japan.\n\nSake dates back to the 3rd century, originating from a type of sake called kuchikami no sake, or “chewing-in-themouth sake.” Kuchikami no sake was made the way you might imagine; Chestnuts and millet would be chewed by the whole village and then spat out into a tub to ferment. In Sengoku Japan, sake is the omnipresent beverage, and there is a bewildering variety of types. There are sweet sake, ceremonial sake, thick sake full of lees, dry sake, and so on. Contrary to popular opinion, not all sake is meant to be drunk warm; some sake are actually better—and should be served—chilled. Sake is drunk out of low, broad cups called sakazuki, although more than one serious drinker of sake—when he has finished his soup— has converted the soup bowl into a sake cup. It is considered very poor taste to drink directly from the sake flask or jar. A servant or a neighboring companion pours the drinks. One should never pour his own. Is it rude to pour your own? No; it’s Just The Way Things Are. Only those who are crude and crass, drunk, or truly at ease with each other, will dispense with the pouring rituals. Sake is brewed in the winter. Many large farms brew their own sake as an off-season occupation. Smaller farms may brew their own sake for personal use and for offering to guests. The quality is generally not as good as that of large, professional brewers, but on a cold winter day or evening, a warm cup of sake can taste very good and warm the belly regardless of its origin. Sake merchants in towns are also known to be moneylenders, and have the reputation of usurers.\n\nTea\n\nTea, or cha, is a common beverage as well, and is served in larger cups, piping hot. Note that this is different from the tea used in the Cha-no-yu, or Tea Ceremony. Common tea is just a warm beverage; that is a ritual.\n\nDINING AND DRINKING\n\nDining is done in whatever room serves the purpose; there are no set dining rooms or banquet halls in Japanese homes or estates. Each place setting is prepared on an individual table slightly larger than one shaku square. Rather than a single large plate, each item of food gets its own plate. Often, the plates have specialized functions; this plate is used only for fish, that plate exclusively for pickles, etc. A bowl of rice accompanies every meal. This bowl may be refilled as many times as necessary from a large tub. One should never, ever, stick his ohashi (chopsticks) into the rice bowl so that they are standing up; that is how one offers rice to the dead and is an omen of very bad luck. Dining is done with ohashi. Bowls and plates of food are brought close to the mouth and food is delivered with the ohashi. While spoons exist, soups are drunk from the bowl rather than ladled out a mouthful at a ti"
