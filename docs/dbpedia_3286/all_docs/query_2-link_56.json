        "text": "Issue(s): Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #12, Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #13, Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #14, Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #15\n\nCover Date: Nov 77 - Feb 78\n\nTitle: \"Brother Power, Sister Sun!\" / \"...The coming of Razorback!\" / \"Killing me softly... with his hate!\" / \"The final rage!\"\n\nCredits:\n\nBill Mantlo - Writer\n\nArchie Goodwin - Plot on #12 and #15\n\nSal Buscema - Penciler\n\nMike Esposito / Ernie Chan - Inker\n\nReview/plot:\n\nThere's been a subplot about Sha Shan running back to issue #3 of this series. And it's finally resolved in these issues. I'm being a bit generous calling it a subplot; after seeing Sha Shan run from Flash Thompson in issue #3, the story devoted to Sha Shan basically amounted to someone saying, \"Hey, don't forget we've got a Sha Shan story going on!\", although in issue #8 Flash did learn that she was married to the restaurant owner she's been working for.\n\nThe story ranges from weird to strange. Sha Shan, it turns out, is in a cult called the Legion of Light with her husband. He's Brother Power, and she's Sister Sun.\n\nAnd their cult leader turns out to be the Hate-Monger...\n\n...who turns out to actually be the Man-Beast.\n\nAdd to that the fact that Spider-Man is helped out by a new super-hero, the CB-loving, pig-suit wearing Razorback.\n\nI am told that if you've ever used an expression like LOL, or used an emoticon, you're not allowed to make fun of Razorback's CB radio jargon. But i've never worn a pig costume, so i'm gonna go ahead and laugh at Razorback anyway. RMFAO!\n\nAmong Razorback's many assets are his not-as-strong-as-Spidey super-strength, his electrified mane...\n\n...and the ability to summon Big Pig, his souped-up truck, by pushing a button on his belt.\n\nActually, my favorite scene in this arc, sincerely, is when it takes Spider-Man multiple tries to push the button on Razorback's belt while they are chained to a wall by the Man-Beast.\n\nThe fact that it's a difficult shot really comes across, and the fact that Buscema and Mantlo would devote the space to showing it is illustrative of the decompression that's been happening naturally since the Silver Age.\n\nWhen Spider-Man first meets Razorback he assumes he's working for Brother Power, so they get into a fight, and Razorback is happy to oblige, since he's heard that all heroes get into Misunderstanding Fights when they first meet.\n\nHe's involved because his sister, whose name just had to be Bobby Sue, has also fallen into the cult.\n\nThe story ends in a big showdown at a televised event at a sports arena (and no, the Man-Beast isn't getting a perm).\n\nI'm not sure what ethnicity Brother Power - real name Achmed Korba - is supposed to be. You would assume Vietnamese since he's married to Sha Shan and his origin is that he ran a restaurant in Saigon during the Vietnam war that was a front for illegal activities and eventually he ran into the Man-Beast, who gave him his powers.\n\nBut Achmed Korba doesn't seen like a Vietnamese name. His appearance and accent has totally changed since his first appearance, as well (compare to the restaurant scene in issue #3). Obviously he didn't have to be native to Vietnam to run a restaurant there, or his parents could have emigrated there, or whatever.\n\nAs to how Sha Shan got mixed up in all of this, it has something to do with balance.\n\nIt's really Sha Shan's involvement in this story that, for me, makes it go from \"Yeah, ok, whatever, standard super-hero fight\" to \"Huh?!\". Well that, and Razorback.\n\nBut, like, her obligation to join the cult isn't really compelling (because honor!), and whatever role her father thought she would play doesn't really seem to happen and Mantlo is forced to squeeze in a few lines of dialogue explaining why she was important.\n\nRazorback actually has a significant number of subsequent appearances, although granted they are almost exclusively in the satirical She-Hulk book.\n\nQuality Rating: D\n\nHistorical Significance Rating: 3 - first Razorback\n\nChronological Placement Considerations: Spider-Man hurt his shoulder in Amazing Spider-Man #173 and it heals in ASM #176. This arc starts with Peter testing his shoulder on a tennis court with Flash Thompson, so it needs to take place after ASM #176-180.\n\nReferences:\n\nFlash Thompson found out that Sha Shan was married to Achmed Korba (Brother Power) in Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #8.\n\nSpider-Man's shoulder was injured in Amazing Spider-Man #173.\n\nSha Shan was first seen in Amazing Spider-Man #108-109.\n\nThe first Hate-Monger, Adolf Hitler, has generally been thought dead since Fantastic Four #21.\n\nFlash Thompson is actively involved in the attack on the Legion of Light cult, and he thinks to himself that he can handle it since he took on Dr. Doom in Amazing Spider-Man #5.\n\nThe first clue that the Hate-Monger isn't the original is when Spider-Man is surprised that he breaks out of Spidey's webbing even quicker than the Hulk would have, and the Hate-Monger responds that the Hulk couldn't best him, and neither can Spider-Man. The Man-Beast fought the Hulk in Hulk #176-178.\n\nThe Man-Beast describes how he screwed up the High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth in Marvel Premiere #1.\n\nCrossover: N/A\n\nContinuity Insert? N"
