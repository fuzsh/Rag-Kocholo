        "text": "This is a continuation of observations on films I’ve seen this year. The sub-goals are 5 films with Michelle Williams, 5 films with Casey Affleck (I’ve been slacking with watching more recent work so picking these two seems like a … Continue reading →\n\nIf I had written Spider-Man 3, it would have ended with a few unresolved cliffhangers. Spider-Man and Mary Jane are worried because Harry Osborn is on the loose as the new Green Goblin. They’re unaware that Eddie Brock, a suicidal … Continue reading →\n\nAnd I also read some Spider-Man comics in March. Venom #32: Solid mostly self-contained issue as Flash Thompson gets used to his new life in Philadelphia, and fights a mostly generic villain, while Bunn and co. lay the seeds for the battle … Continue reading →\n\nIt’s worth looking at the histories of Venom and Carnage, as it’s something that writers and editors can learn from. It provides a model of how the company responded to two breakout villains, the mistakes they made and the things … Continue reading →\n\nWhen deciding the ideal direction of the Spider-Man titles, there isn’t much of a point to making declarations about most of the villains. I’d rather Doctor Octopus not be killed off, but it ultimately doesn’t matter. He’s replaceable, as are … Continue reading →\n\nWas Joe Quesada a hypocrite for Spider-Man: One More Day considering other developments, like Mac Gargan becoming Venom, or Aunt May learning Peter’s secret identity? Continue reading →\n\nSince One More Day, some readers came to the understanding that Peter Parker won’t get the girl, be it Mary Jane or anyone else. I didn’t think much of it. The logic behind the decision was that there are more … Continue reading →\n\nI’m ambivalent on the question of whether Ben Reilly should be resurrected. In superhero comics, there are ways to circumvent a character dissolving into dust. That’s not the problem. It could always be revealed that another clone, or an entity … Continue reading →\n\nI’d say there’s a new suspect for the villain of The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Morbius, the Living Vampire. A few weeks ago, Stan Lee said that Morbius was one villain he would like to see on film. It’s a slightly unusual answer … Continue reading →\n\nThere’s a flaw with my hunch that Sony’s going to use the next Spider-Man film to adapt the Ultimate Venom saga. It means that significant chunks of every film in the new trilogy will be spent revisiting things that viewers … Continue reading →"
