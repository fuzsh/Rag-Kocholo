This version is an alternate personality of Norman's who occasionally takes over to commit crimes. Osborn also has a niece, Mona Osborn (voiced by Sally Julian), who was unaware of her uncle's double life. Following a plane crash, the Goblin resurfaces, kidnaps Mona, and forces her to help him find his formula so he can transform New York's population into goblins. However, Norman is eventually cured by lightning and sent back to a medical institute.\n\nSpider-Man: The Animated Series (1994–1998)\n\nedit\n\nThe Norman and Harry Osborn incarnations of the Green Goblin appear in Spider-Man: The Animated Series, voiced again by Neil Ross and Gary Imhoff, respectively.[2][3]\n\nThe series' version of Norman is the owner of OsCorp Industries, a weapons manufacturing company under the influence of the Kingpin, whom Norman later attempts to assassinate via the Hobgoblin, and displays a vendetta against Spider-Man. Norman eventually becomes the first Green Goblin following a gas accident at OsCorp that causes him to develop an alternate, more violent, and chaotic personality. Using an altered version of the Hobgoblin suit, the Goblin targets Norman's rivals, but is defeated by Spider-Man, though his identity remains a secret and Norman lacks memory of the Goblin's actions. The Goblin eventually resurfaces to eliminate Spider-Man, the Kingpin, and the Hobgoblin. In pursuit of this, he obtains a time dilation accelerator and, after learning Spider-Man's secret identity, kidnaps Mary Jane Watson who falls into a dimensional portal opened by the accelerator. After the Goblin ends up falling into a similar portal, he becomes trapped in Limbo.\n\nThe series' version of Harry is Peter Parker's best friend, though he grows jealous of him after Parker begins dating Watson. Following Norman and Watson's disappearances, Harry becomes furious with Spider-Man, whom he blames for the incident, and is eventually driven insane and begins having hallucinations of the Goblin, who offers to tell him where his father is if he kills Spider-Man. Harry becomes the second Green Goblin to exact revenge on the web-slinger, but is defeated by Spider-Man and the Punisher and sent to Ravencroft, where he receives medical treatment for his insanity. After Watson returns, Harry escapes and crashes her and Parker's wedding, demanding that she marry him instead. However, Liz Allan reveals her hidden feelings for Harry and convinces him that his friends care about him as well. Harry surrenders and returns to Ravencroft to continue his treatment.\n\nAn alternate universe variant of Norman Osborn / Green Goblin appears in the two-part series finale \"Spider Wars\". In an alternate reality where Spider-Carnage destroyed New York, the Goblin became one of his enforcers, only to be defeated by a number of Spider-Men from across the multiverse.\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited (1999–2001)\n\nedit\n\nA Counter-Earth incarnation of the Green Goblin appears in Spider-Man Unlimited (1999), voiced by Rino Romano. This version is Hector Jones, a heroic figure; ally of the Rejects, a group of Bestials who the High Evolutionary deemed useless and abandoned; and a member of a rebellion that fights to liberate Counter-Earth from the High Evolutionary's tyranny. Additionally, Jones uses a winged backpack for traversal instead of a goblin glider. During his first encounter with Spider-Man who came to Counter-Earth to rescue John Jameson, the Goblin mistakes him for a villain and attacks him until he learns the web-slinger is also a hero on his home planet. The pair befriend each other and team up several times throughout the series.\n\nSpider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003)\n\nedit\n\nHarry Osborn appears in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series, voiced by Ian Ziering. This version is blonde and Peter Parker's best friend who despises Spider-Man, blaming him for his father's death prior to the series. However, Harry shows signs of beginning to put the grudge aside in later episodes.\n\nNorman Osborn is alluded to several times, making cameo appearances via Harry's hallucinations and in a photograph. Sometime prior to the series, he operated as the Green Goblin before he was killed in battle against Spider-Man, with only the web-slinger being aware of his alter-ego.\n\nThe Spectacular Spider-Man (2008–2009)\n\nedit\n\nThe Norman Osborn incarnation of the Green Goblin and Harry Osborn appear in The Spectacular Spider-Man, voiced by Alan Rachins, Steve Blum, and James Arnold Taylor respectively.[2][3][4]\n\nThe series' version of Norman is Oscorp's cold and calculating head who is known to never apologize and has a strained relationship with his son. In the first season, he is hired by Tombstone to create supervillains to distract Spider-Man from Tombstone's criminal activities. Norman later assumes the Goblin alias after enhancing himself with the \"Gobulin Green\" formula and masquerading as a mysterious criminal equipped with stolen Oscorp technology who seeks to overthrow Tombstone as New York's reigning crime boss. The Goblin battles Spider-Man twice before fleeing to secretly frame Harry, using his son's addiction to further the lie. In the second season, Norman hires Dr. Miles Warren to work at Empire State University's labs and begins to mentor Peter Parker. After Tombstone, Silvermane, and Doctor Octopus are all arrested by Spider-Man, the Goblin resurfaces as the second \"Big Man of Crime\". Following two failed attempts to kill Spider-Man, Norman hires the Chameleon to pose as him while he faces the web-slinger one more time as the Goblin. In the ensuing fight, Norman is unmasked and reveals he framed Harry to protect himself and Harry before he is seemingly killed by a hidden cache of pumpkin bombs. However, Norman is later shown to have survived and leaves New York under a false identity.\n\nThe series' version of Harry is Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy's best friend who longs to impress his father. In the first season, the stress and constant disappointment in his life prompt him to steal \"Gobulin Green\", Oscorp's experimental formula that increases his self-esteem and aggressiveness. He is later framed as the Goblin, taken on a tour of Europe to overcome his addiction, and promises Spider-Man not to be the Goblin again in exchange for the web-slinger protecting his apparent secret. In the second season, Harry begins dating Stacy and later helps Spider-Man unmask Norman as the real supervillain. After Norman is seemingly killed in battle against Spider-Man, Harry vows revenge for his father.\n\nUltimate Spider-Man (2012–2017)\n\nedit\n\nSeveral depictions of the Green Goblin appear in Ultimate Spider-Man (2012):\n\nNorman Osborn (voiced by Steven Weber[5][2][6][7]) is Oscorp's manipulative CEO and the estranged father of Harry. In the first season, he employs Doctor Octopus to aid him in his plot to obtain Spider-Man's DNA and create a \"spider-soldier\" army. After Doc Ock's work results in the Venom symbiote's creation and bonding to Harry, Norman considers using his son to further his plans. However, Doc Ock betrays Norman by injecting him with a serum mixed with Spider-Man and Venom's DNA, transforming him into the Green Goblin. After stealing a glider and pumpkin bombs, among other technology, from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, the Goblin tries to have Venom join him, but fails and resolves to take the symbiote from Harry before escaping. In the second season, the Goblin returns to kidnap Parker and inject him with a symbiote sample, turning Parker into Carnage to kill Spider-Man. However, Harry and Venom defeat the Goblin, forcing him to flee. The Goblin later allows himself to be captured and taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new Tri-Carrier so he can infect everyone aboard with the symbiote, briefly turning himself into Venom to combat Spider-Man once more until Doc Ock creates a cure for the symbiote infection, restoring Norman's human form in the process. Following this, the remorseful Norman attempts to make amends as the anti-hero Iron Patriot and fights alongside Spider-Man's team, but Doc Ock turns Norman back into the Goblin, who attempts to turn all of New York into goblins as well before Spider-Man thwarts his plans and captures him. In the third season, the Goblin is unintentionally released during a battle between the New Warriors and Taskmaster's Thunderbolts and steals the Siege Perilous. After trapping Electro in it to use him as a power source, he opens a portal to the multiverse, steals DNA samples from various alternate reality versions of Spider-Man, and uses them to mutate himself into the Spider-Goblin. While fighting his version of Spider-Man, the Goblin reveals he deduced the web-slinger's identity. Nonetheless, he is defeated by the alternate reality Spider-Men and turns back to normal, losing his memory in the process. Additionally, Nightmare showcases a dream of an alternate future where Parker stopped being Spider-Man which resulted in Norman mutating further as the Goblin King, killed most of Earth's heroes, and took their weapon as trophies. As of the fourth season, Norman has inoculated himself with an anti-Goblin serum to prevent future transformations, re-adopts his Iron Patriot alias, and becomes an ally to Spider-Man once more. In the series finale, it is revealed Norman recovered his memories, but chose to keep Spider-Man's identity secret out of respect.\n\nA female alternate universe variant of Norman named Norma Osborn (voiced by Wendie Malick) wears a variation of the traditional Green Goblin costume coupled with gauntlets like the \"prime\" variant and serves as the archenemy of Petra Parker / Spider-Girl. When the aforementioned \"prime\" Goblin visits her universe, they join forces to destroy their respective versions of Spider-Man, only for Norma to be defeated while Norman escapes to another reality.\n\nHarry Osborn (voiced by Matt Lanter[6][3]) is Peter Parker's best friend, Norman's estranged son, a student at Midtown High School, and a friend of Mary Jane Watson and Flash Thompson. During the first two seasons, Harry is the Venom symbiote's first and primary host and fights Spider-Man and his allies several times before eventually rejecting Venom's control. He also mends his relationship with Norman after his father is restored to normal. After making minor appearances in the third season, Harry joins Spider-Man in fighting crime in the fourth season as the superhero Patrioteer and temporarily forced as the Anti-Venom symbiote's host to save Manhattan from Carnage before joining the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy in the series finale.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel incarnation (also voiced by Steven Weber[8]) appears in the third and fourth seasons. This version sports demonic wings. Following an encounter and fight with the \"prime\" Spider-Man and Miles Morales / Kid Arachnid, Doctor Octopus brings this variant of the Goblin to the \"prime\" universe to recruit him into the Hydra-backed Sinister Six, though they are defeated.\n\nSpider-Man (2017–2020)\n\nedit\n\nHarry and Norman Osborn appear in Marvel's Spider-Man (2017), voiced by Max Mittelman[9][3][10] and Josh Keaton[11][2][12][13] respectively.\n\nThe series' version of Harry (with elements of Phil Urich) is the creator of Goblin technology, which he eventually uses to fight crime as the superhero Hobgoblin. Additionally, he is Peter Parker's best friend, a student at Horizon High, later the Osborn Academy, and a friend to Miles Morales / Ultimate Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy / Ghost Spider, and Anya Corazon / Spider-Girl. In the first season, Harry views Spider-Man as a menace during their various encounters. While helping to create a cure for the Jackal's spider-virus, Harry discovers Parker is Spider-Man, which fractures their friendship. The former's views on the web-slinger are apparently confirmed after Spider-Man joins the Sinister Six, but Harry learns Spider-Man was brainwashed by Doctor Octopus and frees the former, mending their friendship in the process. Harry also learns Norman's true colors, subsequently choosing to support Spider-Man and disavowing his father. Afterwards, Harry becomes Oscorp's new CEO and continues to assist Spider-Man and the Spider Team combat various supervillains, such as the Goblin Nation in the second season and the Dark Goblin in the third season.\n\nThe series' version of Norman is Harry's strict father and Oscorp's original CEO with high expectations and a willingness to steal others' technology to pass off as his own. In the first season, he establishes the Osborn Academy for Geniuses after secretly causing Harry's suspension at Horizon High and to save his son from embarrassment while plotting against Spider-Man, Max Modell, and Professor Raymond Warren. After being exposed to the Jackal's spider-virus, he mutates into the Spider-King before he is cured by the Spider Team. Norman later entrusts Harry with killing Spider-Man so that his son will be New York's only protector. Harry refuses so Norman impersonates the Hobgoblin in an attempt to kill Spider-Man himself, ultimately confronting the web-slinger and Harry in his lab until he is seemingly killed in a chemical explosion. Norman returns in the third season as the Dark Goblin, having formulated a conspiracy that results in a symbiote invasion of Earth and turning the board of education against the web-slinger. However, the Spider Team expose his conspiracy and revert him to his human form before he is taken into custody.\n\nMarvel Super Hero Adventures\n\nedit\n\nThe Norman Osborn incarnation of the Green Goblin appears in Marvel Super Hero Adventures, voiced by Sam Vincent.[4]\n\nLego Marvel Spider-Man: Vexed by Venom\n\nedit\n\nThe Norman Osborn incarnation of the Green Goblin appears in Lego Marvel Spider-Man: Vexed by Venom, voiced by Josh Keaton.[4]\n\nSpidey and His Amazing Friends (2021)\n\nedit\n\nAn unidentified version of the Green Goblin appears in Spidey and His Amazing Friends, voiced by JP Karliak.
