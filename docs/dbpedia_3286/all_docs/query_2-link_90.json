        "text": "As it continues breaking new records daily, the film looks to be fast approaching the $1 billion mark worldwide.\n\nHype around the movie revolved around two things: the hotly-anticipated returns of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, as well as their official introduction into the MCU, plus numerous wacky cameos, including Channing Tatum as Gambit, Blake Lively as Lady Deadpool and Wesley Snipes as Blade.\n\nBut one of the most surprising cameos has to be Henry Cavill's, with the star appearing as a version of Wolverine.\n\nTaking to Instagram to address his cameo for the first time, Cavill recently shared an image of himself in character as The Cavillerine.\n\n\"To be safe, I shaved the moustache off for this one. Just the moustache. @SLevyDirect @VanCityReynolds @TheHughJackman #DeadpoolAndWolverine,\" he captioned the post, seemingly referencing the fact he couldn’t shave off his moustache when reshooting Justice League, as he had to keep it for his work on Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Instead, it was digitally removed in post production.\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about the cast, from MCU newcomers to actors from Fox’s X-Men and Deadpool, as well as for a list of the film's cameos (you'll need to scroll further down for this).\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine cast: Full list of actors and characters in Deadpool 3\n\nThe full cast list is as follows:\n\nRyan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool\n\nHugh Jackman as James \"Logan\" Howlett / Wolverine\n\nEmma Corrin as Cassandra Nova\n\nMatthew Macfadyen as Mr Paradox\n\nMorena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle\n\nRob Delaney as Peter\n\nLeslie Uggams as Blind Al\n\nKaran Soni as Dopinder\n\nBrianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead\n\nStefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus\n\nDafne Keen as Laura/X-23\n\nShioli Kutsuna as Yukio\n\nRandal Reeder as Buck\n\nLewis Tan as Shatterstar\n\nAaron Stanford as Pyro\n\nTyler Mane as Sabretooth\n\nJennifer Garner as Elektra Natchios\n\nPeggy the Dog as Dogpool\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about the actors and who they're playing.\n\nHugh Jackman plays Wolverine\n\nWho is Wolverine? A legend of the X-Men, Wolverine has been appearing in comic books since 1974. He's a mutant with ultra-keen senses, healing ability, and a skeleton enhanced with adamantium, which results in his signature retractable claws. He was last seen in the X-Men film Logan, which famously depicted his emotional death.\n\nHowever, Levy recently teased to RadioTimes.com how the movie gets round this. He said: \"As soon as Hugh said he was in, we knew that we had to protect Logan and we wanted to, frankly, acknowledge our reverence of that movie, not touch that ending, but also have some Deadpool audacious fun with it.\"\n\nLevy added: \"We acknowledge the events of Logan and we acknowledge the reverence for the movie Logan, and so I think it’s really clear that as a filmmaking team, there’s nothing but love and respect. But as a Deadpool movie, we are duty-bound to be subversive.\"\n\nWhere have I seen Hugh Jackman before? Aside from his role as Logan, Jackman is known for various roles across film including Jean Valjean in the 2017 version of Les Miserables, and PT Barnum in The Greatest Showman. In fact, it looks as though his role in The Greatest Showman is set to be referenced, due to one of the songs cropping up on the film's official soundtrack.\n\nEmma Corrin plays Cassandra Nova\n\nWho is Cassandra Nova? Cassandra is the twin sister of X-Men founder Charles Xavier. She is also a mummudrai, a parasitic life form born bodiless on the astral plane. In the comic books, Charles recognised his sister's evil presence and killed her, resulting in her being stillborn – however, the mummudrai that became Cassandra managed to adopt some of Charles's psionic powers and left her able to exit the womb and create a body for herself. Naturally, she then sought revenge on her brother. She's hell-bent on destruction and is set to cause havoc in the film.\n\nAs for what we can expect from Cassandra in Deadpool & Wolverine? Surprisingly, director Shawn Levy requested that Corrin did not think of her as a villain.\n\nCorrin told The Guardian: “I was, like, what? Are you serious? After all that?”\n\nInstead of a straight villain, Levy wanted Corrin to play Cassandra with unpredictability. Corrin has also said that Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka and Christoph Waltz’s portrayal of a Nazi officer in Inglourious Basterds were both references for the villain.\n\nWhere have I seen Emma Corrin before? Corrin is known for various roles in film and TV, including Princess Diana in season 4 of The Crown (a role which won them a Golden Globe), the films My Policeman and Lady Chatterley's Lover, and in the 2023 thriller miniseries A Murder at the End of the World.\n\nRyan Reynolds plays Wade Wilson/Deadpool\n\nWho is Wade Wilson/Deadpool? As the first film announced, Wade Wilson/Deadpool is \"God's Perfect Idiot\", an anti-hero with regenerative healing abilities. The wise-cracking anti-hero was previously in the Special Forces and, before taking on the Deadpool mantle, was an assassin for hire, although he's since begun to use his skills for (slightly) more honourable purposes. In Deadpool & Wolverine, we see a more emotional side of him.\n\nDirector Shawn Levy recently told RadioTimes.com that Reynolds's willingness to mock himself is key to the success of the Deadpool franchise.\n\nHe said: \"I think the key with the Deadpool franchise, starting with the main titles, from Deadpool 1 starring God’s perfect idiot, is if you’re willing to mock yourself, you have license to do so much and Ryan has always had that willingness to make fun of himself first and foremost.\"\n\nWhere have I seen Ryan Reynolds before? Aside from his role as Wade Wilson, Reynolds is known for films including Free Guy, Bullet Train, The Adam Project, and The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard.\n\nMorena Baccarin plays Vanessa Carlysle\n\nWho is Vanessa Carlysle? Vanessa is Wade's former fiancee. In Deadpool 2, Vanessa was shot and killed in a shock scene, but Wade was able to resurrect her after stealing Cable's Time Travel Device.\n\nWhere have I seen Morena Baccarin before? Baccarin is known for roles including Inara Serra in Firefly, Jessica Brody in Homeland, and Leslie Thompkins in Gotham.\n\nMatthew Macfadyen plays Mr Paradox\n\nWho is Mr Paradox? Mr Paradox is an agent at the Time Variance Authority who is overseeing a project to destroy the Earth-10005. He's hoping to become the leader of the TVA by proving himself – but it doesn't matter who he destroys on his way.\n\nMacfadyen recently told GamesRadar: “I wouldn’t call him a villain. I think he’s just a sort of I think he’s a terrible sort of apparatchik, who’s frustrated and disgruntled and probably is looking to improve his lot – and he has issues.”\n\nMacfadyen added to ScreenRant: “He works for the TVA obviously, and I think he’s probably a sort of mid-management, slightly frustrated man. I’m worrying about saying too much. Disney are very strict, but he’s got a sort of weird, angry, ugly energy to him, and he’s quite charming as well, so yeah, he’s an interesting character.”\n\nWhere have I seen Matthew Macfadyen before? Macfadyen is known for varied roles across film and TV, from Mr Darcy in Pride & Prejudice to Tom Wambsgans in HBO's Succession. He's also known for roles in Ripper Street, Spooks, and Operation Mincemeat.\n\nLeslie Uggams plays Blind Al\n\nWho is Blind Al? Blind Al is Wade's elderly roommate, a blind woman who puts up with none of his nonsense.\n\nWhere have I seen Leslie Uggams before? Early in her career, Uggams gained recognition for her role as Kizzy Reynolds in the miniseries Roots. As well as having an incredible career on stage, Uggams has appeared in Empire, Fallout, and the film American Fiction.\n\nKaran Soni plays Dopinder\n\nWho is Dopinder? Dopinder is a cab driver who became Deadpool's chauffeur and confidante.\n\nWhere have I seen Karan Soni before? Deadpool isn't Soni's only link to the MCU as he also previously voiced Pavitr Prabhakar / Spider-Man India in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. He's also appeared in the 2016 Ghostbusters film, in comedies like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Will & Grace, and in Abbott Elementary.\n\nBrianna Hildebrand plays Negasonic Teenage Warhead\n\nWho is Negasonic Teenage Warhead? Negasonic Teenage Warhead is a young mutant who can generate atomic bursts from her body. She and Colossus previously attempted to convince Deadpool to join the X-Men, with the anti-hero joining the pair of them on various missions.\n\nWhere have I seen Brianna Hildebrand before? Hildebrand is also known for her roles as Aurora in Lucifer and Elodie Davis in the show Trinkets.\n\nStefan Kapičić voices Colossus\n\nWho is Colossus? Colossus is a mutant and a member of the X-Men. Despite his super strength and being able to transform himself into metallic form, he's a quiet and good-natured character – and was convinced he could get Deadpool to join the X-Men.\n\nWhere have I seen/heard Stefan Kapičić before? Kapičić began his career working on Serbian films and, more recently, has appeared in Better Call Saul and Love, Death & Robots.\n\nDafne Keen as Laura/X-23\n\nWho is Laura/X23? Laura first appeared in 2017's Logan as a runaway mutant. Logan brings her to a scientist who explains that she was made from Wolverine's DNA, essentially making her his daughter. The film ends with Logan sacrificing himself so that Laura and the next generation of mutants can live. However, it seems the pair are now set to reunite.\n\nWhere have I seen Dafne Keen before? Keen is also known for roles including Lyra in His Dark Materials and Jecki Lon in The Acolyte.\n\nRob Delaney plays Peter\n\nWho is Peter? Peter is a human who managed to make his way onto Deadpool's X-Force team. Peter and Wade are set to grow closer in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nDelaney recently told RadioTimes.com: \"There's more Peter in this film than there was in the second one. [Wade and Peter] are very close - it's not a relationship of equals, Deadpool drives the motorcycle and Peter's in the side-car so to speak. But Deadpool leans on Peter and Peter really cares quite a bit about Deadpool – they have a nice friendship!\"\n\nLevy also teased that Peter's ending in the film changed from how it was originally written, telling us: \"There was a very small scene involving Peter towards the movie [that was cut] and we paid off Peter in a different way, ultimately, in the edit because we love us our Sugar Bear!\"\n\nWhere have I seen Rob Delaney before? Delaney rose to fame as an internet personality before securing his own show on Comedy Central. Aside from his role in the Deadpool films, he's appeared in films like Hobbs and Shaw, The Hustle and Bombshell.\n\nShioli Kutsuna plays Yukio\n\nWho is Yukio? Yukio is the girlfriend of Teenage Negasonic Warhead.\n\nWhere have I seen Shioli Kutsana before? Kutsana has also appeared in the film Murder Mystery, as well as the series Sanctuary and Invasion.\n\nAaron Stanford plays Pyro\n\nWho is Pyro? Pyro is a mutant who can control fire (although he can't generate his own). He's appeared in X-Men films from the first one onwards.\n\nWhere have I seen Aaron Stanford before? Stanford, who's portrayed Pyro since X2, also appeared as Doug in the 2006 remake of The Hills Have Eyes and as Birkhoff in Nikita.\n\nTyler Mane plays Sabretooth\n\nWho is Sabretooth? Sabretooth is a mutant with enhanced senses, razor-sharp claws, superhuman strength and reflexes, and regenerative healing abilities.\n\nWhere have I seen Tyler Mane before? Mane is a retired professional wrestler and is also known for roles including Ajax in Troy, and Michael Myers in the remake of Halloween.\n\nRandal Reeder as Buck\n\nWho is Buck? Buck is a friend of Wade Wilson's, from his days as an assassin.\n\nWhere have I seen Randal Reeder before? Reeder has previously had roles in the films Idiocracy and 21 Jump Street, and has appeared in series like Sons of Thunder.\n\nPeggy the Dog as Dogpool\n\nWho is Dogpool? Dogpool is set to be a canine variant of Deadpool.\n\nWhere have I seen Peggy before? Peggy rose to fame after winning the title of Britain's ugliest dog. Deadpool & Wolverine is her acting debut.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine cameos: Who shows up?\n\nWarning: Major spoilers ahead for the cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan\n\nBlake Lively as Lady Deadpool\n\nChanning Tatum as Gambit\n\nWesley Snipes as Blade\n\nChris Evans as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch\n\nHenry Cavill as a Wolverine variant\n\nMatthew McConaughey as Cowboy Deadpool\n\nWunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15/Verity Willis\n\nAlong the way, we also see various mutants including Juggernaut (not played by Vinnie Jones, who reportedly turned down the role), Azazel, Psylocke, Lady Deathstrike, Toad, Bullseye, and Quill.\n\nOf course, we also see a brief montage of Avengers including Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) and Hulk on screen in the TVA.\n\nPlus, it wouldn't be an MCU movie without a cameo from the late Stan Lee. The Marvel legend is seen on the side of a bus, advertising a company called Stanless Steelers.\n\nSpeaking of the cameos, director Levy recently told RadioTimes.com: \"I'm thrilled to say that some of them are not predicted on the internet.\n\n\"I think my favourite ones are really ones that are not cameos, they are characters. And they are in these supporting roles that we didn't show you so far [in the section of the film shown at preview events] that somehow the world doesn't know about yet.\"\n\nWesley Snipes plays Blade\n\nWho is Blade? Blade is a Marvel icon, a human with the powers of vampires. He had his own solo film in 1998, and the character is due to have a rebooted movie starring Mahershala Ali.\n\nSnipes's appearance as Blade has proven to be a record-breaking one, with the actor bagging the titles of Longest Career as a Live-Action Marvel Character and Longest Gap Between Character Appearances in Marvel Films in the Guinness World Records!\n\n\"I did not think it was possible,\" Snipes, who first took on the role in the 1998 movie of the same name before reprising it in 2002’s Blade II and 2004’s Blade: Trinity, said of his return.\n\nHe continued to Entertainment Weekly: \"I didn't think we would be able to pull it off. I didn't think that Marvel was into it, Disney was into it – also because they had Mahershala [Ali] cast for the next upcoming version of it… I thought it didn’t make sense to me, but [when] you get a call from Ryan Reynolds out of the blue after 20 years, you go, 'OK, I got to take this call. Let’s see what this is about.'\n\n\"He told me the idea… They said 'yes' and 'it’s a go'. 'If you’re in, we’re in.' Here we are.\"\n\nWhere have I seen Wesley Snipes before? Aside from his role as Blade, Snipes is known for films including Final Recall and Coming 2 America.\n\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan\n\nWho is Happy Hogan? The first cameo is a biggie, and someone we know well from the Avengers films – Happy Hogan! First appearing in the MCU as Tony Stark's driver, Happy's role has grown throughout the years, including as a liaison for Peter Parker (Tom Holland).\n\nWhere have I seen Jon Favreau before? Favreau has also appeared in films like Chef and The Wolf of Wall Street, and is an accomplished writer and director.\n\nBlake Lively plays Lady Deadpool\n\nWho is Lady Deadpool? Lady Deadpool is a female variant of Deadpool from Earth-3010. She was seen in trailers wearing a mask and with a blonde ponytail, leading fans to wonder whether Reynolds's wife Blake Lively would be playing her, whether Taylor Swift might make an appearance in the movie, or if Reynolds himself would play the character in a wig. As it turns out, it was Blake...although she never took off her mask!\n\nWhere have I seen Blake Lively before? While fans didn't quite see Lively in the film, she's recognisable for a host of other roles including Serena van der Woodson in Gossip Girl, Emily Nelson in A Simple Favor, and Bridget in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\n\nChanning Tatum plays Gambit\n\nWho is Gambit? Gambit is a mutant who can mentally create, control, and manipulate pure kinetic energy. The character was previously played by Taylor Kitsch, but had been linked to Channing Tatum for a solo film. The film was in development for years but never made it to release – so Deadpool & Wolverine marks the first time the actor has been able to play the role on screen.\n\nWhere have I seen Channing Tatum before? Tatum is known for roles including Magic Mike, and his roles in 21 and 22 Jump Street.\n\nJennifer Garner plays Elektra\n\nWho is Elektra? Elektra is a highly trained assassin.

Of course, Evans is also known for his career-defining role as Captain America, as well as starring in Knives Out, The Gray Man, and Scott Pilgrim vs the World.\n\nHenry Cavill plays a Wolverine variant\n\nWho are the Wolverine variants? The Wolverine variants are different versions of Wolverine that Deadpool comes into contact with across the multiverse.\n\nWhere have I seen Henry Cavill before? Cavill is best known for his role as Clark Kent/Superman from Man of Steel onwards. He's also known for his role as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher, and for films including Argylle and Enola Holmes.\n\nMatthew McConaughey plays Cowboy Deadpool\n\nWho is Cowboy Deadpool? Cowboy Deadpool is a variant of Deadpool. While we never see McConaughey properly, there's no mistaking that Southern drawl – and the credits confirm it's him, too.\n\nWhere have I seen Matthew McConaughey before? McConaughey is known for films including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Magic Mike, Dallas Buyers Club, The Wolf of Wall Street and The Gentlemen.\n\nWunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15/Verity Willis\n\nWho is Hunter B-15/Verity Willis?
