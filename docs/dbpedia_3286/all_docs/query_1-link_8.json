        "text": "Our season opens with The Wedding, which seemed awfully quick for me, being that they only got engaged a few episodes ago. I'm sure the male audience who have had to suffer through their own brideszilla stories are thankful we were spared conversations about the upcoming day. It's a shame we never got a bachelor party episode, but its not surprising given the audience. I bet Jonah could have had some priceless lines in that one. Robbie was Parker's best man, and he remarks that's he always thought Harry would do that. It's also telling that Parker has no other male friends, beyond Robbie, Dr Conners and Jameson. Flash was in attendance, even though they'd never got passed the bully stage of their friendship yet.\n\nBetween the inclusion of Kingpin, The Scorpion, The Black Cat, The Green Goblin and yet another needless appearance from Alistair Smythe, (I assume those Smythe toys were just not selling!) the episode was just too crowded. But, they were married in the end, just as they were in the comics.\n\nOur next storyline is enjoyable, but I admit it felt out of place in a Spider-Man show. When Parker discovers his parents passports in his Aunt's attic he learns that they travelled all over the world before he was born. May was selling her house and an old friend of Bens shows up requesting something of his that Ben held. Further investigation reveals that Parker's parents that his parents were accused traitors during World War II and their allegiance was sworn to the Soviets and they perished in a plane crash before either claim could be proven. Demanding the truth, Parker sought to fly to Russia to investigate. Duping Jameson into thinking Spider-Man was traveling to Moscow in a bid for world domination, Jameson agreed to fly Parker to the Red Square and oddly, Robbie believes Parker's BS story and insisted he accompany Parker, to Parker's puzzlement. Alongside this, the world at large learned that a Nazi scientist was in fact still alive which triggered The Kingpin's intrigue as said scientist actually developed a 'Doomsday' weapon which he believed would win the Nazi's World War II. Demanding the weapon be in his possession, Fisk reassembled The Insidious Six, with The Vulture replacing the dead Mysterio and they travelled to Russia to strong arm the scientist to reveal the location of the weapon.\n\nWhile a lot of this storyline would have made sense if the show had been set in 1962, the idea that Parker's parents were young in WWII would suggest that Mary gave birth to Peter in her 60s. Trying to factor Mr and Mrs Parker's age into the equation will only leave one with answers that make little sense. The episode also sees the introduction of Silver Sable and her Wild Pack, who involve themselves in the skirmish between Spidey and The Insidious Six. The story later takes us back to the States and we learn the reason Keane Marlow was visiting May was because she had his Destroyer costume and power ring. We eventually learn that following the successful experiment with the Super Soldier Formula in WWII, the Government commissioned 5 more experiments. The exact formula could not be replicated because of the death of Dr Erkstein and due to wartime chemical shortages, only 5 subjects were given the treatment. Upon utilising their powers, each learned that the formula effected them differently, but their powers were not permanent, and each was commissioned with a ring to preserve their power. Alongside Captain America, The Thunderer, The Destroyer, The Black Marvel, Miss America and The Whizzer, they became The Six American Warriors. I actually thought the group was a homage to the Justice League of America originally, but I later learned that they were Timely/Atlas characters, the superheroes Marvel featured long before Stan The Man and King Kirby thought up a Fantastic Foursome. Semper later told me he greatly enjoyed looking up these heroes from before his time.\n\nThere's a lot to enjoy in the story, but it does feel out of place in a Spider-Man show. There is a lot of good in here, especially with the late Paul Wildred portraying The Black Marvel/Omar Mosely as he explains to Spidey/Peter/Robbie the origins of the 6. Wildred is one of the best storytellers I've ever heard, he is greatly missed. I also enjoyed the subtle moments between Spider-Man and The Destroyer Keane Marlow and Spidey asks if he missed being a superhero when he hung up his suit and he receives this response;\n\n'I miss it more than I miss the very air I breath'\n\n'I had a feeling you'd say that... The worst thing is, I agree with you.'\n\nThis goes alongside Stan Lee's explanation in the early days of The Amazing Spider-Man in which Parker admits that one of the main reasons he continues to be Spider-Man is that he's hooked on the thrilled of it all.\n\nThe story is all over the place after that as we learn that The Doomsday weapon actually turns one into living power, the Russian chief of Police we met in the first episode is actually the son of The Red Skull (who again must have been in his 50s by the time the story took place in the 1900s), Captain America and The Red Skull return from the vortex from which they have been trapped since 1945 (no frozen in ice for Cap here... Or whatever they did to Skull to preserve him until he returned in the modern day). I have to admit it was cool seeing Captain America at the time, but I remember the cameo of his origin in season four being much cooler. We now live in a world where Captain America is much cooler then he was when this show aired but it seemed that Cap returned and was sent back into the vortex a little too quickly for my liking. Reinhold (Skulls son) was eventfully the subject for the Doomsday and became Electro. I can't imagine anyone predicting he doomsday weapon to be Electro, or as Fisk summed up\n\n'You mean to tell me the this Doomsday weapon is another Neanderthal in a costume?'\n\nReinhold then turns against his Dad far too quickly and demand the world surrender itself to him. There's a massive error in these episodes, which is simply unforgivable from a production standpoint. Two entire scenes are played in the wrong order, as we see Spider-Man and Captain America are fighting The Red Skull and The Chameleon, we cut away and then see are captured by the dreadful duo... To set up the fight we've just seen. How this magnificent screw up managed to make it past as many people as it did before it made it to air still baffles me. Semper even admitted that he watched the episode on TV having long turned in the last script and cried out at the idiocy of it all.\n\nThe story ends with Cap sacrificing himself to defeat Electro and The Red Skull and he winds up back in the vortex that he's been trapped in since the 40s. It was a fun arc, but it probably had far too much going on for its own good. The Insidious Six were especially wasted... In some of the episodes they didn't even bring their respective voice actors in as they had no lines of dialogue to record. At the time when there was an animation draught for Captain Rogers, it was especially cool to see Captain America get his due.\n\nThe show took a stupid turn for the worst following the Six Forgotten Warriors with the two part Return of Hydro Man. The story sees Peter and MJ on their honeymoon when she is kidnapped by Bench, and it is revealed that MJ is actually a clone, created by Dr Miles Warren who had been trying to clone humans unsuccessfully but later learned of Bench's ability to metamorphosis into liquid and he managed to successfully clone Bench who in turn demanded Warren clone MJ, which explained why MJ had no memories as to where she was during most of season four. The cloning procedure was never quite perfected and eventually both her and Hydro Man's cells break down entirely they both die. I thought this was an entirely stupid decision at the time and given MJs minimal impact from her return, one questions why they bothered to bring her back at all. The thought behind the idea was apparently to emphasis that being Spider-Man meant Peter could never get the girl... That idea was played out beautifully at the end of Turning Point, why undo it in order to do a much worse job of it again? It still baffles me. Things get worse from there as Madame Web returns, which at the time wasn't welcome.\n\nHowever, this time she served a purpose beyond belittling Spidey. We finally got to the point of all her training, as she teleported Spider-Man to a world Paradise world that had peace throughout the land. In all his travels, nothing intrigued The Beyonder more than Earth's concept of good and evil and he devised The Secret War to test which was greater. To do this, The Beyonder teleported some of Earth's various criminals, including Dr Doom, The Red Skull, Dr Octopus, The Lizard and Smythe (again!) to the planet and let them run riot for a year. Allowing Spider-Man to pick his own team to lead them into battle, Parker initially selected his allies based on his opponents, Captain America was the obvious choice to battle The Red Skull and having never fought Doom before, he theorised that The Fantastic Four would be the logical choice to oppose Doom. He rounded out his team with his friend Iron Man and realising he only has enough power for one more ally, he selected Storm, believing her power to be the greatest of The X-Men.\n\nA little behind the scenes tidbit here. Series writer Jim Krieg sent me the original outline of the episode via old school snail mail after I interviewed him many moons ago, which had various notes of interest attached. Originally, all of The X-Men and The Incredible Hulk were supposed to appear. The X-Men were cut due to the cost of flying the Canadian cast to LA and the Mr Sinister/Magneto subplot went along with it and Hulk was cut as he was soon to appear in his own show on UPN and Fox had no interest in promoting a character who was going to air on a rival station (the same thing happened with a Ghost Rider episode that was supposed to take place in season four... Although having read that outline, it's not a bad thing. The inclusion of a mindless Venom and Carnage following their demise in season three was interesting, but that was where my interest ended. One can only imagine how much hesitation Fox would have putting Ghost Rider on the air.)\n\nHulk’s role in the story was taken by The Lizard, who like Hulk in the original Secret Wars comic, had his human mind in the creators body. The X-Men subplot was simply cut in its entirety. The whole point of the episode was that Spider-Man was the leader of his team, which was criticised at the time. I would argue it was a Spider-Man show… no one else should’ve been leading the team. Obviously Captain America lead the Six Forgotten Warriors, Iron Man lead Forceworks and Reed leads the FF… Spidey was probably the least qualified to lead the time, but this was the dilemma of which our hero was tasked. He constantly questioned his every move and had Iron Man and Dr Conners teleport The Black Cat to their planet as moral support…\n\nThe storyline seemed a little short in retrospect, but given how much of it was cut, but it has a strong opening with Spidey selecting his team and a great ending in which Dr Doom steals The Beyonder’s power and banishes the villains and Parker convinces Doom that he cannot control the Godlike abilities he has acquired, and Doom scoffs at his advice, advising that none of them would give up their powers if given the opportunity. This version of Doom was far better than anything that had come before it… I remember thinking it was a lot better than the Doom who appears in the Fantastic Four cartoon which aired at the same time.\n\nIt was cool seeing all of the heroes teaming up, it must be said. As odd as it reads now, this was the first time Captain America and Iron Man had teamed up together on TV. The ending had a brilliant cliffhanger which set up the finale in which we learn that the Secret Wars were a test that several Spider-Man from different dimensions and our Spidey was chosen to lead them. We were shown a dimension that we learned that Spider-Man had been cloned and had it rough… following the death of this dimension’s Aunt May and the realisation that he was actually a clone of Peter Parker and not the real one, he snapped and went after the Scarlet Spider, who was the real Spider-Man. When attempting to stop The Kingpin using Dr Ohn’s interdimensional teleportation technology, a carnage symbiote and he became Spider-Carnage with intention of creating a massive bomb which would destroy every dimension… Kingpin remarks that Spider-Carnage is the most evil person he has ever seen.\n\nMadame Web then brings various Spider-Men from other dimension to stop Spider-Carnage, who has also recruited The Green Goblin and The Hobgoblin. There’s an argument that they were fitting as many different Spider-Man toys in the show before it concluded, but it was cool seeing them all together. The episode also has a decent cliffhanger when Spider-Man and The Scarlet Spider are at the mercy of the six armed Spider-Man when he is transformed into Man-Spider, in a nice throwback to season two. The final episode give us a great story in which our Peter is transported to the armoured billionaire Spider-Man’s dimension and he has no secret identity and is a celebrated superhero and engaged to Gwen Stacey. Spider-Carnage ends up kidnapping her. The rest of the episode is essentially a battle of Spider-Man’s own conflict with himself, and he soon realises.\n\nSpider-Man: “I’ve got to stop him! No… that’s what I’m doing wrong. I have to remember that my enemy here... isme. Maybe I shouldn’t be trying to defeat him, maybe what I need to is understand him. I’m forgetting everything Madame Web has taught me over all these months!”\n\nHe then brings Uncle Ben to inspire Spider-Carnage and to learn again that Peter needs to use his power responsibly. Taking it to heart, he tries to expel the symbiote, but finds it too difficult and instead destroys the interdimensional transporter and commits suicide. Having saved all reality, we are then taken to the actor Spider-Man’s dimension in which Spider-Man is a character in fiction where he meets co-creator Stan Lee and confesses to Stan that for the first time since he became Spider-Man, he is happy with who he is. He overcame what he felt were his own shortcomings and lead his team to victory in the Secret War and then saved everyone in an untold number of realities…even his Uncle from another dimension told him how proud he was of who he’d become. Madame Web then tells him that they are going to find the real Mary-Jane, as he is finally entitled to some happiness.\n\nThen it ended. It wasn’t the perfect ending, as it left a rather large cliffhanger as to where the real Mary Jane actually ended up… one wonders again what the point of making a clone of her truly served, as if they didn’t, the ending would’ve worked beautifully. As a young viewer in Yorkshire, I had no idea the show had concluded… when it came to the following September, I was expecting more new Spider-Man episodes and to find out what happened to the real Mary Jane. Instead, to my young horror, I learned Spider-Man had been cancelled and its place was The Silver Surfer… I cannot begin to explain how horrible the realisation was when I sat down and watched the Surfer drain the life out of me with its boring nonsense when I still had so much love for this Spidey show.\n\nThrough my own investigations, I learned that more episodes were not ordered as Margaret Loesch, the woman who spent the better part of a decade trying to get Marvel cartoons on the air, had a massive falling out with Avi Arad, and cancelled the show, which was Fox’s number one hit in every market it aired, in order to spite Arad. Semper had left the office when he turned the last script in and realised they weren’t going past episode 65. He later stated that he planned to take Spider-Man to Victoria era England where Mary Jane was to stop Jack The Ripper, who was actually Carnage, but of course, nothing ever materialised.\n\nThe show’s legacy is mixed. Many consider it a success as a Spider-Man show, while others argue that it has aged too horribly and doesn’t compare to other great superhero shows. I have a love for the show that is half nostalgia, half appreciative of good storytelling, but agree that certain aspects of the show are now difficult to watch. I think it was mostly a wonderfully written show but rarely put together well. Its opening season is very strong, but it faltered the longer it went on… it’s repeated shortcuts with animation and simply sloppy errors are too difficult for many to get passed, which I understand. How the show is not available on region 1 DVD to this day I will never understand… to my knowledge, it never made it to Netflix and was butchered in Disney XD airings. It maintained strong numbers through it’s reruns, strong enough that Warner Bros. had to rethink their plans for their Superman animated show to become The New Batman/Superman Adventures as Spidey reruns were dominating Superman in the ratings.\n\nThe show had a massive influence of the later live action trilogy and no doubt helped boost Spider-Man’s popularity in the 1990s which no doubt in turn caused Sony to consider the options for the live action movies at the early part of the turn of the decade. As for Spidey fans? Again, opinions are mixed on the show. I think the vast majority of them would argue The Spectacular Spider-Man has it beat on every level, and I couldn’t disagree.\n\nI will close this post with this point… the current Spider-Man show on air at time of writing couldn’t match Spider-Man: The Animated Series on it’s best day. Semper fought for a show that was like the Spider-Man of his use youth, unpredictable, heat felt and thrilling… not just a 22 minute licencing advertisement that pollutes the airwaves these days.\n\nIf you’re a Spidey fan and you’ve never seen the show, it’s available on Region 2 DVD and available to view on Marvel.com (I believe). Seek it out, I am sure you’ll find something you like in there.\n\nNext: Pure crap.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series and the strength of the reruns and the fact that the show's merchandise was still shifting incredible numbers, it was quite quickly realised that cancelling Spider-Man was in fact a foolish idea and Fox and Marvel agreed to produce a new Spider-Man show. Whether or not Loesch agreed to put her differences aside with Arad or if she left the company I do not know, but given the massive dive in quality, I assume it was the latter.\n\nArad had no wish to continuously butt heads with Semper over the direction of the show again, so he was not invited to return.\n\nAnother turn of events saw the long litigation surrounding the rights to the live action Spider-Man movies resolved, with Columbia Pictures (Sony) finally signing the dotted line. As a result of this, for reasons unknown, Marvel/Fox were forbidden from producing a 'classic' Spider-Man cartoon, which meant the high school/Year One show was removed from the table. Spider-Man 2099 was discussed, but given the backlash Marvel had received from removing Peter Parker from the comics and making someone else Spider-Man, they decided against doing it on the small screen.\n\nInstead of finding a truly creative way around it with the deadline looming, Arad deemed that the show would essentially become a toy advert. History has proven that animal/man hybrid's and battle armour were proven toy sellers, which were then mandated into the show as central characters.\n\nWill Meugnoit, one of the producers of the successful X-Men series on Fox was hired to produce the show, alongside Larry Brody. Longtime animation veteran Michael Reeves, responsible for many fine episodes of Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends, the 1980s The Incredible Hulk and Warner Bros' Batman: The Animated Series was hired as the story editor, and he has personally admitted the show is terrible, which should give you a good idea of where the rest of this post is headed.\n\nBrody served as the show runner on the aforementioned Silver Surfer show, which should've come as a forewarning as to how dull the show would be. How one could be considered for a place on a Spider-Man show after the dismal showing Silver Surfer I do not know.\n\nThe show is similar to the original X-Men visuals, with the thick black outlining to each character and complex designs that are were too too difficult to animate on a show which looked to have a weak budget. The show is not remembered fondly for its murky visuals. The animation isn't especially strong and the colouring does not flatter the already tame designs. As Spider-Man's classic costume was apparently off limits, a new tech based suit was utilised... I personally don't care for it. I miss the webbing on the mask, the yellow eyes do nothing for me and the suit looks clunky... It's not Spider-Man. It also inexplicably has a cape, which serves no purpose. The suit is nano-tech, developed (stolen?) from Reed Richards, in a nod to the comics which I try not to think about too much. If he's pal with Reed Richards, why wouldn't the Fantastic Four travel to counter Earth with him? That's right up Reed's street, building a rocket to travel to other side of the universe would be a fun afternoon for Mr Fantastic.\n\nThe premises of the show was an odd one, and the writing was never strong enough to overcome such poor creativity. John Jameson discovers Counter Earth, and attempts to fly a space shuttle to the other planet which is interrupted by Venom and Carnage, who yearn to travel to Counter Earth because of something called the Syonobtic, which was never truly explained in any of the shows 13 episodes. Neither was why Venom and Carnage were suddenly teaming up, after every previous version of them had them as bitter enemies. They were the most popular Spider-Man villains of the 90s, so including them made sense. I imagine the fact the two were proven toy/merchandise sellers had more of a say. The Venom design isn't actually too bad, weird bones and jaw aside. The Carnage model is utterly horrible and sadly looks like a child's drawing of Cletus Cassidy's alter ego. It literally looks like a symbiote covered skeleton with a stupid jaw. Just terrible. These versions of Venom and Carnage are instantly forgettable throughout the show. They're can also now liquid morph, like the T1000 from Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I didn't care for this silly gimmick either.\n\nThe flight is ruined by Venom and Carnage and Spider-Man is blamed. Realising he has essentially doomed Jameson, he lets the world believe Spider-Man when he collapses under a pile of rubble and 6 months later, he hijacks the shuttle which was commissioned to rescue Jameson from the now hostile counter Earth. In a move so stupid for even this show, Spidey covers for Parker's absence by announcing over the radio that Parker is joining Spider-Man on his trip to counter Earth... Only he does it using the same Spider-Man/Parker voice. Only a fool wouldn't realise that Parker isn't Spider-Man at that point.\n\nMight as well add it in now too... Chris Barnes was not invited to reprise his roles from the previous Spider-Man show and Rino Ramano was cast. Ramano is an utterly awful Spider-Man. Completely overdoing both the comedy and dramatic side to his performances, he is God awful. He was the voice of Spider-Man for many years after this show concluded on various Spider-Man video games including an awesome PlayStation game and its lacklustre sequel, an X-Men fighting game and a surprise cameo in a PS2 Wolverine game. He's not the worst voice ever for Spidey, but he is up there. The rest of the casting sadly isn't up to much either... There's not a memorable voice to be found.\n\nThe highlight of the opening story is the red and black classic Spider-Man suit. It would appear that try traditional red and blue suit was off limits, and hence it became red and black with yellow eyes. It was a very cool model admittedly, but I prefer red and black to red and blue, personally. There's a nice nod to the older Spidey show when Parker changes to Spidey and the old TAS theme blares out in the background. When these are considered among the true highlights of the show, you know to expect very little else good from it.\n\nThe show turned to crap as soon as Spidey reached counter Earth, as Spidey teamed with rebels to stop Te High Evolutionary and his beastials, Arad's genius idea for toys. Realising he has a mess to fix before returning home, Spidey stays on counter Earth for the rest of the show's run. The premises is too far away from Spider-Man and he appeared to lost his good sense of humour, of Ramano best it out of him... Each episode is simply a chore to sit through. The 'reimagines' of the various Spider-Man villains fail to offer anything of interest and the supporting cast do nothing worth writing home about.\n\nThe best episode is One Is The Loneliest Number in which Venom appears to add something useful to the show and Spider-Man is left with the moral choice to let his enemy die, or save him. He ends up actually rebounding with the symbiote to keep it alive long enough so it can bond back to Brock and keep him alive. It is telling that the highlights of the series are the throwbacks to the older Spider-Man show.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, including Amazing Spider-Man writer Dan Slott, the the two shows are not in the same continuity. The Venom flashbacks prove this, as does the fact that Spidey is still with MJ before the show moves worlds, when of course, MJ was still in limbo. They just don't fit.\n\nThere are some potentially interesting ideas to be found in the show, such as Peter boards with Naoko and her young son. Said lady also happens to be the ex girlfriend of this worlds Green Goblin, who is an unlikely hero in this show. It is something of an original concept, but sadly no true great stories come from it.\n\nThe rest of the villains are merely pale imitations Spidey's classic rouges, including Counter Earth versions of Kraven The Hunter, The Vulture and Electro, who is an electric eel dubbed Eelectro... If you were tempted to hunt down the show, that's probably put you off it.\n\nFox realised they had a clunker on their hands almost as soon as it was released. Over in the States, only 3 episodes aired in its original run as it was easily trumped in the ratings by Pokemon, then the new craze. The remaining 9 episodes did eventually make air, but the show had long finished production by the time it did. A second season was commissioned and many scripts were written, but Marvel's bankruptcy put an end to that, along with the second seasons of The Silver Surfer, The Avengers: United They Stand. It as safe to say that the quality of Marvel animation had long since been flushed down the toilet with this trio of terrible television shows.\n\nI have little in the way of childhood memories of the show. I could not get Sky at my house in my youth due to cumbersome trees opposite on my neighbours land, and the show never aired on terrestrial British television. The show had long since been cancelled by the time I ever laid eyes on it, although I did read the companion comic, which looking back, was of far superior quality to the writing of the television show. My brother eventually managed to tape the show in its entirety when my cousin got Sky at his house, but this again was many years after the show concluded. I was aware from online reports of the shows quality and the fact it ended on a cliffhanger. I eventually saw it and thought it sucked, to be blunt. I had no desire to watch any of the episodes more than once. I can honestly say without hesitation that I would sooner watch Spider-Man: The Animated Series' The Spot or The Rocket Racer than even the best episode of this crap.\n\nIt is simply a soulless toy advert, void of any creativity. I eventually created a website for the show in the days when I was a completist webmaster for Marvel Animation Age... A young Stu decided to stay sober for the weekend and reviewed and captured every episode of the show. Reading the reviews back is a cringeworthy experience now, and makes me realise why Arsenal volunteered to take over as reviewer for Marvel Animation Age from there on (except in rare occasions when your writer felt you lucky enough to chime in with his thoughts if Arsenal was away or if we had two shows to review, in those cases I usually took Spidey and Arsenal took Wolverine. I miss Arsenal. I would be interested I hearing his take on the current era (error?) of Marvel animation.\n\nThe shows legacy is one of shame. It never made a toyline, so it was essentially a pointless exercise. It has few fans and has more or less been completely forgotten about. This suit made it into 2 Spider-Man games for the original PlayStation, and the character was one of the many killed in the recent Spider-Verse crossover in the comic books, which is now probably written out of continuity, so he could return... But would anyone really care if he did?\n\nNext: Spidey Goes Hollywood"
