As the epigraph implies, most of us (unless we’re diehard grinches or scrooges) become children again at Christmastime, in one way or another, because so much childlike fantasy surrounds the holiday. What began centuries ago as a humble holiday for the devout to observe the birth of Jesus Christ has evolved into, and largely been replaced by, a secular season exploding with the fantasy/mythos of jolly ole fat, red-suited santa Claus and his all-too-familiar trappings: north pole workshop, elves, sleigh and reindeer with rudolph, billions of toys and presents delivered worldwide on Christmas eve, and so forth. in short, santa has become the center of Christmas fantasy, the king of Christmas festivities. since the early 20th century, the ﬁlm industry has been quite inﬂuential in perpetuating and promoting Christmas fantasy and the santa mythos, from live-action classics such as Miracle on 34th Street to animated classics such as Rudolph, the RedNosed Reindeer. perhaps more so than live-action ﬁlms, animated cartoons have skyrocketed the Christmas/santa fantasy into the realms of wacky comedy, often with bizarre and outrageously hilarious story lines. in a large percentage of these cartoons, various villains, monsters, and legions of other bogies either kidnap santa, impede his deliveries, or shut down the north pole, such that without santa there are no presents, and no presents mean no Christmas; hence, Christmas must be “saved” lest it be cancelled. though such cartoons are often peppered sporadically with the generic, pC mantra of “Christmas is all about being with friends and family” (conspicuously omitting any religious implications), the overwhelming, materialistic emphasis is on receiving presents. it is therefore not surprising that cartoons devoted exclusively to the nativity and the birth of Christ are in the minority. this encyclopedia presents more than 1,800 international, Christmas- related cartoon titles, both religious and secular (including Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and new year’s themes), selected from databanks totaling nearly 170,000 cartoons of all genres from print and internet sources (see references). Herein will be found silent cartoons, theatrical shorts, feature ﬁlms, television specials, direct-to-video movies, and episodes from animated television series, the latter of which constitute the majority of the cartoons here. there are cartoons from all continents, except Antarctica. the cartoons are listed alphabetically by individual titles; however, for television series with two or\n\nmore holiday episodes, those episodes appear as subentries under the titles of the series with matching “see” cross-references. unless otherwise speciﬁed, it is understood that the cartoons are produced in the united states in color, with sound, and in english. each entry provides brief background material about the cartoon or television series including year of release/years on the air; plot synopsis; songs and awards as applicable; voice cast (with live-action actors as applicable); and production credits (writers, producers, directors, production companies, video companies, ratings, and running times). most, but not all, of the cartoons are available in some video format or online media, such as DvD, vHs, youtube, Hoopla, Hulu, netﬂix, vimeo, Dailymotion, Amazon video, and others as indicated. titles may appear on video labels other than those cited herein, and studios may withdraw previously released titles from the video market at any time. if readers are interested in an exhaustive history of animation, the subject has been detailed in, for example, works by erickson, lenburg, and maltin in the references and will not be repeated here. instead, the following summarizes noteworthy “ﬁrsts” pertaining to Christmas cartoons: Animated Christmas cartoons were ﬁrst produced in russia, before the soviet era banned Christmas and replaced it with celebrations of the new year as the chief winter holiday; a host of cartoons subsequently reﬂected that latter theme. the earliest Christmas-related cartoons were Christmas of the Forest Inhabitants (1911), Christmas at the Fox’s Boarding House (1912), and The Insects’ Christmas (1913), all of which were silent, black-and-white, stop-motion shorts made by Wladyslaw starewicz in moscow. though the ﬁrst two have been lost, The Insects’ Christmas, produced by the Khanzhonkov Company, remains as the oldest Christmas cartoon extant. the ﬁrst known Christmas cartoon in the united states: Old Doc Yak’s Christmas (1913, see Old Doc Yak); ﬁrst color Christmas cartoon: Disney’s Santa’s Workshop (1932) from the Silly Symphony series of shorts; ﬁrst feature-length cartoon with a Christmas segment: Disney’s The Three Caballeros (1944) sporting a latin American “las posadas” segment; ﬁrst feature-length Christmas cartoon: The Night before Christmas (russia, 1951); ﬁrst animated Christmas special and the ﬁrst television special: Mister Magoo’s Christmas Carol (1962). Despite the many hundreds of cartoons here, this work is still not an exhaustive compilation of every Christmas-related cartoon known to man. i avoided those cartoons wherein the set1\n\n2\n\nPreface\n\nting was Christmastime or related holidays, yet the story line otherwise had nothing to do with those holidays. likewise, i shunned cartoons with generic, wintertime settings with snow frolics but lacked a deﬁnitive holiday story line. nevertheless, a few classic cartoons of the latter type managed to sneak past this encyclopedia’s “santa-Censor.” to lend some dignity to these holiday subjects, and since most of the cartoons are aimed at young viewers, i also omitted “adult” cartoons with blasphe-\n\nmous, sacrilegious, or pornographic themes and those riddled with abominably obscene language. yet, it is possible that a few “controversial” cartoons skirted past the santa-Censor to raise a few readers’ eyebrows and induce a few gasps. All photographs were selected from the ﬁles of photofest Digital library, based in new york City, for purposes of illustrating certain principal characters, should readers not be familiar with them.\n\nThe Encyclopedia A\n\nfor research.

Episode from the CGI American/Canadian television series The Backyardigans. Featuring animated bipedal, anthropomorphic animals, The Backyardigans was a musical adventure series of 80 half-hour episodes that ran on Treehouse TV in Canada from 2004 to 2010. The ﬁve preschool protagonists were Uniqua, a pink, high-spirited, unique creature; Pablo, a blue penguin with a yellow beak; Tyrone, a red-headed, orange moose; Tasha, a yellow hippopotamus; and Austin, a purple kangaroo. Possessing tiny hammers, they could build anything necessary at a moment’s notice. The Backyardigans lived in houses of corresponding colors, and their back yards served as the settings for their adventures. The characters brought on their adventures via their vivid imaginations, whereupon their back yards were transformed into the appropriate settings, complete with musical numbers spanning a variety of genres and with 3-D dance choreography. The series utilized live-action dancers, the movements of whom were initially ﬁlmed and then transported to animation. In “Action Elves,” Uniqua, Pablo, and Tasha assume the secret elf code names of, respectively, Snappy, Mr. Jingles, and Flappy, as they pursue the Abominable Brothers (portrayed by Austin and Tyrone), who have stolen Santa’s magic bag. The Brothers entertain themselves by wishing for items of comfort and pleasure that the bag provides. Confronting the Brothers at their igloo-home, the Action Elves do not retrieve the magic bag until a phone call from Santa convinces the Brothers that the bag is his and that Christmas depends on his dispensing presents from it. Until that time, the Brothers had not realized to whom the bag belonged.

Direct-to-video movie in the Adventures in Odyssey video series, based on the Evangelical Christian radio drama/ comedy series of the same title, begun in 1987. The video series revolves around the ﬁctional town of Odyssey and the wisdom of elderly John Avery Whittaker, owner of the ice-cream emporium Whitt’s End. Though he initially denounces Christmas commercialism, young Dylan dives head-ﬁrst into a neighborhood “Spirit of Christmas” yarddecorating contest to win a speed bike that his parents otherwise cannot afford. He begins by building a simple Nativity scene outdoors, but when the bully Doug, his chief competitor, erects giant snow dinosaurs, snow sculptures of Elvis, revolving snowmen, and miles of lights, the contest turns into a war of one-upmanship and sabotage. On the night of judging, a major mishap destroys Dylan’s and Doug’s work, leaving only the simple Nativity scene untouched, with Dylan’s little angel-clad sister Jesse singing “Silent Night.” Though Jesse wins the prized bike, she gives it to Dylan. But Dylan, now remembering his Angel Tree obligation, delivers the bike to the little boy whose name he had drawn. The lesson: Just as Jesse gave her gift to an undeserving Dylan, so God gave the gift of Jesus to an undeserving world.

But the mischievous wind Oh-No steals the boy doll from the sleigh for himself and names it Hey You, while back at Santa Town, Santa’s love for the girl doll brings her to life as his daughter Candy Claus.

The trio of protagonists consisted of Hoppity Hooper, a naïve frog; Professor Waldo P. Wigglesworth, a con-artist fox; and Fillmore, a dimwitted bear clad in Civil War attire, all of whom traveled together across the country seeking get-rich-quick schemes. Interspersed between the four-part story lines were components from other series such as “Fractured Fairy Tales,” “Peabody’s Improbable History,” “Mr. Know-It-All,” and “Commander McBragg.” The syndicated runs assembled each four-part story into a single half-hour episode. Posing as an elf, the gangster Little Poison commandeers Santa’s sleigh and reindeer from the North Pole with plans for his gang to pose as phony Santas on Christmas Eve and steal presents from homes, using the sleigh as a get-away vehicle. As Santa (sans beard and fat belly) searches for the reindeer, he encounters Hoppity, Waldo, and Fillmore in Foggy Bog, Wisconsin. Though the trio help Santa search for alternate transportation in vain, the crooks hidden with the reindeer in a barn betray themselves with sneezing ﬁts, whereupon the trio and Santa chase them via a rented bicycle built for two and skis, temporarily delayed by falling through a hole in the ice.

Direct-to-video movie, based on the titular collectible plush toy that ﬁrst appeared in Target stores in 1997. The subject is not Christmas as such but is usually included in holiday fare because of the winter theme. With the arrival of snowy winter, Cha Cha the squirrel, Flops the rabbit, Simon the mouse, and La Rue the bird joyfully greet the arrival of their special friend, Snowden the Snowman, then prepare for a round of sledding. But because Cha Cha is too scared to plunge down the steep hill, she leads the others on a wild-goose chase under the false premise of ﬁnding her lucky nut. They search in a hibernating bear’s cave, at the home of inventor Sly Fox, and bring in ﬂying reindeer Einstein for an aerial search. When Sly’s smelling invention traces the nut back to Cha Cha’s house, she admits the truth about her fear of sledding downhill, and Snowden provides the necessary encouragement for her to overcome that fear.

To satisfy the boy’s curiosity about that experience, Alabaster takes him back to Bethlehem in a dream, where he joins the shepherds and Wise Men at the manger. Years later the boy, now a man, forgets about Alabaster’s song and thus fails to hear it each Christmas, until his own little boy hears it and reminds his father to listen for it.

Based on the creator himself and his exgirlfriend, the series revolved around the adventures of the titular couple who lived in a forest home, whose episodes often parodied popular ﬁlms and TV series with nonsense humor and running gags.

Yet the Zolonian Zox family attempts to assist the Peoples, even if they misinterpret the traditions. For example, the Christmas greeting is “Hairy Christmas”; the fat gift-bringer is “Santa Clocks,” who leaves gifts in stockings set on ﬁre because the latter hang over the ﬁreplace, and because of his “Ho Ho Ho,” he apparently works in a garden with a hoe; and the Christmas symbol is a decorated “spine tree.” Ultimately, it’s the kind thought that counts.

A spinoff of the Madagascar series of ﬁlms and running for 149 episodes on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons from 2008 to 2015, The Penguins of Madagascar was set in the Central Park Zoo in New York City and followed the adventures of four penguin protagonists who were trained as spies: Skipper, the ringleader who was afraid of needles and viewed activities as military operations; Kowalski, an illiterate inventor; Rico, a psychopathic weapons and explosives specialist who swallowed tools and regurgitated them when needed; and Private, the rookie who spoke with a British accent. Other supporting characters included King Julien XIII, the ring-tailed, narcissistic monarch of the lemurs; Maurice, an aye-aye who disdained Julien; Mort, a dimwitted mouse lemur who was devoted to Julien; and Marlene, a female otter who served as a buffer between the penguins and the lemurs. In “All Nighter,” it’s Christmas Eve at the zoo, and the animals prepare to celebrate “Kidsmas,” the penguins’ term that describes Christmas for the animal children. Some of the animals vote for a contemporary party, whereas others desire a more traditional, 19thcentury theme based on the Christmases of Charles Dickens, and an argument erupts. Although Marlene attempts to arbitrate, the scene degenerates into a snowball battle that ruins many of the decorations. Meanwhile, Skipper and Private stalk bell-ringing street Santas in search of Santa’s magic, and Julien wreaks havoc in search of the perfect Kidsmas tree when he, Maurice, and Mort steal the city’s gigantic Christmas tree and attempt to haul it back to the zoo atop a stolen news van, which prompts a high-speed chase by the police. Just as Skipper and the animal children are sure that Kidsmas is ruined, the real Santa arrives and advises Skipper that he had Santa’s magic all along, which is simply to make people happy. With that, Skipper conjures up colorful decorations and the Kidsmas party begins. Lemurs are prominent in the series, because they are endemic to the island of Madagascar, whereas penguins live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially Antarctica. Therefore, the irony of four penguins living up North in New York City contributes all the more to the comedy of the series. The animals’ slapstick antics parallel those of the Warner Bros. cartoons of yesteryear.\n\n8\n\nAll’s Squared\n\nSeries Awards: Twenty wins and 33 nominations.

Jones for Cartoon Network and ITV. Running for 52 episodes from 2011 to 2013, the series was set in the Banana Cabana, a popular resort managed by Howie, a hospitality-challenged dog.

To celebrate the “Howiedays,” the Cabana staff form their own traditions: for example, Piggy creates a giant jelly mold, Narwhal communicates by singing, and Bunny tells the story of Howiedays through puppetry. Poodle “celebrates” by sabotaging everyone’s traditions and arranging for everyone to blame each other, but Howie’s tradition of a jet-powered parade ﬂoat that crashes and sinks carries Poodle back to her childhood. Repenting for having turned Howie into a “stunting maroon,” Poodle “tries” to be nice for everyone’s sake for a few hours. 11 min. The Perfect Gift (October 27, 2011). Narwhal isn’t known for giving great Howieday gifts; they usually involve some kind of incendiary device that would immolate the receiver. So when Narwhal gives himself as a present to Bunny and hides in a box, she’s reluctant to open it and tosses it into Duck’s incinerator. Believing that Narwhal is the “perfect gift,” the gang realize that he’s in the box and rescue him from a ﬁery end. Seeing Octo running around in ﬂames after accidentally falling into the furnace, Narwhal believes that Octo had received his gift. 11 min.

In the town of Ironville, the mean-spirited miser and town despot D.D. Kovet has cancelled Christmas for the past 25 years for the sake of maintaining proﬁts at his mill and keeps a Christmas Patrol to ensure that no one celebrates. All that changes when the little peasant girl Angela, accompanied by her talking pet wolf Wilfred, arrives to bring the spirit of Christmas back into the town. When she is betrayed for selling holly, the Christmas Patrol banishes her from town into the snowy weather.

Determined to bring a Christmas tree into town, she receives aid from young friends and eventually from the Christmas Patrol itself, deeply moved when Angela’s bravery saves a young friend from drowning. As the spirit of Christmas circulates among the town, its citizens congregate to decorate the tree in the town square, but an irate Kovet threatens to close the mill.

The protagonist, Ami Matsuzaki, was a preschooler whose room led via a door in the ﬂoor to AniYoko, a world populated entirely by stuffed animals. Though Ami had never personally visited AniYoko, she had regular visits from three of its inhabitants, known as the Happy Trio: Iyo the rabbit, Kenta the teddy bear, and Issa the panda. Mr. Yamanami the horse, leader, and Santa of AniYoko appeared periodically. After Ami and the Trio play a rather disappointing game of “musical Christmas presents” (a blend of secret Santa and musical chairs), Mr. Yamanami pops up with a gift for Ami. But since she has prepared a present for the human Santa and expects one from him, she bids Yamanami to give his present to her parents. Yamanami/Santa works by bringing only one present, then takes another possession from the recipient and delivers that to someone else while taking another object from that recipient and delivering it to yet another person, and the cycle continues. This may work well in AniYoko, but it’s maddening in Ami’s world.\n\n13\n\nVoices: Erika as Ami; Rumi Shishido as Iyo; Naomi Nagasawa as Kenta; Yuko Sato as Issa; Kenyu Horiuchi as Mr. Yamanami.

Though Timothy was heard, he was never seen, only his shadow. The Christmas episodes in chronological order: Waiting for Santa Claus (1998). On Christmas Eve while Timothy is out wrapping presents, the animals query each other about Christmas. Those in the “know” explain about decorations and presents, and that’s the extent of their knowledge, so they decide to decorate Timothy’s room with visiting friend Kinker the mouse and ﬁnd secret presents. Later, Timothy informs them about Santa and, of course, more presents, whereupon the gang advises the live animals outside, such as Squirrel and Mrs. Mole with her babies, to hang up their stockings for Santa. That night, the animals sneak a peek for Santa (unseen), who urges them back to sleep, lest there be no presents. 10 min. A Very Special Day (1998).
