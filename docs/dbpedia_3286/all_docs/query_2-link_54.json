        "meta_description": "The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy may have defeated the mighty Thanos, but if there’s one thing we’ve learned in Phase 4, it’s that the MCU still has plenty of bad guys to go around. We’re about to meet another major villain in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, a sequel that introduces Chukwudi Iwuji’s character The High Evolutionary.\n\nNow that the first Guardians 3 trailer has arrived, let’s take a closer look at this long-standing Marvel villain as well as the strange planet known as Counter-Earth, and learn why he could play a key role in the MCU’s Multiverse Saga. This is our Guardians of the Galaxy 3 trailer breakdown!\n\nPretty much everything you need to know about The High Evolutionary is right there in the name. Basically the Dr. Moreau of the Marvel Universe, The High Evolutionary is a brilliant geneticist who’s obsessed with advancing the human race at all costs. His unholy super-science has given rise to a new breed of human/animal hybrids known as New Men, along with all sorts of other twisted science experiments.\n\nAdditionally, the first Guardians Vol. 3 trailer opens with the team making another trip to Earth, following up on Drax and Mantis’ last field trip in the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. However, something is clearly wrong with this world, and it quickly becomes clear the Guardians aren’t on Earth at all, but Counter-Earth.\n\nCounter-Earth is the High Evolutionary’s other signature creation. This artificial replica of Earth is meant to be a paradise where Wyndham can pursue his unholy experiments, free from the prying eyes and pesky morals of humanity. Counter-Earth is an almost exact mirror of the regular Earth. It even orbits on the exact opposite side of the Sun. The twist is that time moves very differently on Counter-Earth, allowing Wyndham to speed up his evolutionary experiments.\n\nSo watch our Guardians 3 trailer breakdown for the details on this and much more!",
