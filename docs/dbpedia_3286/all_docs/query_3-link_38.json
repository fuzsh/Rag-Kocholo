Many researchers on the keystroke dynamics have treated the verification of a fixed short password which is used for the user login. In this research, we pay attention to the identification and investigate several characteristics of the keystroke dynamics in Japanese free text typing. We developed Web-based typing software in order to collect the keystroke data on the Local Area Network and performed experiments on a total of 112 subjects, from which three groups of typing level, the beginner's level and above, the normal level and above and the middle level and above were constructed. Based on the identification methods by the weighted Euclid distance and the neural network for the extracted feature indexes in Japanese texts, we evaluated identification performances for the three groups. As a result, high accuracy of personal identification was confirmed in both methods, in proportion to the typing level of the group.\n\nA Cultural Comparison of Conflict-Solution Styles Displayed in the Japanese, French, and German School Texts\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTomo, Rieko\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the ways how to solve the conflicts between parents and children by statistical analyses displayed in Japanese, French, and German school texts published in 2000.

However, information about human polyphenol intake is scarce, especially in the elderly. This study aimed to estimate the dietary intake and major sources of polyphenols and to determine whether there is any relationship between polyphenol intake and micronutrient intake in healthy elderly Japanese. First, 610 subjects (569 men, 41 women; aged 67.3 Â± 6.1 years completed food frequency questionnaires. We then calculated their total polyphenol intake using our polyphenol content database. Their average total polyphenol intake was 1492 Â± 665 mg/day, the greatest part of which was provided by beverages (79.1%. The daily polyphenol intake differed largely among individuals (183â4854 mg/day, also attributable mostly to beverage consumption. Coffee (43.2% and green tea (26.6% were the major sources of total polyphenol; the top 20 food items accounted for >90%. The polyphenol intake did not strongly correlate with the intake of any micronutrient, suggesting that polyphenols may exert health benefits independently of nutritional intake. The polyphenol intake in this elderly population was slightly higher than previous data in Japanese adults, and beverages such as coffee and green tea contributed highly to the intake.\n\nTeaching Japanese Popular Culture\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDeborah Shamoon\n\n2010-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Japanese popular culture has arrived on American college campuses as never before. Student interest in Japanese manga (comic books, anime (animated films and television shows, and video games drives much of the enrollment in Japanese courses and Japanese majors and minors. In response to student interest, as well as the establishment of popular culture as a topic of serious academic scholarship, the demand for courses on Japanese popular culture has never been higher. Yet the number of scholars specializing in the study of popular culture is still relatively small. This can potentially create problems, as faculty teach outside their expertise, and perhaps face an uncomfortable situation in which the students know more about the topic than the professor. In this article, I will offer some suggestions and advice for faculty creating a popular culture course for the first time, based on my experiences teaching undergraduates at the University of Notre Dame. The course I developed reflects my background in Japanese literature and film, and is but one example of many possible approaches to the topic. The sample syllabus and list of resources at the end of this article provide citations for all text and media sources mentioned.\n\nOpen source, collectivism, and Japanese society\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nIitaka, Toshikazu\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper is about collectivism in the Network Society. Many researches about the Network Society evaluate collectivism, citing Japanese culture and Hacker culture as good models of such collectivism. However, some researchers, such as K. Abe in his analysis of âSeken,â criticize Japanese collectivism. Abeâs study pointed out the negative effect of Japanese collectivism on scientific progress. This paper will criticize Abeâs study and offer a new model for evaluating collec...\n\nDevelopment of Text Reading in Japanese: An Eye Movement Study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJincho, Nobuyuki; Feng, Gary; Mazuka, Reiko\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study examined age-group differences in eye movements among third-grade, fifth-grade, and adult Japanese readers. In Experiment 1, Japanese children, but not adults, showed a longer fixation time on logographic kanji words than on phonologically transparent hiragana words. Further, an age-group difference was found in the first fixationâ¦\n\nCitation Behaviors Observed in Japanese EFL Students' Argumentative Writing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKamimura, Taeko\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEffective use of outside source texts is one of the key components of successful academic writing. This study aims at clarifying Japanese university EFL students' citation behaviors in producing argumentative writing. Twenty-six Japanese university EFL students wrote an argumentative essay.

To understand its effect on forest ecosystem, Pb isotope ratios were determined in precipitation, various components of vegetation, the forest floor, soil and parent material in a Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) forest stand. The average 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratio in bulk precipitation was 1.14 Â± 0.01 (mean Â± SD), whereas that in the subsoil (20-130 cm) was 1.18 Â± 0.01. Intermediate ratios ranging from 1.15 to 1.16 were observed in the vegetation, the forest floor, and the surface soil (0-10 cm). Using the 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios, the contribution of anthropogenic sources to Pb accumulated in the forest were estimated by the simple binary mixing model. Sixty-two percent of the Pb in the forest floor, 71% in the vegetation, and 55% in the surface soil (0-10 cm) originated from anthropogenic sources, but only 16% in the sub-surface soil (10-20 cm) was anthropogenic. These results suggest that internal Pb cycling occurs mainly between surface soil and vegetation in a Japanese cedar ecosystem, and that anthropogenic Pb strongly influences Pb cycling. Although the Japanese cedar ecosystem has a shallow forest floor, very little atmospherically derived Pb migrated downward over 10 cm in depth\n\nJapanese dreams\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nSejrup, Jens\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper traces the history of a Japanese-funded annex to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam over the past twenty-five years.

The analysis focuses on three key years in the buildingâs history: 1991, 1999, and 2015. Critically examining public debate and media coverage of the building...... in contemporary Dutch- and Japanese-language sources, I argue that changing claims and public perceptions of Japan reflected the countryâs shifting economic fortunes and international position during the period. The sources consistently framed the Japanese-designed building within a language of dreams. However...\n\nThe Use of Sweet Almond Meal as a Protein Source in Japanese Quails Diets\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArjomandi MA\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In the first experiment, the chemical composition, apparent metabolizable energy (AME, AME corrected for nitrogen (AMEn, true metabolizable energy (TME, TME corrected for nitrogen (TMEn values of the sweet almond meal were determined in adult Leghorn cockerels. The second experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of different levels of sweet almond meal at 0, 100, 200 and 300 g/kg on Japanese quail's growth performance, some blood metabolites, relative weight of different organs, meat quality and egg yolk cholesterol in a completely randomized design with 288 Japanese quails including 4 treatments, 4 replicates and 18 birds per replicate. The metabolizable energy values of sweet almond meal were following: AME = 3734, AMEn = 3648, TME = 3908, TMEn = 3746 kcal/kg as fed basis. Feed intake, feed conversion ratio and live weight gain and relative weight of different organs in the birds fed diets with different levels of the sweet almond meal were not statistically different from control. A sweet almond meal at 300 g/kg level showed the lower serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (P < 0.05 compared to control and 100 g/kg sweet almond meal. Dietary treatments had no significant effect on the total cholesterol content of quail's eggs. Malondialdehyde concentration in breast meat samples after 40 days freezing decreased, whereas the level of sweet almond meal increased (P < 0.01. In general, a sweet almond meal without any adverse effect on growth performance is a good source of energy and protein and can be used up to 300 g/kg of the Japanese quail diets.\n\nML-Ask: Open Source Affect Analysis Software for Textual Input in Japanese\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichal Ptaszynski\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available We present ML-Ask â the first Open Source Affect Analysis system for textual input in Japanese. ML-Ask analyses the contents of an input (e.g., a sentence and annotates it with information regarding the contained general emotive expressions, specific emotional words, valence-activation dimensions of overall expressed affect, and particular emotion types expressed with their respective expressions. ML-Ask also incorporates the Contextual Valence Shifters model for handling negation in sentences to deal with grammatically expressible shifts in the conveyed valence. The system, designed to work mainly under Linux and MacOS, can be used for research on, or applying the techniques of Affect Analysis within the framework Japanese language. It can also be used as an experimental baseline for specific research in Affect Analysis, and as a practical tool for written contents annotation.

This article is based on a study, conducted for an honours thesis, which invited four Japanese wives living in South East Queensland to describe, together with their Australian husbands, their familyâs interactions with Japan, its language and culture, and the local Japanese community. It was recognised that the extensive social networks these wives had established and maintained with local Japanese women from other Japanese-Australian intermarriage families were an important part of their migrant experience. This article will firstly review the literature on contemporary Japanese- Australian intermarriage in Australia and Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. It will then describe and examine the involvement and motivations of the four wives in their social networks. Entry into motherhood was found to be the impetus for developing and participating in informal, autonomous networks. Additionally, regular visits to Japan were focused on engagement with existing family and friendship networks. The contemporary experience of intermarriage for these women is decidedly transnational and fundamentally different from that of the war brides, or sensÅ hanayome.\n\nEye movement control in reading unspaced text: the case of the Japanese script.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKajii, N; Nazir, T A; Osaka, N\n\n2001-09-01\n\nThe present study examines the landing-site distributions of the eyes during natural reading of Japanese script: a script that mixes three different writing systems (Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana) and that misses regular spacing between words. The results show a clear preference of the eyes to land at the beginning rather than the center of the word. In addition, it was found that the eyes land on Kanji characters more frequently than on Hiragana or Katakana characters. Further analysis for two- and three-character words indicated that the eye's landing-site distribution differs depending on type of the characters in the word: the eyes prefer to land at the word beginning only when the initial character of the word is a Kanji character. For pure Hiragana words, the proportion of initial fixations did not differ between character positions. Thus, as already indicated by Kambe (National Institute of Japanese Language Report 85 (1986) 29), the visual distinctiveness of the three Japanese scripts plays a role in guiding eye movements in reading Japanese.\n\nThe Cultural Semantics of the Japanese Emotion Terms 'Haji' and 'Hazukashii'\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGian Marco Farese\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a cultural semantic analysis of the Japanese emotion terms âhajiâ and âhazukashiiâ, made using the methodology of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM. The paper has three aims: (i to pinpoint the conceptions of âhajiâ and âhazukashiiâ as emotion terms in Japanese language and culture; (ii to highlight the differences in meaning with their typical English translations âshameâ and âembarrassingâ, and show that âhajiâ and âhazukashiiâ reflect two different, culture-specific emotion conceptions; (iii to emphasise the suitability of NSM for cross-cultural comparisons of emotion terms in different languages and, in turn, for cross-cultural training. The examples adduced are taken from various sources, including a Japanese dictionary, the Kotonoha corpus of Japanese language and Japanese novels.\n\nComparison of postmenopausal endogenous sex hormones among Japanese, Japanese Brazilians, and non-Japanese Brazilians\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaciel Maria\n\n2011-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Differences in sex hormone levels among populations might contribute to the variation in breast cancer incidence across countries. Previous studies have shown higher breast cancer incidence and mortality among Japanese Brazilians than among Japanese. To clarify the difference in hormone levels among populations, we compared postmenopausal endogenous sex hormone levels among Japanese living in Japan, Japanese Brazilians living in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, and non-Japanese Brazilians living in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a control group of case-control studies in Nagano, Japan, and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Participants were postmenopausal women older than 55 years of age who provided blood samples. We measured estradiol, estrone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS, testosterone and free testosterone by radioimmunoassay; bioavailable estradiol by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method; and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG by immunoradiometric assay. A total of 363 women were included for the present analyses, comprising 185 Japanese, 44 Japanese Brazilians and 134 non-Japanese Brazilians. Results Japanese Brazilians had significantly higher levels of estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, estrone, testosterone and free testosterone levels, and lower SHBG levels, than Japanese. Japanese Brazilians also had significantly higher levels of bioavailable estradiol, estrone and DHEAS and lower levels of SHBG and androstenedione than non-Japanese Brazilians. Levels of estradiol, testosterone and free testosterone, however, did not differ between Japanese Brazilians and non-Japanese Brazilians. These differences were observed even after adjustment for known breast cancer risk factors. We also found an increase in estrogen and androgen levels with increasing body mass index, but no association for most of the other known risk factors. Conclusions We found higher levels of\n\nUSABILITY TESTING OF JAPANESE CAPTIONS SEGMENTATION SYSTEM TO SCAFFOLD BEGINNERS TO COMPREHEND JAPANESE VIDEOS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYa-Fei Yang\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available A major learning difficulty of Japanese foreign language (JFL learners is the complex composition of two syllabaries, hiragana and katakana, and kanji characters adopted from logographic Chinese ones. As the number of Japanese language learners increases, computer-assisted Japanese language education gradually gains more attention. This study aimed to adopt a Japanese word segmentation system to help JFL learners overcome literacy problems. This study adopted MeCab, a Japanese morphological analyzer and part-of-speech (POS tagger, to segment Japanese texts into separate morphemes by adding spaces and to attach POS tags to each morpheme for beginners. The participants were asked to participate in three experimental activities involvingwatching two Japanese videos with general or segmented Japanese captions and complete the Nielsenâs Attributes of Usability (NAU survey and the After Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ to evaluate the usability of the learning activities. The results of the system evaluation showed that the videos with the segmented captions could increase the participantsâ learning motivation and willingness to adopt the word segmentation system to learn Japanese.\n\nOne Film, or Many?: The Multiple Texts of the Colonial Korean Film \"Volunteer\"\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJaekil Seo\n\n2012-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Until recently, studies on films from colonial Korea in the Japanese empire had to rely primarily on secondary texts, such as memoirs, journal and newspaper articles, and film reviews. The recent discovery of original film texts from archives in Japan, China, Russia, and elsewhere and their availability on DVD format, prompted an important turning point in the scholarship. However, juxtaposing these newly released DVD versions with other archival sources exposes significant differences among the existing versions of texts. For instance, a newly discovered script reveals that important segments are missing in the recently released DVD version of the propaganda film \"Volunteer.\" There also exist important discrepancies in the dialogue among the original film script, the actual film version, the synopsis, and the Japanese subtitles. Some of the Korean-language dialogue, which might be interpreted as exhibiting some ambivalence toward Japanese imperial policies, was completely silenced through strategic omissions in the Japanese-language subtitles targeting Japanese audiences. Some Japanese-language translations of the script also exhibit drastic changes from the original Korean-language dialogue. Piecing together such fragmented and fraught linguistic dissonance found in the colonial archives, we can conjecture that viewers from the colony and the metropole of \"Volunteer\" may have consumed very different versions of the film. This article aims to examine the significance of such dissonance, which has only recently become audible in so-called films of transcolonial coproduction.\n\nThe role of readability in effective health communication: an experiment using a Japanese health information text on chronic suppurative otitis media.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSakai, Yukiko\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThis study identifies the most significant readability factors and examines ways of improving and evaluating Japanese health information text in terms of ease of reading and understanding. Six different Japanese texts were prepared based on an original short text written by a medical doctor for a hospital web site intended for laypersons regarding chronic suppurative otitis media. Four were revised for single readability factor (syntax, vocabulary, or text structure) and two were modified in all three factors. Using a web-based survey, 270 high school students read one of the seven texts, including the original, completed two kinds of comprehension tests, and answered questions on their impressions of the text's readability. Significantly higher comprehension test scores were shown in the true or false test for a mixed text that presented important information first for better text structure. They were also found in the cloze test for a text using common vocabulary and a cohesive mixed text. Vocabulary could be a critical single readability factor when presumably combined with better text structure. Using multiple evaluation methods can help assess comprehensive readability. The findings on improvement and evaluation methods of readability can be applied to support effective health communication. Â© 2013 The authors.

This uncomfortable situation has continued for nearly one hundred years and has had serious effects on Japanese science. In this short report, the author discusses and analyses these effects. In order to put Japanese science on a sound basis, the author proposes to increase the number of articles, reviews and textbooks in Japanese, first by translation and second by the voluntary efforts of scientists themselves. As centers devoted to this activity, the author proposes to construct \"Airborne Libraries\" which are maintained and accumulate in an electronic form the scientific documents written in Japanese.\n\nJapanese women in the contemporary society\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDinca Violeta Mihaela\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this paper is to examine Japanese society and present contemporary issues with emphasis on the changes in the role, status and preferences of Japanese women within the Japanese society, through the years. The first part of the paper makes an overview on the evolution of the role of women in Japanese society during Shogunate until now, focusing mainly on increasing Japanese women's status within the enterprise. In the second part of the paper, the author exposes the results of several studies on the effects on the marketing of luxury for Japanese women, highlighting the correlation between increased interest to be as competitive in the workplace and enhancing concern for luxury brands.\n\nLead and other elements in house dust of Japanese residences â Source of lead and health risks due to metal exposure\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYoshinaga, Jun; Yamasaki, Kumiko; Yonemura, Ayumi; Ishibashi, Yuri; Kaido, Takaya; Mizuno, Kodai; Takagi, Mai; Tanaka, Atsushi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe levels of 25 elements in house dust collected from 100 general Japanese residences were measured. Factor analysis was applied on the multi-element data to explore source of Pb (median concentration 49.1Â mg/kg) in house dust. Six factors were extracted and Pb was found to have great loading on the fifth factor with Sb and Sn, suggesting solder (Sn), and plastic and metals (Sb) may be the sources of Pb in the house dust of Japanese residences. No significant loading was found on soil-related factors indicating non-significant contribution of Pb in track-in soil. Seven heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn) were found in house dust at >10 times more condensed than crustal abundance. Health risk of these elements to children via the ingestion of house dust was estimated based on the comparison with tolerable daily intake and found to be non-significant for most of the elements. - Highlights: â¢ Multi-element analysis was carried out for house dust from households in Japan. â¢ Factor analysis was applied on the multivariate data set. â¢ The abundance of lead had a close relationship with antimony and tin in house dust. â¢ Health risk of heavy metals in house dust for children was not serious. - Major source of Pb in house dust of Japanese residences was not track-in soil but unknown materials that contain Pb and Sb and/or Sn\n\nA Comparison of English and Japanese Proverbs Using Natural Semantic Metalanguage\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMiles Neale\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This investigation examines the meaning of semantically similar English and Japanese proverbs. It uses textual data sourced from online corpora to highlight and compare the different cultural and conceptual elements embedded within these proverbs. The findings of this investigation demonstrate that matching proverbs from different languages is a potentially problematic exercise, both in dictionaries and in the second-language classroom.\n\nHamlet and Japanese Men of Letters\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKawachi Yoshiko\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Shakespeare has exerted a powerful influence on Japanese literature since he was accepted in the second half of the nineteenth century. Particularly Hamlet has had a strong impact on Japanese men of letters and provided them with the impetus to revive the play in contemporary literature. In this paper I discuss how they have utilized Hamlet for their creative activity and enriched Japanese literature.\n\nRobust Estimation of Productivity Changes in Japanese Shinkin Banks\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJianzhong DAI\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper estimates productivity changes in Japanese shinkin banks during the fiscal years 2001 to 2008 using the Malmquist index as the measure of productivity change. Data envelopment analysis (DEA is used to estimate the index. We also apply a smoothed bootstrapping approach to set up confidence intervals for estimates and study their statistical characteristics. By analyzing estimated scores, we identify trends in productivity changes in Japanese shinkin banks during the study period and investigate the sources of these trends. We find that in the latter half of the study period, productivity has significantly declined, primarily because of deterioration in technical efficiency, but scale efficiency has been significantly improved. Grouping the total sample according to the levels of competition reveals more details of productivity changes in shinkin banks.\n\nAcquisition of Japanese science and technology information in the United States\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKinzey, B.\n\n1991-04-01\n\nCritical needs exist in the U.S. for access to and productive use of Japanese scientific and technological (S T) information. Japan has become a major competitor to the U.S. in numerous areas and the acquisition of intelligence on Japanese S T activities is becoming a necessary endeavor to maintain the health of much of U.S. industry. Unfortunately, most American organizations are still relatively inexperienced in the acquisition and use of different foreign information sources compared to their Japanese counterparts. As in any new endeavor, would-be or should-be users may be unaware of the range of different information sources available and potential benefits or pitfalls that accompany their use. This paper describes some common sources of information on Japanese S T activities and notes their associated strengths and weaknesses. General cautions and recommendations regarding the use of different sources compiled from personal and related staff experiences are also provided. 3 refs., 1 tab.\n\nEating habits and internal radiation exposures in Japanese\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShiraishi, Kunio\n\n1995-01-01\n\nRecently, annual dose equivalent for Japanese was estimated to be 3.75 mSv. Medical radiation exposures (2.25 mSv/y) and exposures from natural sources of radiation (1.48 mSv/y) were the major contributors to this dose. Dietary intakes of both natural and man-made radionuclides directly related to internal exposures. In this paper, internal doses received only through ingestion of radionuclides in food are described; internal doses through inhalation have been excluded. First, the representative intakes of radionuclides for Japanese were estimated from the literature. Second, the annual dose equivalents were calculated according to intakes of individual radionuclides and weighted committed dose equivalents (Sv/Bq) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection Pub. 30. Total annual doses through radiation of natural sources and man-made sources, were estimated as 0.35 mSv and 0.001 mSv, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of imported foods on internal dose in Japanese were calculated preliminarily, because the contribution of imported foods to Japanese eating habits is increasing annually and will not be negligible when assessing internal dose in the near future.

Besides it studies the knowledge of Russian learners of Japanese and carefully examines their knowledge of four typical kinds of \"role language\" in Japanese anime and manga by using a questionnaire and follow-up interviews. From the results of the textbook research, the following two things are revealed; (a first person pronouns except for watashi are rarely used, (b there is not enough explanations about different \"speaker's characters\" in detail. Furthermore, findings of the questionnaire show that some of the learners who have the same impression of the characters as Japanese native speakers, wrongly connect a certain \"role language\" to illustrations of a character, and results of as much as three kinds of \"role language\" have a low positive correlation with the learners' results of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. Results also reveal that all four kinds of \"role language\" have no correlation with other factors, such as student's duration of learning Japanese, or frequency of the use of Japanese outside the classroom.\n\nJaSlo: Integration of a Japanese-Slovene Bilingual Dictionary with a Corpus Search System\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKristina HMELJAK SANGAWA\n\n2012-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents a set of integrated on-line language resources targeted at Japanese language learners, primarily those whose mother tongue is Slovene. The resources consist of the on-line Japanese-Slovene learnersâ dictionary jaSlo and two corpora, a 1 million word Japanese-Slovene parallel corpus and a 300 million word corpus of web pages, where each word and sentence is marked by its difficulty level; this corpus is furthermore available as a set of five distinct corpora, each one containing sentences of the particular level. The corpora are available for exploration through NoSketch Engine, the open source version of the commercial state-of-the-art corpus analysis software Sketch Engine. The dictionary is available for Web searching, and dictionary entries have direct links to examples from the corpora, thus offering a wider picture of a possible translations in concrete contextualised examples, and b monolingual Japanese usage examples of different difficulty levels to support language learning.\n\nAssertions of Japanese Websites for and Against Cancer Screening: a Text Mining Analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOkuhara, Tsuyoshi; Ishikawa, Hirono; Okada, Masahumi; Kato, Mio; Kiuchi, Takahiro\n\n2017-04-01\n\nBackground: Cancer screening rates are lower in Japan than in Western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. While health professionals publish pro-cancer-screening messages online to encourage proactive seeking for screening, anti-screening activists use the same medium to warn readers against following guidelines. Contents of pro- and anti-cancer-screening sites may contribute to readersâ acceptance of one or the other position. We aimed to use a text-mining method to examine frequently appearing contents on sites for and against cancer screening. Methods: We conducted online searches in December 2016 using two major search engines in Japan (Google Japan and Yahoo! Japan). Targeted websites were classified as âproâ, âantiâ, or âneutralâ depending on their claims, with the author(s) classified as âhealth professionalâ, âmass mediaâ, or âlaypersonâ. Text-mining analyses were conducted, and statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. Results: Of the 169 websites analyzed, the top-three most frequently appearing content topics in pro sites were reducing mortality via cancer screening, benefits of early detection, and recommendations for obtaining detailed examination. The top three most frequent in anti-sites were harm from radiation exposure, non-efficacy of cancer screening, and lack of necessity of early detection. Anti-sites also frequently referred to a well-known Japanese radiologist, Makoto Kondo, who rejects the standard forms of cancer care. Conclusion: Our findings should enable authors of pro-cancer-screening sites to write to counter misleading anti-cancer-screening messages and facilitate dissemination of accurate information.

Space in Japanese architecture (kukan, as a empty place. This word originally stood for a \"hole in the ground\", and in on present meaning of a \"hole in the universe\", or \"sky\". The ancient Japanese divided space vertically into two parts, sora (sky and ame or ama (heaven. In the concept of emptiness both of this above it can be said is a part of space. This paper will tries to explain and discusses about the meaning of space in Japanese Zen Buddhist architecture.\n\nBusiness Communication Needs of Japanese Companies in Malaysia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYeoh Lee Su\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Business relationship between Japan and Malaysia has developed very quickly in recent years. This has caused a dramatic increase in the need for individuals who possess language skills to function in Japanese businesses. In order to investigate the needs of our Malaysian graduates, a survey was conducted involving graduates of Japanese language minor program from a public university in Malaysia. The aims of the survey were to get an overall understanding of (1 the use of Japanese language at workplace where the Japanese language minor programâs graduates are employed; (2 identify problems faced in language use and in terms of Japanese business practices in workplace. The results indicated that the graduates use Japanese language to communicate with the employees of their workplace compared to outsiders. Â The findings also highlight that Japanese language listening and speaking skills are the most important skills needed by the graduates for their workplace success compared to reading and writing.

This associationism has resulted in attempts to create a social network and space for intercultural communication at a national level between Hispanic-Japanese families and Japanese residents in Spain. The research is based on numerical data and narrative data, however Japanese narratives from the quarterly association bulletins provide the main source of information. By using the narrative analysis method in the form of questions we have been able to study the writings in order to explore issues such as: their transcultural experiences, their processes of adapting to life in Spain, the evolution of their identity, their interpretation of the social reality around them and the passing on of their social and cultural heritage to their children, among others. The study of the Tanpopo association has demonstrated a close-knit and relaxed transcultural and female space for intraethnic communication. It reveals a joint strategy of emotional and instrumental support to overcome the isolation, the loss of social networks and the geographical separation from their own cultural region, resulting from the immigration through marriage of Japanese women living in Spain.\n\nJapanese Mapping of Asia-Pacific Areas, 1873-1945: An Overview\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nShigeru Kobayashi\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Japanese mapping in the Asia-Pacific region up to 1945 calls for scrutiny, because its development was a multifaceted process with military, administrative, political, and cultural dimensions. This article traces the changes in Japanese mapping of overseas areas to the end of World War II and assesses the significance of the resulting maps, called gaihÅzu, as sources for East Asian history. As implements of military operation and colonial administration, the gaihÅzu were produced during a protracted period by various means under changing circumstances. Expanding military activity also promoted differentiation among the gaihÅzu by increasing the use of maps originally produced in foreign countries. In conclusion, the need for detailed cataloging, in combination with chronologically arranged index mapping, is emphasized for the systematic use of the gaihÅzu.\n\nReading in Asian Languages: Making Sense of Written Texts in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGoodman, Kenneth S., Ed.; Wang, Shaomei, Ed.; Iventosch, Mieko, Ed.; Goodman, Yetta M., Ed.\n\n2011-01-01\n\n\"Reading in Asian Languages\" is rich with information about how literacy works in the non-alphabetic writing systems (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) used by hundreds of millions of people and refutes the common Western belief that such systems are hard to learn or to use.

Tarot decks reflect a deliberate adaptation process across both cultural and temporal borders, with visual components created and customized for a Japanese viewer. My aim is to consider the nature of these changes in imagery and to focus attention on an under-analyzed and mostly female-gendered domain. In particular, I look at the way the medieval European people and elements originally found on the cards are replaced with images from the world of Japanese art, history, and popular culture. These substitutions either gloss over the gaps between Western and Japanese world views or meld them into a new form, allowing the tarot entry into a different or hybrid metaphysical culture. Attention to tarot cards is important because of their great economic and cultural impact in contemporary Japan. A widespread love of tarot in Japan provides insight into domains of pleasure, spiritual exploration, and fandom.\n\nImperial Japanese Army Intelligence in North and Central China During the Second Sino-Japanese War\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSimon Hall\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The Japanese today seek to improve their national intelligence apparatus, particularly in relation to human intelligence assets and higher echelon coordination. To be successful, Japan must examine its wartime past in the intelligence field. The Imperial Japanese Army maintained a prolific intelligence presence in North and Central China during the Second World War. Its intelligence apparatus encompassed all aspects of information collection, with considerable overlap between intelligence organisations in an effort to avoid gaps in intelligence coverage. Japanâs intelligence system in North and Central China was nevertheless inefficient, exacerbated by inherent weaknesses and reactive rather than proactive alterations throughout the course of the conflict. This paper examines this lack of efficacy within Japanâs intelligence system during the Second Sino-Japanese conflict, and the efforts made to overcome difficulties faced by Japanese intelligence in North and Central China throughout this period.\n\nMeasurement of acoustic characteristics of Japanese Buddhist temples in relation to sound source location and direction.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSoeta, Yoshiharu; Shimokura, Ryota; Kim, Yong Hee; Ohsawa, Tomohiro; Ito, Ken\n\n2013-05-01\n\nAlthough temples are important buildings in the Buddhist community, the acoustic quality has not been examined in detail. Buddhist monks change the location and direction according to the ceremony, and associated acoustical changes have not yet been examined scientifically. To discuss the desired acoustics of temples, it is necessary to know the acoustic characteristics appropriate for each phase of a ceremony. In this study, acoustic measurements were taken at various source locations and directions in Japanese temples. A directional loudspeaker was used as the source to provide vocal acoustic fields, and impulse responses were measured and analyzed. The speech transmission index was higher and the interaural cross-correlation coefficient was lower for the sound source directed toward the side wall than that directed toward the altar. This suggests that the change in direction improves speech intelligibility, and the asymmetric property of direct sound and complex reflections from the altar and side wall increases the apparent source width. The large and coupled-like structure of the altar of a Buddhist temple may have reinforced the reverberation components and the table in the altar, which is called the \"syumidan,\" may have decreased binaural coherence.\n\nTemporal Architecture: Poetic Dwelling in Japanese buildings\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichael Lazarin\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Heideggerâs thinking about poetic dwelling and Derridaâs impressions of Freudian estrangement are employed to provide a constitutional analysis of the experience of Japanese architecture, in particular, the Japanese vestibule (genkan. This analysis is supplemented by writings by Japanese architects and poets. The principal elements of Japanese architecture are: (1 ma, and (2 en. Ma is usually translated as âintervalâ because, like the English word, it applies to both space and time.Â However, in Japanese thinking, it is not so much an either/or, but rather a both/and. In other words, Japanese architecture emphasises the temporal aspect of dwelling in a way that Western architectural thinking usually does not. En means âjoint, edge, the in-betweenâ as an ambiguous, often asymmetrical spanning of interior and exterior, rather than a demarcation of these regions. Both elements are aimed at producing an experience of temporality and transiency.\n\nSherlock (Holmes in Japanese (fan works [symposium\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLori Morimoto\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available I explore the history of Japanese writing centered on Sherlock Holmes as a means of interrogating the 2014 BBC Sherlock pastiche John and Sherlock Casebook 1: Jon, zenchi renmei e iku (The stark naked league, written by Japanese Sherlockian Kitahara Naohiko for mainstream publication by the publishing house Hayakawa shobÅ.

From this point of view, the long-term strategy for uranium procurement followed by the Japanese Government and utilities can be summarized in four points; diversification of supply sources, long term contracts, holding of sufficient inventory and self-supply (ie. involvement in exploration activity and mine development). Under this basic strategy, Japanese utilities have made decisions on which suppliers they buy uranium from, and which purchasing method to adopt, based on the principles of securing stable sources of supply and stable prices. This position is reviewed and discussed.

However, race may have differential effect on GVHD dependent on the graft source. North American Caucasian and Japanese patients receiving their first allogeneic BM or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantations from an HLA-matched sibling for leukemia were eligible. BM was used in 13% and 53% of Caucasian and Japanese patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the interaction term between race and graft source was not significant in any of the models, indicating that graft source does not affect the impact of race on outcomes. The risk of grades IIIâIV acute GVHD was significantly lower in Japanese than in Caucasian patients (hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57â0.96), which resulted in lower risk of non-relapse mortality in Japanese patients (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54â0.89). The risk of relapse was also lower in this group. Lower risk of non-relapse mortality and relapse resulted in lower overall mortality rates among Japanese patients. In conclusion, irrespective of graft source, the risk of severe acute GVHD is lower in Japanese patients, which results in lower risk of non-relapse mortality.

Using the theory of semiotics, I will explicate the narrative signifiers of \"the Other\" represented in Japanese mythology; examine the binary perceptions of disability in ancient myths, medieval literature, and latter-day folklore in Japan; and demonstrate how perceptions have changed historically. I argue that some of these antique perceptions of the Other that have survived in contemporary Japanese consciousness may be hampering our effort to understand human variation.\n\nHandling Japanese without a Japanese Operating System.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHatasa, Kazumi; And Others\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe Macintosh HyperCard environment has become a popular platform for Japanese language courseware because of its flexibility and ease of programing.

While PubChem currently includes approximately 16 million document-extracted structures (15 million from patents) the extent of public inter-document and document-to-database links is still well below any estimated total, especially for journal articles. A major expansion in access to text-entombed chemistry is enabled by chemicalize.org. This on-line resource can process IUPAC names, SMILES, InChI strings, CAS numbers and drug names from pasted text, PDFs or URLs to generate structures, calculate properties and launch searches. Here, we explore its utility for answering questions related to chemical structures in documents and where these overlap with database records. These aspects are illustrated using a common theme of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPPIV) inhibitors. Full-text open URL sources facilitated the download of over 1400 structures from a DPPIV patent and the alignment of specific examples with IC50 data. Uploading the SMILES to PubChem revealed extensive linking to patents and papers, including prior submissions from chemicalize.org as submitting source. A DPPIV medicinal chemistry paper was completely extracted and structures were aligned to the activity results table, as well as linked to other documents via PubChem. In both cases, key structures with data were partitioned from common chemistry by dividing them into individual new PDFs for conversion. Over 500 structures were also extracted from a batch of PubMed abstracts related to DPPIV inhibition. The drug structures could be stepped through each text occurrence and included some converted MeSH-only IUPAC names not linked in PubChem. Performing set intersections proved effective for detecting compounds-in-common between documents and merged extractions. This work demonstrates the utility of chemicalize.org for the exploration of chemical structure connectivity between documents and\n\nTranslation and equivalence assessment for a Japanese version of the modified Parental Nurturance Scale: a comparative study\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGriffiths Peter\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background This paper reports on the modification of the Parental Nurturance Scale (PNS, translation of the modified version (PNSM from English to Japanese, and equivalence assessment between the PNSM and the translated version (PNSM-J. The PNS was modified so as to enable its use in nurturance studies where the prime source of nurturance might vary between respondents. Method It was translated into Japanese through the forward-backward translation procedure. With attempting to enhance representativeness of language in the target populations, translators used were married couples that consisted of a native English speaker and a native Japanese speaker. Multiple translations were produced and used to make a single Japanese version. A panel of reviewers identified problems in conceptual and semantic equivalence between the original and the translated versions. The Japanese version was altered accordingly with reference to alternate Japanese forms from the original English to Japanese translations. The altered translation was again re-translated into English and problematic differences were checked. This forward-backward process was repeated until satisfactory agreement was attained. The PNSM was administered to 222 native English speakers and the PNSM-J to 1320 native Japanese speakers. Results Factor analysis and target rotation revealed a nearly identical factor structure and factor loadings of the items of the PNSM and PNSM-J between the different cultural groups. High Cronbach's alpha coefficient supported the reliability of the test scores on both versions. Conclusion The equivalence between the two scales was supported. It is suggested that the PNSM and PNSM-J are suitable tools for comparative cross-cultural studies.\n\nGendered Characteristics of Female Learnersâ Conversational Japanese\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaki Yoshida\n\n2011-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This study examines gendered characteristics in four female Japanese language learnersâ discourse practices in a communicative setting, where they interact with native Japanese speaking friends in a JFL context. Focusing on the relationship between gender ideologies and discourse practices, I explore the extent to which learners are aware of gender ideologies in the Japanese community and how these ideologies are influential in their discourse practices in the particular setting. In addition, how native speakers of Japanese evaluate gender-differentiated features produced by the learners during the interaction is investigated. Qualitatively-approached, this study revealed that each learner possesses a unique character in their utterances and perceptions, reflecting their individual awareness of gender ideologies and their negotiation of language use against the backdrop of social expectations. At the same time, a lack of such awareness emerged as an issue which kept them from fully and actively engaging in exploring their subjectivities. In addition, this study pointed out that native Japanese speakers utilised gender ideologies as the basis for their judgements on learnersâ gendered features in their interaction.\n\nDeterminants of Corporate Social Responsibility in Japanese Companies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMagdalena Krukowska\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the factors that determine the Japanese approach to corporate social responsibility (CSR to facilitate future empirical research in the Polish conditions. Methodology: To conduct the research, the available literature concerning CSR, managerial behaviour and stakeholder relations in Japan was studied. The research was conducted onsite in Japan after consultation with local experts, both Japanese and foreigners, specialized in Japanese management and the economy. Findings: The Japanese approach to CSR is strongly determined by their religious, philosophical, cultural, historical, economic and legal factors. It is proof of the concept of CSR contextuality, which provokes questions about the nature of the business relations of Japanese companies with their foreign counterparts and their style of management while investing abroad. Research limitations: The methodology was only supposed to gain a general view of the factors infl uencing CSR in Japan. Studying more detailed issues with the use of empirical data was complicated because of the short time available for the research (6 weeks and the relatively low level of transparency of the Japanese companies. Value: The study helped in understanding managerial decisions and Japanese business behaviour in the context of corporate responsibility and the ethics of its everyday operations. It was the fi rst research thoroughly analyzing many of the determinants of CSR in Japan, which may be valuable for any counterparts cooperating with the Japanese companies and foreign researchers analyzing Japanese management systems.\n\n[German-Japanese scientific exchange in urology in the early 20th century].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHalling, T; Umehara, H; Moll, F\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper analyzes the importance of the German language and German culture and institutional development of urology in Japan in the early 20th century, starting from the development of the medical school for Japanese in Germany and their function in the process of modernization of the Meiji period (1868-1912). Examples of bi-directional German-Japanese relations in medicine, which also included an integrated knowledge transfer, are shown. The study is based mainly on Japanese and German sources about Japanese physicians in Germany as well as contemporary publications in German and international medical journals. Methodologically, the article combines quantitative analysis with individual biographical aspects.\n\nValidating the Japanese translation of the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation and comparing performance levels of American and Japanese students\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichi Ishimoto\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFull Text Available This study assesses the Japanese translation of the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE. Researchers are often interested in comparing the conceptual ideas of students with different cultural backgrounds. The FMCE has been useful in identifying the concepts of English-speaking students from different backgrounds. To identify effectively the conceptual ideas of Japanese students and to compare them to those of their English-speaking counterparts, more work is required. Because of differences between the Japanese and English languages, and between the Japanese and American educational systems, it is important to assess the Japanese translation of the FMCE, a conceptual evaluation originally developed in English for American students. To assess its appropriateness, we examined the performance of a large sample of students on the translated version of the FMCE and then compared the results to those of English-speaking students. The data comprise the pretest results of 1095 students, most of whom were first-year students at a midlevel engineering school between 2003 and 2012. Basic statistics and the classical test theory indices of the translated FMCE indicate that its reliability and discrimination are appropriate to assess Japanese studentsâ concepts about force and motion. In general, the preconcepts of Japanese students assessed with the Japanese translation of the FMCE are quite similar to those of American students assessed with the FMCE, thereby supporting the validity of the translated version. However, our findings do show (1Â that only a small percentage of Japanese students grasped Newtonian concepts and (2Â that the percentage of Japanese students who used two different concept models together to answer some questions seems to be higher than that of American students.\n\nDeriving and Interpreting Ka(karimusubi in Premodern Japanese\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMoreno MITROVIÄ\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper provides a new syntax and semantics for kakarimusubi (KM, a focus construction prominent in the grammar of Old Japanese (OJ and Early Middle (Classical Japanese (CJ, which diachronically developed into the interrogative construction in Modern Japanese (MdJ headed by the ka particle. Adopting Chierchia & Caponigroâs (2013 novel analysis of Free Relatives (FRs as embedded interrogatives, an FR-based analysis of KM is proposed so as to obtain a compositional semantic analysis of this focus construction as well as an account of the adnominal marking of the presuppositional musubi component of this grammatical construction.\n\nOn the Formation of Verb Compounds in Early Middle Japanese\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWenchao LI\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper is dedicated to the formation of verb compounds in Early Middle Japanese, a stage of the Japanese language used in the Heian Period (794â1185. The findings reveal that current verb compounds have come a long way from Old Japanese. Multiple verbs in Old Japanese are assigned to an associate type, rather than a compounding type of relation. Thus, the serial constituents receive equal syntactic weight, giving rise to the extensive use of the coordinate type and succession type of multi-verbs. In Early Middle Japanese, the combinations of the two constituents seem much tighter, giving rise the frequent use of the modifier-predicate V-V. The conclusion emerging from this study is that it was not until Early Middle Japanese that verb compounds in the strict sense appeared. Moreover, two types of verb weakening are observed in Early Middle Japanese: (a transformation of the first verb into a prefix, (b grammaticalization of the second verb into a directional/resultative complement.\n\nThe Use of Source-Related Strategies in Evaluating Multiple Psychology Texts: A Student-Scientist Comparison\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nvon der MÃ¼hlen, Sarah; Richter, Tobias; Schmid, Sebastian; Schmidt, Elisabeth Marie; Berthold, Kirsten\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMultiple text comprehension can greatly benefit from paying attention to sources and from using this information for evaluating text information.

The study investigates what it takes to get an accurate match when searching for a specific diagnostic code. For each code the evaluation starts by extracting the words that make up its text and continues with building full-text search queries from the combinations of these words. The queries are then run against all the ICD-10 codes until a match indicates the code in question as a match with the highest relative score. This method identifies the minimum number of words that must be provided in order for the search engines choose the desired entry. The engines analyzed include a popular Java-based full-text search engine, a lightweight engine written in JavaScript which can even execute on the user's browser, and two popular open-source relational database management systems.\n\nJapanese Hadron Project\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYamazaki, Toshimitsu\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe Japanese Hadron Project (JHP) is aimed at producing various kinds of unstable secondary beams based on high-intensity protons from a new accelerator complex. The 1 GeV protons, first produced from a 1 GeV linac, are transferred to a compressor/stretcher ring, where a sharply-pulsed beam or a stretched continuous beam will be produced. The pulsed beam will be used for a pulsed muon source (M arena) and a spallation neutron source (N arena). A part of the proton beam will be used to produce unstable nuclei, which will be accelerated to several MeV/nucleon (E arena). The purpose and impact of JHP will be described in view of future applications of hadronic beams to nuclear energy and material science.

The present paper reviews previous research on the readability and simplification of Japanese texts, and presents an analysis of a collection of simplified texts for learners of Japanese as a foreign language. The simplified texts are compared to their original versions to uncover different strategies used to make the texts more accessible to learners. The list of strategies thus obtained can serve as useful guidelines for assessing, selecting, and devising texts for learners of Japanese as a foreign language.\n\nThe Rise and Decline of Japanese Pacifism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYuan Cai\n\n2008-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The Japanese pacifist constitution has been a symbol of Japanâs commitment to peace and more importantly its renunciation of wartime militarism. There has been strong support for its continuing existence amongst the Japanese populace despite persistent attempts by the Japanese government to amend it. However, the prevalent pacifist sentiment is showing signs of fading vitality in recent times. This article purports to examine the underlying forces that contributed to the development and the decline of Japanese pacifism. A host of domestic and international factors were responsible for the growth of pacifism and its subsequent decline, but only three important domestic factors will be examined in detail: the concept of victimhood in the development of pacifism and its implication for its continuing strength, the importance of peace education and the role played by the influential Japanâs Teachersâ Union on the formation of pacifist conscience and finally, the influence of leftist organisations on the organised peace movement.\n\nSilent Bodies: Japanese taciturnity and image thinking\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAna DoÅ¡en\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available A nonverbal transmission and an implicit way of communication are highly encouraged in Japanese society. The reason for this âsilence prerogativeâ is often found in historical facts of lengthy feudal era or in ancient philosophies and religions such as Buddhism and Confucianism and their various concepts which privilege taciturn way of communication. Moreover, the unspoken comprehension is often complemented by the attitude which equates truthfulness with silence. This paper explores the silence as a communicative act in the domain of Japanese art, where the body takes over the place of the language. In traditional Japanese theatrical performance, such as noh, words are often inadequate to convey emotion and therefore the aesthetics of emptiness, understatement and abstraction is transcended by the masks with \"nonmoving lips\". Drawing on theoretical perspectives from both East and West, I argue that the silent bodies operate as deliberate and integral determinants of Japanese non-silent art forms â especially in cinema and theatre. In the Eastern thought, visual perception is fundamental in cognition of the world, whereas auditory discernment is secondary to \"image-thinking\" (Yuasa. Accustomed to taciturnity, Japanese audience effectively corresponds to the performance and \"completes\" it in silence.\n\nThe Japanese Amateur Textual Production Scene: Activities and Participation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlvaro David HernÃ¡ndez HernÃ¡ndez\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Animation, manga (Japanese comic books, and video games are some of the most popular media in Japan. The huge community of fans and amateur creators that concentrate twice a year at the massive event called Comic Market is one expression of this popularity. In this paper I focus on the Japanese culture of amateur manga, anime or other derivative texts, and present analysis of the way in which members relate to media texts and other members, in order to reveal two different orientations towards action within this culture: one that centers on individual activities, and the other on collective participation. To do this, I focus first on the Japanese amateur culture that is often called dÅjin culture to find two basic perspectives. One regards this culture as forming communities or based on social interaction, and the other denies commonality in the relationships between members and stresses individual drive. Then, I focus on a similar distinction that shapes the main discourses concerning Japanese subculture and otaku, both categories within which dÅjin culture can be categorized. Here I pay particular attention to two different orientations towards the value of media texts, which provide a reference for understanding the aforementioned opposition between commonality and individuality. In my conclusions, I suggest that this amateur culture can be regarded as an institution of textual appropriation, shaped by two orientations: activities and participation.Â\n\nJapanese Martial Arts as Popular Culture: Teaching Opportunity and Challenge\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStephen Robert NAGY\n\n2015-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Japanese martial arts, here after Japanese budÅ, are popular cultural icons that are found in films, comics, video games and books. Teaching Japanese budÅ at university offers a novel way to teach about East Asian and in particular Japanese culture, history, and philosophy while including ideas about the globalization and the localization of culture. Question though remains as to how and what should we teach about the popular culture of Japanese budÅ at the university level? This paper found that a comprehensive approach to teaching about budÅ was effective. By using many kinds of materials and the incorporation of opportunities to experience budÅ and to try budÅ, students were better able to grasp the historical, cultural and religious characteristics of budÅ.\n\nMarine biodiversity in Japanese waters.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKatsunori Fujikura\n\nFull Text Available To understand marine biodiversity in Japanese waters, we have compiled information on the marine biota in Japanese waters, including the number of described species (species richness, the history of marine biology research in Japan, the state of knowledge, the number of endemic species, the number of identified but undescribed species, the number of known introduced species, and the number of taxonomic experts and identification guides, with consideration of the general ocean environmental background, such as the physical and geological settings. A total of 33,629 species have been reported to occur in Japanese waters. The state of knowledge was extremely variable, with taxa containing many inconspicuous, smaller species tending to be less well known. The total number of identified but undescribed species was at least 121,913. The total number of described species combined with the number of identified but undescribed species reached 155,542. This is the best estimate of the total number of species in Japanese waters and indicates that more than 70% of Japan's marine biodiversity remains un-described. The number of species reported as introduced into Japanese waters was 39. This is the first attempt to estimate species richness for all marine species in Japanese waters. Although its marine biota can be considered relatively well known, at least within the Asian-Pacific region, considering the vast number of different marine environments such as coral reefs, ocean trenches, ice-bound waters, methane seeps, and hydrothermal vents, much work remains to be done. We expect global change to have a tremendous impact on marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Japan is in a particularly suitable geographic situation and has a lot of facilities for conducting marine science research. Japan has an important responsibility to contribute to our understanding of life in the oceans.\n\nReference Japanese man\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTanaka, Giichiro\n\n1985-01-01\n\nTo make real and accurate dose assessment method so far, it is necessitated to provide ''Reference Japanese Man'' based on anotomical, physiological and biochemical data of Japanese people instead of the Reference Man presented in ICRP Publications 23 and 30. This review describes present status of researched for the purpose of establishing of Reference Japanese Man. The Reference Japanese Man is defined as a male or female adult who lives in Japan with a Japanese life-style and food custom. His stature and body weight, and the other data was decided as mean values of male or female people of Japan. As for food custom, Japanese people take significantly smaller amount of meat and milk products than Western people, while larger intake amount of cereals and marine products such as fish or seaweeds. Weight of organs is a principal factor for internal dose assessment and mean values for living Japanese adult has been investigated and the value employable for dose assessment for organs and tissues are shown. To employ these values of Reference Japanese Man, it should be taken into account of age. Metabolic parameters should also be considered. Iodine metabolism in Japanese is quite different from that of Western people. The above-mentioned data are now tentatively employing in modification of table of MIRD method and others.

This paper summarizes the biographies of 97 Japanese leaders in various medical disciplines during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. These leaders were among the elite of Japan, with superior intellectual, social and economic status, who helped to establish the important attributes of medical professionals in Taiwan, such as a good academic background, heritage, and research skills.\n\nGendered Language in Recent Short Stories by Japanese Women, and in English Translation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLucy Fraser\n\n2008-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article analyses five recent Japanese short stories written by women, with female first person narrators, and the English translations of these stories. I examine how the writers interact with the culturally loaded concept of gendered language to develop characters and themes. The strategies used by translators to render gendered styles into English are also discussed: case-by-case creative solutions appear most effective. âFeminineâ and other gendered styles are used to index social identity, to highlight the difference between the social and inner self, and different styles are mixed together for impact. Gendered styles, therefore, are of central importance and translators wishing to adhere closely to the source text should pay close attention to them. All the narrators of the stories demonstrate an understanding of âsocial sanction and tabooâ. Two accustom themselves to a socially acceptable future, another displays an uneasy attitude to language and convention, while others fall into stereotypes imposed on them or chastise themselves for inappropriate behaviour. The stories illustrate the way in which gendered language styles in Japanese can be manipulated, as both the writers and the characters they create deliberately use different styles for effect.\n\nJapanese authorities inform IAEA about accident at nuclear plant\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFull text: The IAEA today received information from Japanese nuclear regulatory authorities about an accident in the steam generator turbine circuit of the Mihama Nuclear Power Plant (unit 3). According to the Japanese nuclear authorities this is a non-radioactive part of the plant. The regulatory body has reported that four contract employees died and 7 were injured, and stated that there was no release of radioactivity. The IAEA continues to be in contact with Japanese authorities and expects to receive updates on a continuous basis. No request for IAEA assistance has been received at this time.

Nationally representative data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging were analyzed using logistic regression to examine possible risk factors of hip fractures, separately for older women (n = 2,859 and older men (n = 2,108. Results showed that older Japanese women with difficulty bending their knees (OR = 1.9, with diabetes (OR = 1.7 times, and/or with more activity of daily living limitations (OR = 1.1 had higher risks of hip fracture. Older Japanese men with difficulty bending their knees (OR = 2.6, who use more external prescription drugs (OR = 1.9, and with cancer (OR = 2.0 times had higher risks of hip fracture. Further considerations of gender- and culture-specific factors along with the identified risk factors may provide insights into future intervention programs for hip fracture in Japanese older populations.\n\nCluo: Web-Scale Text Mining System For Open Source Intelligence Purposes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPrzemyslaw Maciolek\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The amount of textual information published on the Internet is considered tobe in billions of web pages, blog posts, comments, social media updates andothers.

Additionally, to illustrate the possibilities of our tool, this work also presents an empirical analysis of readability of Brazilian scientific news dissemination.\n\nComparison of the evapotranspiration and its components before and after thinning in Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress forest\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTateishi, Makiko; Xiang, Yang; Matsuda, Hiroki; Saito, Takami; Sun, Haotian; Otsuki, Kyoichi; Kasahara, Tamao; Onda, Yuichi\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWater source area of Japan is often covered by forest, and 40 % of forest cover is coniferous plantation. Thinning has become a major tool in the management of plantation in recent years, but its effects on water cycle and its components are yet to be evaluated well. In this study, we investigated the changes in evapotranspiration and its components, including stand transpiration and canopy interception loss, after thinning in 50 years old Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress plantation at Yayama experimental catchment in Fukuoka, Japan. We established study plot in each Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress stand. Sap flow measurement was conducted for evaluating stand transpiration in each plot. Through fall and stem flow were also monitored to estimate canopy interception loss. The experiments were conducted over two years. During the measurements, 50 % of trees were thinned randomly in entire catchment, which has an area of 2.98 ha. Stem density was changed from 3945 to 1977 trees per ha after thinning. The reduction of daily stand transpiration in the studied Japanese cedar and cypress stands after thinning were 31.6 % and 48.2 % under the same condition of microclimate, respectively. These values were comparable to the changes in total sapwood area, 34.2 % and 44.5 %, and sap flow density did not change after thinning. It implies that sapwood area is a primary determinant of stand transpiration. Canopy interception ratios were 27 % and 26 % for Japanese cedar and cypress before thinning, and the ratios decreased to 24 % and 21 % after thinning, respectively. Thus, we obtained the changes in annual evapotranspiration and its components at catchment scale by using observation and models. The changes in partitioning of evapotranspiration is also discussed. The evapotranspiration before and after thinning were also compared to water balance data in this study site.\n\nAre translations longer than source texts?

S. history. Greg Robinson not only offers a bold new understanding of these events but also studies them within a larger time frame and from a transnational perspective. Drawing on newly discovered material, Robinson provides a backstory of confinement that reveals for the first time the extent of the American government's surveillance of Japanese communities in the years leading up to war and the construction of what officials termed \"concentration camps\" for enemy aliens. He also considers the aftermath of confinement, including the place of Japanese Americans in postwar civil rights struggles, the long movement by former camp inmates for redress, and the continuing role of the camps as touchstones for nationwide commemoration and debate. Most remarkably, A Tragedy of Democracy is the first book to analyze official policy toward West Coast Japanese Americans within a North American context. Robinson studies confinement on the mainland alongside events in wartime Hawaii, where fears of Japanese Americans justified Army dictatorship, suspension of the Constitution, and the imposition of military tribunals. He similarly reads the treatment of Japanese Americans against Canada's confinement of 22,000 citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry from British Columbia. A Tragedy of Democracy recounts the expulsion of almost 5,000 Japanese from Mexico's Pacific Coast and the poignant story of the Japanese Latin Americans who were kidnapped from their homes and interned in the United States. Approaching Japanese confinement as a continental and international phenomenon, Robinson offers a truly kaleidoscopic understanding of its genesis and outcomes.\n\nA Tragedy of Democracy: Japanese Confinement in North America\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGreg Robinson\n\n2010-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The confinement of some 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II, often called the Japanese American internment, has been described as the worst official civil rights violation of modern U.

In three experiments, participants who were native speakers of Japanese, Japanese-learning Chinese, or Chinese without knowledge of the Japanese language were shown two pictures. One picture was of a small object making a small sound, such as a small vase being broken, and the other was of a big object making a big sound, such as a big vase being broken. Participants were presented with two novel onomatopoetic words with voicing contrasts, e.g.,/dachan/vs./tachan/, and were told that each word corresponded to one of the two pictures. They were then asked to match the words to the corresponding pictures. Chinese without knowledge of Japanese performed only at chance level, whereas Japanese and Japanese-learning Chinese successfully matched a voiced/unvoiced consonant with a big/small object respectively. The results suggest that the key to understanding the symbolic values of voicing contrasts in Japanese onomatopoeia is some basic knowledge that is intrinsic to the Japanese language.\n\nJapanese Buddhism, Relativization, and Glocalization\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nUgo DessÃ¬\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Within the field of study on Japanese religions, the issue of globalization tends to be associated with the missionary activities of some successful new religious movements, and there is a certain reluctance to approach analytically the dynamics of glocalization/hybridization and the power issues at stake. In this article, I address these and other related problems by taking my cue from the relativizing effects of globalization and a working definition of religion based on the concept of authority. To this aim, I focus on two case studies. The first concerns the ongoing greening of Japanese Buddhism. The second revolves around the adoption of meditational techniques by priests and lay practitioners in Hawaiian Shin Buddhism. My findings show that there are at least four factors underlying the glocalization of Japanese Buddhism, that is, global consciousness, resonance with the local tradition, decontextualization, and quest for power. Moreover, they indicate that it is possible to distinguish between two types of glocalization (glocalization and chauvinistic glocalization and two configurations of glocalization (juxtaposition and integration.\n\nThe Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDavies, Roger J., Ed.; Ikeno, Osamu, Ed.\n\nThis collection of essays offers an overview of contemporary Japanese culture, and can serve as a resource for classes studying Japan.

Nevertheless, Japanese cinema is never described with the same respect as European and American filmic paradigms.

So why isnât Japanese cinema discussed with the same reverence as above mentioned paradigms? ...\n\nIntellectual Property Creation of Japanese Companies in China and Thailand\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMayasuki Kondo\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available In the age of globalization, Japanese companies are globalizing their operations. They have recently been increasing the number of overseas R&D centers in Asia, especially in China and Thailand. Using the United States patent and industrial design data, the paper finds the following points quantitatively. Japanese companies are increasing the number of patents and industrial designs created in the two countries. They used local talents from the beginning in China for both patents and industrial designs. In Thailand, they used local talents for industrial designs from the beginning, while Japanese expertise in Thailand was used for patents in the beginning. In any case, the role of Japanese in Japan is important. Compared with multi-nationa"
