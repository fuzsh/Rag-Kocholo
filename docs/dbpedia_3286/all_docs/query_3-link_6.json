He is a mutant with animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, a powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, a skeleton reinforced with the unbreakable fictional metal adamantium, significantly delayed aging and a prolonged lifespan, and three retractable claws in each hand. In addition to the X-Men, Wolverine has been depicted as a member of X-Force, Alpha Flight, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers. The common depiction of Wolverine is multifaceted; he is portrayed at once as a gruff loner, susceptible to animalistic \"berserker rages\" despite his best efforts, while simultaneously being an incredibly knowledgeable and intelligent polyglot, strategist, and martial artist, partially due to his extended lifespan and expansive lived experiences. He has been featured in comic books, films, animation, and video games.\n\nThe character first appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 before having a larger role in #181 (cover-dated November 1974), in the Bronze Age of Comic Books. He was created by writer Len Wein[2] and Marvel art director John Romita Sr. Romita designed the character's costume, but the character was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe. Since 2017, Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas has also claimed co-creator credit.[3]\n\nWolverine then joined a revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men; writer Chris Claremont, artist Dave Cockrum, and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the character's development. Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped revise the character with a four-part eponymous limited series, cover-dated from September to December 1982, which debuted Wolverine's catchphrase, \"I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice.\" The subsequent 1991 Weapon X storyline by Barry Windsor-Smith established that Wolverine had received the adamantium grafted to his skeleton in a torturous process conducted by a secret government project intended to create a super soldier, and that this experience led to post-traumatic amnesia.\n\nWolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War;[4]: 265 his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding loner nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by the end of the 1980s.[4]: 277 As a result, the character became a fan favorite of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise,[4]: 263, 265 and has been featured in his own solo Wolverine comic book series since 1988.\n\nWolverine has appeared in most X-Men media adaptations, including animated television series, video games and film. In live action, Hugh Jackman portrayed the character across ten installments of the X-Men film series produced by 20th Century Fox between 2000 and 2017, and reprised the role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024). Henry Cavill portrayed an alternate version of Wolverine dubbed \"Cavillrine\" in Deadpool & Wolverine. Troye Sivan portrayed a young version of Logan in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\n\nPublication history\n\n[edit]\n\nCreation and development\n\n[edit]\n\nMarvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas asked writer Len Wein to devise a character specifically named Wolverine, who was a Canadian of small stature and with a wolverine's fierce temper. John Romita Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, \"When I make a design, I want it to be practical and functional. I thought, 'If a man has claws like that, how does he scratch his nose or tie his shoelaces?'\"[5] Wolverine first appeared in the final \"teaser\" panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 (cover-dated October 1974), written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk #181 (November 1974), again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he \"distinctly remembers\" Romita's sketch and that, \"The way I see it, [Romita and Wein] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life! ... It was just one of those secondary or tertiary characters, actually, that we were using in that particular book with no particular notion of it going anywhere. We did characters in The [Incredible] Hulk all the time that were in [particular] issues and that was the end of them.\"[6] Though often credited as co-creator, Trimpe denied having had any role in Wolverine's creation.[7]\n\nThe character's introduction was ambiguous, revealing little beyond his being a superhuman agent of the Canadian government. In these appearances, he does not retract his claws, although Wein stated they had always been envisioned as retractable.[9] He appears briefly in the finale to this story in The Incredible Hulk #182.\n\nWolverine's next appearance was in 1975's Giant-Size X-Men #1, written by Wein and penciled by Dave Cockrum, in which Wolverine is recruited for a new squad. Gil Kane illustrated the cover artwork but incorrectly drew Wolverine's mask with larger headpieces. Dave Cockrum liked Kane's accidental alteration (he thought the original was too similar to Batman's mask) and incorporated it into his own artwork for the actual story.[10] Cockrum was also the first artist to draw Wolverine without his mask, and the distinctive hairstyle became a trademark of the character.[11]\n\nChris Claremont took the name Logan from Canada's Mount Logan, stating that \"the idea was the tallest mountain being the name of the shortest character\".[12]\n\nA revival of X-Men followed, beginning with X-Men #94 (August 1975), drawn by Cockrum and written by Chris Claremont. In X-Men and Uncanny X-Men, Wolverine is initially overshadowed by the other characters, although he does create tension in the team as he is attracted to Cyclops' girlfriend, Jean Grey. As the series progressed, Claremont and Cockrum (who preferred Nightcrawler[13]) considered dropping Wolverine from the series;[13] Cockrum's successor, artist John Byrne, championed the character, later explaining, as a Canadian himself, he did not want to see a Canadian character dropped.[11][14] Byrne modeled his rendition of Wolverine on actor Paul D'Amato, who played Dr. Hook in the 1977 sports film Slap Shot.[15] Byrne also created Alpha Flight, a group of Canadian superheroes who try to recapture Wolverine due to the expense their government incurred training him. Later stories gradually establish Wolverine's murky past and unstable nature, which he battles to keep in check. Byrne also designed a new brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, but retained the distinctive Cockrum cowl.[16] Cockrum had introduced a new costume for Wolverine (taken from his adversary Fang) in the final issue of his run, but it was dropped one issue into Byrne's run because he and Cockrum alike found it painfully difficult to draw.[17]\n\nWolverine's first intended origin\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite suggestions that co-creator Len Wein originally intended for Logan to be a mutated wolverine cub, evolved to humanoid form by an already established Marvel geneticist, the High Evolutionary,[18] Wein denies this:\n\nWhile I readily admit that my original idea was for Wolvie's claws to extend from the backs of his gloves ... I absolutely did not ever intend to make Logan a mutated wolverine. I write stories about human beings, not evolved animals (with apologies for any story I may have written that involved the High Evolutionary). The mutated wolverine thing came about long after I was no longer involved with the book. I'm not certain if the idea was first suggested by Chris Claremont, the late, much-missed Dave Cockrum, or John Byrne when he came aboard as artist, but it most certainly did not start with me.[9]\n\nWein said on the X-Men Origins: Wolverine Blu-ray special features that he has read \"Ten things you did not know about Wolverine\", which says the character was originally intended to be a mutated wolverine cub, and that this rekindled Wein's frustration. He again stated that he had \"always known that Wolverine was a mutant.\"\n\nIn an article about the evolution of Wolverine included in a 1986 reprint of The Incredible Hulk #180–181, titled Incredible Hulk and Wolverine, Cockrum said he considered having the High Evolutionary play a vital role in making Wolverine a human.[11] Writer Wein wanted Wolverine to be the age of a young adult, with superhuman strength and agility similar to Spider-Man. This changed when Wein saw Cockrum's drawing of the unmasked Wolverine as a hairy 40-year-old.[11] Wein originally intended the claws to be retractable and part of Wolverine's gloves, and both gloves and claws would be made of adamantium.[9] Chris Claremont eventually revealed that they were an integrated part of Wolverine's anatomy in X-Men #98 (April 1976). Writer Jeph Loeb used a similar origin for Wolverine in the Marvel continuity, having feral mutants be an evolved lifeform.[19]\n\nWolverine's second intended origin\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Byrne said, both in interviews and on his website, that he drew a possible face for Wolverine, but then learned that Dave Cockrum had already drawn him unmasked in X-Men #98 (April 1976), long before Byrne's run on the series.[20][21] Later, Byrne used the drawing for the face of Sabretooth, an enemy of the martial artist superhero Iron Fist, whose stories Chris Claremont was writing. Byrne then conceived of the idea of Sabretooth being Wolverine's father.[22][23] Together, Byrne and Claremont came up with Wolverine being about 60 years old and having served in World War II after escaping from Sabretooth, who was about 120 years old.[22]\n\nCommercial success\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing Byrne's departure, Wolverine remained as a prominent character in X-Men, which later changed its name to Uncanny X-Men. Cockrum returned for a longer, monthly run and afterwards Paul Smith, John Romita Jr., Marc Silvestri and Jim Lee were frequent artists on this series.[24] He remained a significant protagonist in this series until Chris Claremont left the title to write the new X-Men (vol. 2) and Wolverine transitioned to this new series.\n\nThe character's growing popularity led to a solo, four-issue series, Wolverine (September–December 1982), by Claremont and Frank Miller. Elliott Serrano, a comic writer and commentator, argues that this series was particularly significant in establishing the character's popularity: \"Before Claremont and Miller created the Wolverine series, Logan wasn't a key figure, but the creation of this series is when Wolverine became Marvel's Batman.\"\n\nIn this period, Wolverine's appearance and characterization were particularly influenced by the film roles of Clint Eastwood, particularly the Revisionist Western antihero films featuring the Man with No Name. This inspiration continued to be significant throughout the development of the character and his adaptations.[26]\n\nThe mini-series was followed by the six-issue Kitty Pryde and Wolverine by Claremont and Al Milgrom (Nov. 1984 – April 1985). Marvel launched an ongoing solo book written by Claremont with art by John Buscema in November 1988. It ran for 189 issues. Larry Hama later took over the series and had an extensive run. In the early 1990s, the series was usually illustrated by Marc Silvestri. During this period, Wolverine also regularly appeared in cover stories for the anthology series Marvel Comics Presents. Among these stories was \"Weapon X\", by writer-artist Barry Windsor-Smith, serialized in Marvel Comics Presents #72–84 (1991), which was an essential depiction of Wolverine's past and the event of adamantium grafted to his skeleton. Subsequent stories in this publication were often illustrated by Sam Kieth and had a more psychedelic aesthetic and storytelling style.\n\nOther writers who wrote for the two Wolverine ongoing series include Peter David, Archie Goodwin, Erik Larsen, Frank Tieri, Greg Rucka, Mark Millar, and Gregg Hurwitz. Many artists have also worked on the series, including John Byrne, Gene Colan, Marc Silvestri, Mark Texeira, Adam Kubert, Leinil Francis Yu, Rob Liefeld, Sean Chen, Darick Robertson, John Romita Jr., Joe Madureira, and Humberto Ramos.\n\nIn the 1990s, Wolverine featured as a prominent character in X-Men vol. 2, initially written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Jim Lee. The first issue of this comic book series is the highest selling comic book in history.[27] Following the departure of Claremont and Lee, Scott Lobdell usually wrote the title while Andy Kubert illustrated it.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the character was revealed to have bone claws, after his adamantium is ripped out by Magneto in X-Men (Vol 2) #25, which was inspired by a passing joke of Peter David's.[28]\n\nSales for X-Men comics declined somewhat at the turn of the 21st century, and Grant Morrison was hired to revive interest in the characters, including Wolverine, by means of the more experimental New X-Men. Frank Quitely and Chris Bachalo drew many of these issues, as well as a returning Mark Silvestri. Subsequently, he featured in the Astonishing X-Men series initially written by Joss Whedon and illustrated by John Cassaday.\n\nAt the turn of the century, in addition to the Wolverine series and appearances in the various X-Men series, another publication expanded upon the character's past: Origin, a six-issue limited series by co-writers Joe Quesada, Paul Jenkins, and Bill Jemas and artist Andy Kubert (Nov. 2001 – July 2002). A second solo series, Wolverine: Origins, written by Daniel Way with art by Steve Dillon, spun off of, and ran concurrently with, the second Wolverine solo series.\n\nFollowing Larry Hama's exit from the Wolverine solo title, Mark Millar became a particularly influential writer for the character. In 2008, he and artist Steve McNiven explored a possible future for Wolverine in an eight-issue story arc entitled \"Old Man Logan\" that debuted with Wolverine #66.[29] Wolverine appeared as a regular character throughout both the 2010–2013 Avengers series and the 2010–2013 New Avengers series.\n\nFictional character biography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life and backstory\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine was born as James Howlett in northern Alberta, Canada (approximately near Cold Lake), during the late 19th century, purportedly to rich farm owners John and Elizabeth Howlett,[30] though he is actually the illegitimate son of the Howletts' groundskeeper, Thomas Logan.[31] After Thomas is thrown off the Howletts' property for an attempted rape perpetrated by his other son, named simply Dog, he returns to the Howlett manor and kills John Howlett. In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge from the back of his hands, as his mutation manifests.[32] He flees with his childhood companion, Rose, and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon, adopting the name \"Logan\".[33] When Logan accidentally kills Rose with his claws, he flees the colony and lives in the wilderness among wolves,[34] until he is captured and placed in a circus.[35] Saul Creed, brother of Victor Creed, frees Logan, but after he betrays Logan and Clara Creed to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex's potion.[36] Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth,[37] he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I.\n\nDuring World War II, Logan teams up with Captain America[38] and continues a career as a mercenary. He serves with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion[39] during D-Day, and later with the CIA before being recruited by Team X, a black ops unit. Sometime after WWII and before joining Team X, Logan spends time in Madripoor before settling in Japan, where he marries Itsu. While Logan is away from home, Romulus sends the Winter Soldier to kill the pregnant Itsu and has her baby taken from her womb; the boy would later become Daken. Logan believes his son to be dead for many years.\n\nAs a member of Team X, Logan is given false memory implants. Eventually breaking free of this mental control, he joins the Canadian Defense Ministry. Logan is subsequently kidnapped by the Weapon X program, where he remains captive and experimented on, until he escapes.[40] It is during his imprisonment by Weapon X that he has adamantium forcibly fused onto his bones. James and Heather Hudson help him recover his humanity following his escape, and Logan begins work as an intelligence operative for the Canadian government's Department H.\n\n1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nHe becomes Wolverine, one of Canada's first superheroes. In his first mission, he is dispatched to stop the destruction caused by a brawl between the Hulk and the Wendigo.[41]\n\nAfter the Canadian government failed to capture Hulk, Wolverine is forced to team-up with Living Diamond to infiltrate Brand Corporation, where they are briefly caught by Mesmero and a mysterious masked mutant Wildlife, who is actually an amnesiac Beast, the former X-Men member, until the arrival of former Secret Empire agent, Linda Donaldson recovers Beast's memories. Wolverine kills Living Diamond for killing both Beast and Linda. Before taking Mesmero away, as Wolverine's old mask was heavily damaged, Wolverine takes Beast's Wildlife mask, which then becomes his iconic mask he uses through years.[42]\n\nLater, Professor Charles Xavier recruits Wolverine to a new iteration of his superhero-mutant team, the X-Men, along with Banshee, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Colossus. He competes with Cyclops for the affection of Jean Grey.[43] It was later revealed that Wolverine had been sent to assassinate Xavier, who wiped Logan's memories and forced him to join the X-Men.[44]\n\nX-Men #100 introduces the fastball special, a combat maneuver in which the super-strong Colossus throws Wolverine at a distance as if he were a projectile weapon. This tactic recurs in many future battles.[45]\n\n1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn The Dark Phoenix Saga, Jean Grey apparently sacrifices herself after transforming into the Phoenix Force, thereby temporarily ending the love triangle among herself, Wolverine, and Cyclops. While his teammates often distrust him, Wolverine is invaluable in rescuing the others and defeating their enemies, particularly in their conflict with the Hellfire Club.\n\nIn this decade his new X-Men teammates included Longshot, Dazzler, and Rogue.[46] He becomes engaged to Mariko Yashida and battles The Hand.[47] However, the engagement is broken because of the intervention of a member of the Hellfire Club. He becomes a close defender and mentor for Kitty Pryde. He battles Sabretooth during the Mutant Massacre story line,[48] though he later discovers that he had many previous interactions with Sabretooth that his traumatic amnesia concealed. Separate from the X-Men, he has adventures in Madripoor disguised as his alter ego \"Patch.\"\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nHe is a mentor for Jubilee. When the X-Men split into two different subgroups, he participates in the \"Blue Team\" along with Cyclops, Rogue, Beast, Gambit, and Psylocke. Jean Grey had been resurrected by this point, leading to resumption of his rivalry with Cyclops.[volume & issue needed]\n\nHe also discovers some aspects of the trauma and brainwashing he received from the Weapon X program, although his memories remain unreliable. He meets Maverick, another former participant in the Weapon X project, and discovers that he had previously worked together with Sabretooth in a covert team subsequent to the project.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn X-Men #25 (1993), at the culmination of the \"Fatal Attractions\" storyline, the supervillain Magneto forcibly removes the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton. This massive trauma causes his healing factor to burn out and also leads to the discovery that his claws are actually bone. Wolverine leaves the X-Men for a time, embarking on a series of adventures during which his healing factor returns. Feral by nature, Wolverine's mutation process will eventually cause him to degenerate physically into a more primitive, bestial state.[49] Elektra helps him to recover his humanity.[volume & issue needed]\n\nAfter his return to the X-Men, Cable's son Genesis kidnaps Wolverine and attempts to re-bond adamantium to his skeleton.[50] This is unsuccessful and causes Wolverine's mutation to accelerate out of control. He is temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form. Eventually, the villain Apocalypse captures Wolverine, brainwashes him into becoming the Horseman Death, and successfully re-bonds adamantium to his skeleton. Wolverine overcomes Apocalypse's programming and returns to the X-Men.[volume & issue needed]\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nJean Grey becomes again possessed by the Phoenix Force, and Wolverine has no other choice but to kill her with his claws.\n\nWolverine learns about the existence of X-23. He initially believes her to be a clone, raised to be a perfect assassin.[51] X-23 later goes by the name Laura. She is eventually enrolled at the Xavier Institute, with her true origin being kept secret as Logan's way of protecting her.[52] Despite being introduced as Wolverine's \"sister\", she quickly accepts Wolverine as a father figure.[53] She eventually learns that he is actually her biological father.[54]\n\nIn the Enemy of the State story line, Wolverine is brainwashed by the Hand.[55] He battles Elektra, S.H.I.E.L.D., and the Fantastic Four.[56][57] He also attacks the X-Mansion and kills Northstar.[58] Wolverine is captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and submitted to VR reprogramming.[59] He turns against the Hand.[60]\n\nIn the House of M story line, Scarlet Witch drastically transforms reality. As a consequence, Wolverine is able to recall memories of his previous life, overcoming his previous traumatic amnesia.[61]\n\nIn Wolverine: Origins, the character's second solo series, Wolverine discovers that he has a son named Daken, who has been brainwashed and made a living weapon. Wolverine then makes it his mission to rescue Daken.[62]\n\nDuring the events of the \"Messiah Complex\" storyline, Cyclops orders Wolverine to reform X-Force.[63] Wolverine and the team (initially consisting of X-23, Warpath, and Wolfsbane) starred in a new monthly title.[64] In the \"Messiah War\", Cyclops ends the X-Force program,[volume & issue needed] but Wolverine continues a new Uncanny X-Force team in secrecy with Angel/Archangel, Psylocke, Deadpool and Fantomex.[65]\n\nWolverine splits with Cyclops and opens a new school in Westchester, New York, the \"Jean Grey School for Higher Learning\".[66] Around half of all the mutants on Utopia accompany Wolverine to Westchester to be a part of the new school. He appoints himself as the headmaster, Kitty Pryde as the co-headmistress, Hank McCoy as the vice-principal, and various other characters are appointed as the school's staff.[67]\n\n2010s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Avengers vs. X-Men the Phoenix Force returns to Earth and this produces conflict between the X-Men and the Avengers, and Wolverine takes the side of the Avengers.[68] Cyclops becomes possessed by the Phoenix Force and kills Professor X. In Uncanny Avengers Wolverine gives a eulogy at the funeral of Professor X, in which he admits that he wanted to kill Cyclops.[69] He becomes a member of the Avengers Unity Squad, a team created by Captain America in which X-Men and Avengers work together.[70]\n\nIn the \"Death of Wolverine\" story line, a virus turns off Wolverine's healing factor. Wolverine determines that Doctor Abraham Cornelius, the founder of the Weapon X program, has placed a bounty on his head. Wolverine gets covered in adamantium after confronting him, and dies from suffocation.[71] Wanting to possess Logan, Ogun finds his dead body.[72]\n\nThe aftermath of Wolverine's death is explored in the series Wolverines.[73] The \"Wolverines\" (a team formed from the fallout of his death by Daken, Lady Deathstrike, Mystique, Sabretooth, and X-23) try to find Logan's adamantium-covered body, which is taken by Mister Sinister.[74]\n\nX-23 begins wearing a variation of Wolverine's costume and adopts his codename.[75]\n\nIn Marvel Legacy #1, the time-displaced Jean Grey discovers the adamantium shell in Wolverine's grave has been cracked open and is empty.[76] The X-Men set up Wolverine's 'public' grave in the cabin and were able to get his body out of the adamantium shell by having Kitty phase his corpse out of it, subsequently burying him in a secret location in Canada while leaving the shell as a site for others to attend in memorial of him. The shell is cracked when the Reavers attempt to steal Wolverine's corpse and shortly after that attack, Kitty visits the 'real' grave and realizes that it is empty. Kitty contacts Daredevil and Tony Stark for help finding who took Wolverine, but all are left concerned at the questions of who would even know the location of the true grave- which was known only by a few key X-Men- and whether Wolverine was stolen or 'woke up' on his own as the X-Men also began their investigation, leaving the time-displaced Jean Grey alone in the cabin.[77] At the same time, some of Wolverine's worst enemies hear what happened and join the hunt.[78]\n\nThe Return of Wolverine miniseries focusing on Wolverine's resurrection opens with Wolverine having been brought back to life in an amnesic state by an unidentified force. He eventually realizes that he was brought back to life by Persephone.[79]\n\nWolverine joins the X-Men to attack the Orchis's Mother Mold solar orbiting space station. As Wolverine and Nightcrawler volunteer for a suicide mission to teleport into the vacuum of space. The two longtime friends then say their goodbyes to each other, with Nightcrawler assuring Wolverine that he will be welcomed into heaven. As Nightcrawler is disintegrated, Wolverine's body immediately ignites into flames and he and the Mother Mold are vaporized as they fall into the Sun.[80] Wolverine, along with the rest of the X-Men who perished in the attack on the Mother Mold space station, are then resurrected in the Arbor Magus' hatchery on the Pacific island of Krakoa using a new 48 hour cloning process. In this era, the X-Men have learned how to resurrect any mutant who has died.[81][82] Forge, using Krakoan-Transmode cybernetics inside the island's armory, provided the Adamantium and the skeletal bonding process.[83]\n\n2020s\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine has been resurrected and equipped with an Adamantium skeleton no less than 10 times, having died in battle against Orchis's Nimrod at least 9 times,[84] and has grudgingly allowed for one of his clones to be created without Cerebro's memory upload and to be genetically modified with phosphorescent blood to be fed upon by Dracula and his vampires.[85]\n\nDuring the \"Hellfire Gala\" storyline, Wolverine decides to spend time with his biological daughter Laura Kinney/X-23, and her clone Gabby/Scout, his biological son Daken, and also Kate Pryde and Jubilee. On the evening of the party, Wolverine and several members of X-Force are assigned positions as security. He and Domino then suddenly find themselves in a fight against Deadpool, who attempts to gatecrash the party.[66] Meanwhile, Beast's telefloronic programming on the Terra Verdan ambassador is hacked and starts attacking the party.[86]\n\nIn the X Lives of Wolverine and X Deaths of Wolverine story event, Wolverine travels in time to save the life of an important figure to the mutant race. In the midst of his travels, Wolverine will relive certain moments from his own long-forgotten past as well. Upon revisiting the past, is revealed that Wolverine was present during the birth of Charles Xavier and indirectly Cassandra Nova, having saved his family from an invading Omega Red, when the Russian mutant possessed some of Xavier family's butlers and nurse.[87]\n\nDuring the Judgment Day storyline, Wolverine was with the Quiet Council when Jack of Knives leads the attack on Krakoa. After killing some opponents, Wolverine finds Egg badly wounded and takes an attack from Jack of Knives as he tells Jean Grey to have the Five protected. After the opponents retreat, Wolverine learns from Nightcrawler on what Uranos the Undying did on Arrako.[88]\n\nPersonality and themes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe essence of (Logan's) character (is) a \"failed samurai\". To Samurai, duty is all, selfless service the path to their ultimate ambition, death with grace. - Chris Claremont[89]\n\nChris Claremont says that he drew some of his characterization of Wolverine from Conan the Barbarian, declaring that \"Wolverine in his essence is a lot closer to Conan than any other Marvel hero we have.\"[90] He also compared Wolverine to Hulk, because of his tendency to lapse into a \"berserker rage\" while in close combat. In this state, he lashes out with the intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack.[91] Though he loathes it, he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times, it being most notably useful when he faced the telepathic \"Mister X\", as X's ability to read his mind and predict his next move in a fight was useless as not even Wolverine knows what he will do next in his berserk state.[91] Despite his apparent ease at taking lives, he mournfully regrets and does not enjoy killing or giving in to his berserker rages. Logan adheres to a firm code of personal honor and morality, and he generally only responds in a violent or deadly manner to enemies attacking him with deadly force. He often tries to restrict killing to a \"last resort,\" though he will often respond to deadly force with deadly force.[92]\n\nWolverine is frequently depicted as a gruff loner, often taking leave from the X-Men to deal with personal issues or problems. He is often irreverent and rebellious towards authority figures, though he is a reliable ally and capable leader, and has occasionally displayed a wry, sarcastic sense of humor.\n\nPsychologist Suzana E. Flores writes that Wolverine demonstrates clinical psychological symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, antisocial personality disorder, dissociative disorder, and even sociopathy, but does so in a way that can be understood and empathized. She interprets his origin story as a depiction of complex childhood trauma, and its effects of dissociative amnesia and hypervigilance.\n\nLarry Yarbrough, a clinical psychologist and Navy veteran, says that some of Wolverine's personality traits are typical of combat veterans: \"The violent/kind demeanor of vets who witnessed war is paradoxical. Logan has an extremely reactive temper, but he's also a kind person. The violent mood swings are a symptom of trauma, not a reflection of his character.\"\n\nYarbrough also observes Wolverine's habitual smoking and drinking, as coping mechanisms for this experience of trauma. In addition, Wolverine practices zazen sitting meditation to maintain self-control and restore mental health.[96]\n\nPowers and abilities\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology.\n\nHealing and defensive powers\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant healing factor, that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond that of normal humans. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs and toxins. However, he can still suffer the immediate effects of such substances in massive quantities; he has been seen to become intoxicated after ingesting significant amounts of alcohol,[97] and has been incapacitated on several occasions with large amounts of powerful drugs and poisons;[98] S.H.I.E.L.D. once managed to keep Wolverine anesthetized by constantly pumping eighty milliliters of anesthetic a minute into his system.[59]\n\nA study by the University of British Columbia states that Wolverine's healing factor resembles the axolotl's ability to regenerate lost limbs. It suggests that a novel protein—which the study's authors dubbed Howlett—found in tissue samples taken from him, and which resembles the Amblox protein found in axolotl but is much more efficient, is responsible for Wolverine's rapid regeneration.[99] His healing factor allowed him to survive the experimental surgical binding of the virtually indestructible metal adamantium to his bones and claws, to which he was subjected under the Weapon X program (in later comics called the Weapon Plus program). While the adamantium in his body prevents or reduces many injuries, such as broken bones and decapitation, his healing factor must also work constantly to prevent metal poisoning from killing him. When his healing powers were rendered inactive, Beast synthesized a drug to counteract the adamantium poisoning.[100]\n\nWolverine's healing factor also dramatically affects his aging process, allowing him to live far beyond the normal lifespan of normal humans. Despite being born in the late 19th century,[101] he has the appearance, conditioning, health and vitality of a man in his physical prime. While seemingly ageless, it is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy.\n\nAlthough Wolverine's body heals, the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured.[102] Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries.[103] He does not enjoy being hurt and sometimes has to work himself up for situations where extreme pain is certain.[104][105] Wolverine, on occasion, has deliberately injured himself or allowed himself to be injured for varying reasons, including freeing himself from capture,[106] intimidation,[107] strategy,[108] or simply indulging his feral nature.[109][110][111] Though he now has all of his memories, his healing abilities can provide increased recovery from psychological trauma by suppressing memories in which he experiences profound distress.[112]\n\nDepictions of the speed and extent of injury to which Wolverine can heal vary due to a broad degree of artistic license employed by various comic book writers. Originally, this was portrayed as accelerated healing of minor wounds,[113] though Chris Claremont, head writer of the X-Men comics from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s increased Wolverine's healing factor substantially, though not nearly as much as later writers would. During the 1980s, Wolverine's mutant healing factor is depicted as being able to heal massive levels of trauma, though his recovery time could extend to days, weeks or months before fully healing; often depending upon the severity of the injuries, their extent and the frequency with which they are inflicted.[114][115][116] Wolverine has also stated that his body actually heals faster when the injury is grave or life-threatening.[117] During the 1990s through the modern era, other writers have increased Wolverine's healing factor to the point that it could fully regenerate nearly any damaged or destroyed bodily tissues within seconds.[118][119][120] Among the more extreme depictions of Wolverine's healing factor include fully healing after being caught near the center of an atomic explosion[121] and the total regeneration of his soft body tissue, within a matter of minutes, after having it incinerated from his skeleton.[122] An explanation is given in a recent mini-series starring Wolverine for the increase of his healing powers. In the series, Wolverine is referred to as an \"adaptive self-healer\" after undergoing numerous traumatic injuries to test the efficiency of his healing factor. Wolverine has endured so much trauma, and so frequently, that his healing factor has adapted, becoming faster and more efficient to cope with increasing levels of trauma.[123] The Xavier Protocols, a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, say that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to \"incredible levels\" and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to decapitate him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.[124]\n\nIt is possible to suppress the efficiency of Wolverine's healing powers; for example, if an object composed of adamantium is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically.[125] The Muramasa blade, a katana of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine's powers.[126] It has also been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning that if he was seriously injured and malnourished, his body might not be able to repair itself.[127] His healing factor has also been turned off using nanites.[128] On one occasion, Wolverine finds himself temporarily deprived of his healing factor, with the scientist and X-Man Beast revealing that an \"intelligent virus\" originating from the Microverse had shut off Wolverine’s healing factor (though not before it purged his body of the virus), leaving him as susceptible to injury, disease, and aging as any ordinary human.[100]\n\nIt has been suggested that Wolverine can be killed by drowning.[129] He has said that he is not particularly fond of being in the water, due partially to the weight of his adamantium laced skeleton, and that he can die if held underwater long enough - his healing factor would only prolong the agony.[130] The two-part story arc \"Drowning Logan\" finds Wolverine trapped underwater for an extensive period of time.[131] The second part of the story arc hints that this experience weakens his healing factor and future health.[132]\n\nDue to a combination of Wolverine's healing factor and high-level psionic shields implanted by Professor Xavier, Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing.[133] Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as \"mental scar tissue\" created by the traumatic events of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as Emma Frost.[134]\n\nWhile it is not clear whether this is an actual canon event or simply a hallucination, Wolverine vol. 3, #57 reveals that, when Wolverine is injured so seriously that his body actually dies before his healing factor can repair the damage, he returns to life by fighting with Azrael, the Angel of Death, while trapped in Purgatory because Wolverine defeated Azrael in real-world combat during World War I.[135] However, after Wolverine's resurrection and brainwashing by the Hand, he made a new deal with Azrael that repaired the damage to his soul, negated their previous arrangement, and weakened his healing factor slightly - and the next time Wolverine sustains death-inducing injuries, he will remain dead.[136]\n\nOther abilities\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including superhuman senses, such as an increased sense of smell and hearing; pronounced, sharp, fang-like canines; and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,[137] the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body.[138] The claws are not made of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.[139] During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.[140]\n\nWolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. A perfect example is him being able to hear the heartbeats of hostile living things before conflict begins.[141]\n\nWolverine is able to use his sense of smell to easily remember and track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take.[142] Through concentration, he is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing as a type of natural lie detector, such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.[143][144] Wolverine's sense of smell and hearing also allows him to detect danger from considerable distances by being able to smell any weapons being carried by other living things and machines at least within a block radius and to hear particular disturbances or indications of an impending attack prior to their occurrence. For instance, in many cases he has been depicted as smelling the gun oil, gun powder, smokeless powder, or specific metal scent emanating from a concealed or distant gun or other weapon prior to an attack, as well as hearing the increased heart rate and smelling the increased perspiration of an individual preparing to attack. On one occasion, he is made aware of several yakuza members waiting for him outside of a bar by picking up the scent of their gun oil, the smell of their tattoo ink, and the smell of the daikon they ate before arriving.[145] On another occasion, his acute sense of smell even allows him to detect the presence of X-23 sneaking around the outside grounds of Xavier Institute, by way of the wind shifting - despite him being indoors.[146]\n\nOn more than one occasion, Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, has been molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material, including most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and Captain America's shield, which is made out of a proto-adamantium-vibranium alloy. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. His claws can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures.[147] The adamantium also adds weight to his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities.[114] However, his adamantium skeleton makes him highly susceptible to magnetic-based attacks.[148] The full extent of this is revealed during a battle with Magneto, where the latter destabilizes the adamantium on a molecular level, and proceeds to rip it from his body.[149][150] According to Reed Richards, Wolverine would be unable to move without his enhanced strength due to the additional weight of the adamantium bonded to his skeleton.[151]\n\nWolverine's healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point that he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers.[152] Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.[153][154] Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury.[155] This, coupled with the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium,[156] grants him some degree of superhuman strength.[citation needed] Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton.[154] He has been depicted breaking steel chains,[157][158][159][160] lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall,[155] lifting Ursa Major (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room,[161] and hauling a concert grand piano, and the platform it rests on, via a harness, while climbing a sheer cliff.[162] Colossus and other allies use Wolverine's endurance and strength when throwing him at high speed in the Fastball Special.\n\nDuring and after the Return of Wolverine, he showcased a mysterious new ability where the adamantium in his claws can heat up to incredibly high, yet undisclosed, level of temperatures.[163] The mechanics of this power have yet to be revealed; whether it is a Secondary Mutation, latent Weapon X faculty making itself known or a new power gained upon his resurrection is unclear.[164] What is extent is that it is related to the berserker side of his persona, his Hot Claws as popularly noted being tied to Wolverine's rage.[165] This new power comes with the drawback of weakening his healing factor, however, as after using them to ward off the X-Men who came looking for him, he lost consciousness for a few weeks time afterward.[166]\n\nSkills\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring Wolverine's time in Japan and other countries, he became proficient in many forms of martial arts, with experience in many different fighting styles. He is proficient with most weaponry, including firearms, though he is partial to bladed weapons. He has demonstrated sufficient skills to defeat expert martial artist Shang-Chi[167] and Captain America[168] in single combat. He also has a wide knowledge of the body and pressure points.[169] Like many of the X-Men, he is trained to pilot the group's SR-71 Blackbird supersonic plane.[170] He is highly skilled in the field of espionage and covert operations.[citation needed]\n\nIn contrast to his brutish nature, Wolverine is extremely knowledgeable. Due in part to his longer lifespan, he has traveled around the world and amassed extensive knowledge of foreign languages and cultures, being fluent or near fluent in Japanese, Russian, Spanish, French, Blackfoot, and German, among other languages. He is particularly fluent in Japanese due in part to his significant time spent in Japan and his relationship with Mariko Yashida.\n\nSupporting cast\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine was originally introduced as an antagonist of the Hulk. Subsequently, he became a member of the X-Men and has had extensive interactions with all of them and their associates. In particular, he has a complex ambivalent relationship with Cyclops, for whom he was initially a rival for the affections of Jean Grey.\n\nHe has been a mentor and father figure to several younger women, especially Jubilee, Kitty Pryde and X-23.\n\nEnemies\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine's prominent enemies include Sabretooth, the Hellfire Club, Viper (Madame Hydra), and Lady Deathstrike.\n\nRomantic interests\n\n[edit]\n\nHis first love was Rose O'Hara, a close friend who did not reciprocate his affection. She died accidentally at his hands when she intervened in Wolverine's adolescent fight with an adversary, Dog. Subsequently, he had a long relationship with Silver Fox. He had an intimate relationship with Mariko Yashida and had a failed engagement to her.[175] Mariko was eventually poisoned by The Hand and Wolverine had no choice but to kill her in order to spare her a long agony. He also had a mutual,[177] but unfulfilled attraction to Jean Grey, leading to arguments with her boyfriend (and later husband), Scott Summers. He also married Viper as part of a debt,[178] then later divorced her.[179] It has also been implied that he and Squirrel Girl had a relationship at some point in the past.[180] Wolverine has had an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with longtime teammate and friend, Storm.[181][182] He also had romantic relationships with Yukio, Domino, Mystique, and Elektra.[184]\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nHe has had two children: His daughter, X-23, and his son, Daken.\n\nCultural impact and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nStatus as anti-hero\n\n[edit]\n\nWolverine was groundbreaking among comic book superheroes in demonstrating the traits of an antihero. As Suzana Flores describes it, an antihero is \"often psychologically damaged, simultaneously depicted as superior due to his superhuman abilities and inferior due to his impetuousness, irrationality, or lack of thoughtful evaluation.\" Subsequent to Wolverine's appearance, many more such antiheroes have become popular in comic books, such as Punisher, Marv, Spawn, and Deadpool.\n\nMental health analysis\n\n[edit]\n\nPsychologist Suzana E. Flores has identified that Wolverine's extraordinary popularity partly stems from his illustration of various mental health challenges, particularly recovery from major trauma or psychological trauma. She argues that his first formative trauma was his poor relationship with his mother, who was unable to properly attach to him because she lost her first son. In adulthood, he also suffered the trauma of torture by the Weapon X program. While the character is usually physically invincible, he demonstrates emotional and psychological vulnerability. He exemplifies values and aspirations of resilience for his audience. His fan base is primarily men, and generally he exemplifies a masculine perspective on recovery from trauma. However, Flores says that she also found the character therapeutic in her own recovery from rape.[189] Nnedi Okorafor, a Nigerian American science-fiction author, also writes that Wolverine was a therapeutic role model for her during her experience of paralysis following surgical treatment of scoliosis.[190]\n\nQueer appeal and fandom\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile Wolverine has been primarily depicted as straight in mainstream Marvel continuity,[191] the character has as of 2020 been hinted to be in a polyamorous relationship with Jean Grey and Cyclops.[193] Prior to this, Wolverine's relationship with Cyclops had often been acknowledged as homoerotic in both the comics,[194] and in media adaptations.[195] According to David Caballero of Comic Book Resources (CBR), the live-action film series \"did a considerable yet unintentional job encouraging the ship\", which is one of the most popular X-Men-related ships on the fanfiction website Archive of Our Own.[196] It has been argued that one of the reasons for the pairing's popularity is that \"enemies-to-lovers stories remain a popular source of romantic entertainment\".[196]\n\nOutside of his relationship with Cyclops, Screen Rant's Alex Schlesinger has argued that taking into account their history in comics, there is \"some precedent set for Wolverine and Nightcrawler to be in an intimate relationship together\".[191] The X-Treme X-Men (2012–2013) series featured an alternate version of Wolverine who was in a relationship with Hercules,[197] and the two characters shared an on-panel kiss in issue #10.[198][199]\n\nIn 2012, ComicsAlliance assembled a panel consisting of various LGBT cartoonists, writers, editors, and journalists, to vote on which comics and characters had the biggest impact on them. As a group, the X-Men came in 13th place, with science fiction author and Doom Patrol writer Rachel Pollack stating that \"the X-Men's themes are indelibly queer\".[200] Wolverine was one of the individual X-Men singled out by many panel members as being of great importance to them, with some of the reasons provided being that he is \"inspirational\",[200] while for others being their \"first crush\" as young queer comic readers.[200]\n\nWriting for Bleeding Cool, comics writer and columnist Rich Johnston described Wolverine as a \"gay icon amongst many\",[201] arguing that this was the case before Hugh Jackman first played the character in the live-action film series.[201] Hannah Collins of CBR also described Wolverine as a gay icon and argued that his appeal to queer fans is \"largely invisible to heterosexual fans\".[202] Collins also described Wolverine's muscular physique as similar to that of \"the idealized men found [in] 'Bara' manga\".[202] Bara is genre of Japanese manga focusing on male same-sex love, created primarily by gay men for a gay male audience,[203] and typically features masculine men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair.[204] Echoing Collins' statement over the character's body, Ray Kampf described Wolverine in The Bear Handbook as an example of a bear in animation, with a contributor in the book who is gay admitting his attraction to the character growing up.\n\nWolverine #6 (2003), written by Greg Rucka, features a cover drawn by Esad Ribić.[192] The cover depicts Wolverine sitting on a chair, drinking beer, and staring at Nightcrawler.[192] Screen Rant notes how Nightcrawler is depicted in the nude, and that Wolverine is suggestively staring at his penis,[191] with CBR also noting that the beer he is holding resembling an erection.[192] According to Rucka, Ribić intentionally made the cover suggestive.[191] Collins described the cover as helping \"bring [Wolverine's queer appeal] to mainstream attention\".[202] According to Rucka, Ribić intentionally made the cover \"salacious\", finding comedy in the fact that \"nobody at Marvel noticed\".[191]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Wizard magazine ranked Wolverine 1st in their \"200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time\" list.[208]\n\nIn 2008, Empire ranked Wolverine 4th in their \"50 Greatest Comic Book Characters\" list.[209]\n\nIn 2011, IGN ranked Wolverine 4th in their \" Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\" list.[210]\n\nIn 2012, IGN ranked Wolverine 5th in their \"Top 50 Avengers\" list.[211]\n\nIn 2014, Entertainment Weekly ranked Wolverine 1st in their \"Let's rank every X-Man ever\" list.[212]\n\nIn 2014, BuzzFeed ranked Wolverine 2nd in their \"95 X-Men Members Ranked From Worst To Best\" list.[213]\n\nIn 2018, CBR.com ranked Wolverine 2nd in their \"X-Force: 20 Powerful Members\" list,[214] Wolverine's Weapon X / Weapon Omega persona 20th in their \"Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel's Coolest Alternate World\" list,[215] and Wolverine 28th in their \"30 Strongest Marvel Superheroes\" list.[216]\n\nIn 2018, GameSpot ranked Wolverine 14th in their \"50 Most Important Superheroes\" list.[217]\n\nIn 2018, ComicBook.com ranked Wolverine 13th in their \"50 Most Important Superheroes Ever\" list.[218]\n\nIn 2020, CBR.com ranked Wolverine 1st in their \"25 Best Anti-Heroes In Marvel Comics list.[219]\n\nIn 2021, Screen Rant included Wolverine in their \"10 Strongest X-Men\" list.[220]\n\nIn 2022, CBR.com ranked Wolverine 6th in their \"10 Scariest Avengers\" list[221] and 8th in their \"10 Greatest X-Men, Ranked By Experience\" list.[222]\n\nIn 2022, Screen Rant included Wolverine in their \"10 X-Men Characters, Ranked By Likability\" list.[223]\n\nOther versions\n\n[edit]\n\nAge of Apocalypse\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Age of Apocalypse\n\nIn the Age of Apocalypse story arc, the Wolverine/Logan character is again a member of the X-Men, this time using the code-name Weapon X rather than Wolverine.[224] In this reality the events which saw the character's Adamantium ripped out have never occurred, and it is Magneto that helps him to control his feral rages. Most significantly, Weapon X is missing a hand, cut off by Cyclops (who in turn is missing an eye thanks to Weapon X). The claws on this hand still exist, however, which appear by piercing through the metal stump covering the break. Consistent with the main characterization, this version is also shown to be a loner, his back story presenting him as an unwilling recruit to the X-Men. He and Jean Grey are lovers in this reality.[225] Also during the arc, there is a separate character named Wolverine, a mutant altered by Dark Beast, who worked as a tracker for Apocalypse.[226]\n\nWeapon Omega\n\n[edit]\n\nLater he offered himself to the Celestials to prevent the planet's judgment and was further augmented by the Celestial technology, yet while he had ascended in form and power, his mind had become so twisted to the point of assembling a deadly group of genetically modified warriors known as the Black Legion and sent them to kill Charles Lehnsherr, the infant son of Magneto and Rogue. He also captured his teammate Storm and renamed her as Orordius after using the Celestial technology on her, enslaving and transforming her into a blind seer made of living stone. He also intended to do the same to Jean Grey, by turning her into the Horseman of Death, but his efforts were prevented by the Uncanny X-Force from the Main Reality, who had traveled to the Age of Apocalypse seeking a celestial life seed.[227]\n\nAge of X\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Age of X reality, Wolverine's powers have been virtually lost after he was forced to ingest a mutant 'cure' to dispose of it; although his healing factor can stop the cure totally affecting him, it is now so focused on fighting the cure and the adamantium poisoning of his metal skeleton that he cannot fight anymore, as any additional strain placed on his system could kill him.[228]\n\nAmalgam Comics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Amalgam Comics community, Wolverine was combined with Batman to create Dark Claw.[229][230]\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows timeline, Wolverine is married to Jean Grey and they are the co-directors of education at Xavier's school for Gifted Youngsters. They also have a daughter named Kate, who is nicknamed \"Shine.\"[231] In this timeline, the superhero Civil War was averted when Charles Xavier proposed self-policing among the super-powered community.

They are confronted by a group of Sentinels and Wolverine lunges at one, ready to slice off the Sentinel's head, but his flesh is burned off by the Sentinel's hand laser. Wolverine seemingly dies and his charred Adamantium skeleton falls onto the ground. Later on in the Earth X: Heralds storyline, Wolverine is revived by X-51's machine.[233]\n\nDeadpool: Merc with a Mouth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the seventh issue of this series, Deadpool visits a universe where the wild west still exists. There Wolverine is a bounty hunter looking to make some money by capturing the Deadpool Kid.[234]\n\nEarth-9712\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the \"Devil's Reign\" storyline, Doctor Octopus formed his Superior Four with a variation of Wolverine who has tentacles with immensely sharp blades on his back.[235] His real name was Otto Howlett and he was experimented on by a variation of Torbert Octavius.[236]\n\nEarth X\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the information in the Earth X miniseries Paradise X: Heralds, the second child of the Howletts died in childbirth and the Howletts found and adopted an infant member of the Moon Clan, a bestial race which has co-existed with humanity for hundreds of thousands of years. This Clan, which is also dubbed wolf clan, were mortal enemies of the Bear Clan, to which Sabretooth belongs. Supposedly, it is this Moon Tribe child who was named James Howlett and would grow up to become Wolverine explaining the enmity between Wolverine and Sabretooth in this alternative reality.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIt is also revealed that this seemingly divergent sub-species is in fact what the \"true\" human species would have become if not for the Celestials' intervention and genetic tampering.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn the Earth X series, Wolverine has married Jean Grey; however, they are now overweight and fit the image of a bickering couple. When the Skull attacks New York, Wolverine refuses to aid Captain America and the other heroes in fighting him. Jean, disgusted, leaves Logan, but not before claiming that she is in fact Madelyne Pryor. The two later reconcile, but have not gotten back together.[volume & issue needed]\n\nExiles and Weapon X\n\n[edit]\n\nAnother version of Wolverine, originating from Earth-172, was revealed by Sabretooth to have joined an alternative, more sinister version of Weapon X in the Exiles series. At some point in Weapon X's travels, this version of Wolverine was killed. Like other fallen members of the Exiles and Weapon X, his body was stored in a stasis wall inside the Timebreakers' crystal palace before he was sent home to his own timeline to be cremated by his loved ones.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIssue #85 and #86 followed the adventures of several Wolverines from different timelines gathered in an attempt to stop a mutant known as Brother Mutant, a being with the combined powers of Wolverine, Magneto, Quicksilver, Scarlet Warlock (a male version of the Scarlet Witch) and Mesmero.

The last team of Wolverines was composed of Patch, an alternative version of the zombie Wolverine featured in the miniseries Marvel Zombies, Albert & Elsie-Dee, Weapon X, a young James Howlett and the Days of Future Past Logan. When most of this team fell before Brother Mutant's followers, Logan and James Howlett were able to contact the Timebreakers and convinced them to gather the original Exiles to help defeat Brother Mutant.[volume & issue needed]\n\nNumerous other alternative reality versions of Wolverine appear in those issues as well, some of them being hybrids between Wolverine and main Marvel continuity characters (Thing/Wolverine, Hulk/Wolverine, Deadpool/Wolverine, etc.).[volume & issue needed]\n\nIssue #91-94 shows Wolverine as an agent of HYDRA which he leads together with the Invisible Woman, with whom Logan has a relationship.

Rick was later killed when his attempt to defend himself from the Maestro with Captain America's shield caused him to be thrown out of his wheelchair and impaled on the skeleton's claws, the Maestro grimly commenting on the amusing irony of Rick being killed by one relic while defending himself with another.[237]\n\nGeneral James Howlett\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the \"Exalted\" storyline of Astonishing X-Men and X-Treme X-Men vol. 2, General Howlett was a general in the army of the British Empire, and viceroy of his world's Canada. Howlett was part of an expedition to the lost city of Shangri-La. There, his skeleton was bonded with the adamantine. However, he was taken from his world by some means when the Saviour came calling. He was held for a time, but escaped with the help of Scott Summers. Now he is a member of a dimension-hopping X-Men team and assisted with hunting down ten evil Xaviers from various alternative timelines to save the multiverse. He is in a relationship with his world's Hercules; however, their relationship is considered illicit because the gods of Olympus are not permitted to consort with mortals.[volume & issue needed]\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the alternative future of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wolverine's adamantium skeleton is reanimated and controlled by the brain of Doctor Doom. Additionally, one of the villains appearing in the series, in which Wolverine is still remembered with awe as \"the Brood Slayer\", is his great-great-granddaughter Rancor, who is obsessed with her ancestor and owns one of his broken off claws. Rancor comes to rule a human colony, which had been founded by Wolverine and other mutants, hundreds of years ago. She came from a long lineage, all claiming rulership by relation to Wolverine. Most were murderous tyrants.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIt is, however, hinted at that Wolverine is still alive. Alluded to by several \"shots\" of an unrevealed, shadowy individual, which included captions and character comments heightening the suggestion. The character is never revealed, leaving the question of who they were unanswered.[volume & issue needed]\n\nWhile it is a strongly held belief that he will live hundreds of years, this suggests Logan has the potential to live for thousands of years, but how it may fit into Marvel canon is unknown.[volume & issue needed]\n\nHere Comes Tomorrow\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the \"Here Comes Tomorrow\" story arc, set 150 years in an alternative future, Wolverine is still alive and part of group fighting against a version of Beast possessed by Sublime. This version of Wolverine is killed when Beast artificially gives himself the powers of the Phoenix Force and turns off Wolverine's healing factor, before beating him to death. This future is averted by Jean Grey.[238]\n\nThe Hooded Man\n\n[edit]\n\nThis version of Wolverine comes from hundreds of years into the future. He is part of a group called \"The Last Defenders\", who, led by a future version of Sue Storm, have come back in time to save the last of humanity.[239] This future Logan later briefly encounters his younger self at the future Sue's funeral, telling him, \"Don't even ask.\"[240]\n\nDuring the Fantastic Force mini-series, Logan briefly leads the team when they find themselves under attack from various enemies summoned by Gaea the living spirit of the Fantastic Force's now barren earth.

The two are last seen tending to a garden with Gaea pregnant.[241]\n\nHound\n\n[edit]\n\nA Wolverine from an unidentified reality is called Hound and is shown to be the loyal pet of the unidentified Dark Phoenix and member of her Berserkers. This version is shown to also have spikes coming out of him. They appeared as members of the Multiversal Masters of Evil. When the group was on Earth-616, Hound accompanied Dark Phoenix and King Killmonger in attacking Echo, Iron Man, and Thor at Asgard even when Dark Phoenix summoned a Berserker that is a Thor from an unidentified reality.[242] They retreated after the Berserker Thor was killed by Thor. The Multiversal Masters of Evil then left Earth-616 to get back to work.[243]\n\nHound was with the Multiversal Masters of Evil when they attacked an unidentified Earth. Afterwards, Ghost Rider attacked them where he used his Hell Charger to knock down Hound and Kid Thanos.[244]\n\nHound accompanied the Multiversal Masters of Evil when they returned to Earth-616.[245] After she knocked down some of the Avengers and Prehistoric Avengers, Hound was sent to take out any who are still squirming.

Wolverine has incredible strength. He has white hair (it is later changed to black in the new mangaverse) and a strange tattoo on his face, possibly meant to be the Greek symbol Omega.[citation needed] His uniform is highly reminiscent of that worn by Dragon Ball character Vegeta, possibly as homage.[citation needed]\n\nIn this reality, he and Cyclops are brothers. Wolverine cost Cyclops one of his eyes, while it is hinted that Cyclops cost Wolverine one of his hands. (This seems to be why one of Wolverine's sets of claws is energy while the other is metal. Throughout this story with the exception of a pair of panels, Wolverine was depicted with two flesh and blood hands, but his right hand had claws of energy, not adamantium. The flesh and blood appearance of both hands continued in the final issue of the first arc of Mangaverse). He is also hinted to have had a relationship with Jean Grey, who had begun to favor Cyclops.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn the New Mangaverse, Wolverine is one of the few mutants to survive the Hand/S.H.I.E.L.D. bio-engineered virus targeting mutants thanks to his healing factor. Jean Grey's rejection of him has clearly left him with some issues since he said he had a thing for redheads and flirts with Spider-woman (Mary Jane Watson) in New Mangaverse #2. It is clear that his advances are unwanted and that Mary Jane is scared of him. When Logan grabs her, Spider-Man becomes angry and tries to fight him but proves to be no match for Wolverine and it is ultimately the Black Cat that stops him. He flirts with the Black Cat throughout the New Mangaverse miniseries, saying \"I've always been a sucker for a girl with a nice set of ... CLAWS.\" It is also hinted that at some point in the past he was Lady Deathstrike's lover.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn the New Mangaverse, Wolverine teams up with the Black Cat, Captain America (Carol Danvers), Iron Man, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson), and The Torch (Jonatha Storm, Sioux Storm's half sister, this reality's Human Torch) to fight the Hand (some of the organization's more prominent members being Lady Deathstrike, Elektra, Silver Samurai, Sunfire, and a (brainwashed) Sharon Carter).[volume & issue needed]\n\nMarvel Noir\n\n[edit]\n\nIn X-Men Noir, set in the Marvel Noir reality, \"Captain\" Logan is a heavily scarred bootlegger operating in Chinatown with his first mate Eugene.

He is presented as a Catholic private investigator along with Dog Logan, whom he claims is his brother. As a victim of parental abuse, Jim is an expert knife fighter and suffers from blackouts due to rage. They are hired by Mariko Yashida to advance the Yashida activates in the city and encounter a man named Creed. Both Mariko and Dog were killed by Logan's former friend Rose who was impaled by him for revenge using two katana knives.[249]\n\nMarvel Zombies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the alternative Marvel Zombies universe, Wolverine is one of many heroes who become infected by the zombie virus. He is actually infected when both zombies Captain America, and Hawkeye bite him. The virus overwhelms his healing factor, so he can no longer heal from any injury. He, along with other zombies, attempted to slay the Silver Surfer. Wolverine attacks the Surfer but his body is decayed so much that his right arm is torn apart, as his adamantium bones are stronger than his rotting flesh. Eventually Wolverine and the other zombies are successful in killing and eating the Surfer. As a result, he and the others gain the Silver Surfer's cosmic power and wound and devour Galactus, becoming the creatures collectively known as The Galacti.[volume & issue needed]\n\nThe Marvel Zombies attack a Skrull planet, only to encounter the Fantastic Four of the 616 reality - currently consisting of Black Panther, Storm, the Thing and the Human Torch, leaving the Zombies eager to capture the FF and transport back to their reality.[250]\n\nIn Marvel Zombies 2, Wolverine's lost right arm has been replaced with a cybernetic arm with claws. He is loyal to Henry Pym (Giant-Man) and willingly attacks the defecting Spider-Man. When the others realize that the hunger is fading, he initially refuses to let go of a survivor in his grasp until Henry Pym tells him to stop, saying he seemingly loses his hunger.[volume & issue needed] He is one of the last surviving zombies from the zombie Hulk's attack that killed many zombies, and even the last zombies to especially kill the Hulk with his cosmic powers.[volume & issue needed]\n\nAfter that, he was teleported to a new world known as Earth 91126 along with the other surviving zombies. During the teleportation, he lost his cosmic powers, and became a regular zombie once more.[volume & issue needed]\n\nZombie Wolverine also appears in Marvel Zombies Return. In this Zombie Wolverine kills the human Elektra, Iron Fist (comics) and Shang-Chi, White Tiger, Black Tiger, and many of the Hand, thus recently he was one of the few remaining zombies left.[volume & issue needed]\n\nHe also appears in Japan, and infects another version of himself, though he resists the hunger and angrily kills him, zombie Spider-Man watches the whole thing happen.

He, along with the rest of the zombies are destroyed by the nanite-carried Sandman.[volume & issue needed]\n\nMC2\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the alternative future known as MC2, Wolverine and Elektra are married and have a daughter named Rina Logan, who inherits her father's healing factor and senses and possesses \"psychic claws\" which resemble Psylocke's telepathic \"psychic knife\". She becomes a superheroine called Wild Thing. Wolverine also has a son, Sabreclaw (Hudson Logan), with another woman.[volume & issue needed]\n\nDuring the events of Last Hero Standing, Wolverine is among the heroes kidnapped by Loki as part of his plan to bring about the end of the Age of Heroes.[volume & issue needed]\n\nMutant X\n\n[edit]\n\nin Mutant X a version of Wolverine is a member of \"the Pack\" a group consisting of Sabertooth, Wildchild and Logan. All three, savage and driven insane by the Weapon X experiments, roam the Canadian wilderness very much like a wolf pack.[volume & issue needed]\n\nOld Man Logan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Old Man Logan\n\nOld Man Logan is a character depicted in an eight-issue story arc in the Wolverine ongoing series by writer Mark Millar and artist Steve McNiven. He debuted in Wolverine #66 in June 2008. Set over fifty years in the future on Earth-807128, the entire United States has been overtaken and divided amongst supervillains. Logan lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in Sacramento, California, now part of the territory known as \"Hulkland.\" Logan needs money to pay rent to the landlords of this territory: the hillbilly grandchildren of the Hulk, who are products of years of incestuous procreation originating with Banner and his first cousin She-Hulk. To pay the rent, Logan accepts a job from a now-blind Hawkeye: help him navigate east across the country, to the capitol of New Babylon, and deliver a secret and illegal package.[volume & issue needed]\n\nThroughout the story it is said that Logan as \"Wolverine\" died the day the villains attacked and has refused to pop his claws since, even in a fight. Via flashbacks it is revealed that on the night the world's heroes came under attack by masses of villains, a group consisting of Mr. Sinister, Sabretooth, Doctor Octopus, Omega Red, Bullseye and many others attacked the X-Mansion. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine was forced to slaughter the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last attacker was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by Mysterio, and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow X-Men.[251] This destroyed him emotionally and mentally, and he wandered from the Mansion never to be heard from again, his last action laying his head across train tracks to be run over. Logan notes that while this would never have killed him, it in effect killed \"Wolverine\" for good.[volume & issue needed]\n\nThe story was concluded in Giant Size Old Man Logan (September 2009) with Logan riding off into the sunset, heavily implying that this alternative version of Wolverine is the same character as \"The Hooded Man\" version, described above.[volume & issue needed]\n\nAfter the events of the \"Death of Wolverine\" story arc, an Old Man Logan from Earth-20923 was brought to serve as a member of the Earth-616 X-Men.\n\nOld Man Phoenix\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Earth-14412 set during the reign of King Thor, an alternate version of Old Man Logan became possessed by the Phoenix Force and took on the alias of Old Man Phoenix. While he was bitter towards King Thor for disrupting the natural order of things, they are both confronted by Doctor Doom who is further empowered by the Starbrand, the \"iron fist\" move, as he plans to conquer Earth. Old Man Phoenix sacrifices himself so that King Thor can defeat Doctor Doom.[252]\n\nWhen the Council of Red attack Avengers Tower in the God Quarry, Old Man Phoenix is shown to be alive as he and the granddaughters of King Thor arrive and save Ant-Man, Moon Knight, and Vision from the Council of Red members who were burrowing towards the First Firmament. He then states to the remaining Council of Red members underground that he and his friends would like a word with them.[253]\n\nIn a flashback, Earth-14412's Mystique took on the powers of the Phoenix Force and used its powers to blast apart Old Man Phoenix. It took the granddaughters of King Thor awhile to gather his pieces like his head from their Earth's Mangog. Back in the present, Old Man Phoenix and the granddaughters of King Thor attack the Council of Red as Ant-Man informs everyone to prepare for the attacks on the Council of Red done by Old Man Phoenix and the granddaughters of King Thor. Their attacks cause the surviving Council of Red members to retreat. Afterwards, Old Man Phoenix explains to the granddaughters of King Thor about the God Quarry and its purpose. When Doom Supreme arrives at the God Quarry with Doom the Living Planet and other Doctor Doom variants loyal to him, Old Man Phoenix and Star Panther go on the attack as Doom Supreme forms a forcefield so that he can chant a spell.[254] Old Man Phoenix continues his fight with Doom Supreme with help from Echo and her Phoenix abilities. After Star Panther flies through Doom the Living Planet, Old Man Phoenix and Echo use their Phoenix abilities to make Doom the Living Planet bleed molten blood.[255] As Old Man Phoenix fights the remaining Doctor Doom variants, he runs into Dark Phoenix again. Before Dark Phoenix can attack Old Man Phoenix, she is struck down the Prehistoric Phoenix Firehair. When Mephisto takes in a sample of an ancient Multiverse's powers, Old Man Logan recognizes its power.[256] As Old Man Phoenix uses his powers to hold back the remnants of the ancient Multiverse, he advises everyone to think of something fast to deal with it as he can't hold it back for long. As Star Brand talks with Fireheart, Old Man Phoenix and Echo witnesses Fireheart taking Star Brand with her to an unknown location. Once back on Earth-14412, Old Man Phoenix watches the Granddaughters of Thor with their Mjolnir as he is planting some flowers.[257]\n\nPredator vs. Wolverine\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2023 Predator vs. Wolverine miniseries, set in its own continuity, one Yautja hunter, seeking the greatest prey in existence, elects to hunt the man who would become the Wolverine, from his early days in the blood-ridden Canadian wilderness to modern-day Madripor. On finally defeating the Yautja and taking its weaponry for himself, Wolverine finds among the Yakutia's possessions a spear made from the tail of a xenomorph.[258]\n\nPrelude to Deadpool Corps\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the second issue, a universe is shown where Wolverine is an orphaned child at Professor X's orphanage for troubled kids. At a dance for the orphanage, along with Emma Frost's, Wolverine, aided by child versions of Angel and Colossus, gets into a fight with Kidpool (a child version of Deadpool for whom Wolverine expresses hatred).[259]\n\nIn the third issue, Deadpool visits an earth where he is a dog and Wolverine is a dog created by Mascara X to hunt and kill Dog Deadpool, the first dog they experimented on. This universe's Wolverine has claws. After the battle he is shot into a pool of acid, his fate is unknown.[260]\n\nRuins\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Ruins, spending his time in a bar, this version of Wolverine threatened his fellow patrons to get more to drink, but more often than not was given free drinks by the bartender for showing off his \"bone disease\", bones that stuck out of the back of his hand. The bartender referred to him as \"Canuck.\"[261]\n\nSpider-Gwen\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Spider-Gwen reality, Manji Logan (a parody/composite version of Manji from Blade of the Immortal) was a Japanese samurai that was cursed by a witch to continue walking the Earth for as many lives as he has killed. Like his 616 counterpart, his memory is erased after joining the Weapon X program and gaining adamantium claws. He then decides to work for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Black Ops department, where his fellow operatives have nicknamed him \"Mr. Murderhands.\" Spider-Gwen nicknames him Wolverine after body swapping with the Earth 616 X-23 (who had the Wolverine identity at the time). He works closely with Shadowcat, as Kitty feels guilty for using her powers to aid the Weapon X Program.[262]\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited\n\n[edit]\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited (a comic based on the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series) introduces a bestial version of Wolverine in #6. In this continuity, Wolverine is Naoko Yamada-Jones's ex-husband and Shayne's father. Peter first finds a photo of them together, which shows that Wolverine was a decorated soldier. He later runs into Wolverine as Spider-Man and the 2 of them fight, but then stop to talk as they notice a robber kidnapping Naoko. They both follow the robber and manage to easily find him, due to Wolverine's sense of smell. The 2 of them team up to fight the robber, who transforms into a lizard and is revealed to be Chameleon of Counter-Earth. After they defeat him, Wolverine then says that this neighborhood is not his home anymore and gives Spider-Man his medal, which resembles the medal that Naoko's husband wears in the photo, confirming that Wolverine is Shayne's father and Naoko's ex-husband, despite the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series confirming that the Green Goblin of Counter-Earth is Naoko's ex-husband and Shayne's father, leaving the identity of Naoko's ex-husband and Shayne's father unknown.[volume & issue needed]\n\nUltimate Marvel\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Ultimate Wolverine\n\nUltimate Wolverine is the Wolverine in the Ultimate Marvel universe.
