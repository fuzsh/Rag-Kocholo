        "text": "It's been a while since I've done one of these on this Marvel animation forum, but with Carnage set to make his big screen debut in the upcoming Venom: Let There Be Carnage movie, I thought now would be a perfect time to look over some of his animated appearances. Enjoy!\n\n___\n\nThe 1990s has often been described as a difficult time for comic books. With the market booming in the early part of the decade before famously falling out of the bottom towards the middle/end of the decade before Marvel’s merger with Toy Biz, it’s a fascinating time to look back upon. As a Spider-Man fan who was in and out of comics at the time, I am often told of how terrible the creative teams were in the 1990s when plot thin crossovers, shiny variant covers and belts with endless pouches too small to fit anything were all the rage. Looking back, it would appear one of the main reasons The Amazing Spider-Man went downhill so fast was due to the absence of stalwart writer David Micheline.\n\nWhile his run is not often whispered in the same breath as some of the all time greats, I believe it should be. True, he was upstaged by the terrific artistic trio who served on the book with him, mainly Todd McFarlane, Erik Larson and Mark Bagley, but he seemed to be the first writer who knew what to do with the married Peter and Mary Jane, brought back the Sinister Six for what is still their best story and of course, created Venom and Carnage, the two most popular villains of the 90s.\n\nIn the introduction to the Carnage trade paperback collecting his debut storyline, Micheline confessed he originally planned to kill Venom/Eddie Brock off and have the symbiote bond with other existing characters around #400. What he did not expect, was the massive surge in sales and popularity for Venom, meaning there was utterly no way Marvel would allow him to kill the Lethal Protector off. In lieu of the symbiote obtaining new ‘hosts’, he decided that an entire new character would be better suited and Cletus Kassidy was created. With fans enjoying the undeniably/nonsensical crazy sense of justice Eddie Brock had, Micheline went the entirely opposite direction with Cassidy and created a serial killer who had no intention of saving any innocents.\n\nDebuting in The Amazing Spider-Man #344, fans were teased with his appearance as the symbiote broke Eddie Brock out of prison and left a small fragment of itself behind before finally debuting in #361 as Carnage. The three part story sees Spider-Man utterly outmatched by his new foe and returning the to Island on which he exiled Venom following their previous battle, in which Brock actually thought he’d defeated and killed Spider-Man… which I thought was trifle too convenient, as if Venom ever returned to anywhere with a TV/Newspaper, he would see that Peter Parker/Spider-Man was alive and well, but in the smaller scheme of things, a Predator inspired battle between Spider-Man and Venom was a great read, and Erik Larson drew an incredible Venom. It is easy to see why Venom was so popular in his original handful of appearances. (In fairness I haven’t read the storyline in so long, there may be a reason why indeed Brock decided to stay on the island, but if there was, I cannot remember what it.)\n\nWith the introduction of Carnage and Spidey being undoubtedly outmatched by his new foe, Spidey sought an alliance with an enemy he once thought to be his most dangerous certainly made for interesting drama, I read this collected story as young lad and thoroughly enjoyed it. While it seems stupid to think of it now, in those days, stories only got collected in trade paperbacks if they were a big deal and make no mistake, Carnage was a big deal for Marvel. It also meant that Carnage was one of the few villains at the time, I knew a great deal about before I saw their animated debuts. I had also played the hell out of the excellent Maximum Carnage video game for the Sega Mega Drive.\n\nSadly, his success became his downfall as most of his further appearances only seemed to dilute his character rather than add to it… shortly after this the Maximum Carnage comic book storyline was produced, which seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to have Venom and Carnage appear across all four Spider-Man books for a 3 month period in hopes of huge sales. It was later turned into an aforementioned video for the Mega Drive/Super Nintendo but as far as story goes, it was paper thin. Sadly Micheline left The Amazing Spider-Man and was replaced by J M Demattias, who sadly, wrote mostly drivel disguised as a deep philosophical take on Spider-Man in which he decided that Peter Parker was the problem and he was abandoning his humanity as Peter Parker to become The Spider… then we got to Traveller, the return of The Jackal and the Clone Saga mess and it was clear the marketing department was writing as much as the writer and it would be years before The Amazing Spider-Man would be worth reading again… Chapter One, Tom Defalco, Howard Mackie… it wasn’t until JMS came along that Marvel’s flagship title was actually good (and editorial certainly endhttp://marvel.popgeeks.com/spideytased his run on the sourest of notes). Personally, Micheline, or a writer of his ilk, was missed for what felt like a good decade.\n\nGetting back to Carnage however… in the 90s he was arguably the most popular supervillain going. Which meant it was no surprise that when a new Spider-Man animated series was greenlighted, Carnage had to appear. What was a surprise however, was that he did not appear until the middle of season three. To give context, he was featured in the very first wave of action figures so fans knew he was coming long before he actually showed up. I personally had the Carnage figure for years before he appeared in the show, but there was no Hobgoblin drama of getting him in the show early, the figure seemed to sell well based solely on his comic book popularity. With the introduction of Venom in The Alien Costume being one of the shows very best stories, anticipation was high for Carnage.\n\nSadly, by the time season three debuted, the shows quality had dropped. The editing had become something of an embarrassment, the animation had dropped to often cringe worthy levels and the pacing of each episode was often too frantic… which was especially annoying when the show had as many flashbacks as Spider-Man did… it was clear they were trying to save the animation budget by reusing as much old animation as possible, but the ‘tricks’ used to do this weren’t at all clever, especially as the Spider-Man model seemed to tweak every episode. While the show was normally well written, there was usually a lot going on in every episode, compared to the better paced, much better animated stories in the opening season. These two episodes alone feature Venom returning, the introduction of Cletus Kassidy, him becoming Carnage, a team up with War Machine and later Iron Man, more Madame Web lessons, a romance between Eddie and Dr Kafka as well as Dormammu and Baron Mordo, who despite being perfectly entertaining villains, really were not needed in this story… or in any Spider-Man story, unless Doctor Strange is featured. That’s a lot to do in 44 minutes!\n\nIt must also be said that Carnage is clearly neutered from his comic book character here. Those of you expecting a serial killer clearly were not going to get one from Spider-Man: The Animated Series, as violence of pretty much any kind was strictly prohibited. Broadcast Standards and Practices would’ve promptly crapped their pants if the show had tried to fully adapt Carnage from the comic books here. The reigns never let up on Spider-Man: The Animated Series, the show faced problems in every single episode because of the backlash from the violence shown in Batman: The Animated Series and Mighty Morpin’ Power Rangers. Having interviewed many of the writers and in a cool gift, actually been provided some of the BS+P notes from this very story, it’s surprising that the show ever made it to air. They were that strict with the censorship in this show.\n\nThe story sees Spider-Man capture Kassidy, who had attempted to blow up the orphanage he grew up in. He is sent to Ravencroft and is institutionalised next to Eddie Brock, who was arrested following The Alien Costume Part 3, and presumably also institutionalised by telling everyone he was bonded to an alien, while having obvious anger issues towards Spider-Man and being found trespassing unconscious in a Space Shuttle Exhibition, without his shirt no less. With the symbiote still stranded in space, Dormammu instructs Baron Mordo to retrieve it as it returns to Earth and hypnotises its new hosts into reuniting the symbiote with Brock, so he can retrieve Tony Stark’s new Interdimensional Transporter, which Dormammu plans to use to free himself from the dark dimension he is trapped in. Oddly, instead of instructing Mordo to help Venom defeat Spider-Man and War Machine with his own not unformidable mystical powers, Dormammu explains the symbiote was about to reproduce, giving us the Carnage symbiote, which he then offers to Cassidy in exchange for his servitude.\n\nI have to admit, it was incredibly cool to see Kassidy bond with the symbiote, and the model for this scene has the same kinetic skin from the comic books, offering some very nice visuals for a change. I think this Carnage model is actually one of the shows best, which I can only assume is because they knew Carnage needed to look his best here… I was pleased with what we got, especially in part two, when the animation and colour quality increased massively from part one, which looked fairly flat and pale in comparison.\n\nCarnage is voiced by Scott Cleverdon here, who I think does a fantastic job. He manages to sound full on looney tunes without overdoing it and appears to be having a great time while he’s at it. I can’t say I’ve ever heard of Cleverdon’s work on anything else other than this show sadly, but he was more than a credible Carnage here. Overall, I do think the show is well cast throughout with some actors sadly overlooked. Neil Ross, Roscoe Lee Brown and even Chris Barnes never quire get their due as to how utterly fantastic they were The Green Goblin, The Kingpin and Spider-Man himself.\n\nRather than kill people, Carnage sucks the ‘life force’ out of them as an equal amount of energy is needed to replace Dormammu’s in the dark dimension, and the visual of Carnage extracting the life out of his villains was actually pretty cool, but the weak side of the story is that after waiting to see Carnage for so long, he is essentially a puppet for Dormammu. He is actually killed off at the end of the episode (being trapped in another dimension instead of dying was a trick this show used Broadcast, Standards and Practises throwing a hissy fit). As someone who had only seen season one Iron Man at the time I first viewed this episode, it was also a bit odd seeing how quickly Iron Man suggested throwing Carnage into an unknown dark dimension. Another great bit sees him smash the Interdimensional Transporter to bits;\n\nSpider-Man: Hey! That belongs to Stark Industries!\n\nIron Man: If Tony Stark has a problem, he can take it up with me!\n\nAh, the good old days of Iron Man’s somewhat stupid secret identity. Bonus points for casting Robert Hayes as Iron Man again, he’s still my favourite Iron Man voice.\n\nVenom turns babyface (to utilize a professional wrestling term) and sacrifices himself to save Kafka. Madame Web warns Spider-Man he himself may have to make such a sacrifice one day. At this point, it was clear the Madame Web storyline was building to something big… I didn’t see it at the time, but Madame Web’s arc over the course of the show was to get Peter passed his own self doubt, which later brought us to the finale.\n\nHaving tested Spider-Man with the Secret Wars, Madame Web and her master, The Beyonder, had vexed their powers and were unable to stop an evil version of Spider-Man, bonded with the Carnage symbiote, to stop him blowing up all reality. Travelling back in time, our Spider-Man is tasked with leading a team of Spider-Man from different realms to stop Spider-Carnage in what is now known as the original Spider-Verse. Dan Slott denies this being an inspiration for the comic book storyline which later became an incredible animated movie, but the similarities are easy to locate.\n\nWhile Cletus Kassidy doesn’t appear, essentially an alternate reality version of Spider-Man is bonds with what may well be ‘our’ realities Carnage symbiote, driving him insane. While it did sting a little to see the Mary Jane cliffhanger unresolved, the episode offers an utterly fantastic character piece for Peter who is essentially overcoming his own demons and shortcomings, by saving Gwen Stacey, the one who he ultimately failed to save in the comics, and by bringing that dimensions Uncle Ben to remind Peter that he’s stronger the symbiote, the evil inside him and reminding him that with great power there must also come great responsibility. There’s no final fight here as Spider-Carnage admits his evil doings and essentially commits suicide. Semper understood his assignment here. It’s worth adding that Christopher Daniel Barnes made for an excellent villain here, if any casting directors are reading this, give his agent a call. He was a truly excellent Spider-Man.\n\nThe show ends with Spider-Man telling Stan Lee, his creator, that he is happy with the man he has become and he has literally overcome his own perceived shortcomings before Madame Web returns and explains that he’s saved all reality and his reward awaits him;\n\n“Face front true believer! We are going to find the real Mary Jane Watson! It has been a long, hard road and I think you are finally entitled to some happiness!”\n\nThe show was never renewed for further episodes because executive producer Avi Arad fell out with Fox Kids executive, the legendary Margaret Loesch. It was a decision I believe Fox would later regret, because even reruns of Spider-Man: The Animated Series were still doing very strong numbers for many years. Marvel attempted to replace the show with Spider-Man: Unlimited, which was an unmitigated disaster.\n\nCarnage was due to return in a hypothetical season six as he was transported back to Victorian Era England in which it would’ve been revealed that he was Jack The Red, better known as Jack The Ripper. Not sure how that one would’ve gotten past BS+P, but there was certainly a plan for more Carnage, had the show continued.\n\nA small tidbit which many of you may not know… mindless versions of Venom and Carnage were originally supposed to return in season four in an episode which featured Ghost Rider. When Fox learned UPN were potentially planning a Ghost Rider show (via a backdoor pilot in The Incredible Hulk) they ixnayed the entire episode.\n\nAs a youngster, I was very much impressed with Carnage in the show. I wasn’t expecting a murderous psychopath, and I think it would be foolish of anyone to assume that’s what we’d get, but I did think there was more fun to be had with this version of Carnage (season four in particular, was crying out for a big villain)\n\nIt was certainly better than what came next…\n\nNext: Planet of the Symbiotes\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited was the result of seemingly everything going wrong behind the scenes of a show. Following the foolish decision to cancel Spider-Man: The Animated Series, which was still pulling great ratings even in reruns, selling a mass amount of merchandise and was critically acclaimed in its day, Fox and Marvel negotiated an agreement to keep Spider-Man and X-Men on the air, in return for a new low budget Spider-Man show to be produced.\n\nWith Spider-Man: The Animated Series producer/story editor John Semper falling out with Avi Arad following numerous clashes of heads which essentially boiled down to one of them wanting to write a belter of a show and the other wanting a toy advert, he was not invited back as showrunner for this version of Spider-Man. Animation veteran Will Meugniot, who served as a producer on the first season of X-Men and Michael Reeves, a seasoned pro of many quality cartoons of the era including Batman: The Animated Series and Gargoyles were hired. The problem was, that Marvel was also negotiating with Sony for their live action Spider-Man series, and the ‘classic’ Spider-Man animation rights were part of the deal, which Sony intended to option (this would later become Spider-Man: The New Animated Series on MTV)\n\nThe original idea of doing a low budget, motion comic looking version of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko’s run was not now legally possible, and the crews back up idea of a counter Earth in which Uncle Ben did not die, and therefore Peter did not learn his lesson that with great power comes great responsibility and he essentially becomes that world’s version of Venom, which Marvel ixnayed. A Spider-Man 2099 proposal was quickly shot down as Marvel was still facing backlash for replacing Peter Parker as Spider-Man with Ben Reilly, until finally, Marvel provided them with a list of characters they wanted the show to feature… Venom and Carnage being the main ones, but the rest of the characters seemed to stem from The High Evolutionary’ s experiments. The High Evolutionary is not really a character that remotely fits within Spidey’s world, however, he creates animal/human hybirds, which, along with armours, is one of the things Toy Biz chief executive Avi Arad loves the most because the are proven action figure sellers, it was clear he planned the show, and the rest of the Marvel cartoon of the era, as a toy advert.\n\nThere’s no getting around it… the show never got passed it’s out there premises. It’s too far removed from Spider-Man to even feel remotely Spider-Manish, as even his classic costume was off limits. I don’t especially care for his new threads, nor his new voice. Rino Romano was cast as Spider-Man for this show, and to be blunt, he’s not very good. His quips fall flat and he oversells the dramatic stuff for me… he sounds very forced. It’s worth mentioning he didn’t have any good material to work with either. He would reprise his role in the excellent Spider-Man video game in 2000 and while it did take me a long time to get over the fact they didn’t bring Chris Barnes back, who would’ve been perfect for that game, he’s much better there than he is here.\n\nThe writing is not up to snuff and it doesn’t impress visually, sadly, the show is without much in terms of redeeming qualities. Spider-Man even has a cape... it's disrespectful.\n\nCarnage is one of the main villains of the show, as Venom and Carnage actually hijacked John Jameson’s ship to travel to Counter Earth as they wanted to be involved in the Synoptic… the problem was, no one ever before to explain what in the blue hell the Synoptic actually was… the two central villains motivations made no sense, whatsoever. It was also oddly out of place to see Venom and Carnage team up, as they are traditionally the worst of enemies.\n\nCarnage is also known for having one of the coolest designs for a villain ever. Mark Bagley designed a masterpiece for in his The Amazing Spider-Man run, arguably one of the greatest designs ever from the 90s best artist, which is utterly butchered here. Carnage is essentially a red skeleton with eyes and spikes, how, for some reason, can now turn entirely into liquid (think Inque from Batman Beyond, just not remotely cool looking). Sadly, the model is a bloody eye sore, but the contract forbade them from having Carnage look like Carnage… the show seemed utterly doomed before it even started airing.\n\nVenom and Carnage appeared plenty, but offered very little. The Synoptic event happened in episode 13, which meant the season ended on a cliffhanger as it looked as if the Counter Earth was about to be destroyed. A second season was commissioned and a number of scripts were written but never produced as Marvel began fighting bankruptcy issues… I do not consider this a loss.\n\nWhen the show premiered, it received terrible reviews and was utterly thumped by Pokemon in the ratings, to the point where the show was pulled from the scheduled after three episodes… it was an unmitigated failure from top to bottom and was quickly forgotten about as soon as the remaining episodes aired in 2000. Most involved with the show don’t seem to be happy with the result of it, but I don’t believe they are to blame… this was destined, destined for failure. When it was announced as being part of the Disney + catalogue, it wasn’t met with the same resounding cheers as Spider-Man and X-Men were. The show wasn’t even met with a line of action figures… even Arad must’ve known he had a complete dud on his hands, as he happily commissioned waves for The Avengers: United They Stand and Silver Surfer, two other Fox/Marvel failures. Spider-Man Unlimited is actually probably best remembered as a pale knock off of Batman Beyond, despite being in production before that show.\n\nChalk this one up as a failure folks… I honestly couldn't recommend this to even the most hardcore of Spider-Man fans. It's a soulless cash grab that did not work in any context.\n\nEntirely absent from Spider-Man: The New Animated Series and Sam Raimi’s live action movie trilogy, Carnage was intended to appear in the third season of The Spectacular Spider-Man following a brief cameo of Cletus Kassidy as a Ravencroft patient in season two. Supervising producer/story editor Greg Weisman has never elaborated as to what the plans for Carnage were, as he believes that telling the audience what happens online will ruin said plans if the show is ever commissioned for a further season/spin off/comic book. While a third season of Spectacular Spider-Man seems tragically unlikely, I respect his stance. For many, many years, I thought a third season of Young Justice wasn’t going to happen, but Weisman is now hard at work on season four.\n\nWith Marvel regaining the animation rights from Sony for Spider-Man and his associated characters as part of the option to extend the live action movie rights (a decision I imagine they now completely regret), essentially ending the slightest chance of a third season of Spectacular, Marvel began work on their own brand new Spider-Man show, which we would eventually come to know as Ultimate Spider-Man.\n\nMan of Action were announced as the show runners, which should’ve set my spider sense off, as the utterly fantastic Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes suffered a noticeable dip in quality once they came on board. Marketing for the show seemed to be based upon who was working on the show, rather than anything about the show itself, beyond a brief trailer being shown at Comic Con, which looked to have beautiful animation, but writing wise, was clearly targeted at the kiddies.\n\nI won’t bore you with the details of season one, but it was dreadful. Visually beautiful to look at with excellent models and animation, but the writing was mainly lousy, with most of the plots being stoopid with 2 o’s (thank you, Knives Out), the characters being one note and that note being really annoying and the humour was just lame. The first season was usually team up affairs, because the whole thing was deliberately designed to sell the various licensing products between Spider-Man and the Avengers… the show clearly never tried to hide it was a toy advert. It aimed for low fruit, because Loeb didn't seem to know how to create anything pleasing to anyone under 8 anymore.\n\nGetting to Carnage… season two promised the introduction of more villains, as the show was oddly mandated to use only the Raimi movie villains in season one. It was never explained why this was, but the rest of the villains were Avengers villains mainly, and there’s a reason why each respective hero has his own rogues, mainly being that Avengers villains never really meshed with Spidey. The unimaginative episode titles made it sound like they were supplying product rather than entertaining stories, and Carnage debuted in his self entitled episode, but it wasn’t the Cletus Kassidy version we all know and love/hate depending on which side of the fence you sit.\n\nThe symbiotes were completely overdone in season one and never really had any character to them, it just felt like any excuse to give a character powers… making Harry Venom felt like bad fan fiction at this point. To label a point, I recently considered updating the Venom retrospective, but when I concluded just how much more of Ultimate Spider-Man I'd have to rewatch again, I decided against it... it's really not good.\n\nI admit to looking forward to seeing Carnage appear, if for nothing else, he would surely have a nice character model, because I had given up on expecting a well written episode at this time in the show. Cletus Kassidy is nowhere to be found and instead The (not Green) Goblin returns, this time to bond the symbiote with Peter, believing him to be a worth son in lieu of Harry. The model was nice enough, but the Carnage aspect of the episode seemed to be over before it really went anywhere… Peter separated from the Carnage symbiote and then we were back to another Goblin/Spider-Man/Harry fight, which it felt had already been done too many times at this point, a lot of this show felt very repetitive… it didn’t help when so many of the episodes Peter learnt the same lessons over and over again. For a science prodigy, Man of Action treated Peter like a complete idiot for the sake of a few unfunny ‘comedy’ spots. Credit to whoever decided to expand upon the show’s rouges gallery in season two, the show already needed fresh blood on the villains side of things as Doc Ock, Venom and The Goblin were already showing signs of overuse, one season in.\n\nWe will now skip to season four, as Carnage didn’t appear in season three… not that this version had anything slightly to do with the season two version, but anyway.\n\nBy the time the forth season came along, the show had made many positive changes. Man Of Action had left and some of the previous ‘rules’ established, to the decrement of the show, had been lifted. Multiple episode stories were now allowed, the supporting cast of Cage/Iron First/White Tiger/Nova were gradually phased out and replaced with the more interesting Web Warriors (I imagine because Spider-Man variant toys sold better than the Ultimate friends) and thankfully, show became less stupid with its plots. It still had a lot of issues it could never get passed (Drake Bell being one of the main ones… the man was deeply irritating in the role and never got better) but the show was a lot more watchable, and it attempted to translate some of the bigger, more modern Spider-Man storylines of the time. I would assume this is because comics editor Steve Wacker took a strong presence in the show behind the scenes, and to be blunt, was better at his job than his predeccesor was.\n\nThe Symbiote Saga was one of these. A 3 part storyline which saw a new variant of the symbiote created by Michael Morbius, all three parts seem to be fairly drastically different from each other. Part one sees the symbiote attach itself to Doc Ock, which will remind old school Spider-Man fans of the 2000 Neversoft game and it’s final heart stopping level which players have to get the hell away from Monster Ock. The episode picks up after Ock is separated form the symbiote and we get a more traditional, excellent looking Mark Bagley esquire Carnage. Spidey and Venom (Flash now, Brock never appeared in the show) are now pitted against a fairly creepy Carnage who speaks very little but screams a lot. I want to say it’s Fred Tarascoire voicing him this time around as he did in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions but there is no credit.\n\nI thought part one was the best of the storyline, beyond the reveal that Spidey knew how to combat Carnage with two separate noise frequencies, as there was no way he would know this… it was simply an excellent guess.\n\nPart two takes us in a different direction with the Carnage bomb going off in the city, turning normal citizens, and in a fairly cool twist, The Hulk, into symbiotes. This episode is all but a love letter to the Maximum Carnage storyline of the 90s, which Captain America, Iron First, Shriek, Cloak and Dagger all play a part in. Harry awakens from his coma, as he is Anti-Venom now (still no Brock) and they manage to free the city if the symbiote’s grip. Sadly, the revelation when Harry finds out Peter is Spider-Man is fairly flat as he seems to gladfully accept it, despite Harry hating Spider-Man for the entire duration of the show.\n\nPart three again takes us on a different twist, as it turns out the Carnage symbiote was not defeated at all, and becomes a giant Staypuff Marshmellow Man sized villain before taking over Midtown High and takes a new host in Mary Jane, becoming the Carnage queen. The storyline seemed to be starting strong before it headed off here, and the previously established Hydra villains try and take over, including a new Man Bat style Michael Morbius. Peter, Harry and Flash reveal themselves to be Spider-Man, American Son and Venom to Mary Jane in an attempt to prove that they love her and she is more than just a symbiote host… at this point it was almost comical how everyone of Peter’s pals ended up with powers, it felt like supporting characters were of no use unless they had powers/a costume that a toy could me made from. It turned what started as an intriguing storyline into yet another episode about Peter’s pals getting powers… Mary Jane would later become Spider-Woman, which again felt like a step too far.\n\nI give credit where credit is due, Ultimate Spider-Man got a lot better as it went on. From, frankly, a terribly written but beautiful show in season one to something could be entertaining, but rarely excellent by the time it ended. It always seemed to struggle as a basic premises, one can conclude either the network or the executive producers really hammered down on the writers creativity here. I had hoped when the show finished and was almost immediately replaced with Marvel’s Spider-Man, the consistent problems found in the show could be eradicated and replaced to make a truly awesome Spider-Man show but alas, similar problems persisted, but as Carnage did not appear in Marvel’s Spider-Man, these will be addressed in a future retrospective for another character.\n\nThe legacy of Ultimate Spider-Man will probably not be a strong one. I believe it will be remembered in a similar vain as The Batman, a show made strictly for it's merchandising and demographic seeking overlords, rather than being remembered fondly by it's audience.\n\nCarnage, however, wasn't done in the Loeb era of Marvel Animation just yet however...\n\nNext: Welcome to the Guardian's of the frickin' Galaxy"
