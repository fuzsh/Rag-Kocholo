If you appreciate what I do, consider contributing to my Patreon at patreon.com/camseyeview. It would help support my work, and keep the website up. Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nConsidering we could very well see an animation strike any day now, you know I’ll be fully on board with the strike and the creatives in the industry telling the industry itself that the current working conditions are not okay, and that generative AI has no place in the workplace. Because the heads of studios are also willing to simply halt production and or cancel anything animated, it’s going to be a miracle that any show survived the recent mergers and are released. Yes, we sadly lost Clone High once again, and many other projects are either going to get dumped out or removed from existence because monstrous individuals like David Zaslav can’t buy a fifth mega yacht. Luckily, some other studios are willing to buy the rights to certain projects that have been put into limbo and give them a proper release. It’s going to be weird to see a show that was meant to be made for one studio end up on another service or channel because of poor decisions from the higher-ups, but again, the fact they get released in this current tumultuous time is a miracle, and thank goodness someone decided that Batman: Caped Crusader should be given a new life on Prime.\n\nSet in a world based on the Batman stories from the 1940s and 1960s, this new iteration, as many have mentioned, has our caped crime fighter putting away the utility belt and his fists of justice, and instead we follow a more detective/thriller based experience, as we see a batty individual in the earlier years of his crime-fighting days. The funny thing is, that if you are here to see Batman on screen at all times, then you will probably hate this show. While Batman does do what Batman does best with solving crimes and beating up mobsters and corrupt individuals, the masked hero himself is not in the show a whole lot. That sounds weird, right? Why would you want to watch a show where you don’t see our costumed hero on screen at least 60-70% of the runtime of each 30-or-so-minute episode? How do you make up for the fact that you see more of Bruce Wayne and the side characters and villains than the iconic hero himself?\n\nIt’s rather simple. You focus more on the already mentioned noir and thriller perspective of each story and build up the characters that revolve around those elements. It’s a more methodical journey as you see the twists and turns that follow our characters. Some characters get season-long arcs, while some, depending on how familiar you are with the characters, are going to have some fairly obvious fates. The way they mold and build up these characters results in some of these iterations of the characters being the most interesting versions. The way they build up characters like Harvey Dent and Harley Quinn is great, because they aren’t just repeating familiar story beats with them from previous incarnations. I know many folks love the preferred versions from stuff like the ’90s show versions of the two, but seeing Harley be her own character/villain outside of the Joker’s looming shadow was refreshing. Seeing Harvey have a more realistic disfigured look and more emphasis put on his mental issues paints him more of a tragic figure, and you don’t use the more stylized design seen in other incarnations of the villain. You even see more of the detectives this time around, and Bruce Wayne himself often shows up for maybe a third or less of the overall runtime of each episode. He’s there enough to make it a Batman show, but we also see him as a more novice Batman. The big problem that some previous versions ran into like Bruce Timm’s take on the character during Justice League/Unlimited and Brave and the Bold is that it focused on Batman being too heavily prepared and victorious for every situation. Sure, you can say that those versions worked for the shows for which they were made, but not every superhero is going to be so prepared that it makes each combat encounter trivial. In this show, we see a Batman that is more careful and not using a ton of fancy gadgets, as you mostly see him use smoke bombs and the grappling hook, but not much else. He has to be a bit scrappier in fights, but luckily this universe they are building right now feels more grounded. As much as I love Batman as a franchise, some incarnations focus a bit too much on the superpowers of other individuals, and as of this season, we see more grounded takes on villains like Clayface. All I’m going to say is they might have the same or similar backstories as other versions, but they aren’t going to be turning into monstrous creatures five times bigger than our hero. Even getting a new take on a familiar face like The Penguin, voiced by Minnie Driver was something I didn’t know this franchise needed until I saw it in the first episode. The only one who doesn’t get too much change in her backstory is Catwoman, but she is still a fun character to see in this version of the show with her visuals being more inspired by her older counterparts and less by her new ones. The fact that this show balanced out its villain roster for season one with both familiar faces and some lesser-known villains like Onomatopoeia showed that they were ready to not just rehash the same villain roster as previous shows did. Sure, you get a tease of the big bad himself at the end of the final episode, but the show was compelling enough to slowly introduce us to this version of the world and the experience of it all.\n\nAnimation-wise, it looks like a more polished version of Bruce Timm’s previous ventures into adapting and working on DC animated projects. It doesn’t have the repetitive body types that plagued his other work and it truly does look good from an art direction and design perspective. I wish they had done a little more to match the dramatic lighting of the 90s cartoon if they were going for a more noir angle with this take, but it still has that moody grimy feel that you get from the period in history in which this show takes place. It doesn’t have the flashiest action, but it’s not meant to be flashy. It makes you feel the weight of the punches and the movements. This more subdued color pallet also blends into the designs of the villains like Clayface and Two-Face. Now voicework-wise, they did do a good job, but with some hiccups along the way. We get some great performances from the likes of Minnie Driver as Penguin, Jason Watkins as Alfred, Diedrich Bader as Harvey Dent, Christina Ricci as Catwoman, and Jamie Chung as Harley Quinn, but of course, the sink-or-swim survival of this show was going to come down to Hamish Linklater as Batman. At first, I found him to sound too rough as both Batman and his alter ego, but he grew on me as the season went on, and he was able to balance out a more normal tone and the Batman tone. It didn’t sound great in the first episode, and it distracted me when the first few bits of Bruce Wayne were clunky, but Hamish is a good Batman. Another performance I like is Reid Scott as Onomatopoeia who only speaks in, well, onomatopoeias. A fairly imposing figure with the great design of his mask and his physical look that made for a threatening vibe. Other performances include Tom Kenny as Firebug, Toby Stephens as Gentleman Ghost, Dan Donohue as Clayface, and Krystal Joy Brown as Barbara Gordon. It’s a stacked cast, and it also brought back a sound that has been missing from a lot of DC animated shows and animation in general. Instead of just getting the biggest names for the sake of having the biggest names to voice these characters, they chose actors with distinct sounds to their voices like Michelle C. Bonilla as Renee Montoya. It’s something I have missed since the days of the Justice League/Unlimited run of shows, and also having actors like Jeff Bennett, Gary Anthony Williams, and John DiMaggio as side characters is always a plus. A surprise in the voice cast I had to double-check was Paul Sheer in episode one, and Haley Joel Osment in episode eight. Again, a great ensemble of talented actors for these specific roles.\n\nWhile it might stumble in some places due to being the newest version of the famous hero, Batman: Caped Crusader is a wonderful new take on the crime fighter. A more noir-focused thriller perspective adds a new flavor to the caped crusader’s ventures into the world of animation with fresh takes on Gotham’s villains. It’s available now to stream, and if you require some fresh Batman in your watchlist, then give this one a watch.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

The show with TIgra and Dazzler didn’t leave the production stage, MODOK only lasted one season, Howard the Duck also didn’t go anywhere, and Hit Monkey is now the only one from that deal to thrive and survive. I mean, when you have a bunch of corporate execs making the calls, you would also learn how to survive the chopping room floor. The first season was pretty solid with an interesting and compelling revenge thriller plot that set us up with a season two. Not without its faults, but Hit Monkey is one of the more entertaining takes on the Marvel series with its contemplative journey of discovery, revenge, and its hyper-violence brought to life by the same studio that did the Archer series, Floyd County Productions. Things went silent for a bit, but I was happy to see we finally got a season two to see where this journey takes our simian hitman and his ghostly sidekick. Could they overcome the season two slump or was Hit Monkey able to make his target? Here are my thoughts.\n\nWith season two, we follow Hit Monkey, voiced by Fred Tatasciore, and his ghostly companion Bryce, voiced by Jason Sudeikis. As they try to carve out a name for themselves as ‘hitmen for hire’ in New York, they get the help they need by connecting with a woman named Eunice, voiced by Leslie Jones. She helps the two find work, and that just results in a lot of nonsense. They find out that a cabal of secret organization members want to use special weapons/artifacts to rule the rule. Hit Monkey teams up with a new team of ex-mercenaries to get those ancient artifacts out of their hands, our duo run into Akiko Yokohama again from Japan, voiced by Olivia Munn, they get caught up by being hunted down by Lady Bullseye, voiced by Reiko Aylesworth, and on top of all that, you find out why Bryce is back in the human world, and what he had to do to get back there.\n\nWith season one, we go through a journey where Hit Monkey learns about the way violence and anger fuel us as he goes on a killing spree to get back at the folks that killed his tribe, and Bryce goes on a path to redemption for his actions past and present. We see how even though the action was pretty stellar, if a bit messy at points, their decision-making had consequences as they traversed the path to take care of the corruption that was infesting Japan’s politics. Now, we follow our duo as the big theme of season two is forgiveness and connection. Monkey is tired of the constant violence of their work, Bryce tries to find a way to reconnect with his daughter that he hasn’t seen in 20 or so years, and they both take the help from some folks with questionable morals to get what they need. Monkey wants to feel like he belongs somewhere and to make a more peaceful life for himself and the world in which he lives, and Bryce makes a literal deal with the devil to get what he wants. It also continues the commentary on how violence and anger corrupt us as, instead of following Monkey’s path of violence, we follow what happens with Lady Bullseye. Or, well, the new Lady Bullseye who is using her new goal in life to take down Monkey for killing her uncle. Even the group that helps Monkey save the world and rid it of hate and violence galore almost comes off like they are also finding redemption for their previous lives as assassins. It’s a great core concept for this season, as there are plenty of stories from TV and shows about hired killers wanting to find a way to escape their blood-filled lives. It was one of the best elements of the film, The Execution Game. In that film, we followed our assassin who was tasked with taking out another hitman who was considered as good or even better than him. Instead of being a constant tug of war via a shootout between our leads, what drives that film’s plot is more about the lead, in that life where he has to constantly look over his shoulder, while his target is trying to leave that life due to not wanting to have to worry when his next day may be his last. You can see elements of that kind of story in Hit Monkey season two, as it’s wrapped around the main goal of stopping this group who has a multitude of mystical weapons that drive the wielders mad with power. You want to see Hit Monkey find a more peaceful life, Haruka to find the killer that took out her police force, Bryce to reconnect with his daughter, and the tragedy of watching Akiko fall further and further down the rabbit hole of revenge and get egged on by the spirit of the original Lady Bullseye.\n\nThe new characters are fun to watch interact around our deadly duo, and the ex-hitmen have a fun powers and interesting backstories. Granted, not all of them get the same treatment and fleshed-out backstory, but some of the backstories that unravel around some of the ex-killers are truly messed up and tragic. This is where some of the problems from the first season continue into the second season. I know most folks are getting tired of the same Deadpool-style writing and quirky sensibilities in characters, and I would lie if I didn’t find the comedy that came from Bryce grating at points. It doesn’t help that the quippy nature of the comedy bleeds into the other characters in the show. It’s not like I never got a laugh out of the humor, but the self-awareness of it all feels clunky at points. Have you ever been in a situation where it feels like everyone wants to have the punchline or the last laugh? It’s like that at points, and more control over the dialogue needed to happen. Yes, this whole show’s premise is absurd and you have to have a very tongue-in-cheek approach to balancing out the lightweight and heavier moments, but it’s a show where the more dramatic moments worked better for me than the comedy. Bryce is the biggest offender of the show’s comedy, where he is constantly snarking on everything and is constantly called out for his snark. It’s a bummer, because Jason Sudeikis can deliver a genuinely funny line and can hit the more dramatic moments well. Due to how busy this show can feel, the plot line with Bryce’s daughter and her reconnecting with him gets the weakest conclusion, and she isn’t the most interesting character. The characters that interact around her are more entertaining with Rob Corddry’s character, who is a cleaner and gives Bryce’s daughter Iris her first job in the world of being a cleaner. Their interactions were some of the highlights of the season. The villains who own the mystical weapons aren’t the most interesting characters with the last one they target having the most personality, but they are more of a goal/building block to get to the actual villains and the core of the story.\n\nThe animation looks great. If you are familiar with the hit series Archer, and that show’s animation style, then you will get a similar experience here if you enjoyed Archer’s more action-focused episodes. There are times when the blurriness of the backgrounds and the animation can sometimes be a little hard to follow and look wonky, but the animation rigs are fantastic, the environments give off so much personality and atmosphere, and the designs are appealing. Even when the action can get a little blurry, much of the action is dynamic, thrilling, and hits hard when it needs to. Outside of the action, the show just looks good, and it has a distinct visual look for a generally adult-focused animated series, which is something most animation fans seem to not be able to be loud and supportive of when it happens. The voice cast is once again stellar with Fred Tatasciore’s role as the titular monkey. While it is all grunts and animal noses, he still brings out so much emotion in the character. You can tell what they are saying and thinking even without the subtitles or the other characters knowing what he is saying. The rest of the voice cast, old and new, are also great. Stephanie Beatriz is always a delight to hear, Keith David playing the devil is a lot of fun, Olivia Munn is as stellar as ever, Ally Maki is great, and Leslie Jones is always a win in my books. As I mentioned above, Cristin Milioti and Rob Corrdy are great in their scenes together, Reiko Aylesworth returns as the original Lady Bullseye and brings her menacing nature to conflict with Olivia Munn’s character, and we get a very layered performance from Nat Faxon, who honestly did put in probably the best performance of our antagonists, and we even get a fun appearance from Jim Gaffigan who plays this character with time manipulation.\n\nIts comedic moments may hinder the plot at points, but when Hit Monkey delivers on its dramatic storytelling and action, it’s a good time. The show is now available on Hulu (or Disney Star for the rest of the world that doesn’t have Hulu), and if you enjoyed the more action revenge thriller of the first season, I assume most fans will love this second season as it amps up the violence, but also doesn’t forget the core of this show being around our two leads and their trials and tribulations to try and find peace in their lives. Marvel and its films and shows have been going through the wringer recently with varying degrees of quality, but Hit Monkey continues to be a bright spot. Granted that bright spot is riddled with sword slashes, bullet holes, and gruesome gory bits, but it’s a good time that kept me compelled from start to finish.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Outside of a handful of family and children-based series, there hasn’t quite been a show or movie I have seen that has hit it out of the park. Central Park got canceled after three seasons, Luck was their first real foray into original feature animation that didn’t do well critically or viewership-wise, causing Apple to cut ties with Skydance Animation before they jumped ship to Netflix, and outside of Cartoon Saloon/Tom Moore’s Wolfwalkers, not many people talk about their animation stuff. It’s a shame, because I do like their Frog and Toad series, and Apple has enough faith in their work to not just cancel everything left and right like Netflix and Max do. The whole thing with Skydance is bizarre, because Apple was gearing up to have them on board as their version of Pixar, since they have now disgraced head of Pixar, John Lasseter, as one of the brains behind the studio. So then, we have a studio that has yet to make something that has a lasting impression, and now we have a new TV series that sadly, falls under the same failings as their feature film direction with Wondla.\n\nBased on the book series by Tony DiTerlizzi, this series follows Eva, a human who was born in an underground sanctuary where humans have lived for generations due to the world above not being viable anymore. One day, she decides to break out of her sanctuary to discover the world above, finding herself on a journey to figure out what exactly happened, and to where all of the humans have vanished. Along the way, she is joined by her robot mother figure, Muther, a large tardigrade named Otto, and a pathfinder alien named Rovender. Can Eva find out what happened to this once human-filled world and avoid the dangers that it entails?\n\nAfter having seen shows like Radford Sechrist’s Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts and Amazon Prime’s Fallout series, Wondla had a lot to prove, not only as yet another post-apocalyptic TV series, but for Skydance Animation. Sadly, what we do get is not all that impressive. On one hand, it has a decent story and a cast of mostly entertaining characters that do set up some interesting pieces of lore and world-building. The alien-like world Earth has become is full of mystery as to what exactly happened and how the world has changed. Some of the characters like Rovender are interesting characters that have hints or reveals of what makes them tick. While the animation is simply okay, since the quality is on the same level of their previous endeavor with Luck, I like the more nature-based locations than the wasteland-based areas. They feel more lived-in and fleshed-out than most of the other locations we have seen. While I have issues with how the characters are written, for the small moments that are there, I do like Eva and Muther’s interactions. They are the heart of this story, and there is a found family theme with this show that I do like.\n\nSadly, what we get is a fairly traditional post-apocalypse adventure with story beats that land where you know they will land, and the surprises and discoveries that we find are predictable and land with a thud. Not that being overly familiar is a bad thing, since I have seen films and shows that are basic, but are executed with such passion that you don’t care. I found myself constantly waiting for the plot points and twists to drop, and that doesn’t make it better when most of the characters are flat and uninteresting. The voice cast that includes Jeanie Mason, Gary Anthony Williams, Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Chike Okonkwo, D.C. Douglas, and Alan Tudyk are doing their best to make the material work, but due to how there are only seven episodes in this first season, you don’t get much time to be with them. There is no time for them to chill out or to make the reveals feel more natural. That’s been a big problem with a lot of recent streaming series, where studios are paying less and less for multi-episode seasons, and what we get are either broken-up movie-style experiences or shows that don’t have time to make everything work. This happened with the Hazbin Hotel series, and it happens here. An extra few episodes would have helped make the story feel more compelling and developed. Even the twists that are revealed don’t leave a lasting impact. There is a moment where you are brought to a new kingdom, and instead of letting the story discuss corruption in power and memories, for the most part, things wrap up nicely. That whole story beat does not get brought up a lot or help expand on what happened with the humans that used to live there.\n\nWhile the cast is talented, the performances are a mixed bag. Gary Anthony Williams is the best actor of the bunch even though his performance makes me wonder if they originally wanted George Takei, due to how he comes off like he’s trying to do a Takei-style cadence. Brad Garret does fine as the more lightweight goofy Otto, and Teri Hatcher and Jeanie Mason are fine, but good lord does John Ratzenebrger sound like he was drunk and his acting falls very flat. Chike does what he can to make a bounty hunter character work, but again, the characters in this show are simply not interesting. The animation itself just doesn’t look great for a TV series. There are some nice touches with the eye animation and some of the designs are interesting, but the texture work makes it look less than stellar. It reminds me of adventure games from the early PlayStation 3 days, or at least what I remember of that time in graphical quality. It results in a fairly generic visual look that would have probably been better if the artists were given more time to make more interesting worlds and designs, or the studio wasn’t being run by a man who has lost all of his creative juices back when he thought Cars 2 was a good idea.\n\nSadly, Wondla has come out at a time when the post-apocalypse genre has evolved and gone further than what we get with this show. Maybe the supposed second season will make up for what season one has been lacking, but who knows if we will get a second season. While it was confirmed this got a second-season order, it has been shown that companies like Netflix will cancel shows that were greenlit for second seasons. It isn’t the worst show I have seen since the Good Times reboot on Netflix was awful, but it doesn’t rise to the occasion that something like X-Men 97 did. With the current state of the entertainment industry, there are so many movies and shows coming out, and being just okay doesn’t cut it. It also doesn’t help that some studios and companies are relying on an entirely faulty algorithm to give notes to creatives when they need to let creatives thrive and make their work stand out. Maybe this is what the books are like or maybe this was a bad adaptation hampered by production nonsense. I wish I liked this more because I’m always down for atmospheric and sci-fi mystery experiences. Honestly, I’m down for most types of experiences with animation. Skydance Animation has simply put, not released something worthwhile, and while I’m hoping for the best for their upcoming projects, Luck and Wondla has not put out a good impression of what they are crafting, or if they will put out something creative as long as John Lasseter is there. If you do want to check out a sci-fi post-apocalypse series, then go watch Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts. Maybe there is just no wonder in Wondla, so hopefully, they will show me the wonderland that they promise in the future.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nTo be blunt, Spring 2024, while having some fantastic titles as per usual with the season, I wouldn’t call this a super strong season for new shows. It honestly felt like a summer anime season where there was a ton of filler, and the good titles were very obvious as to what they would be. Much of the potential in some shows ended up being squandered, and others took too long to get to the actual heart and soul of why you should care. Even some oddities like some titles were not even getting brought over. There were interesting takeaways, whether they be an entire genre regressing since the previous seasonal drop, or remembering that yes, despite how many anime, new and returning are released, there is always something worth watching. That’s the thing, anime will always be a fantastic foundation for storytelling since animation is just so diverse. Even when the anime industry sometimes pumps out the most garbage shows, you will always find something to watch that got the production time, talent, and team to craft a beautiful experience. Overall, I watched 32 shows from the non-returning shows and here are my takeaways.\n\nAnime watched this season and where you can watch them\n\nViral Hit (Crunchyroll)\n\nGo! Go! Loser Ranger (Disney+/Hulu)\n\nMission: Yozakura Family (Hulu)\n\nKaiju No. 8 (Crunchyroll)\n\nWind Breaker (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe Banished Hero Lives as He Pleases (Crunchyroll)\n\nUnnamed Memory (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe New Gate (Crunchyroll)\n\nRe: Monster (Crunchyroll)\n\nI Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince (Crunchyroll)\n\nAn Archdemon’s Dilemma: How to Love Your Elf Bride (Crunchyroll)\n\nChillin in Another World with Level 2 Super Cheat Skills (Crunchyroll)\n\nAs a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World (Crunchyroll)\n\nYatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose the Lord (Crunchyroll)\n\nStudio Apartment, Good Lighting, Angel Included (Crunchyroll)\n\nGrandma and Grandpa Turn Young Again (Crunchyroll)\n\nSalad Bowl of Eccentrics (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe Many Sides of Voice Actor Radio (Crunchyroll)\n\nAstro Note (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe Fable (Disney/Hulu)\n\nVampire Dormitory (Crunchyroll)\n\nWhisper Me a Love Song (HiDive)\n\nA Condition Called Love (Crunchyroll)\n\nTadaima, Okaeri (Crunchyroll)\n\nHighspeed Etoile (Crunchyroll)\n\nOblivion Battery (Crunchyroll)\n\nTonbo (Amazon Prime)\n\nGods’ Games We Play (Crunchyroll)\n\nMysterious Disappearances (Crunchyroll)\n\nJellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night (HiDive)\n\nTrain to the End of the World (Crunchyroll)\n\nTonari no Youkai-san (Crunchyroll)\n\nTakeaway 1: Isekais/fantasy anime regressed this season!\n\nOne of the first things I noticed with this season is that the isekai/fantasy genre took a rather large step backward in overall quality over last season. Whereas I could list four to five fantasy/isekai shows I loved from the previous season, there aren’t that many here. Some like The New Gate try to have some interesting twists on the formula. It started as a battle royale anime and then quickly shifted into another isekai title in the first episode. That was interesting, but it just didn’t want to explore what it laid out, and that’s a huge issue through most of the fantasy isekai shows this season. Why should I care? The Banished Former Hero Lives as He Pleases is painfully generic with a whole slew of fantasy/isekai tropes smashed together in what might be the cheapest-looking anime of the season. That’s saying something due to how there are a few shows that did not get the time and budget they probably wanted, but The Banished Former Hero is very much on the cheap side of things. It also is possibly the worst anime of the season. Re: Monster almost goes an interesting route with our lead being transformed into a goblin and then follows his growth of becoming stronger, but then it introduces more typical power fantasy slop that we have already seen before. Oh, and since it’s an anime with goblins, it has heavily implied elements of goblins kidnapping human women to breed with them because, well, Goblin Slayer became big, and heaven forbid an anime with goblins in it ever be normal. Honestly, Re: Monster is a mediocre version of Reincarnated as a Slime and does everything Slime does, but worse. Heck, it even gives us a reason why our lead has this devouring ability because he was supposedly a cannibal in the past life, which is never really brought up during the show’s story. It’s more in favor of rushing through the progress and getting to the harem stuff than being a good show.\n\nReincarnated as the 7th Prince has vibrant animation, but it doesn’t cover up the more “ick” elements like the older women lusting after a child. It’s frustrating because you can tell the team was having fun with the animation and some aspects of the story, but when you look at everything else, it falls apart. Chilling in Another World with Level 2 Super Cheat Skills has some potentially interesting world-building, like our lead coming from a world that enslaves humanoid beast/ogre people and then comes to a world with an outwardly more progressive world. Sadly, it still goes down the route of typical generic isekai fluff, with a harem, inconsistent and sometimes rough comedy, and results in yet another anime that has the lead chilling, but not really, because they got worried that people would get bored by slice-of-life fantasy shows. Someday, I truly do need to make an editorial talking about isekais needing to get good for once. As a Reincarnated Aristocrat at the very least, while an isekai and has a child character with some of the same issues as Reincarnated as the 7th Prince, has the decency to let our lead’s super powerful ability be passive. Instead of being the most powerful person with no flaws, he finds the best aspects of folks and makes sure they follow those paths. Granted, there are arguments made about why this premise is messed up, but it’s something. An Archfiend’s Dilemma has the unfortunate trope of slavery with its two leads, and while it doesn’t look the best, and so far has some forgettable side characters, the story about two broken folks trying to help each other is a sweet one. Even then though, when there was only one show I found in this category to be good, which was Yatagarasu, then that’s saying something in terms of how terrible this genre was this season. I know some anime fans are mad at how isekai keeps getting turned into a punching bag, but when so many fantasy/isekai shows get released every year, then people are going to be critical of them.\n\nTakeaway 2: Why are we being picky now about what we bring over?\n\nSo, I mentioned back in the last editorial about how companies like Crunchyroll are essentially picking up almost everything under the sun. Well, except they aren’t. Some distributors, now of all times to start, are being picky about bringing over everything. Sure, bring over every isekai slop fest, but we can’t get the presumably charming-looking Girls Band Cry? Why be picky now since Girls Band Cry and Rinkai didn’t get picked up. These distributors will bring over anime based on video games that will frankly shut down in a year unless they are one of the few lucky ones to keep surviving after a year, but are they shows that folks want to see? Yeah, sure I guess it’s hard to know what will get an audience and the only way we can be sure is if we bring it all over, but we aren’t getting every anime every season anyway. Also, why are we being picky with what gets a dub first? I get there is no real rhyme or reason as to when dubs get greenlit or why some of the worst anime of the season get dubs first over the genuinely loved ones, but it would be so much easier to take in some shows when there is a dub to watch. I don’t mind subs or dubs, but the fact some of the more dialogue-driven shows don’t have them over middling isekai garbage is rather odd to say the least.\n\nTakeaway 3: Lots of potential in premises were wasted/underutilized!\n\nDo you know what anime from this season like Unnamed Memory, Oblivion Battery, Gods’ Games We Play, Grandma and Grandpa Turn Young Again, and others have in common? All had premises that could have led to some amazing experiences that then didn’t do anything, or stumbled in the execution department of providing the fully realized vision of what they wanted to bring to the table. At least with Astro Note, you can say why you love or dislike this show, and that will be understandable or be the reason why you love it. Unnamed Memory’s drive is supposedly about the relationship/dynamic of our lead, a prince who needs a curse broken on him by the witch with whom he makes a pact, but their romance is not compelling at all. Mysterious Disappearances has an interesting mystery hook to our author lead and the supernatural horrors that await, but the tone and choice of comedy revolving around our author lead’s figure hurt the overall experience for me. Oblivion Battery is a MAPPA production, so, of course, it has good animation, but the characters are deeply unpleasant to be around. They are obnoxious to a T, and the designs are unappealing. I want to get into the drama between the two baseball players and their broken friendship, but the annoying comedy doesn’t help this show at all. In the end, I wish I liked it more. The Gods’ Games We Play is, simply put, really boring, when an anime about gods forcing humans to play a random set of games should be exciting. Too bad it follows the sin of having characters explain why they are so smart instead of showing us how smart they are. Who cares what happens since they are just going to tell us what happened instead? It’s just a generic-looking anime. We have seen bargain bin designs and visuals so many times and even got compared to the also dreadful Liar Liar from a few seasons ago due to how blah the visuals look. Grandma and Grandpa Turn Young Again might have one of the worst first episodes of any show this season, where it feels like it’s going to be this interesting quirky drama of an old couple turning to young adults again after eating a special apple. It has those moments, but you have to sit through some of the most mediocre comedy of the season, as well as jokes that range from the small chuckle to the very uncomfortable. If it also didn’t have such a lackluster visual look, it would be more tolerable when it does suddenly shift into the more dramatic parts of the story. Tonbo is one of two golf anime that we are getting this year, and while it has a decent enough retro-vibe of a young girl who loves golf and a grizzled mentor who learns how to love golf again, boy howdy, did something happen for the dub to be one of the worst of the decade so far. Also, good luck trying to find info on the dub, because there is no info on who the voice cast is. I normally should be down with a new racing anime after Overtake!, but instead, Highspeed Etoille wastes its premise of futuristic racing with the inclusion of AI racers by making us wait to learn about our leads until the third episode, with mostly dialogue being delivered by side characters, and it’s all wrapped up in ugly CGI animation and overly detailed character designs. Luckily, some shows do come close to feeling more cohesive like Viral Hit with its dark comedy commentary about the issues of bullying and the need to be famous by any means. You know, like a viral hit. It doesn’t feel as cohesive as it should, and its animation and designs are not the most appealing to look at, but it at least has more focus on its premise than other shows in this season.\n\nIt’s always a bummer when you can see the potential of an amazing show that then flounders or takes too long for the payoff to be worthwhile. I know some folks will like the shows I listed in reference here, and that’s fine if ya do, but these are my takeaways. Not gonna lie about how I feel about these shows. Some shows do set up something promising, but the thing is that the creators are not being adventurous or productions aren’t doing enough to make these interesting. Heck, maybe not every story needs to be adapted into anime.\n\nTakeaway 4: As Usual, Good Narratives and Characters Hit Home Runs\n\nAs usual, the best anime of the season doesn’t just have the flashiest animation or is the next big adaptation of a popular series. At its core, every anime that people will love and remember, live and die by their story and characters. Kaiju No. 8 offers a dark comedy spin on the typical hyped series with our lead not only being an actual adult character, but one who can turn into a human kaiju hybrid to battle the giant monstrosities. His motivations are easy to identify with, and his colorful cast of fellow kaiju fighters are fun to see bounce off of one another.\n\nYatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose Its Master is a little dense in the dialogue department, as you venture through this web of fantasy-set political drama and see how the twists and turns unravel in the story and its many interesting players as they reach the cream of the crop on the royalty ladder, portraying what they have to do to get there. I wish it had a dub though, because it would have made it easier to take in everything. Go Go Loser Rangers with its twist of the villains being the rangers that keep the immortal henchmen of the villain organization alive for entertainment is a clever hook on the Power Rangers premise. It’s wild how so many anime this season don’t have this clever of a premise or a commitment to the bit that they set up. Following our lead going undercover to take down the rangers from the inside is a lot of fun with compelling characters and biting social commentary. Train to the End of the World offers an enticing mystery to the world that it has created after the world falls under the effects of G7 technology, as we follow a group of girls traversing by train across an unknown world to find their friend. Wind Breaker not only has amazing action animation, but a story of a young man forming a found family/friendship with a group of delinquent boys, who aren’t even bad folks due to how they help out and protect a small town from other gangs. One of the biggest hits of the season was Jellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night, a mind-blowing mature experience,in which we follow a young woman traversing her life in the city chasing the dream and finding her artistic identity with the help of an ex-pop star. While it isn’t the best romance anime of the season, watching the duo in A Condition Called Love work out what they want in a romantic relationship makes for some compelling stuff, even if the lead can sometimes be a creepy individual with what he’s willing to do to be with our other lead. Funny enough, you can completely ignore the Omegaverse stuff with Taidama, Okaeri, because it’s otherwise a lovely little show about a gay couple living in the suburbs trying to live a peaceful and loving life. Whisper Me a Love Song is one of the best girl love romance anime of the year, with its focus on our two leads, a guitarist and her crush. Tonari no Yokai-san offers a low-key slice-of-life experience where humans and yokai live together as they ponder some serious questions like the meaning of life, and finding one’s journey and goals. All of these anime and a few others mentioned throughout this editorial made sure their goal was that they wanted to give you narratively satisfying and compelling shows. If we don’t care about the story or its characters, then why should we bother to watch them? Anime is such an oddity in some ways in the world of animated storytelling with it being unabashedly unafraid to go in weird and compelling directions with the stories they want to tell, and to give you an array of characters to laugh at/with, relate to, and follow.\n\nTakeaway 5: Disney, you have to start advertising the anime you got!\n\nWhile I already mentioned Go Go Loser Rangers, it isn’t the only anime this season that they picked up. They picked up The Fable, a dark comedy about a hitman trying to lay low, Mission: Yozakura Family, a spy action comedy with a family full of quirky Dangonrampa-feeling characters bringing a boy who lost his whole family into their folds, and of course, the adaptation of the late great Akira Toriyama’s Sand Land. So, why does it feel like, outside of Loser Rangers, none of these shows are receiving the attention they deserve? It’s because while Disney wants to get into the anime game, they don’t want to take the time to advertise the shows themselves. I don’t think most folk will know about these shows. Yes, almost up to 60 shows pop up every season, but you would think the biggest entertainment film company in the world would want to advertise the shows they buy. They have many amazing shows, but no one knows about them because of a lack of marketing. I know Crunchyroll is the big fish in the pond that swallows everything up, but Disney has no excuse why they won’t advertise this stuff. It’s frustrating because everyone already and understandably follows the biggest anime, and sometimes, my favorites are not the big returning shows, but the new stuff.\n\nTakeaway 6: Maybe it’s time to stop making so much anime?\n\nThis was partly a joke takeaway because as much as it is crippling and hurting the anime industry to be pumping out anime at such a veracity resulting in more or less 20% of the shows being good, it isn’t going to stop until Japan changes the laws around anime production. But man, wouldn’t it be nice not to have to travel through the sea of anime that gets released every three months? 60 or so titles are way too many, and not everyone is going to watch or want to invest in so many, when they are going to always go towards the popular returning shows and the big titles that are hyped up for release. Creatives are pumping out stories faster than before, and it’s not sustainable when the industry is, simply put, not future-proofing their industry. There are high burnout rates, lack of pay, and now studios are trying to get into the whole AI thing that will damage the industry more than help it. Still, 32 shows was a lot, and the industry needs to stop adapting for the sake of adapting something to turn into a franchise when you are going to end up with slop most of the time.\n\nAnime I recommend from the Spring 2024 Season\n\nWind Breakers, Go Go Loser Rangers, Jellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night, Kaiju No. 8, Tonari no Yokai-san, Whisper Me a Love Song, Train to the End of the World, Mission: Yozakura Family, Yatagarasu.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

I honestly had no idea what was coming out this year in the world of overseas animation, because so many of these productions take years to get done and are in various states of finished or in production. It always makes me excited to see what we get here, because not only do we see some truly lovely pieces of animated art, it is also an indication of what we could see at my favorite film festival, Animation is Film. It can come down to a case of me putting on a Sherlock Holmes or for anime fans, Sherlock Hound costume and seeing what will be coming to the amazing California-based Animation is Film Festival. I’ll also be sharing some thoughts on other recent foreign animation announcements. Here are my thoughts!\n\nWhat Will Probably Show Up There\n\nGhost Cat Anzu\n\nThe Colors Within\n\nThe Most Precious of Cargoes\n\nMemoir of a Snail\n\nWild\n\nTotto Chan: The Little Girl at the Window\n\nThe new Wallace and Gromit Movie\n\nWhy These?: For me, these are the films I think will be the biggest gets for Animation is Film. I chose these due to them either already having distributors like Ghost Cat Anzu and The Colors Within, showing up at festivals before Annecy like The Most Precious of Cargoes competing at Cannes, and or the directors themselves. Who wouldn’t want to see a brand new stop-motion film from Mary and Max director Adam Elliot (his new film is Memoir of a Snail) or the new film by the director of Oscar-nominated My Life as a Zucchini that’s called Wild, Claude Barras? Some of these also seem like easy choices like the fact the new Wallace and Gromit film being previewed at Annecy will show up at Animation is Film for Netflix to advertise what will probably be their big award contender for the Oscars and The Annies alongside The Imaginary and Ultraman: Rising. Totto Chan has been a fairly quiet film that has been getting hype the more folks have discovered its existence. I know many would probably guess The Imaginary from Studio Ponoc would be here, but since they are releasing it onto the service on July 5th, they won’t be showing it off here. It’s a shame because it would look amazing on the big screen, but Netflix has a weird hate/love relationship with the theatrical experience.\n\nWhat Will Hopefully Show Up There\n\nChang’an\n\nThe Storm\n\nWhy These?: No Animation is Film is without some amazing and vibrant looks at the world of the animation scene from China, and they tend to usually have films from Lightchasers Animation with Chang’an being an obvious fit for the festival. Granted, it’s three hours long, but hey, as long as it’s paced well, the runtime doesn’t matter. It would be a cool change of pace to see a three-hour animated feature film get a release at the festival. I also think The Storm has a chance due to its vibrant 2D animation and its connections with the director’s previous film, Da Hu Fa aka The Guardian. It would be a great case to keep showing how fantastic the Chinese animation scene has become and hope that both films get brought over.\n\nWhat Might Show Up There\n\nA Boat in the Garden\n\nRock Bottom\n\nFlow\n\nGill\n\nThe Glassworker\n\nThe Wild Robot Preview?\n\nMoana 2 preview\n\nElio Preview?\n\nThe Umbrella Fairy\n\nWhy These?: While Animation is Film is one of the most beautiful ways to see a fantastic world of art that anyone can get into and hopefully partake in, the fact is that they are going to choose what they can and will only pick out the best of the best for this festival. A Boat in the Garden is by the famed director Jean Francois Laguionie, but his previous film didn’t show up at Animation is Film so it’s a real 50/50 chance that it may or may not be. Flow from Gints Zilbalodis who made the Annecy-winning Away could make it, but since Flow didn’t make it to Animation is Film 2019, who knows if this one will as well. Sometimes South Korean animation shows up at Animation is Film, but it’s not frequent and Gill could make it, depending on the reception it gets at Annecy. The Glassworker might get some push due to how it’s Pakistan’s first 2D animated film and that would be fun to see and receive the support it could get. It depends on what the reception and where they would put it in the runtime. As for the big studio previews, we know they will have a preview for Moana 2, because Disney always has an animated film preview there at the festival. I know The Wild Robot is probably coming out at the end of September, but do we even think that’s gonna happen? This film’s trailer was one of the biggest hits of the year, and yet I feel like it might get pushed back into November/December due to the animation strike, if studios decided to play stupid again like they did last year. But if that happens, we could see a preview of it. We might see a preview of Elio from Pixar. I don’t think we will, but who knows? The Umbrella Fairy is one of the newest animated films from China and it has some stylish visuals that look amazing, but with how random and inconsistent the US distributors are with bringing over films from China, who knows if we will get this one.\n\nWith all that said, all of these are just predictions, and who knows what will show up. I’m sure I am right about the ones that are going to be there, but I could also be wrong. It’s up in the air and depends on what contracts get signed and delivered for Animation is Film to get their line-up for the festival. Either way, I think all of these will be good movies, and I can’t wait to see what will show up at the festival. As always, I hope they announce it sooner than a month out from the festival.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nThe Winter 2024 season has been a wild ride of what we have seen coming from an industry that is in dire need of change. It’s a slow change, as we deal with said slow change to the industry and how it treats its animators and seeing the shows that get greenlit. New and returning titles flood the airwaves via Crunchyroll, Netflix, HiDive, and Hulu/Disney+. While there are a few terrible shows this season, it might have the biggest gap between high-quality, mid-quality, low-quality, and terrible shows that I have ever seen. The terrible stuff is vastly smaller than the amount of great stuff, and even the other stuff is from mostly good, fine, to nothing worth talking about. I am going to try and go a little bit of a different route with this editorial since I want to talk about my biggest takeaways of the season. I still watched an array of new non-returning shows per usual, but after a while, with so many shows coming out and so many tending to have the same problems, it’s more interesting to talk about the big takeaways from the season.\n\nTakeaway #1: Isekai/fantasy shows decided to Step It Up!\n\nThe fantasy/isekai genre can be a very hit-and-miss genre, and more times than not, a lot of the most mediocre shows every season come from this genre. So many want to be the new Re-Zero or whatever big isekai is still big, and that has led to many creatives either missing the point or cannibalizing each other. They all think an overpowered lead and a harem is all that you need instead of interesting characters, worldbuilding, and a compelling story. Whether it’s because the titles getting adapted are getting better or they are picking better properties to adapt, the fantasy/isekai genre was way better this season than usual. Whether it was Delicious in Dungeon, which combined a fantasy dungeon crawler with cooking and environmentalism, The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic and its zany boot camp journey of our lead learning to be a healer, The Weakest Tamer Began a Journey Picking Up Trash’s self-healing journey of discovery and taming monsters, 7th Time Loop’s Edge of Tomorrow style of storytelling with our lead’s backstory of trying to survive and end ups courting the villain in her previous lifespan, Villainess Level 99: I May Be The Hidden Boss, but I’m Not The Demon Lord!’s silly twist on the villainess subgenre with our main character being the hidden boss of the visual novel that wanted to be ignored but then became priority number 1, and you get the idea. It was refreshing to not have to sit through so much fantasy/isekai stuff that wasn’t male empowerment or just another bog standard experience with no flair. Not that every fantasy/isekai show was good, but…\n\nTakeaway #2: Even middling titles had something of note!\n\nSomething I noticed this season was that I wasn’t finding myself as frustrated or constantly disappointed with the shows I was checking out. Even the more middling experiences had something of note that made them more interesting than most. The Undead Unwanted Adventurer, while needing more time to cook, was a compelling beginning with our hero being revived as a skeleton after a horrific dragon attack in a dungeon. The Strongest Tank takes from the genre of fantasy shows where someone with a specific class from RPGs is seen as inferior, and while I like the base dynamic of our lead’s bond with his sister, these types of shows dive way too much into the harem genre that quickly derails them, and the fact the supposed harem looks to be of young girls is not helping the matter. But the fact our lead was a more defensive character was something we don’t often see with these shows. Too bad the reasoning behind their departure from the hero’s party is never as captivating as the premise should be. Delusional Monthly Magazine was a wild swing-and-miss original property that feels like it could quite pick between being the life of a weird monthly magazine or some globetrotting supernatural adventure. Fluffy Paradise may have been basic and more low-key with its focus on a lead who got turned into a child in a fantasy world, but the fact it captures the love and feeling of just wanting to cuddle and chill with friendly animals makes for an appealing if not urgent watch. Sasaaki and Peeps has a ton of different hooks, such as having an adult male lead obtain a pet bird who happens to be a magical wizard. It is also an odd isekai premise where our lead can traverse between two worlds and then gets enrolled with helping to take down psychics. It is an original idea, but your mileage will vary depending on how much you feel invested with this combination of things. Dr Elise is another isekai where our lead has been reincarnated in a different world multiple times and goes from the real world to the fantasy world once more, and just so happens to be a skilled medic. The show plants an interesting seed of a premise, but doesn’t quite make the landing with the world and character being as compelling as they need to be. Chained Soldier and Tales of the Wedding Rings offer mix-ups with their takes on the fantasy worlds in which they pull us. Tales of the Wedding Rings falls apart due to the harem element taking center stage, leaving the writing and animation to take a hit. With its writing and building up character relationships as our lead is sent on a quest to get a harem due to magic reasons to protect the kingdom, it at least has more going on under the hood than others. Chained Soldier has a mix of action, harem, and ecchi elements with a world where women gain powers to take down monsters, and sexual shenanigans happen on the side. It at least put in the footwork to make the male lead likable, and the dynamics with the women he is staying with are likable enough to not make it just a show where the viewer has to sit through the creative’s BDSM fetish. If you can walk away and say “Hey, I didn’t vibe with it, but I admire what it was doing” then that’s better than walking away feeling like you earned nothing through the experience. Even then…\n\nTakeaway #3: Despite the bloat, some titles are still surprising!\n\nI always love to be surprised by the shows we watch, and I am always going to be down with shows that catch me off-guard with how much I enjoy them. Although it came out a tad late during the seasonal drop, Bang Brave Bravern is a callback to old-school mecha anime, with all of the world-building and political asides mixed with giant robot action and very homoerotic overtones that make for a charming series with some stellar action. The Witch and the Beast offers up a supernatural buddy-cop dynamic between a mage and a woman who must track down the witch who cursed her. We get some stellar action and captivating mysteries as we finally have a killer fantastical mystery anime that I haven’t seen since the summer season last year with Undead Murder Farce. Metallic Rogue is an original anime from Studio Bones, with a cool sci-fi dystopian action show that may be light on the exposition, but heavy on the vibes, likable leads, and killer action. Tis Time for Torture offers a comedic take on a demon general trying to interrogate a princess about her kingdom’s secrets using delicious-looking food and video games to force her to crack under pressure. Mr Villain’s Day Off captures the relatability of trying to have a day off, even when you are a general in an evil army that is constantly at battle with a Power Rangers-like group of heroes. All he wants is to not deal with coworkers, and enjoy time looking at the panda at the zoo. Romance anime gave us a trio of three hits with A Sign of Affection being the best one of the bunch, as we follow the romantic tension between a deaf woman and a guy who wants to be a part of her world. It’s such an endearing and lovable series that shows us the world from her perspective which makes for a heartwarming romantic experience. If you are starving for something similar to My New Boss is Goofy, the more Yaoi-focused Cherry Magic! has a goofy little premise of our lead gaining mind-reading powers due to turning 30 as a virgin, but his dynamic with his coworker who has a crush on our lead is heartfelt, spicy, and is a good follow-up for those that loved My New Boss is Goofy. While the Demon Prince of Momochi House is a bit melodramatic and takes some time to wind up its mystery of the mansion, its inhabitants, and the romance between our leads, the visuals and chemistry between our two leads result in a real solid romance anime. No matter the number of shows released, we tend to get a lot of good ones, but with that said how many anime we get…\n\nTakeaway #4: Why did we get Snack Basue and Gushing Over Magical Girls?\n\nEven though anime companies are willing to sell the rights to every new show during every seasonal drop, we still don’t get every title. It’s funny, because every once in a while, there will be an anime from random seasonal drops that just don’t show up until either way later on some streaming service, or just gets pirated online with folks crafting fan subs for them. Now, to some degree, I get it. Why bring over an anime that may or may not be attached to a show or property that is big or at least more well-known in Japan than the States and why would they think it would do well here? But that seems to be an even smaller case that barely happens. Still, no one can watch all of these shows, especially when you have a total of 50+ shows at times, and it feels like a shotgun approach is taken these days. Bringing over anything and everything no matter if it looks appealing or has any chance of being a hit can be a hit-or-miss propostion. So why do we get titles like Snack Basue, which has no real wide appeal, absurdly cheap-looking animation, and is about a nightlife culture that most fans and viewers aren’t going to know about? I should love this zany weird comedy, but something either doesn’t and won’t translate to an audience not familiar with the style of comedy they are going for, and with the bad animation, the jokes don’t land as well as they should. Gushing Over Magical Girls I can understand a bit more, since everyone loves a good magical girl deconstruction, but when a lot of it is based around BDSM fetish with middle school-aged characters that becomes fairly explicit, it makes you wonder who this is for outside of a very questionable group of folks who would enjoy this type of show. We don’t get Pon no Michi, a show about a group of girls running a mahjong parlor, but we get these two that have a way smaller viewer base. It just makes you wonder where the priorities are, and prompts a discussion about the point of ecchi anime or anime that borderlines on pornography or much more problematic stuff, but that’s a topic for another time. For now, another takeaway I had was…\n\nTakeaway #5: So much violence!\n\nSomething that I noticed between shows like Solo Leveling, Ishura, Sengoku Youko, and Meiji Gekken: 1874 was that the blood and violence levels were higher than usual. Not that they were all at the levels of the stuff you would see in the OVA boom from the late 80s and early 90s, but you normally don’t see this much unless it was something like Attack on Titan. With dismembered limbs, folks getting sliced in half, and you get the idea, they use violence as a means to show how dangerous the world is. Solo Leveling builds up the dangers of the dungeons and leads to training to get stronger with everyone getting slaughtered in the first two episodes. While struggling to balance out its historical and silly anime action beats, Meiji Gekken uses it to show the brutality of war and humans. Ishura delivers a world on the constant brink of war and bloodshed with multiple strong individuals all meeting and or roaming the earth for the next big battle they must overcome to become the main hero. Sengoku Youko uses its violence in its samurai-era setting to show the complexity of war and the conflict between humans and demons through the eyes of our wannabe samurai who joins a human who hates other humans and a kitsune spirit that loves humanity to become stronger. It isn’t just gore for the sake of gore. They are still going to be action shows through and through, but it doesn’t mean they can’t use that violence to elevate the themes and commentary they are bringing to the experience.\n\nTakeaway #6: The mediocre titles were few and far between!\n\nHonestly, the really bad titles were few and far between for me this season. There were only two shows I would say were deeply terrible. I already talked about how mediocre and terrible Gushing Over Magical Girls was so I won’t repeat myself here. On the other hand, My Instant Death Ability is So Overpowered is meant to be a parody of the isekai genre. You can see in some small moments how obnoxious, instantly dislikable, and dull the characters are, and how it tries to shove in a lot of the slop you see in bad isekai anime. Either the fans don’t know what a satire/parody is or the team that made it decided to play everything straight when it wasn’t meant to be. It’s a tedious show to sit through and the introduction of a third character who is meant to be the comedy relief is annoying. Yeah, maybe she is meant to be annoying, but if that’s the joke, then you need a better joke. It wasn’t clever or substantial in the way this show needed to be. We can have One Punch Man-style shows with different genres, but they need to be whip-smart and creative.\n\nSo then, that is what I have to say about the Winter 2024 season. Here are the anime I highly recommend checking out on Netflix, Hulu, HiDive, and or Crunchyroll.\n\nAnime I’d Recommend in no order: Ishura, Solo Leveling, Tis Time for Torture, Delicious in Dungeon, The Witch and the Beast, Metallic Rouge, Sengoku Youko, The Weakest Tamer Began Their Journey Picking Up Trash, Cherry Magic!, A Sign of Affection, 7th Time Loop, VIllainess lvl 99, The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic, Mr. Villain’s Day Off, Bucchigiri?!, Brave Bang Bravern.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nHealth insurance is one of the most time-consuming and frustrating things to deal with as a human. You have to find new health coverages constantly, it costs money, and the varying levels of how well you are covered make it excessively tedious, making you wonder why some countries have to deal with it and not others. Surely, this can’t be something we all deal with on just our home planet, right? Well, if you want to see what the outer limits of the galaxy have to offer in terms of health insurance, we better head on over to The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy, which is produced by the talented creator Cirocco Dunlap.\n\nYou may be tempted to make comparisons between this show’s premise in tone and sci-fi elements to Rick & Morty, but the only thing that the two shows have in common is the sci-fi hijinks and splashes of violence. The show itself is more on the drama and character-focused side of things. Not that Rick & Morty has ever been that, since it has a multitude of episodes, but you can tell with the production of that show, that they had to fight to find the balance between hyper-gorefest and character-driven experiences. What we get here is more of a workplace drama, where we follow the life of our two leads, Dr Klak and Dr. Sleech, voiced by Keke Palmer and Stephanie Hsu, as they traverse their workplace and personal lives. Their friendship is put through the wringer as they discover a new potential albeit dangerous medical case.\n\nWhat works about this show is how, while it has comedy, bits and pieces of violence, and high-concept sci-fi elements, its priority is focusing on the characters and their relationships with lovers, coworkers, and friends. Not that this hasn’t been a thing, but it’s nice to see a show knows what it wants to be. The funny thing is that since this and Hazbin Hotel are the victims of production decisions made, this show only has eight episodes. The difference is that The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy uses its time wisely, and while there are underlying plots and story arcs going on, they don’t resort to telling the viewers that something happened. They show it. You never have to excuse the actual substance of the story arcs with “oh, the show implies stuff happened, so no need to show it in this medium of visual storytelling”. You see small moments of friendships, romances, and everything in-between on full display, as we see how complicated their lives can be and the jobs that they have. Not that this show isn’t funny. It’s more dry and character-based than trying to make you laugh every single minute of the episode, but the strongest aspect is the character drama. You see that this show tackles a multitude of themes, like the complicated elements of romance, looking for funding, dealing with anxiety, family, mortality, friendship, the stress of performing perfectly. Even with all the zany space stuff, the heart of the show doesn’t get lost when discussing or commentating on these topics. While it is more common to see adult-animated series focusing on the actual development of who we follow in the show, it still feels refreshing, due to every time we get one of these types of shows, we get a few others that, depending on what happened during production, ended up being the thing that we dislike about adult-animated series. It’s just nice to see characters be actual characters and not walking archetypes. Even when they aren’t throwing jokes at the screen, when they need to pull back and let the drama hit, they let it hit. There are multiple times during the eight episodes where I was surprised at how invested I was with the story unfolding and the choices they made. Who knew a fun way to engross you in this show’s world was to see the characters doing their job and following them through their personal lives and thoughts? So when the show isn’t there to make you laugh, you still have characters you like and want to follow to keep you invested in the show.\n\nAnimation-wise, it’s the usual good stuff you see from the likes of Titmouse. Yeah, adult-animation is going to have its certain look from time to time, with the exception when we get stuff like Vox Machina, Carol and the End of the World, and Scavenger’s Reign, but at least this neon-drenched visual style adds a new look for the characters. It’s meant to be in space with a multitude of alien species, so the designs should stand out and be vibrant in how much variety there is. Yeah, most of the species are humanoid, but they have an appealing flair that makes them stand out from the shows that get stuck with the more Family Guy-adjacent art styles because of issues within the production pipeline. The voice cast is delightful as Keke Palmer and Stephanie Hsu are amazing, and while she is only secondary in the overall show, Natasha Lyonne is great. It’s a treat to see three of my favorite actors right now in one show. It’s not just them who bring out stellar performances. Maya Rudolph is just wonderful as usual with her role as Dr Vlam, and has one of the sincerest moments in the first episode. One performance that surprised me was the sincerity Kieren Culkin brought to his character Dr Plowp, and how chill and supportive of a friend, coworker, and lover he is. Sam Smith was another surprise since from what I can tell, this is their first major acting gig and they did a wonderful job with playing Dr. Azel.\n\nThe Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy should retitle itself as The Best Hospital in the Galaxy because this sci-fi adult comedy shoots for the stars, and sends it hurtling through the atmosphere with a rousing success. Its mix of sci-fi, raunchy comedy, drama, vibrant visuals, has resulted in a pristine health plan that, while not saving you from a broken bone, will make ya laugh since laughter is the best medicine. The show is now out on Prime, and if you are looking for something interstellar and filled with extraterrestrials with your animation, then get some health insurance, go catch the next flight across the stars, and make sure you find yourself in the second-best hospital in the galaxy.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

There is always something impressive about the first canary down the coal mine of indie animation that breaks out because we get to see what the indie scene has to offer. The problem is that if you are the first one out, then you are going to be the blueprint for what you should and shouldn’t do with your new series. I know there has been a lot of controversy around the creator of Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel and a lot of legit criticism from both properties, but let’s take a step back and just look at Hazbin Hotel for what it is. I have gotten to see five episodes thanks to screeners, and I have some fairly mixed thoughts overall on this new show. Hyperbolic title aside, is Hell a’poppin’ or is it frozen over? Oh and please do not harass the creator, the creatives, the animators, and so on if you do not like this show. You can be respectful with your criticism without resorting to bloody death threats. Seriously, some of you need some therapy.\n\nSo, we are in a lovely vacation home in the land of Hell. Our lead character is the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, voiced by Erika Henningsen. She wants the slaughtering of her fellow folks in Hell to stop, so she, alongside her girlfriend Vaggie, voiced by Stephanie Beatriz, opens a hotel to try and fix sinners so they can go to Heaven and avoid the yearly slaughter. Sadly, it hasn’t worked out for her as their only resident is a sarcastic porn star named Angel Dust, voiced by Blake Roman. Thankfully, Charlie gets the help of a powerful overlord and patron in the form of Alastor the Radio Demon, voiced by Amir Talai. Along the way, Charlie will get help from the chaotic Niffty, voiced by Kimiko Glenn, a cat demon named Husk, voiced by Keith David, and once rival now friend Sir Pentious, voiced by Alex Brightman. Can they get this hotel up and running before the next extermination of Hell’s citizens? What truly is happening behind the scenes with the characters in this world?\n\nLet’s start with the animation, since this is one of the more recent examples where we can go from pilot to show, and now we know that Spindle Horse and Bento Box were behind the animation behind the series. Granted, most of the animation was handled by Bento Box, but recently it was confirmed that Spindle Horse helped out at the end of the season. Of course, every show’s art style is going to be hit or miss with different folks, and don’t blame Bento Box for why a lot of the shows they work on look like they do. We all should know that a lot of production pipelines don’t or won’t result in stylish looking characters, when all they can do is try their best with simple designs and hope they work. I find Vizie’s designs to be a bit too complicated and busy, but they were toned down from the pilot to now with some getting some distinct improvements like Charlie being a bit taller than her pilot counterpart. I wish they worked on improving a little bit about Alastor and the messy complicated way voodoo is implemented into his powers. Though I think while the animation is more consistent and better than the pilot, which tends to happen, there are some parts where they either didn’t have time to work it out or make some scenes look less clunky. There are moments where characters are off-model, but unless you go looking for them, you won’t notice. Maybe they could have fine-tuned them a little more, but what they make up for with somewhat clunky designs is how expressive they are. Yeah, some poses are reused, but most animated series are animated in 2D with some rigging happening, so expect to see a pose used. I mean, it’s animation. You will have certain poses and mouth movements for certain reactions. Still, it is nice to see an adult animated series have a different visual look, and that they were able to keep the visuals from the creator without too much compromise. Whatever faults or wonkiness I found could be chalked up to a busy pipeline and maybe not enough time to adapt the distinct visuals to a TV production pipeline.\n\nIn terms of the new voice cast, I know a lot of fans were upset that the pilot cast got replaced by celebrities, but that was going to happen if they were going to follow union standards. I mean, even if that same actor’s union is throwing their entire guild under the bus right now. I think the cast is a mixed bag. Some do a good job with their roles and some come off as a little more distracting. Keith David’s performance as Husk grew on me, but I was almost not there for a Keith David performance. It needed to be a bit gruffer, but Husk doesn’t show up a whole lot in the first few episodes, so that could have helped me get used to his voice. Kimiko Glenn as the sadistic Niffty is cute, but it’s not one of her more memorable roles. I think she was more memorable in Dogs in Space and Centaur World on Netflix than here, but it’s also because Niffty doesn’t do a whole lot in these first few episodes, used more as a side gag than a character. Hopefully, we get to see Glenn flex more in the other episodes or the confirmed season two. Stephanie Beatriz is doing her usual tough and cold role that got her known in Brooklyn 99, and I liked her performance as Vaggie. She was the obvious choice if they were going to use big names for these roles, due to how she sounds similar to the pilot’s actor Monica Franco. Amir Talai’s take on Alastar is pretty okay. He doesn’t sound different from the pilot’s actor Edward Bosco and the static voice of Alastar isn’t as grating as you think it would be. Blake Roman does a good job as Angel Dust, though we get that one episode that focuses on the flaws of the character, when the constant sexual innuendos will either be right up your alley or will be grating. His antics got grating, and while the episode that focuses on him and his true dynamic with the porn producer he works with is tragic and full of commentary about abusive relationships, the fact that the show just shoves them back into their dialogue meaning something lewd 80% of the time is groan-inducing. Now, this show is a musical. There are at the very least, two-three musical numbers in each episode, and they are a mixed bag. They range in genre and style of musical numbers, but there are simply way too many of them. They should have refined or cut down how many of them show up in each episode. I wouldn’t be this critical about it, but Centaur World did a much better job balancing out the musical numbers, and when to use them. It’s very distracting when you listen to the Hazbin Hotel song Poison, and while the song is okay in terms of overall quality, shoving a sex joke into a song that’s about abusive and toxic relationships is a bit much. It wrecks the pacing and tone at times, but some other songs fit well enough into the rhythm and tone of the story beat.\n\nSo, what about the story? Well, it’s an adult animated comedy with an overarching season-one plot that progresses the story forward as we watch each episode. Again, I have only seen five episodes of the eight episodes we will be seeing for this first season. It does answer one of my glaring questions about why Heaven wants to keep vaporizing and killing so many of Hell’s residents, but for a lot of the drama and drive to start building up mysteries and backstories for the cast, it still feels like a typical raunchy adult comedy with how many times the characters curse, and how a lot of it can be noisy and violent. Not that I wasn’t expecting that, because adult animation has a lot of the same stigmas that animation aimed at families and kids do. They are just different in how they are trying to cater to teens and young adults. When you get past the familiar spirit of adult animated series, it is trying to add more nuance to a familiar setting where Hell is “good” and Heaven is “bad”. Not that it doesn’t still feel straightforward with Hell being the “good” place, but you won’t get to see it for yourself until you get past episode five where we hopefully will see how Heaven functions, and see if they do tackle the complicated theme of religion and the dynamic of Heaven and Hell. The drama bits don’t fully work, and there are times the writing and pacing of the episodes undermine the deeper parts. I did like the addition of Sir Pentious which helps a little to diversify the cranky squad that we follow. Sadly, he doesn’t do a whole lot after his introduction. What kept my interest was what was going on with the Overlords of Hell, the mystery of finding a dead angel, who killed the angel, the tension between the different Overlords, and finding out more about Alastor. That’s not a great sign that I liked the more background stuff that was going on more than the stuff with the main cast, but that happens sometimes when you create someone like Alastor. At first, I wondered why Alastor was considered this big legendary threat when he was on the same level of zany as everyone else, but they gave the audience a few pieces of backstory that will hopefully result in a more complex character. That is as long as they don’t rewrite, retcon, or pull some contradictions with as many characters as possible with how Helluva Boss has unraveled so far into season two. That’s kind of my worry about Hazbin Hotel since it sometimes feels like both of the creators’ shows want to tackle complicated and somewhat uncomfortable relationships, but then pull back and reverse course to not make their characters completely unlikable. Finding the balance between having likable characters and snark will be important for this show, because there is nothing worse than watching an animated series where the characters have nothing redeemable or entertaining about them. Sometimes the vibe is also trying a bit too hard to be violent and raunchy, but it isn’t as overwhelming as say Paradise PD. The introduction of Adam may very well be the worst character of the show so far, and not in a good way. He is grating, and I never enjoyed any of his scenes. It’s probably the point that he is a conniving dirtbag, but when he’s at 11 at all times, you want to get out of the room. There are a few story beats that also confuse me, like why does Lucifer not know who Alastor is? It is also interesting to see Alastor be not as imposing and fearsome as other Overlords, and on one hand, I do like that, but it does reduce how threatening he is when he can still overpower other Overlords and individuals with ease. Part of what made him mysterious and imposing was how in control of the situation he was in, so seeing him not in control or stressing out when encountering Lucifer and Lucifer himself being an almost pushover and klutzy individual was odd, to say the least. Not that Lucifer didn’t have his moments, but I did leave wondering more about him and his relationship with his wife/Charlie’s mom. I am also hoping we do get to see some kind of progress with them helping folks, because the overall impression so far comes off like the main goal of the hotel becomes an excuse for a location than it being a real part of the main story.\n\nWhile a lot of this editorial was full of more mixed to negative comments, I do want to see how this first season ends. I am trying to be more open than the more intense and vitriolic online response to the leaked episodes, and the fanbase being the worst when anyone has any criticism, legit or not, aimed at the show. It doesn’t help either that any accusations and criticisms get shielded by the die-hard toxic fans of the show and the creatives don’t respectfully talk about the feedback, but get lumped into the bad fans. You are now more mainstream, and people will have access to your shows. Hiding behind fans or ignoring criticism and feedback doesn’t do anything to improve how folks look and take in your art. I want this to do well, and again, who knows how the last three episodes will play out, and I hope they play out well. Depending on the rest of the season, I don’t think I will say this is one of the better shows of the year so far, but hey, we just got started, so let’s hope we have a bountiful and creative year for adult animation. If you like Helluva Boss, then you will probably like this show, but there are a few adult animated series from last year I would recommend checking out more than Hazbin Hotel so far. Who knows, if I can get the remaining episodes of season one, maybe I’ll do a follow-up to this one before and after the season finishes up.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nThe title of this editorial is very hyperbolic and eye-catching. At least, I hope it is, because we need to talk about the indie animation scene. It’s time to give the animation fans or at the very least, a subsection of animation fandom a good hard slap in the form of a wake-up call over some of the most foolish takes about the animation industry that I have seen over the past couple of years. We will break them down via different subject matters and categories of said subject matter. First up, let’s talk about this notion of how indie is the end-all savior of the animation industry.\n\nOver the past few years, we have seen a few indie animated pilots get launched on YouTube and bring along a couple of creative teams, resulting in new pieces of creative art that have taken the animation world by storm. Whether it’s Helluva Boss, The Amazing Digital Circus, Murder Drones, Long Gone Gultch, Godspeed, Cliffside, God’s School, Monkey Wrench, or Lackadaisy, it’s something that has been making splashes across the internet. It’s cool, whether it was through crowdfunding, merchandise sales, or stuff like Patreon to get these experiences crafted, that we are seeing small teams and talented people craft their ideal passion projects. However, like clockwork, animation fans have said some sincerely naive takes about indie animation. They called this recent batch of indie animated pilots and shows the savior of the current animation landscape. They will outshine anything made by studios because they aren’t reliant on studio support to get made. The fans will show up for them and we will enter a new age of animation. Well then, let’s pop that bubble of ignorant bliss, and talk about why that can never be the case.\n\nFirst off, indie animation needs constant and undying support. You can’t just donate once and then call it a day. Do you want to know why so many creatives and teams go to Kickstarter, crowdfunding, or advertise merchandise like crazy? Because that’s how they fund their shows! Without the backing of a major studio or art funds, these projects need a constant flow of cash, because they and everything else costs money. Once that money dries up, well, no more shows, with no way to pay the artists, writers, and so on to craft it. Shows like Helluva Boss and Lackadaisy were able to do these pilots because they built up fanbases over a decade. That is unless they get picked up by a big studio that wants to release them on their channel or streaming service. Indie animation isn’t a small team animating a whole season and then hoping for the best. It’s on an episode-by-episode basis. You won’t be seeing a new episode every week like a normal show or see it all pushed onto Netflix. You will be watching these whenever they get them done or have a studio that helps them out with crafting these episodes. That takes time, which is something y’all don’t seem to understand. You can’t just say I’m going to make an indie animated show if you have no followers. It’s not like we have yet to invent a tree that grows money or checks, so that means you will need to find up to $50K per episode and that’s counting it cheap. Not every indie show can look like a proper TV series when you don’t have a team of 100s working on these projects. Some of these projects are solo ordeals, and some are going to have some rough animation, but if you want high-quality looking stuff, then you need to give them money and time in already not sustainable working conditions. Just because these projects aren’t being backed by major studios or being made by studios, doesn’t mean they are free from the same problems those studios have. There are already stories about people being left out of credits for one famous indie series. We live in a world where not everyone has access to or is part of an art fund or can make a successful Kickstarter. Not everyone can make these shows or pilots for a living. They will be doing it on their own time or when they can until it does become a full-time career.\n\nOh, and you all talk about how supportive you are about the indie animation scene, but you are all not that supportive. It shows in the viewer numbers for the pilots. For example, Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss had double-digit million views. Digital Circus has triple-digit millions. So that must mean the fanbases of indie animation fans want to come in droves over the others, huh? Let’s check those numbers out. Set Sail for Candy? Amazing animation, but it only has 55K views. What about Howling Hoods? 5K views. How about Tales from Scorchwater Valley? 112K views. Monkey Wrench has three episodes out, and they don’t have millions when they absolutely should. Not that some of these aren’t impressive viewership-wise, but there seems to be a bias toward what kind of shows you are all willing to support. You can’t be all for indie animation but only support one show. Yes, we all have our different tastes and not every pilot will take off, but you can’t make an indie animation scene viable when you aren’t willing to watch and root for other very impressive pilots. I enjoy the overall dynamics of Helluva Boss and The Amazing Digital Circus, but they do share similar elements that attract the same folks. It’s understandable for them to do well, but sooner or later, you should want to try something a tad different, like Monkey Wrench. Yes, the polish and quality of the pilots are probably gonna set expectations high, but that’s a topic for another time. You all talk about wanting and acting supportive towards indie animation, but even when you say there is nothing in the big studio scene worth talking about since it’s “all IP and reboots”, you don’t show up for stuff like Scavenger’s Reign or Carol and the End of the World. Y’all showed up for Blue Eye Samurai, which is great, but again, it can’t be just that one show.\n\nAnother thing I have seen is this weird creepy purist viewpoint of so-called fans of indie animation. Folks were wondering why Godspeed, the new pilot from Final Space creator Olan Rogers, wasn’t picking up as much steam as other pilots like Lackadaisy and The Amazing Digital Circus. One brave twit decided to say that Godspeed isn’t gaining traction because he worked in a studio once, a studio by the way, that completely screwed over him and his show. Okay, so you want people to make independent animated series not be from the industry? Don’t you want people who know what they are doing? Sure, some creatives are self-taught, but a lot of the people who make these pilots or series have and will work in the industry. You should want people who know what they are doing to helm these projects. Heck, a lot of game devs that got their start or foot in the door that made some of your favorite indie games worked at other studios before coming together to make stuff like The Banner Saga and Shovel Knight. I love animation, and I have plenty of ideas for shows and films, but I am not someone who would be good at running a show or writing for one until I work on that stuff.\n\nFrom all of this nonsense, you can pinpoint the whole contradicting nature of indie animation fans. You want TV/film-quality animated pilots but want them to still be made by small teams of newcomers to have that official indie feel. You want to be supportive of all indie projects, but don’t show up for all of them and only support certain types of indie shows. You want creatives, but not creatives who have worked in animation or have experience with running a show for some reason. You can’t be picky about your support with indie animation. You can be respectful with your criticism about the quality of the shows and always hope for the best, but you can’t dilly-dally with your support. You also can’t be mad about the fact that these teams need to keep plugging merchandise, their Patreon, or use crowdfunding or if need be, brand deals and sponsorships. Making money strictly from YouTube is not possible anymore. Once again, I highly recommend following the Monkey Wrench creator’s Twitter, since they are very open about the cost of making their show.\n\nOf course, the teams making these shows need to be real with what they can do and be open to feedback. Don’t just make a show because it’s popular right now. Like the indie game scene, you have to be real about the fact that not every indie project is going to take off as hard as some of the shows have. Make a pilot or show that you want to make. Don’t try to copy what’s popular because we already have that show, and unless you can put a creative spin on the setting or premise, then try making a show or craft a setting we haven’t seen yet in the indie animation scene. Since the indie animation scene is built entirely on feedback, of course, you shouldn’t give the toxic side of your fanbase the time of day, but if people have legit criticisms of how you have handled the story, the character arcs, or how you have changed course with how your characters have shifted, then you have to start listening and trying to make as many improvements as you can.\n\nNow, with all this said, there is something that needs to be made clear about all of this. Even with all of these fixes and ideals that I have about what makes a healthy indie animation scene, the only way you can make the indie animation scene a substantial way to make a living off of animation, then you need to fix the problems that are within the overall animation and entertainment industry. With the recent actors and writers strike, this year, the animation guild is going to be renegotiating their terms and deals to push back against the industry wanting to automatize their roles with AI instead of doing something more useful, like replacing useless CEOs. They need the constant support that you showed the writers and actors because once we fix the situation with the main studio side of animation, we should see better pay, creators keeping the rights to their shows/pilots, pushing toxic individuals out of the industry, better working conditions, more diverse stories, more variety in visuals, and so on. The roots of all the problems we see in animation can be tied back to how the industry has mistreated its creatives and running away to “go indie” won’t solve anything. You have to stand your ground and push back against the higher-ups ruining everything for everyone else. Once that happens, then we can also hopefully fight for more art funds/grants for small teams to craft shorts, pilots, and you get the idea. Having a government that supports the arts would be fantastic.\n\nI originally came into this editorial wanting to be more critical and enraged at the udder ignorance about folks who have constantly said “Just go indie. Indie is the future. Nothing good is coming out of the studio work and indie is pure”. You can be optimistic about the indie scene, but you have to set your expectations realistically. Indie animation can not save an industry and it’s irresponsible for content creators in the animation scene and fans of animation to keep parroting that it’s the best alternative to working in the world of animation. There are ways to make it work, but it isn’t as easy as counting to 3 or just dropping everything to make an indie series or pilot. There is a way to make indie animation viable, but it needs to begin with making the studio animation scene healthy from the ground up. Sorry to burst some bubbles and dreams, but indie can’t be the savior of the animation industry. That doesn’t mean you can’t aim to make your film, short, pilot, and what have you. You simply need to know what you are getting into.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nHey, everyone, I had to break this up into two parts because tackling one editorial that was going to be eight pages long would have been a lot for my readers, so if you have yet to see part 1, then go to this link and you will find it there. Thank you and enjoy the rest of this breakdown and observation about the Fall 2023 Anime Season!\n\nRomance\n\nAnime talked about in this category:\n\nA Girl and Her Guard Dog (Crunchyroll), I’m Giving the Disgraced Noble Lady I Rescued a Crash Course in Naughtiness (Crunchyroll), Our Dating Story (Crunchyroll), The 100 Girlfriends Who Really Really Really Really Really Love You (Crunchyroll).\n\nOverall Impressions: It must be tough to make a good romance anime, because you either have authors that haven’t had a relationship experience or had proper relationship/dating experience, or you get a few chaotic individuals who are either tired of romcom or harem anime tropes, and just run wild and pulling the lever to see what happens with it. A Girl and Her Guard Dog is yet another creepy as-hell age-gap romance, and one where the romance isn’t all that great or healthy. Yes, some authors use stories to explore taboo subject matters, but when it’s between a 15-year-old girl and a 26-year-old man who has known her since she was a toddler, then that becomes a problem. It’s by far and away the worst show of the season, despite it trying to make it quirky and charming when it feels like the story has to twist itself into pretzels to make the story work. Exploring taboo subject matters isn’t forbidden, but if you are going to, you have to tackle it in a way that isn’t an adult man who is aging into 30 telling the teenager that she grew into the body type "
