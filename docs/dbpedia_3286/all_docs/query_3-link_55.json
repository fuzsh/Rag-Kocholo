        "text": "It's difficult to make a good horror film these days and we know it. The genre has situated itself in retrospective feedback loops of the sequel, the prequel the remake as well as the ironic tragic replay of itself as farce, where horror makes its own antirealist wink into the blood spattered lens and knows the condition of its own constraint to horror. 1 In this sense what we expect from horror and what we often get are very different. Horror promises the experience of the ungrounding of certain norms, the kind of fear that we might be unprepared for, and the kind of experience that comes from nowhere. But more often than not we see horror instead as a labour upon the recuperation of itself as a set of norms, habits and styles reinstated ironically as a claim to the meta-genre of new transgressions within the genre. Films like Hostel, (2005 dir. Eli Roth), extrapolate this dance of horror's meta-genre. Hostel foregrounds the connections between knowledge and money/power, entangling these discourses in the central narrative framework. Here, the constraints of the horror genre are made equivalent to the administration of neo-liberal economies, where the film features various modes of torture as artistic spectacle that is paid for in full by rich masochists. The victims of such terror are victims only because they are naively unaware of the traditional allegories of the horror genre: Don't trust anyone, don't go backpacking in Eastern Europe, don't go out alone at night, don't be a slut, etc. Horror, in the film Hostel is writ as a knowledge based and fiscal centered economy. For the victims this is marked as lack. They meet death precisely because they have not watched enough horror movies. For the masochistic authors of the terror featured 1 Franchises such as Scary Movie (2000, dir. Keenan Ivory Wayans, Dimension Films) exemplify this genre of meta-horror, where the tropes of various horror films and their allegorical content such as the 'easy' girl gets it first, are culled from the history of the genre and replayed or re-enacted as another self-conscious representational form.\n\nThe aim of this study is to understand the role of female protagonists in serial killer movies.This dissertation analyzes In the Cut (Campion, 2003), Taking Lives (Caruso, 2004) and MaryReilly (Frears, 1996) as an example of films which have a specific common quality. Startingwith The Silence of the Lambs (Demme, 1991), there has been a substantial increase in thenumber of films that tell the story of male serial killers who are investigated by females. Filmswith same identical properties; such as Twisted (Kaufman, 2004), Copycat (Amiel, 1999),1996), Kiss the Girls (Fleder, 1997), Murder by Numbers (Schroeder, 2002), Tesis(Amenábar, 1996) and The Bone Collector (Noyce, 1999); followed The Silence of the Lambs.All These films hold the essential properties of serial killer films that have femaleprotagonists who have a sexual relationship with the killer and, at the end, overcome thekiller. This female is similar to Final Girls whom Clover has theorized while examiningslasher films. Therefore this dissertation first analyzes the basic elements of horror films, andthen it examines a new type of serial killer films with psychoanalytic theories and compares itto Clover’s slasher films. Starting with general aspects of horror films, it focuses on slasherfilms - a subgenre of horror films. Afterwards, it goes on to compare In the Cut (Campion,2003), Taking Lives (Caruso, 2004) and Mary Reilly (Frears, 1996) with slasher films.Although these films differ in many aspects, they still share common qualities. This studyattempts to analyze these common qualities that can be traced back to slasher films. In theend, having discussed how slasher films have evolved into serial killer films with femalevictim-heroes, this thesis continues discussing the role of the female victim-heropsychoanalytically by studying Clover’s theories of identification and Final Girls Bu çalısmanın amacı seri katil filmlerindeki kadın kahramanların rolünü anlamaktır. Bu tezbelli ortak özellikler tasıyan In the Cut (Campion, 2003), Taking Lives (Caruso, 2004) veMary Reilly (Frears, 1996) adlı filmleri analiz ediyor. The Silence of the Lambs (Demme,1991) filmiyle birlikte seri katilleri arastıran kadın kahramanların oldugu filmlerin sayısındabir yükselme oldu. Aynı temel özellikleri tasıyan Twisted (Kaufman, 2004), Copycat (Amiel,1999), Kiss the Girls (Fleder, 1997), Murder by Numbers (Schroeder, 2002), Tesis(Amenábar, 1996) ve The Bone Collector (Noyce, 1999) The Silence of the Lambs’ı takip etti.Bütün bu filmler, seri katille cinsel iliskiye giren ve filmin sonunda onları alt eden kadınkahramanların oldugu seri katil filmlerinin temel özelliklerini tasıyorlar. Bu kadın tipi,Clover’ın slasher filmleri incelerken öne sürdügü Final Girl tipine benzemektedir. Bu sebeple,bu tez, öncelikle, korku filmlerinin temel özelliklerini inceliyor, ardından da yeni bir seri katilfilmleri türünü psikanalitik teorilerle analiz ediyor ve bu filmleri Clover’ın slasher filmleriylekarsılastırıyor. Korku filmlerinin genel özelliklerini tanımlamakla basladıktan sonra korkujanrının bir alt janrı olan slasher filmlere odaklanıyor. Ardından da In the Cut (Campion,2003), Taking Lives (Caruso, 2004) ve Mary Reilly (Frears, 1996) filmlerini slasher filmlerlekarsılastırıyor. Bu filmler bazı karakteristikleri açısından farklı olsalar da ortak özellikleri agırbasıyor. Bu çalısma bu ortak özellikleri analiz ediyor ve onların kökenini slasher filmleredayandırıyor. Bu tez kadın kurban-kahramanların yer aldıgı seri katil filmlerinin slasherfilmlerinin yeniden biçimlenmis halleri oldugunu kanıtlamaya çalıstıktan sonra, bufilmlerdeki kadın kurban-kahramanların rollerini psikanalatik açıdan tartısıyor. Bunun için deClover’ın “identification” ve Final Girl teorilerini inceliyor."
