Directed by multiple Oscar winner Robert Wise (WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC) from a screenplay by Edmund H. North (PATTON), the film features an outstanding experimental score by Bernard Herman (PSYCHO, TAXI DRIVER), a serious-minded approach, compelling performances from an iconic cast, and the quasi-fascist robot enforcer, Gort!\n\nPolite notice: We are showing THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL with English subtitles from the best available digital source. All ATOMIC ORIGINS films will screen with an introduction, intermission, spot quiz, and subtitles/captions (where possible!). Tickets £8 (£5 for Picturehouse members). Adults 18+ only."
