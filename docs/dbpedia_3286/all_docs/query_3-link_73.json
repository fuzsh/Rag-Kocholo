category in the publishing field, attaining a level of respect and permanence in academia previously held by their counterparts in prose. Salem Press’s Critical Survey of Graphic Novels series aims to collect the preeminent graphic novels and core comics series that form today’s canon for academic coursework and library collection development, offering clear, concise, and accessible analysis of not only the historic and current landscape of the interdisciplinary medium and its consumption but also the wide range of genres, themes, devices, and techniques that the graphic novel medium encompasses. The combination of visual images and text, the emphasis of art over written description, the coupling of mature themes with the comic form—these elements appeal to the graphic novel enthusiast but remain a source of reluctance to other readers. Designed for both popular and scholarly arenas and collections, the series provides unique insight and analysis into the most influential and widely-read graphic novels, with an emphasis on establishing the medium as an important academic discipline. We hope researchers and the common reader alike will gain a deeper understanding of these works, as the literary nature is presented in critical format by leading writers in the field of study. Manga is the third title of the Critical Survey of Graphic Novels series, in conjunction with Heroes and Superheroes; Independents and Underground Classics; and History, Theme, and Technique. This title collects more than sixty-five of the most popular and studied manga graphic novels, ranging from metaseries to stand-alone books. A recent influx of translated Japanese manga into the American market has sparked a greater interest in foreign-language traditions and long-form comics. The current volume provides detailed insight into and analyses of the major works that have helped to define the manga medium, focusing on translated works that have been particularly influential in the development of the manga tradition. Stories have been compiled and dissected to provide viewpoints that are easily missed during initial readings.\n\nScope and Coverage This single-volume set covers over sixty-five wellregarded works of the manga medium, summarizing plots and analyzing the works in terms of their literary integrity and overall contribution to the graphic novel landscape. Often defined by such characteristics as stylized line work, cultural-specific narratives, and compelling storytelling that often stand in contrast to the character-centric framework of American comics, manga nonetheless encompasses a broad range of genres and subgenres. Researchers will gain a better understanding of the latter, which, in the manga tradition, is represented by a wide spectrum that includes josei manga, which targets a mature female audience; shoujo-ai manga, which focuses on the spiritual, sexual, or emotional aspects of relationships; shōnen-ai, manga created by female authors that focuses on homoerotic or homoromantic male relationships; and kodomo manga, created exclusively for a young audience. In writing these essays, contributors worked from original sources, providing new criticism and content aimed at deconstructing both centuries-old themes and concepts as well as nontraditional genres and styles, and portraying the graphic novel as literature. To that end, essays look beyond the popular-culture aspects of the medium to show the wide range of literary devices and overarching themes and styles used to convey beliefs and conflicts. Furthermore, critical attention was paid to panel selection and relevancy and to a particular work’s influence on the creators’ careers, other graphic novels, or literature as a whole. The graphic novels field is defined by tremendous complexity; to that end, many important works and creators in the manga medium have been omitted. Finally, while the series has an international scope, attention has been focused on translated works that have been influential in the development of a specific graphic novel tradition. Organization and Format The essays in Manga appear alphabetically and are approximately 3 to 4 pages in length. Each essay is heavily formatted and begins with full ready-reference top matter that includes the primary author or authors,\n\nvii\n\nPublisher’s Note\n\nillustrators, and other artists who contributed to the work, and the first serial and book publication. This is followed by the main text, which is divided into “Publication History,” “Plot,” “Volumes,” “Characters,” “Style,” “Themes,” and “Impact.” A list of adaptations of the graphic novel into film and television are also noted, and a user-friendly bibliography completes the essay. Cross-references direct readers to related topics, and further reading suggestions accompany all articles. Publication History presents an overview of the work’s origin and publication chronology. Specifically, dates of first serial publication, first book publication, and first translation into English are provided. Many graphic novels were first serialized in comic book form, often as a limited series, and were later collected or republished in book format, while other graphic novels were conceptualized as novelistic works. In addition, details about the significant awards and honors won by each work are listed. Plot provides an in-depth synopsis of the main story progression and other story arcs. As an aid to students, this section focuses on the most critically important plot turns in the series or work and why these were important. Where applicable, Volumes orients the reader or researcher to the accepted reading order of the work. For series, it lists individual volumes or collections, often comprising different story arcs. The year when each collection was published is provided. Also identified are the issues that were collected within a volume, a synopsis of the volume’s main focus, and its significance within the entire collection. Characters presents detailed descriptions of major characters in the story, beginning with the main protagonists and antagonists. The section discusses physical descriptions, character traits and significant characteristics, the character’s relationship with others, and the primary role a character plays in advancing the plot of the work or series. To aid readers, descriptions include “also known as” names and monikers. Style provides analysis of the work’s visual content, especially as it relates to characterization, plot, and mood; discussion of any changes in style as the story progresses; and the use of elements and devices such as dialogue, captions, panels, penciling, inking, and backgrounds. Themes identifies the central themes in the work, how they are expressed—for example, through plot or viii\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels\n\nlayout—and how they relate to characterization and style. It also discusses, when applicable, whether a major thematic point is a chronicle of the author’s personal development, or a projection of it, and how this may resonate with readers. Impact covers the work’s influence on the creators’ careers, publishing houses, the medium of graphic novels itself, and literature in general. The section also analyzes the impact of the creation of new characters or series. Of focus is the critical reception of the work or series and whether it was atypical for its historical period. Bibliography lists secondary print sources for further study and examination, annotated to assist readers in evaluating focus and usefulness. Appendixes and Other Special Features Special features help to further distinguish this reference series from other works on graphic novels. These include a general bibliography as well as a timeline discussing significant events and influential graphic novel predecessors spanning the ancient world, when woodblock printing was first brought to Japan from China, through the first use of the term “manga” in the early 1800s to the present. Another key feature of the essays in this publication are biographical sidebars on authors, illustrators, and significant publications related to the works profiled. Additionally, the single-volume set features full-page images and panels from the actual works. Four indexes round out the set, illustrating the breadth of the reference work’s coverage: Works by Publisher, Works by Author, Works by Artist, and a subject index. Acknowledgments Many hands went into the creation of this work, and Salem Press is grateful for the effort of all involved. This includes the original contributors of these essays, whose names can be found at the end of each essay and also found in the “Contributor List” that follows the Introduction. Special mention must be paid to Marc Weidenbaum, who penned the introduction and lent his expertise to many of the volume’s supplemental and complimentary materials, including the sidebars. Weidenbaum is former Editor in Chief of the American edition of Shōnen Jump, the bestselling manga magazine in Japan. He was Vice President of Magazines, Online, and Original Comics at Viz Media, which published the American Shōnen Jump. Comics he\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels\n\nedited have appeared in books by Jessica Abel, Justin Green, Carol Swain, and Adrian Tomine, among others. He also introduced and edited the comics in Pulse! and Classical Pulse!, which were published by Tower Records, and was a contributor to the book 1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die. Special mention must also be paid to Lisa Schimmer, who played an invaluable role in shaping some of the reference content. Finally, we are indebted to our editors, Bart Beaty, Professor of English at the University of Calgary, and Stephen Weiner, Director of Maynard Public Library in Maynard, Massachusetts, for their advice in selecting works and their writing contributions. Both are\n\nPublisher’s Note\n\npublished in the field of comics and graphic novels studies. Beaty is the author of Fredric Wertham and the Critique of Mass Culture, Unpopular Culture: Transforming the European Comic Book in the 1990s, and David Cronenberg’s “A History of Violence.” Weiner is the author or co-author of The 101 Best Graphic Novels, Faster than a Speeding Bullet: The Rise of the Graphic Novel, The Hellboy Companion, The Will Eisner Companion, and Using Graphic Novels in the Classroom. Their efforts in making this resource a comprehensive and indispensible tool for students, researchers, and general readers alike is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nix\n\nIntroduction Manga is as indigenous to Japan as the telenovela is to Latin America and as jazz is to the United States. Which is to say, while there are things in other countries that seem to resemble manga — let’s call them “comics” — the process of sorting out just how unlike manga these other mediums are can be informative, enlightening, even enthralling. Cultural parallels are useful as a point of comparison. Soap operas remain a popular form of serialized television throughout the world, yet none follow the norms of the telenovela, whether in regard to received notions of story structure or consensual appreciation of cultural impact. And while there is a rich tradition of modal music around the world that comingles appropriation, group improvisation, and composition, no form has the specific literature, the accrued techniques, and the internal conflict of jazz. Similarly, storytelling that combines concise text with static images in a sequential format is present around the globe, from the funny pages of American newspapers to the bandes dessinées of francophone culture. But no nation at the start of the third millennium can compare with Japan in terms of the extent to which sequential art infiltrates and informs the everyday life of the populace. This is true even as manga faces, in its native land, significant and long-running declines. To speak of manga is not to speak of a “genre” or even a “medium.” It is to speak of a cultural cycle — in fact, of several interrelated and overlapping cultural cycles. First, there is the publication cycle. The majority of manga appears initially in thick, inexpensively printed anthologies that are published in serial form, often weekly, generally monthly. The best known of these magazines outside of Japan, titled Weekly Shōnen Jump, is also the best selling inside Japan. Home to Dragon Ball, Naruto, and Slam Dunk, among many other series, the magazine sold upwards of six million copies each week at its height in the mid-1990’s—and that’s based entirely on newsstand sales. (Full disclosure: I am a former editor-in-chief of the magazine’s American edition, which was published from 2002 through 2012, when it moved online.) The various series in these anthology magazines are then collected into paperbacks, called tankōbon, that\n\ncollect around a dozen or so chapters in one volume. As of this writing, for example, the magazine Big Comic’s series Golgo 13, which debuted in 1969 and continues to be published monthly, has seen at least 160 sequential tankōbon volumes, which excludes art books, anime, video games, and assorted other merchandise. A successful manga in Japan isn’t merely the launching pad for a franchise—it is the fuel on which the country’s cultural engine runs. Second, there is the participation cycle. Before the advent of video gaming, it was said there were two things most teenage boys in Japan wanted to do professionally: play baseball and create manga. While the tantalizing, brass-ring cultural status of manga may be diminishing slowly, the medium remains part of the everyday imagination of Japanese youth. Manga creators are often drafted, like basketball players, right out of high school—they come from the manga magazines’ readership, brought to the attention of manga editors through regular drawing and storytelling competitions. Manga magazines, of which there are dozens upon dozens, compete not just with each other, but also internally; each week and month, some series will be dropped out and others added, based on reader opinion as gauged through fast-response polling. To an extent, the route from reader to manga creator, along with the status of reader-as-judge, is an illusion intended to enhance the bond between readers and the manga industry. But even allowing for a certain amount of marketing showmanship, the strategy’s effectiveness is predicated on an already existing and deep cultural permeation. The third cycle of manga is the consumption cycle. Manga entices the young and entertains the elderly and is part of mainstream Japanese life in between. There is manga for every stage of life, from toddlers through the standard peer groups associated with comics (teenage, early adulthood), up through professional life, and on to retirement. Abroad, much is made of pornography and manga (from tentacles to pedophilia), but the root of that association has less to do with an inherently sexualized medium than it does with a publishing realm in which sex is simply one of countless subjects. There is biography manga, romance manga, educational manga, business manga, and action manga. And there is populist manga and literary manga—the former arriving xi\n\nIntroduction\n\nwith the full intent to shortly thereafter have a second life as fish wrap, and the latter part of a vibrant and avant-garde exploratory art. That is manga inside Japan. To read manga outside Japan involves several acts of distancing. There is the translation process, in which jokes and other references are transformed with the foreign reader in mind. There is the time lag, in which cultural events to which a specific manga chapter was timed (political, seasonal) are severed and forgotten. And foremost there is, among numerous additional aspects, the general absence of the weekly/monthly serial experience—the act of consuming in relative sync with a sizable population of fellow readers over the extended period of a given manga’s run. Manga outside Japan is generally consumed in paperback tankōbon collections reprinted years if not decades after their original publication; removed from its\n\nxii\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels\n\ninitial, dynamic, magazine-based publication cycle, manga in translated paperbacks can collectively appear stolid and cumbersome. The result is that manga is seen, not entirely incorrectly, as so massive that it confounds, eludes, and overwhelms potential new readers. (Only the online manga-reading experience approaches the aura and the momentum of the indigenous Japanese magazine experience, and that online activity is largely the province of the thriving amateur translation, or “scanlation,” community.) Manga’s immensity can be unwieldy. It’s essential to keep in mind that Comiket, the annual Japanese convention for self-published (or dōjinshi) comics, attracts upwards of half a million attendees—four times the audience of the preeminent American comics convention, San Diego Comic-Con. The challenge when approaching manga is to see that immensity as evidence of cultural and literary wealth, and not as a warning sign of an impenetrable world.\n\nContributor List Ted Anderson Golden Valley, MN\n\nRobert Greenberger Fairfield, CT\n\nJeremy R.

Tezuka decided to combine the idea with a story about the famous World War II (1939-1945) spy Richard Sorge, with whom he was fascinated. The story grew into an epic series that spans many years and involves different historical and fictional figures. The story began running in the weekly political magazine Shukan Bunshun in 1983, but Tezuka’s deteriorating health (he received a treatment for hepatitis while working on the series) meant some elements were cut from the story; these were restored in the collected edition. The collected edition was translated to English in 1995 and became the first work by Tezuka to have an American edition. Plot The story is set in Berlin in 1936. Sohei Toge, a Japanese reporter covering the Olympic Games, schedules a meeting with his brother, a foreign-exchange student who lives in the city. Upon arriving at his brother’s apartment, Toge discovers that his brother has been murdered and that certain elements of the crime bear disturbing similarities to the murder of a popular geisha, a crime he covered in Japan several months be-\n\nfore. His investigations into the matter get him into trouble with the oppressive authorities in Nazi Germany and his native Japan. Toge’s story intertwines with the story of two people named Adolf: the first, Adolf Kamil, is the son of a Jewish family of refugees who fled Germany and settled in the Japanese city of Kobe; the other, Adolf Kaufman, is the son of a senior Nazi official who also lives in the city. The two boys become friends after being harassed by local Japanese children for their foreign look, but their friendship turns into bitter hatred as the years pass and the war progresses; their differences become irreconcilable, and both of them fall in love with the same girl. Their rivalry, stretching throughout the war and beyond, is linked to the murder of Toge’s brother by a mysterious package of documents, which carries a secret that could lead to the downfall of the story’s third Adolf, the infamous tyrant Hitler, as the documents prove that he is of Jewish ancestry. Volumes • Adolf: A Tale of the Twentieth Century (1995). Covers Sohei Toge’s investigation in Berlin and the tale of friendship between the two Adolfs. • Adolf: An Exile in Japan (1996). Toge returns to Japan, learns of the documents, and is harassed by the police. Kaufman is sent to the Hitler Youth boarding school in Berlin and becomes a devoted Nazi. • Adolf: The Half-Aryan (1996). The quest for the documents continues, and things get complicated for the two Adolfs when they both fall in love with a beautiful Jewish girl. • Adolf: Days of Infamy (1996). Kamil and Toge believe that they have found a trustworthy party 1\n\nAdolf to deliver the documents to when they make contact with a ring of communist spies in Japan; Kaufman is sent to Japan to retrieve the documents at any cost. • 1945 and All That Remains (1996). Kamil and Kaufman, now bitter enemies, clash repeatedly, first as the war draws to a close and later against the backdrop of the Arab-Israeli conflict, until their final confrontation. Characters • Sohei Toge, a Japanese journalist, is one of the series’ protagonists and also serves as the story’s narrator. A capable, well-built man with a strong sense of justice, Toge’s involvement in the affairs described in the series comes not only from his wish to avenge his brother’s death but also from his disgust with the oppressive, hateful regimes of both Nazi Germany and his own country. • Adolf Kamil is a boy from a family of German Jewish refugees who settled in Kobe. In some ways, he is a younger version of Toge: physically strong, resourceful, kind, and altruistic; also, he bears deep hatred toward Nazi Germany and its leader. However, he is frustrated by the Jews’ helplessness and admires the nationalistic and militaristic character of imperial Japan, believing that the Jews should follow the same example. • Adolf Kaufman, the son of high-ranking Nazi official and a Japanese woman, starts the series as an innocent boy who befriends Kamil. As he is absorbed deeper into life in Nazi Germany, he becomes a stronger and more confident person but also a cunning one, capable of almost psychotic violence. • Acetylene Lampe is an official with the German secret police. He is a narrow-faced, bespectacled sadist, and in charge of the investigation of the documents affair. • Akabane is an officer with the Japanese secret police. A sadist much like Lampe, he is a short, unshaven bully. He becomes obsessed with tracking the documents, suspecting they are a part of communist political activity. 2\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels\n\n• Elisa Gutheimer is a young, pretty brunet Jewish\n\ngirl, with whom Kaufman falls in love while persecuting her family in Berlin. To save her life, Kaufman sends Gutheimer to Japan, where she and Kamil fall in love. • Miss Ogi was the schoolteacher for both Toge’s brother and Kamil. She is described as a lean, middle-aged woman, though she is drawn as a much younger person (a rather attractive woman in her thirties). She is a communist and pacifist political activist and aids Toge in his quest for the documents. • Yoshio Honda is the son of a decorated colonel in the Japanese army; he hates his father and the Japanese imperialist ideology for which he stands. He is physically well built, with a military haircut, though his facial expression always seems to reflect anger and disdain. He works for the communist spy ring to which Toge and Kamil attempt to deliver the documents. • Adolf Hitler, the infamous Nazi German dictator, is often portrayed in the series as a hysterical, grotesque figure who accompanies his speeches with exaggerated gestures. His characterization poses the question of why an entire nation chose to follow such a person to its doom. The secret of Hitler’s ancestry hidden in the documents is the driving force of the series’ plot. Artistic Style Adolf is perhaps the most serious and realistic series in Tezuka’s enormous body of work; its artistic style represents something of a departure from Tezuka’s usual cartoony character designs and gag-ridden action drawings. The male protagonists, in particular, could pass for protagonists in an American comic book: tall, strong, realistically drawn “men of action” set to deal with the cruelty of the modern world. Female characters retain some of the cute appearances typical of Tezuka’s other works but still look more like stars in classic Hollywood cinema than figures in the Walt Disney Productions and Fleischer Studios cartoons admired and imitated by Tezuka in other works. Cartoony design and gags are mostly reserved for the minor antagonistic characters; the German investi-\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels gator Lampe and the Japanese policeman Akabane, for example, are notable for being the only two characters in the series from Tezuka’s “star system” of regular characters (the two characters often appear as villains in Tezuka’s works). Other antagonistic characters, notably Hitler, also are drawn in a cartoony style, portraying their evil as grotesque, and linking this evil to human stupidity. Interestingly, though most characters, even Japanese characters, feature a Western appearance (not particularly unusual in Tezuka’s work), some minor Asian characters, especially of the questionable type (a Chinese spy or a Japanese smuggler), feature an appearance that could be seen as stereotypically offensive had they not been drawn by an Asian artist. The detailed, well-researched background drawings that take readers from Germany to Japan and the Middle East further reflect the series’ realistic tone. Themes The life of Tezuka, Japan’s “God of Comics,” is indeed a “tale of the twentieth century,” much like the title of the first volume in Adolf. Born in 1928, Tezuka grew up as Japan became a military dictatorship that committed atrocious crimes against its neighbors and suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Allied forces, falling into ruin and poverty after the war. Tezuka was alive during Japan’s amazing recovery, in which the country became an economic superpower. He sensed that this new status led to political and environmental corruption and made Japan a pawn for the Americans in the struggle against the Soviet Union, whose early stages of collapse he saw before his death in 1989. Though Tezuka hardly endorsed communism, a degree of sympathy for Japanese communists during the war years can be felt in some of the series’ chapters. All of this led Tezuka to develop a deep suspicion of nationalism, the military, and any ideology that pretended to offer quick solutions to humanity’s problems. The Jewish people, who for generations lacked their own national identity or country, seem to have fascinated Tezuka; he appears to have found this existence an ideal alternative to the ideologies that led to the great tragedies of the twentieth century. In a particularly brave move, Tezuka drew parallels between the Nazi regime in Germany and the Japanese regime\n\nAdolf during World War II and the crimes against humanity committed by both. However, he lets the Japanese population off the hook somewhat, claiming that many were ignorant of the crimes committed in their name. The final confrontation between the two Adolfs— one an Israeli soldier and the other fighting alongside the Palestinians—demonstrates how the tragic cycle continues well into the future. The Jews have adopted the nationalistic, militant sentiment that previously led to their own persecution, and the Palestinians aspire toward the realization of the very same sentiment. Impact Though one of Tezuka’s less influential works, produced in a decade when dealing with serious political and historical issues in manga was nothing unusual, Adolf is nonetheless regarded as one of the artist’s most compelling and well-plotted narratives. The collected edition of the series was among the first manga to be featured in the literature rather than comic book section of Japanese bookstores. Naoki Urasawa’s acclaimed series Monster (19942001) appears to have borrowed many elements from Adolf, including the story of a Japanese protagonist in Germany and a murder mystery set against the political backdrop of changing times. In 1995, Adolf became the first series by Tezuka to be published in an American edition, and though it was not an instant success, many other titles by the author would follow, including those of a less commercial variety, such as Buddha and MW.

Because of the success of the series Kodansha began to publish the magazine installments in paperback collections in 1984. With the Akira series running strong, the Epic Comics division of Marvel Comics in the United States began publication of the Akira series in booklets of sixtyeight pages each in 1988. This first American edition was based on Kodansha’s ongoing paperback collections of the series. Japanese manga are read from the top right to the bottom left of the page and are bound on the right side. The American editors converted this to the familiar Western pattern of top left to bottom right by mirroring, or “flipping,” the pages and binding the comic books on the left. Even though Otomo had colored only the few initial pages of each Kodansha paperback collection, the first American edition was completely computer colored by Steve Oliff, whom Otomo chose for this role. Otomo finished the last of the 120 magazine installments of Akira in the June 25, 1990, issue of Yangu Magajin. However, he agonized over retouching his work for the paperback Kodansha collections. It took nearly three years to complete Akira, with the appearance of Volume 6 in this format on March 23, 1993. As the American edition was based on these collections, Epic Comics issued\n\nThe Akira series, one of the earliest manga series to arrive in the United States, is collected into six volumes. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nthe much-delayed finale of its thirty-eight issues of the colorized Akira in 1995. Marvel Comics began to publish both paperback and hardback collections of these issues. However, only ten of the thirteen planned paperback collections were published from 1990 to 1993, and only five of the six hardback limited editions were published. This left Akira unfinished in this publication run. From December, 2000, to March, 2002, Dark Horse Comics published Akira in six black-and-white volumes with only the initial pages in color, as in the Japanese collections. This edition still flipped the manga to conform to Western reading habits. From October, 2009, to April, 2011, Kodansha published an American edition of Akira in six volumes that followed the earlier 5\n\n​Akira​ Dark Horse Comics version, which followed closely the original Japanese six-volume collection of the Akira magazine installments and is discussed below. In addition to the American editions, Akira has been published in French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Polish, and Flemish. Plot At age twenty-six, Katsuhiro Otomo launched Akira by building on the success of his previous manga work, particularly Domu (2001). Akira was created for the same young male Japanese readership as Domu. Otomo set Akira in the postapocalyptic NeoTokyo of 2030. Thirty-eight years after an unexplained explosion destroyed the original Tokyo at 2:17 p.m. on December 6, 1992, and triggered World War III, Neo-Tokyo sits atop an artificial island in Tokyo Bay. Akira rapidly launches its story of two teenage friends, Shotaro Kaneda and his sidekick Tetsuo Shima, who become bitter enemies when Tetsuo acquires vast psychic powers. Defying authorities, as is their habit, Kaneda’s gang of teenagers races futuristic motorcycles and breaks through the dilapidated barrier on the bridge that connects Neo-Tokyo to the ruins of the original city. On their return, Tetsuo nearly runs over a ghostly boy, who has the facial features of an old man and is later revealed to be Takashi. Takashi is part of a group of psychics who as children were subjected to secret government experimentation. This gave them various paranormal powers but trapped them in their child’s bodies while aging their faces. Tetsuo is injured when Takashi makes his motorcycle explode before he teleports from the scene. Suddenly, the military appears, and Tetsuo is taken to a hospital. With Tetsuo away, Kaneda gets involved with a mysterious teenage girl, Kei. She belongs to a violent, secret antigovernment group that includes her older brother Ryu and Nezu, a member of parliament. They encounter Takashi again in the streets of Neo-Tokyo just as a special military unit, led by Colonel Shikishima, tries to capture him. This leads to much violence triggered by Takashi’s paranormal powers and the fight between Shikishima’s troops and the antigovernment forces. 6\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels Tetsuo leaves the hospital, and his new psychic powers have changed him into Kaneda’s bitter enemy. He teams up with a rival gang and seeks to kill Kaneda. The price for Tetsuo’s powers, as for the child-bodied psychics, is a new dependence on a powerful drug to which only the Colonel has access. As a result, the Colonel can take Tetsuo, as well as Kaneda and Kei, into custody. The Colonel reveals that Tokyo’s destruction was caused by the powers of a child psychic called Akira. Akira is kept in a cryogenic chamber in cold stasis and guarded by the Colonel. The bitter fight between Tetsuo, Kaneda, and Kei reaches a new dimension when Tetsuo decides to release Akira from his cold chamber. He succeeds in awakening Akira, who looks and acts like a rather passive boy, but Kaneda and Kei snatch Akira from Tetsuo’s hands. Soon different forces led by the Colonel, an old woman psychic called Lady Miyako, and the rebels under Nezu all chase after Akira and battle one another violently. When Nezu catches up with Akira, he shoots at him but kills Takashi instead. This shocks Akira into releasing a telekinetic shockwave that destroys NeoTokyo in much the same style of his earlier destruction of Tokyo. Tetsuo suddenly appears and leads away Akira. In the ruins of Neo-Tokyo, the battles between the rival factions resume. Tetsuo sets up Akira as boy emperor for the Great Tokyo Empire and acts as his prime minister. Kei and the Colonel support Lady Miyako, while the Americans enter the scene through their spy, Japanese American George Yamada. At the climax of Tetsuo’s attack on Lady Miyako’s temple, the Colonel fires a powerful laser gun at Tetsuo but destroys only one of his arms. Kaneda, presumed dead, reappears and rejoins the anti-Tetsuo alliance. Worried about the goings-on in Neo-Tokyo, the Americans and Russians send a joint force of aircraft carriers to the region. Determined to kill Tetsuo, the foreigners consider using biological weapons to kill all city dwellers. Tetsuo teleports to the lead aircraft carrier and demonstrates his power by destroying fighter jets before disappearing. More fighting ensues among Tetsuo and his Japanese and foreign opponents. Tetsuo destroys foreign battleships and\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels even launches a nuclear weapon. He survives being hit by a missile that is psychically guided by Lady Miyako. While Kaneda and Tetsuo fight a fierce battle at the Olympic stadium, the American-led foreign forces seek to complete the destruction of Neo-Tokyo with a laser satellite called FLOYD. Tetsuo yanks FLOYD out of its orbit. Employing her powers as psychic medium, Kei uses the combined psychic forces of the child-bodied psychics to eliminate Tetsuo’s physical body in a final blast of destruction. Akira absorbs Tetsuo’s psychic energy. Kaneda and Kei tell advancing foreign troops to stay out of Neo-Tokyo and ride off on their motorcycles. Volumes • Akira 1 (2009). Sets up the series, launches the mortal Kaneda-Tetsuo rivalry, and introduces many main characters. • Akira 2 (2010). Offers the story’s first climax with the reawakening of Akira; violent fights over his custody motivate explicit depictions of graphic violence. • Akira 3 (2010). The second climax, the destruction of Neo-Tokyo, offers a repeat of the initial apocalypse, indicating humanity has not learned much. • Akira 4 (2010). The rise of Akira and Tetsuo’s empire draws Americans and Russians into the conflict, calling into question Japanese sovereignty. • Akira 5 (2011). While Japanese factions fight one another in Neo-Tokyo, foreign forces are ready to ruthlessly wipe out all inhabitants with futuristic weapons of mass destruction. • Akira 6 (2011). After Tetsuo’s defeat, the series comes full circle as Kaneda and Kei return to life as juvenile motorcycle racers. Characters • Shotaro Kaneda, the protagonist, is a fifteenyear-old Japanese delinquent youth and leader of a teenage gang of motorcycle racers.

Kaneda combines human decency with a desire for adventure and distrust of authorities. Tetsuo Shima, the antagonist, is a repressed teenager who changes into a power-obsessed, demonic character once he obtains paranormal powers. He represents humanity’s dark side as he uses his psychic abilities brutally to seek ultimate personal power. Kei, the romantic interest of Kaneda, is an attractive and mature teenage girl involved with a violent antigovernment group. As a medium, she has no psychic powers herself but can channel those of true psychics; she helps Kaneda to defeat Tetsuo. Colonel Shikishima is a major character involved in the battle over Akira. He is a grown-up military man leading a secret government section in charge of psychics like Akira. More sinister in the beginning, he develops into an ally of Kaneda and Kei. Akira, the prized object of the series, is a powerful psychic in the body of a small boy. Passive and mild-mannered, he inadvertently destroys Tokyo twice when shocked by the violence around him. He appears to exist beyond good and evil. Lady Miyako, a supporting character, is an older female psychic who creates a temple cult and allies herself with Kaneda and Kei. She represents esoteric leaders in Japanese society. George Yamada, a spy and assassin, is an adult Japanese American sent to kill both Tetsuo and Akira. He is killed by Tetsuo. Ryu is an antigovernment rebel and ally of Kei, ostensibly her adult brother, but the series later makes this claim sound improbable. He helps to fight Tetsuo until he dies shortly before the end of Akira. Chiyoko, a major supporting character of Kaneda and Kei, is a middle-aged woman and weapons expert. Kaori is Tetsuo’s love interest; she is shot to death by Tetsuo’s jealous captain. 7\n\n​Akira​ Artistic Style Throughout Akira, Otomo’s style is extremely cinematic. His panels range from vast, long shots of urban landscapes to middle shots of a group of characters drawn against a visually vivid background and impressive close-ups of weapons or characters’ expressions. His illustrations create a distinctly dark atmosphere for the run-down parts of a rebuilt city transforming itself into a postapocalyptic landscape. Otomo’s large panoramic panels include haunting images, such as the forbidden bridge linking Neo-Tokyo to the original city or the dilapidated concrete exteriors and vandalized interiors of Kaneda’s vocational school. Otomo’s fascination with machines, particularly military hardware, stands out in the series. Kaneda’s futuristic motorcycle is drawn in loving detail. Helicopters, tanks, aircraft carriers, military special-purpose vehicles, and technical apparatuses are given visual preeminence. Depictions of graphic violence abound throughout Akira. When characters are killed, whether by telekinetic decapitations or by a barrage of gunfire, dark blood splatters on the panels and injuries are also depicted in graphic detail. Otomo delights in illustrating gun battles, chase scenes, and close person-to-person combat. Sound expressions almost literally explode in his panels, and violence appears ubiquitous and is the focus of much of the visual storytelling. Otomo’s characters are drawn to reflect the look of 1980’s Japan rather than a truly futuristic alternative. The hairstyle of Kaneda and his fellow gangsters has a distinct 1980’s look. The Colonel is drawn as a masculine leading man with crew cut, but he also has a diamond ear stud. Part of the freakishness of the psychics comes from the stark visual contrast of their child-sized and child-limbed bodies and their aged facial features. Overall, visuals and visual sound effects dominate the dialogue. There are no explanatory narrative captions after the bold, colorized introductory pages in the first volume. Generally, the reader is thrust right into the graphic action. Themes Even though Akira is set in the future, many of its themes can be traced to issues in 1980’s Japanese so8\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo Katsuhiro Otomo, born in 1954, is best known for his Akira manga, which began serialization in Kodansha’s Young Magazine in 1982, the same year Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner hit movie screens. The two creations bear numerous similarities, notably their depiction of metastasized urban settings and their enduring influence on pop culture. Akira ended its serialization in 1990; since then, Otomo has primarily been associated with film. He directed the 2004 Steamboy, an ambitious European escapade, and a live-action 2006 manga adaptation, the supernatural Mushishi. Like many manga and anime greats, Otomo fell into the professional orbit of the late Osamu Tezuka, scripting the film adaptation of Tezuka’s Metropolis. Akira remains Otomo’s sole long-form manga, though in early 2012, he announced plans for a new ongoing manga series aimed at male teen readers and taking place in the Meiji period (18681912). ciety. A key theme is rebellion against society, particularly by those like Kaneda, who resemble the generation of Japanese youths that felt left out of the “bubble economy” of the era. Kaneda and Tetsuo begin as friends in a teenage motorcycle gang that is modeled after the biker gangs popular in Japan in the 1980’s, which provoked traditional society. Kaneda and Tetsuo’s recreational drug use and drug dealing and their attendance at a decaying, graffiti-ridden vocational school are extrapolations of Japanese worries. A dominant theme of Akira is an intense amount of violence at all levels of human interaction. Violence ranges from criminal acts of juvenile delinquency to gunfights and military and paranormal confrontation. The existence of a violent antigovernment underground, of which Kei is a member, and the violent response by the military special forces under Colonel Shikishima have historical roots in the violent clashes over the building and expansion of Tokyo’s Narita International Airport from 1967 into the 1980’s. Otomo’s vision of the future incorporates this reemergence of political violence in Japan and widely\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels expands it to become a central element of his dystopian future society. The theme of paranormal power is used to comment further on possible negative trends in Japanese society. Deeply alienated from the society that has secretly created child-adults with enormous paranormal powers, many of the child-adults themselves resort to violence. Akira himself twice destroys Tokyo when he unleashes his telekinetic powers. Finally, as Akira was written in the last years of the Cold War and during heightened Japanese-American political tensions, the issue of nuclear war and American military intervention in Japan is a political theme of the series. After the fight against Tetsuo is won, Kaneda and Kei insist on Japanese sovereignty and send away foreign troops. Impact In Japan, the popular and critical success of Akira established Otomo’s enduring reputation as a great mangaka, or manga artist. His receipt of the coveted Kodansha Manga Award in the General Category in 1984 fueled the development of his series. Ironically, after completing Akira, Otomo turned from printed manga toward directing manga anime films. Otomo’s Akira inspired the next generation of manga artists, impressing them with its masterfully drawn vision of a violent future set in a decaying and destroyed city. By 2011, many important Japanese mangaka, such as Masashi Kishimoto, twenty years Otomo’s junior, credited Akira as being deeply influential on their contemporary work. In the United States, the initial publication of Akira in 1988 made it one of the first manga series to appear in English for a mass comics market. American audiences saw in Akira a powerful contribution to the cyberpunk genre. U.S. readers linked the manga to Ridley Scott’s dystopian science-fiction film Blade Runner (1982) and literary works such as William Gibson’s science-fiction novel Neuromancer (1984),\n\n​Akira​ which Otomo did not read until well into his Akira series. The enduring popularity of Akira in the United States fueled a manga boom in the 1990’s. It led to a 2009-2011 reissue of the six-volume collection of Otomo’s work. Akira is considered a classic of the matureaudience manga genre. Films Akira. Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo. Tokyo Movie Shinsha, 1988. The adaptation of Otomo’s manga series was the most expensively produced anime film at the time. It set new standards for high production values, featuring over 160,000 animation cels. Made while the Akira series was still going on, the film features most of the series’ characters and follows the story with only a few alterations. The film condenses the series by ending almost immediately after the destruction of Neo-Tokyo, with Tetsuo being absorbed by Akira. Kaneda, Kei, the Colonel, and most positive characters survive. R.

After a short stint in animation, Kibuishi pursued a career in comics and went on to edit and contribute to Flight (2007- ), an anthology of comics by creators mainly from the animation industry, and published first by Image Comics and later by Random House. Gathering stories for the fourth volume of Flight, Kibuishi discovered he had a collection of child-friendly comics, which he decided to publish as a separate anthology called Flight Explorer, featuring an original story of his Web comic Copper. In 2005, Scholastic Books launched Graphix, the first graphic novel imprint from a traditional children’s publishing company, and editors sought creators to follow their first group of releases, which included Jeff Smith’s Bone (1991-2004). Raina Telgemeier, illustrator of the graphic novel adaptations of The BabySitters Club (2006) and a previous Flight contributor, asked Kibuishi if she could show his work to editors at Scholastic. Kibuishi pitched Amulet with six completed pages and a one-page story synopsis, and the book was acquired. Amulet was first signed to a threevolume series, then a five-volume series. Plot Two years after their father’s death in a tragic car accident, Emily and Navin Hayes move with their mother Karen from the city to an old house that belonged to their great-grandfather Silas Charnon, a mysterious inventor who disappeared years ago. In Silas’s library, Emily finds a magical amulet that warns her to protect her family. That night, their mother is kidnapped by an 10\n\nKazu Kibuishi Like Stan Sakai before him, Kazu Kibuishi is a Tokyo-born writer-artist who, despite having been raised in the United States, is often associated in readers’ imaginations with manga and anime. His Amulet series, published by Scholastic, has drawn a substantial audience, as does his free Web comic, Copper (a compilation of which has also been published by Scholastic). Amulet is an ongoing steampunky, alternate-universe tale with teen protagonists, while Copper is an anecdotal “boy-and-his dog” yarn. Kibuishi’s influence extends beyond his own original works: He founded the anthology journal Flight, initially published by Image Comics, later by Ballantine. It was created to showcase the work of his friends. Kibuishi is a graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and continues to live in Southern California. He has cited Hayao Miyazaki and Bone’s Jeff Smith as his biggest influences.\n\narachnopod, and the children must descend beneath the basement to an underground world. After Emily attempts to free her mother from the creature using a magical bolt of energy, the voice of the amulet advises the children to seek help from their long-lost greatgrandfather. The children are brought to a mysterious house by Misket, a small rabbit-like robot and one of Silas’s assistants. On his deathbed, Silas speaks of Emily’s amulet and how it contains the power to rule Allendia, the alternate Earth where he has been living all these years. Emily, reluctant to accept this power and responsibility, is told by Silas that the amulet has the power to control time. Emily imagines the return of her dead father and accepts the amulet’s power as Silas passes away. Misket locates the pack of arachnopods with the children’s kidnapped mother, and the trio travels to intercept them. After an initial struggle, the group fails to free Karen, who is jabbed with a poisonous stinger.\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels After a crash landing, Emily finds an elf creature, which has been previously spying on the children, facing down the arachnopod holding her mother. Using his own amulet, the elf creature, Prince Trellis, frees Karen from the arachnopod and captures Emily. Using a creature that can alter thoughts, he tries to coerce her into helping him destroy his father, the Elf King. Emily destroys the thought creature, and the amulet tries to convince her to kill the fallen prince; she resists and lets him go. Back at Silas’s house, Karen is in a coma, poisoned by the arachnopod. In desperate need of an antidote, the group heads to the city of Kanalis using the only transportation that remains, which transforms into a giant robot. The Stonekeeper’s Curse (Volume 2) opens with Trellis scolded by his father for failing to capture the two children. Convinced that Trellis is likely to fail again, the Elf King orders Luger—another elf warrior—to accompany him. In Kanalis, Emily and the others bring Karen to Dr. Weston, who describes a lifesaving fruit that can be found only on the peak of Demon’s Head Mountain, a treacherous journey. Leon Redbeard, a humanoid fox, overhears the doctor’s instructions and offers to accompany the group on their quest. When an army of elves led by Luger and Trellis surrounds the doctor’s office, Navin and others escape in an underground trolley, while Emily, Leon, and Misket take to the rooftops of the city. Arriving at the hidden underground headquarters of the Resistance—an army that opposes the Elf King— Navin meets Father Adler, an ancient tree who has a vision in which Emily falls off a cliff to her death. Before Adler can finish explaining his vision, Navin orders the Resistance to take back the robot house from the elves so that he can use it to save his sister. The Elf King delivers new instructions to Luger: Have Prince Trellis kill the children, and if he hesitates, Luger is to kill the prince. Reaching the forest of the ancient Godoba trees, Emily finds the fruit to cure her mother. Leaving Trellis behind, Luger reaches the forest and burns it down. He travels quickly, coming face-to-face with Emily and her friends and overpowering them. Prepared to kill Emily, Luger is attacked from behind by Trellis. Luger\n\n​Amulet​ allows the amulet to take him over, and he transforms into a giant beast. Luger throws Emily and Leon off a cliff, just as Father Adler had prophesied, but Navin catches them in the hand of the robot house before they fall to their deaths. Combining the strength of the robot house and the power of Emily’s amulet, the house delivers a punch that seems to destroy Luger. Exhausted, Emily passes out but wakes to find that her mother is cured of the arachnopod’s poison. When Karen says they can finally go home, Emily explains that she must stay and fulfill her destiny as a stonekeeper. The Cloud Searchers (Volume 3) begins with Trellis finding a defeated Luger guarding his destroyed amulet. They both renounce their loyalty to the Elf King. At the Elf King’s palace, Gabilan, an elf assassin, receives his mission: Kill both Emily and Prince Trellis. Back in the robot house, Leon researches information on the location of the city of Cielis, home of the Guardian Council, a group of five of the most powerful stonekeepers, and the next destination for the group. The group travels to the city of Nautilis to find an airship that will take them to Cielis. At a local tavern, Emily and Leon find pilots—Enzo and Rico—and try to persuade them to shuttle the group. While the group discusses travel plans, two elf warriors find Trellis and Luger hiding in an alley behind the tavern. Emily recognizes the Elf Prince and defeats the two warriors. Ready to head to Enzo’s airship, the group, including Trellis and Luger, is faced with an elf-piloted tank, but they manage to escape. In the tavern, Gabilan confronts the two injured elf warriors and uses a memory extractor to gain information on the whereabouts of Emily and Prince Trellis. On the airship, Leon verifies the location of Cielis in the eye of a massive storm, and Enzo makes preparations to fly through it.

Morrie is a robot creation of Silas Charnon that looks like a traditional robot. He is often nervous and wary but is also caring and stood by Karen Hayes’s bedside when she was poisoned. Cogsley is another robot creation of Silas Charnon who also looks like a traditional robot. His gruff exterior does little to hide the fact that he is hardworking, deeply loyal, and honest. Trellis is the son of the Elf King. He is mysterious, power hungry, and rebellious. At first, he hunts Emily down to coerce her to help him kill his own father, but later he shows signs of a conscience and eventually joins Emily. The Elf King is the main antagonist of the series. He is the ruler of Allendia and wears a stylized mask. He is ruthless and determined to kill Emily and her friends to prevent them from destroying him. Once a promising young stonekeeper, the Elf King was corrupted by the amulet power and is now dead. His body serves as a vessel for the dark power of the amulet. Luger is an Elf warrior whom the Elf King sends with Trellis to find and kill Emily. Luger succumbs to the power of the amulet and becomes a giant monster. He is defeated by Emily, loses his powers, becomes docile, and accompanies Trellis when the prince joins Emily’s group. Leon Redbeard, a bounty hunter from the city of Kanalis, is a humanoid fox and a powerful fighter. He accompanies Emily on her journey and mentors her to control her great powers. He understands her importance in the future of Allendia and stands by her side through all dangers. Gabilan, the main antagonist of Volume 3, is a masked elf assassin hired by the Elf King to hunt down both Emily and Prince Trellis. He is crafty and without mercy and has plans of his own to take over the land of Allendia.\n\nArtistic Style Kibuishi’s artistic style is heavily influenced by his previous career in animation and his love for Japanese comics and animation, especially the work of Hayao\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels Miyazaki. When placed on the book’s heavy rendered backgrounds, his characters, drawn using fine lines, pop off the page, therefore resembling an animation cel. Characters are designed in bright, flat colors, creating a further juxtaposition to the lush and painterly backgrounds. Kibuishi draws on his previous experience using Photoshop for concept paintings for video games and animation to create effects that give his work a distinct, moody tone. The first book of the series features a heavy, dark palette, symbolizing the movement from the real world to the fantasy world of Allendia. In Volumes 2 and 3, the backgrounds are brighter and more colorful than before to show off landscapes and fantastical cities. A number of single-page images and double-page spreads illustrate the scope of the world of Allendia and emphasize the world-building aspect of Amulet. Kibuishi employed background artists to help with more detail in these pages. The pages in Amulet are open but include a large amount of visual details. Kibuishi is an artist who relies heavily on images and visual clues to move the story along. Panel layout is varied but readable, an important element for a graphic novel aimed at children. Kibuishi also uses a mix of decompressed scenes to illustrate character moments or create narrative tension, but he also uses fast-paced action scenes, making the series appealing to both children and adults. Kibuishi uses standard word balloons but plays with lettering by enlarging or stretching text when he wants to convey excitement or danger. Sound effects are also a strong element that helps to establish action and mood. Themes Amulet is aimed at children; thus, growing up is a major theme. Both Emily and Navin are forced into maturity at the beginning of the series by the death of their father. With their mother kidnapped and then poisoned, roles are reversed, as Emily and Navin risk their lives to save their only remaining parent. The revelation of the prophesied destinies of Emily (as potential ruler of Allendia) and Navin (as commander of the Resistance army) adds urgency to the maturation of the two children but also gives them confidence to fulfill their important roles.\n\n​Amulet​ The next major theme is power, as illustrated by the amulets that each stonekeeper possesses. The series explores the fine balance between controlling power and being consumed by it. Throughout the story, the amulet constantly tries to convince Emily to give in to its seductive power. Kibuishi has stated how the original Star Wars trilogy is an influence on Amulet, which also explores the nature of power from both sides, dark and light. Leon Redbeard vows to help Emily focus and control her powers and acts as mentor, in a way similar to characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. The Elf King provides readers with an example of what happens when power consumes all. As revealed in Volume 3, the Elf King himself is dead but the dark power of his amulet has taken complete control and animates his body. Also, with her red hair and control of pink-tinted energy from her amulet, Emily is reminiscent of Jean Grey of the X-Men, who also fought against her growing dark power in X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga (2006). Family is also a key theme in Amulet. With the death of their father, Emily and Navin come to appreciate and cherish their family, and when their mother is in danger they stop at nothing to rescue her. The various characters Emily and Navin meet on their journey also become part of their extended family. Even Silas’s robot assistants show love and emotion for the two children. Even though Emily is to be protected because of her potential to rule Allendia, she risks her own life in many instances to save these newfound friends. When Cogsley and Misket are snatched off the airship in Volume 3, it is devastating for Emily to leave them behind. The relationship between Trellis and the Elf King illustrates what happens when family breaks down. Even Trellis, who is an antagonist in the first and second books, comes to join Emily’s family in Volume 3. Impact Amulet is one of the more successful children’s graphic novel series published in the first decade of the twentyfirst century, and it has appeared on best-seller lists in both the United States and Canada. As the number of graphic novels created specifically for children has grown, Amulet holds a firm place in the category, espe13\n\n​Amulet​ cially as an ideal follow-up to Smith’s Bone. Kibuishi has said he hopes that Amulet introduces children to comics, especially after hearing from librarians, booksellers, and teachers about the need for more comics suitable and engaging for young readers. Amulet can be viewed as a direct extension of Flight Explorer, his first commitment to offering exciting stories for children, and Flight, which introduced readers to stories with strong narrative visuals, lush coloring, and high production values. Published by Scholastic, the largest North American children’s publishing company, Amulet has had the unique opportunity to reach a larger audience through Scholastic’s sales channels, including traditional bookstores and the school market, book clubs and book fairs. Amulet is indicative of the growing trend of the darkening of children’s literature. The first volume opens with the tragic death of Emily and Navin’s father. After crashing through a highway guardrail, the Hayeses’ car remains teetering on a cliff. Emily and her mother manage to escape, but their father is trapped inside as the car plummets off the cliff. Kibuishi portrays the death honestly and with deep emotion. At the beginning of the series, Kibuishi raises the stakes for readers, preparing them for a story that is both challenging and meaningful. The series has been generally well reviewed, especially in library journals, which have praised the series’ artwork, character design, pacing, and wide appeal. In addition to winning a state award, The Stonekeeper was\n\n14\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels one of American Library Association’s Best Books for Young Adults, selected as a Children’s Choice by the International Reading Association, and nominated for an Eisner Award in the Best Publication for Kids category, all in 2009. Also, soon after the release of Volume 1, actor Will Smith optioned the film rights as a vehicle for his two children, Willow and Jaden. Since then, the rights have been reverted, and the film is no longer in development. With only the third book released by 2011 and seven more in the works, Amulet’s popularity is likely to grow with each book published. Scott Robins Further Reading Miyazaki, Hayao.

In this manga, Atom had a supporting role. The story was later retouched and inserted into the Astro Boy series as a prequel and as an episode of the 1963-1966 animated television series. The first version of Atom was inspired by Mitchy, the androgynous robot from another manga by Tezuka (Metropolis), and by Perri, a robot character created by manga author Fukujiro Yokoi. The Tetsuwan Atom series was first published weekly in Shōnen from April, 1952, to March, 1968, and then in other publications until 1981: From 1967 to 1969 the series was published in a newspaper; two other series/reeditions were published in 1972-1973 and in 1980-1981. There have been many reprints and several reeditions of the manga, often with changes, including the 1981 Sun Comics collected edition by Akita Shoten, which is the most renowned in Japan and abroad as it is the version used for foreign editions. The Akita Shoten collection contains, in many stories, newly added pages drawn by Tezuka as introductory commentary. From a philological point of view, these editions have two negative aspects: Tezuka often intervened by retouching and redrawing several details of the pages, therefore even the so-called ultimate edition is different from the original, which is hard to find even in Japan, and the order of publication that Tezuka and Akita Shoten wanted was not the original order (stories from the 1960’s are mixed with stories from the 1950’s).\n\nOsamu Tezuka By the early 1960’s, Osamu Tezuka had launched an animation studio within Tezuka Productions and brought Astro Boy to the small and big screens. Other productions included anime adaptations of his Jungle Emperor (a.k.a. Kimba the Lion) and Dororo manga, the latter a dark fable about a limbless ronin. Tezuka’s production cycle remains largely the norm in Japan: storytelling is refined in manga (where it develops an audience) and is then ported to animation (as well as to merchandise and games). Tezuka never pursued medicine as a career, but it informed his later era, more mature dramatic manga, notably the werewolf-themed Ode to Kirihito (1970-1971), the tales of mercenary doctor Black Jack (1973-1983), and his final original manga, A Tree in the Sun (1981-1986), the story of a doctor modeled on his own greatgrandfather. Tezuka died in 1989.\n\nIn the United States, the first version of Astro Boy was not Tezuka’s original manga but an apocryphal version published by Gold Key in 1965, licensed by NBC (which had been broadcasting the Astro Boy animated series since 1963), and based on the television version, but which was severely criticized by Tezuka. Whether or not Tezuka legally authorized this version is unknown. In 1987-1988, the twenty-issue color comic book The Original Astro Boy was published by NOW Comics. In 2002, Dark Horse Comics began translating, directly into trade-paperback volumes, the Akita Shoten collection, recognized by Tezuka as definitive. The American edition consists of twenty-three books published from March, 2002, to January, 2004. Volumes 1 and 2 were later republished as one trade paperback in September, 2008. All the volumes follow the Japanese order of publication of the Akita Shoten edition, and the pages are turned in order to make reading the manga more natural for Western readers. The American edition is translated by renowned manga 15\n\n​Astro Boy​ scholar Frederik L. Schodt, who offers a contextualizing introduction in the first volume. Plot Tetsuwan Atom is a “story manga” (a concept introduced in Japan by Tezuka) consisting of weekly episodes that form various story arcs. It is a seventy-threeepisode series, formed by adventures of various lengths in which Atom (Astro in the American version) fights evil robots, solves crimes, and helps humans. The manga was created by Tezuka for children, and it is a prototype of the manga category known as “shōnen.” It is also one of the first examples of science-fiction manga in the post-World War II period and offers an optimistic vision of the future. The narrative structure is based on a prior event, which readers may rely on to understand Atom’s psychology and behavior as well as those of his partners. Atom is born from a tragedy. In the early twenty-first century, Dr. Umatarō Tenma (Dr. Astor Boynton II), director general of the Japanese Ministry of Science, has a beloved son Tobio (Toby) who dies in a car accident; overwhelmed by grief, Tenma decides to build a powerful and clever robot whose appearance is identical to Tobio’s and who is activated on April 7, 2003. When the scientist realizes that this robot, however sophisticated, is not Tobio and cannot grow as a normal child, he sells him to a circus. After some time, Atom is rescued by the new director general, Dr. Ochanomizu (Dr. Packadermus J. Elefun), a defender of robots’ civil rights. Atom begins a new life: Ochanomizu creates two robot parents and two siblings for Atom. Among Atom’s best friends are Higeoyaji (Mr. Mustachio), a detective, and young Ken’ichi, a classmate. Atom attends school and plays with other children like a normal child, but he also fights crime and injustice around the world so that robots can live in harmony with humans. In the American edition of Tetsuwan Atom, identifying a coherent sequence among the story arcs is nearly impossible. Nevertheless, the story manga structure allows readers to enjoy extensive and independent self-contained narratives. Some specific stories can be pinpointed that constitute relevant plot turns. “Atlas” (Volume 18 in the Dark Horse edition) marks the introduction of the eponymous robot, which 16\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels contains the “Omega Factor,” a device that makes him evil; Atlas is one of the most powerful robots in the world, and the Omega Factor, which makes robots capable of hurting or killing humans, is an important element of Tetsuwan Atom’s mythology. “Mad Machine” (Volume 3) deals with the concept of a “day off” for robots and the subsequent problems among humans; the story is an important allegory about slavery and workers’ rights. In The Greatest Robot on Earth (Volume 3) a powerful robot named Pluto, programmed to destroy the seven strongest robots on Earth, faces Atom after having destroyed the other robots. “The Blue Knight” (Volume 19) introduces a robot that is a hero among other mechanical men because it defends them against humans who treat them badly; the story is a significant parable about racism and discrimination. Characters • Atom, a.k.a. Astro (English edition), is sustained with nuclear power and has a 100,000 horsepower reactor. He understands sixty languages and has rockets coming out of his limbs, machine guns in his backside, lasers inside the fingers, and other powers and functions. He is a mechanical copy of Tobio Tenma (Astor Boynton). He tries to be as human as possible and has delicate feelings and a deep sense of justice. • Dr. Ochanomizu, a.k.a. Dr. Packadermus J. Elefun and Mr. Pompous, director general of the Ministry of Science, is a stout, middle-aged man with white hair and a big nose; he is an assumed father for Atom and helps him in his adventures. • Higeoyaji, a.k.a. Old Man Moustache, Dr. Walrus, and Mr. Mustachio, is a stout, bald, middle-aged man who declares himself a private detective. He is Tezuka’s representation of the Japanese Everyman, full of common sense. Like Ochanomizu, he is like a father to Atom and often helps the little robot in his missions for peace and justice. • Dr Umatarō Tenma, a.k.a. Dr. Astor Boynton II, is Atom’s inventor and the father of late Tobio Tenma. He is a brilliant man of science and was a good soul before losing his nerve after his son’s death. He has become a sort of evil scientist.\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels\n\n• Uran, a.k.a. Zoran or Astro Girl, is a robot girl created by Ochanomizu as Atom’s sister.\n\n• Cobalt, a.k.a. Jet, is Astro’s brother; like Uran, he\n\nis similar to Atom but less advanced. • Atlas, a somewhat dark version of Atom, was created either by Tenma or, in other versions of the manga, by other villains. He first appears in 1956. He is equipped with a program called Omega Factor, which allows robots to ignore the basic rules of not hurting or killing humans. • Osamu Tezuka is a metacharacter who often appears in stories and comments on them. Artistic Style Tezuka’s style in Astro Boy is most representative of manga for children in the 1950’s and 1960’s. From the illustrative point of view, figures are round and soft. Tezuka was inspired by American commercial animation from the 1930’s and 1940’s (especially Walt Disney’s and Max Fleischer’s); features such as eyes, faces, bodies, and hands derive directly from those styles. These kinds of figures are visually enjoyable for children, easily readable as images, and create a sense of affection. Tezuka’s innovation with these types of characters is that, despite being visually cartoonish, they are mortal; people and robots in Tezuka’s works can actually die, and sometimes do). Tezuka’s mise-en-scène is innovative. The composition of the panels within the page is dynamic; panels have various shapes and sizes, giving readers an impression of movement and suggesting a reading pace. In Astro Boy, synthesis is fundamental: Backgrounds are drawn only when necessary to the narrative, and figures are always neatly drawn at the center of the scene. Tezuka’s drawings naturally evolved from 1951 to 1968 (and in subsequent versions of Astro Boy), but this evolution is hardly recognizable in the American edition for two reasons: Tezuka revised most of his stories for the Akita Shoten edition, trying to homogenize the drawing style, and his preferred order of publication inhibits readers from noticing significant changes in Atom.\n\n​Astro Boy​\n\nVideo Games Media crossover is an important part of any manga franchise, and many successful manga series have anime tie-ins, soundtracks, and video games. The following is a list of video games, for multiple gaming platforms, featuring the Astro Boy character. • Tetsuwan Atom (Mighty Atom). Developed by Home Data. Published by Konami, 1988. Available for personal computers and Nintendo, this was the first video game devoted to Astro Boy. • Tetsuwan Atom (Atom). Developed by Zamuse. Published by Banpresto, 1994. Available for Super Famicom and Nintendo. Like the previous version, this game is based on the 1963 animated series. • Astro Boy. Developed by Sonic Team. Published by Sega, 2003. Available for PlayStation 2. This videogame is based on the 2003 animated series devoted to Astro Boy. • Astro Boy: Omega Factor. Developed by Treasure/Hitmaker. Published by Sega, 2004. Available for Game Boy Advance. This video game uses almost the entire Astro Boy canon and was well-received. • Astro Boy: The Videogame. Developed by High Voltage Software/Art Co. Published by D3, 2009. Available for Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo DS. This video game is based on the American 3D animated movie, and its design adheres to the movie rather than to the manga. • Astro Boy: Tap Tap Rush. Developed and published by Widefos, SJ Games, and Tezuka Production, 2010. Available for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad.\n\n17\n\n​Astro Boy​ Themes In Astro Boy, there are three main levels of interpretation. On the first level, the manga is basically a sciencefiction/adventure serial for children, in which each adventure contains a hidden moral, meaning that, thanks to Tezuka’s ability to avoid pedantic storytelling, young readers will learn without even noticing. On another level, the series offers an antiracist, propacifist, and optimistic view of Japan: Many of the characters demonstrate a self-evident otherness and struggle to be accepted by so-called normal people, whether they be humans, Japanese, or earthlings. This kind of moral message is central to Atom Taishi. The third level of interpretation adds both historical and political dimensions related to the international role of postwar Japan, as seen by Tezuka in the early 1950’s. Because Atom was “a boy of twelve,” one can interpret Astro Boy as a parable of Japan’s emergence from the terrible defeat (and exposure to atomic weaponry) of World War II. Atom is a child-robot born from collapsed Japan and looks toward a future of peace and dialogue with the world’s political powers. In this sense, Astro Boy is a long-running series of moral apologues for both Tezuka’s generation and, above all, the generation of children born after the war who learned to live by a new set of pacifist values. Impact Atom/Astro is one of the most famous fictional characters in the world. In Japan, Tetsuwan Atom has had a deep and lasting effect on Japanese popular culture. Its general plot and symbols stimulated reflection among young readers, and its sales have been impressively constant for decades (it is one of the most reprinted and reedited manga of all time). Japanese culture and society have so deeply absorbed Astro Boy’s values and content that the manga is considered a national treasure. Tetsuwan Atom was the first Japanese animated series to be broadcast in the United States, and Astro is one of the most-remembered non-American cartoon characters. Though American audiences did not initially recognize the story as a Japanese narrative, Astro Boy was celebrated in later years as a genuine Japanese masterwork. The Astro Boy fran18\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels chise has remained lively in the United States, although mainly among those who watched the 1960’s series. Finally, from a narrative and graphical point of view, Astro Boy is an important chapter in Tezuka’s long and busy career. Its impact as a series is considerable, but its innovations in style and theme are key to Tezuka’s overall canon. Storytelling elements such as the “star system” (characters that recur from one manga to another), and the use of panels with dynamic shapes and visual storytelling, along with Tezuka’s courageous sensibility in dealing with important values, have had strong influences on generations of readers and comics creators.

The magazine is aimed at adolescent girls, and many major female manga creators have made their debut in it. The art of Banana Fish, however, was radically different from what was appearing in the magazine at the time, eschewing the stylized character designs and flowery art and writing of early-1990’s shōjo comics. Yoshida had published several short series prior to Banana Fish, but Banana Fish was an immediate hit and cemented her status as a great creator. The series ran until April, 1994. Yoshida also completed three extra chapters, showing some characters’ first meetings, and one epilogue chapter set years after the end of the series. Banana Fish was collected in Japan through Flower Comics, an imprint of Shogakukan, in nineteen volumes, an additional volume collecting the short stories, an art book, and a guidebook. VIZ Media began printing English-translated chapters in their magazines Pulp and Animerica Extra in collected volumes starting in 1998. These volumes had flipped (left-to-right) artwork at slightly larger-than-digest size; only the first seven volumes were part of the first edition. A subsequent edition had right-to-left art in a standard digest size; this edition was published from 2004 to 2007 and included two of the extra chapters. 20\n\nBanana Fish (Courtesy of VIZ Media) Plot Banana Fish has two major plot threads: The first involves teenage gang leader Ash Lynx and his struggle for revenge against mob boss Dino “Papa” Golzine; the second centers on the mysterious “banana fish” and the underworld war that erupts over it. In 1985 Ash Lynx, a seventeen-year-old gang leader in New York City, witnesses two of his underlings attacking a man who gives Ash a small vial, an address in Los Angeles, and the phrase “banana fish”\n\nCritical Survey of Graphic Novels before dying. Ash’s men were acting on the orders of Dino “Papa” Golzine, a major Mafia figure who controlled Ash’s life for most of his youth, training him and sexually abusing him. Golzine confronts Ash about the murder, but Ash reveals nothing. Golzine allows his men to capture and torture Ash until he reveals the truth. Meanwhile, Ibe Shunichi, a magazine writer, and Eiji Okamura, his young photographer, arrive in New York City to do a story on youth gangs. Thanks to Ibe’s friend Max Lobo, a former soldier and writer, they are able to interview Ash in person. Ash and Eiji are captured by Golzine’s men, and then Ash is briefly put in the same prison as Lobo, where they discover their connection: Ash’s older brother was in the Vietnam War with Lobo and went insane, firing on his own unit and saying only the words “banana fish.” Lobo was forced to cripple him in order to stop his rampage; thus, Ash swears revenge on Lobo. When Ash is bailed out, he, Eiji, Lobo, Ibe, and Ash’s friend Shorter travel to Los Angeles to track down the address. They find the home of Dr. Abraham Dawson, who has gone missing, and Dawson’s adopted son, Yau-Si. Ash finds Dawson’s notes on “banana fish,” which is revealed to be a drug. Yau-Si is actually part of the Lee family, head of the American Chinese underworld. He captures Eiji and brings him back to New York with Shorter. Ash and the rest follow, and all are brought before Golzine, who reveals the truth about banana fish: It is a form of LSD that can brainwash a person into doing or believing anything. Golzine plans to provide the drug to the U.S. government, which will use it to destabilize communist governments in South America, providing Golzine with easy access to cocaine in exchange.

Ash allies with Sing Soo-Ling, who becomes head of the Chinese gangs after Shorter’s death; Yau-Si and Golzine enter into an alliance of convenience.
