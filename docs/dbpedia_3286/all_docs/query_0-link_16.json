Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this editorial!)\n\nConsidering we could very well see an animation strike any day now, you know I’ll be fully on board with the strike and the creatives in the industry telling the industry itself that the current working conditions are not okay, and that generative AI has no place in the workplace. Because the heads of studios are also willing to simply halt production and or cancel anything animated, it’s going to be a miracle that any show survived the recent mergers and are released. Yes, we sadly lost Clone High once again, and many other projects are either going to get dumped out or removed from existence because monstrous individuals like David Zaslav can’t buy a fifth mega yacht. Luckily, some other studios are willing to buy the rights to certain projects that have been put into limbo and give them a proper release. It’s going to be weird to see a show that was meant to be made for one studio end up on another service or channel because of poor decisions from the higher-ups, but again, the fact they get released in this current tumultuous time is a miracle, and thank goodness someone decided that Batman: Caped Crusader should be given a new life on Prime.\n\nIt’s rather simple. You focus more on the already mentioned noir and thriller perspective of each story and build up the characters that revolve around those elements. It’s a more methodical journey as you see the twists and turns that follow our characters. Some characters get season-long arcs, while some, depending on how familiar you are with the characters, are going to have some fairly obvious fates. The way they mold and build up these characters results in some of these iterations of the characters being the most interesting versions. The way they build up characters like Harvey Dent and Harley Quinn is great, because they aren’t just repeating familiar story beats with them from previous incarnations. I know many folks love the preferred versions from stuff like the '90s show versions of the two, but seeing Harley be her own character/villain outside of the Joker’s looming shadow was refreshing. Seeing Harvey have a more realistic disfigured look and more emphasis put on his mental issues paints him more of a tragic figure, and you don’t use the more stylized design seen in other incarnations of the villain. You even see more of the detectives this time around, and Bruce Wayne himself often shows up for maybe a third or less of the overall runtime of each episode. He’s there enough to make it a Batman show, but we also see him as a more novice Batman. The big problem that some previous versions ran into like Bruce Timm’s take on the character during Justice League/Unlimited and Brave and the Bold is that it focused on Batman being too heavily prepared and victorious for every situation. Sure, you can say that those versions worked for the shows for which they were made, but not every superhero is going to be so prepared that it makes each combat encounter trivial. In this show, we see a Batman that is more careful and not using a ton of fancy gadgets, as you mostly see him use smoke bombs and the grappling hook, but not much else. He has to be a bit scrappier in fights, but luckily this universe they are building right now feels more grounded. As much as I love Batman as a franchise, some incarnations focus a bit too much on the superpowers of other individuals, and as of this season, we see more grounded takes on villains like Clayface. All I’m going to say is they might have the same or similar backstories as other versions, but they aren’t going to be turning into monstrous creatures five times bigger than our hero. Even getting a new take on a familiar face like The Penguin, voiced by Minnie Driver was something I didn’t know this franchise needed until I saw it in the first episode. The only one who doesn’t get too much change in her backstory is Catwoman, but she is still a fun character to see in this version of the show with her visuals being more inspired by her older counterparts and less by her new ones. The fact that this show balanced out its villain roster for season one with both familiar faces and some lesser-known villains like Onomatopoeia showed that they were ready to not just rehash the same villain roster as previous shows did. Sure, you get a tease of the big bad himself at the end of the final episode, but the show was compelling enough to slowly introduce us to this version of the world and the experience of it all.\n\nAnimation-wise, it looks like a more polished version of Bruce Timm’s previous ventures into adapting and working on DC animated projects. It doesn’t have the repetitive body types that plagued his other work and it truly does look good from an art direction and design perspective. I wish they had done a little more to match the dramatic lighting of the 90s cartoon if they were going for a more noir angle with this take, but it still has that moody grimy feel that you get from the period in history in which this show takes place. It doesn’t have the flashiest action, but it’s not meant to be flashy. It makes you feel the weight of the punches and the movements. This more subdued color pallet also blends into the designs of the villains like Clayface and Two-Face. Now voicework-wise, they did do a good job, but with some hiccups along the way. We get some great performances from the likes of Minnie Driver as Penguin, Jason Watkins as Alfred, Diedrich Bader as Harvey Dent, Christina Ricci as Catwoman, and Jamie Chung as Harley Quinn, but of course, the sink-or-swim survival of this show was going to come down to Hamish Linklater as Batman. At first, I found him to sound too rough as both Batman and his alter ego, but he grew on me as the season went on, and he was able to balance out a more normal tone and the Batman tone. It didn’t sound great in the first episode, and it distracted me when the first few bits of Bruce Wayne were clunky, but Hamish is a good Batman. Another performance I like is Reid Scott as Onomatopoeia who only speaks in, well, onomatopoeias. A fairly imposing figure with the great design of his mask and his physical look that made for a threatening vibe. Other performances include Tom Kenny as Firebug, Toby Stephens as Gentleman Ghost, Dan Donohue as Clayface, and Krystal Joy Brown as Barbara Gordon. It’s a stacked cast, and it also brought back a sound that has been missing from a lot of DC animated shows and animation in general. Instead of just getting the biggest names for the sake of having the biggest names to voice these characters, they chose actors with distinct sounds to their voices like Michelle C. Bonilla as Renee Montoya. It’s something I have missed since the days of the Justice League/Unlimited run of shows, and also having actors like Jeff Bennett, Gary Anthony Williams, and John DiMaggio as side characters is always a plus. A surprise in the voice cast I had to double-check was Paul Sheer in episode one, and Haley Joel Osment in episode eight. Again, a great ensemble of talented actors for these specific roles.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

The show with TIgra and Dazzler didn’t leave the production stage, MODOK only lasted one season, Howard the Duck also didn’t go anywhere, and Hit Monkey is now the only one from that deal to thrive and survive. I mean, when you have a bunch of corporate execs making the calls, you would also learn how to survive the chopping room floor. The first season was pretty solid with an interesting and compelling revenge thriller plot that set us up with a season two. Not without its faults, but Hit Monkey is one of the more entertaining takes on the Marvel series with its contemplative journey of discovery, revenge, and its hyper-violence brought to life by the same studio that did the Archer series, Floyd County Productions. Things went silent for a bit, but I was happy to see we finally got a season two to see where this journey takes our simian hitman and his ghostly sidekick. Could they overcome the season two slump or was Hit Monkey able to make his target? Here are my thoughts.\n\nWith season one, we go through a journey where Hit Monkey learns about the way violence and anger fuel us as he goes on a killing spree to get back at the folks that killed his tribe, and Bryce goes on a path to redemption for his actions past and present. We see how even though the action was pretty stellar, if a bit messy at points, their decision-making had consequences as they traversed the path to take care of the corruption that was infesting Japan's politics. Now, we follow our duo as the big theme of season two is forgiveness and connection. Monkey is tired of the constant violence of their work, Bryce tries to find a way to reconnect with his daughter that he hasn’t seen in 20 or so years, and they both take the help from some folks with questionable morals to get what they need. Monkey wants to feel like he belongs somewhere and to make a more peaceful life for himself and the world in which he lives, and Bryce makes a literal deal with the devil to get what he wants. It also continues the commentary on how violence and anger corrupt us as, instead of following Monkey’s path of violence, we follow what happens with Lady Bullseye. Or, well, the new Lady Bullseye who is using her new goal in life to take down Monkey for killing her uncle. Even the group that helps Monkey save the world and rid it of hate and violence galore almost comes off like they are also finding redemption for their previous lives as assassins. It’s a great core concept for this season, as there are plenty of stories from TV and shows about hired killers wanting to find a way to escape their blood-filled lives. It was one of the best elements of the film, The Execution Game. In that film, we followed our assassin who was tasked with taking out another hitman who was considered as good or even better than him. Instead of being a constant tug of war via a shootout between our leads, what drives that film’s plot is more about the lead, in that life where he has to constantly look over his shoulder, while his target is trying to leave that life due to not wanting to have to worry when his next day may be his last. You can see elements of that kind of story in Hit Monkey season two, as it's wrapped around the main goal of stopping this group who has a multitude of mystical weapons that drive the wielders mad with power. You want to see Hit Monkey find a more peaceful life, Haruka to find the killer that took out her police force, Bryce to reconnect with his daughter, and the tragedy of watching Akiko fall further and further down the rabbit hole of revenge and get egged on by the spirit of the original Lady Bullseye.\n\nThe new characters are fun to watch interact around our deadly duo, and the ex-hitmen have a fun powers and interesting backstories. Granted, not all of them get the same treatment and fleshed-out backstory, but some of the backstories that unravel around some of the ex-killers are truly messed up and tragic. This is where some of the problems from the first season continue into the second season. I know most folks are getting tired of the same Deadpool-style writing and quirky sensibilities in characters, and I would lie if I didn’t find the comedy that came from Bryce grating at points. It doesn’t help that the quippy nature of the comedy bleeds into the other characters in the show. It’s not like I never got a laugh out of the humor, but the self-awareness of it all feels clunky at points. Have you ever been in a situation where it feels like everyone wants to have the punchline or the last laugh? It’s like that at points, and more control over the dialogue needed to happen. Yes, this whole show’s premise is absurd and you have to have a very tongue-in-cheek approach to balancing out the lightweight and heavier moments, but it’s a show where the more dramatic moments worked better for me than the comedy. Bryce is the biggest offender of the show’s comedy, where he is constantly snarking on everything and is constantly called out for his snark. It’s a bummer, because Jason Sudeikis can deliver a genuinely funny line and can hit the more dramatic moments well. Due to how busy this show can feel, the plot line with Bryce’s daughter and her reconnecting with him gets the weakest conclusion, and she isn’t the most interesting character. The characters that interact around her are more entertaining with Rob Corddry’s character, who is a cleaner and gives Bryce’s daughter Iris her first job in the world of being a cleaner. Their interactions were some of the highlights of the season. The villains who own the mystical weapons aren’t the most interesting characters with the last one they target having the most personality, but they are more of a goal/building block to get to the actual villains and the core of the story.\n\nThe animation looks great. If you are familiar with the hit series Archer, and that show’s animation style, then you will get a similar experience here if you enjoyed Archer’s more action-focused episodes. There are times when the blurriness of the backgrounds and the animation can sometimes be a little hard to follow and look wonky, but the animation rigs are fantastic, the environments give off so much personality and atmosphere, and the designs are appealing. Even when the action can get a little blurry, much of the action is dynamic, thrilling, and hits hard when it needs to. Outside of the action, the show just looks good, and it has a distinct visual look for a generally adult-focused animated series, which is something most animation fans seem to not be able to be loud and supportive of when it happens. The voice cast is once again stellar with Fred Tatasciore’s role as the titular monkey. While it is all grunts and animal noses, he still brings out so much emotion in the character. You can tell what they are saying and thinking even without the subtitles or the other characters knowing what he is saying. The rest of the voice cast, old and new, are also great. Stephanie Beatriz is always a delight to hear, Keith David playing the devil is a lot of fun, Olivia Munn is as stellar as ever, Ally Maki is great, and Leslie Jones is always a win in my books. As I mentioned above, Cristin Milioti and Rob Corrdy are great in their scenes together, Reiko Aylesworth returns as the original Lady Bullseye and brings her menacing nature to conflict with Olivia Munn’s character, and we get a very layered performance from Nat Faxon, who honestly did put in probably the best performance of our antagonists, and we even get a fun appearance from Jim Gaffigan who plays this character with time manipulation.\n\nAs mentioned already in this review, the studio’s first film, Mary and the Witch’s Flower, was more in line with more typical fantastical Ghibli offerings, that while still good, had a hard time finding its own identity to differentiate itself from the films of Studio Ghibli. This film still has Ghibli elements and art direction you would expect from a studio made up of ex-Ghibli folks. The biggest shift in its visual style is this softer texture feel to the colors and lighting. It feels dreamlike in this world of imaginary characters that live in their separate world alongside and away from the humans. It feels painterly at points, and the fact a lot of this is hand-drawn animation is wildly impressive. There are some amazing details like Mr. Bunting’s mouth when he devours imaginary friends, the ever-shifting landscape of the world around our characters when the world of imagination blends with the real world, and the beautiful color palette that brings you into this wondrous world. It reminds me of how a lot of Raymond Briggs’ work got adapted with that soft ethereal hue to the world. When we are in just the human world part of the setting, it looks lush and cozy, even when the horrors creep up. The vibrant design of the imaginary friends sprinkle in a lot of life, and how they even make them for famous folks in history brings substance to this world and its lore. Everyone, at one point or another, had an imaginary friend who was close to them for some reason. Whether it was a fictional dog that protected them, a friend that helped them feel safe, a point of inspiration for art, a friend that supported them through lonely times, or what have you, they find a way to make the world that they inhabit make sense. They also just look so cool, and I’m sure the artists had fun crafting how each of these wonderful little critters look, move, and portray what kind of story they tell with how they were created.\n\nSure, this film may use the polarizing use of dream logic to tell its story of a girl who feels alone but also must be strong in a world after dealing with losing her father, but a lot of movies use less than realistic logic to tell stories, because that’s how you craft experiences. You could use realistic science and reports about the human mind and how it crafts dream-like adventures and imaginary friends, but who cares? Do you care if romcoms have stories that aren’t 100% real? Would it be more compelling if it hit every single realistic note of your love life or would it be a chore? The thing about films like The Imaginary is that they work because they speak on a wavelength with which everyone can gel. We all wish we had a friend to help us through tough times and that we could also go on fantastical adventures with. We wish we could have a metaphorical guardian watching over us, or a hero that protects us in space during flights of fancy. Yes, we can’t wholly rely on these playful affairs to solve everything that is going on with the real world, but it can help us get through tough times, and remind us what is truly important to every one of us as we traverse our way through life. We all don’t want to be forgotten as the world moves and shifts around us, or to lose that spark inside us all that keeps us from collapsing in on ourselves because of the pressures that life puts on our laps. Mr. Bunting himself is possibly the scariest villain in any animated film and film in general. When you are a man who has lived for hundreds of years by feeding on imaginary friends to keep yourself alive, and are frankly stalking children like a predator, then you easily keep that cozy place at the front of the most sinister villains of any movie in 2024. The way he feeds off of fear and distress as the fictional friends and characters stress out about being forgotten is truly horrifying stuff, especially when you see him open his mouth to eat something. It’s straight out of someone’s nightmare, for sure. The story is also elevated by some great performances that include Louie Rudge-Buchanan, Evie Kiszel, Hayley Atwell, Sky Katz, Kal Penn, Jane Singer, Jeremy Shift, and Ruby Barnhill. It’s also funny to see Ruby Barnhill back, since she was the lead in Mary and the Witch’s Flower. I like that they got actual kids for the kid roles, and while I love voice actors who can play both young and adult characters, you need that splash of authenticity when your main characters are children. Still, seeing Jeremy Shift go from the nicest possible guy in Ted Lasso to the creepiest of creepy dirtbags is why acting is so fun. The music also matches the soaring highs and sorrowful lows of the film by composer Kenji Tamai who also worked on the beautiful albeit frustrating Sing Yesterday For Me from 2020.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this review!)\n\nApple TV+’s animation game has been a very mixed bag. Outside of a handful of family and children-based series, there hasn’t quite been a show or movie I have seen that has hit it out of the park. Central Park got canceled after three seasons, Luck was their first real foray into original feature animation that didn’t do well critically or viewership-wise, causing Apple to cut ties with Skydance Animation before they jumped ship to Netflix, and outside of Cartoon Saloon/Tom Moore’s Wolfwalkers, not many people talk about their animation stuff. It’s a shame, because I do like their Frog and Toad series, and Apple has enough faith in their work to not just cancel everything left and right like Netflix and Max do. The whole thing with Skydance is bizarre, because Apple was gearing up to have them on board as their version of Pixar, since they have now disgraced head of Pixar, John Lasseter, as one of the brains behind the studio. So then, we have a studio that has yet to make something that has a lasting impression, and now we have a new TV series that sadly, falls under the same failings as their feature film direction with Wondla.\n\nSadly, what we get is a fairly traditional post-apocalypse adventure with story beats that land where you know they will land, and the surprises and discoveries that we find are predictable and land with a thud. Not that being overly familiar is a bad thing, since I have seen films and shows that are basic, but are executed with such passion that you don’t care. I found myself constantly waiting for the plot points and twists to drop, and that doesn’t make it better when most of the characters are flat and uninteresting. The voice cast that includes Jeanie Mason, Gary Anthony Williams, Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Chike Okonkwo, D.C. Douglas, and Alan Tudyk are doing their best to make the material work, but due to how there are only seven episodes in this first season, you don’t get much time to be with them. There is no time for them to chill out or to make the reveals feel more natural. That’s been a big problem with a lot of recent streaming series, where studios are paying less and less for multi-episode seasons, and what we get are either broken-up movie-style experiences or shows that don’t have time to make everything work. This happened with the Hazbin Hotel series, and it happens here. An extra few episodes would have helped make the story feel more compelling and developed. Even the twists that are revealed don’t leave a lasting impact. There is a moment where you are brought to a new kingdom, and instead of letting the story discuss corruption in power and memories, for the most part, things wrap up nicely. That whole story beat does not get brought up a lot or help expand on what happened with the humans that used to live there.\n\nSadly, Wondla has come out at a time when the post-apocalypse genre has evolved and gone further than what we get with this show. Maybe the supposed second season will make up for what season one has been lacking, but who knows if we will get a second season. While it was confirmed this got a second-season order, it has been shown that companies like Netflix will cancel shows that were greenlit for second seasons. It isn’t the worst show I have seen since the Good Times reboot on Netflix was awful, but it doesn’t rise to the occasion that something like X-Men 97 did. With the current state of the entertainment industry, there are so many movies and shows coming out, and being just okay doesn’t cut it. It also doesn't help that some studios and companies are relying on an entirely faulty algorithm to give notes to creatives when they need to let creatives thrive and make their work stand out. Maybe this is what the books are like or maybe this was a bad adaptation hampered by production nonsense. I wish I liked this more because I’m always down for atmospheric and sci-fi mystery experiences. Honestly, I’m down for most types of experiences with animation. Skydance Animation has simply put, not released something worthwhile, and while I’m hoping for the best for their upcoming projects, Luck and Wondla has not put out a good impression of what they are crafting, or if they will put out something creative as long as John Lasseter is there. If you do want to check out a sci-fi post-apocalypse series, then go watch Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts. Maybe there is just no wonder in Wondla, so hopefully, they will show me the wonderland that they promise in the future.\n\nInstead of having a self-defense force that takes down kaiju, we focus on our Ultraman and the baby kaiju. It starts out with our lead being more disconnected from his family and the world, due to a monster attack. He’s cocky, thinks of himself with no humility, and has some lingering issues of trauma and grief. He doesn’t handle it very well. If he can’t handle his current emotional baggage, then you know he won’t be able to when he gets a giant monster baby dropped on his lap to take care of. While it does have some general family-friendly comedic antics with the struggle of a newly single dad who has to take care of this literal monster baby, the thing that holds this film together is how it focuses on the growing bond with not only our lead Sato and the baby, but Sato with everyone else in his life. The overall movie is about how we deal with the emotional baggage of losing someone close, how anger does more harm than good, reconnecting with folks that are close to us, the bonds we make, the relationships between fathers and sons, and you get the idea. It can be a fairly silly movie at points, but the emotional beats when they drop are fantastic. Even the imposing thread has some complications and isn’t just a straight-up bad guy. It’s a film with layers to the drama that our characters deal with, and it can also be a wholly relatable story with folks who become new parents, no matter if they are single or married. We may have it easier due to not having to raise a giant monster baby, but still. Sure, I would have loved to have seen more of the stuff from the franchise, like more monsters and maybe some of the aliens, and I felt like there was a huge missed opportunity with the lack of using a certain monster for the third act, but the focus truly is on the more human level of things. In a film and world where there are giant heroes taking care of giant threats, it never loses sight of what makes Shannon Tindle such a great creative who is good at capturing extremely intimate and emotional connections with the characters. I have seen lots of movies this year so far, and while I have my thoughts about them, Ultraman Rising was one of those films that will touch you at your core and pull on your heartstrings with some truly outstanding story sequences. And yes, there are constant references to Ultraman mixed into the background, the dialogue, and even the musical cues. They never feel distracting, and I felt constant joy when I could spot them.\n\nAnimation-wise, we have seen the trend and constant desire from film fans to do the bold stylized CGI route, and you get that in spades here. It might not go the extreme distance of something like Spider-Verse, but I am always happy when we see a new visual look for Ultraman. I still remember looking up episodes of different Ultraman series, and finding the fascinating design decision of giving the Ultramen in Ultraman Great and Ultraman Cosmos more human ears instead of something else or having no ear-like bits at all. I love the more lanky design of Ultraman and the stylish human designs. It gives everyone more personality than just sticking to the base human design we have seen in some films. It has all the polish and tender loving care given to the character animation that you would want in a stylized world. They are very appealing to look at, and they still look like they are from Ultraman and whatever monsters they fight in the film. It’s a sign of a good art direction from Keiko Murayama as character art director, and the overall art direction being helmed by Sunmin Inn. It has such striking colors and cool comic-bookish elements that make for a visual treat so wholly distinct from other films this year and of this decade. The voice cast is fantastic. You can’t go wrong with the Japanese cast or the English cast, due to how they are both chock full of amazing talent. I think the fact that both casts have some big names, but they aren’t flooded by them like some studio work I have seen in the past few years. Christopher Sean and Yuki Yamada do a wonderful job with capturing the angsty, but loving nature of our lead. Gedde Watanabe as Professor Sato is a real scene stealer, and he brings so much love and emotional pain to the role that you forget that he was Ping from Disney’s Mulan. (Well, the 90s Mulan, not the 2020’s version). While he does have some comedic moments as the character, he delivers a heartfelt performance. A real deal scene stealer though is Keone Young, who plays the villain in the movie. I know him from his work in animated offerings, but the fact his character always has some ulterior motive with an immense amount of heartbreak and rage behind the role makes for one of this year’s greatest antagonists. While I wish she had a little more screen time, Tamlyn Tomita is delightful as Mina, who plays a great emotional foil to Sato, and seeing their friendship blossom throughout the film feels genuine, with them forming an actual bond there. The rest of the wonderful cast includes Fumiyo Kohinata, Julia Harriman, Akari Hayami, Lee Shorten, and Takaya Aoyagi. As usual, you can’t go wrong with either cast and version you decide to watch. The music is composed by Scott Blackwell Standford, who has had previous experience in composing for animated art with shorts like Son of Jaguar, Presto, the Lost Ollie mini series, and if you think you are going to get away scott-free of the music pulling at your heart and wanting to make you feel the most visceral emotions during the film’s sweetest moments, you are mistaken. It’s simply going to be mixed in there alongside the songs chosen for the soundtrack, and beats that will make the ground temple as you watch Ultraman charge at the newest threat.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

It honestly felt like a summer anime season where there was a ton of filler, and the good titles were very obvious as to what they would be. Much of the potential in some shows ended up being squandered, and others took too long to get to the actual heart and soul of why you should care. Even some oddities like some titles were not even getting brought over. There were interesting takeaways, whether they be an entire genre regressing since the previous seasonal drop, or remembering that yes, despite how many anime, new and returning are released, there is always something worth watching. That’s the thing, anime will always be a fantastic foundation for storytelling since animation is just so diverse. Even when the anime industry sometimes pumps out the most garbage shows, you will always find something to watch that got the production time, talent, and team to craft a beautiful experience. Overall, I watched 32 shows from the non-returning shows and here are my takeaways.\n\nAnime watched this season and where you can watch them\n\nViral Hit (Crunchyroll)\n\nGo! Go! Loser Ranger (Disney+/Hulu)\n\nMission: Yozakura Family (Hulu)\n\nKaiju No. 8 (Crunchyroll)\n\nWind Breaker (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe Banished Hero Lives as He Pleases (Crunchyroll)\n\nUnnamed Memory (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe New Gate (Crunchyroll)\n\nRe: Monster (Crunchyroll)\n\nI Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince (Crunchyroll)\n\nAn Archdemon’s Dilemma: How to Love Your Elf Bride (Crunchyroll)\n\nChillin in Another World with Level 2 Super Cheat Skills (Crunchyroll)\n\nAs a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I'll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World (Crunchyroll)\n\nYatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose the Lord (Crunchyroll)\n\nStudio Apartment, Good Lighting, Angel Included (Crunchyroll)\n\nGrandma and Grandpa Turn Young Again (Crunchyroll)\n\nSalad Bowl of Eccentrics (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe Many Sides of Voice Actor Radio (Crunchyroll)\n\nAstro Note (Crunchyroll)\n\nThe Fable (Disney/Hulu)\n\nVampire Dormitory (Crunchyroll)\n\nWhisper Me a Love Song (HiDive)\n\nA Condition Called Love (Crunchyroll)\n\nTadaima, Okaeri (Crunchyroll)\n\nHighspeed Etoile (Crunchyroll)\n\nOblivion Battery (Crunchyroll)\n\nTonbo (Amazon Prime)\n\nGods’ Games We Play (Crunchyroll)\n\nMysterious Disappearances (Crunchyroll)\n\nJellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night (HiDive)\n\nTrain to the End of the World (Crunchyroll)\n\nTonari no Youkai-san (Crunchyroll)\n\nTakeaway 1: Isekais/fantasy anime regressed this season!\n\nOne of the first things I noticed with this season is that the isekai/fantasy genre took a rather large step backward in overall quality over last season. Whereas I could list four to five fantasy/isekai shows I loved from the previous season, there aren’t that many here. Some like The New Gate try to have some interesting twists on the formula. It started as a battle royale anime and then quickly shifted into another isekai title in the first episode. That was interesting, but it just didn’t want to explore what it laid out, and that’s a huge issue through most of the fantasy isekai shows this season. Why should I care? The Banished Former Hero Lives as He Pleases is painfully generic with a whole slew of fantasy/isekai tropes smashed together in what might be the cheapest-looking anime of the season. That's saying something due to how there are a few shows that did not get the time and budget they probably wanted, but The Banished Former Hero is very much on the cheap side of things. It also is possibly the worst anime of the season. Re: Monster almost goes an interesting route with our lead being transformed into a goblin and then follows his growth of becoming stronger, but then it introduces more typical power fantasy slop that we have already seen before. Oh, and since it’s an anime with goblins, it has heavily implied elements of goblins kidnapping human women to breed with them because, well, Goblin Slayer became big, and heaven forbid an anime with goblins in it ever be normal. Honestly, Re: Monster is a mediocre version of Reincarnated as a Slime and does everything Slime does, but worse. Heck, it even gives us a reason why our lead has this devouring ability because he was supposedly a cannibal in the past life, which is never really brought up during the show’s story. It’s more in favor of rushing through the progress and getting to the harem stuff than being a good show.\n\nReincarnated as the 7th Prince has vibrant animation, but it doesn’t cover up the more “ick” elements like the older women lusting after a child. It’s frustrating because you can tell the team was having fun with the animation and some aspects of the story, but when you look at everything else, it falls apart. Chilling in Another World with Level 2 Super Cheat Skills has some potentially interesting world-building, like our lead coming from a world that enslaves humanoid beast/ogre people and then comes to a world with an outwardly more progressive world. Sadly, it still goes down the route of typical generic isekai fluff, with a harem, inconsistent and sometimes rough comedy, and results in yet another anime that has the lead chilling, but not really, because they got worried that people would get bored by slice-of-life fantasy shows. Someday, I truly do need to make an editorial talking about isekais needing to get good for once. As a Reincarnated Aristocrat at the very least, while an isekai and has a child character with some of the same issues as Reincarnated as the 7th Prince, has the decency to let our lead’s super powerful ability be passive. Instead of being the most powerful person with no flaws, he finds the best aspects of folks and makes sure they follow those paths. Granted, there are arguments made about why this premise is messed up, but it’s something. An Archfiend’s Dilemma has the unfortunate trope of slavery with its two leads, and while it doesn’t look the best, and so far has some forgettable side characters, the story about two broken folks trying to help each other is a sweet one. Even then though, when there was only one show I found in this category to be good, which was Yatagarasu, then that’s saying something in terms of how terrible this genre was this season. I know some anime fans are mad at how isekai keeps getting turned into a punching bag, but when so many fantasy/isekai shows get released every year, then people are going to be critical of them.\n\nTakeaway 2: Why are we being picky now about what we bring over?\n\nSo, I mentioned back in the last editorial about how companies like Crunchyroll are essentially picking up almost everything under the sun. Well, except they aren’t. Some distributors, now of all times to start, are being picky about bringing over everything. Sure, bring over every isekai slop fest, but we can’t get the presumably charming-looking Girls Band Cry? Why be picky now since Girls Band Cry and Rinkai didn’t get picked up. These distributors will bring over anime based on video games that will frankly shut down in a year unless they are one of the few lucky ones to keep surviving after a year, but are they shows that folks want to see? Yeah, sure I guess it’s hard to know what will get an audience and the only way we can be sure is if we bring it all over, but we aren’t getting every anime every season anyway. Also, why are we being picky with what gets a dub first? I get there is no real rhyme or reason as to when dubs get greenlit or why some of the worst anime of the season get dubs first over the genuinely loved ones, but it would be so much easier to take in some shows when there is a dub to watch. I don’t mind subs or dubs, but the fact some of the more dialogue-driven shows don’t have them over middling isekai garbage is rather odd to say the least.\n\nTakeaway 3: Lots of potential in premises were wasted/underutilized!\n\nDo you know what anime from this season like Unnamed Memory, Oblivion Battery, Gods’ Games We Play, Grandma and Grandpa Turn Young Again, and others have in common? All had premises that could have led to some amazing experiences that then didn’t do anything, or stumbled in the execution department of providing the fully realized vision of what they wanted to bring to the table. At least with Astro Note, you can say why you love or dislike this show, and that will be understandable or be the reason why you love it. Unnamed Memory’s drive is supposedly about the relationship/dynamic of our lead, a prince who needs a curse broken on him by the witch with whom he makes a pact, but their romance is not compelling at all. Mysterious Disappearances has an interesting mystery hook to our author lead and the supernatural horrors that await, but the tone and choice of comedy revolving around our author lead’s figure hurt the overall experience for me. Oblivion Battery is a MAPPA production, so, of course, it has good animation, but the characters are deeply unpleasant to be around. They are obnoxious to a T, and the designs are unappealing. I want to get into the drama between the two baseball players and their broken friendship, but the annoying comedy doesn’t help this show at all. In the end, I wish I liked it more. The Gods’ Games We Play is, simply put, really boring, when an anime about gods forcing humans to play a random set of games should be exciting. Too bad it follows the sin of having characters explain why they are so smart instead of showing us how smart they are. Who cares what happens since they are just going to tell us what happened instead? It’s just a generic-looking anime. We have seen bargain bin designs and visuals so many times and even got compared to the also dreadful Liar Liar from a few seasons ago due to how blah the visuals look. Grandma and Grandpa Turn Young Again might have one of the worst first episodes of any show this season, where it feels like it’s going to be this interesting quirky drama of an old couple turning to young adults again after eating a special apple. It has those moments, but you have to sit through some of the most mediocre comedy of the season, as well as jokes that range from the small chuckle to the very uncomfortable. If it also didn’t have such a lackluster visual look, it would be more tolerable when it does suddenly shift into the more dramatic parts of the story. Tonbo is one of two golf anime that we are getting this year, and while it has a decent enough retro-vibe of a young girl who loves golf and a grizzled mentor who learns how to love golf again, boy howdy, did something happen for the dub to be one of the worst of the decade so far. Also, good luck trying to find info on the dub, because there is no info on who the voice cast is. I normally should be down with a new racing anime after Overtake!, but instead, Highspeed Etoille wastes its premise of futuristic racing with the inclusion of AI racers by making us wait to learn about our leads until the third episode, with mostly dialogue being delivered by side characters, and it’s all wrapped up in ugly CGI animation and overly detailed character designs. Luckily, some shows do come close to feeling more cohesive like Viral Hit with its dark comedy commentary about the issues of bullying and the need to be famous by any means. You know, like a viral hit. It doesn’t feel as cohesive as it should, and its animation and designs are not the most appealing to look at, but it at least has more focus on its premise than other shows in this season.\n\nIt’s always a bummer when you can see the potential of an amazing show that then flounders or takes too long for the payoff to be worthwhile. I know some folks will like the shows I listed in reference here, and that’s fine if ya do, but these are my takeaways. Not gonna lie about how I feel about these shows. Some shows do set up something promising, but the thing is that the creators are not being adventurous or productions aren’t doing enough to make these interesting. Heck, maybe not every story needs to be adapted into anime.\n\nTakeaway 4: As Usual, Good Narratives and Characters Hit Home Runs\n\nAs usual, the best anime of the season doesn’t just have the flashiest animation or is the next big adaptation of a popular series. At its core, every anime that people will love and remember, live and die by their story and characters. Kaiju No. 8 offers a dark comedy spin on the typical hyped series with our lead not only being an actual adult character, but one who can turn into a human kaiju hybrid to battle the giant monstrosities. His motivations are easy to identify with, and his colorful cast of fellow kaiju fighters are fun to see bounce off of one another.\n\nYatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose Its Master is a little dense in the dialogue department, as you venture through this web of fantasy-set political drama and see how the twists and turns unravel in the story and its many interesting players as they reach the cream of the crop on the royalty ladder, portraying what they have to do to get there. I wish it had a dub though, because it would have made it easier to take in everything. Go Go Loser Rangers with its twist of the villains being the rangers that keep the immortal henchmen of the villain organization alive for entertainment is a clever hook on the Power Rangers premise. It's wild how so many anime this season don’t have this clever of a premise or a commitment to the bit that they set up. Following our lead going undercover to take down the rangers from the inside is a lot of fun with compelling characters and biting social commentary. Train to the End of the World offers an enticing mystery to the world that it has created after the world falls under the effects of G7 technology, as we follow a group of girls traversing by train across an unknown world to find their friend. Wind Breaker not only has amazing action animation, but a story of a young man forming a found family/friendship with a group of delinquent boys, who aren’t even bad folks due to how they help out and protect a small town from other gangs. One of the biggest hits of the season was Jellyfish Can’t Swim in the Night, a mind-blowing mature experience,in which we follow a young woman traversing her life in the city chasing the dream and finding her artistic identity with the help of an ex-pop star. While it isn’t the best romance anime of the season, watching the duo in A Condition Called Love work out what they want in a romantic relationship makes for some compelling stuff, even if the lead can sometimes be a creepy individual with what he’s willing to do to be with our other lead. Funny enough, you can completely ignore the Omegaverse stuff with Taidama, Okaeri, because it’s otherwise a lovely little show about a gay couple living in the suburbs trying to live a peaceful and loving life. Whisper Me a Love Song is one of the best girl love romance anime of the year, with its focus on our two leads, a guitarist and her crush. Tonari no Yokai-san offers a low-key slice-of-life experience where humans and yokai live together as they ponder some serious questions like the meaning of life, and finding one’s journey and goals. All of these anime and a few others mentioned throughout this editorial made sure their goal was that they wanted to give you narratively satisfying and compelling shows. If we don’t care about the story or its characters, then why should we bother to watch them? Anime is such an oddity in some ways in the world of animated storytelling with it being unabashedly unafraid to go in weird and compelling directions with the stories they want to tell, and to give you an array of characters to laugh at/with, relate to, and follow.\n\nTakeaway 5: Disney, you have to start advertising the anime you got!\n\nIt plays out more like a sci-fi action thriller than a sci-fi drama like Ad Astra. It has all of the normal traditional sci-fi story beats outside of aliens, but instead of being dower and distant, it’s got more energy and personality in its DNA. Aline Ruby has way more in common with detectives and cops in films like Speed and Die Hard than anything close to someone like Harrison Ford or Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner. She is flawed, and revels in it while also being funny, snarky, bitter, and caring. Carlos isn’t just a cold robot as while his whole identity is being an android, he has anger issues, but still has feelings and cares about his ex-wife and his daughter. It does have its moments where it takes time to look at thematic commentary, but the fact it moves at a faster pace than most keeps it exciting with what they will find out next and have those moments where they show you the eerie unknown of both space and the unknown of things to come with what’s going on with robots becoming more aware and sentient. It’s a sci-fi film that has more fun with itself than most and the action set pieces are all exciting. While the big third-act fight with a bio-organic tank-like thing is similar to the third-act fight in Ghost in the Shell, it feels more action-based with how it not only has our two leads trying to avoid getting killed by it, but also the guards that protect the person who may or may not be in charge of what’s going on. While it plays out like a two-hour thriller, it’s only 85 minutes. It’s amazing how much pacing and compelling characters can make any runtime work.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Not that I worry about the quality, but it’s more about how one should approach talking about these films. Are they canon to the overarching story? Are they disconnected and can be placed at any point in the series’ continuity? Do you go in as a newcomer and want to see a vertical slice of what the franchise has in store for those who haven’t watched it? Do you go in with bias as a fan of the show and just love it because you love the show? Are you or are you not into anime? I always like giving these a chance, no matter if I am a fan of the franchise or not. If I can see them or am given a screener for them, I am going to be fair and judge it as a movie no matter if I have a bias about it or not. You should give every film a chance no matter the familiarity of it or not. Not everyone seems to give every film the same fair shake and that’s a shame. So, what do I think of Spy x Family Code: White?\n\nThis one was one of those franchise films that I had a lot of thoughts going back and forward with how I felt about it. On one hand, it sets out to give us more of the stuff we love about the franchise. It has more Anya antics, more cute moments between Loid and Yor, some sweet action in the third act that is some truly stunning stuff, and it blends it all into the same mix of comedy and action that the series is known for. The whole instigating part of the film’s story is because Anya eats a chocolate bonbon that has some kind of microfilm in it that the villains are looking for. Anya has always been the highlight of the series with her expressive animation and cute antics when she is also with the family dog Bond Forger. While it is more comedy than action, when the action does kick in with the chase sequences, the opening assassin/spy sequence, and the final act that takes place on a giant military airship is truly a sight to behold. It doesn’t take a detour or do anything technically wrong with having the spirit and fun of the main series. If you wanted more Spy x Family, then you got more Spy x Family, and for some, that is what you are going to get and that will be enough. To be clear, whatever I am about to say next does not detract for those simply looking for more Spy x Family. If you wanted more, and that’s it, then that’s fine. Sometimes, we just want to be in the world of a certain show or film again.\n\nSo, why does this film not work for me at points? I think it’s because while it’s more of the series we love, part of it suffers from the fact that this is the director’s first time directing a feature film, and by the end of the film’s runtime, it feels like a longer three-part episode arc of the TV show. The thing that sets up the first half of the film is yet another plot where Yor sees Loid with another character in the show and thinks that he is being unfaithful to her, and that is what drives the first half of the film until the actions from Anya’s mishap with the chocolate and microfilm take over. It doesn’t feel as grand in scale for a film experience. Sure, not every film needs to be big and feel big. Some of my favorite films are small-scale experiences. With that said, if you are making a film, you want it to feel grandiose and different from the show, so it doesn’t feel like you are simply watching a longer TV episode on the big screen. It is also a shame that Yor’s insecurity and going through yet another misunderstanding plot line, since Yor got the short end of the stick in the series until the recent season on the cruise ship where she was able to shine and have a story for herself. It’s part of the problem with this not having any real connection to the TV series, since none of this will matter in the show’s story. Heck, they could technically take the Lupin III approach and have films/specials that take place whenever they want them to, since they are taking their time with going through the main story, but for now, the fact any of this won’t help the main story is a little disappointing. It’s weird how much my mind kept flip-flopping back and forward with this film, because the stuff I saw was fun. After all, this world and its characters are likable. It reminds me a lot of the Konosuba film where I liked a majority of the film despite it not feeling as film-like as it could have. The villain is okay as he fits into the world of the franchise, but he is just an evil military general and his two henchmen are way more memorable. It even introduces a late-game special henchman that comes right out of a Resident Evil game, but they will be forgiven for this addition, because as I said previously, the action scene between this guy and Yor is amazing. When we finally get to the second half of the story and we get past the annoying misunderstanding plot, the film finds its pace again and feels like a grand adventure for the Forgers.\n\nThe animation is also another part of this film where it has me going back and forward with how I felt about it. The collaboration between Wit Studios and CloverWorks has resulted in a visually splendid series, and has a lot of the usual eccentric animation for characters like Anya who is always a barrel of laughs and has unique facial expressions. With that said, the film doesn’t look any different than the show. It’s not a big enough visual upgrade until we get to the CGI that looks better for the film than the show, but it would have been nice to see this get a slightly nicer visual upgrade, so it doesn’t just look like the show. Well, to be fair, there is one sequence where Anya needs to go to the bathroom and the henchmen think she will expel the microfilm, and the sequence of Anya trying to hold it all in leads to a rather trippy visual moment, and it makes an elongated poop joke funny. If you are going to be absurd with your comedy, then you have to go all the way with stuff like this, because otherwise, folks will just scowl at poop jokes. Even the recurring gag of one of the henchmen using superstitions to help them on their way to get Anya is funny. The voice cast is also delightful with Alex Organ, Megan Shipman, Natalie Van Sistine, and Tyler Walker who plays Bond Forger are great as the titular family. Phil Parsons and Tyson Rinehart are great as our bumbling henchman, and John Swasey plays our villain Snijder with an unlikable air with some great comedic moments for him as well. The music is solid enough, but you are probably only going to remember the great song crafted by Official Hige Dandism, who did the first theme song for the show. Not that Makoto Miyazaki aka (K)now Name’s music wasn’t good, but it just felt like it was more of the same that we got in the show’s score.\n\nWhy These?: While Animation is Film is one of the most beautiful ways to see a fantastic world of art that anyone can get into and hopefully partake in, the fact is that they are going to choose what they can and will only pick out the best of the best for this festival. A Boat in the Garden is by the famed director Jean Francois Laguionie, but his previous film didn’t show up at Animation is Film so it’s a real 50/50 chance that it may or may not be. Flow from Gints Zilbalodis who made the Annecy-winning Away could make it, but since Flow didn’t make it to Animation is Film 2019, who knows if this one will as well. Sometimes South Korean animation shows up at Animation is Film, but it’s not frequent and Gill could make it, depending on the reception it gets at Annecy. The Glassworker might get some push due to how it’s Pakistan’s first 2D animated film and that would be fun to see and receive the support it could get. It depends on what the reception and where they would put it in the runtime. As for the big studio previews, we know they will have a preview for Moana 2, because Disney always has an animated film preview there at the festival. I know The Wild Robot is probably coming out at the end of September, but do we even think that’s gonna happen? This film’s trailer was one of the biggest hits of the year, and yet I feel like it might get pushed back into November/December due to the animation strike, if studios decided to play stupid again like they did last year. But if that happens, we could see a preview of it. We might see a preview of Elio from Pixar. I don’t think we will, but who knows? The Umbrella Fairy is one of the newest animated films from China and it has some stylish visuals that look amazing, but with how random and inconsistent the US distributors are with bringing over films from China, who knows if we will get this one.\n\nWith all that said, there is the possible chance that simply put, this could just be another incidence of something not working out. While a lot of the issues can be traced back to the executive level, and how companies like Netflix are shifting gears by going less art-driven with the shows and films they make, and more of what will grab the widest audience, sometimes, projects fall through the cracks. I could be very wrong about how this is a scheme by studios to not give animators and creatives ammunition for the upcoming animation strike. Sometimes, a project just needs more time or something doesn’t work out, but even then, it’s hard not to know how the animation strike is happening this year, and think the studios are getting out in front of the strike by cutting off their nose to spite their face. It’s a maddening time, and while some are taking the current landscape as a means to keep strengthening themselves and not get bogged down by it, there is a limit to how optimistic you can be in an industry that is in a weird stilted place right now, from what it sounds like. Either way, no matter what happens, do not let the studios get away with their antics this year and support the animation strike. Hopefully, the studios will wise up and give the animation guild and everyone who makes the shows and films for them the deal they deserve, and stop trying to save a dollar for everything due to the incompetent CEOs of the studios not being able to control their budgets. People who work in animation get dunked on at all times and get the short end of the stick of what gets written off for tax reasons or who gets their projects canceled first. We need to be there for the animators, artists, writers, and everyone in between who works in animation this year, like how we were all there for the writers and actors during their strike last year. If you truly believe animation is cinema and deserves to be respected, then we need to make sure the people who are making it get a fair deal, and let creatives like Jorge make their art.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

On the one hand, we got one of the highest-grossing foreign animated films with The Boy and the Heron. On the other hand, we also got Disney with one of their worst-performing years in history and their big 100-year celebration film Wish underperforming at the box office. It was a changing of the guards, a real case of the tides changing, and that needed to happen. Not one studio can or should be on top all the time, and with filmgoing becoming more expensive, large film releases feel less special than ever before. How nostalgia and IP are no longer safe bets, we are seeing a sudden rough shift and it’s going to get bumpy. With all that said, there are still going to be great movies made and released during this time. 2023 had a lot of fantastic animated movies, and I wish I could put them all in my top 10, but these were my favorites of last year. Honorary mentions go to The First Slam Dunk, The Inventor, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and Elemental.\n\n10. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

More animated films from Japan are now getting released in theaters and it’s nice to see, because back in the day, you could only dream that an animated film could make it onto the big screen and not be sent directly to DVD. Unless you were Pokemon, Studio Ghibli, or the random festival darling, you never got to see Japan’s animated experiences on the big screen in the States. Obviously, due to the increased popularity of anime and the “demand” for more of it to the point that it’s killing its industry, you get to see a varied batch of animated films on the biggest screen possible. Of course, most are only showing up for the action franchises that have the biggest audience, and that’s a shame, because you could very much show that same support for your favorite films from anime franchises to either new original projects or lesser-known series getting the theatrical treatment. I’m extremely happy for everyone who showed up for The Boy and the Heron because it shows there is an audience that craves those cinematic animated experiences from Japan. Still, it is disheartening to know those folks will not show up for other original anime films or non-franchise stuff, because when you explore outside of that realm and be a little more adventurous, you can find stuff that you may not have known about or wanted. For example, something like The Concierge.\n\nThe real bitter part of this film is how it's structured. Technically, there is nothing wrong with it being set up with the story being a bunch of smaller stories that reach the 70-minute mark. It means that you will either love or dislike this more slice-of-life approach. It makes sense that it's set up like that due to the writer previously working on Fortune Favors Lady Nikkuko, which was also a film mostly held together by vignettes and amazing animation.With that format, it leaves a lot of characters to feel one-note and forgettable. There are some likable characters, and the touching moments work with how we cherish memories and the ones that are close to us. Something is appealing about a film that is all about being the best that you can be and bringing joy to someone you helped make their day. However, the more impactful moments would have worked more if there was, simply put, more time to let the story breathe, letting our main character bond and interact more with other characters or letting the side characters breathe. This film probably should have ironed out some of the story beat problems by being 90 minutes. Sure, the source material is only two volumes, but the film didn’t need to speed through everything and then halt the story to have a third-act conflict show up abruptly, or have some story moments resolve themselves fairly quickly with some last-minute saves. Again, this world where endangered or extinct animals shop at this giant luxury store is a fun concept where you can also talk about environmentalism and how humans have wiped entire species off the face of the earth. There is just not enough time to engross yourself or learn more about the characters.\n\nThe fact I want more out of this not only because it would help flesh out everything, but because I love the world they craft, it is a good thing. What we get is a film that has a lot of great ideas, but no time to explore them to the extent that they probably could. The cast is made of characters who have one character trait and not much else. Some characters pop in to be introduced, only to show up one other time. Still, our lead Akino is bubbly and always ready to do what she can, even under pressure to perform well from the mysterious individual grading how she is doing. The “villain” doesn’t have much to him outside of being the employer, and is more of a road bump that is easily solved by the customers that our lead has helped out throughout the entire runtime. Some of the best moments are when Akino is helping out certain animal customers, like a mammoth who is a famous sculpture artist, a father and daughter ferret duo who want to get each other a present after not seeing each other for a while, and a Japanese Wolf who is trying to marry/court another Japanese Wolf. When it delves into the store's future and what kind of impression/legacy the owner wants everyone to associate it with, it was, to me, the weaker half of the film. I don’t recall why so many films in the theatrical animation scene recently feel like they have to rush to get to their next story beat. Let filmgoers chill and enjoy the worlds in which you are inviting them. Who knows, maybe they didn’t have the budget to make it longer, and or something happened during the production pipeline where they chose the vignettes as the focus rather than having a more cohesive and deeper plot. Or maybe it was just tough to make a film based on this property.\n\nThe animation is wonderful. The team at Production I.G. tends to put out some amazing work and it’s no different here. The characters feel so lively, the colors are vibrant and make the whole world pop, and due to the more simplistic designs and line work, the characters get to be more expressive than others with more restrictive designs. They squash, stretch, and have so many surprising expressions when they are reacting in a big way. The designs are also just wonderful and identifiable of what each animal is, and what type of person each character is in terms of who they were with a personality. It shows that you don’t need to go full-on MAPPA with the animation to make a good-looking animation. More detail doesn’t always mean the end product is going to be better. It just means more work. The store itself is also just grand in the scale of it. Even before we see how truly big it is, you can just see how large this place is. Not just having multiple specialty stores, but also a full-blown restaurant that serves vegan dishes. That part was honestly a nice little world-building detail, since when you are introduced to the dining experience, it makes you think about how this world would work with humans helping out animals at this department store. I also love all the little details, like how the guy watching over our lead will pop up from out of nowhere or from small compartments to make sure she knows something important about being helpful. With the energetic animation, quirky characters, and heartfelt themes, the overall presentation is just a lot of fun to watch.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this review!)\n\nAs I have watched and reviewed over 300 movies, it makes me feel grateful to be able to see so much amazing art being made by some of the best talent behind the animation scene. So many amazing folks, whether they are from the bottom to the top of the production team, pour their hearts and souls into these films. While sometimes it doesn’t work out due to whatever happens in production, when we do see something fly high in the sky, and it reaches the goals that it sets out to complete, it’s a marvel that there are so many amazing films made by the hands of real human artists. In the current battle of what’s going on with the animation industry here in the States and in places like Japan trying to replace animators with AI and cheaper alternatives, it means that we have to fight to make sure we don’t lose out on other amazing artists that can take their paths to create amazing work. We should all be thankful we live in a world where Hayao Miyazaki can come out of retirement and craft an Oscar-winning experience like The Boy and the Heron.\n\nSo, the original movie’s title was How Do You Live? It means the movie is in the tradition of most Ghibli adaptations, loosely based on the source material. I remember reading folks being mad at the name change, but it’s more or less a homage to The King and the Mockingbird, the animated film that inspired Hayao Miyazaki. Even then, the original title itself shows up in The Boy and the Heron as a book that Mahito’s mom had. This movie has been considered one of the heavier and harder to get into of Miyazaki’s flicks, due to how it isn’t as “open” and “friendly” to the viewers of this world and story. I love Hayao Miyazaki’s work, and while I do see some of those complaints in this movie, I think letting the film sit in your mind to think about more, or going to see it again (if you can), does open up to be a more complex story about how one lives life. It’s interesting to note that Miyazaki named the film this title, because he didn’t have an answer to the question itself. He takes some biographical elements, as well as some homages to his previous work, and crafts a beautiful story about a boy discovering how he is supposed to live. Should he give up after his mother died? Should he take up the mantle of the wizard in the film voiced by Mark Hamill and bring balance to the world? Should he let go of the past and keep moving forward down his path? How does one keep living in a world full of strife and pain? It’s more philosophical with how Miyazaki framed this film’s story. Mahito struggles to find a way to create a world with no conflict when that isn’t possible, and feels like he has to take up the mantle of the previous generation’s work. What it boils down to is that you do what you need to and find your way to craft your own story. Life is messy and complicated. He also weaves in elements and commentary about nature, war, and how pride can destroy one’s self, as we see later on when one character ruins the world due to his actions. It has some dream and fairy tale logic to explain parts of its story, but why would anyone want an animated film to be as realistic as possible? Realism can be boring, and the demand for more “realistic” stories and writing is what gave us those awful Disney live-action remakes.\n\nDo we even need to say how good the animation is for The Boy and the Heron? It’s Studio Ghibli! They tend to put out some of the best and most visually distinct animations in the overall industry. The beginning scene where the city is covered in flames is aggressive and violent. We see the visuals get rough and ragged as Mahito tries to run past the crowds to get to his mother. The countryside is emblematic and peaceful, the ocean shores are calm and filled with an ominous and mysterious tone from the cave on the shoreline, the parakeet city is bustling and filled to the brim with the monstrous bird folk, the garden found in the granduncle’s realm is lush and full of life, and the small home that the mysterious fire girl named Lady Himi is cozy and really homey. I mean, it’s a little cottage home, so it should be. There are too many amazing scenes to count where the animation just oozes with passion from the opening fire scene, the warawara floating up into the sky to become living beings, the first time Himi meets Mahito, the sequence where the Parakeet King and Granduncle walk and talk while the score for The Great Collapse plays, the multiple encounters and scenes with the Grey Heron, and you get the idea. The character chemistry between the major players of the story is fascinating. There is an uneven alliance between Mahito and the Heron that starts off antagonistic, but the journey they take together leads to some great moments that are also fairly funny. Despite its more philosophical tone at times, some comedic moments are more subtle than bombastic in the punchlines. Mahito’s animation is the most subtle of the bunch as his face generally defaults to one expression of a stoic closed-off individual, but the animators make tweaks as to how he reacts to everything once he begins to open up to the world around him and the people he meets. Instead of Mahito saying his change in worldview, the animation illustrates it perfectly. The Grey Heron is such an odd and out-there design with a small Danny Devito-looking weirdo inside a magical bird suit that sometimes when not in use, shows the human’s head and hands could come off distracting, but doesn’t. The parakeets were a fan favorite design from the screenings I went to, with how adorable they look, but how vicious they truly are works off of their fluffy looks with flying colors.\n\nIt was nice to see Miyazaki come back to a more fantastical world after he did The Wind Rises, which still had incredible animation and fantastical sequences, but they were few and far between compared to this one where it’s more 50/50 with the film taking place in both the real world and the fantasy world. Even the maids at the mansion each have their own quirky walk cycle, where you see who they are as characters just by looking at them. The music. Where to even start with Joe Hisaishi’s newest composition with some of the most elegant and mesmerizing tunes? If I had to pick a favorite song from last year from any movie, it would have to be The Great Collapse which plays near the end of the film. The combination of piano and stringed instruments makes my heart swoon as I feel myself carried away by its bountiful melody. Oh, and the theme song that plays at the end, Spinning Globe by famed artist Kenshi Yonezu is another whimsical display of beauty that caps us off on another Ghibli journey and one that was a long time coming. The voice cast is also the cat’s pajamas. English dubs for Ghibli films tend to be some of the best dubs around, and the celebrities they got this time around make for one of the more stacked casts in animation from 2023. Luca Padovan, Karen Fukuhara, Florence Pugh, Mark Hamill, Dave Bautista, Gemma Chan, Dan Stevens, Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Barbra Goodson, Tony Revolori, Mamoudou Athie, and of course, Robert Pattinson as the titular bird. Hearing who is usually a pretty chill-looking guy go full-on gremlin mode with his performance shows how ready and excited he was to do some voice work for a Ghibli film. You don’t even get that it’s him most of the time, and instead, see the pathetic broken bird man that Mahito has to put up with. Some of the actors were more noticeable than others in their performances, but the acting was exquisite. If there was a best acting moment in the entire movie, it would have to be when Luca Padovan and Karen Fukuhara’s Mahito and Himi have to say goodbye to one another, and even though Himi is going to be going into her time period where she will end up perishing, she is okay with it because of how she gets to become Mahito’s mom. That scene alone still breaks me every time I think about it.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this review!)\n\nWhen it comes to the festival circuit that takes place during the first three quarters of the year, so many films begin their salmon-like journey through the festival scene, and when normal folks finally get to see the film, you don’t quite know how anyone and everyone reacts. Reviewing films during a festival run at one of the major festivals sets you up with a different vibe than seeing the film in a normal theatrical viewing experience. You have high expectations that a lot of movies are going to be all classics and new masterpieces in the making. Well, while a lot of good movies come through the festival circuit, sometimes the hype isn’t worth it, and some films are, simply put, not good. It becomes this “tournament of champions” style elimination bracket of what film goes through the festival circuit and gets more and more hype or suffers the consequences of being released to the public and dying on the vine. Some films enter the theater scene after one festival release, and sometimes that works. It’s up in the air as to what is going to connect with critics and audience goers. Sometimes it is obvious, but when you get down to the finals of the film festival journey, you find something so special and distinct that it not only hits it out of the park, but hits you in the deepest part of your emotions and soul. That’s how I felt with Robot Dreams.\n\nIt starts us off with how lonely our main character is and how everyone yearns for the need for friendship and connection. Once we see the friendship form between the robot and the dog, we watch how connected they become. When we get to the middle part of the film, we start to see the reality of how many friendships unfold as our two leads are separated from one another. While that bond may be there, the distance with which they are separated becomes bigger. They start to grow disconnected, and move on to new friendships and bonds. For a film with such an unassuming art style that many will probably find “childish” and “simple”, it is anything but that. With no dialogue and a 102-minute runtime, we have a movie that is more in-depth and complex than most live-action films that come out of the film industry. It hones in on the most important details about relationships, and uses those bits to bring in some emotionally powerful moments. The moment you pick up that something has changed in the vibe of the relationships is truly when the film shines, and how sad yet poetic and beautiful the journey of connection can be. That’s a good way to describe this film, it’s sad, but it’s also beautifully poetic. It might be more art-driven with how it tells its story and will have some very abstract and heartbreaking moments, but it is by far and away one of the most recent films that talks about a highly universal and incredibly relatable part of life. Most films wish they could capture the emotional depth this film has with its story about a dog and robot’s friendship.\n\nThe animation is quite pleasant to look at. It has a case of more modern animation approaches with the round designs, but that doesn’t really matter. Animation fans need to indulge and embrace different art styles, and cease wanting everyone to do what Richard Williams did with his work in animation. The art style doesn’t hold back the tone or mood for which the film is going. It is playful and it is fluid in its animation. It has personality in each of the designs. A goal to keep in mind with character design is that you can tell what the character is doing or what their character is all about through their design and movements. Luckily, this film passes with flying colors in that department, due to how it isn’t held back by dialogue and voice work. You get everything you need to know about our two leads, and even the background characters are full of life and personality in their designs. The music is fantastic with a wonderful score by Alfonso De Villaonga that captures New York in such stunning accuracy with its composition. With all that said, the way the film uses Earth Wind and Fire’s September in two very different points makes the emotional core of this film even more effective. It can be such an upbeat song, but you then listen to the lyrics, and how it's used at the end makes for one of the most perfect scenes from any film from last year. If you can find any interviews with the director, he talked about this when I saw this film at Animation is Film and he was such a swell guy.\n\nOne of the things you need to seriously understand is that a lot of the cool 2D animated stuff coming out of the rest of the world takes a very long time to come out here. You might say that didn’t stop Disney during the 90s, but Disney was essentially working on two films at around the same time, and when one was done, they would be on their way to greenlighting another one or beginning the production of another one. They also had a small army of animators and studios full of talented and trained 2D animators. These days, while there are small indie studios and plenty of folks who can do 2D animation, we are simply not in the same spot as we were in the 90s and 2000s. There is a reason why so many of these productions have a handful of production company logos in front of the movie, why some of them are collaborations between two different countries, and why you will see a pitch for the film, and then nothing about it for years until they just pop up out of the blue at Annecy and hopefully, Animation is Film and other festivals. It makes being hyped for these films difficult, when you don’t exactly know how long it’s gonna take to get these films made or if they get made at all. It’s a shame, because then you see that the film is now finished and yet you may not have a way to see it unless you go to the festival where it’s playing. A fantastic example of this kind of film that takes a good long while to get made and then becomes tough to see is a film I have been waiting for and following for years, Kensuke’s Kingdom.\n\nReview: The follow-up to the previous film by directors Marya Zarif and Andre Kadi We now have Dounia living in a small town in Canada, where she learns about new cultures and hopes for her father to be safe and to see him again. While it feels like three plots from a nonexistent TV series put together, and it’s shorter than the previous film clocking in at under an hour, it’s a solid follow-up. It’s a cozy experience as the story commendably talks about how we might have different cultures, but we can come together to be friends with one another. Kudos to the film for having three different languages as well and not feeling like it needed to talk down to its audience about the situation that is going on in the world. It might not rock your world, but there is something admirable about a film that introduces a lot of concepts like the ones seen in this film to a young audience. We need more films aimed at young audiences to do that. Kids can handle a certain amount of topical subject matter without having to not talk about it or dumb it down to a nauseating degree. Dounia continues to be this adorable film series that I hope keeps getting better as they make more of them.\n\nThere is always going to be discourse around what we can and can’t show to kids and how children’s media should be talking up and not down to their audience. It’s a tricky balance since some kids will want to see The Super Mario Movie and love it over something that could be considered more intense like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. It’s always going to be a kid-by-kid basis with what they can or can’t handle. If they can handle more than they are usually given, then let them watch some of the heavier stuff, but there needs to be films and shows made for everyone and every type of kid. Some may want zany action. Some may want something more laid-back and chill. Some may even want an animated film that talks about headier topics that they want to know at a young age. Some films and shows can balance out the experience, and all that the films and shows need to do is, when they are crafting the experience, to not talk down to the audience. It just shows that even with these three films aimed at younger audiences, there is still something fun and respectable about them, due to what they bring to the table. If you can find a way for your kids to see these films and want to start them on their love for animation journey, then give these a try.\n\n(If you like what you see, you can go to camseyeview.biz to see more of my work on video game reviews, editorials, lists, Kickstarters, developer interviews, and review/talk about animated films.

Thanks for checking out my work, and I hope you enjoy this review!)\n\nI have been partaking in the New York International Children’s Film Festival right now, and many of the films will be up for the review lineup. Boy howdy, do we have a slew of animated features that show how creative and vast the animation landscape can be. There was a notion among animation fans that more detailed character designs and animation meant it would objectively be better than something more simple or abstract. That is simply not the case, since one thing animation fans don’t seem to get is that more detail doesn’t instantly mean better quality. With how vibrant you can be with the medium of storytelling, why would you think there should be only one way for a film to look or tell its story? One of the most visually stunning films was 2017’s The Girl Without Hands by Sébastien Laudenbach. The incredible visuals for that film were able to tell you everything while looking minimalist. It helped tell the dark Grimms-style fairytale, and that stood out more than some films with intricate designs that take forever to animate. It’s not 100% better, but it completes its goal with flying colors. Well, lucky for us, Sébastien is back with director Chiara Malta with their newest film, Chicken for Linda.\n\nWhen describing this film about a mother and daughter trying to get a chicken and how antics unravel, it sounds like a terrible 90s family film that we got back then where they were insulting and obnoxious to the audience that went to see them. Thankfully, this is not the case here. Sure, it sounds silly and it can be fairly comedic with the dialogue, musical numbers, and sequences of trying to kill the chicken itself. With all that said, the film is not truly about the chicken. Like, it is about making the chicken dish, but it’s not really about the chicken dish. It’s more about what the chicken dish means to Linda. A dish can just be a dish, but the memories attached to a certain dish are what matters, and that is where we are with Linda. Other than this dish, she doesn’t have any memories of her father before he passed away. It’s the same thing for Paulette and the ring. It’s not just a fancy ring that she wanted to wear to go out for a night on the town. It’s the ring that her husband gave her, and she didn’t want it to be taken anywhere. The film has multiple dramatic layers under all the character interactions. Whether it be the kids working together to get the ingredients to help make the dish, the tension with the officer trying to do his job and failing to understand the misunderstandings, the delivery driver and the mother, and the background strike going on and how it visually parallels with what happens at the apartment complex/neighborhood in which the majority of the film takes place. The way the film handles the metaphorical idea of memories and what they represent gives this film a complex in-depth view on life and how something as simple as a chicken and pepper dish can bring people together. This is the power of animated storytelling, where you can take such a simple premise and make it as complex as the most endearing drama. It also helps that its comedy is more subdued, with some old-school physical comedy and dialogue bits that come from all of the different characters as they grow and change or even bond during the film. This film finds a way to make familial drama captivating and engaging. Whether it's between the two adult sisters or the children trying to capture the chicken, or how the other adults react to the situation, it’s a movie with more substance than most award-season flicks.\n\nOnce again, the director returns with the same visual style that he used in his previous film with this one. The painted line work and empty designs lead to striking visuals, and the way the animators use the line work to express emotions and the mood of the film. Everyone has a distinct color, and when the film wants to express something like say, breathing, the lines thin out and then become thicker. The contrast between colors, the chicken looking like a little ball of lines from afar, and the downright gorgeous shots of how they tackle what memories look like inside our minds make this one of the prime examples of animation being a wonder and miracle of a medium for storytelling. You could probably try to make this film in live-action, but even the most pristine shot compositions of this story would look less than what we have here. The acting gets a passing grade all around. I love the grounded dialogue and the chemistry between the actors. They act like they all have a history with one another. Clotilde Hesme as Paulette and Melinee Leclrec as Linda have some great back and forth interactions, and feel like a real deal mother and daughter. You only get connections like this from certain directors like Chris Sanders, who can capture that feeling of a mother-daughter bond. The overall soundtrack composed by Clement Ducol is very vibe-heavy and it works due to how it perfectly fits the mood of the scene from the quiet and somber tunes when Linda and Paulette are reconciling with each other to the more antic-driven chase to get the chicken. The musical numbers do a good job getting into the head spaces of certain characters, but I would say they are the weakest part of the overall movie. Still, you will get a laugh at the one based around candy and the stress Paulette’s sister has about her antics.\n\nSomething I noticed this season was that I wasn’t finding myself as frustrated or constantly disappointed with the shows I was checking out. Even the more middling experiences had something of note that made them more interesting than most. The Undead Unwanted Adventurer, while needing more time to cook, was a compelling beginning with our hero being revived as a skeleton after a horrific dragon attack in a dungeon. The Strongest Tank takes from the genre of fantasy shows where someone with a specific class from RPGs is seen as inferior, and while I like the base dynamic of our lead’s bond with his sister, these types of shows dive way too much into the harem genre that quickly derails them, and the fact the supposed harem looks to be of young girls is not helping the matter. But the fact our lead was a more defensive character was something we don’t often see with these shows. Too bad the reasoning behind their departure from the hero’s party is never as captivating as the premise should be. Delusional Monthly Magazine was a wild swing-and-miss original property that feels like it could quite pick between being the life of a weird monthly magazine or some globetrotting supernatural adventure. Fluffy Paradise may have been basic and more low-key with its focus on a lead who got turned into a child in a fantasy world, but the fact it captures the love and feeling of just wanting to cuddle and chill with friendly animals makes for an appealing if not urgent watch. Sasaaki and Peeps has a ton of different hooks, such as having an adult male lead obtain a pet bird who happens to be a magical wizard. It is also an odd isekai premise where our lead can traverse between two worlds and then gets enrolled with helping to take down psychics. It is an original idea, but your mileage will vary depending on how much you feel invested with this combination of things. Dr Elise is another isekai where our lead has been reincarnated in a different world multiple times and goes from the real world to the fantasy world once more, and just so happens to be a skilled medic. The show plants an interesting seed of a premise, but doesn’t quite make the landing with the world and character being as compelling as they need to be. Chained Soldier and Tales of the Wedding Rings offer mix-ups with their takes on the fantasy worlds in which they pull us. Tales of the Wedding Rings falls apart due to the harem element taking center stage, leaving the writing and animation to take a hit. With its writing and building up character relationships as our lead is sent on a quest to get a harem due to magic reasons to protect the kingdom, it at least has more going on under the hood than others. Chained Soldier has a mix of action, harem, and ecchi elements with a world where women gain powers to take down monsters, and sexual shenanigans happen on the side. It at least put in the footwork to make the male lead likable, and the dynamics with the women he is staying with are likable enough to not make it just a show where the viewer has to sit through the creative's BDSM fetish. If you can walk away and say “Hey, I didn’t vibe with it, but I admire what it was doing” then that’s better than walking away feeling like you earned nothing through the experience. Even then…\n\nTakeaway #3: Despite the bloat, some titles are still surprising!\n\nI always love to be surprised by the shows we watch, and I am always going to be down with shows that catch me off-guard with how much I enjoy them. Although it came out a tad late during the seasonal drop, Bang Brave Bravern is a callback to old-school mecha anime, with all of the world-building and political asides mixed with giant robot action and very homoerotic overtones that make for a charming series with some stellar action. The Witch and the Beast offers up a supernatural buddy-cop dynamic between a mage and a woman who must track down the witch who cursed her. We get some stellar action and captivating mysteries as we finally have a killer fantastical mystery anime that I haven't seen since the summer season last year with Undead Murder Farce. Metallic Rogue is an original anime from Studio Bones, with a cool sci-fi dystopian action show that may be light on the exposition, but heavy on the vibes, likable leads, and killer action. Tis Time for Torture offers a comedic take on a demon general trying to interrogate a princess about her kingdom’s secrets using delicious-looking food and video games to force her to crack under pressure. Mr Villain’s Day Off captures the relatability of trying to have a day off, even when you are a general in an evil army that is constantly at battle with a Power Rangers-like group of heroes. All he wants is to not deal with coworkers, and enjoy time looking at the panda at the zoo. Romance anime gave us a trio of three hits with A Sign of Affection being the best one of the bunch, as we follow the romantic tension between a deaf woman and a guy who wants to be a part of her world. It’s such an endearing and lovable series that shows us the world from her perspective which makes for a heartwarming romantic experience. If you are starving for something similar to My New Boss is Goofy, the more Yaoi-focused Cherry Magic! has a goofy little premise of our lead gaining mind-reading powers due to turning 30 as a virgin, but his dynamic with his coworker who has a crush on our lead is heartfelt, spicy, and is a good follow-up for those that loved My New Boss is Goofy. While the Demon Prince of Momochi House is a bit melodramatic and takes some time to wind up its mystery of the mansion, its inhabitants, and the romance between our leads, the visuals and chemistry between our two leads result in a real solid romance anime. No matter the number of shows released, we tend to get a lot of good ones, but with that said how many anime we get…\n\nTakeaway #4: Why did we get Snack Basue and Gushing Over Magical Girls?\n\nEven though anime companies are willing to sell the rights to every new show during every seasonal drop, we still don’t get every title. It’s funny, because every once in a while, there will be an anime from random seasonal drops that just don’t show up until either way later on some streaming service, or just gets pirated online with folks crafting fan subs for them. Now, to some degree, I get it. Why bring over an anime that may or may not be attached to a show or property that is big or at least more well-known in Japan than the States and why would they think it would do well here? But that seems to be an even smaller case that barely happens. Still, no one can watch all of these shows, especially when you have a total of 50+ shows at times, and it feels like a shotgun approach is taken these days. Bringing over anything and everything no matter if it looks appealing or has any chance of being a hit can be a hit-or-miss propostion. So why do we get titles like Snack Basue, which has no real wide appeal, absurdly cheap-looking animation, and is about a nightlife culture that most fans and viewers aren’t going to know about? I should love this zany weird comedy, but something either doesn’t and won’t translate to an audience not familiar with the style of comedy they are going for, and with the bad animation, the jokes don’t land as well as they should. Gushing Over Magical Girls I can understand a bit more, since everyone loves a good magical girl deconstruction, but when a lot of it is based around BDSM fetish with middle school-aged characters that becomes fairly explicit, it makes you wonder who this is for outside of a very questionable group of folks who would enjoy this type of show. We don’t get Pon no Michi, a show about a group of girls running a mahjong parlor, but we get these two that have a way smaller viewer base. It just makes you wonder where the priorities are, and prompts a discussion about the point of ecchi anime or anime that borderlines on pornography or much more problematic stuff, but that’s a topic for another time. For now, another takeaway I had was…\n\nTakeaway #5: So much violence!\n\nSomething that I noticed between shows like Solo Leveling, Ishura, Sengoku Youko, and Meiji Gekken: 1874 was that the blood and violence levels were higher than usual. Not that they were all at the levels of"
