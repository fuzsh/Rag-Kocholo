        "text": "A timeline documenting Peter Parker’s 14 years as Spider-Man employing a floating timeline (sliding timescale) up to 2014\n\n[The following is guest post from friend of the site Anthony Lieu. Enjoy!]\n\nHey there, True Believers. You might remember a couple of months ago, I released the X-Men Film Timeline.\n\nIn celebration of Spider-Man’s 52nd Anniversary, I decided to build a timeline to document Peter Parker’s 14 years as Spider-Man. I’ve spent the last few months reading literally hundreds and hundreds of comics so that I could make this as accurate as possible. Unfortunately, this is going to be a wall of plain text before I get the opportunity to do something on imgur. I kept on finding more and more events to include in the timeline, and it just sort of spiraled out of control! I will lay out some of my headcanon before hand, and hopefully you all enjoy!\n\nPeter Parker/Spider-Man’s birthday will be considered August 10th, 1985 (for the purposes of the timeline). His debut, Amazing Fantasy #15, was released on August 10th, 1962. This will give us a frame of reference for Peter’s age, and from the details we have been given, it’s very likely Peter has a summer birthday. Amazing Spider-Man (Vol 1 – 3) will be the main reference for details as the longest running Spider-Man title.\n\nMidtown High is a fictional high school, but it’s definitely located in Forest Hills, Queens, New York. With this in mind, the school calendars for Bayside High and Forest Hills High let school out at the end of June and start back up in September. I will also take this time to explain that it is a fact that Empire State University is based off of New York University. Keeping that in mind, the Spring Semester usually ends in May, graduations in May, and Fall Semester beginning in September. This acted as a guideline for where certain issues took place.\n\nNow, to get us started off, Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 #1 (published June 2014, and taking place during Late April 2014) establishes that Peter has been Spidey for 13 years. While this fits well with Marvel Time (where every 4 years in the real world equals 1 year in comics, so 13 x 4 = 52. 1952 + 52 + 2014), it causes problems with Spidey’s earlier years because of milestones such as graduations. So, the way we fix it is that we use Marvel Time for the later years the best we can, while also staying true to the fixed points in Spider-Man’s life.\n\nHere we go. – Anthony L.\n\nAugust 10th, 1985 – Peter Parker is born.\n\nSpring 1992 – 6 year old Peter Parker is left orphaned when the airplane that CIA Agents Richard and Mary Parker are on explodes mid-flight.

The Kingpin uses Mentallo’s perception altering abilities to make it seem as if Peter Parker really has a younger sister in CIA Agent Teresa Parker. In the end, it is revealed the Mentallo’s powers were altering both Peter and Teresa’s perceptions, and Teresa was really just CIA Agent Teresa Durand. A DNA sample of Teresa’s saliva taken earlier in the story by Emile Chigaru (the mission controller for The Parkers) make it seem plausible that Teresa might actually be related to Peter in some way. It is of note that in the end flashback of the story, Mary Parker does reveal to Richard Parker that she is pregnant, but the gender, identity, and fate of the baby is unknown.
