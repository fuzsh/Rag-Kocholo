        "text": "Films About Women Opening This Week\n\nNovitiate — Written and Directed by Margaret Betts (Opens in NY and LA)\n\nSpanning over a decade from the early 1950s through to the mid-60s, “Novitiate” is about a young girl’s first initiation with love, in this case with God. Raised by a non-religious, single mother in rural Tennessee, a scholarship to Catholic school soon finds Cathleen (Margaret Qualley) drawn into the mystery and romanticism of a life devoted to the worship and servitude of God. With the dawn of the Vatican II era, radical changes in the Church are threatening the course of nuns’ lives. As she progresses from the postulant to the novitiate stage of training, Cathleen finds her faith repeatedly confronted and challenged by the harsh, often inhumane realities of being a servant of God.

Here, in the Swiss countryside, little or nothing is felt of the huge social upheavals that the movement of May 1968 has caused. Nora’s life, too, has been unaffected; she is a retiring, quiet person, well liked by everyone — until she begins to campaign publicly and pugnaciously for women’s right to vote, an issue that will be put before the male voters on February 7, 1971. (Press materials)\n\nRead Women and Hollywood’s interview with Petra Volpe.\n\nFind screening info here.\n\nMelissa Silverstein will be moderating a Q&A with Petra Volpe at a “Divine Order” screening on October 28. Click here for more information.\n\nAll I See Is You\n\nGina (Blake Lively) and husband, James (Jason Clarke), have an almost perfect marriage. After being blinded as a child in a nearly fatal car crash that claimed her parents’ lives, Gina depends on James to be her eyes — a dependence that appears to solidify their passionate relationship. Despite her disability, the two enjoy a colorful existence in Bangkok, Thailand where James works in insurance and Gina explores life in a foreign country. But when Gina is given the opportunity to have a corneal transplant and regains her vision, their life and relationship are upended. Gina now sees the world with a new sense of wonder and independence which James finds threatening. It is only when Gina suddenly begins to lose her sight again that she finally realizes the disturbing reality of their marriage and their lives.

Her life is thrown into turmoil when her 14-year-old son falls victim to an accident.

Ronnie’s on an epic bender; Faye has taken up crafting. Though life-long best friends, Ronnie and Faye lost touch when Garrett got sick. But when Ronnie’s drinking hits a dangerous high, Faye returns home to get her back on track. She kidnaps Ronnie and takes off for the family cottage in picturesque rocky mountains. Waking up halfway to nowhere is not the hangover Ronnie was expecting, but Faye is determined to air her out. (Press materials)\n\nMr. Roosevelt — Written and Directed by Noël Wells (Opens in Austin)\n\nEmily (Noël Wells), a talented but hard-to-classify comedic performer, left behind her home and boyfriend to pursue career opportunities in LA. When a loved one falls ill, Emily rushes back to Austin where she’s forced to stay with her ex-boyfriend (Nick Thune) and his new-and-improved girlfriend (Britt Lower), a totally together woman with a five-year plan. Though Emily is the same, everything else is different: her house has been smartly redecorated, her rocker boyfriend is training to be a real estate agent, and her old haunts show serious signs of gentrification. Holed up in her own guest room, Emily — who has no idea what she’ll be doing five days from now, let alone five years — is forced to question everyone’s values: are they sell-outs or have they just figured out what makes them happy? And is she following her dreams or is she just a self-absorbed loser? (Press materials)\n\nRead Women and Hollywood’s interview with Noël Wells.\n\nJoan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold (Documentary) (Available on Netflix)\n\nLiterary icon Joan Didion reflects on her remarkable career and personal struggles in this intimate documentary directed by her nephew, Griffin Dunne (“I Love Dick”). (Press materials)\n\nGrace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami (Documentary) — Directed by Sophie Fiennes (Opens in the UK)\n\nIn Jamaican patois, “bloodlight” is the red light that illuminates when an artist is recording and “bami” means bread, the substance of daily life. “Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami” weaves together the layers of Grace Jones’ public and private lives, as she moves effortlessly between different facets: she is gypsy, artist, and partying hedonist, warm and funny but also a fierce and tenacious businesswoman. This is a Grace we have not seen before, someone who reminds us of what it is to dare to be truly alive. (Press materials)\n\nRead Women and Hollywood’s interview with Sophie Fiennes.\n\nWexford Plaza — Written and Directed by Joyce Wong (Opens in LA)\n\n“Wexford Plaza” is a slice-of-life dark comedy about Betty (Reid Asselstine), a lonely female security guard working at a deteriorating strip mall. Isolated and friendless, a glimmer of hope appears when a make-up salesman shows Betty kindness, leading to an unexpected sexual encounter.

Was that ill-fated car crash really caused by a curse after her alleged romantic dalliance with Anton LaVey, head of the Church of Satan? Packed with fabulous talking heads and dazzling clips from the Marilyn-in-Waiting’s film career, this is a quintessential look at the ’50s tabloid star as a precursor to the feminist advances of the 1960s, as a woman who tested the limits of then-acceptable female behavior, and as “the first reality TV star.” (Press materials)\n\nFind screening info here.\n\nHalloween Pussy Trap Kill!
