But Spider-Man convinces him otherwise and the two unlikely allies go after the true villains; Venom and Carnage. Even after Naoko and Shane are rescued, Spider-Man and the Goblin continue to question each other's motives.\n\nIt is greatly implied that the Goblin is actually Naoko's ex-husband, Hector and Shane's father. Before his disappearance, Hector Jones became increasingly sympathetic to the resistance. He was also a highly skilled inventor, capable of creating the Goblin's gear. It is likely that he is protecting his family by going into exile - keeping them separate from his life as a vigilante and rebel.\n\nHector eventually grows concerned with Peter Parker living with Naoko and Shane, and attacked him. He placed cameras in the basement and later discovered that Peter and Spider-Man were one and the same!. The two are both taken prisoner by a group of beastials called the \"Rejects\" (because the High Evolutionary literally rejected them from society) and pretend to aid them as a means of escape. During the escape, the Goblin is believed killed in an explosion.\n\nIt was later revealed that this wasn't true and the Goblin returned to help Spider-Man, and the rebels battle the High Evolutionary one last time.\n\nBackground[]\n\nGreen Goblin was voiced by Rino Romano.\n\nHector Jones is original to the series and this version of Green Goblin has no particular inspiration from the comics.\n\n[]"
