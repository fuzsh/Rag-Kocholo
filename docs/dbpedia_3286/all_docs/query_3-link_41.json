        "text": "Layering of stomach contents in drowning cases in post-mortem computed tomography compared to forensic autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGotsmy, Walther; Lombardo, Paolo; Jackowski, Christian; Brencicova, Eva; Zech, Wolf-Dieter\n\n2018-04-24\n\nIn forensic autopsy, the analysis of stomach contents is important when investigating drowning cases. Three-layering of stomach contents may be interpreted as a diagnostic hint to drowning due to swallowing of larger amounts of water or other drowning media. The authors experienced frequent discrepancies of numbers of stomach content layering in drowning cases between post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) and autopsy in forensic casework. Therefore, the goal of this study was to compare layering of stomach contents in drowning cases between PMCT and forensic autopsy. Drowning cases (nâ=â55; 40 male, 15 female, mean age 45.3Â years; mean amount of stomach content 223Â ml) that received PMCT prior to forensic autopsy were retrospectively analyzed by a forensic pathologist and a radiologist. Number of layers of stomach content in PMCT were compared to number of layers at forensic autopsy. In 28 of the 55 evaluated drowning cases, a discrepancy between layering of stomach contents at autopsy compared to PMCT was observed: 1 layer at autopsy (nâ=â28): 50% discrepancy to PMCT, 2 layers (nâ=â20): 45% discrepancy, and 3 layers (nâ=â7): 71.4% discrepancy. Sensitivity of correctly determining layering (as observed at forensic autopsy) in PMCT was 52% (positive predictive value 44.8%). Specificity was 46.6% (negative predictive value 53.8%). In a control group (nÂ =â35) of non-drowning cases, three-layering of stomach contents was not observed. Discrepancies of observed numbers of stomach content layers between PMCT and forensic autopsy are a frequent finding possibly due to stomach content sampling technique at autopsy and movement of the corpse prior to PMCT and autopsy. Three-layering in PMCT, if indeed present, may be interpreted as a hint to drowning.\n\nPediatric medicolegal autopsy in France: A forensic histopathological approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelteil, ClÃ©mence; Tuchtan, Lucile; Torrents, Julia; Capuani, Caroline; Piercecchi-Marti, Marie-Dominique\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe aim of postmortem medicolegal examination in pediatric death is primarily to establish the circumstances and causes of death and to exclude child abuse. In France, pediatric death is systematically documented by medicolegal or medical autopsy. In case of medicolegal autopsy, the complementary examinations, requested and financed by justice, are rarely limited to a histopathological examination. However in medical autopsies other tools are available to the pathologist as toxicology, biochemistry and molecular biology. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the efficacy of forensic histopathology in pediatric forensic autopsies. We analyze the main causes of pediatric death in a forensic context. Between 2004 and 2015, 157 infant deaths were identified in Marseille university hospital. The forensic histopathology and autopsy reports of all 157 cases were available for systematic review. Medical or surgical causes represented 41,3% of deaths in our center, accidental causes 8.1% and child abuse 28,8%. The definitive diagnosis was made at autopsy in 30% of cases and at histopathological examination in 70% highlighting that forensic histopathology is an indispensable tool in pediatric medicolegal autopsies. Significant histological abnormalities may be detected in selected organs such as the brain, lungs, heart, liver, adrenal glands and kidneys in spite of macroscopically normal appearances. This justifies systematic sampling of all organs. Despite the implementation of the French sudden infant death protocol which recommends medical autopsies, too many pediatric autopsies are carried out in a medicolegal context. 30% of the cases remain without diagnosis at the end of the autopsy and histological examination. This number could be reduced by the contribution of others laboratory investigation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Few studies have investigated the importance of forensic autopsy in medically disputed cases among different levels of institutional settings. Our study aimed to analyze forensic autopsy in 120 cases of medical disputes among five levels of institutional settings between 2001 and 2012 in Wenzhou, China. The results showed an overall concordance rate of 55%. Of the 39% of clinically missed diagnosis, cardiovascular pathology comprises 55.32%, while respiratory pathology accounts for the remaining 44. 68%. Factors that increase the likelihood of missed diagnoses were private clinics, community settings, and county hospitals. These results support that autopsy remains an important tool in establishing causes of death in medically disputed case, which may directly determine or exclude the fault of medical care and therefore in helping in resolving these cases.

Unfortunately, the existing data is limited and not all fungi were identified to the species level. We, therefore, collected skin samples with macroscopically visible fungal growth from 23 autopsy cases in Germany and identified the fungi to the species level by molecular methods. The identified species included Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, which pose an allergenic risk, especially to persons with underlying lung diseases. Because safety standards are lacking, we recommend the use of respiratory protection during exhumations and forensic autopsies, when fungal growth is noted. With regard to the future, a database was set up which could possibly be used as a forensic tool to determine the time of death.\n\nTuberculosis prevalence in forensic autopsies.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzsoy, Sait; Demirel, Birol; Albay, Ali; Kisa, Ozgul; Dinc, Ahmet H; Safali, Mukerrem\n\n2010-03-01\n\nAccording to the 2008 World Health Organization report, in 2006, 9.2 million new cases were determined, and 1.7 million people have lost their life due to tuberculosis (TB) in all around the world. In our country (Turkey), it is estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 people have TB disease annually. The Ministry of Health could just determine 18,500 of these cases, and only 6500 patient could be treated effectively. According to the Tuberculosis Dispensary records, the incidence for TB in Turkey is 28/100,000. It is aimed to determine the infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis using acidoresistant bacilli microscopy, TB culture, and histopathological methods in tissue samples that were obtained from lungs of forensic cases whose autopsies had been performed in Council of Forensic Medicine Ankara Department Morgue Specialized Committee. A total of 3 tissue samples that were obtained from lungs of randomized 302 cases, were positive for TB in LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen medium. Granuloma with caseating necrosis was found in histopathological examination and acidoresistant (+) bacilli (1+, 2+, and 2+, respectively) in microscopically analysis were also demonstrated in this 3 tissue samples. For this reason, we think that autopsy workers have to be careful about tuberculosis during their autopsy working.\n\nPostmortem CT versus forensic autopsy: frequent discrepancies of tracheobronchial content findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nZech, Wolf-Dieter; Jackowski, Christian; Schwendener, Nicole; Brencicova, Eva; Schuster, Frederick; Lombardo, Paolo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn their daily forensic casework, the authors experienced discrepancies of tracheobronchial content findings between postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) and autopsy to an extent previously unnoticed in the literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate such discrepancies in routine forensic cases. A total of 327 cases that underwent PMCT prior to routine forensic autopsy were retrospectively evaluated for tracheal and bronchial contents according to PMCT and autopsy findings. Hounsfield unit (HU) values of tracheobronchial contents, causes of death, and presence of pulmonary edema were assessed in mismatching and matching cases. Comparing contents in PMCT and autopsy in each of the separately evaluated compartments of the respiratory tract low positive predictive values were assessed (trachea, 38.2%; main bronchi, 40%; peripheral bronchi, 69.1%) indicating high discrepancy rates. The majority of tracheobronchial contents were viscous stomach contents in matching cases and low radiodensity materials (i.e., HUâ<â30) in mismatching cases. The majority of causes of death were cardiac related in the matching cases and skull/brain trauma in the mismatching cases. In mismatching cases, frequency of pulmonary edema was significantly higher than in matching cases. It can be concluded that discrepancies in tracheobronchial contents observed between PMCT and routine forensic autopsy occur in a considerable number of cases. Discrepancies may be explained by the runoff of contents via nose and mouth during external examination and the flow back of tracheal and main bronchial contents into the lungs caused by upright movement of the respiratory tract at autopsy.\n\nCardiac Implantable Electronic Device Interrogation at Forensic Autopsy: An Underestimated Resource?\n\nPubMed\n\nLacour, Philipp; Buschmann, Claas; Storm, Christian; Nee, Jens; Parwani, Abdul Shokor; Huemer, Martin; Attanasio, Philipp; Boldt, Leif-Hendrik; Rauch, Geraldine; Kucher, Andreas; Pieske, Burkert; Haverkamp, Wilhelm; Blaschke, Florian\n\n2018-06-19\n\nPostmortem interrogations of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), recommended at autopsy in suspected cases of sudden cardiac death, are rarely performed, and data on systematic postmortem CIED analysis in the forensic pathology are missing. The aim of the study was to determine whether nonselective postmortem CIED interrogations and data analysis are useful to the forensic pathologist to determine the cause, mechanism, and time of death and to detect potential CIED-related safety issues. From February 2012 to April 2017, all autopsy subjects in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital CharitÃ© who had a CIED underwent device removal and interrogation. Over the study period, 5368 autopsies were performed. One hundred fifty subjects had in total 151 CIEDs, including 109 pacemakers, 35 defibrillators, and 7 implantable loop recorders. In 40 cases (26.7%) time of death and in 51 cases (34.0%) cause of death could not be determined by forensic autopsy. Of these, CIED interrogation facilitated the determination of time of death in 70.0% of the cases and clarified the cause of death in 60.8%. Device concerns were identified in 9 cases (6.0%), including 3 hardware, 4 programming, and 2 algorithm issues. One CIED was submitted to the manufacturer for a detailed technical analysis. Our data demonstrate the necessity of systematic postmortem CIED interrogation in forensic medicine to determine the cause and timing of death more accurately. In addition, CIED analysis is an important tool to detect potential CIED-related safety issues.

A preliminary study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKucuker, Hudaverdi; Ozen, Oguz Aslan; Songur, Ahmet; Bas, Orhan; Demirel, Reha\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPractical anatomy sessions including dissection of cadavers are essential for anatomy courses. There are many difficulties in obtaining cadavers. In addition, hardened and discolored cadavers that are fixed with formaldehyde look unrealistic and generate apathy among students. We considered that forensic autopsies may be used as ancillary and supportive practice in anatomy education. We invited the participation of Year 2 medical students in suitable forensic autopsy cases during the course of one year. Specialists of forensic medicine and anatomy provided theoretical support through talks in their specialized fields during the autopsy. At the end of the semester, feedback questionnaire forms were prepared and the students were asked to evaluate these sessions. Forty students participated in the evaluation by completing the questionnaire. Students made positive statements about adequacy of the time of the application, consistency of the structures with theoretical and practical issues shown in anatomy lectures, and necessary explanations of the lecturers during and after the application. We think that forensic autopsies are an attractive supplementary educational model, and we have decided to continue the forensic autopsy practices. We believe that further studies on the evaluation of the sessions using a larger student population will lead to more conclusive results.\n\n[Forensic analysis of death caused by fat embolism: A study of 20 autopsy cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Lan; Mu, Jiao; Dong, Hong-Mei; Zhang, Ji\n\n2013-12-01\n\nTo analyze the general and forensic pathological characteristics of death due to fat embolism syndrome (FES) and to provide reference data for forensic identification. Twenty autopsy cases due to FES were selected from the forensic center of a medical college from 1999 to 2012. The general and forensic pathological characteristics such as the ways and types of injuries, clinical manifestation and the pathological changes were summarized. Fat embolism mainly occurred after long bone fracture or a large area of soft tissue injury with the majority of cases being fat embolism of lung and occasional cases being combined embolisms of lung and brain as well. The onset of symptoms appeared shortly after the injury or surgery. Lipid droplets could be observed within small pulmonary vessels and verified by special staining. There are particular characteristics in death due to FES in concern with types of injuries, onset of symptoms and pathological findings. In order to find out the direct evidence of FES, special staining (oil red O staining) can be used in the forensic identification.\n\nPostmortem CT Angiography Compared with Autopsy: A Forensic Multicenter Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrabherr, Silke; Heinemann, Axel; Vogel, Hermann; Rutty, Guy; Morgan, Bruno; WoÅºniak, Krzysztof; Dedouit, Fabrice; Fischer, Florian; Lochner, Stefanie; Wittig, Holger; Guglielmi, Giuseppe; Eplinius, Franziska; Michaud, Katarzyna; Palmiere, Cristian; Chevallier, Christine; Mangin, Patrice; Grimm, Jochen M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPurpose To determine if postmortem computed tomography (CT) and postmortem CT angiography help to detect more lesions than autopsy in postmortem examinations, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and to define their indications. Materials and Methods Postmortem CT angiography was performed on 500 human corpses and followed by conventional autopsy. Nine centers were involved. All CT images were read by an experienced team including one forensic pathologist and one radiologist, blinded to the autopsy results. All findings were recorded for each method and categorized by anatomic structure (bone, organ parenchyma, soft tissue, and vascular) and relative importance in the forensic case (essential, useful, and unimportant). Results Among 18 654 findings, autopsies helped to identify 61.3% (11 433 of 18 654), postmortem CT helped to identify 76.0% (14 179 of 18 654), and postmortem CT angiography helped to identify 89.9% (16 780 of 18 654; P < .001). Postmortem CT angiography was superior to autopsy, especially at helping to identify essential skeletal lesions (96.1% [625 of 650] vs 65.4% [425 of 650], respectively; P < .001) and vascular lesions (93.5% [938 of 1003] vs 65.3% [655 of 1003], respectively; P < .001). Among the forensically essential findings, 23.4% (1029 of 4393) were not detected at autopsy, while only 9.7% (428 of 4393) were missed at postmortem CT angiography (P < .001). The best results were obtained when postmortem CT angiography was combined with autopsy. Conclusion Postmortem CT and postmortem CT angiography and autopsy each detect important lesions not detected by the other method. More lesions were identified by combining postmortem CT angiography and autopsy, which may increase the quality of postmortem diagnosis.

Sudden death victims aged 1-45 years examined by forensic physicians operating in the participating regions which also underwent an autopsy between January 2006 and December 2011 were included (n = 70). Cause of death established by the forensic physician based on the external medicolegal examination was compared with autopsy findings using the ICD10-classification. Autopsy findings revealed that the majority of sudden death victims have died from a cardiac disease (n = 51, 73%). Most of the presumed heart disease related cases were confirmed by autopsy (n = 13, 87%). On the contrary, a large number of deaths caused by circulatory diseases were not recognised by the forensic physician (n = 38, 75%). In most of these cases, the forensic physician was forced to report an undetermined cause due to the lack of a solid explanation for death. Cause of death reported by the forensic physician appeared to be in agreement with the autopsy results in 12 cases (17%). Cause of death determination in young sudden death victims is a difficult task for forensic physicians due to the limited tools available during the medicolegal examination. An effort should be made to standardize extensive post-mortem investigation after sudden death in the young. Autopsy can provide valuable information regarding the cause of death, which is of great importance in view of the identification of inheritable diseases among decedents and their families.

Postmortem genetic analysis is recommended in such cases, but is currently performed in only a few academic centers. In order to determine actual current practice, an on-line questionnaire was sent by e-mail to members of various forensic medical associations. The questions addressed routine procedures employed in cases of sudden cardiac death (autopsy ordering, macroscopic and microscopic cardiac examination, conduction tissue examination, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, biochemical markers, sampling and storage of material for genetic analyses, toxicological analyses, and molecular autopsy). Some questions concerned the legal and ethical aspects of genetic analyses in postmortem examinations, as well as any existing multidisciplinary collaborations in SCD cases. There were 97 respondents, mostly from European countries. Genetic testing in cases of sudden cardiac death is rarely practiced in routine forensic investigation. Approximately 60% of respondents reported not having the means to perform genetic postmortem testing and 40% do not collect adequate material to perform these investigations at a later date, despite working at university hospitals. The survey demonstrated that many of the problems involved in the adequate investigation of SCD cases are often financial in origin, due to the fact that activities in forensic medicine are often paid by and dependent on the judicial authorities. Problems also exist concerning the contact with family members and/or the family doctor, as well as the often-nonexistent collaboration with others clinicians with special expertise beneficial in the investigation of SCD cases, such as cardiologists and geneticists. This study highlights the importance in establishing guidelines for molecular autopsies in forensic medicine.\n\nForensic medicine experts' opinion on medico-legal autopsies in hospital deaths: a questionnaire survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nD'Souza, Deepak Herald; Pant, Sadip; Menezes, Ritesh George\n\n2013-10-01\n\nMedico-legal autopsy is conducted routinely in some countries and selectively in others in hospital deaths. This study was conducted to evaluate the views of the forensic medicine experts regarding this matter. A questionnaire pro forma was sent to sixty-five forensic medicine experts practicing in different medical institutions all around India. Designations and experiences of the participants were noted by requests in the same questionnaire. Their specific experience in conducting medico-legal autopsy in hospital deaths was also requested for. Responses were charted in frequency distribution tables and analyzed using SPSS, version 17.0. One-third of the participants felt that a medico-legal autopsy was necessary in all the hospital death cases as defined in the present study. Ten percent of the participants opined that a medico-legal autopsy was unnecessary in hospital deaths. The majority of the experts mentioned finding the cause of death, followed by finding the manner of death and collecting the evidentiary materials, as the reasons for medico-legal autopsy in hospital deaths. Twenty percent of the participants felt that internal findings at autopsy poorly matched with the case records. All the experts agreed that external autopsy findings matched with the hospital case records. Nearly two-third of the participants felt that it was difficult in some cases to interpret the autopsy findings without case records from the hospital where the deceased was treated. Our findings suggest that the exercise of carrying out medico-legal autopsy routinely in every hospital death as evident in the Indian framework is often unnecessary as per the experts' opinion. Autopsy findings in hospital deaths often correlate with hospital case records.\n\nAutopsy practice in forensic pathology - evidence-based or experience-based? a review of autopsies performed on victims of traumatic asphyxia in a mass disaster.\n\nPubMed\n\nColville-Ebeling, Bonnie; Freeman, Michael; Banner, Jytte; Lynnerup, Niels\n\n2014-02-01\n\nCurrent autopsy practice in forensic pathology is to a large extent based on experience and individual customary practices as opposed to evidence and consensus based practices. As a result there is the potential for substantial variation in how knowledge is applied in each case. In the present case series, we describe the variation observed in autopsy reports by five different pathologists of eight victims who died simultaneously from traumatic asphyxia due to compression during a human stampede. We observed that there was no mention of the availability of medical charts in five of the reports, of potentially confounding resuscitation efforts in three reports, of cardinal signs in seven reports and of associated injuries to a various degree in all reports. Further, there was mention of supplemental histological examination in two reports and of pre-autopsy radiograph in six reports. We inferred that reliance on experience and individual customary practices led to disparities between the autopsy reports as well as omissions of important information such as cardinal signs, and conclude that such reliance increases the potential for error in autopsy practice. We suggest that pre-autopsy data-gathering and the use of check lists specific to certain injury causes are likely to result in less deviation from evidence-based practices in forensic pathology. Pre-autopsy data-gathering and check lists will help ensure a higher degree of standardization in autopsy reports thus enhancing the quality and accuracy of the report as a legal document as well as rendering it more useful for data-gathering efforts.

Several of these countries face social challenges and others do not have well established academic programs to teach the science. In this article we intend to review the history and practice of the forensic part of autopsies in a few Arab, Muslim countries (Egypt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Kuwait) and compare it with the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK), 2 countries where the practice of forensic science and Forensic pathology is well established. This was achieved by pub med literature search and the distribution of a questionnaire to colleagues in Arab countries. We recommend that Arab countries explore the field of virtual autopsy to overcome some of the social challenges related to dissection of the cadaver. Kuwait can benefit from the introduction of Forensic training given the high workload in the country. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

The elucidation of the pathogenetic cause of death might be relevant for the prevention of further deaths within affected families. Aim of this study was to determine the portion of underlying genetic heart diseases among unexplained putative SCD cases from a large German forensic department. We included 10 forensic cases of sudden unexplained death (SUD) victims aged 19-40 years, who died by SCD due to forensic autopsy. DNA was analysed by next generation panel sequencing of 174 candidate genes for channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. Cardiological examinations, genetic counselling, and subsequent genetic testing were offered to all affected families. We identified within 1 year 10 cases of SUD among 172 forensic cases. Evidence for a genetic disposition was found in 8 of 10 (80%) cases, with pathogenic mutations in 3 and variants of uncertain significance in 5 of SCD cases. Subsequent selective screening of family members revealed two additional mutation carriers. The study provides strong evidence that molecular genetics improves the post mortem diagnosis of fatal genetic heart diseases among SUD victims. Molecular genetics should be integrated in forensic and pathological routine practice. Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. Â© The Author 2016.

A total of 212 poisoning deaths were investigated by DFM-TMC during the 10-year period. The poisoning deaths ranged from 17 cases in 1999 to 27 cases in 2008. Of the 212 cases, 82 deaths (38.7%) were from pesticides, 36 deaths (17.0%) from carbon monoxide, 34 deaths (16.0%) from drugs, 22 deaths (10.4%) from alcohol, 17 deaths (8.0%) from other chemicals, 15 deaths (7.1%) from poisonous plants and animals, and six deaths (2.8%) from heavy metals. Of the 82 pesticide poisoning deaths, 43 (52.4%) cases were caused by rodenticides, mainly tetramine (N = 39). The majority of poisoning deaths were accidents (63.7%), followed by suicides (25.9%) and homicides (3.8%). The manner of death could not be determined in 14 cases (6.6%).

Based on this routine the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Rostock offers a training course in topographical anatomy to physicians for further training in interventional and surgical disciplines. At the beginning of autopsies the participants can explore the approaches of interventional puncture techniques as well as surgical techniques and the basic topographical anatomy in small groups of 2-4 persons under the supervision of forensic examiners. The format is essentially oriented to the early further training period but fulfils the requirements for the exploration of complex operative techniques. The course was adapted for physicians and offered separately to students. The explorations are performed manually or by support with autopsy instruments. The courses offer an ideal room for individual, discipline-specific topics and result in a great benefit for all participants. A statistical assessment can only be achieved with a larger number of participants. Making autopsy rooms available for teaching and further training represents an additional feature to the profile of clinical forensic medicine. Lessons in topographical anatomy provide a great benefit for patient safety. It seems to be important to offer the opportunity to address individual interests in a closed meeting to consolidate skills and abilities in a non-judgemental environment. The post-mortem examiners have to ensure that the autopsy is carried out lege artis. Basic ethical principles and all regulations from an accredited scope have to be adhered to.\n\nVirtopsy - the concept of a centralized database in forensic medicine for analysis and comparison of radiological and autopsy data.\n\nPubMed\n\nAghayev, Emin; Staub, Lukas; Dirnhofer, Richard; Ambrose, Tony; Jackowski, Christian; Yen, Kathrin; Bolliger, Stephan; Christe, Andreas; Roeder, Christoph; Aebi, Max; Thali, Michael J\n\n2008-04-01\n\nRecent developments in clinical radiology have resulted in additional developments in the field of forensic radiology. After implementation of cross-sectional radiology and optical surface documentation in forensic medicine, difficulties in the validation and analysis of the acquired data was experienced. To address this problem and for the comparison of autopsy and radiological data a centralized database with internet technology for forensic cases was created. The main goals of the database are (1) creation of a digital and standardized documentation tool for forensic-radiological and pathological findings; (2) establishing a basis for validation of forensic cross-sectional radiology as a non-invasive examination method in forensic medicine that means comparing and evaluating the radiological and autopsy data and analyzing the accuracy of such data; and (3) providing a conduit for continuing research and education in forensic medicine. Considering the infrequent availability of CT or MRI for forensic institutions and the heterogeneous nature of case material in forensic medicine an evaluation of benefits and limitations of cross-sectional imaging concerning certain forensic features by a single institution may be of limited value. A centralized database permitting international forensic and cross disciplinary collaborations may provide important support for forensic-radiological casework and research.\n\n[Creating language model of the forensic medicine domain for developing a autopsy recording system by automatic speech recognition].\n\nPubMed\n\nNiijima, H; Ito, N; Ogino, S; Takatori, T; Iwase, H; Kobayashi, M\n\n2000-11-01\n\nFor the purpose of practical use of speech recognition technology for recording of forensic autopsy, a language model of the speech recording system, specialized for the forensic autopsy, was developed. The language model for the forensic autopsy by applying 3-gram model was created, and an acoustic model for Japanese speech recognition by Hidden Markov Model in addition to the above were utilized to customize the speech recognition engine for forensic autopsy. A forensic vocabulary set of over 10,000 words was compiled and some 300,000 sentence patterns were made to create the forensic language model, then properly mixing with a general language model to attain high exactitude. When tried by dictating autopsy findings, this speech recognition system was proved to be about 95% of recognition rate that seems to have reached to the practical usability in view of speech recognition software, though there remains rooms for improving its hardware and application-layer software.\n\nThe importance of post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) in confrontation with conventional forensic autopsy of victims of motorcycle accidents.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoskaÅa, Artur; WoÅºniak, Krzysztof; Kluza, Piotr; Romaszko, Karol; Lopatin, Oleksij\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSince traffic accidents are an important problem in forensic medicine, there is a constant search for new solutions to help with an investigation process in such cases. In recent years there was a rapid development of post-mortem imaging techniques, especially post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT). In our work we concentrated on a potential advantage of PMCT in cases of motorcycle accident fatalities. The results of forensic autopsy were compared with combined results of the autopsy and PMCT to check in which areas use of these two techniques gives statistically important increase in number of findings. The hypothesis was confirmed in case of pneumothorax and fractures of skull, spine, clavicle, scapula, lower leg bones. As for majority of other bone fractures locations and brain injures there were single cases with pathologies visible only in PMCT, but too few to reach expected level of p-value. In case of injuries of solid organs and soft tissues statistical analysis did not confirmed any advantage of unenhanced PMCT use. On the whole it has been shown that PMCT used as an adjunct to forensic autopsy can cause an increase in information about vitally important regions in case of motorcycle accident fatalities.

From Baoji city, 358 cases of forensic autopsy specimens from a series of routine exams were collected. And histopathological diagnoses were reviewed. Majority of the 358 cases were young men. The major causes of death were trauma, sudden death and poisoning. The cause of death was determined with histology in 250 cases. No typical histological changes were noted in 101 cases. The tissue autolysis and decomposition were present in 7 cases. The major pathological diagnosis was cardiovascular disease, followed by diseases in respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems. Forensic autopsy with its professional characteristics, is different from regular autopsy. When diagnosing cause of death by histopathological examination, pathologists should collaborate with legal medicine experts to know the details of the cases, circumstances surrounding the death, and specific forensic pathological characteristics.\n\nThe Characteristics of Incidental Pituitary Microadenomas in 120 Korean Forensic Autopsy Cases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Jang-Hee; Seo, Jung-Seok; Lee, Bong-Woo; Lee, Sang-Young; Jeon, Seok-Hoon\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo investigate the characteristics of incidental pituitary microadenomas, we examined 120 pituitary glands from Korean forensic autopsy cases, from which eight tumors were identified (incidence 6.7%). The average age of the affected subjects was 50 yr (range: 33-96 yr) with a female predominance. The maximum diameters of the tumors ranged from 0.4 to 5.4 mm (mean: 2.8 mm). Immunohistochemical analysis of pituitary hormones revealed three growth hormone-secreting adenomas, one prolactin-producing adenoma, one gonadotropin-producing adenoma, one plurihormonal adenoma, and two null cell adenomas. MIB-1 staining for Ki-67 antigen showed no positive expression. The microvessel density (MVD) of the pituitary microadenomas ranged from 2.3 to 11.6% (mean: 5.3%) and was significantly lower than that of nonneoplastic pituitary glands (11.9-20.1%, mean: 14.8%). Our study provides reference data on incidental pituitary microadenomas in the Korean population.

We used the novel multislice-computed tomography (MSCT) technique in order to evaluate a case of homicide with putrefaction of the corpse before performing a classical forensic autopsy. This non-invasive method showed gaseous distension of the decomposing organs and tissues in detail as well as a complex fracture of the calvarium. MSCT also proved useful in screening for foreign matter in decomposing bodies, and full-body scanning took only a few minutes. In conclusion, we believe postmortem MSCT imaging is an excellent vizualisation tool with great potential for forensic documentation and evaluation of decomposed bodies.\n\nEvaluation of specific neural marker GAP-43 and TH combined with Masson-trichrome staining for forensic autopsy cases with old myocardial infarction.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Tian-Shui; Wang, Xu; Zhang, Hai-Dong; Bai, Ru-Feng; Zhao, Rui; Guan, Da-Wei\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIt has been a puzzling forensic task to determine the cause of death as a result of old myocardial infarction (OMI) in the absence of recognizable acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies indicated that the heterogeneous cardiac nerve sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation at border zones of the infarcted site played important roles in sudden cardiac death (SCD). So, the present study explored the value of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as objective and specific neural biomarkers combined with Masson-trichrome staining for forensic autopsy cases. Myocardium of left ventricle of 58 medicolegal autopsy cases, 12 OMI cases, 12 acute/OMI cases, and 34 control cases, were immunostained with anti-GAP-43 and anti-TH antibodies. Immunoreactivity of GAP-43 and TH identified nerve fibers and vascular wall in OMI cases and acute/OMI cases. Specifically, TH-positive nerve fibers were abundant at border zones of the infarcted site. There were a few GAP-43 and TH expressions in the control cases. With Masson-trichrome staining, collagen fibers were blue and cardiac muscle fibers were pink in marked contrast with the surrounding tissue, which improved the location of nerve fibers. Thus, these findings suggest that immunohistochemical detection of GAP-43 and TH combined with Masson-trichrome staining can provide the evidence for the medicolegal expertise of SCD due to OMI, and further demonstrate a close relationship between sympathetic hyperinnervation and SCD.\n\nLimitations of cadaveric organ donation on judicial cases and problems confronted in autopsy: Istanbul data in comparative perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nArslan, M N; Esen Melez, I; Melez, D O; Cavlak, M; Gur, A\n\n2014-04-01\n\nOrgan transplantation is one of the most important services of modern medicine to the humanity. In judicial death cases the interaction between judicial needs and transplantation needs is inevitable and both should be provided in a short time before the decomposition of the body. Thus, the description of this interaction and the algorithm which should be carried out to manage these cases are important. Aim of this study is to determine the problems confronted in forensic autopsies and to determine what to do for both judicial processes' and cadaveric organ donations' not becoming limited due to each other. With these aims, autopsy case archive of the Council of Forensic Medicine Istanbul Morgue Department was reviewed, between the years 2009 and 2011, to reveal the number of organ donors among autopsy cases and also to find out the judicial problems confronted during autopsies. Among 12,016 judicial death cases referred to Istanbul Morgue Department in 3 years, 35 cases were found to have undergone cadaveric solid organ harvesting procedure and 307 cases cornea-only harvesting procedure. Manner of deaths for organ donor cases were blunt trauma due to traffic accident in 20 cases, firearm injury in 3 cases, stabbing in 2 cases, suspicious criminal battery in 4 cases and fatal falls in 5 cases. Only 1 case was suspected to have died due to high dose insulin administration. Through the whole data presented in this study, it can be concluded that consulting with the Forensic Medicine Expert not only for the autopsies but also during the clinical process of a judicial case, who is a candidate to be an organ donor, is absolutely important. The early contribution of the Forensic Medicine Expert would provide help to plan both the judicial process and the transplantation process which needs urgent decisions. A Forensic Medicine Expert may be an organ harvest team member performing initial investigations on the cause of death and collecting some of the toxicological\n\nUsefulness of post mortem computed tomography versus conventional forensic autopsy of road accident victims (drivers and passengers).\n\nPubMed\n\nMoskaÅa, Artur; WoÅºniak, Krzysztof; Kluza, Piotr; Romaszko, Karol; Lopatin, Oleksiy\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAim of the study: Deaths of in-vehicle victims (drivers and passengers) of road accidents represent a significant group of issues addressed by forensic medicine. Expressing opinions in this regard involves first of all the determination of the cause of death and the forensic pathologist's participation in the process of road accident reconstruction through defining the mechanism of bodily harm. The scope of the opinion as well as its accuracy and degree of detail largely depend on the scope of forensic autopsy. In this context, techniques that broaden the capabilities of standard autopsy are of particular importance. This paper compares the results of post mortem computed tomography (PMCT) of road accident victims (drivers and passengers) against the results of standard examination in order to determine the scope to which PMCT significantly enhances autopsy capabilities. Material and methods: The analysis covers 118 in-vehicle victims (drivers and passengers) examined from 2012 to 2014. In each case, post-mortem examination was preceded by PMCT examination using Somatom Emotion 16 (Siemens AG, Germany). Results: The results are presented in a tabular form. Conclusions: In most road accident victims (drivers and passengers), post mortem computed tomography significantly increases the results' degree of detail, particularly with regard to injuries of bones and gas collections.\n\nUsefulness and limitations of postmortem computed tomography in forensic analysis of gunshot injuries: Three case reports.\n\nPubMed\n\nUsui, Akihito; Kawasumi, Yusuke; Hosokai, Yoshiyuki; Kozakai, Masataka; Saito, Haruo; Funayama, Masato\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGunshot injury has always been an important field of investigation in postmortem forensic radiology. The localization and retrieval of the bullet and of potentially important fragments are vital to these cases. Using postmortem multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) prior to forensic autopsy, we sought to illustrate the importance of this modality in the noninvasive characterization of gunshot wounds. We obtained and analyzed MDCT images in three cases of gunshot wounds (accidental close-range shotgun shooting, suicidal contact gunshot to the head and accidental long-range buckshot shooting). We discuss the value of postmortem MDCT findings in gunshot wound cases by comparing with forensic autopsy findings in Japan, a developing country with miserably low autopsy rate.

We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note. This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011-2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note. An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy. Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the\n\n[Hypothermia as the cause of death in forensic pathology: autopsy study].\n\nPubMed\n\nNikoliÄ, Slobodan; ZivkoviÄ, Magdalena; ZivkoviÄ, Vladimir; JukoviÄ, Fehim\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe body cooling process goes through few clinical phases. These are followed by some morphological thanatological changes such as frost erythema and Wischnewsky's spots, which are used in diagnosis of death due to hypothermia. In such cases there is no any specific autopsy finding. To establish the frequency of hypothermia as the cause of death for a ten-year-period, and to analyze the sample according to gender and age, risk factors and autopsy findings of subjects. A retrospective autopsy study was performed for a ten-year-period (total of 12,765 forensic autopsies). The relevant data were collected from autopsy records, police reports and heteroanamnestic interviews. The sample was analyzed according to gender, age, scene of death, blood alcohol concentration, risk factors, and autopsy findings of all observed subjects. The sample included 67 subjects, 42 males and 25 females (chi2 = 4.31; p < 0.05), of average age 63.9 +/- 14.7 years (min=27, max=92; med=65, mod=55). Nineteen of subjects were found at in-door places. In 13 subjects blood alcohol concentration ranged from 0.50 to 3.32 promille (average 1.81 +/- 0.93). The younger the observed subject was, the higher the blood alcohol concentration (p = -0.251; p = 0.04). One third of the observed subjects were chronic alcohol abusers. Thirteen persons had psychiatric diseases. In 43 observed subjects the concomitant appearance of frost erythema and Wischniewsky's spots were established (chi2 = 49.59; df = 3; p < 0.001). In the analyzed ten-year period hypothermia was not often the cause of death; it was disclosed only in 0.5% of the total number of the studied autopsies. The most of the deceased were older males with cardiovascular problems found in unprotected open-air places. The most frequent thanatological findings in the analyzed subjects were frost erythema and Wischnewsky's spots.\n\n[Grading the level of suspicion in criminal proceedings, restrictions of the proportionality principle and veto options in forensic autopsies].\n\nPubMed\n\nCzerner, Frank\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe article deals with two topics: determination of the necessary level of suspicion for an internal post-mortem examination pursuant to Section 87 (German) Code of Criminal Procedure and options of the family to object to the forensic autopsy. The level of suspicion required in this case is to be regarded as very low, even below that of the initial suspicion, because a detailed opinion as to any third-party fault can only be given after completion of the autopsy. The individual concerned does not have a right to oppose a forensic autopsy while still alive. The same applies to the family. Other than in clinical autopsies, the interest in prosecution is to be considered the higher good to be protected, because at the time of deciding a homicide cannot be ruled out and only an internal examination can furnish the necessary evidence. Consequently, it is appropriate. Contrary to the opinion often expressed in the literature, one cannot infer from the provisions of Sections 87 subs. 4, 33 subs. 3 Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 103 subs. 3 Basic Law that the family of the deceased has a right to be informed or heard. This can only be changed by the legislator in an amendment to the autopsy law.\n\nEvaluation of the on-site immunoassay drug-screening device Triage-TOX in routine forensic autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nTominaga, Mariko; Michiue, Tomomi; Maeda, Hitoshi\n\n2015-11-01\n\nInstrumental identification of drugs with quantification is essential in forensic toxicology, while on-site immunoassay urinalysis drug-screening devices conveniently provide preliminary information when adequately used. However, suitable or sufficient urine specimens are not always available. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a new on-site immunoassay drug-screening device Triage-TOX (Alere Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), which has recently been developed to provide objective data on the one-step automated processor, using 51 urine and 19 pericardial fluid samples from 66 forensic autopsy cases, compared with Triage-Drug of Abuse (DOA) and Monitect-9. For benzodiazepines, the positive predictive value and specificity of Triage-TOX were higher than those of Triage-DOA; however, sensitivity was higher with Monitect-9, despite frequent false-positives. The results for the other drugs with the three devices also included a few false-negatives and false-positives. These observations indicate the applicability of Triage-TOX in preliminary drug screening using urine or alternative materials in routine forensic autopsy, when a possible false-negative is considered, especially for benzodiazepines, providing objective information; however, the combined use of another device such as Monitect-9 can help minimize misinterpretation prior to instrumental analysis.

Data on the characteristics of these cases in Asia are limited. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of child homicides in Taiwan. A retrospective analysis of forensic autopsy records of child homicide victims (aged 0-17 years) in Taiwan, during a 10-year period between 2001 and 2010, was carried out. The age, sex, relationship with the perpetrator(s), injury patterns of the victims, and causes of death were analyzed. In all, 193 child homicide autopsies were identified. There were 38 (19.7%), 82 (42.5%), 25 (13.0%), and 48 (24.9%) homicide victims aged under 1, 1-5, 6-12, and 13-17 years, respectively. One-hundred boys (mean age: 8.4Â±7.0) and 93 girls (mean age: 3.7Â±4.3) were included. A female predominance was noted among the victims aged 0-5. Blunt force (53.4%) was the most frequent method of injury, followed by suffocation/strangulation (20.2%) and sharp force (13.0%). Bruise (64.8%) and brain injury (45.1%) were the most common types of injuries. The cranium (62.2%) and face (60.6%) were the most frequently injured body regions. The distribution of fatal injuries varied among victims in different age groups. Neurogenic shock, asphyxia, and hemorrhagic shocks were most common in victims aged 0-5, 6-12, and 13-17, respectively. The most frequent causes of death included blunt force head injury (40.4%), suffocation/strangulation (20.2%), and sharp force lung trauma (7.3%). The type of offenders, injury methods, types of injuries, distribution of injuries, mechanism of death, and causes of death were significantly different among victims of different age groups. Eighteen (9.33%) victims displayed no external evidence of trauma. The patterns of injuries, mechanism of death, and causes of death were different among victims of different age groups. A female predominance was noted among the victims aged 0-5. Complete forensic autopsy is necessary to identify child homicide.

Deaths among women of reproductive age reported as medico-legal cases were investigated to see the trend in terms of cause and manner of death. The study group consisted of a series of 328 consecutive forensic autopsies on women in the reproductive age group, performed between 2009 and 2011 at the Government Wenlock District Hospital, Mangalore, India by qualified specialist forensic medicine experts. Unnatural deaths formed 93.6% of the cohort. The top three causes of death included burns, poisoning and hanging forming 69.5% of the cases. The manner of death was suicide in 45.4% cases, accident in 43.6% cases and homicide in 4.6% cases. The circumstances of death were related to alleged medical negligence in 2.4% cases. Death in 4% cases was natural mannered with a disease being the cause of death. Three-fourths of the victims were married. Married women formed 63.1% of the suicidal victims. Homicidal deaths were not reported among unmarried women. The preponderant method of suicide was by poisoning at 42.3% (63 cases), followed by hanging (34.9%), burns (11.4%) and drowning (9.4%). These four methods comprised 98% of the total suicidal deaths in this study cohort. Accidental deaths were predominantly caused by burns (62.2%) and road traffic accident (23.1%). Two-thirds of the homicidal deaths were due to assault caused by blunt-force trauma, ligature strangulation and sharp-force trauma. One-third of the homicidal victims died due to burns. With a clear understanding of the cause and manner of death, it may be possible to predict, and hopefully prevent, future cases of unnatural deaths in women of reproductive age who form a very important group of society.

The reason for this decrease in autopsy numbers is multifactorial and may include a general lack of clinical and pathologic interest in the autopsy with a possible decline in autopsy standard, a lack of clinicopathologic correlation after autopsies, and an increased emphasis on surgical biopsy reporting within hospital pathology departments. Although forensic autopsies are currently maintaining their numbers, it is incumbent on forensic pathologists to demonstrate the wealth of important information a carefully performed postmortem examination can reveal. To this end, the Pathology Division of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine has instituted a program of minimum standards in varied types of coroner cases and commenced a system of internal and external audit. The minimum standard for a routine, sudden, presumed natural death is presented and the audit system is discussed.\n\nNew horizons in forensic radiology: the 60-second digital autopsy-full-body examination of a gunshot victim by multislice computed tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nThali, Michael J; Schweitzer, Wolf; Yen, Kathrin; Vock, Peter; Ozdoba, Christoph; Spielvogel, Elke; Dirnhofer, Richard\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe goal of this study was the full-body documentation of a gunshot wound victim with multislice helical computed tomography for subsequent comparison with the findings of the standard forensic autopsy. Complete volume data of the head, neck, and trunk were acquired by use of two acquisitions of less than 1 minute of total scanning time. Subsequent two-dimensional multiplanar reformations and three-dimensional shaded surface display reconstructions helped document the gunshot-created skull fractures and brain injuries, including the wound track, and the intracerebral bone fragments. Computed tomography also demonstrated intracardiac air embolism and pulmonary aspiration of blood resulting from bullet wound-related trauma. The \"digital autopsy,\" even when postprocessing time was added, was more rapid than the classic forensic autopsy and, based on the nondestructive approach, offered certain advantages in comparison with the forensic autopsy.\n\nAnalyses of cardiac blood cells and serum proteins with regard to cause of death in forensic autopsy cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuan, Li; Ishikawa, Takaki; Michiue, Tomomi; Li, Dong-Ri; Zhao, Dong; Yoshida, Chiemi; Chen, Jian-Hua; Komatsu, Ayumi; Azuma, Yoko; Sakoda, Shigeki; Zhu, Bao-Li; Maeda, Hitoshi\n\n2009-04-01\n\nTo investigate hematological and serum protein profiles of cadaveric heart blood with regard to the cause of death, serial forensic autopsy cases (n=308, >18 years of age, within 48 h postmortem) were examined. Red blood cells (Rbc), hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (Plt), white blood cells (Wbc), total protein (TP) and albumin (Alb) were examined in bilateral cardiac blood. Blood cell counts, collected after turning the bodies at autopsy, approximated to the clinical values. Postmortem changes were not significant for these markers. In non-head blunt injury cases, Rbc counts, Hb, TP and Alb levels in bilateral cardiac blood were lower in subacute deaths (survival time, 1-12 h) than in acute deaths (survival time <1 h). Wbc counts of left cardiac blood were significantly higher for non-head injury than for head injury in subacute deaths. In fire fatality cases, Plt count was markedly higher with an automated hematology analyzer than by using a blood smear test, suggesting Rbc fragmentation caused by deep burns, while increases in Wbc count and decreases in Alb levels were seen for subacute deaths. For asphyxiation, Rbc count, Hb, TP and Alb levels in bilateral cardiac blood were higher than other groups, and TP and Alb levels in the right cardiac blood were higher for hanging than for strangulation. These findings suggest that analyses of blood cells and proteins are useful for investigating the cause of death.\n\nFatal Road Traffic Vehicle Collisions With Pedestrian Victims: Forensic Postmortem Computed Tomography and Autopsy Correlation.\n\nPubMed\n\nChatzaraki, Vasiliki; Thali, Michael J; Ampanozi, Garyfalia; Schweitzer, Wolf\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFatal car-to-pedestrian collisions regularly appear in the forensic pathologist's routine, particularly in places of extended urbanization. Postmortem computed tomography has gained an exceptional role to supplement autopsy worldwide, giving information that is supplementary or complimentary to conventional autopsy. In this retrospective study, a total number of 320 findings in a series of 21 pedestrians fatally hit by cars and trucks of both postmortem computed tomography and autopsy were correlated. According to our results, it is best to combine both methods to give well-founded answers to questions pertaining to both collision reconstruction and cause of death.\n\nStudents who wish to specialize in forensic medicine vs. their fellow students: motivations, attitudes and reactions during autopsy practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPapadodima, Stavroula A; Sergentanis, Theodoros N; Iliakis, Roussos G; Sotiropoulos, Konstantinos C; Spiliopoulou, Chara A\n\n2008-11-01\n\nTo investigate the particular features of students who express the desire to follow a forensic career. Three hundred and four 6th-year students attending the compulsory practice in forensic medicine in the academic year 2005-2006 were asked to fill in a self-administered questionnaire at the end of the course. The predominant motivation for following forensics was the scientific interest (39.7%). Gender, marital status, religion, place of residence, number of siblings, father/mother being a health professional, being a religious individual were not associated with forensics. Higher grades were a negative predictor for the forensic specialty. A trend linking rejection of an afterlife and orientation towards forensic medicine was found. The fear of death was more intense in students rejecting forensics. Feelings of fear, aversion and grief during the last day of autopsy seemed to be important negative predictors. Stereotypes about forensic doctors (such as \"forensic doctors have a peculiar character\") significantly modified the decision of students, but the beliefs about the role of the autopsy practice (cause of anxiety for death, stimulus to live every moment in life) did not. Medical students who want to follow forensics present only small differences concerning their inherent features, beliefs, reactions, emotions and attitudes, compared with the rest of their fellow students.\n\n[Forensic Analysis of 20 Dead Cases Related to Heroin Abuse].\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, W Q; Li, L H; Li, Z; Hong, S J\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo perform retrospective analysis on 20 dead cases related to heroin abuse, and to provide references for the forensic assessment of correlative cases.

This study employs text categorization techniques for the classification of open narrative forensic autopsy reports. One of the key steps in text classification is document representation. In document representation, a clinical report is transformed into a format that is suitable for classification. The traditional document representation technique for text categorization is the bag-of-words (BoW) technique. In this study, the traditional BoW technique is ineffective in classifying forensic autopsy reports because it merely extracts frequent but discriminative features from clinical reports. Moreover, this technique fails to capture word inversion, as well as word-level synonymy and polysemy, when classifying autopsy reports. Hence, the BoW technique suffers from low accuracy and low robustness unless it is improved with contextual and application-specific information. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of the BoW technique, this research aims to develop an effective conceptual graph-based document representation (CGDR) technique to classify 1500 forensic autopsy reports from four (4) manners of death (MoD) and sixteen (16) causes of death (CoD). Term-based and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) based conceptual features were extracted and represented through graphs. These features were then used to train a two-level text classifier. The first level classifier was responsible for predicting MoD. In addition, the second level classifier was responsible for predicting CoD using the proposed conceptual graph-based document representation technique. To demonstrate the significance of the proposed technique, its results were compared with those of six (6) state-of-the-art document representation techniques. Lastly, this study compared the effects of one-level classification and two-level classification on the experimental results\n\nTuberculosis in Auckland autopsies, revisited.\n\nPubMed\n\nLum, Dennis; Koelmeyer, Timothy\n\n2005-03-11\n\nTo review the cases of tuberculosis found at autopsy in the Auckland Coronial Autopsy Service in the previous 10 years, and compare the results with that of a similar study for the period 1975 to 1992. Cases which were not diagnosed prior to autopsy are scrutinised as to why the diagnosis may have been missed. A computerised search of the Forensic Pathology Department database at Auckland Hospital for cases of tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection found at autopsy was done. Basic demographic data, past medical history, and police reports were analysed. The cases were placed into five groups for analysis. A total of 30 cases of tuberculosis (including 3 cases of atypical mycobacterial infection) were found. A large proportion (70%) was undiagnosed before death, and each case was potentially infective. Two cases had respiratory symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, and a further 5 cases had generalised symptoms which were unexplained yet tuberculosis was not considered. In those cases that were missed, the autopsy played a vital role by identifying the previously undiagnosed cases of tuberculosis and ensuring contact screening. Awareness of tuberculosis and its increasing prevalence in New Zealand is essential for minimising missed diagnoses.\n\nMolecular pathology of brain matrix metalloproteases, claudin5, and aquaporins in forensic autopsy cases with special regard to methamphetamine intoxication.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Qi; Ishikawa, Takaki; Michiue, Tomomi; Zhu, Bao-Li; Guan, Da-Wei; Maeda, Hitoshi\n\n2014-05-01\n\nMethamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive drug of abuse and toxic to the brain. Recent studies indicated that besides direct damage to dopamine and 5-HT terminals, neurotoxicity of METH may also result from its ability to modify the structure of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present study investigated the postmortem brain mRNA and immunohistochemical expressions of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), claudin5 (CLDN5), and aquaporins (AQPs) in forensic autopsy cases of carbon monoxide (nâ=â14), METH (nâ=â21), and phenobarbital (nâ=â17) intoxication, compared with mechanical asphyxia (nâ=â15), brain injury (nâ=â11), non-brain injury (nâ=â21), and sharp instrument injury (nâ=â15) cases. Relative mRNA quantification using Taqman real-time PCR assay demonstrated higher expression of AQP4 and MMP9, lower expression of CLDN5 in METH intoxication cases and lower expression of MMP2 in phenobarbital intoxication cases. Immunostaining results showed substantial interindividual variations in each group, showing no evident differences in distribution or intensity among all the causes of death. These findings suggest that METH may increase BBB permeability by altering CLDN5 and MMP9, and the self-protective system maybe activated to eliminate accumulating water from the extracellular space of the brain by up-regulating AQP4. Systematic analysis of gene expressions using real-time PCR may be a useful procedure in forensic death investigation.\n\n[Medico-legal autopsy--selected legal issues: the autopsy protocol].\n\nPubMed\n\nGaszczyk-Ozarowski, Zbigniew; Chowaniec, CzesÅaw\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe majority of experts in the field of forensic medicine maintain that the minutes of the medicolegal autopsy should be taken by the forensic pathologist. The authors argue that it is the public prosecutor who is obliged to draw up the minutes, whereas the forensic pathologist issues the expert opinion. To support their stance, the authors make frequent references to several provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1997. The authors also imply that due to organizational reasons and the ratio legis of the aforementioned code, the forensic pathologist should not be assigned the role of the minutes-taker, despite the lack of a specific exclusion rule governing such a case. Possible consequences caused by the lack of the properly drawn up minutes are briefly discussed as well.\n\nVirtopsy: Touch-free autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBadam, Raj Kumar; Sownetha, Triekan; Babu, D B Gandhi; Waghray, Shefali; Reddy, Lavanya; Garlapati, Komali; Chavva, Sunanda\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe word \"autopsy\" denotes \"to see with own eyes.\" Autopsy (postmortem) is a process that includes a thorough examination of a corpse noting everything related to anatomization, surface wounds, histological and culture studies. Virtopsy is a term extracted from two words \"virtual\" and \"autopsy.\" It employs imaging methods that are routinely used in clinical medicine such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the field of autopsy, to find the reason for death. Virtopsy is a multi-disciplinary technology that combines forensic medicine and pathology, roentgenology, computer graphics, biomechanics, and physics. It is rapidly gaining importance in the field of forensics. This approach has been recently used by forensic odontologists, but yet to make its own mark in the field. This article mainly deals with \"virtopsy\" where in various articles were web searched, relevant data was selected, extracted, and summarized here.\n\nAssociation between cytochrome P450 2D6 polymorphisms and body fluid methamphetamine concentrations in Japanese forensic autopsy cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsusue, Aya; Ikeda, Tomoya; Tani, Naoto; Waters, Brian; Hara, Kenji; Kashiwagi, Masayuki; Takayama, Mio; Ikematsu, Natsuki; Kubo, Shin-Ichi; Ishikawa, Takaki\n\n2018-05-18\n\nMethamphetamine (MA) is an illicit stimulant that affects the central nervous system. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) plays an important role in MA metabolism. Numerous allelic variants confer substantial variation in CYP2D6 activity among individuals. In the present study, we examined the frequencies of CYP2D6 alleles, including CYP2D6*1, *2, *4, *5, *10, *14A, *14B, *18, and *36, and multiplication, in 82 forensic autopsy cases of MA abusers and 567 autopsy cases in which MA was not detected (controls). Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM), extensive metabolizer (EM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes were predicted from CYP2D6 genotypes. Of MA abusers, 64 subjects were predicted to be EM, 17 were IM, and 1 was UM. No MA abuser had the predicted PM phenotype. No significant differences in CYP2D6 phenotype frequencies were found between MA abusers and controls. MA and amphetamine (AMP) concentrations were measured in the right heart blood, left heart blood, peripheral external iliac blood, urine, pericardial fluid, and bone marrow of MA abusers. MA concentrations in urine and bone marrow were significantly higher in IM than in EM. AMP concentration was not associated with CYP2D6 phenotype in any body fluid. These results suggest that the MA concentration in body fluids is influenced by CYP2D6 phenotypes in the Japanese population. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we report maternal and pregnancy-related deaths in a large autopsy population focusing on medical history, autopsy findings and histological examinations. Medico-legal autopsy files (n = 11,270) from the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, University Medical Centre CharitÃ©, University of Berlin, and the State Institute of Legal and Social Medicine, Berlin, from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed. All female cases between 15 and 49 years were checked for maternal and pregnancy-related death, and deaths of pregnant women from non-natural causes were also included. Fatalities that met the chosen criteria were classified as \"direct gestational death,\" \"indirect gestational death\" or \"non-gestational death.\" 13 female fatalities (0.12 %) met the chosen criteria (median age 28 years Â± 6.87 SD). Eight (61.5 %) women died in-hospital, four (30.8 %) at home, and one woman died in public. Three cases (23.1 %) were \"non-gestational deaths,\" and one case (7.7 %) remained unclear after autopsy and additional examinations. Of the remaining nine cases, six cases (46.5 %) were \"direct gestational deaths,\" and two cases (15.4 %) were \"indirect gestational deaths.\" One case (7.7 %) was not to be defined as \"late maternal death,\" but the cause of death seemed to be directly related to previous gestation [\"(very) late maternal death\"]. Maternal deaths during pregnancy, both from pregnancy-related or other causes, remain an uncommon event in routine forensic autopsy practice. We report on the collection and analysis of maternal and pregnancy-related deaths in a large autopsy population, with particular attention to the phenomenology of pregnancy, pathophysiological changes in different organ systems and their detection, and the forensic autopsy assessment.\n\nPostmortem bone marrow analysis in forensic science: study of 73 cases and review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nTattoli, Lucia; Tsokos, Michael; Sautter, Julia; Anagnostopoulos, Joannis; Maselli, Eloisa; Ingravallo, Giuseppe; Delia, Mario; Solarino, Biagio\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn forensic sciences, bone marrow (BM) is an alternative matrix in postmortem toxicology because of its good resistance to autolysis and contaminations. Nevertheless, few studies have been focused on postmortem BM morphological changes after pathological stimuli. We examined 73 BM samples from forensic autopsies; causes of death were both natural and traumatic. BM samples were collected from the sternum by needle aspiration and biopsy; in selected cases, immunohistochemistry was performed. Few autolytic changes were found; BM cellularity decreased with increasing age and postmortem interval. Notable cell changes were detected in 45 cases (61.64%): neoplastic (n=4), and non-neoplastic BM findings (n=41), including multiorgan failure/sepsis (n=26), myelodisplastic-like conditions (n=11), and anaphylactic reactions (n=4). The results showed that BM cellularity supported circumstantial and autopsy findings, suggesting that BM samples could be a useful tool in forensic science applications.

Six-teen subjects presented with RBH and underwent PMCT, external inspection and conventional autopsy. External inspection was evaluated for findings of the bulbs, black eye, raccoon eyes and Battle's sign. Fractures of the viscerocranium, orbital lesions and RBH were evaluated by PMCT. Autopsy and PMCT was evaluated for orbital roof and basilar skull fracture. The leading manner of death was accident with central regulatory failure in cases of RBH (31.25%). Imaging showed a high sensitivity in detection of orbital roof and basilar skull fractures (100%), but was less specific compared to autopsy. Volume of RBH (0.1-2.4ml) correlated positively to the presence of Battle's sign (p<0.06) and the postmortem interval. Ecchymosis on external inspection correlated with RBH. There was a statistical significant correlation between bulbar lesion and RBH. Orbital roof fracture count weakly correlated with the total PMCT derived RBH volume. Maxillary hemosinus correlated to maxillary fractures, but not to RBH. RBH are a specific finding in forensically relevant head trauma. PMCT is an excellent tool in detecting and quantifying morphological trauma findings particularly in the viscerocranium, one of the most relevant \"blind spots\" of classic autopsy. PMCT was superior in detecting osseous lesions, scrutinizing autopsy as the gold standard. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In fact, the law schedules the destruction of such samples at the end of the judicial investigation, and the common law rules governing cadaver research cannot be applied to the forensic context. However, nothing seems in itself to stand in the way of such research since, despite their specific nature, these samples from forensic autopsies could be subject, following legislative amendments, to common law relating to medical research on samples taken from deceased persons. But an essential legislative amendment, firstly to allow the Biomedicine Agency to become authorized to issue a research permit and secondly, to change the research conditions in terms of the non-opposition of the deceased to said research. Such an amendment would be a true breakthrough because it would allow teams to continue to move forward calmly in research, and allow this research to be placed within a legal framework, which would promote international exchanges.

A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Teaching Hospital-Kurunegala during 2011 to 2013. Based on the pattern of the presence of gray hair in different body sites, six stages of gray hair were computed. The analysis 1155 autopsy cases revealed strong, positive correlations between age and appearance of gray hair in head, mustache, beard, and pubic area among males and strong, positive correlations between age and the appearance of gray hair in head and pubic area among females (p < 0.01). Our findings demonstrate the value of information of appearance of gray hair for age estimation in the field of forensic science.

At autopsy, it is evident that the most common cause of pedestrian death is central nervous system injury, followed by skull base fractures, internal bleeding, lower limb haemorrhage, skull vault fractures, cervical spinal cord injury and airway compromise. The attribution of accident responsibility can be realised through reconstruction of road accident dynamics, investigation of the scene, survey of the vehicle involved and examination of the victim(s). A case study concerning a car accident where both humans and pets were involved is reported here. Investigation and reconstruction of the crime scene were conducted by a team consisting of forensic pathologists and forensic veterinarians. At the scene investigation, the pedestrian and his dog were recovered on the side of the road. An autopsy and a necropsy were conducted on the man and the dog, respectively. In addition, a complete inspection of the sports utility vehicle (SUV) implicated in the road accident was conducted. The results of the autopsy and necropsy were compared and the information was used to reconstruct the collision. This unusual case was solved through the collaboration between forensic pathology and veterinary forensic medicine, emphasising the importance of this kind of co-operation to solve a crime scene concerning both humans and animals.

In six of the cases, deaths occurred after drinking homemade medicated liquor containing aconite, and in one case death was due to ingestion of traditional Chinese medication containing aconite. Forensic autopsy and pathological examinations ruled out the presence of physical trauma or life-threatening diseases. Diagnosis of aconite poisoning was made after postmortem toxicological analysis. Animal experiment was performed in one case demonstrating that the medicated liquor could cause death rapidly. We present the autopsy and histopathological findings, toxicological analysis, and results of animal experiment done on samples from those seven cases. As an important herbal Chinese medicine, Aconitum species deserve special attention, especially because it contains poisonous alkaloids. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The main causes of death among the athletes as a result of using doping substances are considered. Much attention is given to adverse reactions induced by long-time intake of anabolic steroids many of which can be identified at autopsy.\n\nVIRTOPSY - the Swiss virtual autopsy approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nThali, Michael J; Jackowski, Christian; Oesterhelweg, Lars; Ross, Steffen G; Dirnhofer, Richard\n\n2007-03-01\n\nThe aim of the VIRTOPSY project () is utilizing radiological scanning to push low-tech documentation and autopsy procedures in a world of high-tech medicine in order to improve scientific value, to increase significance and quality in the forensic field. The term VIRTOPSY was created from the terms virtual and autopsy: Virtual is derived from the Latin word 'virtus', which means 'useful, efficient and good'. Autopsy is a combination of the old Greek terms 'autos' (=self) and 'opsomei' (=I will see). Thus autopsy means 'to see with ones own eyes'. Because our goal was to eliminate the subjectivity of \"autos\", we merged the two terms virtual and autopsy - deleting \"autos\" - to create VIRTOPSY. Today the project VIRTOPSY combining the research topics under one scientific umbrella, is characterized by a trans-disciplinary research approach that combines Forensic Medicine, Pathology, Radiology, Image Processing, Physics, and Biomechanics to an international scientific network. The paper will give an overview of the Virtopsy change process in forensic medicine.\n\nComparison of hard tissues that are useful for DNA analysis in forensic autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneko, Yu; Ohira, Hiroshi; Tsuda, Yukio; Yamada, Yoshihiro\n\n2015-11-01\n\nForensic analysis of DNA from hard tissues can be important when investigating a variety of cases resulting from mass disaster or criminal cases. This study was conducted to evaluate the most suitable tissues, method and sample size for processing of hard tissues prior to DNA isolation. We also evaluated the elapsed time after death in relation to the quantity of DNA extracted. Samples of hard tissues (37 teeth, 42 skull, 42 rib, and 39 nails) from 42 individuals aged between 50 and 83 years were used. The samples were taken from remains following forensic autopsy (from 2 days to 2 years after death). To evaluate the integrity of the nuclear DNA isolated, the percentage of allele calls for short tandem repeat profiles were compared between the hard tissues. DNA typing results indicated that until 1 month after death, any of the four hard tissue samples could be used as an alternative to teeth, allowing analysis of all of the loci. However, in terms of the sampling site, collection method and sample size adjustment, the rib appeared to be the best choice in view of the ease of specimen preparation. Our data suggest that the rib could be an alternative hard tissue sample for DNA analysis of human remains. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A questionnaire was posted to all 76 departments of forensic medicine performing medico-legal autopsies in Japan, and responses were received from 48 (63.2%). Of the respondents, 12.8% had approached and communicated with bereaved families about collecting samples from the deceased person during an autopsy and the storage of the samples. In addition, 23.4% of these had informed families that samples might be used in research. Eighteen departments had received enquiries and requests from families about the samples, with most requests concerning their return. The response to such requests varied according to the department. Few departments interacted with the bereaved families regarding the procedure for obtaining autopsy samples, and their methods for handling family concerns differed depending on the person within the department authorised to contact the family. Moreover, the procedures for engaging in such communication have long been unclear, and no legal or ethical consensus or agreement with the general public has been established. It is important for researchers to further discuss the correct way for forensic medicine departments to communicate with bereaved families. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Murder victims form a central part of forensic medical examiners' case load, and women murdered by intimate partners are an important subgroup, representing the most severe form and consequence of intimate partner violence. Our aim was to describe the epidemiology of female murder in South Africa (by intimate and non-intimate partners); and to describe and compare autopsy findings, forensic medical management of cases and the contribution of these to legal outcomes. Methods We did a retrospective national study in a proportionate random sample of 25 medico-legal laboratories to identify all homicides in 1999 of women aged 14 years and over. Data were abstracted from the mortuary file and autopsy report, and collected from a police interview. Findings In 21.5% of cases the perpetrator was convicted. Factors associated with a conviction for the female murders included having a history of intimate partner violence 1.18 (95%CI: 0.16â2.20), weapon recovered 1.36 (95% CI:0.58â2.15) and a detective visiting the crime scene 1.57 (95% CI:0.14â3.00).

The authors present a two-fatality rotary wing crash scenario illustrating application of advanced radiographic techniques that can guide and supplement the forensic pathologist's physical autopsy. The radiographic findings also have the potential for use by the aircraft mishap investigation board. Prior to forensic autopsy, the two crash fatalities were imaged with conventional two-dimensional radiographs (digital technique) and with multidetector CT The CT data were used for multiplanar two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction. The forensic pathologist was provided with information about skeletal fractures, metal fragment location, and other pathologic findings of potential use in the physical autopsy. The radiologic autopsy served as a supplement to the physical autopsy and did not replace the traditional autopsy in these cases. Both individuals sustained severe blunt force trauma with multiple fractures of the skull, face, chest, pelvis, and extremities. Individual fractures differed; however, one individual showed hand and lower extremity injuries similar to those associated with control of the aircraft at the time of impact. The concept of \"control injury\" has been challenged by Campman et al., who found that control surface injuries have a low sensitivity and specificity for establishing who the pilot was in an accident. The application of new post mortem imaging techniques may help to resolve control injury questions. In addition, the combination of injuries in our cases may contribute to further understanding of control surface injury patterns in helicopter mishaps.\n\n[Forensic analysis of 7 infant homicide cases in Suzhou].\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Ming; Zhu, Jin-Long; Zhang, Lu; Wu, Rong-Qi; Chen, Xin\n\n2014-02-01\n\nTo discuss and summarize the major characteristics, autopsy examination, and scene investigation in infant homicide cases. From 2008 to 2013 in Suzhou, the information of seven detected infant homicide cases were collected and analyzed. The criminal suspects were victims' mothers with young ages and pregnancies were premarital. Infant homicide cases occurred at the same location of the delivery. The infants died of mechanical asphyxia in the majority of the cases. Most bodies were naked and their umbilical cords were not cut by iatrogenic method and didn't connect with the bodies. The standardization of forensic investigation can improve the analysis and detection of infant homicide cases.\n\nThe role of forensic botany in crime scene investigation: case report and review of literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nAquila, Isabella; Ausania, Francesco; Di Nunzio, Ciro; Serra, Arianna; Boca, Silvia; Capelli, Arnaldo; Magni, Paola; Ricci, Pietrantonio\n\n2014-05-01\n\nManagement of a crime is the process of ensuring accurate and effective collection and preservation of physical evidence. Forensic botany can provide significant supporting evidences during criminal investigations. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the importance of forensic botany in the crime scene. We reported a case of a woman affected by dementia who had disappeared from nursing care and was found dead near the banks of a river that flowed under a railroad. Two possible ways of access to crime scene were identified and denominated \"Path A\" and \"Path B.\" Both types of soil and plants were identified. Botanical survey was performed. Some samples of Xanthium Orientalis subsp. Italicum were identified. The fall of woman resulted in external injuries and vertebral fracture at autopsy. The botanical evidence is important when crime scene and autopsy findings are not sufficient to define the dynamics and the modality of death.
