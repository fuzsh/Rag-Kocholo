Read on, dear reader. Help me to find love for this story, for I am in a pit of despair after reading this mediocre tripe. (Too harsh? Sorry)\n\nCredit Where Credit Is Due\n\nStory Title: Dark Web: Yes, It’s Still Happening\n\nWriter: Zeb Wells\n\nPenciler: Ed McGuinness\n\nInker: Cliff Rathburn\n\nColorist: Marco Menyz\n\nLetterer: VC’s Joe Caramanga\n\nCover Artists: John Romita, Jr, Scott Hanna, and Marco Menyz\n\nAsst. Editor: Kaeden McGahey\n\nEditor: Nick Lowe (Albert Banaszak)\n\nPublished: The 11th day of the first month of the year of our Lord – 2023.\n\nRemedial ASM 101\n\nWell Ben is bad. Again. This time he teamed up with another bad clone. Together, they have unleashed demons on New York and pulled Peter and a few friends into Limbo. Ben’s grand plan: to get Peter to eat some sort of rotten fruit that will allow Ben to gain Peter’s memories. Or soul. Or essence. Something like that.\n\nThe Story – Pay Attention, This Will Be on the Test\n\nPeter is in Limbo and will remain there until he eats the nasty memory/soul fruit. There are lots of demons in Limbo, but these are the discount kind of demons and not Ghost Rider-type demons. They are pretending to be humans as Ben as redesigned Limbo to look like New York. Jonah and Robbie are there too, and they have to pretend to run the Daily Bugle with demons as their reporters. The Goblin Queen is starting to regret this pairing with Chasm, allows him to continue to use her demons to create a twisted form of the Sinister Six that he calls the Insidious Six. One of the demons, a short little runt picked on by the other demons, wants to be Spider-Man, so he gets a bit of symbiote and gains the proportionate speed, strength, and agility of a demon spider, and goes off to save our hero Spider-Man.\n\nWhat Passed and Failed\n\nPASS – The art is good. Let’s keep this Ed McGuinness guy.\n\nFAIL – This entire story arc\n\nOOTI (Onomatopoeia of the Issue)\n\nOn a scale of 1 (POW) to 10 (BLRKBQRKPQRBLNB), CHRNCH gets a 7. Intriguing sound and nice play on ‘crunch’. Say it aloud right now wherever you are. It has a nice vowel-less quality. This is perhaps the best part of the comic. You could probably stop reading the review and end on this nice note.\n\nAnalysis\n\nI can sum up my feelings for this entire issue in this one panel:\n\nThis issue is one of the biggest literature waste of time let down – and that’s saying something because I have read both “Mrs. Brill” and The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. For both of those works, the title was the most interesting part of it. Heck, I would rather read Scarlet Letter again in its entirety before reading this again. Well, maybe that’s a bit too extreme.\n\nBen’s plan – OK, so I get that the set up is if Ben can convince Peter to eat the fruit, then he (at least he believes this to be true) will get all the memories he lost. He will regain his identity as a clone of Peter Parker. I also get that by putting JJJ and Robbie in danger, he may force Peter to give in. That, at least, makes some sense. It’s not a good story, but it makes some sense. The attack on New York, I assume, is for the X-Men part of this story. You’ll have to ask Ryan or watch the satellite show for more on that. Turning Limbo into a twisted New York makes not a whit of sense. But to have Peter Parker just relive a twisted version of his high school life until he gets tired of it? How does this promote Ben’s agenda? The demons themselves all seem to be buffoons who don’t seem to have anything else better to do. They are very much akin to the Beyond Corp villains and sentient sandwiches. Maddie is also seriously reconsidering aligning herself with Ben. I don’t blame her.\n\nThe forbidden fruit – I do like that the fruit looks like an apple because of the whole apple of Eden vibe it has going for it (though the bible never calls it an apple and some scholars with way too much time on their hands speculate that it was a pear, but let’s be honest, who in their right mind is going to risk God’s wrath for a pear of all fruits?).\n\nThe Insidious Six – I love bad villains. You know this. However, this version of the Insidious Six holds no appeal to me. Why? Shouldn’t this be right up my alley? The problem is there is nothing for me to be invested in. They aren’t losers that I can root for, root against, hope they find some success, or anything. They are just meant to be jokes without substance. Again, this is much like that final showdown in the Beyond arc with the crazy villains that had no story to them. I don’t see how facing these guys would make Peter reconsider damning his soul voluntarily. The demons going after Mary Jane and Black Cat are much more frightening than these guys.\n\nOK, I have to admit, I do like Spidey’s response to them.\n\nParker-Man/Rek-Rap – The little demon whose life (un-life) parallels that of Peter and wants to be the hero is probably the most interesting bit, but that is a low bar to clear. So when he is a little nerd villain being picked on, Peter saves him. This little act of kindness is enough to make Peter his idol. When the demons were getting powers to be mock villains, he wanted powers to be a hero. The demons kept telling him that he had it backwards, thus the name ‘Parker’ backwards and the back spider logo on his chest. I do like the back spider logo on the front look here.\n\nI really want to like this character, in no small part that his Parker-Man persona reminds me of Neil Bogenrider. Tell me you can’t picture Neil running out in the streets in nothing but a Spider-Man t-shirt and underwear. Neil, I challenge you to deny that you HAVEN’T run around in the street with your Spidey shirt and some tighty-whiteys! In fact, you may not have noticed, but I replaced my usual Chi-Town graduate Spidey with Parker-Man. You probably had a difficult time noticing the differences, but Parker-Man doesn’t wear a graduation cap, while Chi-Town does.\n\nMy problem with the whole Limbo story – Well, I have many, but the main issue is Peter has a complicated history with the Marvel underworld. We need to either address the elephant in the room or leave Spider-Man out of the underworld. I know Limbo is a different place than Mephisto’s realm, but the overall feel is the same. After Spencer all but led us to a confrontation with Peter and his deal with the devil, only to have it all flushed away, any flirtation with demonic activity is going to carry that weight. It may be unfair to put that burden on other writers who had nothing to do with those events, but the reader (or at least this reader) will anyway.\n\nExtra Credit\n\nI will give anyone extra credit who can convince me to like this arc. I hate it. I hate that I hate it. If you are enjoying it, I am happy for you. I just wish you could share your light with me. Show me the way!\n\nFinal Grade\n\nIf you haven’t guessed, I’m not liking this book. It is silly in all the wrong ways for me. It’s not offensive in that it isn’t really impacting anything important. I have no fear for Spider-Man. I’m not even rooting for Spider-Man. The villains do not move nor do they inspire any emotion in me. The art is pretty good. To that end, I’m going with:\n\nBALDERDASH\n\n*EDIT* So, BD has just informed me that I am not allowed to give non-letter grades, so I’m going with:\n\nD\n\nReview Grade\n\nTo be fair, I’m giving my own review of this issue a:\n\nD-\n\nThis is not my best work. I would hate for this review to be the one anyone judges my work on. I cannot find inspiration to like, rant, or even joke about this issue. This feels more like a non-canon series that has no impact on the canon (like that story where Spider-Man had to keep the city together with his webs and people kept falling apart – I forgot the name of it). Maybe we see Rek-Rap in some Spider-Verse story later, but outside of that, I see no real impact on the Spider-Man canon here. I feel that this is largely just me and the chagrin I feel for not being able to present this issue better for you, dear reader, is overwhelming.\n\nBut Wait! There’s More!\n\nWell, my best buddy Chi-Town didn’t get a letter published (that actually might would have made the issue better (yes, the issue is THAT lacking)), but his good friend did, I mean got a letter mentioned! Let’s hear it for our very own Bruce Wechtenhiser whose letter was so inspiring, that it sparked another person to write in and mention it. And that person brought up Deb Whitman too! Double win for Spidey fans everywhere. Nice going, Bruce! I’m always a fan of when a fellow Crawlspacer gets a letter or mention in the letter pages!\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nWell, at least we are over half-way through this! One more issue for me, so there may be light at the end of this tunnel."
