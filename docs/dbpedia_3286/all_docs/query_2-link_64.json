He’s created intelligent animal-beings, a citadel that can launch into space and an entire planet. And he comes from Manchester.\n\nThe High Evolutionary’s origin story had only been told in a series of flashbacks in numerous different comics over the years, including Thor #135, Spider-Woman #1 and Avengers #186. That was until THE EVOLUTIONARY WAR which featured the Evolutionary as the story’s central villain and included a series of back-up features in each issue which, as THE SAGA OF THE HIGH EVOLUTIONARY, would define his origin going forward.\n\nMust Reads: Story arcs marked with a ✔ are must-read stories from this time period, along with any key related stories and often-forgotten tales that are worth a read.\n\nWhen an issue contains multiple stories, the relevant story is denoted with square brackets. For example [2/5] refers to the second story of the five stories in that issue, so you don’t need to read the other four\n\nWant to keep it simple?
