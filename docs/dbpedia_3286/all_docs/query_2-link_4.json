        "text": "Marvel Comics superheroes\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see List of incarnations of Spider-Man.\n\nAlternate versions of Spider-ManPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceAmazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962)Created byStan Lee\n\nSteve DitkoSee alsoSpider-Man in other media\n\nSpider-Man in video games\n\nSpider-Man in television\n\nList of incarnations of Spider-Man\n\n\"Spider-Man\" is the name of multiple comic book superheroes from the Marvel Comics Multiverse. The original and most well known is Peter Parker created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originating from the Earth-616 universe. Within the mainstream Marvel Universe there have been characters that have taken the mantle such as Ben Reilly, Mac Gargan, Otto Octavius, and Kurt Wagner.\n\nOutside of the mainstream universe, there are different incarnations of Spider-Man in alternate universes. Popular examples include characters such as the Ultimate version of Peter Parker and his successor, Miles Morales, an alternate future version named Miguel O'Hara, a daughter of Peter Parker named Mayday Parker in the MC2 universe, a different take on Peter Parker in the Great Depression era, a universe where Peter's supporting character, Gwen Stacy, becomes Spider-Woman instead of Parker, along with talking animal parodies like Spider-Ham. Originally, these characters were depicted as separate from each other, but they have crossed over together in storylines like \"Spider-Verse\", \"Web Warriors\", and Spider-Geddon, in teams such as Spider-Army and Web-Warriors, where the many different versions of Spider-themed characters are the major protagonists of the storyline. Some of these characters appeared in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and its sequel. Some of these characters were temporarily merged in the same universe in the 2015 comic book series Secret Wars as a part of the Spider-Man family.\n\nThere have been different version characters in other media that have crossed over in comics as well.\n\nPrime Earth (Earth-616)\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Parker, the Spider-Man of Earth-616, is the original variation of the character and appears in nearly every single piece of other media surrounding Spider-Man.\n\nOther universes\n\n[edit]\n\nOther related characters exist in alternative versions of the Marvel Universe called the Multiverse. These characters originally appeared in their own continuity but later on crossed over with the mainstream Spider-Man family. In 2015 all the alternate comic book universes were destroyed and only a few characters joined with Earth-616 characters in its own universe including various Spider-Men.\n\nDC crossovers (Earth-7642)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn some intercompany crossovers with DC Comics, Spider-Man has worked alongside Superman twice, once to defeat Doctor Octopus and Lex Luthor and the other to stop Doctor Doom from providing the Parasite with long-term access to the powers of both the Hulk and Wonder Woman. He also worked alongside Batman to defeat Carnage and the Joker, the two later collaborating to defeat the Kingpin and Ra's al Ghul, with Fisk eventually aiding the heroes in the end.\n\nDeadpool: Samurai (Earth-346)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the alternate universe Deadpool Samurai manga series, which takes place on Earth-346,[1] Deadpool receives an offer to join Samurai Squad, the Japanese division of the Avengers. Before leaving for Japan, Deadpool announces his departures to Spider-Man, who agrees grant him a request before he leaves. Deadpool requests to go web-slinging with Spider-Man, and so Spider-Man allows Deadpool to hold onto him as he swings through New York City.[2]\n\nEarth X (Earth-9997)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the series Earth X and its sequels, in which its universe's Earth is designated as Earth-9997, Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man is revealed and he is no longer a superhero. In time, he becomes overweight and resembles his late uncle as he ages. After the death of his wife, his daughter bonds to the Venom symbiote and fights crime, much to his dismay. During the course of the series, he becomes a police officer. Three other related characters appear.\n\nIn the same universe, an African American homeless man was mutated from the Terrigen Mist and his skin mutated into red reptilian skin with black lines. He can use his Energy Web to trap his victims in a trap of illusions. He went by the alias \"Spiders Man\".\n\nA.I.M. Pocket Reality (Earth-13584)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn this Earth, Spider-Man underwent a further mutation that turned his skin blue, caused him to develop a spider-like language, and enabled him to make webs that have an effect on Iron Man's armors and Doctor Strange's magic, while emitting a smell that repels the monsters on the Thing's side. Using these webs, Spider-Man surrounded a section of Hell's Kitchen to act as his territory for him and his gang (consisting of Daredevil, Hawkeye, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist, Colleen Wing, and Misty Knight). The Dark Avengers had to make their way through Spider-Man's territory in order to rescue Moonstone and Skaar from Strangetown, which resulted in them running into Spider-Man's gang.[3] After Spider-Man's gang subdues the Dark Avengers while thinking that they are knockoffs of the originals, Ai Apaec speaks with Spider-Man in their spider-like language, stating that they are good guys. Spider-Man releases them from their webs. The Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown, where they fought the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake that are on Doctor Strange's side. After the two creatures are killed, Spider-Man is killed by Tigra as Doctor Strange stated that his two creatures were sacrificed so that Spider-Man can be brought down.[4]\n\nExiles\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the series Exiles, which involves inter-dimensional travel, several alternative versions appear:\n\nThe Spider is an alternative version of Spider-Man who merged with the Carnage symbiote and became a psychopathic killer. Before being displaced in time, he had been on death row in his home reality.[5] He originates from Earth-15 and was a member of Weapon X.\n\nA Spider-Man who is a member of the Fantastic Five and dies in a battle against the Spider.[6]\n\nA Peter Parker who is part of a mutant superhero team, Force-X, led by Emma Frost. His codename is \"Spider\". His outfit is the standard Force-X uniform, he wears goggles instead of a mask, and his webbing is organic.[7]\n\nA version of Peter Parker (from Earth-218) who is a child abused by his Uncle Ben. While locked in the cellar, he is befriended by a large spider-like creature, the Tallus, who instructs Blink and Nocturne to lead this universe's incarnation of Wolverine to the rundown shack the Parkers call home. A fight ensues and the creature and Wolverine are both slain. As Blink and Nocturne depart this reality, it is shown that the creature bit the young Peter.[8]\n\nMorph fought a Demon Spider-Man on an alternative world. Later, the Demon Spider-Man was viewed briefly by Mojo and Major Domo as it attacked a young couple in a parking complex, but the Demon Spider-Man killed itself.[9]\n\nHeroes Reborn (Earth-21798)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Heroes Reborn event, a change in the timeline results in a continuity in which the Squadron Supreme are Earth's mightiest heroes while the Avengers never came to be. In this continuity, Peter isn't bitten by the radioactive spider due to Flash Thompson pushing him out of the way right before it happens. He achieves valedictorian in high school and later attends Empire University, but drops out after Aunt May dies in the crossfire of one of Hyperion's battles. He is hired by Robbie Robertson to take pictures of heroes and act as a friend to Hyperion (in a similar fashion to Jimmy Olsen's relationship with Superman in DC Comics). When Hyperion fails to eliminate all of General Annihhilus's hive, Peter successfully manages to evacuate the Bugle and destroy the remaining bug, but is bitten and transforms into a spider-like creature.[10]\n\nHouse of M (Earth-58163)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Man: House of M\n\nIn House of M, a Marvel crossover event, the Scarlet Witch alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans. This world is ruled by mutants and their leader, Magneto. In the miniseries Spider-Man: House of M, Peter Parker is believed to be a mutant, and Spider-Man's identity is widely known. He is rich, famous and married to Gwen Stacy, and they have a young son named Ritchie. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are alive and in good health, and J. Jonah Jameson is Peter's often-abused publicist. Unfortunately, his life unravels when Jameson reveals to the world that Spider-Man is not a born mutant. After the world is restored to normal, Peter suffers terribly with the memory of the life he left behind, expressing a desire to kill Magneto, whom he mistakenly believes was behind the events of the House of M, and the Scarlet Witch, whose powers were responsible for the altered reality.[11] This version is later killed by Karn during the \"Spider-Verse\" event, but was resurrected when Morlun was stabbed with the Totem Dagger.[12]\n\nThe Manga (Earth-70091)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Man: The Manga\n\nSpider-Man: The Manga is a Japanese manga illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami which retold the story of Spider-Man in a Japanese setting. It was originally published in Japan from January 1970 to September 1971 in Monthly Shōnen Magazine. The main character is named Yu Komori (小森ユウ, Komori Yū) to maintain the Japanese adaptation.\n\nMarvel Mangaverse (Earth-2301)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Man (Marvel Mangaverse)\n\nMarvel Adventures (Earth-20051)\n\n[edit]\n\nThis version of Spider-Man first appeared in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #53-61 before appearing in the re-titled Spider-Man: Marvel Adventures comic book series. A modern-day high school student, this Spider-Man's origin is similar to his mainstream counterpart, but his supporting cast is significantly different. Although Gwen Stacy exists in this universe, she and Peter are not dating — instead Peter is dating a brand-new character named Sophia \"Chat\" Sanduval, who is a mutant with the ability to talk to animals. Peter's relationship with Gwen's father, Captain George Stacy, also differs from the original version — here, Captain Stacy discovers Peter's secret identity early on, yet rather than hide this information from Peter (as his mainstream counterpart did), he confides in Peter and becomes Spider-Man's unofficial police contact. While this Spider-Man battles supervillains, he is generally more concerned with combating street-level crime and focuses heavily on taking down the Torinos, a powerful New York City Mafia family.[volume & issue needed]\n\nMC2 (Earth-982)\n\n[edit]\n\nAn alternative version of Peter Parker also exists on Earth-982 aka the Marvel Comics 2 (MC2) universe, appearing as a supporting character in Spider-Girl.\n\nThe title follows almost the entire 616 timeline of the character up until the first attempt at a \"relaunch\" by the company, 1999, where it deviates and provides an alternative ending to the Final Chapter storyline. Peter's wayward daughter May is revealed to be alive and well, and is returned to both Parkers by Peter's first clone, the redeemed Kaine. Despite now being a father, Peter continues to fight crime as Spider-Man, and begins to cope with the new responsibilities brought by his baby daughter.[volume & issue needed]\n\nTwo years later, during his final battle against the Green Goblin, rather than survive unscathed, Peter loses a leg to his arch-enemy and Osborn is killed.[volume & issue needed] Peter finally realizes the price he has paid for being Spider-Man, and ends his career to raise a family with Mary Jane and May. Over the years, he overcomes his physical handicap and ultimately joins the NYPD in a scientific capacity. However, after saving him from an insane Normie Osborn, his daughter May \"Mayday\" Parker begins a career as Spider-Girl behind his back, a decision Peter begrudgingly is forced to accept and deal with, made difficult by his love for May.[volume & issue needed]\n\nRegardless of his handicap, Peter returned to the role of Spider-Man several times. Once was to aid his daughter and Darkdevil, the son of Ben Reilly, against Kaine, another to convince the latest Spider-Man (the son of Jessica Drew) to cease risking his life, and in Spider-Girl #100 to save May from the Hobgoblin. Peter and MJ ultimately have a second child, Benjamin \"Benjy\" Parker Jr., who is temporarily rendered deaf after possession by the Carnage symbiote and being blasted with high-frequency sonics. Benjy later develops powers of his own at an infant age.[volume & issue needed] Peter was killed by Daemos, the brother of Morlun, during the \"Spider-Verse\" event while trying to protect Benjy and Mayday.[13] Near the end of Spider-Geddon, the Other appears to resurrect him.[14]\n\nSpider-Girl\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mayday Parker\n\nThe Spider-Girl comic book series, originally published under the MC2 imprint, features May \"Mayday\" Parker, Peter's daughter in an alternative continuity. This timeline diverged from the regular continuity when Peter and Mary Jane's daughter is returned to them by Kaine. In Spider-Girl, Peter has been retired from crime fighting since his final battle with the Green Goblin, which cost him a leg. Peter has settled down to family life and works for the New York City Police Department as a forensic scientist. His teen daughter May follows in his footsteps against his wishes, but Peter eventually helps her train for her calling. Peter appears in costume several times in Spider-Girl, either to restrain and protect May, or to assist her. Peter is among the superheroes kidnapped by Loki in the spin-off series Last Hero Standing.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn the recent Spider-Girl storyline \"Brand New May\", Peter has uncovered a lab, within it is a stasis tank containing an exact physical symbiote duplicate of Mayday Parker, with notes left behind by Norman Osborn suggesting she is the real Mayday, and not a clone. When protecting his nephew Normie from an exploding test tube, Peter is affected by the serum within much like Osborn was...and begins to develop erratic behavior. He ultimately overcomes an attempt by Norman Osborn to control his mind and defeats him with the aid of his daughter, her clone, and the spirit of his Aunt May.\n\nSpider-Man (Gerry Drew)\n\n[edit]\n\nComics character\n\nSpider-ManPublication informationPublisherMarvel ComicsFirst appearanceSpider-Girl #32 (May 2001)Created byTom DeFalco\n\nRon FrenzIn-story informationAlter egoGerald \"Gerry\" DrewAbilitiesSpider-like superhuman strength, speed and agility, wall-crawling, can fire organic webs from wrists\n\nIn the same MC2 continuity as Spider-Girl, Gerald \"Gerry\" Drew, the son of Jessica Drew, inherits spider-powers and poses as Spider-Man. Created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz, he first appeared in Spider-Girl #32 (May 2001), and is a supporting character in Spider-Girl.\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, had retired from superheroics and gotten married. She gives birth to a baby boy, Gerry, who was diagnosed with a strange blood-borne disorder due to radiation exposure in the womb. With doctors and medicines unable to help her son, Jessica recreates the experiment that cured her of her radiation poisoning, the experiment that made her Spider-Woman. The experiment imbues Gerry with spider-powers, but did not cure him. Gerry's illness strains his parents' marriage and leads to their divorce. Feeling responsible for the break-up, Gerry becomes withdrawn. Jessica tries to alleviate his pain by telling him stories from her past, his favorites involving Spider-Man.[volume & issue needed]\n\nDetermined to make his short time on Earth count, Gerry designs his own Spider-Man costume and equipment based from his idol's, and convinces his mother to train him in how to use his powers. Calling himself Spider-Man, he meets Spider-Girl, and the two initially clash.[15] During a fight between several villains, a bullet intended for Spider-Man kills one of the villains when Spider-Girl shoves him out of its way. Upset that he was responsible for a death, Gerry runs into Darkdevil, who trains him to be a more effective crime-fighter. At the request of Peter Parker, the original Spider-Man, Gerry decides to retire from superheroic adventuring, while Reed Richards searches for a cure for his blood disease.[volume & issue needed]\n\nSpider-Monkey (Earth-8101)\n\n[edit]\n\nA spider monkey-themed Spider-Man appearing in Marvel Apes. The character was later killed by Jennix in the \"Spider-Verse\" event.[16]\n\nMarvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects (Earth-50701)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects series, set on Earth-50701, Spider-Man was abducted by an alien scientist named Doctor Niles Van Roekel. The Thing, Wolverine, Elektra, the Human Torch, and Storm are also abducted and injected with a drug in an attempt to corrupt them. Once infected, Spider-Man's costume is brown-and-bronze with a blue spider mark in his chest. Spider-Man and the other heroes are eventually able to fight off the corrupting infection and defeat Van Roekel. In the aftermath of the invasion, Paragon and the Imperfects join to share the Earth with the heroes.[17]\n\nMarvel Zombies Spider-Man (Earth-2149)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marvel Zombies universe features a Spider-Man who has been turned into a flesh-eating zombie after being infected by Colonel America (alternative reality of Zombified Captain America).[18] Although Spider-Man is just as ravenous as the other zombies when hungry, when he has eaten, Spider-Man is racked with guilt at what he has done, especially for having eaten Mary Jane and Aunt May, but unable to change his nature.[19] At the conclusion of the original series, Spider-Man is one of the heroes who become the Galacti, having consumed the original Galactus and subsequently acquiring his cosmic powers.[20]\n\nIn Marvel Zombies 2, he notices that his hunger is starting to fade and, as a result, is the first of the Galacti to turn against his fellow zombies.[21] Eventually with the aid of Forge, Malcom, and the Acolytes, the zombies retaining their hunger are defeated. Spider-Man is one of the zombies that remain and continues work to rebuild New Wakanda and bury the dead.[volume & issue needed]\n\nIn Marvel Zombies Return, Spider-Man is teleported to a new world, where he consumes and infects the Sinister Six (except for the Sandman). As his cosmic abilities did not come with him, and his web-shooters have dried up, the zombified superhero is forced to make do with his own veins and arteries. Following the death of the Spider-Man of this universe (killed by the Sandman in revenge for the deaths of the other members of this universe's Sinister Six)[22] the zombie Spider-Man works on developing a cure for the plague with the aid of the Kitty Pryde of this universe, using nanites and the blood of this world's Wolverine.[23] With the zombie Giant-Man having followed Spider-Man to this new reality, Spider-Man resolves to stop Giant-Man.[24] Spider-Man releases the Sandman, now infused with nanites, who wipes out every zombie hero and villain with the exception of an infected Sentry who was teleported to Earth 2149. Zombie Spider-Man himself became exposed to the nanite-infused Sandman and dies as a result.[volume & issue needed]\n\nMutant X (Earth-1298)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mutant X version of Spider-Man diverges from his mainstream counterpart in Amazing Spider-Man #102, in that he was unable or unwilling to cure himself of having six arms. For unexplained reasons, he reverses his name to the Man-Spider. A third divergence occurs when he and his clone continue to co-exist after the end of the original Clone Saga. The two keep this a secret by taking care to never appear in public at the same time,[25] but the Man-Spider is forced to admit the truth after his clone is killed by Madelyne Pryor.[26] He himself is later killed.[27]\n\nNewspaper strip (Earth-77013)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Peter Parker of the daily Spider-Man newspaper strip continues his career as a struggling photographer constantly facing down the abuse of his less-than-satisfied boss J. Jonah Jameson, whilst battling crime in his disguise as Spider-Man. In addition to opposing classic enemies, much of the strip sees Peter battle new enemies. He has also teamed up with various heroes through the strip's run, such as Daredevil and Wolverine. He is married to Mary Jane in this continuity, and has often been aided by her in his battles with his enemies. This universe was visited by Morlun during the \"Spider-Verse\" event, but due to time distortions constantly resetting things so that the simplest actions take weeks to progress, Morlun finds his efforts to consume this version of Peter fruitless. The Master Weaver of the Inheritors elects to rebel against his masters for once and seals this universe away in a pocket dimension, where it will remain safe from any further attacks.[28]\n\nPowerless (Earth-40081)\n\n[edit]\n\nMarvel published a miniseries called Powerless in 2004, which describes a Marvel Universe without superpowers. In this series, Peter Parker appears as a young man nicknamed Spider-Man on the Internet. This version had also been bitten by a radioactive spider, but instead of gaining spider-powers, his hand became atrophic. In this continuity, Peter is in love with Gwen Stacy; Mary Jane is not featured.[29]\n\nRuins Spider-Man (Earth-9591)\n\n[edit]\n\nWarren Ellis' parody of Kurt Busiek's Marvels, Ruins, was a two-part miniseries set in an alternative universe where the situations that led to the heroes of the Marvel Universe gaining superpowers led to horrific deformities and deaths instead. In this world, when Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, instead of gaining spider-powers, he broke out into an infectious rash that covered his body before his painful death. He had visited the offices of the Daily Bugle beforehand and infected fellow photographer Phil Sheldon, who set off to figure out how his world took a wrong turn, but succumbed to the disease before he could write his book.\n\nSpectacular Spider-Man Adventures (Earth-9411)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures\n\nThe United Kingdom-based Panini Comics publication Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures was loosely based on the continuity of the 1994 animated TV series.[30] In this series, Peter Parker deals with the day-to-day headaches of balancing a social life with his superheroics. He has a close circle of friends such as Liz Allen, Harry Osborn, and Flash Thompson, and he is involved in a relationship with Mary Jane. However, in this continuity, Mary Jane does not possess an existing knowledge of his dual identity, and thus Peter finds juggling his life with her and his crime-fighting career difficult. Despite this, Mary Jane loyally supports Peter, believing it is his dangerous job as a photographer that keeps him away from dates and other activities. A look into the future reveals Peter and MJ ultimately get married in this continuity and have a daughter, May, who is active as Spider-Girl. At some point in this future, Peter loses his leg, which forces him to retire as Spider-Man.[31]\n\nSpider-Bitch (Earth-807128/21923)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Bitch (Ashley Barton)\n\nIn the Old Man Logan universe, the granddaughter of Peter Parker and daughter of Clint Barton and Tonya Parker, the supervillain known as Spider-Bitch was born as simply Ashley (later referred to in overview text, though never in dialogue, as Ashley Barton), lacking spider-powers yet using her intuition and combat training to conquer a portion of the Wastelands as the new Kingpin.\n\nSpider-Boy (Earth-9602)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Amalgam Comics universe, Spider-Man was combined with DC's Superboy to create Spider-Boy. He is featured in Spider-Boy #1 (April 1996) and Spider-Boy Team-Up #1 (June 1997). In this continuity, Spider-Boy is the clone of researcher Peter Parker, created during an explosion in the Project Cadmus Labs. Adopted by Cadmus director General Thunderbolt Ross, he is given the name \"Pete Ross\". Spider-Boy's power is the ability to redirect his own personal gravity, giving him the ability to climb walls, and to increase his strength. He is able to shoot webs using a special \"web gun\" developed by Cadmus. Spider-Boy is an honorary member of the Legion of Galactic Guardians 2099 (an amalgamation of DC's Legion of Super-Heroes and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy plus the Marvel 2099 timeline). In the Spider-Verse miniseries, he is seen in the background during a fight with the Inheritors.\n\nSpider-Ham (Earth-8311)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Ham\n\nSpider-Hulk (Earth-70105)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Bullet Points, Peter Parker is the Hulk and Bruce Banner is Spider-Man. Peter is killed by Galactus.[32]\n\nBruce is later killed by Daemos during the \"Spider-Verse\" event while trying to extract Kaine from Earth-616. [33] He was later resurrected when Silk cut open Morlun with the Totem Dagger. [34]\n\nSpider-Man 1602 (Earth-311)\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Parquagh is a counterpart to Peter in the miniseries Marvel 1602, albeit without spider-powers. In the series he acts as an apprentice to the royal spymaster Sir Nicholas Fury. A running gag involves Peter repeatedly almost getting bitten by unusual spiders, something that finally occurs at the very end. In the sequel miniseries, 1602: New World, he takes the identity of the Spider. Later, Peter's dual identity is revealed, and with the death of his beloved Virginia Dare at the hands of Norman Osborne, he returns to Europe and falls in love with Marion Jane Watson and joins her family of theater performers. During a battle with Baron Octavius, Norman Osborn, and Curtis Connors in Venice, a bystander picks up some of Peter's webbing, which eventually served as the basis for the Super Soldier Serum and created Captain America in World War II in this universe.[35] While in the Globe Theatre, he is attacked and killed by the supervillain Morlun.[36][37]\n\nSpider-Man 1602 appears in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions as an alternative costume for Spider-Man Noir, and in Edge of Time as a costume for Miguel O'Hara.\n\nSpider-Man 2099 (Earth-928)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spider-Man 2099\n\nA geneticist named Miguel O'Hara gained his spider-powers from a gene splicing incident, when the company he was about to quit injected him with a dangerous drug called Rapture. He tried to rid himself of the drug by using the gene splicer he helped to invent but, unbeknownst to him, a jealous co-worker had set it to repeat the previous experiment of a spider. The last time they had tried this experiment, it killed the test subject (the main reason Miguel O'Hara quit), but this time it worked.

The main purpose of the series is to be accessible to new and young readers, as it is free from the decades of history of the original, but it has been embraced by many longtime fans as well.\n\nThe Spider\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the ongoing series Ultimate Comics: Avengers, a second Spider-Man was shown to be one of its members, and is simply referred to as the Spider. His costume bears an orange-and-purple color as opposed to red-and-blue. The Spider once claimed that he was a clone made from the DNA of Spider-Man and Professor X that was sent from the future.[51]\n\nThe Spider was seen as a member of the Avengers that was established by Nick Fury and Gregory Stark. Where he resided was kept under surveillance indicating that he might've been a criminal in his early life. Spider was said to be crazy where he caused a technician to commit suicide, but is shown to be intelligent as he enjoyed reading books. Gregory Stark referred to Spider as an \"It\" due to what his true nature would be.[52]\n\nSpider accompanied the Avengers in a manhunt on Ghost Rider where he was targeting then-Vice President of the United States Robert Blackthorn.[53]\n\nIn the \"Death of Spider-Man\" story arc in Avengers vs. New Ultimates, he is revealed to be of an unidentified North Asian culture and acting under the orders of Gregory Stark who ordered him to lead a superhuman uprising in North Korea. The New Ultimate and the Hulk Drug-empowered Avengers arrived to quell the uprising.[54] During the events of said uprising, the Spider was killed by Hawkeye after the Avengers and the New Ultimates intervened.[55]\n\nMiles Morales\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Peter Parker's apparent death in Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #160, a new character by the name of Miles Morales takes up the mantle of Spider-Man as a 13-year-old superhero.[56]\n\nThe character of Miles Morales has been adapted into other forms of media, including the Spider-Verse films, where he is the main character.\n\nUltimate Universe (Earth-6160)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe protagonist of Ultimate Spider-Man (2024) is a version of the character that exists in the new Ultimate Universe created in the aftermath of Ultimate Invasion. To differentiate this iteration from other versions of Spider-Man, the series follows an older Peter Parker who is married to Mary Jane Watson and has two kids before he becomes Spider-Man as an adult.[57]\n\nIn Ultimate Invasion #1, in the past of Earth-6160, a young 15-year old Peter Parker meets up with Liz Allan while running late for a science exhibition. Just as an irradiated spider is about to bite Peter, the spider is swatted away by mysterious figure, later revealed to be the The Maker, who wanted to ensure that he doesn't become Spider-Man.[58]\n\nBy the time he is an adult, Peter has married Mary Jane Watson and has kids of his own named Richard and May. He and his Uncle Ben work at the Daily Bugle where J. Jonah Jameson is a family friend, with Ben acting as managing editor. During a false flag attack on Stark Tower that was secretly orchestrated by the Maker's Council, Aunt May ends up being one of the casualties. Tony Stark is framed for the destruction. Sometime later, Peter, Ben, and the rest of their family attend a memorial is held by Father Matt Murdock for those who perished on the attack, seeing Harry Osborn. After the event, Peter and Ben return to the Bugle, seeing J. Jonah Jameson resigns due to some editorial restructuring at the hands of Wilson Fisk. Ben also resigns after refusing to take Jonah's former role. After tucking his kids into bed and talking with Mary Jane, she states her support about the change that he needs, gives him a kiss, and turns in for the night. Peter recalls the night before as he receives a package from six months into the future by Iron Lad. While explaining the truth about the attack, he leaves Peter a gift in the form of a picotech stealth suit and a bio-organic catalyst that he will need for his transformation into a superhuman. He reveals the Maker prevented Peter from getting bitten by a radioactive spider in his adolescence, averting his chance at becoming a hero. He states is also repeating this method to others like Peter and hopes to see a Earth that regained its heroes in six months. Back in the present, Pete recalls Ben and Mary Jane's words of support encouraging him as he releases the spider catalyst and tries on the suit for the first time.[59]\n\nDuring his first outing after weeks of practice while in the black stealth suit, Peter is tricked by Shocker twice when he tried to stop him from robbing a bank. May ends up learning that her father is the mysterious vigilante in the news as he returns home, showing support to him as she agrees to keep it a secret from Richard and Mary Jane for a while.[60]\n\nLater, Peter and May manage to design a suit with a red and blue color scheme. He later visits Ben and J. Jonah Jameson at their new building, where their upcoming independent news company was going to be established. Peter sees the board that they set up regarding Wilson Fisk. He also tells them that Robbie Robertson, the Bugle's new editor, has called the armored figure that's been after Fisk by the name of \"Green Goblin\" and that reports on him keep getting suppressed, while the mysterious black-suited figure is used as a distraction. While doing a stakeout, Spider-Man spots Green Goblin fighting Bullseye and assists in subduing him. After the Goblin's glider takes him away to a different place since most of the police force is on Fisk's side, The Goblin reveals to him his true identity as Harry Osborn.[61]\n\nOn April, Peter Parker and Mary Jane meet Harry Osborn and his wife Gwen Stacy at a restaurant. They talk about different subjects like Mary Jane's career and, PR film as well as Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson's efforts to establish an independent news company called \"The Paper\". When alone, Peter states to Harry that he hasn't told Mary Jane that he's a vigilante as that would endanger her if anybody found out. Peter is told by Harry that \"with great power comes great responsibility\" and to use his gifts, as he advises him to tell her and reminds him of their role at fighting the Council.[62]\n\nIn a flashback to when they went out for a drink after their first meeting, Peter was told by Harry about how he found out that the people who gave him the assets of Stark/Stane and Oscorp are the most evil people in history and that they were the ones who framed Tony Stark for the deaths of thousands, as both agree to cooperate against them. [63]\n\nLater at night, him and Green Goblin stake out the Fisk Building. They confront Fisk who was expecting them. Because Fisk's augmentations to his body are enough to withstand the Goblin's bombs, they are forced to do a tactical retreat. On the morning after, when Peter attends breakfast with a black eye which his family notices, May gives away his superhero work as he is questioned by them, as he tells them what happened the night before. They are surprised but overall support him, while asking him to be careful, After stating how proud she is of him and seeing his suit, Mary Jane comes up with the Spider-Man code-name as he takes her out for a webslinging around town.[64]\n\nOn July, Peter Parker is introduced to Otto Octavius by Harry Osborn. They are told by Octavius that their suits are based off of Stark/Stane Industries technology. He states that Spider-Man's picotech suit is harder to figure out as it would take him time to do that. In addition, both Spider-Man's suit and Green Goblin's armor run on the same network and have an A.I. that can help them with anything. While overseen by Octavius, Spider-Man trains with Green Goblin using an A.I. of himself. The training is cancelled when Octavius detects a third carrier wave on the Stark/Stane network. It turns out to be Iron Lad who states that he did mention that he'd be back in six months as he asks if they are heroes yet.[65]\n\nThe Webslinger\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the sword and sorcery alternate Earth called Eurth, the Webslinger is an alternate version of Spider-Man that helps Captain Avalon rescue his son from the Dreadlord.[66]\n\nWhat If?\n\n[edit]\n\nAlternative versions of Spider-Man appear in several issues of What If..?.

During the \"Spider-Verse\" event, this universe's versions of Reed, Ben, Johnny, and Peter are all killed by Karn.\n\nWhat if Spider-Man Had Kept His Six Arms? explores what would have happened if Morbius the Living Vampire had been eaten by sharks and thus never made it to Connors' laboratory with a cure. Ultimately the arm mutation is irreversible, but it proves an advantage and Spider-Man defeats most of his villains easily. Spider-Man even becomes a spokesman for the physically challenged, and inspires all to rise to their true potential. This Spider-Man appears in Spider-Verse and is killed by Daemos.[citation needed]\n\nWhat if someone else besides Spider-Man had been bitten by the radioactive spider? explores what would have happened if either Flash Thompson, Betty Brant or John Jameson were bitten by the radioactive spider. All three prove to be failures as the 'new' Spider-Man. Each story ends with Peter extracting the residual radioactive venom from the dead spider and using it to create a serum to give himself powers, thus becoming Spider-Man anyway.[68] Versions of all three appear in the \"Spider-Verse\" event, where John is the only one that is not killed by the Inheritors.[citation needed]\n\nWhat if Spider-Man had never become a crimefighter? explores a world where Spider-Man stopped the burglar from robbing the TV studio and continued his TV career, becoming a public relations 'specialist' for superheroes until Jameson's angry attack on him when slacking off with his powers nearly results in Daredevil's death, inspiring Spider-Man to become a real hero.[69] This version of Spider-Man is seen in the \"Spider-Verse\" event and apparently survived.\n\nWhat if the alien costume had possessed Spider-Man? sees Spider-Man being killed when he fails to go to Reed Richards for help in time to remove the symbiote, which goes on to drain the Hulk's powers and possess Thor until it is driven away by Black Bolt.[70]\n\nIn another issue named What if Captain America Were Not Revived Until Today?, Spider-Man joins an underground rebellion to fight an America turned fascist, aids the real Captain America in defeating the instigator behind this movement, and leading the chastised nation back to its democratic roots.[71]\n\nWhat if?

Through training alongside Wolverine, he enhances his spider-sense and becomes more confident. He eventually decides to join up with Wolverine permanently and leave behind his old ways. He also develops a change to his web-shooters which enables him to shoot bullets out of them, which he does, killing a man. He is shown in a sleeker black and red suit more fit for his new lifestyle.[76] This Spider-Man appears in the \"Spider-Verse\" event as the \"Assassin Spider-Man\" and is killed by Daemos.[77]\n\nIn What If?

Spider-Man became the Punisher, Peter wears a black costume with a skull on it and converts his web shooters to fire bullets. Despite killing criminals, his life is similar to his 616 counterpart. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacy, Peter kills Norman and succeeds in saving Gwen. Peter decided to abandon the \"Spider-Punisher\" costume and live a normal life, then a wounded Frank Castle, who saw his family die to mobsters, finds the Spider-Punisher suit.[79]\n\nWhat If... Set Had Come to Earth? features a version of Spider-Man who had been turned into one of Set's Serpent Men. He was later killed.[80]\n\nSecret Wars\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of alternate versions of Spider-Man appear in the Battleworld domains as seen in the Secret Wars:\n\nIn the Armor Wars reality, Peter Urich is a nephew of Ben Urich who became Spyder-Man after being infected with the \"spider virus\". He was dating Kiri Oshiro, the daughter of Rumiko Fujikawa.[81] Spyder-Man was killed by Technopolis' baron Iron Man after he discovered vital information about the disease that forced everyone in Technopolis to wear armor.[82]\n\nIn an alternate Civil War reality where the conflict continued after the anti-registration side's attempt to escape the Negative Zone prison triggered a self-destruct sequence that destroyed most of New York, Peter continued serving on Captain America's side in the conflict and was given new upgrades such as wings that bear a resemblance to the Falcon; with Rogers noting that Peter is now his fastest operative.

As a result, Peter Parker became a successful industrialist married to Gwen Stacy, but Norman Osborn has conquered the world, killing Iron Man and most of the Fantastic Four and imprisoning Doctor Doom, with Peter still hiding behind his corporate role even as Gwen discreetly aids the resistance as he believes that taking action as Spider-Man will only make things worse.\n\nThe \"Perfect\" World (Earth-11638)\n\n[edit]\n\nNot to be confused with Ghost-Spider or Hibana gracilis.\n\nThis version of Spider-Man is called the Amazing Spider, who is rich, powerful, and popular in a world where none of his loved ones have died.

The Amazing Spider was caught between the machine and was placed in a comatose state.[84] While in a coma, the Amazing Spider's soul arrived in Hell, where Bruce Banner's Sorcerer Supreme counterpart died fighting the Infernal Hulk, though Bruce's astral form stayed alive and helped return the Amazing Spider to life with the souls of the repentant damned, which gave him a second chance to live. When he awoke, he found himself transformed into a new character called the Ghost Spider. To make amends with Spider-Man, the Ghost Spider transported him, Deadpool, and the Hulk back to Earth-616.[85]\n\nIn the 2018 Marvel's Spider-Man video game, Ghost Spider appears as an alternate costume, but he has been renamed to Spirit Spider, likely to avoid confusion with Earth-65's Gwen Stacy who has taken up the moniker.\n\nMarvel vs. Capcom (Earth-30847)\n\n[edit]\n\nNot much of this version of Spider-Man is different from traditional iterations, except for the fact that the universe is shared by Capcom characters. This universe does not have a concrete lore, but the main plot of Marvel vs. Capcom does feature Spider-Man contributing in the battle against Ultron Sigma, a fusion of Ultron and Sigma from the Mega Man X series.\n\nMarvel 2 in One\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen traveling through the multiverse, the Thing and the Human Torch get stranded in a universe with an apocalyptic Earth.

Spider-Man starts acting more aggressive, even unmasking and threatening Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley) during an altercation. This leads Kingsley to track him down to May's house, where he blows it up and kills May in the process. Enraged, Peter brutally murders Hobgoblin and decides to take justice into his own hands by killing any criminals that come in his way. After Spider-Man seemingly kills the Kingpin, the Sinister Six (consisting of Kraven, Electro, Rhino, Mysterio, Eddie Brock possessing Doctor Octopus' arms and a reluctant J. Jonah Jameson) assemble in the countryside to take him down. Though Spider-Man kills Electro, Rhino, and Mysterio, Kraven and Jameson separate Peter from the symbiote after discovering its weakness to fire.\n\nJameson takes Peter home and to meet up with Mary Jane and Black Cat, where they find out that Kingpin had leaked Spider-Man's secret identity to the press. As Felicia takes Jameson to safety, Peter and Mary Jane discover that the symbiote has possessed Reed and taken over the Baxter Building, where it has used his scientific knowledge to make itself stronger and take control of anyone inside, including the Thing. Knowing the suit still wants him, Peter ventures into the building with Mary Jane and the Human Torch, where they find out that the symbiote used Reed to create other symbiotes to possess the other heroes present near the building. It then orders them to attack Mary Jane, as Peter's love for her is what prevented it from taking over him completely. Spider-Man and the Torch then lure the symbiote back to the Baxter Building, where Peter offers himself to the symbiote willingly.

He first appeared in Spider-Man (2018).\n\nA pre-spider bite Miles is playable at certain points in the game with an emphasis on stealth gameplay. This version was a fan of Spider-Man growing up and grew up with an affinity for science. His father was killed from an attack by Mister Negative. He is eventually bitten by an experimental Oscorp spider, and in a post-credits scene, reveals his powers to Peter, who in turn reveals his identity as Spider-Man.[153][154] Peter offers to train him in becoming Spider-Man.[155] In the original game he was added as a younger character with whom younger audiences could identify when it was decided to use an older Peter Parker for the game. In Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Miles moves from Brooklyn to Harlem and is tasked with protecting the city while Peter is away on a business trip. He is forced to battle his childhood friend, Phin Mason, who has become a masked villain named the Tinkerer and leads a criminal group known as the Underground. Miles returns in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 as one of the playable protagonists alongside Peter Parker.[156][157][158][160] He is voiced in all three games by Nadji Jeter.\n\nSpider-Man (Earth-26496)\n\n[edit]\n\nSpider-Verse films\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse adapts the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline and the Ultimate Spider-Man books starring Miles Morales. Variations of Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Ham, Spider-Noir, SP//dr, Spider-Man 2099, and a divergent version of the Spider-Man from the 1960s animated series (voiced by Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, John Mulaney, Nicolas Cage, Kimiko Glenn, Oscar Isaac, and Jorma Taccone, respectively) are featured.\n\nThe film also features two different versions of Peter Parker. The version in Miles' dimension, Earth-1610B, has been Spider-Man for 10 years, was married to Mary Jane Watson, and also had a secret underground lair in Aunt May's backyard that housed dozens of different Spider-Man costumes and gear. In the movie's first act, he is killed by the Kingpin while trying to stop the villain from using a particle accelerator to access other dimensions. His death inspires the recently bitten Miles Morales into carrying on his mission as the new Spider-Man and stopping the Kingpin from endangering the city. Unlike other versions, this version of Peter has blond hair. He was voiced by Chris Pine.\n\nSpider-Man's exposure to the particle accelerator causes Peter B. Parker, the Spider-Man of Earth-616B, to get sucked into Miles' dimension. This version of Peter is in his late 30s and has been Spider-Man for 22 years. He was also married to Mary Jane Watson, but they divorced after he refused to have children with her. This, coupled with the death of his Aunt May, sent Peter's life into a downward spiral where he gave up being the wall-crawler, resulting in him getting lazier and overweight. He reluctantly agrees to mentor Miles on becoming the new Spider-Man to return to his home dimension, but later tries to prevent Miles from joining the other displaced Spider-Men when the young hero's inexperience begins to hold them back and volunteers to sacrifice himself so the other heroes can get home. Miles later joins them in the final fight against the Kingpin and his minions after he learns how to control his powers and instills new confidence in Peter that he will successfully defend his dimension. Thanks to his experience with Miles and a run-in with an alternate version of his ex, Peter decides to give his relationship with Mary Jane another shot. He was voiced by Jake Johnson.\n\nThe sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, also features a multitude of alternate Spider people, many original creations but also many returning Spider-Man variants, including Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Woman, Spider-Punk, Spider-Man India, Scarlet Spider, Spectacular Spider-Man, and Spider-Byte."
