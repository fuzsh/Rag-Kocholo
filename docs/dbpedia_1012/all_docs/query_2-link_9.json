        "text": "Idaho Public Television (also known as IdahoPTV and Idaho Public TV) is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member network serving the U.S. state of Idaho. Consisting of five television stations, it is operated and funded by the Idaho State Board of Education, an agency of the Idaho state government that holds the licenses to all PBS member stations in the state. The network is headquartered in Boise, with satellite studios at the University of Idaho in Moscow and Idaho State University in Pocatello.\n\nFunding for Idaho Public Television comes from three major sources. 65% of funding comes from private contributions and an annual grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 31% is provided by the State of Idaho. 4% is provided by the Federal Government.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe network's first station, KUID-TV, signed on from the UI campus in September 1965. KBGL-TV signed on in July 1971 from ISU in Pocatello, followed that December by KAID-TV in Boise, licensed to Boise State University. After a decade, KBGL changed its call letters to KISU-TV in 1981. The three stations shared many programs, but were largely operated independently at first. However, in 1981, two KUID-produced documentaries—one about logging practices, another about lead exposure—caused such an outcry that the state legislature yanked nearly all funding for public television. Citing budget restrictions in early 1981, the state legislature cut 90% of the state funding for public television, and the stations relied on federal funding and private donations. A year later, the legislature ordered the merger of the three stations into a single network. The licenses for all three stations were transferred to the state board of education. Two other stations in Coeur d'Alene and Twin Falls were added in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, Idaho PTV began broadcasting its HD channel, KAID HD, using the default PBS HD schedule. Once the digital switchover had occurred in July 2009 and after a two-year acclimation process, the main HD channel became the home of the regular IdahoPTV schedule in August 2011, and the second standard definition channel was converted from the regular IdahoPTV schedule into a \"Plus\" subchannel, featuring an alternate schedule of programming.\n\nStations[]\n\nFull Power Stations[]\n\nCall signs Location CH First Air Date KAID Boise, ID 4 December 31, 1971 KUID Moscow, ID 12 September 6, 1965 KISU Pocatello, ID 10 July 7, 1971 KIPT Twin Falls, ID 13 January 1992 KCDT Coeur d'Alene, ID 26 September 22, 1992\n\nLogo History[]\n\nComing soon\n\nGallery[]\n\nComing soon\n\nTV stations in Idaho Boise market: Idaho Falls/Pocatello market: Spokane market: Twin Falls market: KAID, Boise KISU, Pocatello KUID, Moscow KIPT, Twin Falls KCDT, Coeur d'Alene\n\nTV stations in Eastern Oregon, Southwestern Idaho and the Treasure Valley, including Boise and Ontario KBOI 2 (CBS)\n\nKAID 4 (PBS)\n\nKIVI 6 (ABC)\n\nKTVB 7 (NBC)\n\nKNIN 9 (Fox)\n\nKTRV 12 (Ion)\n\nKKIC-LD 16 (ESTRELLA)\n\nKCLP-CA 18 (The Walk TV)\n\nKZTN-LD 20 (TBN)\n\nKRID-LD 22 (Newsmax)\n\nK31ED-D 31 (3ABN)\n\nKBSE-LD 33 (HSN)\n\nKYUU-LD 35 (CW)\n\nKKJB 39 (TLM)\n\nKBTI-LD 41 (HSN2)\n\nKZAK-LD 49 (Daystar)\n\nKCBB-LD 51 (AZA)\n\nTV stations in the Inland Northwest, including Spokane, Washington and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho KREM 2 (CBS)\n\nKLEW 3 (CBS)\n\nKXLY/KXMN-LD 4 (ABC)\n\nKHQ 6 (NBC)\n\nKSPS 7 (PBS)\n\nKWSU 10 (PBS)\n\nKUID 12 (PBS)\n\nKSKN 22 (CW)\n\nKQUP 24 (Daystar)\n\nKCDT 26 (PBS)\n\nKIDQ-LP 27 (JUCE TV/Youtoo)\n\nKAYU 28 (Fox)\n\nKDYS-LD 32 (Daystar)\n\nKGPX 34 (Ion)\n\nKHBA-LD 39 (Hope)\n\nK29NM-D 43 (HSN2)\n\nKQUP-LD 47 (Daystar)\n\nTV stations in the Magic Valley (Twin Falls-Jerome/Burley-Rupert/Sun Valley) KSAW-LD 6 (ABC)\n\nKTFT-LD 7 (NBC)\n\nKMVT 11 (CBS)\n\nKIPT 13 (PBS)\n\nKBAX-LD 27 (RTV)\n\nKXTF 35 (Cozi)\n\nKCJY-LP 38 (JUCE TV)\n\nKSVT-LD 43 (Fox/MNTV)\n\nKCTF-LP 45 (Rel)"
