        "text": "Last Tuesday, I wrote to you that there was lots of talk in the Russian opposition community that a prisoner swap might be imminent. It began when a half-dozen high-profile Russian political prisoners, including Ilya Yashin, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and several Navalny associates vanished from their prison cells, and authorities said the state was not communicating with their families or lawyers as to where they were going. And so it was. On Thursday, in the airports of Ankara and Cologne, 24 people were swapped, capping an immensely complicated logistical and diplomatic process involving seven countries. Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter convicted on made-up charges of spying for the C.I.A., and Paul Whelan, a former Marine also convicted of spying, were among those emancipated.\n\nThe news spotlight has since moved on—there’s the potential war between Israel and Iran, there’s Kamala Harris’s new running mate—but I have found the aftermath of the exchange to be as fascinating as the swap itself, especially how it has played out among Russians.\n\nThe Kremlin spin is particularly noteworthy. Russian state media outlets were given talking points on how to cover the exchange: emphasize the charges for which Gershkovich, Whelan, and the Russian opposition figures were doing time, while highlighting that the Russians being returned had been working honorably for their Motherland. The F.S.B. helped by providing videos of Gershkovich and Whelan’s arrests, which Russian state TV immediately ran. The videos of the Americans, they said, “once again proves their guilt.” In fact, the videos proved something else: that both Gershkovich and Whelan had been set up by the F.S.B. One of the several videos of Evan meeting a source in Yekaterinburg features audio of him telling this person—whose face is blurred, voice is changed, and who is never identified—that he had specifically asked him to keep certain documents at home. The source brought them anyway, calling them “secret materials.” The Kremlin clearly wanted to show that Gershkovich was procuring information not meant for his eyes, but instead showed that it was the source who was sharing it without having been asked—and was therefore most likely an F.S.B. provocateur.\n\nIn Whelan’s case, the released video shows him in the bathroom of his Moscow hotel room. Another man walks in—we can only see him from the back—and hands Whelan something that the American then puts in his pocket. The video then cuts to him handcuffed and sitting on his hotel bed, surrounded by masked, muscly men, as if to say, Q.E.D., he’s guilty. Which is exactly the line that Russian state TV went with, for both Gershkovich and Whelan, leaving unanswered any questions about the contents of the alleged “secret materials” or the identity and motives of these Russian citizens ostensibly passing this information to representatives of a hostile foreign power.\n\nThe Russian prisoners who were sent back to Moscow, meanwhile, were treated as heroes. Vladimir Putin, who greeted them on the tarmac, praised them for faithfully keeping their oaths to the Motherland and said they would all receive government medals for their service. It was a confirmation that most if not all of them had, in fact, been agents of the Russian state.\n\nThe state, in turn, valorized them, especially Vadim Krasikov, who is rumored to be close to Putin and to have once been one of Putin’s bodyguards. (Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he was close not to Putin, but to the other bodyguards protecting the Russian president.) Putin, who had been obsessed with getting Krasikov home, implausibly told Tucker Carlson in February that Krasikov had killed a man in a Berlin park on his own initiative, “out of patriotic considerations.” Russian state TV then went even further, waxing poetic about how Krasikov had withstood his interrogations at the hands of the Germans so thoroughly “that he didn’t even give them his name.” He also, according to state TV, refused to seek clemency or a pardon. “As a result, instead of the traditional pardon, Germany had to process this as a deportation of a foreigner,” the Kremlin’s flagship Channel One boasted. It then went on to say that “the portrait of an unbroken Russian” was only accentuated by the helmet German guards placed on Krasikov’s head as they led him to a bus that would take him to the waiting Russian plane.\n\nIn all the excitement about these Russian patriots returning home, even Maria Butina made an appearance. (Remember the redhead who penetrated the N.R.A. and G.O.P. circles and was then deported from the U.S.? She is now a member of the Russian Parliament and advocates for the rights of prisoners—in American jails.) “I knew in the depths of my heart that I would never be abandoned,” she told Russian state TV, “because Russians don’t abandon their own.”\n\nRussians may not abandon their own, but they do deport them, which, as we found out, is what the Kremlin did to Ilya Yashin, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Ksenia Fadeeva, who once ran one of Alexey Navalny’s campaign offices and was serving a sentence for “extremism” as a result. All three declared that they had not only not wanted to be part of any prisoner swap, they had expressly demanded that their names be removed from any exchange list. All three spoke of knowingly, willfully staying in Russia despite the fact that their political activities would inevitably land them in jail. That means that it was the Kremlin who put the opposition figures on the list, effectively deporting them, Russian citizens, from their own country. This is specifically banned by the Russian Constitution, but when has Putin ever cared about that? In fact, this was the standard practice of the K.G.B. back when Putin was coming of age inside the organization.\n\nAs I said on our The Powers That Be podcast, Putin wasn’t really giving anything up with this trade of Russian political prisoners. In fact, he was cleaning house. Now, these dissidents will not be going on hunger strikes in his penal colonies or writing poignant, principled missives from Russian jails, all of which generated headlines in the West and in the independent Russian press (which a large number of Russians in Russia still read and watch). Instead, they are essentially exiles and therefore, in the eyes of most Russians, totally irrelevant. In fact, in his very first interview after his release, Yashin admitted as much. “I genuinely don’t understand how you can be a part of Russian politics while you are outside Russia’s borders,” he told TV Rain. “While I was in jail, I understood that my words, spoken from jail, … had weight. … Of course, I understand that the very same words spoken from abroad … have a lot less weight.”\n\nThe West might be hoping that the release of Yashin and other Russian political prisoners will reinvigorate the Russian opposition abroad, but Yashin’s first few days of freedom showed just how thoroughly broken that Russian opposition is—and how silly those dreams are. Yashin’s release was greeted with joy by members of the Russian opposition and the Russian independent press—both of which operate in exile—all of whom tried hard to paper over what they’ve known all along: that this young man, who was once close to Boris Nemtsov and Alexey Navalny, was always their less talented little brother.\n\nEvgeny Feldman, who was Navalny’s campaign photographer, followed Yashin around during his first few days in the free world, and the contrast between Feldman’s two subjects couldn’t have been any clearer. Navalny was a charismatic, dominating presence, and photos of him always reflected that. Even after being poisoned, even during his grueling recovery in Germany, Navalny knew how to cut a strong and inspirational image. Yashin, by contrast, appears small, weak, even pathetic. Here he is shopping for toiletries, here he is giving an interview, here he is catching up with friends. He may look relatable, but in none of these images does he look like a leader anyone would want to follow into battle against Putin. Which is why Putin understood that letting Yashin out of the country would do him zero harm, but why the threat posed by Navalny could only be neutralized by his death.\n\nIn fact, in that same TV Rain interview, Yashin committed a grave error, saying that Ukraine should sit down at the negotiating table with Russia—because Ukraine and Russia were losing so many soldiers. The comments put him right in the middle of a debate that has been splitting and convulsing the Russian opposition for the past two years: Are the Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine “our boys” who have been duped and swindled into fighting a criminal war, or are they criminals for fighting in a criminal war? Do they deserve our pity or our scorn? At the same time, for Ukrainians, Yashin’s statement just reinforced two tenets to which they’ve clung since at least February 2022. The first: that the war in Ukraine is not Putin’s war imposed on an unwilling Russian population, but the war of all Russians, one which they either tacitly or wholeheartedly support because they are all neo-imperialists. The second: that the Russian opposition is not to be trusted because they are only against Putin, not for Ukraine—a vital distinction.\n\nIt was an incredibly efficient way to step in it and alienate large numbers of people in his own natural constituency. Which is why one of the photos Feldman shared with Meduza, an independent Russian news organization, really jumped out at me. It showed one of Yashin’s friends holding up an edition of Le Figaro, the front page of which shows a bloodied Trump just after that assassination attempt went sideways. “Now that’s a political animal,” Yashin said in awe, according to the caption. It seemed very much like the statement of someone who, deep down, knows they are not one."
