        "text": "Dmitri Petrov is a young Russian living in Moscow who has been recruited by Henry McCord to work as an undercover spy for the Russian government. He is a computer expert, and his hacking skills make him a valuable asset to the CIA.\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nDuring his time in the Russian military, he studied at the National War College of America under professor Henry McCord. When his sister Talia was diagnosed with cancer, McCord asked Dmitri to accept a deal, admitting Talia to a drug trial in Sweden where she would receive top-of-the-line treatment in exchange for Dmitri to spy on Russia and gather intelligence for the US. Dmitri finally agreed, and first began spying at the Russian embassy in DC for information pertaining to Russian President 's replacement and the planned invasion of Ukraine. After going back to Russia to infiltrate the GRU, Petrov managed to obtain important information regarding the potential invasion of Ukraine that prevented a war between the US, Ukraine, and Russia. However, when Presidents Conrad Dalton and Maria Ostrova were signing a peace treaty, the US had to agree to give up Petrov's name as the spy in exchange for Russia's signing of the deal. While Dmitri was in Switzerland at the signing, Russian officials took custody of him and supposedly executed him. After a while, the McCords found out that Dmitri was still alive, after which a spy swap was negotiated between the countries with Petrov and American spy Peter Buckley (2x23).\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nAfter returning to the US, he was given the cover name Alexander Mirnov and lived in Phoenix while working in IT. Dmitri was prescribed painkillers during this time due to injuries he sustained whlie being toutured in Russian imprisonment. He developed an addiction that would lead him to seek more opioids illegally. He would not fully revover from his addiction for years.\n\nAfter some time in Phoenix Dmitri's cover was nearly broken when, in a fit of rage, he smashed a TV in an IT client's home. He was charged with assault and briefly jailed. Dmitri was frustrated while watching a news report of a terrorist attack. He felt that he couldn't do anything to help the world. Henry McCord assessed that Dmitri was isolated in America and that he was overqualified to work his menial IT cover. Dr. McCord visited Dmitri after the TV smashing incident to assess his mental state, also to bail him out of jail and get him a lawyer. Henry arranged for Dimitri's sister Talia to come to America. Her cover was to be Dmitri's sister. Having his only family with him raised Dmitri's morale, but he still desired to make a positive difference in the world.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nTalia and Dmitri eventually moved to D.C., where, while working with Henry McCord in the Special Activities Division of the CIA (beginning in 4x01), they worked to stop Russia from arming the Taliban. His addiction to painkillers started affecting his work when, during a withdrawal, he cursed out his new CIA colleagues as being pampered and cruel. After this incident Dmitri attended a rehab facility under Henry McCord's recommendation. With the help of Dr. McCord and his sister Dmitri overcame his opioid addiction. One night while visiting Henry McCord's home he met Stephanie McCord. Stephanie was about to go to the opera with her then fiance, Jareth Glover. Later Dmitri encountered Stephanie by chance at a convenience store. Stephanie has just left a fight with Jareth and seemed to have a mutual attraction with Dmitri, who she knew at the time as Alexander. Eventually the two fell in love. After his cover was compromised and Russia found out where he lived, Dmitri moved to Alaska for three years. Dmitri and Stephanie were forced to part ways. However while in exile Dmitri still harbored feelings for Stephanie. Despite his feelings for Stevie he did pursue a brief physical relationship with a local Alaskan woman.\n\nSeason 6[]\n\nLater on he was able to move back to DC after Russia and the US signed an amnesty deal for spies. He and Stevie once again started dating, and they soon both proposed (at the same time) to each other. In the sixth season, the couple searched for a wedding venue and found a rustic one that they both liked. However the wooden furniture in the venue was flammable and the venue burned down before the wedding. The venue burned very soon before the scheduled date and guests had already began arriving. The only locations that could be secured for Stevie's mother, President McCord, in time were, Mt. Weather a windowless nuclear bomb shelter, Camp David which was at the time infested with mosquitos, or the White House. Stevie wasn't very fond of the White House because she knew it would politize her wedding. But she didn't want her mother to be absent, and when the Equal Rights Amendment came into discussion Stevie wanted to use her wedding to sway votes for the important issue. Dmitri and Stevie got married at the White House in the series finale. Former President Conrad Dalton officiated. (6x10)."
