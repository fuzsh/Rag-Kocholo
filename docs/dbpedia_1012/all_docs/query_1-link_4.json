        "text": "One of the Americans not released# today is teacher Marc Fogel,## who was sentenced to 14 years in a# Russian penal colony back in 2022.## He was arrested in 2021 at a Moscow airport# for carrying medically prescribed marijuana.\n\nEarlier this evening, before I spoke with# the deputy national security adviser,## Marc Fogel's sister, Anne,# joined us from her Montana home.\n\nAnne Fogel, thank you for being with us.\n\nANNE FOGEL, Sister of Marc Fogel: Thank## you for having me.\n\nIt's really# important that I tell Marc's story.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: While some families are rejoicing# today as they have been reunited with their## loved ones, your family still has to wait.# How are you doing?\n\nHow are you holding up?\n\nANNE FOGEL: It's been a heart-wrenching 36# hours.\n\nI spoke with Marc yesterday morning## on the phone.\n\nAnd he -- when I realized# that he was still in Rybinsk and everyone## else had been pulled out of their penal# colonies, it was -- my heart really sank.\n\nBut it's really hard to give up hope.\n\nAnd# for the entire day, I roller-coastered,## around thinking that Rybinsk is about# four-and-a-half-hours from Moscow.\n\nAnd## I thought that maybe they would be driving him# down or I -- it was just really hard to let it go.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: When you spoke with him, what did# he say?\n\nWhat did he tell you?\n\nHow is he doing?\n\nANNE FOGEL: He was kind of in the dark.\n\nHe knew## that something was going on.\n\nAnd then# he saw a little bit of news about Paul.\n\nThey're constantly playing the television and# news stations in the penal colony that he's## in.\n\nAnd so he knew something was going on,# but he doesn't speak Russian.\n\nSo he wasn't## exactly sure.\n\nAnd he called.\n\nAnd I didn't# want to -- I know this is crushing him.\n\nSo I didn't want to tell him what I knew.\n\nBut# we -- at that point in time, we were calling## our senators and calling the ambassadors that we# have been in touch with.\n\nAnd we were trying to## get something activated for him.\n\nAnd so it was a# crazy day of phones and messaging and e-mailing.\n\nAnd it's all for naught.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: The national# security adviser, Jake Sullivan,## said today that the administration is working# to secure your brother's release from Russia.\n\nHave you heard anything from the administration?\n\nANNE FOGEL: No, we have never heard# from the administration.\n\nI did talk## to -- my sister-in-law and I did talk# to Jake Sullivan about two years ago.\n\nBut Marc has never been prioritized.\n\nHe# had -- he was convicted under the same## code as Brittney Griner, but he was never# designated as wrongfully detained.\n\nAnd we## don't have the NBA behind us and we don't# have The Wall Street Journal behind us,## so it's been very difficult# for us to get our man out.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Your mother, your 95-year-old# mother, filed a lawsuit in June against the## U.S. State Department over its failure to# declare Marc Fogel as wrongfully detained.\n\nWhy do you think he hasn't# received that designation## and how has it complicated efforts,# in your view, to secure his release?\n\nANNE FOGEL: I don't think he's been# designated because I don't think he's## important enough.\n\nAs I said, we just don't# have the notoriety, the celebrity status.\n\nAnd, believe me, the worst part of# this process is being pitted against## other Americans.\n\nI don't want that.\n\nNo# one wants that.\n\nMarc doesn't want that.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: When we started our# conversation, you said you wanted## to get your brother's story out.\n\nWhat do you# want folks to know about your brother Marc?\n\nANNE FOGEL: I want you to know that Marc# has had an outsized impact on the world,## essentially, because he has taught# internationally for so many years.\n\nHe has thousands of students that he has taught,# and he is -- there's not a hall of fame for## teaching, but he is the best of the best.\n\nAnd# you have one of his students in your newsroom,## as we speak.\n\nHe has students all over the# world writing to him, praying for him,## making movies about him.\n\nWe need justice.\n\nHe needs# to come home.\n\nHe needs to be with his family.\n\nHis life and sons need him.\n\nAnd this# is absolutely unfair that they did not## bring him home with the greatest historic# prisoner swap since the World War.\n\nI wish I## could be more steady perhaps in saying these# things, but I feel very wronged for Marc.\n\nAnd he needs to come home, and the# Biden administration has nothing## to lose.\n\nThey should have brought him home.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Anne Fogel,# our thoughts are with you,## your family and your brother Marc.\n\nThanks again# for your time this evening.\n\nWe appreciate it.\n\nANNE FOGEL: Thank you for having me."
