Because we don’t know what’s happening on the territories where active combat is ongoing right now,” Oleksandr Khorunzhiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s State Emergency Service, said.\n\n“Just imagine the number of bombs that have been dropped on us by the enemy,” the official told a news conference.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 14:13 GMT\n\n‘Russia has stolen our peace’: Zelenskyy to Glastonbury crowds\n\nZelenskyy has urged music fans at the Glastonbury Festival to “spread the truth about Russia’s war” on his country.\n\nSpeaking to the crowd at the British music extravaganza by video before a set by The Libertines, Zelenskyy said, “We in Ukraine would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer, but we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened – Russia has stolen our peace.”\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 14:03 GMT\n\nPoland wants NATO to strengthen defences in Suwalki Gap, says PM\n\nPoland and the Baltic states want to see a stronger NATO defensive presence in the Suwalki Gap, the stretch of land that separates the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad from Belarus, the Polish prime minister has said.\n\n“We are going to seek the reinforcement of this corridor … in our talks with our partners from NATO,” Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference in Brussels after an EU summit.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 14:01 GMT\n\nIAEA voices concern for staff at nuclear plant, demands access\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency is increasingly concerned about the welfare of Ukrainian staff at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, it has said, adding that it must go there as soon as possible.\n\n“The IAEA is aware of recent reports in the media and elsewhere indicating a deteriorating situation for Ukrainian staff at the country’s largest nuclear power plant,” a statement by the Vienna-based United Nations agency said.\n\nIt added that it was “increasingly concerned about the difficult conditions facing staff … and it must go there as soon as possible to address this and other urgent issues”.\n\n“The situation at this major nuclear power plant is clearly untenable. We are informed that Ukrainian staff are operating the facility under extremely stressful conditions while the site is under the control of Russian armed forces,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in the statement.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 13:59 GMT\n\nRussia trying but unable to impede weapons flow to Ukraine: US official\n\nRussia is trying but has been unable to target Western weapons flowing into Ukraine, including longer-range systems that Kyiv hopes will be decisive on the battlefield, a senior US defence official has said.\n\nThe official also appeared to play down the significance of Russian advances in Ukraine and said a Ukrainian pullback from Severodonetsk would allow them to take a better defensive position.\n\n“In moving the Ukrainian armed forces from Sievierodonetsk back, what they are doing is putting themselves in a position where they can better defend themselves,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 12:07 GMT\n\nKyiv: Russia seeking to surround Lysychansk, capture Severodonetsk\n\nUkraine’s defence ministry says Russian forces are seeking to surround the embattled city of Lysychansk and are mounting assaults on its sister city of Severodonetsk to establish full control.\n\nThe region’s governor said earlier that Ukrainian troops would “have to be withdrawn” from Severodonetsk and that they had been ordered to take up new positions.\n\nDefence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk declined to comment on the governor’s remarks and told reporters at a briefing in Kyiv that the information was “closed” to the public.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 11:53 GMT\n\nG7 countries agree Russia responsible for global food crisis: Japan minister\n\nJapanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi says G7 foreign ministers agree that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had brought about the current global food crisis, and Moscow was responsible for the matter.\n\nHayashi made the comment to reporters after a G7 foreign ministers’ meeting, in which he had participated remotely.\n\nJapan intends to support grain exports from Ukraine and plans to look into further food assistance to respond to the crisis, Hayashi said.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 11:33 GMT\n\nCzech Republic cannot ‘rule out’ Russia gas shipments fall or stop\n\nIndustry minister Jozef Sikela says gas shipments coming from Russia into the Czech Republic are stable but need monitoring.\n\nSikela said Prague could not rule out that shipments could fall or completely stop in the future.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 10:49 GMT\n\nRussia sends coupon payment in roubles on dollar-denominated Eurobond: Ministry\n\nRussia’s finance ministry says it has sent a coupon payment of 8.5 billion roubles ($159m) on a dollar-denominated Eurobond issue to the National Settlement Depository, as the prospect of a sovereign default draws ever closer.\n\n“Obligations on servicing the state securities of the Russian Federation were fulfilled by the finance ministry in full,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Eurobond in question matures in 2028. Similar coupon payments were made on Thursday on bonds maturing in 2027 and 2047.\n\nRussia has been struggling to make payments on its $40bn of international bonds since being hit with sweeping sanctions after sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 10:39 GMT\n\nRussian forces in full control of Hirske district: Local official\n\nOleksiy Babchenko – head of Hirske municipality, says Russian forces have “fully occupied” the district in eastern Luhansk region.\n\n“Unfortunately, as of today … the entire Hirske district is occupied,” Babchenko said on a television broadcast.\n\n“There are some insignificant, local battles going on at the outskirts, but the enemy has entered,” he added.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 09:36 GMT\n\nUN chief: World facing ‘catastrophe’ from global food shortage\n\nThe head of the UN says the world faces a “catastrophe” because of the growing shortage of food around the globe.\n\nAntonio Guterres said the war in Ukraine has added to the disruptions caused by climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and inequality to produce an “unprecedented global hunger crisis” already affecting hundreds of millions of people.\n\n“There is a real risk that multiple famines will be declared in 2022,” he said in a video message to officials from dozens of rich and developing countries gathered in Berlin.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 09:17 GMT\n\nGermany looking at converting part of Nord Stream 2 for LNG link: Der Spiegel\n\nThe German economy ministry is considering converting parts of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline into a connection for a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic Sea coast, magazine Der Spiegel reports.\n\nThe ministry is looking at possibly expropriating the part of the pipeline system located on German territory and cutting it off from the rest of the pipeline, Spiegel added.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 09:07 GMT\n\nRussian-installed Kherson official assassinated: Official\n\nThe deputy head of the Russian-installed authority in Kherson region says a senior official of the administration has been killed in an apparent assassination.\n\nDmitry Savluchenko, head of families, youth and sports department of the Kherson military-civilian administration, was killed in a bomb blast, the deputy head told Reuters news agency.\n\nRussia’s TASS news agency said there were two burned-out cars in a courtyard of Kherson – the regional capital where the blast took place – and that the windows of a four-storey house had been shattered.\n\nKherson sits just northwest of the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula and was occupied during the first week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 08:28 GMT\n\nUS to blame Kaliningrad transit restrictions: Russia\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry says it blames Washington for a Lithuanian ban on sanctioned goods crossing from the Russian mainland to the exclave of Kaliningrad.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry also said that it was “impossible” to hold expert-level consultations with Washington on a number of bilateral issues that had been due to take place in the near future.\n\nThe ministry did not specify which issues it was referring to, or when talks were supposed to take place.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 08:11 GMT\n\nUkraine war: Is Kazakhstan going cool on Russia?\n\nKazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is publicly refusing to recognise Moscow-backed separatist regions in Ukraine.\n\n“If the right to self-determination is implemented worldwide, there will be over 600 nations instead of the 193 states that are currently UN members. Of course, that would be chaos,” Tokayev said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 07:39 GMT\n\nGermany plans aid for energy-intensive industry: Sueddeutsche Zeitung\n\nGermany is planning to provide several billion dollars in tax relief to the energy-intensive industry in the coming two years, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reports, citing a finance ministry paper.\n\nThe aid would amount to some $3.05bn annually in the years 2023 and 2024, Sueddeutsche reported.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 07:20 GMT\n\nGazprom gas exports to Europe via Ukraine decreases\n\nGazprom, the Russian gas producer, says its supply of gas to Europe through Ukraine via the Sudzha entry point was seen at 42.1 million cubic metres (mcm) on Friday versus 42.6 mcm on Thursday.\n\nAn application to supply gas via another major entry point, Sokhranovka, was again rejected by Ukraine, Gazprom said.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 06:57 GMT\n\nEnergy costs could triple in Germany: Network regulator\n\nGerman consumers could see a doubling or tripling of their energy costs, which, in some cases, are already between 30 and 80 percent higher due to price increases from last autumn, the head of the Bundesnetzagentur network regulator, has told broadcaster ARD.\n\nThe regulator has considered various scenarios, Klaus Mueller said, and most of them “are not pretty, and mean either too little gas at the end of winter or already very difficult situations in autumn or winter”.\n\nGermany triggered the second of three phases of its emergency gas plan on Thursday, which kicks in when the government sees a high risk of long-term supply shortages of gas.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 06:42 GMT\n\nGerman economy minister warns of industry shutdown amid gas shortage: Der Spiegel\n\nGermany is heading for a gas shortage if Russian gas supplies remain as low as they are now, and certain industries would have to be shut down if there is not enough come winter, the economy minister has said.\n\n“Companies would have to stop production, lay off their workers, supply chains would collapse, people would go into debt to pay their heating bills, that people would become poorer,” Robert Habeck told Der Spiegel magazine, saying it was part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategy to divide the country.\n\nThis is “the best breeding ground for populism, which is intended to undermine our liberal democracy from within,” Habeck said, adding that Putin’s plans must not be allowed to work out.\n\nHabeck held out the prospect of further relief for companies and people affected by the lack of gas but warned that it would not be possible to absorb all the effects, reported Der Spiegel.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 05:51 GMT\n\nUkrainian forces will have to leave embattled Severodonetsk: Governor\n\nUkrainian troops will “have to be withdrawn” from the mostly Russian-occupied battleground city of Severodonetsk, the Luhansk governor said on television on Friday.\n\n“Remaining in positions smashed to pieces over many months just for the sake of staying there does not make sense,” Serhiy Haidai said.\n\nHe did not indicate whether troops would be withdrawn immediately, or over what time frame the withdrawal would happen.\n\nThe UK’s defence ministry said on Thursday some Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from Lysychansk to avoid being encircled. If Russia takes both Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, it will hold the Luhansk region, which is one of the two regions that make up the Donbas.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 05:18 GMT\n\nRussian forces captured another village near Lysychansk: Governor\n\nRussian forces have taken the village of Mykolaivka, around 25km south of the key city of Lysychansk, the governor of Luhansk has said.\n\nSerhiy Haidai said Ukraine’s forces repulsed a Russian attack on Lysychansk, and the nearby village of Borivske, on Thursday.\n\nHe said the Russian army fired on Severodonetsk with “all available weapons” as well as the nearby villages of Bila Hora, Vovchoyarivka, Synetskyi and Pavlohrad.\n\n“The enemy’s offensive near Borivske was successfully stopped. In addition, our soldiers repulsed the offensive in the direction of the southern outskirts of Lysychansk. However … Russians managed to capture Mykolaivka,” Haidai said.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 04:55 GMT\n\nRussian air force likely lacks trained pilots for Ukraine invasion: UK\n\nThe Russian air force is likely struggling to support its Ukraine offensive with sufficient aircrew, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence has said, citing recent Ukrainian information about a captured pilot flying a Russian plane who confessed to being a military contractor with the private Wagner army.\n\n“Ukrainian forces have announced that the pilot of a Russian Su-25 FROGFOOT ground attack aircraft shot down on 17 June was captured shortly afterwards,” the defence ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing.\n\n“The pilot has confessed to being a former Russian air force Major, who had taken employment as a Wagner military contractor and had flown several missions during the conflict,” it said, adding that this indicated a lack of sufficient aircrew in the Russian air forces.\n\n“This is likely due to a combination of Russia’s insufficient numbers of suitably trained personnel and its combat losses,” the ministry said.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 04:13 GMT\n\nEnergy provider says Germany should boost domestic gas production\n\nGermany should explore all options to increase domestic natural gas output including fracking, the chief executive of German energy provider E.ON has said, as Berlin triggered the “alarm stage” of its emergency gas plan in response to falling Russian supplies.\n\n“We must now search without taboos for all solutions that will help us to improve our situation” Leonhard Birnbaum said in an interview with the WirtschaftsWoche podcast.\n\nBirnbaum said a modest increase in domestic production would not be the solution to the current supply situation, but a small building block that could help.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 04:06 GMT\n\nKyiv likely preparing for loss of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk: ISW\n\nUkrainian authorities are likely setting conditions to prepare for the ultimate loss of both key Luhansk cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, but this outcome would not represent a turning point in the war, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has said.\n\nLuhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said on Thursday Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from some areas near Lysychansk to avoid being surrounded, which the ISW said indicated preparations on behalf of Kyiv for the loss of the territory. But the ISW said taking Severodonetsk would not be a decisive victory for Russia.\n\n“Ukrainian troops have succeeded for weeks in drawing substantial quantities of Russian personnel, weapons, and equipment into the area and have likely degraded Russian forces’ overall capabilities while preventing Russian forces from focusing on more advantageous axes of advance,” the Washington-based think-tank said.\n\n“Russian offensive operations will likely stall in the coming weeks, whether or not Russian forces capture the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area, likely granting Ukrainian forces the opportunity to launch prudent counteroffensives,” it added.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 03:13 GMT\n\nRussia cancels Kaliningrad power network isolation test\n\nRussia’s power grid told Litgrid, its counterpart in Lithuania, that it has cancelled the planned isolation operation test of the electricity network of the Kaliningrad exclave, Litgrid has said.\n\nThe test, which was due to begin on Saturday, would have involved Kaliningrad region disconnecting from the common grid of Baltic states, Russia and Poland for eight hours to test its capacity to operate independently, Litgrid said. Three similar tests were conducted in 2019-2021, it said.\n\nBaltic states expect to decouple from the common grid in 2025, necessitating Kaliningrad, sandwiched between NATO members Poland and Lithuania, to operate on its own.\n\nLithuania’s president told Reuters on Wednesday his country is ready for Russia to try to kick it off the grid imminently, as a punishment for blocking cargo sanctioned by the EU from travelling from mainland Russia to the exclave.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 03:03 GMT\n\nRussia’s Canada embassy spars with Germany’s ambassador\n\nThe Russian embassy in Canada has responded with scorn to social media remarks by Germany’s ambassador to Ottawa which claimed Russia was using energy as a weapon.\n\n“This is a rough road our country will have to walk,” Germany’s Sabine Sparwasser wrote on Twitter after Europe’s biggest economy moved to phase two of its gas emergency plans in the wake of Russia slashing supplies. “Russia is using energy as a weapon against Europe.”\n\nRussia’s embassy countered that Europe had backed itself into a corner with its ban on Russian energy.\n\n“Europe got cornered by its own sanctions’ policy, declares intent to cut itself from Russian oil & gas, dubs Russia [as an] adversary and wants to suffocate Russia’s economy while still buying gas. At the same time claiming that Russia uses energy as a weapon. Did we miss something Ambassador @s_sparwasser?,” the embassy said in a tweet.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 02:16 GMT\n\nRussia to ‘carefully record’ Ukraine’s use of Western weapons: Spokesman\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman has said that Russia’s defence ministry is carefully recording each use of weapons provided by the US to Ukraine to ensure they aren’t being used to strike inside Russia, state media channel RT has reported.\n\n“We carefully record all episodes of the use of these weapons,” Dmitry Peskov said. “So, if any of these weapons reach the front lines and are not destroyed by our military, we will track how they are being used.”\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 01:48 GMT\n\nUS senator calls for review into Russian airlines’ safety\n\nUS Senator Marco Rubio on Thursday asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct a safety review of Russian airlines and alert Americans to the risks of Russian-administered aircraft continuing to operate in international airspace.\n\nSanctions imposed by Europe, the US and others have denied Russia access to new planes, spare parts and maintenance services and forced Russia’s aviation industry to cut back on flights.\n\n“So long as Russian airlines maintain such operations, they pose a potential threat to international travellers, as well as to Russians flying domestically,” Rubio wrote.\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 01:43 GMT\n\nRussian forces aiming to take another settlement near Severodonetsk: Army\n\nRussian forces are aiming to capture another settlement near the city of Severodonetsk, Ukraine’s general staff has said.\n\nAfter taking control of the villages of Loskutivka and Rai-Oleksandrivka near Lysychansk on Thursday, Russians are set on taking Syrotyne, on the outskirts of Severodonetsk, according to Ukraine’s army. Syrotyne is near the settlement of Metolkine, which Russian forces took control of earlier in the week.\n\nLuhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai told The Associated Press that the Russians were “burning everything out” in their offensive to encircle Ukraine’s fighters.\n\n“The Russians are advancing without trying to spare the ammunition or troops, and they aren’t running out of either,” Haidai said. “They have an edge in heavy artillery and the number of troops.”\n\n24 Jun 2022 - 01:34 GMT\n\nBoris Johnson signals UK’s willingness to help export grain from Ukraine: Reuters\n\nThe UK is willing to assist with demining operations off Ukraine’s southern coast and is considering offering insurance to ships to move millions of tonnes of grain stuck in the country, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.\n\nTurkey is trying to broker talks between the UN, Ukraine and Russia to create a possible safe sea corridor in the Black Sea, but Moscow wants some Western sanctions lifted first to facilitate its grain and fertiliser exports.\n\n“There is a job of work to be done.
