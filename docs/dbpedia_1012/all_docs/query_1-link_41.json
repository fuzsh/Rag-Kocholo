        "text": "A huge fire has engulfed a research center in Moscow that develops radio-electronic systems for Russia's Defense Ministry, videos circulating on social media show.\n\nThe blaze at the Platan Research Institute, located in the town of Fryazino in the Moscow region, was reported by local media and several Russian Telegram channels, including Mash, which purports to have links to Russia's security services.\n\n\"The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth floors are on fire,\" Mash said on Monday, sharing a video of the blaze.\n\nThe governor of the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, was cited by Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti as saying that three of the building's floors were engulfed in flames.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Russia's Defense Ministry for comment by email.\n\nThe Context\n\nThere have been a string of mysterious fires in Russia since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Ukraine rarely claims responsibility for attacks on Russian soil.\n\nWhat We Know\n\nRussia's Ministry of Emergency Situations said that firefighters were rescuing people from smoke-filled rooms.\n\n\"Efforts are focused on saving people and extinguishing the fire in Fryazino,\" the ministry said. \"Work is complicated by high temperatures and dense smoke.\"\n\nAccording to the Baza Telegram channel, nine people were trapped in the building due to the blaze. The Caution News Telegram channel published a video of a man waving to rescuers from the window of a burning building.\n\nBaza published a video showing huge plumes of black smoke engulfing the building. It said \"something exploded\" in the research center.\n\n\"The building is completely [engulfed] in smoke...the fire area is 3,500 square meters,\" it said.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unclear and no casualties have been reported at the time of writing.\n\nViews\n\n\"For 57 years, the Platan Research Institute outside Moscow made tech for Russia's global killing machine, until today,\" wrote the \"Jay in Kyiv\" X (formerly Twitter) account. The account is linked to the Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation, which specializes in helping the Ukrainian Defense Forces and civilians affected by the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nThe account shared videos of the burning building.\n\n\"Near Moscow the Platan Research Institute is on fire. The research institute develops electronics, semiconductor lasers, screens, etc. for the Russian Ministry of Defense and others,\" Jason Jay Smart, an expert on post-Soviet politics, wrote on X.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nThe press service of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said more than 100 people and 40 pieces of equipment are currently involved in extinguishing the blaze."
