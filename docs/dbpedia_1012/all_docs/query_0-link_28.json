        "text": "On now\n\nMy Floating Home\n\nBIG CITY LIVING, NORTH VANCOUVER, CANADA\n\nA young couple builds a dream floating ‘starter home’ to moor in a marina that has stunning water views. This young couple, Aaron and Heather, spend their time sailing in Vancouver harbour looking at the multi million dollar float homes in downtown marinas. They always thought float home living was an impossible dream but they find a company at Creek Marina who can build them an affordable floating starter home and so they take the plunge. It has stunning 360 views of the Vancouver Mountains on one side, with the Vancouver Skyline on the other. On their wish list is an office for Heather to work at home from, and an exterior cantilevered fireplace to save space within the open concept living, dining and kitchen upstairs area. Works starts with the float being poured in 2 halves and then joined together in the water. Then the house is built on top of the float in a tradition wood frame style. Once finished it launches in front of the Vancouver skyline and is towed by tug to its mooring, a nerve wracking moment. The final fittings include a stunning fireplace and a top spec kitchen with rare Italian marble tiles. Aaron and Heather take us through their finished home, its lower floor bedrooms, its sun decks and its huge multi use living area with marina views from every seat in the house\n\nUp next\n\nBrojects\n\nUltimate Swim Raft\n\nSwimming in the lake is an essential part of the cottage experience but the brothers need a swim raft….the ultimate swim raft. Andrew and Kevin retreat to the drawing board eager to fix the situation. They quickly come to the conclusion that their new swim raft will need to be self-propelled so that it can be moored both at the shore as well as in the middle of the lake where the swimming is prime. Together with their engineer pal Walker, the boys decide to build the Ultimate Swim Raft, complete with benches, a cedar pergola, a hammock, a solar-powered motor, a trap-door cooler, a retractable anchor.\n\nBrojects\n\nUltimate Outdoor Theatre\n\nFrustrated by the poor movie watching experience inside the cottage, Brothers Andrew and Kevin dream of having an outdoor movie theatre setup, and this weekend they set out to realize that dream. They want something that is portable, can be hidden when not in use, is protected from the elements, can function as a music system when not being used to watch movies, and above all, is easy to set up and take down. Settle back with a bag of popcorn and watch as the brothers, together with some help from Walker, premiere their Ultimate Outdoor Theatre.\n\nBlack Gold\n\nThe Hole from Hell\n\nThe roughnecks of Big Dog 28 are on schedule to make their goal of 4 holes in 50 days… something no one thought could be done. But the third hole is proving to be much harder than the first two. The crews dub it “The Hole from Hell.” Pee Wee’s daylight crew takes the brunt of the problems. Equipment fails, injuries slow the crew, and tempers flare as hot as the west Texas sun. Pee Wee continues to struggle with Cheston. Even Gerald turns on the worm. And Ron’s evening crew isn’t immune to problems on the rig. He loses a good hand to another company and must break in a new guy who calls himself “Tank,” but Tank’s brawn is rendered unless when he forgets his boots on the first day. Things go from bad to worse when the drill pipe “twists off” and drilling comes to a standstill. Then, it’s a race to repair Big Dog 28… and with every passing minute, the roughnecks get further from their goal of “4 in 50” and closer to losing their jobs.\n\nBlack Gold\n\nPromotion Perils\n\nThe crews of Big Dog 28 have been charged with the near impossible task of drilling four holes in fifty days. If the crews can’t make the deadline, the company will lose the drilling leases on their remaining two wells that will be worth two hundred million in oil revenue – lose the lease, lose the company. On the day crew, the rig’s worm Cheston finally gets in the good graces of his hotheaded driller Pee Wee. The two find common ground just long enough for Cheston to get a promotion, but as he will soon find out: with the new position, come new dangers. The nervous worm will have to use everything he’s learned if he expects to keep his fingers intact. On the night crew, driller Ron Pane is finding his hulking roughneck Tank’s attitude harder to manage. As the ex-prizefighter is forced into scrubbing duty, Tank’s ego is pushed to the edge, but hurt feelings are the least of Ron’s problems. Tool pusher Freddy plays on Ron’s and graveyard crew driller Pete’s worst superstitious fear with pranks that may have put a bad omen on the rig. After a series of problems cripple 28, Freddy is forced to rethink his actions. Off the rig, Josh grapples with the tough hours of the roughneck lifestyle as he tries to keep buxom Midland Roughneck’s cheerleader, Sydney, from slipping through his fingers. He hopes a late-night dip in the pool and a west Texas-style barbecue will do the trick. Back on 28 – the rig is plagued with mechanical problems and there is plenty of blame to go around. The rig isn’t drilling, and Big Dog owner Autry Stephens won’t stand by for long before he decides to shut this operation down and fire the crew."
