        "text": "2As the title of her book indicates, Napoli’s book is centered on two main subjects: Ted Turner and the birth of CNN. The latter would engender the 24-hour news cycle, a major media revolution that would forever after alter the face of the TV news landscape.\n\n4In Chapter one “The Little Girl in the Well, 1949” the reader learns about the personal interest story of a little girl who has fallen into a well and the ensuing rescue operation involving the active participation of the community and the local news. The chapter highlights the attention drawn to the local event and the publicity for the emerging medium of television. “It was television history. Never before had it been possible to watch an event unfold, live, without physically being present....That people who had no connection to the family or the area had become so consumed by the drama was a jolting indicator that a mass medium had been born” (11). However, not only did it mark TV history but also the need for a possible 24-hour news channel to cover extensively such a story and the limits of the news media in 1949.\n\n5Chapter two “The Lunatic Fringe” takes us on a historical tour of TV and TV channels in the 1960s where “….the plum broadcast real estate, stations numbered two to thirteen on the powerful VHF, or ‘very high frequency,’ of the airwaves, had been doled out. Dials on most older televisions—that is, most televisions in operation—stopped at the number thirteen” (18). The chapter also introduces the reader to Jack Rice and Bill Tush. The former founded TV station WJRJ TV channel 17 located on the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) of the airwaves referred to as the “Lunatic Fringe” because of their limited range and thus limited viewership, and the latter would go on to be the future newsman for this channel. Turner then acquired it, diversifying his father’s billboard business and planting the seeds for what would become CNN. The other strands that Napoli weaves into this chapter are the dramatic events of Turner’s early life, his turbulent relationship with his alcoholic father, the trauma of his ailing sister who eventually died of Lupus at 17, his own personal battles with alcohol and his father’s suicide when Ted was only 24. These events plus his own personal idiosyncrasies forged his character and drive. “The more people said something couldn’t be done—or that Ted Turner couldn’t do it—the deeper he plunged in. A wild risk taker was the perfect fit, perhaps the only fit, for a station on the lunatic fringe” (34). The chapter ends by building on this description of Turner as a crazy risk taker, recounting an incident where he climbed the broadcasting tower of channel 17 shouting that he wants to reach the moon.\n\n7When channel 17 was launched on January 1, 1970 Turner had chosen the call sign WTCG which stood for “Turner Communications Group” though Ted claimed it meant “Watch This Channel Grow!” the title given to chapter 4. The action in this chapter takes place a few years before the meeting between Schonfeld and Turner in chapter 3. The author unravels the CNN origin story but in a more traditional Bildungsroman narrative arc by exploring the early days of channel 17 when it was a scrappy young UHF “lunatic fringe” TV station rated number 4 out of 4 among the local UHF channels. The sordid working conditions and shoestring budget are described in painstaking detail as well as the innovative and aggressive approaches Turner used to “transform channel 17 from ‘shit to shinola’ as he described it” (61) and make the channel grow. He decided to occupy all 24 hours of the day with TV programs on the channel instead of signing off late at night. He broadcast reruns, old movies nobody wanted, Georgia wrestling and even became the first UHF station to carry Major League baseball signing a contract with the Atlanta Braves. Channel 17 even carried out a master coup in landing a deal with the infamous direct advertisement Ginsu knife infomercial franchise. Napoli then chronicles how Turner tasked Bill Tush to become the first news anchor for channel 17. Having absolutely no experience Tush winged it and in the end settled on doing a light-hearted version of the news, constantly breaking the fourth wall, joking with the cameramen while on air, and doing self-deprecating things at the same time he read the news. Chapter 4 then explores the budding cable revolution and especially the game changing ruling that would lift channel 17 out of obscurity: “the FCC handed down an industry-altering edict. Cable operators, they decreed, could import the nearest independent station as a bonus offering to their customers…. Within a year, its viewership would triple” (80).\n\n8If the previous chapters had not made it clear that Ted Turner, “the mouth of the south” (88) is an outsized character, a reckless risk taker, a delusional egomaniac and according to others just downright wacko, chapter five “Captain Outrageous” explicitly makes the case. Knowing absolutely nothing about baseball he decides to purchase the Atlanta Braves. The rest of the chapter is about his antics as the Braves’ new owner, his subsequent equally dubious purchase of the basketball team the Atlanta Hawks who like the Braves were in last place, his non-stop philandering often while drunk, and ends by recounting how he defended the America’s Cup in 1977 beating Australia 4-0. The one constant in Turner’s life was his love of water and skill at sailing. After the win Turner was once again drunk.\n\n9After the wild antics of Turner in the previous chapter, chapter six “No News Is Good News” starts off by picking up the narrative arc of Reese Schonfeld that was left hanging in chapter 3. It is 1975, TVN is history and Schonfeld now works for the Independent TV News Association (ITNA), a wire service that provides footage and filmed stories from around the nation to nine subscribing independent stations. However, Turner’s channel resisted because Ted felt that news was depressing and that people wanted escapism. The author continues the Schonfeld saga by introducing newsmen Reese met at ITNA, Ted Kavanau, Daniel Schorr and Burt Reinhardt, three additional supporting characters in the CNN origin arc who will help Schonfeld later launch CNN. But before that happens, Napoli presents the next episode of the Turner saga. Ted has just had a personal epiphany realizing that news is not such a bad idea after all, because he would not have to pay for the rights, thus making it cheaper than entertainment. He decides to start a 24-hour news cable network and promptly seeks out the only newsman he knows who could make it work: Reese Schonfeld. He agrees to come on board and with Ted they seek support from the 5000 other existing cable operators. Unfortunately, Turner’s Captain outrageous persona precedes him: “The TV critic for the Charlotte Observer…summed up everyone’s misgivings about Ted’s foray into broadcast journalism saying it was like ‘Attila the Hun deciding he’s going to do a summer camp for the elderly’” (128). Turner will have to launch CNN alone without their support.\n\n10Chapter 7 “Every Drop of Blood” is about even more difficult obstacles standing in the way of Ted’s project. The title refers to one of the most challenging ones. The satellite responder provided by RCA went missing three months before the launch of CNN and RCA would not provide any of the stranded channels access on their other two satellites. This would mean that upon CNN’s launch they would be beaming from another satellite that could not be received by anyone because they were tuned only to the RCA satellite. Or as the author puts it RCA was “offering up an eight-track tape machine on which to play an LP when your turntable died” (154). This launch into obscurity meant CNN would be doomed to failure. Upon hearing the bad news from RCA Turner flew into a rage: “I’m a small company, and you guys may put me out of business. This is my death if you do this to me. This is my blood you’re getting. For every drop of blood I shed,” he roared, “you will shed a barrel” (154). Other notable obstacles included a moment when Turner was thought to be dead after a dangerous European yacht race whose stormy conditions had decimated two thirds of the competition and killed 19 participants. In the end, not only did Ted survive, but he won the race, serving up a neat allegory for the future launch of CNN. Aside from the problems, channel 17 would also have to undergo a huge cultural shift. Bill Tush, whom Turner referred to as his “low-budget Walter Cronkite” (138), would still have a job presenting the news “but the unorthodox news shenanigans simply had to stop. No more reading the headlines in a bunny suit. No more sermons from Brother Gold; goodbye, special reports from the News Chicken. From that day forward, Bill Tush would have to play it straight.” (139).\n\n11Chapter eight “Reese’s Pieces” focuses on this period of transition and the actions carried out by the future president of CNN Reese Schonfeld. Ted had given him free rein to cobble or “piece” together the future team at CNN and he promptly went to work hiring colleagues who could work as guerilla newsmen to defend this new cable David that would take on the Big Three Goliaths. College interns who would work for peanuts were brought in. New hires with previous substance abuse or harassment problems, referred to by Reese as “rehab projects” (170), were welcome as well.\n\n14Chapter 11 “The Little Girl in the Well, 1987” neatly circles back to a similar incident in 1949 recounted in chapter 1. However, 38 years later this would no longer be seen as just a local event but a worldwide production seen by millions stressing the evolution of technology and the reduction of space: “A symphony of horns alerted the people of Midland that one of their own was safe. But the reverie was superfluous. No one needed to go outside to know what had happened. Thanks to television, all over town and all around the planet, millions of people already knew. That night, CNN scored its highest ratings ever” (237). Indeed, CNN had become a global phenomenon: “‘They are watching us in Moscow right now, in Havana, in London,’ Ted bragged as deal after intoxicating deal was signed to beam CNN around the globe—Canada, Australia, Japan, Mexico, China” (234). This chapter informs the reader of two other important developments in the Turnerverse: Reese Schonfeld had been fired by Turner 5 years earlier in 1982 and Turner had now settled down with his third wife Jane Fonda."
