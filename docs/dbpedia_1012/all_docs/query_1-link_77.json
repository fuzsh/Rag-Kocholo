Hurley, the Dragon's commander, prepared to take manual control for a brief test, then shift the capsule into automatic for the linkup, 19 hours after liftoff. In case of a problem, the astronauts slipped back into their pressurized launch suits for the docking. The three space station residents trained cameras on the incoming capsule for flight controllers at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, as well as NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nUPDATE: At 7:16 PST, soft capture was successfully completed. We are now \"moments away\" from their boarding, with an official \"welcoming ceremony\" expected to happen soon."
