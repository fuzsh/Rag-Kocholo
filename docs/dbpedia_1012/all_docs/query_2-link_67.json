        "text": "Men detained at St. Petersburg Navalny vigils were handed military draft summonses, monitoring group says\n\nSome of the men detained at vigils for Alexey Navalny in St. Petersburg, Russia, were handed military draft summonses, OVD-Info, an independent Russian human rights group that monitors repression in the country, said in a Telegram post on Wednesday.\n\nPro-Kremlin military blogger dead days after reporting massive Russian losses in Avdiivka\n\nA pro-Kremlin Russian military blogger, Andrey Morozov, has reportedly died just days after he reported that Russia had suffered massive losses during its assault on the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka. Several well-informed pro-Russian military bloggers as well as Russian state news agencies and newspapers reported he had died by suicide.\n\nWhat was he writing about: Morozov, known as “Murz” on Telegram, claimed Moscow had lost around 16,000 soldiers and 300 armored vehicles since it started its assault in October. CNN cannot verify Morozov’s estimates. That post drew severe criticism from several Russian propagandists and has since been deleted from his Telegram account.\n\nHere’s what he said in his last few posts:\n\nHe announced his apparent intention to take his life, calling on his readers not to mourn him and asking that he be buried in the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) — the Russian name for the Ukrainian region of Luhansk, whose annexation by Moscow is considered illegal by most of the international community.\n\nMorozov complained he was being bullied because of his report about Avdiivka and said he was ordered to delete the post by someone he described as “Comrade Colonel.”\n\nHe also shared his will and complained about the shortage of weapons for Russian troops at the front.\n\nWhy this matters: Pro-Russian military bloggers have enjoyed some freedom to criticize the Russian military and the way the Ministry of Defense was prosecuting the war in Ukraine. After the failed uprising by former Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, Moscow began to crack down on dissent among ultra-nationalist writers, most notably arresting former soldier and also military blogger Igor Girkin.\n\nPutin decorates soldiers for capturing Ukrainian town of Avdiivka\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin awarded medals to Russian soldiers on Wednesday as the military continues to celebrate its victory in capturing the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka after Ukrainian forces withdrew.\n\nPutin traveled to the Chkalovskiy airfield outside Moscow to award state honors to the soldiers from the Air and Space Forces, according to a Kremlin statement on Wednesday.\n\nAddressing the soldiers, Putin thanked them for their “courage and bravery” in displaying “the highest skill in accomplishing their tasks.”\n\nThe Russian leader was met by his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, who presented a brief report, according to the statement.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Russia’s army chief, Army Gen. Valery Gerasimov, visited troops near the front line in eastern Ukraine and presented awards to soldiers who participated in the assault of Avdiivka, the Russian Ministry of Defense said.\n\nAs Russia makes gains, a weary Ukraine weighs expanding the draft\n\nKyiv, Ukraine – The small group of women thought about canceling their protest when the sirens went off. But even though Kyiv was under missile attack again, it went ahead anyway. Antonina brought along her 3-year-old son Sasha.\n\n“My dad doesn’t come home. We are waiting for him. I’m waiting for my dad to come back,” the little boy said.\n\nHolding a sign saying, “Fair Deadlines for Demobilization,” Antonina said her husband was serving in a mortar unit near Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine. She has not seen him for five months and tries to rationalize his absence to Sasha.\n\nMobilization periods are currently open-ended, with no statutory cut-off. Antonina’s husband volunteered two years ago, just after Russia’s full-scale invasion. Now aged 43, he has served long enough, she told CNN.\n\n“It is hard for my husband to endure this length of time on the ground, avoiding all the shells and doing everything he needs to do at the front line,” she said.\n\nA short distance away from where the women were standing, lawmakers debated reforms to Ukraine’s mobilization rules, inside Kyiv’s heavily protected parliament building. A new law could be passed within a few weeks that would pave the way for a significant increase in conscription numbers.\n\nRead more about Ukraine’s plan to expand the draft"
