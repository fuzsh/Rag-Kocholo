        "text": "2 killed and 1 injured after Russian drone hits car in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region\n\nTwo men were killed and one woman was injured after a Russian drone hit a car with civilians in Ukraine’s northeastern region of Kharkiv, a military official said on Telegram Wednesday.\n\nA man with his wife and a driver were on their way home from work at a local farm when the strike took place in the village of Petropavlivka, said Oleh Syniehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional military administration.\n\nThe woman was taken to the hospital after the strike, Syniehubov said.\n\n11 Ukrainian children return home after repatriation from Russia, Ukrainian parliament commissioner says\n\nEleven Ukrainian children reunited with their families after being repatriated from Russia on Tuesday, the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said on X.\n\nOleksandr, 16, told Agence France-Presse (AFP): “Everything will get better. After all, with loved ones, life will be easier from now on.”\n\nThe children were repatriated from Russia through Qatari mediation and with the support of the United Nations Children’s Fund.\n\nRussian troops to keep advancing into key eastern Ukrainian town. Here are the latest headlines\n\nAn Ukrainian commander stationed on the outskirts of Avdiivka said Russia has the capacity to continue its advance into the eastern town and will “continue to do so.”\n\nMaksym Zhorin, deputy commander of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, posted to Telegram on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are “clearly aware that the Russians have enough forces in the town itself to continue their offensive.”\n\nHe said Russian troops were headed in the direction of Lastochkyne.\n\nHere are the latest headlines:\n\nUS to impose sanctions on Russia: The US will announce a major sanctions package against Russia on Friday, a White House official said. It is intended to hold President Vladimir Putin accountable for his two-year war on Ukraine — and for the death of Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny.\n\nNavalny: Navalny’s mother released a video Tuesday appealing to Putin to allow her to see her son. Navalny’s body will not be returned to the family for at least two weeks, according to a his spokesperson. Meanwhile, Navlany’s younger brother, Oleg Navalny, has been added to Russia’s wanted list, according to Russian state media TASS.\n\nPutin awards military honors to high-ranking prison official: Putin awarded Valery Boyarinev, the deputy director of the Russian Prison Service, a special rank of Colonel-General of Internal Service, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Boyarinev’s promotion comes three days after Navalny died and some of Navalny’s allies are drawing a link between the promotion and his death. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied on Tuesday that there is any link between the death of Navalny and this promotion. CNN cannot verify this claim.\n\nNavalny widow asks EU to not recognize Russia’s election: Navalny’s widow has urged the European Union to not recognize next month’s Russian elections. A transcript released Tuesday revealed Yulia Navalnaya’s passionate plea to the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union as she blamed Putin for killing her husband.\n\nRussian attack in Sumy region: Five people, including a mother and her sons, have been killed by a Russian drone attack in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, according to the region’s military administration.\n\nUkraine commits to democracy despite remaining under martial law: Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the nation is staunchly committed to democracy, even as it is unclear if elections will be held this year during the country’s war against Russia. Elections usually occur every five years in Ukraine — with the last held in 2019— but do not take place while the country is under martial law.\n\nUS dual citizen arrested in Russia: The FSB security service arrested a dual US-Russian citizen on charges of treason for collecting funds for Ukrainian organizations and openly supporting Kyiv. FSB said Ksenia Pavlovna Karelina, a 33-year-old Los Angeles resident, was detained in the city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nRussian defector reportedly dead: A Russian helicopter pilot Maxim Kuzminov who defected to Ukraine in a dramatic operation is dead, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) told CNN. The statement comes as Spanish authorities investigate the killing of a man shot dead in Spain a week ago.\n\nFirst group of Ukrainian pilots to complete US F-16 training by summer\n\nThe first four Ukrainian pilots are scheduled to complete training on F-16 fighter jets by summer, according to the Arizona National Guard. The pilots began training in mid-October with the 162nd Fighter Wing in Tucson, Arizona. The Pentagon said the training process would take several months to complete.\n\nA second group of another four pilots began training in January, according to Capt. Erin Hannigan, a spokeswoman for the Arizona National Guard, while a third group of four is currently going through English-language training, which is required to fly the fourth-generation US fighter jet.\n\nAll of the pilots are expected to complete their training between May and August, said Hannigan, though the exact timeline depends on the progress of the program.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky requested F-16 fighters for months, believing the advanced US jets would be able to challenge Russia’s aerial power over the battlefield.\n\nLast summer, a coalition of nations led by Denmark began training Ukrainian pilots on the US jets. The Netherlands, Denmark and Norway have pledged to provide Ukraine with the F-16s jets after the training program. The US also committed to approving the transfer of the jets as soon as training was completed.\n\nEstonian government says officials arrested several people with ties to Russian-directed influence operation\n\nEstonia has detained 10 suspects for “acting on behalf of a Russian special service” in connection to influence operation on its territory, its government announced Tuesday.\n\nThe people arrested by the Estonian Internal Security Service include both Russian and Estonian nationals, officials said. The goal was for the Russian group to “spread fear and create tension in Estonian society,” the Estonian Internal Security Service said in a statement.\n\nInvestigators suspect these people were recruited by the Russian special service to gather information and perform various actions — like vandalizing the cars of the interior minister and several monuments. Some of those arrested were recruited via social media, according to Margo Palloson, director general of the Estonian Internal Security Service.\n\nRussia has not yet responded to these claims.\n\nMore context: With Russia’s war in Ukraine raging in the region, the arrests in Estonia come as the tension between Talinn and Moscow has continued to rise in recent days.\n\nEstonia joined NATO in 2004 and has been a particular target because of its substantial Russian-speaking minority — nearly 25% of the population. The Kremlin is also directly involved in shaping Russian influence operations in neighboring countries, according to Presidential Administration documents leaked last year.\n\nCNN’s Jim Sciutto contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPutin calls Ukraine's withdrawal from Avdiivka an “unconditional success\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Avdiivka “an unconditional success” during his meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in the Kremlin on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Putin said the success in Avdiivka “needs to be developed” and Russian troops have to push further, well prepared “with personnel, weapons, equipment, and ammunition.”\n\nPutin noted that he would talk to Shoigu separately about meeting the needs of the military in this area.\n\nShoigu echoed Putin, agreeing that the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Avdiivka is “a great success for the mixed group of troops, units, formations, everyone without exception.”\n\n“For nine years, day after day, underground passages, concrete structures were made, special lines were made so that one could move without going to the surface,” Shoigu said, adding that Russian air force, army and attack aviation played a major role in capturing Avdiivka as Russia carried out “about 460 aerial strikes” daily before the withdrawal from the city.\n\nShoigu claimed that Ukrainian armed forces leadership was ordered to withdraw from the city when the Ukrainian troops “were already on the move and leaving this settlement” and called it “a chaotic retreat.” Shoigu noted that while retreating, a lot of Ukrainian soldiers were captured as they were wounded in the process and were unable to escape.\n\nThe defense minister also claimed that Krynky, a small riverside village situated on the left bank of Dnipro river in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, is “completely” under Russian control at the moment.\n\nUkraine’s Operational Command “South” denied Russian claims of being in control of Krynky after Shoigu’s announcement and called it “a manipulation and falsification of facts.”\n\n“The defense forces of southern Ukraine continue to hold their positions, inflicting significant losses on the enemy,” the command said.\n\nUS officials were planning for a new sanctions package before Navalny's death, senior official says\n\nUS officials had been working on a new sanctions package for Russia ahead of last week’s death of Alexey Navalny, and are now supplementing them in the wake of the opposition leader’s death, according to a senior US official.\n\nThe package will be timed around the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and officials are coordinating with European partners on the new package, the official said.\n\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday the new measures would be a “substantial package” that covers a wide range of elements linked to the Russian defense industrial base and sources of revenue for the Russian economy that power the country’s “war machine.”\n\nSullivan described the package as “another turn of the crank” after withering western sanctions on Moscow since the start of the Ukraine war. While those sanctions have hampered Russia’s economy, they haven’t deterred President Vladimir Putin from proceeding with the invasion.\n\nExisting sanctions have “isolated” Russia on the world stage, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said aboard Air Force One Tuesday. American assistance has degraded the country’s military, she said.\n\nJean-Pierre said the White House was being careful in detailing the exact parameters of the sanctions to avoid capital flight before the punishments are in place.\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to confer with fellow G7 leaders on a conference call Friday timed around the anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war.\n\nRussia arrests dual US-Russian citizen on charges of treason for collecting funds for Ukraine\n\nRussia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) arrested a dual United States-Russian citizen on charges of treason for collecting funds for Ukrainian organizations and openly supporting Kyiv.\n\nA regional court website from Sverdlovsk, where the case was opened, on Tuesday listed the person’s name as Ksenia Pavlovna Karelina. It said she is being charged under article 275 of the Russian Criminal Code: treason. Karelina said she is appealing her arrest, according to Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti.\n\nThe FSB said earlier Tuesday that a 33-year-old Los Angeles resident was detained in Russia’s city of Yekaterinburg for “providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against the security of our country.”\n\nThe funds raised were used to “purchase tactical medicine, equipment, weapons and ammunition by the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” the FSB said.\n\nThe Sverdlovsk Regional Court press service told RIA her hearing was meant to take place today, but due to the absence of a lawyer, it was postponed until February 29.\n\nCNN has reached out to the US Embassy in Moscow for comment.\n\nThis post has been updated with the US citizen’s name and other information from RIA.\n\nPentagon again urges US House to pass Ukraine aid\n\nDeputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh once again urged the US House of Representatives on Tuesday to pass the national security supplemental legislation and provide security aid to Ukraine.\n\nSingh noted that allies and adversaries of the US are watching. “So we need the House to urgently pass and act — and work to pass this bipartisan supplemental agreement that passed last week in the Senate,” she said.\n\nSingh added that there would only be days after the House returned from recess — in roughly a week — before the funding for military construction will expire, and another week before funding for the entire Department of Defense expires.\n\nAlexey Navalny's widow asks the European Union to not recognize next month's Russian election\n\nAlexey Navalny’s widow has urged the European Union to not recognize next month’s Russian elections.\n\nA transcript released Tuesday revealed Yulia Navalnaya’s passionate plea to the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union as she blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for killing her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Navalnaya’s allegations against Putin were “absolutely unfounded” and “boorish.”\n\nIn her address, Navalnaya also asked the EU and the wider global community to rethink its strategies against Putin.\n\nSome background: The Kremlin leader is running for a fifth term as Russia’s president in next month’s election in which he’s expected to secure a term that will keep him in office until 2030. He is now the longest-serving Russian ruler since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\n\nAlexey Navalny's brother has been added to Russia's wanted list\n\nAlexey Navlany’s younger brother has been added to Russia’s wanted list, according to Russian state media TASS.\n\nOleg Navalny now appears as “wanted” on the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs’ database for alleged unspecified charges under criminal law.\n\nSome context: Alexey Navalny died on Friday in a Russian penal colony in Siberia after being imprisoned upon returning to Russia in February 2021, according to the Russian prison service. The cause of his death is not known. Navalny’s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, has called for the release of his body and vowed to continue her late husband’s work.\n\nWhite House prods House GOP on Ukraine aid: \"Time is of the essence\"\n\nThe White House is again prodding House Republicans to move on Ukraine aid, criticizing lawmakers for taking a two-week recess as assistance languishes for the war-torn country.\n\nIt comes as President Joe Biden has sought to ramp up the pressure on House Republicans.\n\n“The way they’re walking away from the threat of Russia, the way they’re walking away from NATO, the way they’re walking away from meeting our obligations — it’s just shocking. I’ve never seen anything like it,” the president said Monday\n\n5 family members killed in drone attack on northeastern Ukraine, regional authorities say\n\nFive people, including a mother and her sons, have been killed by a Russian drone attack in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, according to the region’s military administration.\n\nThe drone hit a residential building in the city of Konotop on Tuesday morning, killing a mother, her two sons and two of their relatives — including a grandmother — who had traveled from another city, the administration said in a Telegram post.\n\nThe Sumy region has suffered a series of attacks in early February, with one on February 11 killing at least two people, according to an an update from the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine.\n\nIt's lunchtime in Kyiv. Here's what you need to know\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that it shot down two Russian fighter jets in the east of the country, and the armed forces said they held off a series of Russian attacks in the southeast.\n\nMeanwhile, amid growing international concern about Ukraine’s dwindling supplies of weaponry, Sweden said it would provide a record aid package to Kyiv.\n\nAnd, in Russia, a US-Russian dual citizen was arrested by security services on treason charges, according to authorities.\n\nHere are the latest headlines:\n\nUkraine downs 2 Russian jets: The Ukrainian Air Force shot down two Russian fighter jets – an Su-34 and an Su-35S – in the eastern part of the country, it reported Monday.\n\nUkraine repels attacks: Ukraine’s armed forces said they held off Russian attacks toward the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia during a “difficult” night, repelling 11 attacks near Malynivka and Robotyne.\n\nSweden pledges $683 million to Ukraine: Sweden announced its largest support package to Ukraine. “As global military stocks dwindle we will focus more on donations,” Defense Minister Pål Jonson said, outlining Sweden’s commitment to “stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nUS dual citizen arrested in Russia: The FSB security service arrested a dual US-Russian citizen on charges of treason for collecting funds for Ukrainian organizations and openly supporting Kyiv. FSB said the 33-year-old Los Angeles resident was detained in the city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nKremlin hits back at Navalny accusations: The Kremlin dismissed Yulia Navalnaya’s accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin is behind the death of her husband Alexey Navalny. The opposition leader’s mother on Tuesday issued an appeal to Putin to release his body.\n\nUS journalist to remain in Russian jail: The Moscow City Court upheld a decision to keep US journalist Evan Gershkovich in Russian detention until March 30. Gershkovich, a journalist for the Wall Street Journal, was arrested in Russia in March 2023 on spying charges.\n\n\"Let me finally see my son.\" Mother of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny addresses Putin in video\n\nLyudmila Navalnaya, Alexey Navalny’s mother, has released a video appealing directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin to “let me finally see my son.”\n\nNavalnaya filmed the video standing outside the penal colony in Siberia where her son died.\n\n“Behind me is the IK-3 “Polar Wolf” colony, where my son, Alexey Navalny, died on February 16. I haven’t been able to see him for five days. They won’t give me his body. They don’t even tell me where he is,” she says, directly staring at the camera.\n\nSome context: The opposition figure died while serving a sentence in a Russian penal colony. The cause of his death remains unclear, and a Navalny spokesperson said Monday that the body won’t be released to the family for at least 14 days.\n\nMoscow court rejects US journalist Evan Gershkovich's appeal against extending his detention\n\nThe Moscow City Court has upheld a decision to keep US journalist Evan Gershkovich in Russian detention until March 30.\n\nGershkovich, a journalist for the Wall Street Journal, was arrested in Russia in March 2023 on spying charges.\n\nThe FSB, Russia’s main security service, accused him of trying to obtain state secrets – a charge Gershkovich, his employer and the US government have strenuously denied.\n\nThe Moscow City Court said it considered the appeal but would support the decision made earlier by the Lefortovo District Court to extend Gershkovich’s period of detention.\n\nAlready, he has had his pre-trial detention extended twice since his arrest, once in May and again in August.\n\nIf convicted of spying, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nKremlin says Yulia Navalnaya's accusations that Putin killed Navalny are unfounded\n\nThe Kremlin has dismissed Yulia Navalnaya’s accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin is behind the death of her husband Alexey Navalny as “absolutely unfounded” and “boorish.”\n\nNavalny, Russia’s highest-profile opposition leader, died in prison on Friday. Days later, Navalnaya released a video message in which she said “Vladimir Putin killed my husband.”\n\nCNN asked Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to comment on her statement during a call with journalists Tuesday.\n\n“No, we leave this without comment,” he said.\n\nCNN also asked Peskov to comment on Navalnaya’s comments that her husband’s body hasn’t been returned to his family because “they are waiting for the traces of Putin’s next ‘Novichok’ to disappear there.”\n\nPeskov responded: “This is nothing more than unfounded accusations.”\n\n“Because they are not linked to anything, not confirmed by anything. In this case, only for ethical reasons, I cannot assess these words as they should be,” Peskov added.\n\nNavalnaya later responded.\n\nRemember: Novichok is a poison used on Navalny in August 2020. A CNN and Bellingcat investigation later uncovered that a Russian intelligence service squad planted the poison on his underwear.\n\nAsked separately if Putin had seen Navalnaya’s video address, Peskov said he had not.\n\nThe post was updated with Navalnaya’s response."
