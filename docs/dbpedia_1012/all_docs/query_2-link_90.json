Here's how her crackdown contrasts with rising donations from major grocers.\n\nWhy it matters: Harris has promised to clamp down on price gouging at grocery stores as part of her efforts to contain the political liability of inflation, which surged to 4-decade highs during her time in the White House as Joe Biden's Vice President. The proposal has brought accusations that Harris is planning Communist-style price controls from Donald Trump. The Harris campaign claims that many large grocery chains have kept prices high despite stable production costs, leading to their highest profits in 20 years. However, grocery stores typically operate on slim profit margin. Meanwhile, Federal Election Commission data by Reuters reveals that 154 Democratic lawmakers have received donations from top food companies this campaign cycle.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nWalmart Prices Going Down Hands Kamala Harris a Huge Win\n\nWhat happens now? Activists say lawmakers should realize that accepting those donations may come with strings attached, especially when an issue emerges as a campaign talking point.

Here's what else he said.\n\nWhy it matters: Israel launched a wave of airstrikes across southern Lebanon on Sunday, in what it called a preemptive strike on Hezbollah targets. The Israeli military said Hezbollah was planning to launch a barrage of rockets and missiles toward Israel. The Israel Defense Forces said around 100 fighter jets had \"struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels\" at more than 40 sites. Three deaths were confirmed in Lebanon, and one was confirmed in Israel, Reuters reported. The violence was among the biggest exchanges of fire since hostilities erupted between Israel and Hezbollah with the launch of Israel's war against Hamas, an ally of Hezbollah, in Gaza.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nIraq Militia Warns US and Israel over 'Unified' Strike from Iran and Allies\n\nWhat happens now?

Here's more on Vance's stance on abortion and his commitment to Trump's position.\n\nWhy it matters: Abortion is just one issue that has been significant for voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, as many Republican-controlled states have put abortion restrictions into effect with 21 states banning or restricting the medical procedure at every stage of pregnancy. Following months of speculation on Trump's abortion stance amid the 2024 election, he has said that he thinks abortion limits should be left to the states and declined to endorse a federal abortion ban. Meanwhile, Vance's stance on abortion has sparked fierce backlash from Democrats. Here are his previous comments about women and women's issues.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nDonald Trump Releases Four-Sentence Abortion Plan\n\nWhat happens now?

Here's what this could mean for global markets.\n\nWhy it matters: In recent months, particularly following April's meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Politburo, there have been attempts to stabilize the nation's property market after it was thrown in disarray in 2021 when real estate giant Evergrande Group defaulted on interest repayments. But despite the introduction of measures, which included reducing down-payment requirements in some places, getting rid of the floor of mortgage rates and easing purchase restrictions, there's little evidence of success.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nChina Rejects $1 Trillion Plan to End Housing Crisis\n\nWhat happens now?

The study surveyed 2,995 renters and homeowners across the U.S., focusing on 669 respondents who plan to move within the next year. Find out what it reveals.\n\nWhy it matters: The desire for more space is a predominant concern among Gen Zers—41.4 percent of respondents cited this as a reason for moving home—compared to 19.8 percent of Boomers, 32.6 percent of Gen Xers and 33 percent of Millennials. This focus on space over social factors like diversity can be attributed to Gen Z's work habits. Many work remotely or follow hybrid schedules, which require dedicated home offices and advanced technology for fast and reliable Wi-Fi, according to experts.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nGen Z Is More Worried About Housing Costs Than Millennials Are\n\nWhat happens now? Kamala Harris has unveiled a range of initiatives to fix America's housing market should she become president. It is hoped that certain plans such as up to $25,000 in downpayment support for first-time buyers will get Gen Z voters on board. On the other hand, Trump has called this a \"big mistake\" that would lead to a shortage of housing and price hikes.\n\nMap Shows Most Religious Countries in the World\n\nThe concept of religion has played a significant role in shaping the development of many societies.
