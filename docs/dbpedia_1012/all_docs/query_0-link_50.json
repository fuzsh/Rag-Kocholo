The military action, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, amounts to a full-scale invasion, says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nCasualties are mounting on both sides. The repercussions are being felt beyond Europe as rising geopolitical risk and volatile energy and financial markets rock Asia.\n\nFor all our coverage, visit our Ukraine crisis page.\n\nRead our in-depth coverage:\n\n-- China says Moscow relations solid, accuses U.S. of building 'Pacific NATO'\n\n-- Russia offers Middle East fighters '$400 a week' to join Ukraine war\n\n-- U.S. lawmaker urges India to speak out against Ukraine invasion\n\n-- Turkish drone success in Ukraine sets stage for Asia roadshow\n\n-- Russia sanctions put spotlight on crypto: 5 things to know\n\nEntries include material from wire services and other sources.\n\nNote: Nikkei Asia on March 5 decided to temporarily suspend its reporting from Russia until further information becomes available regarding the scope of the revised criminal code.\n\nThis blog file is now closed.

Yum has at least 1,000 KFC and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia, nearly all of them independent franchisees.\n\n7:57 a.m. Credit rating agency Fitch downgrades Russia's sovereign rating by six notches further into junk territory to C from B, saying a default is imminent as sanctions and trade restrictions undermine its willingness to service debt. \"Further ratcheting up of sanctions and proposals that could limit trade in energy increase probability of a policy response by Russia that includes at least selective non-payment of its sovereign debt obligations,\" the rating agency said in a statement.\n\n7:40 a.m. Universal Music Group says it is suspending all operations in Russia and closing offices, as it joins a growing number of companies protesting the violence in Ukraine.

The move follows a plea Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for fighter aircraft.\n\nWarsaw is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as Poland is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine -- which is not a NATO ally -- and Russia.\n\n4:30 a.m. The International Atomic Energy Agency's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, says that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine have been lost.\n\nThe systems refer to the field of IAEA work aimed at keeping track of nuclear material.

Russia's military entered the Chernobyl site following the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n3:15 a.m. The BBC says it has decided to resume English-language reporting in Russia, which it had suspended last week in light of a new law that makes it illegal to report news that could discredit the Russian armed forces.\n\nThe move to restart reporting comes after \"careful deliberation,\" the British broadcaster says. It contrasts with The New York Times' decision to pull its reporters from Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, McDonald's says it will temporarily close its restaurants in Russia.

Read more.\n\nTuesday, March 8\n\n9:00 p.m. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in his latest tweet is asking global businesses to stop supporting Russia financially. \"Ukraine requests the ethically and socially responsible global businesses to stop or suspend operations with or in Russia, therefore refusing to finance its violence, murders, and crimes against humanity,\" Kuleba says in the twitter account of the ministry where he attached his full appeal to the global business community.\n\n8:47 p.m. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin have spoken on the phone and expressed \"hope for the next round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv soon and an agreement on the key issues lying in the center of the Ukrainian crisis in order to settle it and cease hostilities,\" Interfax reports, citing the Russian foreign ministry.

The fuel supplier, which operates in Australia under the Shell brand, says it is \"appalled\" by the events in Ukraine as Russia continues its incursion. A spokesperson for Ampol, Australia's only other refiner, says the company has not bought Russian crude oil or products since the conflict started.\n\n11:41 a.m. Fitch becomes the second major credit rating agency, following Moody's, to suspend its commercial operations in Russia with immediate effect on Monday, saying its analysts outside the country will provide its coverage instead.
