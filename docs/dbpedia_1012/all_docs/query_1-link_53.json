        "text": "Storage Wars: Northern Treasures\n\nWho Wants To Be A Bazillionaire\n\nUrsula’s new employee Tania is tough, goth, and not afraid to pick a fight at an auction in Toronto. Of course, Cindy isn’t about to back down. When Bogart decides to assert himself, he threatens Roy’s claim to the title of biggest jerk at the auction.\n\nStorage Wars: Northern Treasures\n\nCause That's What Janitors Do!\n\nPart-time janitors Mike and Armando hope to clean up at an auction in Emery Village. Rick and Cindy don’t want to deal with yet another pair of newbies. Paul on the other hand, is always on the lookout for potential replacements for Bogart. Roy can’t handle the tooth, but Ursula’s gnarly locker is like totally tubular.\n\nHardcore Pawn\n\nAll In The Family\n\nAshley and Seth have officially marked their territories. Tensions between the two run high, but when a customer demands drug money they are forced to band together for the good of the store. Then, a signed and authenticated Elvis record may command major cash, but will Les and Rich spend too much? And later, the gloves come off when a customer threatens to attack Les after hours.\n\nHardcore Pawn\n\nAshley Vs. Rich\n\nWhen Rich invades Ashley's territory in the jewelry and loan department, she puts him in his place. Then, Seth negotiates hard for high-value jewels, but when the customer starts abusing his girlfriend, things really heat up. Plus, Les eyes a rare piece of memorabilia from the original Aliens movie and ignites a bidding war on the sales floor. And later, Rich crosses the line and sends Ashley through the roof. With neither of them willing to back down, will Ashley find common ground or send Rich packing?\n\nCash Cowboys\n\nA Maritime Bet\n\nWhile in Nova Scotia, the guys turn up the heat with a bet: Who will find the ultimate East Coast prize? In Great Village, they get priority access to an off-limits warehouse. While scouring a treasure-filled Halifax home, Scott falls in love with an erotiphone. And, the picking at Garth’s personal museum is red-hot, and Sheldon uncovers a nautical memento that may just win him the bet!"
