        "text": "Dual US-Russian citizen detained in Russia for donating $51.80 to Ukrainian charity, US employer says\n\nDual US-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina, a 33-year-old Los Angeles resident, is being detained in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg because she donated money to a Ukrainian charity while she was in the United States, according to her employer.\n\nRussia accused Karelina of “providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against the security of our country.”\n\nKarelina entered Russia on January 2, and the United States learned on February 8 that she had been arrested, a US official told CNN. Consular access still has not been granted, according to the official.\n\nBefore her arrest, she worked as an esthetician at Ciel Spa at SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills, according to the spa. She was visiting family members, including her 90-year-old grandmother, at the time of her arrest, the spa said.\n\nKarelina is being wrongly “accused of treason for allegedly donating $51.80 to a Ukrainian charity in the US,” according to her employer’s statement.\n\nWhat social media tells us about her: Karelina posted often about her life on the Russian social media platform VK. In November 2021, she posted photos standing between American flags holding a piece of paper and an American flag. In the post, she said she received her US citizenship. The US official confirmed that she became a US citizen in 2021 and said the United States government is tracking her detention.\n\nIn another post on July 2017, Karelina posted many pictures appearing to be of her wearing a ballerina costume, including pointe shoes, a leotard, and a tutu in New York City.\n\nRussia's army chief awards medals to soldiers who took part in Avdiivka assault, ministry says\n\nRussia’s army chief has visited troops near the frontline in Eastern Ukraine and presented awards to soldiers who participated in the assault on the town of Avdiivka, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Wednesday.\n\nMost of the footage was recorded indoors and CNN could not independently verify where it was taken.\n\nAccording to the ministry, Army General Valery Gerasimov visited the command post for the troops that participated in the attack on the town.\n\nRussia’s military chief added the “major task” of conquering Avdiivka had been accomplished in what he said was a “fairly short period of time.”\n\nSome context: Russia raised its flag in several parts of Avdiivka in Donetsk on Sunday, hours after Ukrainian forces beat a hasty retreat from a town they’ve been defending for a decade.\n\n3 people killed and more than a dozen wounded in Russian shelling, Ukrainian authorities say\n\nThree people were killed and at least 18 wounded by Russian shelling in several Ukrainian regions over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian authorities said Wednesday.\n\nOleh Sniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said two people had been killed and at least one wounded after about 20 areas in the region came under Russian artillery and mortar fire.\n\n“An enemy kamikaze drone hit a civilian car in Petropavlivka village” in the Kupiansk district at around 5 p.m. Tuesday, Sniehubov said, killing two men who were farm workers.\n\nIn the Donetsk region, one person was killed in the town of Kostyantynivka, according to the head of the region’s military administration Vadym Filashkin.\n\nSix people were wounded in the city of Kramatorsk as a result of Russian missiles, and 12 high-rise buildings were damaged, Filashkin said.\n\nIn the Kherson region, four people were wounded, said regional military head Oleksandr Prokudin.\n\nRussian forces fired 27 shells at the city of Kherson, he said.\n\nIn the Dnipropetrovsk region, three people were wounded in the city of Nikopol, said regional military chief Serhiy Lysak.\n\n11 Ukrainian children return home after repatriation from Russia\n\nEleven Ukrainian children reunited with their families after being repatriated from Russia on Tuesday, the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said.\n\nOleksandr, 16, told AFP news agency: “Everything will get better. After all, with loved ones, life will be easier from now on.”\n\nThe children were repatriated from Russia through Qatari mediation and with the support of the United Nations Children’s Fund.\n\nSome context: Ukraine has long said that thousands of Ukrainian children have been forcibly sent to Russian-controlled areas since Moscow’s invasion.\n\nIn March last year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nThe Russian government doesn’t deny taking Ukrainian children and has made their adoption by Russian families a centerpiece of propaganda."
