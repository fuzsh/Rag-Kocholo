        "text": "This Russian Revolution timeline lists significant events and developments in Russia in 1917. This timeline has been written and compiled by Alpha History authors. Note: Russia used the Julian or Old Style calendar until January 24th 1918, when this system was replaced by the Gregorian or New Style calendar. Dates in this calendar are Julian or Old Style before January 24th 1918 and Gregorian or New Style thereafter. To convert Old Style dates to New Style dates, add 13 days (for example, October 26th 1917 O.S. becomes November 8th N.S.)\n\n1917\n\nJanuary 9th: More than 140,000 Russian workers strike in commemoration of the 12th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\nThe February Revolution\n\nFebruary 14th: More than 100,000 workers are still on strike; the Duma attacks the government failing to respond to food shortages.\n\nFebruary 19th: The February Revolution begins.
