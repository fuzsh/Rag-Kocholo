Final Adjusted numbers will be posted each night around 9pm-10pm UK apart from the weekend.\n\nNote: During the UK/USA Clock Changes, the above times will change by 1 hour.\n\nNumbers are often delayed by Nielsen.\n\nRatings Provided by Nielsen.\n\nRemember: ALL SPOILERS must be put inside the spoiler tags. If you post spoilers without tags your comments will be deleted. Repeat offences will result in you being banned. Please stay on Topic.
