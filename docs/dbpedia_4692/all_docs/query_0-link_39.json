Each SONIC franchisee is an independent employer and thus solely responsible for hiring decisions and all other employment-related matters for the franchisee’s restaurant(s). The terms “Company,” “SONIC,” “SONIC Drive-In,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to the specific entity (corporate or franchise) that owns and operates the SONIC Drive-In restaurant to which you are applying. Nothing on this site should be construed as Sonic Franchising LLC or its affiliates being involved in or having control over a franchise employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Neither Sonic Franchising LLC nor its affiliates have access to franchisees’ employment records. Any employment-related questions regarding a franchise restaurant should be directed to the franchisee.\n\nSONIC and its franchisees are equal opportunity employers."
