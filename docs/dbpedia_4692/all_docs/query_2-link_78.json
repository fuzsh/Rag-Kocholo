        "text": "When thinking about running, one of the first things we need to consider is our running shoe. There are several excellent brands out there, but not all will be the perfect fit for you. One of the leading running shoe brands is Newton. The name was derived from Sir Isaac Newton and his 3rd lawÂ of motion which states that âFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.â The Newton brand lives by this motto, making sure that they are able to create shoes that deliver.\n\nThe Newton brand has been around since the mid-2000s, focusing on running shoes that helped correct a runnerâs stride. Last night, I got to put on my first ever pair of Newton Running Shoes. The first thing I immediately noticed were the lugs underneath. To me, having these lugs under my shoe almost felt like there was a rectangular block that was somehow elevating me, hence forcing me to land on my forefoot. It felt weird at first, but once I got used to it, I felt a tad bit more power in my run. by forcing me to land on my forefoot, I was inclined forward and somehow even ended up running with a better form.\n\nNewton Running Technology:\n\nâWe set out to create a running shoe that was different. Not for the sake of being different, but to make every stride better. Our active technology creates the most responsive ride on two running shoes. Our architecture creates full-foot protection. Our level platform aligns with the human body and puts you in a position to run most naturally. Plus, you canât miss the bright and cool colors â even at high speeds.â\n\nThe New Newton V\n\nThe original model from Newton Running, the Distance is the shoe that started the revolution. Like its predecessors, the Distance V is lightning fast and wickedly light for runners who want a dynamically propulsive speed trainer and racer.\n\nEnhancements include:\n\nNEW seamless upper mesh for higher ventilation and better conformity to the foot\n\nNEW ice rubber lugs\n\nNEW full flex zone accommodates splay of the foot at the propulsion stage of the gait\n\nTighter-tuned trampoline lug membrane than the Gravity or Motion for greater responsiveness and power.\n\n5-lug platform offers a more stable platform\n\nSuede tongue and lightly padded collar\n\nAnatomical metatarsal stretch panels\n\nLca-up closure with semi-flat laces\n\n360 degree reflectivity\n\nNeutral\n\nWeight: 6.2 oz (W), 7.02 z (M)\n\nDrop 2.0mm\n\nUpper\n\nLightweight, breathable mesh\n\nNew seamless upper for higher ventilation and better conformity\n\nNew full flex zone accommodates splay of foot\n\nHeel lace lock\n\nSemi-flat lightweight laces\n\n360 degree reflectivity\n\nOutersole\n\nHigh-rebound EVA\n\ns.h.a.r.c outsole (Super high abrasion rubber compound)\n\nMidsole\n\nAction/ReactionTM Technology in the midfoot\n\nBiomechanical metatarsal sensor plate\n\nEnhance medial midsole platform\n\nHigh-rebound EVA\n\ns.h.a.r.c in forefoot\n\nHigh abrasion rubber outsole wedge on lateral heel\n\nNew ice rubber lugs\n\n–\n\nFor more information, visit the following sites:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewtonRunningPH/?fref=ts\n\nIG: @NewtonRunningPh\n\n#TestTheFeel #NewtonRunning\n\nFor updates on other events,\n\nFollow http://www.facebook.com/littlerunningteacherpage\n\nTwitter @cherylgolangco\n\nIG: @cherylgolangco"
