        "text": "I think it's a great question, and enjoyed it very much when I grappled with it myself.\n\nHere's a picture of some of the forces in this scenario.$^\\dagger$ The ones that are the same colour as each other are pairs of equal magnitude, opposite direction forces from Newton's third law. (W and R are of equal magnitude in opposite directions, but they're acting on the same object - that's Newton's first law in action.)\n\nWhile $F_\\text{matchbox}$ does press back on my finger with an equal magnitude to $F_\\text{finger}$, it's no match for $F_\\text{muscles}$ (even though I've not been to the gym in years).\n\nAt the matchbox, the forward force from my finger overcomes the friction force from the table. Each object has an imbalance of forces giving rise to acceleration leftwards.\n\nThe point of the diagram is to make clear that the third law makes matched pairs of forces that act on different objects. Equilibrium from Newton's first or second law is about the resultant force at a single object.\n\n$\\dagger$ (Sorry that the finger doesn't actually touch the matchbox in the diagram. If it had, I wouldn't have had space for the important safety notice on the matches. I wouldn't want any children to be harmed because of a misplaced force arrow. Come to think of it, the dagger on this footnote looks a bit sharp.)\n\nIf I could only change one thing about physics education, it would be the phrasing of Newton's 3rd law. According to my copy of Magnificent Principia (by Colin Pask, Prometheus Books, 2013) the \"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction...\" phrasing is Newton's. And it's been causing confusion ever since.\n\nTo get a sense of what Newton really meant, consider the universal gravitation equation: $$F=G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$\n\nNotice there are two masses specified, but there is no \"source\" mass and no \"target\" mass. And there is only one force produced by this equation. Now, you can look at it as two different forces: $m_1$ attracting $m_2$ and $m_2$ attracting $m_1$. But that is misleading. It gives the impression that the forces somehow have independent existences. But they don't. They are completely, inextricably linked. So much so, that I think it makes much more sense to this of this as one attractive force between two masses.\n\nCoulombs law follows the same format:\n\n$$F=k_c\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$\n\nAgain, you can think of this as two different forces. But I think the equation really hints at a single attractive force (different charge signs) or a single repulsive force (identical charge signs) between two charges.\n\nThat is what Newton meant by his third law. It's not possible for $m_1$ to attract $m_2$ without $m_1$ being caught up in the very same force of attraction between the two particles. And it's not possible for $q_1$ to attract or repel $q_2$ without $q_1$ being caught up in the very same force.\n\nNewton's third law is traditionally taught as pairs of forces. I think it makes more sense to present it is as a single force that must always operate between pairs of bodies, as implied by Coulomb's law and the Universal Gravitation equation.\n\nThis is harder to see with contact forces. Part of the problem is that human muscles must constantly expend energy at a molecular level in order to stay contracted. So it's easy to confuse force exertion with expenditure of energy. And humans have cognition and agency. So to say, \"The person pushes on the matchbox and the matchbox pushes on the person\" feels wrong because the person is expending energy; the matchbox is not. The person has agency and initiates the push; the matchbox is inanimate.\n\nTo get a better feel for Newton's third law, consider yourself in a deep swimming pool where your feet are off the bottom. You're next to the wall. Now push on the wall. What happens? You push yourself away from the wall. The traditional explanation is that you push on the wall, and \"the wall pushes back on you.\" And while that is technically true, it doesn't make intuitive sense because you know darn well that you're the one doing the pushing.\n\nWhat's really happening is that you create a repulsive force between the wall and yourself. The wall is fixed to the earth and the earth is mighty big and hard to move. So the repulsive force manifests itself in you pushing yourself away from the wall.\n\nWhen you \"push the matchbox,\" you're really setting up a repulsive force between your finger and the matchbox. (At a molecular level, this is just the Coulomb repulsion, of course.) But you're much more massive than the matchbox. Your weight and the friction between your shoes and the floor essentially fix you to the floor and make you immovable. So the repulsive force manifests itself as the matchbox moving.\n\nSo many physics problems are expressed as \"A attracts B\" or \"A repels B.\" That wording is misleading at best. What really happens is that \"A and B attract each other\" or \"A and B repel each other.\" Always. That is Newton's 3rd law.\n\nFinally, when dealing with forces where one mass (or one charge) is fixed in some way, or so much larger than the other (such as an apple falling towards the earth), it's very common to ignore that fact that the masses are attracting each other, and to phrase the interaction as if it were just the earth attracting the apple and nothing more. That is an oversimplification. But it's justified by the fact that the attractive force between the two masses is overwhelmingly manifested in the motion of the apple.\n\nIn fact, Newton phrased that part well in The Principia,\n\n\"The changes made by these actions are equal . . . if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments . . . the changes of velocities made towards common parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies [the masses].\"\n\nGiven Newton's third law, why is there motion at all? Should not all forces even themselves out, so nothing moves at all?\n\nThird Newton law has nothing to do with stopping motion at all. Consider a pair of astronauts in space, pushing each other with forces $\\vec F_{1,2}=-\\vec F_{2,1}$, at time $t_0$ :\n\nLater they are propelled into the opposite directions from each other. So there are situations where actually third Newton law helps to move, all other conditions being equal.\n\nWhen I push a table using my finger, the table applies the same force onto my finger like my finger does on the table just with an opposing direction, nothing happens except that I feel the opposing force.\n\nIt does happen. Simply changes due to interacting Van Der Waals forces are so small, that you are not able to notice it. But consider a cup weight interacting with a plastic ruler which has a lot smaller bulk modulus than your table surface :\n\nAs you see ruler is bent, even cup weight and ruler normal forces are at equilibrium. Similarly, if you will push table too hard - you may break your finger. It will be deformed by table normal force. Actually if you will look closer at your finger, you'll see that finger touching skin and other soft tissues are already deformed a bit.\n\nBut why can I push a box on a table by applying force (F=ma) on one side, obviously outbalancing the force the box has on my finger and at the same time outbalancing the friction the box has on the table?\n\nBox is affected by your finger pushing force and static friction force, which operates in opposing direction. So by definition friction force and finger pushing force are not in Newton third law force pair, because they targets same body - box. Force pair in a third Newton law operates on a different bodies, which is not the case here, so your example irrelevant.\n\nWhen you push an object, it is true the the object pushes you back with the same force. However, this does not mean that the force that you are exerting on the body has got cancelled. The object will continue to to experience the push and so would you from the object being pushed. In a way they are 2 separate forces, each acting on separate object.\n\nTo understand the concept better imagine yourself pushing your friend and your friend pushing you back with the same force. Just because the forces are equal and opposite in magnitude, does not mean that you feel at ease. You feel the pain in your muscles because there is a force acting on your arms that stresses your muscles.\n\nScientifically put, you need to see the body being pushed in isolation. The force you are putting on the body is “tangible” and makes it move once the force of friction has been overcome.\n\nThis is the reason problems around Newton’s laws of motion are solved by using “free body diagrams”. This essentially requires you to label all forces that act on a body and then find the “Net force”, using vector algebra. This net force is then equated with the product of mass and the acceleration this net force is creating, to find the unknown in the equation. This also Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion that is used to answer problems like this (Net Force = ma)\n\nI have created these 2 video that will bring more clarity to you-\n\nNewton's 2nd law of motion\n\nNewton's 3rd law of motion\n\nI have added a few additional forces to the diagram produced by AndrewC to show 5 groups of forces which are Newton's third law pairs and made the hand massless to simplify the diagram.\n\nThe Newton's third law pairs are colour coded and labelled.\n\nThese pairs of forces:\n\nare equal in magnitude and opposite in direction\n\nact on different objects\n\nare of the same type ie both contact, both gravitational etc.\n\nFor example $R_{\\rm be}$ is the reaction on the box due to the earth and its Newton's third law pair is $R_{\\rm eb}$ the reaction on the earth due to the box, $W_{\\rm be}$ is the gravitational attraction on the box due to the earth and $W_{\\rm eb}$ is the gravitational attraction on the earth due to the box.\n\nThe $F$ forces are the frictional forces between the box and the earth, the $X$ forces are the contact forces between the box and the hand, and the $Y$ forces are the forces on the hand and the person and the earth as a result of the action of muscles in the arm.\n\nIf the system is assumed to be the box, the hand and the person & the earth then the net external force on that system is zero and the centre of mass of the system does not undergo an acceleration.\n\nLooking at vertical, y-direction, forces acting on the box alone system and applying Newton's second law gives $R_{\\rm be} - W_{\\rm be} = 0$ and the equivalent equation for vertical forces acting on the person & earth system is $R_{\\rm eb} - W_{\\rm eb} = 0$ so the box and the earth do not accelerate in the vertical, y-direction.\n\nNow consider the forces acting on the box in the x-direction and apply Newton's second law $F_{\\rm be} - X_{\\rm bh} = m_{\\rm b}a_{\\rm b}$ where $m_{\\rm b}$ is the mass of the box and $a_{\\rm b}$ is its acceleration.\n\nNow if the left hand side of this equation is zero the box could be at rest or moving at constant velocity.\n\nIf the left hand side of the equation is no zero then the box will accelerate and if the force on the box due to the hand has a larger magnitude than the frictional force on the box due to the earth then the box will accelerate to the left.\n\nSo even though you have all these Newton's third law pairs supposedly cancelling each other out they do not because the act on different bodies.\n\nFor the hand system the equation of motion is $X_{\\rm hb} - Y_{\\rm he}=0$ which means that the magnitude of the force on the box due to the hand $X_{\\rm bh}$ is equal to the magnitude of the force on the person & earth due to the hand $Y_{\\rm eh}$.\n\nAnd of course even though you would notice the effect because the earth is so massive, the person and earth system of mass $m_{\\rm e}$ would suffer an acceleration $a_{\\rm e}$ in a direction opposite to that of the box given by the equation $Y_{\\rm eh} - F_{\\rm eb} = m_{\\rm e}a_{\\rm e}$.\n\nNote that the magnitude of the force the person & earth system is exactly the equal to the magnitude of the force on the box system."
