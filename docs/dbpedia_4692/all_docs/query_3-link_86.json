        "text": "Newton Women's Distance III - Neutral Light Weight Trainer\n\nEveryday running shoes with a unique cushioning system that preserves energy.\n\nThe Product:\n\nThe Newton Men's Distance III is a great choice for those seeking a regular training and racing shoe. The P.O.P 1 platform with added stability offers lightweight performance for efficient running during distance racing and weekly speed workouts.\n\nRunners who have a more midfoot and forefoot focus will benefit the most from the particular design of the Distance II shoe.\n\nThe shoe's upper is seamless, breathable and fast-drying due to its open air mesh design. This aids ventilation and prevents irritation caused by the build up of moisture in the shoe.\n\nThe shoes feature Newton's Action/Reaction technology in the midsole, a cushioning system that responds to your running style by creating a trampoline-like effect. This works by providing quicker bounce-back to avoid the loss of vital energy.\n\nThe upper features a heel lace lock and semi-flat lightweight laces. The shoes are also reflective from all angles to help you stay safe in darker conditions.\n\nKey Features:"
