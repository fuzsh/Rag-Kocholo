        "text": "Newton has many forefoot strike running shoes that are becoming increasingly popular in the minimalist running community. For example, the Newton Neutral Racer Shoe is a huge hit among many forefoot runners because the shoe apparently aids in maintaining a forefoot strike landing during running. Interestingly, the same shoe was scientifically proven to improve running economy by positively effecting running form.\n\nReview of Newton’s Forefoot Strike Running Shoes\n\nHow does a Newton running shoe enforce a forefoot strike landing during running?\n\nNewton Running claims that the actuator lugs integrated into the forefoot design of their Neutral Racer shoe lowers peak impact, increases energy return, and thus may be essential to running economy.\n\nMoreover, the Newton Running Company designs their running shoes to facilitate a forefoot strike landing pattern instead of a heel strike landing pattern. Scientists Moran and Geer put Newton and their actuator lugs to the to the test and found the following:\n\nparticipants running in the Newton Neutral Racers with the actuator lugs performed better than participants in Neutral Racers without the actuator lugs (shown below).\n\nthe actuator lugs improved running economy and reduced perception of effort\n\nthe Newton Neutral Racers with actuator lugs exceeded a 2% improvement in running economy compared to the Newton Neutral Racers without actuator lugs\n\nWhy Actuator Lugs Produced Better Results\n\nThe forefoot actuator lugs added hardness to the sole. Previous studies have found that harder soles increase knee flexion and leg compliance compared to running shoes with a softer sole.\n\nFor instance, a study by Clark et al, found that hard soles absorbed less impact at foot strike causing an increase in maximum knee flexion (bending of the knee).\n\nOther studies have found that barefoot runners landed with greater knee flexion, especially on harder surfaces, compared to runners in cushioned footwear and were found to use less oxygen to fuel their muscles.\n\nincreased knee flexion provides a cushioning effect, making foot strike landing softer and comfortable, and is correlated with reduced muscular efforts and reduced oxygen consumption\n\nTherefore, the researchers suggested that the forefoot actuator lugs may have influenced lower leg kinematics which subsequently resulted in lower oxygen consumption.\n\nPerhaps, sole hardness due to the actuator lugs resulted in perceptual conditions of impact similar to that of barefoot running. That is, perception of impact from the interaction between the actuator lugs and the ground, may be perceived in the same way then if the runner was running barefoot on a hard surface.\n\nLooking to give the Newton Racer shoe a try?\n\nMore From Run Forefoot:\n\nWhat is the Best Running Technique?\n\nChoosing Running Shoes for Forefoot Running\n\nWhy You Have Running Pain in Top of Foot\n\nOveruse Injuries Related to Heel Strike Running\n\nReferences:\n\nClarke, T.E., Frederick, E.C., and Cooper, L.B., 1983.
