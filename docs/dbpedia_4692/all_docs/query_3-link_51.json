        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe world marathon records in the 1960s were broken on minimalistic footwear. When the running boom hit the world in the 1970s, running shoe designs were developed to provide shock absorption through the heel. However during fast running humans tend to land on their forefoot. In order to absorb the high gravitational forces during the first part of the stance phase in running, the ankles eccentrically plantar flex over a greater distance than when the landing is on the heel. A basic application of the second law of Newton shows that a touch down with the ball of the foot reduces the stress on the body, as compared to a heel strike. A range of descriptive and experimental studies(4, 5, 6, 7) have indeed shown that landing on the ball of the foot (metatarsal heads) is preferential in terms of impact forces and running speed. Fast athletes run with their foot striking on the ball of the foot (metatarsal heads). Such athletes particularly use the calf musculature as vertical force decelerator and providers of energy return; the muscles absorb the body weight with eccentric contractions plus passive elasticity and push the body back up and away every step of the way.\n\nEver since the running boom in the 1970â€™s scientists and shoe brand manufacturers studied the science of distance running in order to develop tools to prevent injuries and aid performance. The limiting factor for marathon running times is fatigue and soreness in the leg muscles which provide this spring like action. To meet the need of protection from the hard road, the sole needs to have a certain amount of shock absorption to complement the natural shock attenuating function of the leg extensor muscles of the runner. The shoe sole also needs to be light weight to ensure the minimum resistance to the running action. Attempts to provide footwear with minimal weight and optimal shock absorption concentrated on the rear part of the shoe sole for 28 years despite the fact that, increasingly, elite marathon runners made little use of the heel of the shoe. This heel focus in the development of footwear might well explain the low rate of 5.6 seconds per year improvement of the world marathon record in the period of 1970-1998. In the beginning of the 21st Century various footwear designs have been developed to reduce the impact of such forefoot strike on tarmac roads or hard synthetic running tracks. Theoretically such footwear can delay the point at which the marathon runner has to slow down due to the fatigue in the muscles. Sound biomechanical evidence has been provided with regards to the effectiveness of cushioning provided by the shoe sole through in vivo laboratory studies on runners, in vitro testing of shoe soles and related mathematical modelling(8).\n\nRecent laboratory studies on running efficiency comparing shod running with barefoot running have resulted in contradictory findings with regard to footwear and running economy(9, 10, 11)."
