        "text": "I am all sorts of stoked on this shoe. The Newton Energy NR is a fantastic shoe and I might go as far as to say it’s one of Newton’s best shoes yet. There are a number of reasons for this. The 5 lug system, the stable forefoot platform, the soft EVA cushioning, the midfoot rubber plate, the transition, the comfy upper, and the overall long-distance comfort of this shoe make it awesome. If you are a new forefoot runner or an old Newton-ite, this shoe will make you smile.\n\nThe only downsides I’ve really found are the heal-cup fit, the weight, and the odor retention. Other than those points, the shoe has performed amazingly well for me in all sorts of conditions. I’ve put all sorts of mileage on this shoe, probably a good 120 miles at this point, and they are still rockin’ strong and are very comfortable.\n\nAs a shoe reviewer, I’m bouncing between all sorts of shoes all the time. When I would switch back to the 2013 distance, I would have noticeable fatigue in not only my forefeet, but also calves. The lug system definitely takes getting used to, but this made me realize it also needs consistency. But what’s great about the Energy NR is that they are fantastic in my rotation. I can go from a minimal flat, to a trail shoe, and run 20+ miles in the Energy NR without the typical calf strain I get from jumping back into the Distance. Way to go, Newton. You have a winner here.\n\nLIKED:\n\n5 Lug System\n\nMidfoot Plate\n\nSoft EVA\n\nAction/Reaction (The website says v.1, but I now know it’s v.2 WITHOUT membrane)\n\nFits like a Newton\n\nRemovable Insert\n\nDISLIKED:\n\nStinky\n\nHeel Cup\n\nHeavy\n\nQUALITY: 4/5\n\nCOMFORT: 4/5\n\nPRICE: 4/5\n\nLOOKS: 4/5\n\nTOTAL: 16/20\n\nWatch the video above for my full review.
