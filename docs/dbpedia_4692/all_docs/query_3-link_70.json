        "text": "Newton unveils its running shoes for 2013! Newton Running shoes feature proprietary forefoot lugs, lightweight materials, and glove-like fit to promote a natural running gait.\n\nI dropped by the Newton event yesterday to check out the bright and bright new colors of these fast shoes.\n\n– Perfect colors for summer –\n\nWHAT’S THE NEWTON FOR YOU? HERE’S A GUIDE:\n\nMotion (SRP P8,495.00)\n\nLooking for stability? Then the Newton Motion is for you. This Stability Performance Trainer is for runners who need a training shoe that can also work for faster sessions and even for racing. Medial posting offsets pronation to complement the Action/ReactionTM technology in the forefoot. It utilizes highly breathable, fast drying open air mesh, minimal overlays, and metatarsal stretch panels for a light and comfortable fit. The carbon rubber heel and high density rubber outersole will last the distance runner many quality miles, yet a pair only weighs a scant 9.3 ounces. The heel-to-toe drop is 3mm.\n\n– Men’s Newton Motion –\n\n– Women’s Newton Motion –\n\nGravity (SRP P8,495.00)\n\nDesigned for neutral runners, the Newton Gravity can be used as a daily training shoe for faster-paced tempo runs, interval sessions, and as race shoe. The Gravity features Action/ReactionTM technology in the midfoot and heel, a biomechanical metatarsal sensor plate, and enhanced midfoot flexibility. The open air mesh upper is extremely breathable and quick drying. A high density outersole and carbon heel promote excellent durability for even the highest mileage runners. The Newton Gravity weighs 9.1 ounces and has a heel-to-toe drop of 3mm.\n\n– Men’s Newton Gravity –\n\n– Women’s Newton Gravity –\n\nDistance S (SRP P7,995.00)\n\nNeed the lightest running shoe you can get without resorting to a racing flat? Check out the Newton Distance S. Designed for fast-paced running, this lightweight performance stability trainer is a great choice for runners who need a shoe for short- or mid-distance racing and weekly speed sessions. It features Action/ReactionTM technology, dual-density medial posting, a lightweight, quick drying mesh upper, biomechanical metatarsal sensor plate, high-rebound EVA in the midsole, and a lightweight EVA heel. The Newton Distance S weighs 7.8 ounces and has a heel-to-toe drop of 2mm.\n\n– Men’s Newton Distance S –\n\n– Women’s Newton Distance S –\n\nDistance (SRP P7,995.00)\n\nDesigned for more efficient runners, the Newton Distance is a lightweight neutral performance trainer ideal for interval sessions, tempo sessions, and even for racing. Featuring a highly breathable, quick drying open air mesh, minimal anatomical support strapping, Action/ReactionTM technology in the midfoot, biomechanical metatarsal sensor plate, and Met-flex enhanced midfoot flexibility. The Newton Distance weighs 7.8 ounces and has a heel-to-toe drop of 2mm.\n\n– Men’s Newton Distance –\n\n– Women’s Newton Distance –\n\nDuring the event, we were introduced to current and new Newton ambassadors, too. I’m sure we’ll see these fast, competitive runners and triathletes in their Newtons on the roads or in races soon!\n\n– Newton ambassadors: Don Velasco, Mark and Doray Ellis, Toby Claudio, Keshia Fule, Andy Leuterio, and Jay Valencia flanked by Runnr Executives and Newton’s exclusive distributors –\n\nNewton Running shoes are exclusively available at all RUNNR outlets: RUNNR Bonifacio High Street, RUNNR Alabang Town Center, RUNNR Trinoma, RUNNR Cebu, Toby’s Shangri-La Mall, Toby’s Mall of Asia, Toby’s Glorietta, and Toby’s CDO Limketkai Mall. For details, visit www.newtonrunning.com, www.runnr.com.ph , or http://twitter.com/RUNNRstore and http://www.facebook.com/Runnrstore.\n\nHubby and I arrived in rainy Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of this morning. We did so much today, I feel like we’ve been here for a week.\n\nWe checked into Citrus Hotel at 2 a.m. where Renze of Newton and CW-X and our best bet for a half marathon podium finish, Cebuana runner Mary Grace, were already booked the day before. Citrus Hotel is a low-cost hotel with an old bathroom and a spider as special guest, hotel service that was reluctant to provide more than one extra pillow, and a carpeted room that just made me itch wondering if it was clean at all. I woke up at 8 a.m. on my hard mattress to receive good news: Renze was moving us to a better hotel. Thank. You. Lord!\n\n– The only thing good about Citrus Hotel was 1) free wifi and 2) a good view of Kuala Lumpur from our room –\n\nAt 10 a.m., we rushed off to meet Pinoy running friends Pace Partners. I was excited to see April again, one of the founders of Pace Partners who had recently moved back to Penang from Manila. We had a filling brunch over great conversation at Central Market. It was there that I learned that the Pace Partners are great runners, but even better eaters!\n\nTogether, we visited the race start at Dataran Merdeka…\n\n– Race start is right behind us –\n\n– There you go…the race start without us blocking your view –\n\n– When you gotta go, you gotta go –\n\nWe picked up our race packets together at Stadium Titingwasa…\n\n– Just one of our many photo op stops on our way to the Stadium –\n\n– Once again, here’s the view that we blocked –\n\n– Ang iniiiiit! Let’s hope it’s cooler tomorrow –\n\n– Organizers provided free shuttle service for race packet redemption –\n\n– Nice park near the stadium –\n\n– Hubby and I after claiming our race packets. It was quick and efficient –\n\nWe shopped briefly at the small expo at the side of the stadium…\n\n– Pace Partner girls definitely know how to shop –\n\nWe ate again at Suria Mall (told you PP know how to eat!) and parted ways with the Pace Partners. Thanks to the Pace Partners for the wonderful time!\n\nHubby and I shopped to our heart’s delight at Suria and Pavillion Malls. Well, all I took home was lipstick (so if I mess up tomorrow at least I look good…kidding!)\n\n– At Pavillion Mall with aching feet. Wish me luck tomorrow. I’ve never done this much walking before a half –\n\n– Whoops…wrong sport. KL is going gaga over soccer…like the rest of the world –\n\nThen, we had a fine dinner with Renze at an Italian restaurant in Pavillion Mall before we moved into our new hotel, Impiana Hotel which is just wonderful.\n\n– with Renze, our gracious host and sponsor, and hubby –\n\nMary Grace was probably the only one who was doing the right thing the night before the race. She was resting in her hotel room. We dropped by to wish her all the best for tomorrow…\n\n– Thanks to Newton and CW-X, Mary Grace can take a shot at a podium finish for half marathon at KL Marathon –\n\nI’m all set for my half marathon tomorrow…and so is my gear…\n\nHubby is fast asleep, so I better get some shut eye too. Otherwise, he might outrun me! Sssshhhh…\n\n– Love the name that Renze put on the bib! –\n\nFor the past week, the kids have been singing (or more like screaming) Spongebob’s Best Day Ever song in the car. I have been fortunate enough to play a mini part in their duet as the background singer. On cue, I must sing “best day ever” whenever my son points at me. Disappointingly, I have been told by our very own Simon Cowell that, many a times, I am out of tune.\n\nWhether I am a good singer or not, I think the positive vibe of the song has spilled on over to my running. Yesterday morning’s run with the hubby at Filinvest, near Palm’s Country Club, was one of the best days ever in my running life this year. Finally, I got to run 5k on the road without any hint of pain. I’m definitely on the road to full recovery.\n\nTwo things I believe that contributed to the injure-free run:\n\n1. Regular deep tissue massage – I’ve been getting deep tissue massages at least twice a week for over two months now. If my muscles feel tight, I’ll have an extra session. Yes, it’s a hellish kind of experience; I sweat with the mere thought of my muscles being squeezed like clay, but it’s the main reason why my ITB disappeared completely since Condura Race.\n\n2. Midfoot landing – I’ve been focusing on my form lately, making sure I land on my midfoot and leaning a little forward. A reader from this blog and Boston Marathon finisher, Raffy, also noticed that I may be overstriding and I think he’s absolutely right. I’ve watched the Chi Running video and that’s what I’ve been trying to practice. (Note to self: watch the video again!) This Newton video also helped a lot. (Thanks to Toby and Alvin who both, by sheer coincidence, mentioned this video last week. I had seen it months ago and completely forgot about it.)\n\nNext step: Gradually build mileage again. It won’t hurt to run an easy 5k at The Southern Run too, right?"
