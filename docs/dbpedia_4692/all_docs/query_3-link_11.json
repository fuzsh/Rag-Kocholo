        "text": "What’s Up With Newton Running These Days?\n\nThese running shoes are here to stay! After some rocky stops and starts, Newton Running is going strong. We have 3 reasons to love this running shoe brand, and if you’ve never tried Newton, we suggest you stop by our store and check it out.\n\nWhere Newton Has Been\n\nRemember when the natural running trends first started circa 2008? Newton helped start that trend.\n\nA rocky point occurred when part of the company was purchased by a venture capitalist who wanted to make the brand mainstream. That didn’t work out.\n\nOne of two original founders, Jerry Lee, purchased back Newton and has helped resurrect them.\n\nNewton has since returned to its roots: focusing on a springy, lightweight shoe that dedicated runners revere.\n\n3 Reasons to Get Your Feet in Newton\n\nBREATHABLE UPPER & LIGHTWEIGHT – Newtons are designed with a roomy toebox and breathable materials. While the POP platform has a great cushioning system, the shoes are more lightweight than similar competitors.\n\nPOP PLATFORM – Unique to Newton Running Shoes, the POP platform gives that springy push-off from the midfoot. It helps quicken your cadence so you have less contact with the ground. The level platform encourages better posture while harnessing the elastic recoil of your lower legs and fascia. Meaning you’re quicker off the ground, too.\n\nENCOURAGES MIDFOOT STRIKE – The POP platform is designed to cover the midsole of your foot, and so the push-off is most beneficial when runners land on the midfoot and then give a “kiss” with the heel briefly touching the ground. Keep in mind there is no right or wrong in midfoot versus heel striking when your overall form is correct (knees are over your feet from the side view for example). We recommend a StrideSmart shoe fitting at our store to check your stride.\n\nWomen’s Gravity 8\n\nWomen’s Fate 5\n\nMen’s Gravity 8\n\nMen’s Fate 5\n\nProud to Carry Newtons Since 2014\n\nSince day one, St. Pete Running Company has carried Newton Running Shoes in store. We love these shoes. But don’t just take our word for it. Come in, let us take you through our one-of-a-kind StrideSmart Shoe Fitting process, and then you can test out the shoes to see how they feel on your feet.\n\nAuthor: Bria Burton"
