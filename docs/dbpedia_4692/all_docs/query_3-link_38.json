        "text": "Jerry Lee’s office at Newton Running headquarters in downtown Boulder is highly visible, just like the colorful running shoe he is helping stamp with a distinctive tread in the competitive, $2.3 billion running shoe business.\n\nWalk past his ground-level office at 13th and Walnut streets, the one with the long plate-glass window running the length of the sidewalk, and you will likely see Lee sitting behind his desk, or moving around a conference table surrounded by employees and a big pile of shoes and prototypes.\n\n“How’s the training going?” I asked on a recent morning.\n\n“Oh, not training much right now,” said Lee, a marathoner and Ironman finisher who overcame prostate cancer a few years back.\n\n“Injured?”\n\n“No,” he replied. “Busy.”\n\nBusy selling shoes. The first quarter of 2012 was the young company’s best by far, with record sales, new hires and more retailers carrying the shoes, which have a distinctive forefoot compressible “lug” designed to promote natural, efficient running. The growth, coming after last year’s reported $20 million investment by former Reebok executive Paul Fireman, was capped by an 11-page spread in the April issue of Runner’s World that laid out the history of the firm and the shoe’s development.\n\nWith all that behind him in the past couple of months, Lee, 62, was able to take a quick break when I interrupted him. He relaxed back in his chair and talked about the year so far. There was an enthusiasm and energy that seems to have permeated the entire company culture.\n\n“We’ve hired a bunch of young sales people, reps who were already wearing the shoes and understood what we are doing,” he said. “They are fun to be around.”\n\nWhile Ironman champ Craig Alexander and Newton co-founder Danny Abshire are the public faces of Newton, CEO Lee is the business anchor behind the firm. Lee is quiet and calm, yet with a keen business mind. He made his mark as a long-time Boulder real estate developer, putting up the One Boulder complex at Broadway and Canyon Boulevard.\n\nAnd in 1994, he was ahead of the “natural running” trend when he saw something in the shoes Abshire was developing at his Active Imprints store in the Table Mesa shopping center. It has been a long “slog” for Abshire, but his belief that there is a correct way to run kept him going, getting patents and making prototypes, until Paula Newby-Fraser, an eight-time Ironman champ, and Lee decided to invest.\n\nNewton sold its first shoes in 2007 and is now profitable.\n\nI got some idea of the appeal of the shoes over the weekend, while at the Illinois Marathon in Champaign, Ill. Chatting with Jed Bunyan, a long-time runner and co-owner of the Body n’ Sole running store, we began talking about Newton when he found out I was from Boulder.\n\n“For older guys like us, broken-down guys, the shoes can be great,” Bunyan said, as the marathon finishers passed by, happily holding their medals.\n\nI looked around to see who these “older guys” were, realizing with a frown that he was talking about me.\n\n“For some of the guys, the shoes have been really rejuvenating,” Bunyan said. “It seems to keep the pressure off the joints and knees.”\n\nLee’s daughter, Wendy, who works at Newton along with her brother, Matt, was surprised when her father got involved with a start-up running company, one with a strange feature in the shoe forefoot and named after a legendary scientist.\n\n“I was in college when the whole process started,” she said in an email. “I remember thinking how cool it was that my dad was doing this as a fun ‘little’ investment in running-shoe technology. He would wear some of the early prototypes when we’d run together; one sounded just like a horse trotting down the street. Fast forward to the point he decided they needed to launch a company instead of selling the technology.\n\n“It was very surprising, but exciting, and crazy. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought this up.”\n\nThe story is one for college business-school classes, showing how small firms such as Newton, as well as Louisville’s Pearl Izumi, find ways to create a niche in an industry dominated by global Leviathans such as Nike, Reebok and Adidas. Small firms such as Newton and Pearl Izumi have to “fight for the limited space on each retailer’s shoe wall,” says Boulder’s Brian Metzler, editor of Competitor magazine.\n\n“What has helped Newton differentiate itself is that it has developed unique technologies and also put a big emphasis on helping runners improve their form,” said Metzler, adding that Newton is one of the few firms focusing solely on running.\n\nThat is part of the plan set up by Lee, a CPA with a degree from Bradley University.\n\nHe is “a shrewd businessman with a strong work ethic,” said Metzler. “Real estate development and the running shoe industry are quite different, but the similarities are that they both require a keen attention to detail and creating product with the end customer in mind. Plus, he’s an avid runner, which has gone a long way in helping get Newton to where it is now.”\n\nNewton is a family affair. Swing by the warehouse on Frontier Avenue, and you might run into Matt loading boxes into a truck or Wendy working on an international account. Their mother, Donna, is active in many ways behind the scenes. Some of the employees, such as Boulder native and ex-Fairview runner Paul South, and Jennifer Abshire, Danny’s wife, have also been with the company from the start, giving the firm a warm, close-knit feeling.\n\n“There’s a common respect for why Newton Running exists and was founded, and a resolve to carry out the mission of the company,” said Wendy Lee, “and we have so much fun along the way.”"
