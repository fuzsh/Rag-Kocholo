        "text": "When I first heard about about the Newton Gravity + in the bright yellow, I was a fan. Who doesn’t want the most bright shoe possible? I felt like I needed sunglasses when I first opened up the box. I don’t necessarily need all my shoes in that color, but having one is super fun.\n\nNewton Gravity + Quick Facts:\n\nWeight: 7.2 oz\n\nHeel to Toe Drop: 3\n\nPrice: $190\n\nNewton Gravity + Introduction:\n\nMy first five or so years were spent running in the Newton Gravity. Throughout that time, I went through about 16 pairs. Then after working in a run specialty store that didn’t sell them anymore, I got away from them. I usually still had a pair in my rotation, but there wasn’t the “only pair.” The new updated Newton Gravity + cannot be missed. It’s the brightest shoe I’ve ever owned!\n\nNewton states the Newton Gravity+ is the first ever running shoe featuring Dupont’s Hytrel® foam Strobel. The\n\nrebound score for Hytrel foam is high, so you’ll be bouncing all over the place. If you like a “super bouncy shoe,” the Newton Gravity+ might be for you.\n\nBut remember that Newton’s running shoes have a different ride altogether. Because they have such a low drop and work your calves, it’s essential to work into them. You don’t want to take the shoes out for a 10-mile run because you will feel it in your calves.\n\nNewton and running shoes, in general, have come a long way since I ran in the Gravity in 2011. When I first purchased a pair in 2011, I believe it was $170. I thought it was “the most expensive running shoe ever.” They claimed you could get more than 1.5X mileage out of them, and you can, but that’s still expensive. These days, $170 is becoming cheaper than average for running shoes. Now the Newton Graivty+ retail at $190, which is on the pricier side but with running shoes costing $250+, it’s easier to spend $190 on a shoe that lasts 1.5X more than average.\n\nNewton Gravity + Fit:\n\nFirst, can we talk about the neon? You can’t miss the neon, and I am a fan. I don’t necessarily want every shoe in this color (although I don’t care), but it’s fun to have a super bright running shoe.\n\nNow onto actual fit…This seems to be a hot topic lately, but Newton uses a women’s specific design and fit. They’ve been doing this for a while, but recently more brands have claimed: “women’s specific fit.” Men’s and women’s feet are different, so it makes sense to tailor running shoes. Most women don’t just have smaller versions of men’s feet. At size women 11, I have a men’s sample size foot. Anyway…the Newton Gravity + has a women’s specific fit (and men’s, for that matter).\n\nThe Newton Gravity + uses an anatomically designed 3-D engineered air mesh. Its breathable and seamless construction makes it easy to put on. I firmly believe the best running shoe uppers disappear off your feet and the Newton Gravity + does just that. The mesh is exceptionally light and breathable, and the shoe fits well.\n\nNow not only is the Newton Gravity + fit good, but the laces also are 100% recycled polyester, the mesh is 100% recycled, and the midsole, membrane, and outsole use “Ecopure.”\n\nTypically, I wear between a size 10-11 wide in running shoes, and the women’s size 11 fits well.\n\nNewton Gravity + Ride:\n\nThe midsole, membrane, and outsole use “Ecopure.” What does that mean? In 2022, the Newton Gravity+ also has a Duponts Hytrel foam Strobel, making this year’s Newton Gravity + much softer and forgiving. Some might have found 2021 to be too firm.\n\nIf you’ve never run in Newtons before, it’s better to start slowly. I mean slowly because they work your calves differently than any other brand. If you flip them over, you’ll see a series of lugs that help propel you forward. These lugs, combined with the 3 mm drop, affect your calves. 3 mm drop is one of the lowest except for the 0 mm drop. Rushing into running in them can cause calf problems. Your calves will probably be sorer the first time you ever lace up a pair of Newtons. I know mine was, and it took me about a month to really work into my first pair of Newtons.\n\nThe Newton Gravity Plus uses different technology than previous versions of the Gravity. It has both “NRG+ foam” and “XPS+ Playing System,” So what does this mean? This new foam is an update to make the Newton Gravity + more modern and competitive with other trainers.\n\nWhat is the NRG+ Foam? It’s a biodegradable foam that feels more modern. Sometimes Newton could feel a little heavy, and this NRG+ foam makes the shoe pop. It reminds me a lot of Brooks’s BioMoGo DNA. The Duponts Hytrel foam Strobel keeps the Newton Gravity + much softer than the last version.\n\nWhat is the XPS+ plate? Newton Gravity + uses lugs that are air-filled chambers. This makes the shoe feel responsive, but honestly, it doesn’t feel different from previous models of the Newton Gravity. Newtons are designed to react like a spring and help propel you forward, so you’ll feel less tired the longer you go. After running for years in them, I can say this is not “just hype,” Like a carbon-plated shoe, you feel less tired at long distances.\n\nDurability and Traction: Usually, these are similar, but in Newton’s Gravity +, they are not. The durability of most Newtons is 1.5X longer than a traditional running shoe. The good news is, that’s not just hype! I’ve typically found that is the case in all of the pairs I’ve used. I rarely get more than 400 miles on running shoes, and I’ve found the Newton Gravity + to get at least 600 miles without a problem.\n\nI wasn’t sure how the Newton Gravity + would fit into my rotation. The Newton Gravity has been my “easy run shoe” in past years. I’ve found the Newton Gravity + to be best on days I have a daily run and may or may not go faster. I learn something softer with more cushion on easy run days, but the Newton Gravity + is a great shoe to bring if I don’t exactly know what kind of run I’m doing.\n\nNewton Gravity + Conclusion:\n\nNewtons are not for everyone. If you’ve tried the Newton lug system and don’t like it, then the Newton Gravity + is probably not for you. If you’ve never used Newton before, starting slowly and working into it is essential. If you are looking for a long-run or even race shoe that doesn’t have a carbon plate, the Newton Gravity+ might be a good option. It lasts longer than many traditional running shoes, and there is a lot of technology inside.\n\nIt’s funny to give a shoe that is not right for everyone a great review, but it’s a great shoe. Not every running shoe is right for everyone, but that doesn’t make it good or bad!\n\nMy Current Shoe Rotation:\n\nEasy/Daily Runs Newton Gravity +, New Balance 1080v12, Diadora Mythos Blushield Volo, Saucony Triumph 19, Brooks Launch 9,\n\nSpeed Work: Brooks Hyperion Elite 3, Altra Vanish Carbon, 361 Flame, Nike Tempo Next%, Reebok Float Ride Run fast Pro, Nike ZoomX Streakfly, Reebok Floatride Energy X\n\nLong Runs: Saucony Freedom 4, Hoka Clifton Edge,\n\nTrail Running/Hiking: Brooks Caldera 6, Saucony Peregrine 12, Hoka Torrent 2, Hoka Zinal Shoe, Speedland SL: PDX,\n\nRaces: Nike ZoomX Streakfly, Asics Metaspeed Sky, Hoka One One Rocket X, adidas Adizero Pro, New Balance Fuelcell 5280, Nike Next%, Saucony Endorphin Pro 2, Reebok Run fast Pro\n\nYou Can See All Current Shoe Reviews Here.\n\nLooking to learn more about running shoes?
