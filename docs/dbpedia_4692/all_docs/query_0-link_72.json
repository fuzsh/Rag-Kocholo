        "text": "Facebook\n\nThreads\n\nX\n\nBluesky\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nSlippery Soles: A Lesson In Friction\n\nGrade Level\n\n6 - 8\n\nminutes\n\n1- 2 hrs\n\nsubject\n\nPhysical Science\n\nActivity Type:\n\nengineering and design challenge\n\nEven in our best winter boots, we often slip and slide on icy sidewalks. Researchers at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute noticed this problem and decided to investigate just how resistant winter boots are to slippery conditions. They tested more than 100 boots on an icy incline and found that only about 10 percent enabled the wearer to walk up a seven-degree slant without slipping.\n\nHow can we create a better winter boot?\n\nCheck out the researchers’ data on their site Rate My Treads. The “snowflake scale” indicates how well a boot gripped the ice. Are you surprised by some of the shoes on this list that didn’t stand up to the test?\n\nHow can we redesign a shoe that earns a three-snowflake rating on the snowflake scale? In this activity, you will investigate some of the factors that affect a shoe’s ability to grip icy surfaces, then use your new knowledge to improve a shoe’s traction.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at our shoes.\n\nGrab at least four different shoes from the closet. Sort them into groups based on what they’re used for. Notice the diversity of tread pattern and material. As you examine the shoes, consider their purpose. Think about what makes each shoe unique.\n\nWhat are these shoes designed for? (E.g., basketball, running, cold weather, warm weather, etc.)\n\nWhat do you notice about the tread patterns?\n\nWhy would different types of shoes need different treads?\n\nWhat about each shoe’s tread makes it suited to the surface you would wear it on?\n\nWhy do we slip on ice?\n\nIn most cases, your shoes make a firm connection with the ground, while in others—like when you’re walking on ice—your shoes slide much more easily. What contributes to your grip on a surface? Whether you slip or walk easily across terrain has a lot to do with friction, a force that opposes the motion of surfaces in contact with one another.\n\nWe encounter friction every day, all around us. It’s one of the forces that slows a rolling ball to a stop and keeps a ladder leaned against a wall. Often, we can detect friction by the energy that it gives off as heat. If you quickly rub your hands together, you should feel warmth. That’s caused by friction.\n\nThe amount of friction that exists between two objects depends in part on how easily their surfaces move against each other, a measure called the coefficient of friction. Try sliding on a wood floor in socks and then sliding across a carpet in socks. Notice the difference? The coefficient of friction between your socks and the wood floor and between your socks and the carpet are different.\n\nGenerally, when smooth surfaces are in contact with each other, the coefficient of friction is lower, which indicates slipping and sliding. Between rough surfaces, the coefficient of friction is higher, meaning better traction.\n\nWhich scenario will have the higher coefficient of friction: a cardboard box moving across the asphalt, or a cardboard box moving along a polished wood floor?\n\nIf you said a cardboard box on asphalt would have a higher coefficient of friction, you’re right. The smooth wooden floor provides less friction against the cardboard box, and therefore the coefficient of friction is lower.\n\nEven surfaces that seem really smooth to our naked eye can appear surprisingly rough and uneven under high-powered microscopes, and can contribute to friction when we walk across them. That’s why you eventually come to a stop when sliding across a wood floor in your socks!\n\nLet’s take a closer look at ice.\n\nListen to the audio clip below. Here, physicist Robert Carpick describes why ice is slippery.\n\nPrint this transcript.\n\nWhy does walking on ice feel different from walking on other surfaces?\n\nLike Carpick says, the surface of ice is very different from other surfaces we’re familiar with. Scientists think that what makes ice slippery is a microscopic layer of water on the surface.\n\nThink back to when you slid on the smooth wood floor in socks. Now imagine adding marbles beneath your feet. They would make the wood much more slippery, right? Those marbles are somewhat like the liquid layer on the surface of ice.\n\nThe slip factor between your shoe and ice requires some special design consideration. Let’s take a look at the shoes worn by people who spend a lot of time on ice, such as curlers, mountaineers, and indigenous peoples. While viewing the images, record observations of each shoe (i.e. tread, materials) on a sheet of paper.\n\nHow do animals walk on slippery ice?\n\nLet’s explore some of the adaptations animals have evolved to navigate slippery ice. While looking at the images, add observations underneath your shoe notes. Consider the following questions:\n\nWhat kinds of features or textures do you notice?\n\nDo any of the animal features—fur, claws, or bumpy pads—remind you of what you saw in the mukluks, curling shoes, or microspikes?\n\nWhat surfaces is the organism traveling over?\n\nAre there ideas or structures you could imitate to improve your own shoes?\n\nDesign a better shoe.\n\nIn the tests done by the Toronto-based team for Rate My Treads, only nine boots out of nearly 100 could handle a seven-degree incline without slipping. You are going to conduct two tests to identify how sole material and tread surface area affect friction on ice. Then you will use your data to redesign or adjust a sole to improve its grip on ice.\n\nInvestigation 1: Does sole material affect friction?\n\nIn the following investigation, you’ll cover shoe print cutouts with three different types of material. Then you’ll test how well each model grips a wooden ramp by calculating its speed as it slides down.\n\nMaterials\n\nCardboard or card stock for shoe print\n\nShoe Print Template\n\nAdhesive materials: duct tape, masking tape, hot glue, rubber bands, string, etc.\n\nSole materials: You can use any on-hand materials from your classroom or household. Some recommended materials include sand, sand paper, salt, recycled materials, wax, Brillo pads, shelf liners, cling wrap, aluminum foil, wood scraps, fabric scraps, etc.\n\nScissors\n\nStopwatch\n\nRulers or measuring tape\n\nWooden ramp (at least three feet long)\n\nShoe weight (at least 250 grams, created from weights, bags of sand or flour, paper weight, etc.)\n\nMaterials Worksheet\n\nTesting Protocol\n\nPrepare your models\n\nCreate three shoe prints from card stock or cardboard using the template provided.\n\nSelect three different materials to use for your soles. As you make your choices, examine each material. What are some of its characteristics (e.g., texture, weight)? How does it compare to animal adaptations and shoes designed for ice? What do you think would happen if you slid this material on ice?\n\nCover the entire bottom of each shoe print in one of your chosen materials. It is important that the material covers the entire sole.\n\nTest your models\n\nAttach a weight to the top of one model. (It’s important that the same weight be used in each test.)\n\nPosition the model at the top of the wooden ramp. Let the model slide down the ramp, and time its descent. Make sure you start the timer as soon as you release the model and stop it when the model hits the ground.\n\nCalculate the speed of the model using the formula Speed = Distance/Time. (Find the distance by measuring the length of the ramp, in meters.)\n\nRecord your result in the table on your Materials Worksheet.\n\nRepeat Steps 1-4 for each model.\n\nCreate a bar graph of your results on your Materials Worksheet.\n\nAnalysis Questions\n\n— Which material caused the model to travel the fastest?\n\n— Which material caused the model to travel the slowest?\n\n— Based on your data, how does each material that you tested affect friction?\n\nRemember, a slower speed indicates an increase in friction.\n\nInvestigation 2: Does tread surface area affect friction?\n\nIn this investigation, you’ll apply three tread patterns with different surface areas to shoe print cutouts. Once again, you’ll test how well each model grips a wooden ramp by calculating its speed as it slides down.\n\nMaterials\n\nCardboard or card stock\n\nShoe Print Template\n\nScissors\n\nGlue\n\nShoe weight (from Investigation #1)\n\nWooden ramp (at least three feet long)\n\nStopwatch\n\nRulers or measuring tape\n\nPaint\n\nGraph paper\n\nSurface Area Worksheet\n\nTesting Protocol\n\nPrepare your models\n\nMake three more shoe prints from card stock or cardboard, using the template or your own shoe.\n\nCut out various shapes of different sizes from cardboard. These pieces will be used to create treads.\n\nCreate three shoe soles with distinctly different tread patterns. One shoe should have a tread pattern with a small surface area (meaning that very little of the tread would come in contact with the ground). Another should have a large surface area (meaning that lots of the tread would come in contact with the ground). And the last tread pattern should fall somewhere in the middle.\n\nGlue the shapes to the bottom of each shoe print. Be sure the shapes do not extend past the edges of the cutout.\n\nHow did you ensure that your designs represent three different surface areas?\n\nTest your models\n\nAttach a weight to the top of one model. (It’s important that the same weight be used in each test.)\n\nPosition a model at the top of the wooden ramp. Let the model slide down the ramp, and time its descent. Make sure you start the timer as soon as you release the model and stop it when the model hits the ground.\n\nCalculate the speed of the model using the formula Speed = Distance/Time. (If you used the same ramp as in the previous experiment, use the same length for distance.)\n\nRecord your result in the table on your Surface Area Worksheet.\n\nRepeat Steps 1-4 for each model.\n\nDetermine the surface area of your treads\n\nUsing paint, coat the bottom of one model. Press the paint-coated side to a sheet of 1-cm graph paper.\n\nCount the squares that are filled with paint to estimate the surface area of the tread.\n\nRecord the surface area on your Surface Area Worksheet.\n\nRepeat Steps 1-3 for each shoe model.\n\nCreate a line graph of your results on your Surface Area Worksheet.\n\nAnalysis Questions\n\n— Which model traveled the fastest?\n\n— Which model traveled the slowest?\n\n— Based on your data, are there any general observations you can make about the relationship between surface area of the tread and friction?\n\nUse your data to make a better shoe.\n\nNow that you have investigated the impact of sole material and tread surface area on shoe grip, you can use your data to help you create a winter shoe (or boot) design that grips the ice instead of sending you tumbling.\n\nPrepare an ice test ramp.\n\nYou will need to prepare an ice ramp at least one full day before testing. Find a large tray or shallow container that is at least 18 inches in length. Fill the tray with water and freeze it for at least 24 hours. The deeper the tray, the longer the water will take to freeze. On test day, remove your tray from the freezer, and use a protractor to prop it up to a seven-degree incline on common household materials such as marker boxes, notebooks, or books.\n\nMaterials\n\nDesign materials: You can use any on-hand materials from your classroom or household. Some recommended materials include sand, sand paper, salt, recycled materials, wax, Brillo pads, shelf liners, cling wrap, aluminum foil, wood scraps, fabric scraps, etc.\n\n1 used, disposable boot or sneaker (if you don’t have a boot, use a shoe print cutout)\n\nAdhesive materials: duct tape, masking tape, hot glue, rubber bands, string, etc.\n\nShoe weight (a bag of flour or sand works best for this step)\n\nScissors\n\nIce ramp (see instructions above)\n\nSpring scale (Newtons)\n\nPaint\n\nGraph paper\n\nCardboard\n\nRulers or measuring tape\n\nProtractor\n\nEngineering Design Plan Worksheet\n\nPreliminary Testing\n\nFirst, you’ll test your unmodified shoe’s grip on the ice ramp. Prop the ice ramp up at a seven-degree incline. Follow the steps of the testing protocol below for each test.\n\nReflect on your preliminary data.\n\nWhat features contributed to your unmodified shoe’s grip on the ice?\n\nCompare your unmodified shoe to shoes designed for use on ice, and to adaptations that animals have evolved for moving on ice. What similarities and differences do you see?\n\nWhat changes can you make to your shoe using what you learned about nature, shoes designed for ice, and the data you collected earlier?\n\nRedesign your shoe.\n\nChallenge\n\nUsing common classroom or household materials, redesign the sole of your shoe to increase the friction and the force needed to pull it. Your modification cannot add more than one inch in height to the shoe and must be no larger than the sole of the shoe. Use your data from the sole material and tread surface area investigations to guide your design process.\n\nImagine\n\nBrainstorm ideas for your design by sketching them out on the Engineering Design Worksheet. Think big and be creative!\n\n— What qualities do shoes designed for ice have that you could replicate?\n\n— Think about the results of your tests on sole material and tread surface area. Could you mix and match the designs you came up with?\n\n— What will the bottom of this shoe look like?\n\n— How much of the shoe will come in contact with the ice?\n\nPlan\n\nSelect the best design elements from your brainstorming, and sketch them into a blueprint that you will use to build your shoe. Your blueprint diagram should include a profile view of your sole in contact with the ice as well as a view of your tread pattern.\n\n— Which elements of this design do you think might improve your shoe’s grip on the ice?\n\n— How does your design draw from your previous sole material and tread surface area tests?\n\n— Explain what you would expect to see at the microscopic level when this newly designed tread comes in contact with the ice.\n\nBuild\n\nUsing your chosen materials and blueprint, build your new sole.\n\nTest\n\nFollow the testing protocol you used to test your unmodified shoe. Record your results on the Engineering Design Worksheet.\n\nImprove Your Design\n\nWant to continue improving your design? Try changing a single feature at a time, testing each change to see how it affects the interaction between the sole and the ice. Track the changes you made on your Engineering Design Worksheet. Which changes had the greatest impact on the grip of your shoe on the ice?\n\nCommunicate\n\nCreate a mini poster presentation of your design to share with your classmates. In your presentation, include your graphic data, prototypes, and surface area tread prints.\n\nCompare your designs.\n\nNow that you have designed your shoe, let’s see how your findings compare to the research collected by the Toronto scientists. Researcher Barry Westhead, who led the team, describes how shoe design is progressing, and the materials that scientists are currently testing.\n\nPrint this transcript.\n\n— Does your design reflect any features of today’s cutting-edge designs?\n\n— Now that you’re familiar with what shoe designers and researchers are currently investigating, how would you further modify your design?\n\n— What are some of the limitations you had that a real shoe designer wouldn’t have?\n\n— How could your design be used in a shoe developed by experts?\n\nNext Generation Science Standards And Notes From The Field\n\nNext Generation Science Standards\n\nMS-ETS1-1.
