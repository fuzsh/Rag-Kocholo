        "text": "A review of Newton running shoes, Baleaf workout clothes and Splendid Spoon smoothies and pasta.\n\nNewton Running Shoes- Motion 9\n\nI got to try a new-to-me brand of running shoes and I am so excited about it. I love running, walks and lifting weights and something like a new pair of shoes is very motivating and exciting. I heard great things about Newton Running Shoes and looked up the kind that would be best for my foot. After taking a quiz which variety would be best for stability control and cushioning, I landed upon the women's Motion 9. I saw that they came in a bright pink color and was instantly sold. I love bright colored running shoes.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the shoes because Newton running shoes have a \"Newtonium Cushioning System\" which has a bar on the bottom of the shoes. I thought I didn't like it at first but quickly got used to it. I love the shoes for walking- 2-3 miles at a time. I ran 5.5 miles in the shoes so far. I found them to be less cushioned than other shoes that I've worn. They are quite lightweight and very breathable which I liked for walking but like a very cushioned shoe for running due to the different issues that I have with my feet.\n\nOverall, I do like these Newton Running shoes and will continue to try them out for running a bit but you will definitely see me out walking in these.\n\nBaleaf Workout Clothes\n\nIn the fall, winter and spring, you can find me in these cozy jackets all the time. I love this sherpa pullover from Baleaf. It is very warm and great for wearing on hikes. I started loving Baleaf clothing in the fall and love their joggers a bunch and their leggings.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that my husband had already been wearing Baleaf clothes before me! He ordered some on Amazon over the summer and he really likes them. He has a hard time finding men's running clothes and loves the Baleaf 5\" running shorts. He doesn't like shorts too long for running and these are perfect. They are lightweight and feel comfortable while he is running. I love that Baleaf is affordable with most items about $20-25. Their beach shorts are going to be great for the summer.\n\nSplendid Spoon\n\nI can't say enough great things about Splendid Spoon. All of the smoothies are super delicious! They are already blended up and you just have to pour them. I love the rich dessert-like varieties like the mint chip smoothie and the strawberry goji smoothie. They are thick and packed with nutrients. So great for a busy day.\n\nThe Splendid Spoon noodles are all so delicious also. This year, with the kids doing school from home, has been extra busy and I do not have a lot of time to prepare lunch. I absolutely love pulling one of these from the freezer and heating it up for lunch ready in 3-4 minutes. This noodle bowl is the Creamy Mushroom and Spinach Noodles. I love every single variety that I have tried of the noodles- especially the Asian varieties. If your life is busy and you don't have a lot of time to prepare food but you want to eat healthy, I definitely recommend Splendid Spoon smoothies and noodle bowls.\n\nSamples were provided for review purposes.
