        "text": "Hello and welcome back to The Dance Docs!\n\nDuring an early episode Dr. Davenport and I mentioned how much we love talking about shoes, and many people responded that they wanted to know more. So on this week's episode Dr. Davenport and I sat down to discuss all things shoes and answer a few listener questions. We cover a wide range from sneakers to dance shoes, running shoes to CAM Boots and everything in between. I hope that you get a lot out of this conversation on all things shoes.\n\nThere is no perfect shoe for everyone, and no cookie cutter approach. We make recommendations based on the current research and clinical knowledge. Just like a good pair of dance shoes it is worth the time to go see someone to be fit for the proper pair of sneakers, and can take time to find the right fit.\n\nOutside of dance footwear\n\nNarrow vs wide vs functional/anatomical\n\nWide shoe makes the shoe wider through the midfoot\n\nFunctional or anatomical shoes makes the toe box wider and gives more space for the ball of the foot\n\nWant to find support for the foot without over controlling the motion\n\nDancer feet\n\nModern dancers who are dancing barefoot usually have good control and stability through feet\n\nImportant for ballet dancers to continue working in a soft ballet slipper and not just in pointe shoes as they become more advanced\n\nBallet training progresses from slippers and articulating through feet to help the dancer build strength and control necessary for pointe work. You don’t want to abandon it once you go en pointe\n\nBallet shoes\n\nWant to make sure that the ballet slippers fit properly\n\nMale dancers have a tendency to wear shoes very tight\n\nConsider wearing a shoe that is slightly larger, or in socks\n\nWear a smaller shoe that is more shaped to your foot for performances only\n\nPump Bump\n\nCaused by pressure on the heel from tight draw strings\n\nCan be female dancers in tight pointe shoes, or male dancers in tight ballet slippers\n\nApolla Socks\n\nGreat for support of the foot without overly constricting the ball of the foot\n\nHave recommended for dancers with heel pain, big toe pain, or bunion pain\n\nShoe recommendations for when you are injured\n\nFlexible vs stiff shoes\n\nnatural/Barefoot\n\nFootware providing minimal interface with the natural movement of the foot due to it’s high flexibility, low heel toe drop, weight and stack height, and the absence of motion control and stability devices\n\nSomeone who needs to build strength in the foot\n\nMay be appropriate for a ballroom dancer, or ballet, modern jazz dancer during the off season\n\nClog\n\nStiff sole shoe, are designed to allow for proper gait mechanics without having to actually roll through or use the foot\n\nMay be appropriate for someone with stress fractures as a transition between boot and a flexible shoe\n\nTennis shoe/ running/ sneaker\n\nLives kinda in the middle, can take on aspects of a natural or barefoot shoe with increased cushioning, may provide a lot of stability\n\nRocker bottom?\n\nHave a thicker than normal sole with a rounded heel and toe\n\nPros: can off load rolling through the foot, and decrease work from the toes\n\nMay help hallux rigidus, plantar fasciitis, etc.\n\nHallux rigidus/hallux limitus\n\nBony block vs functional\n\nCan help transition midfoot issues (stress fractures)\n\nStill need to strengthen foot to restore the mechanics\n\nOften have lots of cushion and shock absorption\n\nHigher stack height\n\nMany shoes are modified rocker these days\n\nHoka shoes are designed with a Meta-Rocker, which is built into the mid- and outsoles, near the metatarsal bones in your feet. We break the Meta-Rocker into two categories: early-stage and late-stage.\n\nEarly-stage Meta-Rocker, the transition zone is placed behind the metatarsal heads. This helps create a smoother ride and a faster transition to the forefoot.\n\nLate-stage Meta-Rocker have the transition zone placed in front of the metatarsal heads, which provides a more stable base of forefoot support.\n\nClifton/ most of their shoes- Early stage Meta-Rocker\n\nGaviota, all hiking models- late stage meta-rocker\n\nCons: can feel unstable\n\nMay not be the best choice for instability (ankle sprains, etc.)\n\nIf lived in these shoes 24/7 could weaken the feet\n\ngood for recovery, not great for wearing all the time forever\n\nNot a long term solution- can lead to less ROM at great toe\n\nRecovery shoe\n\nMay need to give your feet a rest in a high cushioned shoe\n\nNot the shoes that you want to wear all of the time\n\nWant to make sure that the shoes are still offering some mobility through the foot and not allowing it to fully shut down\n\nTo insole or not to insole\n\nThere is a place for them\n\nI always ask what is the end game for the insole?\n\nFor the majority of people it is not the long term solution. Focusing on strengthening the foot and ankle should be part of the plan. Also need to make sure to address any strength deficiencies farther up the chain in the hip, knee and back\n\nWe don’t tell you to wear a back brace forever, so why are we doing this to the feet\n\nIf your feet had a 6 pack we would all care about them\n\nWe never say never in medicine, but I almost never recommend these without PT and strengthening\n\nPros: Can use for acute injuries to offload an injury, and they can support the arch\n\nCons: can weaken feet\n\nMust wean into these (start 1 hour, and increase gradually)\n\nDon’t just want to put an orthotic in your shoe, your shoe may already have the necessary support\n\nHave to look at the whole system\n\nUnderstanding built in shoe support\n\nFirst things I do when i am assessing someone for sneakers or running shoes\n\nWant to look at their heel position in normal resting stance\n\npronation/ neutral/ supination\n\nWhat is their hindfoot mobility like\n\nFull body rotation- can the hindfoot pronate and supinate?\n\nLook at the bottom of previous shoes\n\nWhat is the wear pattern like?\n\nIs it medial- may have someone who over pronates\n\nDo they have wear over the lateral heel and big toe- pretty normal and strong foot\n\nIs it lateral- do they have a history of lateral ankle sprains and instability of the chain?\n\nPronation/Stability\n\nPronation is a rolling in of the foot- Look at this from behind and what the calcaneus (heel bone is doing)\n\nEveryone's foot needs to pronate, don’t be scared of the pronation\n\nSomeone with a true hindfoot pronation and lack of muscular support may be a good candidate for a pronation support shoes\n\nThis does not mean that there is more arch support!\n\nThe shoe contains a more dense foam on the medial side (inside of the shoes) that acts as a post for the calcaneus driving it into a more neutral position\n\nIf you are walking this might be ok, but i have seen many runners and dancers in the clinic that end of up with knee pain from their shoes being over supporting and overloading the medial side of the leg\n\nNeutral\n\nHas the same density foam throughout the sole of the shoe\n\nWhere I start most people\n\nSupination\n\nHas increased cushioning on the lateral side of the shoe to cushion a more rigid foot\n\nRecommend for someone with a true rigid foot or a hindfoot that is in a supinated position\n\nMedical footwear\n\nMedical Shoe\n\nShort boot\n\nCAM boot (full boot)\n\nWhat kind of shoe should I wear if I am in a Boot (CAM boot- controlled ankle motion)\n\nWant to find a shoe with a stack high of ~25-30mm\n\nCAM boot is designed as a rocker bottom\n\nGreat options are\n\nmany of the HOKA models- usually recommend the clifton\n\nAltra Paradigm, Provision, Torrin\n\nIf you don’t want to purchase shoes, you can find a specific shoe lift called the Leveler or Even-Up that is adjustable and slips right over current shoes that you own\n\nDance footwear\n\nMost important thing is to give yourself time to adjust to your shoes\n\nPointe shoes\n\nListener question- Dancer who wants to wear pointe shoes at home… yea or ney\n\nDepends on if you have a home studio with an appropriate floor surface, and do you know how to work your feet.\n\nIf you are going to go against the advice, make sure that you are being safe and not trying things that you are not ready for.\n\nThank you for visiting our show notes. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us!\n\nIn Health,\n\nDr. Kat Bower PT, DPT"
