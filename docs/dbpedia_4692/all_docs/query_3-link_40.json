        "text": "Hoka: Finally, a triathlon running shoe that goes a long way to genuinely supporting the needs of many longer-distance athletes, Hoka Running Shoes. If your limiter is mechanical fatigue and muscular damage, the Hoka shoe designs are a solid option to provide support and comfort without massively increasing the shoe's weight. Other companies have mimicked the more cushioned design and are equally viable options. The key is to test run various models to secure the shoes that suit your foot and provide the right cushion without losing foot speed (ground contact time must remain low). The models have high design variability and feel in the upper mesh, so trying on a few is essential. Ensure you don’t think of these as regular running shoes or go on a quest to mimic how other shoes feel. Instead, stay light on your feet and embrace the ‘cloud-like’ cushion you gain. Note: I have no relationship with the brand.\n\nOn: A relative newbie in the running shoe world has recently attracted some attention. They are set apart from the crowd with a radical design that claims to be in equal parts cushioned and light. While some of these claims may seem attractive, the technology is not fully established, and we haven’t seen enough positive gains from choosing this shoe to endorse it as a choice. Many folks enjoy the feeling and comfort in walking and daily life from this shoe, which might be a nice option. Supportive and cushioned. For running, the concept remains interesting but not proven at all.\n\nNewton: Newton Running shoes have been around for a while now and are well designed and a solid option for the proper athlete, but that athlete likely isn’t you. Promoting a forefoot landing and push-off, which is mostly unattainable for the average amateur beginning their run off the bike, these shoes end up promoting calf and Achilles stress, particularly for those not used to the position. The shoes also push you to retain the form that most folks just don’t have the capacity to do in a run following swim and bike. Long-distance triathlon running form is closer to walking fast than it is to the world's fastest one miler’s form. Stay upright and stable with good foot speed throughout.\n\nNike Vaporfly: Plenty of folks have jumped on the Nike Vaporfly bandwagon, especially following some of the performances of their elite runners. There have been massive technological advances in their shoe construction, but most of these are not focused on helping you run faster in your triathlon. The very narrow heel cup and midfoot area can cause both rubbing around the runner’s heel, but many folks also experience ‘fall off’ the side of the shoe. This is exacerbated by fatigue. I have seen too many athletes pushing hard, with the shoe's heel at 45 degrees away from the center. The Nike Vaporfly are impressive racing shoes, but only for the genetically chosen few. In all likelihood, these will just injure you.\n\nRacing flats: Choose a brand, and dismiss any model that promotes shoes as the lightest, fastest, or track-like. You must ignore the more lightweight shoes that help reduce ground contact time in favor of the very real limiter of mechanical fatigue. Prioritize the latter, and be happy with a shoe you can spend time training in. It will help you throughout your run, especially the back half of the racecourse. Finally, be sure to use your racing show a few times before race day. Their feel shouldn’t be a complete surprise.\n\nI hope that helps provide some insights into shoe choice. Of course, you must choose wisely, have two pairs of shoes on the go simultaneously, and always refer to pragmatism over dogmatic marketing."
