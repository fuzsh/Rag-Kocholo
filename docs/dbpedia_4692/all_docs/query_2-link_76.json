        "text": "Putting on my Newton Kismet running shoes makes me want to move!\n\nDisclosure: Newton Running is supporting our 2015 Cabot Fit Team and providing a new pair of running shoes for the race. I was not expected to write this post. I was not financially compensated for my time. Opinions are my own.\n\nIs it better to be faster than slower? This question reminds me of the AT&T commercials, and who doesn’t want faster service? But what about running? Should you try to run faster? I’ve already mentioned in previous posts (here and here) that I’m jumping on the faster (running) bandwagon in hopes to set a PR at the Beach 2 Beacon Road Race in Cape Elizabeth, Maine running with the Cabot Fit Team.\n\nI’m about 4 weeks into my new training and so far I have managed to avoid one of the biggest risks of running faster: injury (knock wood). But I haven’t avoided ALL the cons of running faster: the work, the sweat, the pain. It’s not fun.\n\nHere’s what’s helping me push through my slowness ..\n\n1. Faster tempo music. Please stay tuned for an updated playlist!\n\n2. These:\n\nNewton Kismet running shoes are making me feel faster. It’s a feeling I can’t explain, but it’s there. Why did I starting running in this shoe after 20+ years in another brand? It was shear serendipity. That’s right, I never shopped around for a different shoe. A better shoe. A faster shoe. But when Newton running asked members of the Cabot Fit team,\n\nWhat’s important to you in a running shoe?\n\nhere’s what I told them:\n\nI need a stability shoe, a wide toe box, and I run 25 miles weekly, but I’m trying to cut it back and improve my speed.\n\nI have to say, they nailed it! I love the support for my significantly pronated gait! These shoes are moderately soft, comfortable, much lighter than my previous trainers, and make me feel energetic. The fit is perfection; not too tight but not too loose, and plenty of wiggle room for my piggies. I logged 14 miles in these my first week and I have had NO break-in blisters or discomfort of any kind. A terrific transition to a terrific shoe . Don’t take my word for it, discover for yourself what they mean when they say #feelNewton!\n\nWhat attributes do you look for in a running shoe?"
