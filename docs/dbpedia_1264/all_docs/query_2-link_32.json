        "text": "The Indian state of West Bengal is the site of India's first modern university. Thirty-three universities are listed in the state by the University Grants Commission.[1]\n\nIn West Bengal the medium of instruction in colleges and universities is usually Bengali or English. Diploma, certificate courses, advanced diploma program, postgraduate courses and doctoral programs are offered. Research programs offered by the universities are conducted with the aid of specialised institutes.\n\nKolkata, the capital of West Bengal has played a pioneering role in the development of the modern education system in India. Western models of education came to India through this city. Many of the first schools and colleges were established by the missionaries and reformists. Sir William Jones (philologist) established the Asiatic Society in 1784 for promoting oriental studies. People like Ram Mohan Roy, David Hare, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Ashutosh Mukherjee and William Carey played a leading role in the setting up of modern schools and colleges in the city. The Fort William College was established in 1800. The Hindu College was established in 1817, renamed the Presidency College in 1855.[2]\n\nWilliam Carey established the Serampore College in the city of Serampore in 1818. It went on to become India's first modern university in 1827 when it was incorporated by a Royal Charter as a Danish University. The Sanskrit College was established in 1824. Reverend Alexander Duff of the Church of Scotland established the General Assembly's Institution in 1830 and later the Free Church Institution in 1844, which were later merged to form what is now known as the Scottish Church College, Calcutta. These institutions played a significant role in what came to be known as the Young Bengal Movement and the Bengal Renaissance. La Martiniere Calcutta was established in 1836.\n\nThe oldest medical school in Asia, the Calcutta Medical College was set up in 1835. In 1857, the University of Calcutta was established as the first full-fledged multi-disciplinary university in south Asia. It was modelled on the lines of the University of London. Today it is amongst the largest multidisciplinary universities of India and offers some of the widest number of academic disciplines for study.\n\nJohn Bethune established a school for Indian girls in 1850 at a time when women's education was frowned upon in the society. The Bethune College for girls was set up by him in 1879.[3]\n\nIn 1856 technical and engineering education came with the establishment of a civil engineering college / department. This setup went through various reorganisations to finally become the Bengal Engineering College in 1921. The Jesuit administered St Xavier's College was established in 1860. Bengal Engineering and Science University is the second oldest engineering institutes in the country and it was started in the year 1864. They offer the following programs such as B.E, M.E, MCA, MBA, MSC, B. Arch. and Ph.D. programs. Apart from this they also provide part-time courses in the evening for the professionals.[4][better source needed]\n\nThe nation's first homoeopathy college was established in the city in 1880. In 1883 Kadambini Ganguly and Chandramukhi Basu became the first women graduates from the University of Calcutta. In the process, they became the first female graduates of the British Empire. Kadambini went on to become the first female physician trained in the Western system of medicine in South Asia.\n\nIn 1906, the partition of Bengal led to widespread nationalistic and anti-British feelings.[5] This led to the setting up of the National Council of Education, Bengal. The Science College was established in 1917. The first blind school came into being in 1925.\n\nAfter independence, Calcutta continued to be in the forefront of the educational scene. The Government College of Art & Craft was established in 1951. The National Council of Education became the Jadavpur University in 1955. The Rabindra Bharati University was established in 1962. This university offers courses in the fine and performing arts. The Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management was set up in 1953 as the country's first management institute and is also the first in the country to offer an MBA degree of a university. The first, Indian Institute of Technology was set up at Kharagpur about 120 km (75 mi) from Calcutta. In 1960 the Regional Engineering college (presently National Institute of Technology) at Durgapur was set up. It is amongst the top NITs in India and also among the oldest. Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, the first among the Indian Institutes of Management, was set up in 1961 at Joka. It was the first national institute for post-graduate studies and research in management sciences. It was established with the help of the MIT Sloan School of Management and the Ford Foundation.\n\nInstitutes and universities with particular special status or funding arrangements include: Institutes of Eminence (IoE), Institutes of National Importance (INI); central universities, Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTI); and the deemed universities. Types with specialist functions include research institutes and universities with national recognition for their field of education.\n\nList of institutes and universities with special status or funding Institution Location Status (Type) Established Specialisation Sources Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur IoE Jadavpur University IoE* *Note: recommended only, pending as of 2023 Indian Institute of Management Calcutta Joka INI (Autonomous) 1961 Social Sciences and Management [6] Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata Haringhata INI (Autonomous) 2006 Basic sciences, applied sciences [7] Indian Statistical Institute Baranagar INI (Autonomous) 1959 Basic sciences, applied sciences, social sciences [8] Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur Kharagpur INI (Autonomous) 1951 Science, Management, Engineering & Technology, Law [9] Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur Howrah INI (Autonomous) 1856 Sciences, Management, Engineering & Technology [10] Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kalyani Kalyani INI (Autonomous) 2014 Engineering & Technology, Sciences [11] National Institute of Technology, Durgapur Durgapur INI (Autonomous) 1960 Engineering & Technology, Sciences, Management [12] National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Kolkata Kolkata INI (Autonomous) 2007 Pharmacy [13] All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalyani Kalyani INI (Autonomous) 2019 Medical, Nursing [14] Visva-Bharati University Shantiniketan Central University 1921 Arts, Sciences, Social Work, Agriculture, Fine arts, Designing, Music, Drama [15] Ghani Khan Choudhury Institute of Engineering & Technology Malda district GFTI 2010 Engineering [16] Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science Kolkata Deemed university 1876 Basic sciences, applied sciences [17] Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute Belur Math Deemed university 2005 Agricultural Management, Rural Development, Basic Sciences, Indian Culture and Spirituality [18] National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research, Kolkata Kolkata Deemed university 1965 Engineering & Technology [19] Status categories: IoE – Institutes of Eminence; INI – Institutes of National Importance; GFTI – Government Funded Technical Institutes\n\nResearch institutes and specialist universities Institution Location Status (Type) Established Specialisation Sources All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health Kolkata Research institute 1932 Hygiene and Public Health [20] S.
