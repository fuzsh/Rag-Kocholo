It is affiliated to University of Burdwan.[1] It has a sprawling campus of 7.62 acre, which is lush-green and clustered around with naturally grown trees. The College is rapidly growing with the help of the UGC and the state government and now hosts near about 800 students. However, the students that mostly comes in the College for higher education are from rural belt and not-so-well-off families. The College is a new lifeline for the raw talenets of this area which has remained more or less underdeveloped in comparison to the other districts in the State."
