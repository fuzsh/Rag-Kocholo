UNDER THE CHOICE BASED CREDIT SYSTEM (CBCS)\n\nPRESCRIBED BY\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF BURDWAN\n\nE_Prospectus_2020_21\n\nUnder the CBCS there are broadly two course structures---i) Honours Course, ii) Regular/General Course.\n\nThe main components of the courses are as follows:\n\n1. Core Course: A course which should compulsorily be studied by a candidate as a core requirement, is termed as a core course.\n\n2. Elective Course: Generally a course which can be chosen from a pool of courses and which may be very specific or specialized or advanced or supportive to the discipline/subject of study or which provides an extended scope or which enables an exposure to some other discipline/subject/domain or nurtures the candidate's proficiency/skill, is called an Elective Course.\n\n2.1 Discipline Specific Elective (DSE) Course: A course which may be offered by the main discipline/subject of study, is referred to as Discipline Specific Elective.\n\n2.2 Generic Elective (GE) Course: An elective course, chosen generally from an unrelated discipline/subject of study with an intention to seek an exposure, is called a Generic Course.\n\nN.B. - A Core Course, offered in a discipline/subject, may be treated as an elective by another discipline/subject and vice- versa and such electives may also be referred to as Generic Elective.\n\n2.3 Dissertation/Project: An elective course, designed to acquire special/advanced knowledge, is termed as dissertation/project. This is considered as a special course involving application of knowledge in solving/analyzing/exploring a real life situation/difficult problem. A dissertation/project work will be of 6 credits. A dissertation/project work may be given in lieu of a Discipline Specific Elective.\n\n3. Ability Enhancement Courses (AEC): The Ability Enhancement (AE) Courses may be of two kinds- Ability Enhancement Compulsory Courses (AECC) and Skill Enhancement Courses (SEC).\n\n3.1 AECC: These are the courses based on the contents that lead to knowledge enhancement and consist of Environmental Studies & Communicative English/MIL.
