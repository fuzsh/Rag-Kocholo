        "text": "Submitted my thesis titled ‘Socioeconomic Mobility and Identity: A Study of two Scheduled Castes in Haryana’. at JNU, Delhi. Feeling elated, relieved and proud to share one of the biggest achievement of my life. This is the first PhD in my patriarchal and second one in my matriarchal family. The journey was full of ups and downs where it could not have been completed if I do not have support, love and confidence of my loved and closed ones. My father (the genitor of my present version) will be really happy wherever he is today. My mother lives her dreams through my eyes and always make sure to cooperate me in any situation. My nani and her head massages were a boon for my thoughts and ideas and yes the cafés especially Starbucks was my cocoon along side my room for editing my end number of drafts. I completed today a saga of learning experience in JNU for more than 10 years for being mature, being ignorant on unnecessary issues and being assertive cum patient. I thank my supervisor (DR G Srinivas) and chairperson (Prof Vivek Kumar) and each and every faculty and non teaching staff for boosting my morale, shaping my thoughts and providing me the best ever experience I can have in my Centre for the Study for the Social Systems. @sabahkhan_02 you were being missed here so much. @preeti.yadav228 thanks for supporting me always. #thesis #submission #milestone #achievement #passion #preserverance"
