Sunil Dutt (born June 6, 1929, Khurd village, Jhelum district, British India [now in Pakistan]—died May 25, 2005, Mumbai) was an Indian actor, producer, director, social activist, and politician who was especially known for his several acting roles as a dacoit (member of an armed gang of bandits). While he continued to act until the time of his death, he assumed other offscreen roles in the film industry and also became involved in politics and with various social issues.

After graduating from Jai Hind College, in Bombay (now Mumbai), Dutt took a job with a leading British advertising agency. His interest in the performing arts was stoked by his work as an announcer on Radio Ceylon’s Hindi service. There, as the host of a show, he met and interviewed a number of celebrities, including his future wife, the actress then known simply as Nargis.

Dutt debuted in Hindi cinema with Railway Platform (1955), and his first major success came six movies later with Mother India (1957). His role in that movie was that of the outlaw hero Birju, and it remains one of Bollywood’s most-memorable performances of all time. Some of Dutt’s other successes at the box office were in Ek-hi-rasta (1956; “The Only Way”), Gumrah (1963; “Astray”), Waqt (1965; “Time”), Hamraaz (1967; “Confidant”), the comedy Padosan (1968; “Neighbour”), and Reshma aur Shera (1972; “Reshma and Shera”). Dutt acted in some 100 films, produced 7, and directed 6. He made his directorial debut in 1964 with the daring, experimental one-man film, Yaadein, later known as Memories.

Also keenly interested in politics, Dutt became the sheriff of Mumbai in 1981. In 1984 he joined the Congress (I) party (so named for its descent from the Indian National Congress party and its leadership by Indira Gandhi) and was elected a member of parliament from northwest Mumbai for five terms (1984, 1989, 1991 [resigned in 1993 in protest over religious violence], 1999, and 2004). He worked actively for the cause of slum dwellers. In 2004 he was appointed India’s Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, a post he held until his death.

Dutt’s sociopolitical life was as active as his creative life. In 1981 he founded the Nargis Dutt Cancer Foundation in memory of his wife, who had succumbed to cancer that year. In 1987 Dutt led a 1,250-mile (2,000-km) peace march from Mumbai to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, to pray for peace when Sikh militancy was at its height in Punjab. In 1988, to appeal for global disarmament, he went to Japan and walked from Nagasaki to Hiroshima (both cities were targets of U.S. atomic bombs during World War II).

Among Dutt’s many awards was the Padma Shri, which he received in 1968. He twice received the Filmfare Award (named for Filmfare magazine) for best actor: in 1964, for his work in Mujhe jeene do (1963; “Cry for Life”), and in 1966, for Khandan (1965; “Aristocratic Family”). His last film—apart from a brief appearance in a 2007 film—was Munnabhai M.B.B.S. (2003; meaning, roughly, “Gangster Munna, Married, with Children”). Dutt’s son, Sanjay, also became a Bollywood actor.
