You were, are and will always be my hero. Happy birthday, Dad,\" Sanjay Dutt wrote on Twitter.\n\nHonoured with the Padma Shri in 1968 for his outstanding contribution to Arts, Sunil Dutt was one of the most popular stars of Hindi Cinema during 1950s and 1960s.\n\nHe acted in several films including the classic Mother India where he would meet his future wife, actor Nargis, which catapulted him to stardom. His other credits include Gumraah , Waqt , Humraaz , Khandaan , Milan , Reshma Aur Shera , Padosan .\n\nThe cinema icon's daughter, Congress leader Priya Dutt, shared a black-and-white photograph of her father on Instagram to mark the occasion.\n\n\"Happy birthday to the most handsome, loving, spirited gentleman I have known and I say it with pride, he is my father my hero. He raised the bar too high, they don't make them like him anymore. Love you dad and thank you for being that pillar in our lives,\" she captioned the photo.\n\nSunil Dutt also had a successful political career. A five-time MP, he contested his first election from the Indian National Congress party in 1984.
