        "text": "Amitabh Bachchan has been winning the hearts of his audience with his spectacular performance in hosting the quiz-based show, Kaun Banega Crorepati. The show, which aired for the first time in the year 2000, has been loved by television viewers, who love the interesting challenges of the show, as well as the frequent trivia that Big B often shares while chatting with the contestants. Something similar happened yet again, as Amitabh Bachchan shared another interesting anecdote from his memories.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmitabh Bachchan credits co-star, Waheeda Rehman for her special makeup hack during shooting\n\nIn the recent episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati 15, Amitabh Bachchan, while interacting with a contestant on the hot seat, delved onto the topic of makeup, in particular reference to women. The actor, who worked with Waheeda in a number of films such as Kabhie Kabhi, Reshma Aur Shera, Namak Halal among others, shared how the former used to carry a small compact case of makeup during the shooting of her films. Moreover, he also took a dig at some other actors whom he has seen in his film career, who require four people just to hold a mirror in front of them before going for a shot. In his words:\n\n“Waheeda ji has her favourite compact that she uses to do all her makeup. She keeps that little compact with her all the time. There are many such actors who keep four people just to hold their mirror because they always want a full-size mirror before going for the shot, they need to see everything, makeup, outfit, and all are perfect.”\n\nRecommended Read: Hema Malini Reminisces Shooting With Amitabh Bachchan For 'Baghban': 'I Wasn't Convinced Because...'\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen Big B credited his makeup artist of 40 years\n\nIn one of his the previous episodes of KBC 15, Big B had spoken about his own crew members, and credited them duly for making him presentable on-screen.
