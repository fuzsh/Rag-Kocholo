        "text": "By Glamsham Editorial\n\nBefore his debut film ROCKY, which went on to be a massive hit, Sanjay Dutt was seen as a child artist in the film RESHMA AUR SHERA which starred his illustrious father, the late Shri Sunil Dutt.\n\nThe 1972 film, which also starred Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna, Waheeda Rehman and Rakhee, had small Sanju baba portraying a brief role as a qawali singer. And today, after 41 years in the industry and over 150 films in his kitty the megastar has sung a qawali again in his upcoming film, ZANJEER!\n\nDutt who will be seen reprising the iconic character of Sher Khan in this re-imagined version of ZANJEER has gone all-out for the film, donning a never-seen-before look. His look as Sher Khan which was revealed some time back in the trailer has already been loved by the audiences. And now to know that he will be seen in this qawali avatar just takes our excitement around the film several notches higher!\n\nThe actor himself was extremely psyched about doing the qawali sequence in the song 'Khochey Pathan Ki Zubaan' and director Lakhia is confident that this will be one of Sanjay Dutt's most memorable performances on the big screen!\n\nAlong with Sanjay Dutt Apoorva Lakhia's tour de force ZANJEER stars an elite ensemble cast of Ram Charan Teja, Priyanka Chopra, Prakash Raj, Mahie Gill and Atul Kulkarni\n\nZANJEER produced by Reliance Entertainment, Puneet Prakash Mehra, Sumeet Prakash Mehra and Flying Turtle Films, Co - Produced by Rampage Motion Pictures, Directed by Apoorva Lakhia is all set to release on September 6, 2013."
