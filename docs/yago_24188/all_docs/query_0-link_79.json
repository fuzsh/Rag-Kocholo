        "text": "June 6, 1929 - May 25, 2005\n\nAs a youngster, he witnessed the brutal reality of the Partition. But he didn’t allow hate to discolour his view. In fact, he remained an advocate of peace all his life. He hit stardom playing the negative Birju in Mother India and set the template for the bête noire in Hindi cinema. He then risked his own life and rescued Nargis from the fire on the set of the film. Later, he married her not because she was a superstar but because she was a super person. He put everything on hold to nurse her when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Though emotionally broken, he played saviour to son Sanjay Dutt when his drug addiction was discovered after Nargis' passing away. He braved the trials and the incarceration that Sanjay underwent in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case with stoic strength. 58 Pali Hill, the home of the Dutts, was indeed privy to several heartbreaking moments through the decades.\n\nYet, Sunil Dutt was not someone who could be consumed by his own tragedies. His desire to contribute to the larger good couldn’t be stymied by his own despair. Helping NGOs for AIDS campaigns, betterment of slum-dwellers and sex-workers, reaching out to the jawans and riot victims, his allegiance towards the people was way bigger than his politics. He may have acted in over 100 films, but the lives he touched as a human being defy count. Remembering the man, the messiah…\n\nPartition\n\nBorn on June 6, 1928 in a Punjabi zamindar family in Khurd, on the banks of the Jhelum, Balraj Dutt (later Sunil Dutt) spent his childhood in Pakistan. He lost his father, Diwan Raghunath Dutt, at the age of five. When he was 18, the Partition (1947) unleashed Hindu-Muslim violence across the country. His father’s Muslim friend, Yakub, escorted the family to safety. Dutt and his family relocated to Mandauli, Haryana on the bank of Yamuna. Despite witnessing the wrath of the Partition, Dutt carried no angst. He lived by his mother, Kulwantidevi Dutt’s words, “Leave your past behind. If you keep wallowing in the ravages of the Partition, you will only intensify the hatred inside you.”\n\nChequered career\n\nHe moved to Mumbai in the early ’50s, joined Jai Hind College and took up a job at the BEST transport division to survive. He lived in a small room in South Mumbai which he shared with eight people including tailors and barbers. Feeling stuffy, they’d sleep on the pavement at night bang outside an Irani restaurant. “It would open at 5.30 am and that was our wake-up call,” recalled Dutt in an interview adding that tea from the café kick-started his day. His participation in college dramatics got him an opportunity to host the show, Lipton Ki Mehfil on Radio Ceylon, where he interviewed film personalities. While covering the Dilip Kumar starrer Shikast (1953), Dutt met director Ramesh Saigal, who impressed by his demeanour, offered him a role. Dutt declined the offer as he had promised his mother that he’d first complete his education. Eventually, he went on to do his first film Railway Platform (1955) with Saigal. But he shot to stardom with Mother India (1957), where he played Nargis’ rebellious son.\n\nDutt’s career peaked between the late 1950s and 1960s with hits like Sadhna, Sujata, Khandan and Padosan. In the ’60s, he scored a hat-trick with B.R.Chopra with Gumrah, Waqt and Hamraaz. Dutt then went on to launch his production house, Ajanta Arts. His first film was the bandit drama, Mujhe Jeene Do (1963), which spoke of crime and redemption. His directorial debut, Yaadein (1964), featured him as the only actor. It entered the Guinness Book of World Records for its unique premise. He directed and starred in Reshma Aur Shera (1971), which failed commercially but won the National Award. Commercial hits like Heera, Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye, Nagin and Jaani Dushman in the ’70s stoked his popularity further. If Rocky (1981) was his launch pad for son Sanjay Dutt, his directorials, Dard Ka Rishta (1982) on cancer relief and Yeh Aag Kab Bujhegi (1991) damning dowry, affirmed his societal concerns.\n\nYash Chopra’s Parampara and J.P. Dutta’s Kshatriya were among\n\nhis last few outings in\n\nthe ‘90s. Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (2003) with son Sanjay Dutt remains a watershed moment for the father-son and marked their evolving bond.\n\nSuper husband\n\nDutt saw superstar Nargis for the first time at the premiere of Bimal Roy’s Do Bigha Zameen (1953). Few years later, when he rescued her from the fire on the set of Mehboob Khan’s Mother India (1957), it won him respect from the leading lady, which later turned into love. As they were playing mother-son on screen in Mother India, the much-in-love actors maintained a low profile. On March 11, 1958, they reportedly got married in a secret Arya Samaj ceremony and didn’t make the news public for a year. They went on to have three children - Namrata, Sanjay and Priya. Asked if he was ever perturbed by Nargis’ alleged relationship with Raj Kapoor, Dutt was quoted saying, “I wasn’t concerned about her past… I’m concerned about the person who comes in my life; what matters from that day on\n\nis how true the person\n\nis to me.”\n\nWhat endeared Nargis to him was her caring nature. It’s said when his sister Rani fell ill, Nargis took her to a doctor and got her operated without bothering an already troubled Sunil.\n\nNargis and he formed the Ajanta Arts Cultural Troupe, which undertook social initiatives including holding shows for jawans.\n\nNargis suddenly fell ill in 1979, while in Delhi for her Rajya Sabha session. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, she was admitted to the Sloane Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “Dad would feed mom, clean her, help her brush her teeth. He never shared his feelings with us. But sometimes I’d hear him sobbing in his room,” recalled daughter Namrata Dutt in an interview with Filmfare. After an excruciating period in New York, a frail Nargis was brought home.\n\nSanjay’s debut film, Rocky, was to release on May 7, 1981. She expressed a wish to see the film. Arrangements for an ambulance and a wheelchair were made to take Nargis to the auditorium. But she passed away on May 3, 1981. A seat was kept vacant between father and son at the premiere of Rocky in her memory.\n\nSuper Father\n\nSanjay was a born rebel. “As a little boy, he’d pick up my father’s stubs and take puffs,” recalled Namrata in Filmfare. Between an indulgent mother and a disciplinarian father, Sanjay was packed off to boarding school in Sanawar, an experience that was initially traumatic for him. “During his teens, he lost interest in academics. He got into bad company and started smoking marijuana,” shared Namrata.\n\nAfter Nargis’ demise, Dutt had to contend with his son’s drug addiction. “I spent three-and-a-half years to get him out. He was put in rehab in Germany and Mumbai but nothing worked. I took him to America, I took him everywhere for treatment. When he was clean, I told him, ‘You’re on your own now… find yourself a job.” Dutt once shared in an interview. While Sanjay got a grip over his career, the Dutts endured a series of calamities including Sanjay’s first wife Richa Sharma’s terminal illness and his own arrest under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA) in April 1993. Even though Sanjay got bail, the fear of conviction and incarceration under the Arms Act played heavily on Dutt’s mind right till his last breath.\n\nLoved lawmaker\n\nPersonal tragedies couldn’t distract Dutt from working for the less privileged. After Nargis’ demise, he formed The Nargis Dutt Foundation for cancer patients. Whether it was the China war in 1962 or the Kargil war in 1999, he visited the borders to boost the morale of soldiers. For the Hands Across the Borders mission, he drove through India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal to promote peace. In 1987, he undertook a padyatra from Mumbai to the Golden Temple in Amritsar to pray for peace. Just as in 1988, he went from Nagasaki to Hiroshima in Japan to protest against nuclear weapons. “The money we spend on weapons can be used to provide water, to educate, for medical aid and employment,” he once said.\n\nDutt’s foray into public life began when he became Sheriff of Mumbai in 1981. In 1984 he was elected on a Congress ticket to the Lok Sabha. For an MP, who was sent to Parliament five times, his commitment to social issues superseded his desire for a post. He resigned as MP in protest against the communal riots in Mumbai in 1993. “My concept of secularism is to be a good human being, who respects all religions,” he once said. He even led a protest against the Congress government for its neglect of slum dwellers in 1985. Sunil Dutt passed away on May 25, 2005. He was the Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports in the Union Government then. His end came barely a month away from his 75th birthday. He died in his sleep due to a heart attack and perhaps heartbreak too… Yet, it was a well-played platinum innings."
