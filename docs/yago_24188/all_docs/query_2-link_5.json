He approached Sunil Dutt's wife Nargis who decided to give him a chance and suggested his name to her husband.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan had a 15 page dialogue that he kept practicing on the sets. But during rehearsals, Amitabh kept mugging up his lines and forgetting a lot of words. That is when Sunil Dutt decided to scrap Amitabh's dialogues and make his character mute.\n\nAfter the film flopped, Sunil Dutt had to pawn his bungalow and sell all his luxurious cars. Sunil Dutt was seen taking the bus to several studios at one point .it was when Sunil signed several dacoit films that he was able to pull himself out of severe debt.\n\nIn 2019 Amitabh Bachchan reveled in KBC that while shy for the film in Rajasthan.He observed that people in that region didn't knew what is rain."
