        "text": "By Kavita Chhibber\n\nmothers older sister Saroj was married to Sunil Dutts first cousin and so growing up I heard stories of Sunil Dutt and his wife actress par excellence Nargis visiting Uncle and aunty in Delhi. My uncle Tilak Raj Dutt would tell me how Sunil Dutt sahib whose real name was Balraj was from a family that was a victim of partition. A bright student, his admission to college and his tuition fees were all due to the kindness of strangers. Perhaps he learnt to give so much of himself and what he had, a result of the blessings he received. His sister-in-law Satya Dutt told me of meeting him as a young handsome 20 year old soon after she married his cousin Mulk Raj Dutt, and how loving and respectful he was. Sunil Dutt attained great success as a radio announcer and his charm, good looks, and access to the film industry brought him to the silver screen. His first film was  Railway Platform, and he never looked back after that. Mother India catapulted him to stardom. My uncle Tilak Raj Dutt said  I knew he had a crush on Nargis because when I asked him one day, Balraj, is there any actress who is pretty, he replied, they are all okay, but the one exception is Nargis. Satya aunty mentioned that they fell in love on the sets of Mother India when he saved her from a raging fire which went out of control while shooting, and in spite of his own injuries nursed her in the hospital. Satya aunty said Sunil Dutt saw a generous and home-loving woman in Nargis-a feeling that was reinforced when she quietly took his ailing sister and had her operated upon, taking care of her when Sunil Dutt hardly knew her and she was an established actress.  They grew closer and when he proposed to her, she actually called his sister and said yes.\n\nThe larger than life Nargis according to my aunt Saroj was a petite and charming woman in real life. She was exceedingly humble and would touch my feet even though I was younger than her in age but older as far as the official relationship went, being the wife of Sunils older brother, recalled Saroj aunty. Sunjay their son and their daughters Namrata and Priya would accompany them. Sunjay finally became an actor and made his debut in his fathers production Rocky. My aunt would proudly say,  Im not surprised-Sunju always was a fair and handsome child.\n\nMany years later when I met Sunjay, he told me that his father was the disciplinarian and his mom spoilt him shamelessly. Satya aunty agreed.  Nargis would go to Sanawar, the boarding school Sunjay was in and fight with the teachers if they dared to complain about Sunju. Her death left him devastated as did the rest of the family. Sunil was besides himself with grief, but he immediately quit smoking and drinking and started taking care of his health. He told me Now I have to take care of my children. Nargis had battled cancer for many months, and against all odds had come out of a coma to return home after being treated at Sloane Kettering Hospital. Her lifes dream, to see her son make his film debut and get on a horse as a bridegroom remained unfulfilled as she passed away days before Rocky was released.\n\nSunil Dutt bore his grief with dignity and never remarried. He also stood by his son as Sunjay battled drug addiction and grief over his mothers death. I finally met Sunil Dutt a few years ago as he visited Atlanta to help start a chapter of the Nargis Dutt Foundation which helps cancer victims. He was then and till the day he died, a tall handsome figure. His steady gaze, his dignity and humility impacted everyone in that banquet hall. He personally came to each table to thank the people who had come for the event and contributed to the start of the chapter or helped raise funding.\n\nIn spite of little sleep and fatigue, the moment he found out that I was his cousins niece he asked me to sit at his table, asked about uncle and aunt and agreed to do an impromptu interview reminiscing about his wife and how it was her dying wish that cancer patients in India receive the same medical care in India that she had been fortunate to receive abroad. In the past two decades, his efforts netted medical equipment worth millions of dollars, for different hospitals in India. The chapter in UK donated about $16,000 to Imran Khans cancer hospital in Lahore and helped Imran raise 100,000 pounds sterling at a fund-raising dinner in Birmingham. Sunil Dutt also helped raise three million shillings for a cancer hospital in Kenya. Since his wifes death his focus shifted from films to social causes. He immersed himself in social work and after joining politics did a lot for slum dwellers. He brought the same dedication and integrity to anything he did. When Sunjay was embroiled in the legal battle under TADA for possession of illegal guns, Sunil Dutt put aside his political career to stand by his son.  Sunju had a total soft corner for his father,  said Satya aunty.  One day very quietly he bought a brand new car and placed it outside his fathers door. I remember spending time with Sunjay in Atlanta and then flying to Chicago to hang out with my older cousin, Satya auntys son Kamal and Sunjay.. After the Wanted Alive show he told us please tell dad I did well in the show. Sunjay has a reputation of being a drinker and Kamal said to Sunil Dutt-Sunjay did well and didnt touch a drop, Sunil Dutt retorted with a laugh in Punjabi That is because he knows his father will be getting a report next day.\n\nSunil Dutt was to visit Satya aunty and family this week in Chicago to celebrate his birthday on June 6th. Kamal spoke to him 3-4 days before his death, and he was a bit under the weather. He had been out of town and the heat had been intense and he sounded tired, says Satya aunty. I think he had such a strong will that he thought nothing of it. Little were we to know... Her voice trails off in disbelief.\n\nSunil Dutt died in his sleep on May 25th. His films and his life, his humanitarian work and his integrity have left a deep impact on everyone who knew him or knew of him. Amitabh Bachchan recalls in an interview that It was actually Nargisji and Dutt Saab who were instrumental in getting me to Mumbai to try my luck in films. They treated me like a member of the family. Dutt Saab was the epitome of generosity and kindness. And to a newcomer, these are qualities that go a long way in instilling much-needed self-confidence.\n\n\"When Dutt Saab cast me in his Reshma Aur Shera, Raakheeji and I were both newcomers. I cant forget that we were given absolutely equal treatment to the big stars on location in the Rajasthan deserts. I guess somewhere those values have remained with me. Today Sanju and his sisters have a father and brother in me and Abhishek. And thats the bond we share unconditionally.\n\nFrom a refugee to a superstar, to a dedicated humanitarian Sunil Dutt will be deeply missed by everyone whose life he touched directly and indirectly. I will forever carry the image of a tall handsome man with the kindest eyes and warm smile who sat down and shared memories of his life with me and then remembered to write to me from India appreciating the time he spent talking to me. I still have that letter and the words still warm my heart to this day."
