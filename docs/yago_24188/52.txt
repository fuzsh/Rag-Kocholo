Sunil Dutt, the Bollywood actor turned government minister, has died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 74. Scheduled for next week, his funeral is expected to be a star-studded affair that brings together the leading lights of Indian cinema and politics.

A mainstay of his nation's film industry, Dutt acted in 102 films and directed six others, including the acclaimed Reshma Aur Shera. But, following the death of his wife, Bollywood star Nardis, in 1981, Dutt began increasingly to direct his energies into politics.

Dutt was first elected as an MP in 1984 and was last year appointed as India's union minister for sports and youthful affairs. He made his last screen appearance in the 2003 blockbuster Munnabhai MBBS, starring opposite his son, Sanjay Dutt.
