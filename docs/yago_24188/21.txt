Reshma Aur Shera is a classic Indian film that was released in 1971. It is a love story that takes place in the rustic settings of Rajasthan. The film is directed by Sunil Dutt and stars Waheeda Rehman, Sunil Dutt, and Rakhee Gulzar in lead roles. The film is about two childhood friends, Reshma and Shera who are deeply in love with each other but are separated by their families who belong to rival clans. The movie is set against the backdrop of a violent feud between the two clans, in which Reshma's brother is killed by Shera's father, and Shera's brother is killed by Reshma's uncle.

Despite the hostile atmosphere, Reshma and Shera continue to meet secretly and pledge their love for each other. However, their love does not go down well with their respective families, who are determined to keep them apart. The two lovers have to go through many obstacles to unite, including a forced marriage of Reshma to another man.

The film has many elements that make it a noteworthy and enjoyable watch. Firstly, the beautiful depiction of Rajasthani culture and traditions is awe-inspiring. The spectacular landscapes, traditional music, and colorful costumes add an authentic touch to the film, making it a visual treat for the audience.

In addition, the performances by the lead actors are noteworthy. Waheeda Rehman's portrayal of Reshma, a strong and independent woman who stands by her love, is commendable. Sunil Dutt's acting as Shera, a person torn apart by the love for his family and his love for Reshma, is also noteworthy. His character is nuanced and multi-layered, making it one of his best performances to date.

Moreover, Rakhee Gulzar's performance as Chhoti, Shera's sister, is another highlight of the film. Her character provides comic relief in the otherwise tense atmosphere of the film. Her dialogue delivery and expressions are impeccable, which makes her character more realistic and relatable.

The music of Reshma Aur Shera is another highlight. The music by Jaidev complements the film's dramatic storytelling perfectly. The lyrics of songs like 'Holi Re', 'Bhawre Ki Gunjan Hai Mera Dil', and 'Kesariya Balam' are an excellent blend of Indian classical and folk music. Each song has a unique melody and captures the emotions of the movie's characters exceptionally well.

Overall, Reshma Aur Shera is an excellent film that tells a heartwarming love story. The movie's depiction of the rich Rajasthani culture, coupled with the excellent performances by the actors and the music, makes it a classic film that is worth watching. The themes of love, sacrifice, and the clash between tradition and modernity make Reshma Aur Shera a timeless classic that will continue to be relevant for generations to come.
