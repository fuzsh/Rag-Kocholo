You can see weather information for yesterday or the weather history of the last years. The weather archive diagrams is separated in 3 charts:\n\nTemperature, including relative humidity in hourly intervals\n\nClouds (grey background) and clear sky (light blue background). The darker the grey background, the more dense is the cloud cover\n\nWind speed and direction (in degree 0째 = North, 90째 = East, 180째 = South and 270째 = West). In the history archive meteogram, the green line represents wind speed, and the wind rose shows the wind direction.\n\nPlease consider the following:\n\nThe weather archive shows simulation data, not measured data, for the selected area.\n\nThe data is not compared to measured data of a weather station (because in more than 99% of the places on Earth, no measurements are available). Simulation data with high predictability can replace measurements. For areas or data with lower predictability, simulation cannot replace measurements and can also not be used as an evidence.\n\nWind and temperature data are calculated with the average altitude of the grid cell. Therefore, the temperatures for mountains and coasts can be a somewhat different from the data at the exact location which you have selected. You can find the altitude of the grid cell besides the coordinates.\n\nThe \"15-day\" diagram shows hourly data. For one month, there are daily aggregations for minimum, maximum and average values. For more than 6 months there are monthly aggregations.\n\nWe also offer raw data for sale. Please contact us for more information ([email protected])"
