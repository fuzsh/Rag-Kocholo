The highest chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 80% on July 14.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is July 1, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 23% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on July 14, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 80%, while on December 4, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 90%.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Silapathar, the chance of a wet day over the course of July is very rapidly decreasing, starting the month at 88% and ending it at 79%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 88% on July 2, and its lowest chance is 4% on December 18.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during July in Silapathar is rapidly decreasing, starting the month at 17.3 inches, when it rarely exceeds 24.6 inches or falls below 11.1 inches, and ending the month at 15.4 inches, when it rarely exceeds 21.7 inches or falls below 9.8 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 17.4 inches on July 5.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of July in Silapathar, the length of the day is gradually decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 25 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 49 seconds, and weekly decrease of 5 minutes, 44 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is July 31, with 13 hours, 27 minutes of daylight and the longest day is July 1, with 13 hours, 51 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Silapathar is 4:19 AM on July 1 and the latest sunrise is 15 minutes later at 4:33 AM on July 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 6:10 PM on July 2 and the earliest sunset is 10 minutes earlier at 6:00 PM on July 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in Silapathar during 2024.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:16 AM and sets 13 hours, 53 minutes later, at 6:09 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 5:57 AM and sets 10 hours, 24 minutes later, at 4:21 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Silapathar is essentially constant during July, remaining around 100% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on June 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 100% of the time, while on January 9, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Silapathar is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 3.1 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 14, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 3.4 miles per hour, while on August 22, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 2.8 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during July is 3.3 miles per hour on July 8.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Silapathar throughout July is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 48% on July 8.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Silapathar are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in Silapathar\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Silapathar are very rapidly increasing during July, increasing by 947Â°F, from 3,866Â°F to 4,813Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Silapathar is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.1 kWh of 5.5 kWh throughout.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Silapathar are 27.594 deg latitude, 94.724 deg longitude, and 390 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Silapathar is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 82 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 382 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (2,579 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (11,037 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Silapathar is covered by cropland (100%), within 10 miles by cropland (66%) and trees (20%), and within 50 miles by cropland (43%) and trees (40%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Silapathar, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Silapathar.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Silapathar according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Silapathar is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Silapathar and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDibrugarh Airport (VEMN, 77%, 20 mi, southeast, -30 ft elevation change)\n\nLilabari Airport (VELR, 23%, 44 mi, southwest, -62 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Silapathar and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
