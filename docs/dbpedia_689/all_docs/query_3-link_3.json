Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Silapathar is essentially constant during the summer, remaining within 1% of 99% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on June 23, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 100% of the time, while on January 9, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Summer in Silapathar\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Summer in SilapatharJunJulAug0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%SpringFallJun 199%Jun 199%Aug 31100%Aug 31100%Jul 1100%Jul 1100%Aug 1100%Aug 1100%NowNowmiserablemiserableoppressiveoppressivemuggymuggyhumidhumid\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Silapathar is essentially constant during the summer, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 3.0 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 14, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 3.4 miles per hour, while on August 22, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 2.8 miles per hour.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Summer in Silapathar\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Summer in SilapatharJunJulAug0 mph0 mph1 mph1 mph2 mph2 mph3 mph3 mph4 mph4 mph5 mph5 mphSpringFallJun 13.1 mphJun 13.1 mphAug 312.8 mphAug 312.8 mphJul 13.2 mphJul 13.2 mphAug 13.0 mphAug 13.0 mphNowNow\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Silapathar throughout the summer is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 48% on July 8.\n\nWind Direction in the Summer in Silapathar\n\nWind Direction in the Summer in SilapatharNSNJunJulAug0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%SpringFallNowNowsoutheastnorthwest\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Silapathar are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Summer in Silapathar\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Summer in SilapatharJunJulAug0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%SpringFall100%Jul 17100%Jul 17NowNowcomfortablewarmhot\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Silapathar are very rapidly increasing during the summer, increasing by 2,860Â°F, from 2,939Â°F to 5,800Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Summer in Silapathar\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Summer in SilapatharJunJulAug3,000Â°F3,000Â°F3,500Â°F3,500Â°F4,000Â°F4,000Â°F4,500Â°F4,500Â°F5,000Â°F5,000Â°F5,500Â°F5,500Â°F6,000Â°F6,000Â°FSpringFallJun 12,939Â°FJun 12,939Â°FAug 315,800Â°FAug 315,800Â°FJul 13,866Â°FJul 13,866Â°FAug 14,846Â°FAug 14,846Â°FNowNow\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Silapathar is decreasing during the summer, falling by 1.1 kWh, from 6.1 kWh to 5.1 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Summer in Silapathar\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Summer in SilapatharJunJulAug0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWh8 kWh8 kWhSpringFallJun 16.1 kWhJun 16.1 kWhAug 315.1 kWhAug 315.1 kWhJul 15.4 kWhJul 15.4 kWhAug 15.6 kWhAug 15.6 kWhNowNow\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Silapathar are 27.594 deg latitude, 94.724 deg longitude, and 390 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Silapathar is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 82 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 382 feet. Within 10 miles is essentially flat (2,579 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (11,037 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Silapathar is covered by cropland (100%), within 10 miles by cropland (66%) and trees (20%), and within 50 miles by cropland (43%) and trees (40%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Silapathar, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Silapathar.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Silapathar according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Silapathar is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Silapathar and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDibrugarh Airport (VEMN, 77%, 20 mi, southeast, -30 ft elevation change)\n\nLilabari Airport (VELR, 23%, 44 mi, southwest, -62 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Silapathar and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
