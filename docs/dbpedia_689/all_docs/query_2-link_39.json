The time is calculated according to Hanafi mazhab, the method of the World Islamic League. You can change the settings and set the Shafiite mazhab and the desired method of calculation.\n\nTimely performance of prayer (salah, salat, namaz) is the religious obligation of every Muslim. Muslims are obliged to perform namaz at the prescribed time and in the exact direction of the qibla."
