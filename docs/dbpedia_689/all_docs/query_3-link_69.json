        "text": "Springtails are the one of the diverse group of apterygotes having diverse of their presence. They play very vital role in the pedo-ecosystem. The present study was carried out in the different habitats of two localities of the eastern Uttar Pradesh during January 2009 to November 2009. The aim of this research was to study the diversity of springtails. About 3090 individuals of springtails belonging to the order Collembola were collected through Aspirator and soil sampler. The study revealed that 31 species belonging to 22 genera under 6 families in order Collembola are recorded. Out of that 4 species are recorded first time from Uttar Pradesh. The study resulted more than 31% of the families of the India is in the Uttar Pradesh and the Entomobryidae was the largest family (32.26%) with highest diversity (HA=2.24) and the minimum index was HA = 0.41 of family Cyphoderidae (6.45%) were found. Whereas, family Tomoceridae (3.23%) has zero diversity index recorded. Shannon's diversity index (HA = 3.33) and Pielou evenness index (JA =0.97) indicated high springtails diversity. Margalef's richness index (Dmg = 3.73) indicated species diversity in the present study. The Jacord percent similarity index of two localities was found 64.52%."
