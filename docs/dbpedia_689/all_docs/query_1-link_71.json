        "text": "Insects fabricate the biological foundation for all terrestrial ecosystems. The current chunk of work is based on an investigation conducted in paddy fields and agricultural lands of a city of Dhemaji district, Assam which is named as Silapathar. The root behind our survey was to explore the entomological enrichment of Silapathar. During the investigation, insect samples were collected on a daily basis for a prolonged period of one month. The collection was done twice a day both during the morning and evening for 2hrs. Later collected insects were identified based on their physiological characteristics. The life cycle stages of some insects were also studied. The insect varieties which were identified in Silapathar included 8 species belonging to kingdom Animalia, phylum Arthropoda, class Insecta ; 3 species from order Orthoptera, 1 from order Hymenoptera, 4 from order Hemiptera. Among the identified insects in Silapathar were Tettigonia viridissima (Great green bush cricket), Lesser marsh grasshopper, Velarifictorus micado (Japanese burrowing cricket), Nezara viridula (Southern green stink bug), Vespa mandarinia (Asian giant harnet), Rhyparochromus vulgaris (seed bug), Leptocorisa oratorius (Rice ear bug), Oncocephalus (Assassin bug). Data let out that Silapathar is highly enriched with different types of insects and there is more to explore about this place."
