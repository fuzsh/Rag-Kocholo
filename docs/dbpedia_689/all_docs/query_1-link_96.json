        "text": "This happened during my stay at Silapathar located in Dhemaji District of Assam. A group of 6 of us planned for a short visit to this place called Likabali in West Siang District of Arunachal Pradesh. It was in December 2017, while we were on various field visits to parts of Dhemaji for a Flood Resilience Project.\n\nLikabali is a small town located in the foothills of the West Siang District of Arunachal Pradesh. I think it is not a very widely known place as I haven’t seen much visitors going there.\n\nIt is the entry point to to the state of Arunachal Pradesh from Silapathar in Dhemaji. We were travelling in a car and the road appeared hilly after crossing Jonai. Maximum time was 25-30 minutes to reach there by car.\n\nOne actually begins to feel the difference in the weather upon moving closer towards the place. As we were entering we began to feel the cold.\n\nThe sight of the place was breathtaking. There were tall trees all around the area and one could hear the sound of the water gushing downwards, piercing through the rocks. The place was hilly and there was a small iron bridge.\n\nIt is a calm and peaceful hideout for a nature lover. We stayed there for around 3 to 4 hours and returned back before getting dark.\n\nLikabali is a very beautiful place to visit and one must surely visit this amazing hideout to have a great time."
