        "text": "Archaeological site in Arunachal Pradesh, India\n\nMalinithan is an archaeological site containing the ruins of an early medieval period temple on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra River in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. It is assumed to be built by the Chutia kings in the 13th-14th century.[3][4][5][6] Kechai-Khaiti, a tribal goddess found among the Bodo-kachari groups[7][8][9][10][11][12] or the Buddhist goddess Tara[13] is considered to be the chief deity worshipped in the ruined temple. The worship of the goddess Kechaikheiti even after coming under Hindu influence was performed according to her old tribal customs.[14]\n\nThe goddess was taken care of by tribal priest known as the Deoris and was worshipped by the Borgoya khel of the Deoris.[15] There were four different kinds of Deori priest who looked after the deity Kechaikhati. The Bar Bharali and the Saru Bharali collected dues of the temple and provides animals for sacrifice. The Bar Deori (Deori Dema) and the Saru Deori (Deori Surba) performs the sacrifice and sung hymns.[16]\n\nSome scholars identify Kesaikhaiti to the Tai Khamti female deity of Nang Hoo Toungh.[17]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Malinithan archaeological site is located at the base of the Siang mountains in the Likabali town and a sub-division of the Lower Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh.[18][19] It is situated on a hill that rises to a height of 21 metres (69 ft), which affords a commanding view of the plains around it and of the Brahmaputra River.\n\nLegend\n\n[edit]\n\nA legend was implanted around the site by Srimanta Sankardev in the 16th century, connecting the place to the mythological king of Bhishmaka (Lord of Vidarbha) of the epics.[21] The association of the legend with the place led to a widespread renaming of the region.[22]\n\nAs per the mythology constructed, when Krishna wanted to marry Rukmini, the daughter of King Bhishmaka of Vidarbha, he abducted her prior to her wedding with Shishupala. Krishna and Rukmini then travelled from Bhishmakanagar to Dwarka, stopping at Malinithan on the way over, where they were guests of Shiva and Durga, who were doing penance. Parvati, Shiva's consort, warmly welcoming her guests, presented them with garlands made of flowers plucked from her orchard.[23]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom all archaeological evidences at the site, archaeologists have opined that the temple belonged to the 13th century. Stonemason marks found in Malinithan[6] were also found in other sites of Sadiya like Tamreswari temple, Bura-buri, Padum pukhuri as well as other places like Nakshaparbat and Buroi.\n\nFeatures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe archaeological excavations revealed a very well designed and carved plinth of a temple, 8 feet (2.4 m) high, with sculptures of deities and animals, designs of flowers, damaged columns and panels. Four sculptures of lions on two elephants were found at the four corners of the ruins of the temple.\n\nAmong the sculptures found at Malinthan, five notable ones carved out of granite stone are of Indra riding his mount Airavata, Kartikeya riding a peacock, Surya (Sun) riding a chariot, and Ganesha mounted over a mouse and a large Nandi bull. On the basis of the erotic Maithuna sculptures found here in different postures, it is believed that tantricism prevailed here as a fertility rite of the primitive tribal people who held the \"mother principal as the procreative power of nature\".[24]\n\nThe temple is carved entirely out of stone, a type of temple known as Asmamayai. Iron dowels discovered in the ruins of the stone temple resembles the ones found in the Tamreswari temple of Sadiya, showing that it was probably built by the same people.[25]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nMalinithan Mother goddess sculpture\n\nGaja-singha of Malinithan\n\nMalinithan Buddhist Tara sculpture\n\nMalinithan Kartika sculpture\n\nMalinithan Apsara sculpture\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
