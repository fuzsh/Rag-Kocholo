Since this region has the highest concentration of bamboo, which accounts for around 60.0% of the total bamboo of the country, Assam has ample scope for bamboo-based industries such as paper manufacturing. The objective of the Government of Assam is to promote bamboo as a substitute for wood and make it the timber of the 21st century. Assam has rich forests covering nearly a third of its land area. The forests in the state act as a reserve for commercially useful products such as timber, bamboo, stone, and cane. In the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Government of Assam announced plans to invest US$ 2.57 million for the growth of the forest sector in the state. The basic infrastructure for conserving and protecting forest and wildlife in the state has also witnessed improvements over the past years. These improvements include the maintenance and renovation of 1,435 km length of forest roads, enhancements of 458 culverts and bridges, manufacturing of 585 buildings, etc. During 2014-15, in order to protect the forest, the state government raised the 2nd Assam Forest Protection Force Battalion, headquartered at Seconee (Nagaon). There has also been an increase in the number of wild animals in the state during 2015-16. Further, there has also been an increase in the amount of ex-gratia for the loss of human lives taken by the wild animals. A new scheme will be launched to aid problems being faced due to climate change. For this purpose, high emphasis would be given on technology and forestry.

Traditional varieties of silk cultured in the state include Eri, Muga and mulberry. Muga silk, known for its fine sheen and golden colour, is used by the local silk- weaving industry, which has contributed to the development of Muga in the state. Assam enjoys global monopoly in terms of Muga silk (also known as golden silk) production. The state accounts for around 95% of global Muga production. Moreover, Assam is the country’s major Eri silk producer (accounts for 65% of the country’s Eri silk production). Raw silk production in the state during 2015-16 was recorded to be 3,325 MT whereas during 2016-17 (up to May 2016), raw silk production in the state stood at 1,137 MT.

This mission will be for a duration of 10 years and will aim at increasing eri silk production by 5 times and the Muga silk production by 10 times. By 2025, this mission aims to produce 1 million kg of Muga silk and 10 million kg of Eri Silk.
