        "text": "Chapter One: The Party\n\nThe Russian Empire was a very large state, stretching from Alaska to Wallachia and Moldavia, which was annexed to Russia in the early nineteenth century and the Danube Basin and Northern Dobruja which were annexed in the 1870s after the Russo-Ottoman War\n\ntsar alexander i (1801-1825)\n\nRussia passed by its tsar during the nineteenth century, the moderate Emperor Alexander I, who carried out reforms to modernize Russia and expand its area after his successful wars in Persia and expansion of its possessions in North America\n\nAnd to the hard-line tyrant Nicholas I, whose reign witnessed the beginning of industrialization, Russia's reaching its limits, and Russia's loss in the Crimean War, which led to revealing the extent of the backwardness that Russia suffered.\n\ntsar Nicholas i (1825-1855)\n\nand reformer and liberator Alexander II, who initiated the modernization of the Russian state and liberated large parts of the Balkans from Ottoman control\n\ntsar alexander ii ( 1855-1881)\n\nThe discovery of Alaska's resources led to the improvement of Russia's economic situation and the cancellation of its sale to the United States\n\nAnd the iron and ferocious tyrant Alexander III who accelerated Russia's industrialization to astonishing levels and also by ruthless suppression of any opposition\n\ntsar alexander iii (1881-1895)\n\nAnd the end to Nicholas II, who, despite his good intentions, the Khodynka tragedy led to the fateful beginning of his reign, which will end much sooner than anyone expected and even Nicholas II himself\n\ntsar Nicholas ii( 1895-1903)\n\nOctober 6, 1903 was a beautiful day when Prince Ernst of Hesse hosted the ancient European royal families because of the wedding day of his niece, Princess Alice of Battenberg, from Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark. Tsar Nicholas, his wife and his four daughters attended. It was a happy day because of the nature of the occasion.\n\nAfter the event was over, the Tsar went with his family to host the Princess of Hesse, who decided to spend time with the Tsar's daughters in the Polish city of Skiernice\n\nOn the morning of November 18, 1903, Nicholas woke up with a very red face and felt a sore throat and a high temperature. The Emperor's personal physician was called for help, but nevertheless, Nicholas' condition worsened even more. After many attempts to treat him, and most of them failed, the emperor seemed to think that in his last days, in his last will, he decided to succeed his brother Prince Michael in his position as Caesar and made him regent during his illness and closed his eyes for the last time.\n\nNicholas' family was around him in his bed that day and when he died they mourned him greatly, especially his wife, daughters and brothers\n\nThe Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich had by the end of this day become Emperor Mikhail II Alexandrovich Romanov, a position he tried to avoid as much as possible, but God made him return to this position\n\nTSAR MICHAEL II (1903-??)\n\nBut he decided to postpone his coronation until the twenty-fifth of November in order to complete arrangements for the funeral of Nicholas II\n\nfuneral of tsar Nicholas ii\n\nThe new emperor has a heavy task on his shoulders, which includes restoring Russia to its greatness and avoiding wars so that Russia will be in the best position possible.\n\nThe days will reveal whether Tsar Mikhail will be able to carry out the duties and goals contained in his new position\n\nWe'll see that in the next chapters\n\nThe end of the first chapter\n\nChapter Two: The Crown\n\nToday, August 5, 1904, marked a year since the death of Nicholas II, and Michael II ascended the throne. He was known to be a liberal person, unlike his very reactionary brother, but nevertheless he was such a hesitant person that this was an inappropriate adjective for the Russian emperor, and he was not one who insisted on his opinion, but even so, he was a persistent person not inclined to rule himself, so he was Tyranny is almost non-existent\n\nMikhail decided to appoint Sergei Witte as his advisor, in addition to his position as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers, in order to take advice on the best possible way to improve Russia's situation and put it on the right course of development.\n\nSergei Witte\n\nWitt's tenure as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers included important reforms and paved the way for the constitutional monarchy, which work began with the approval of the tsar, along with industrialization projects that increased their pace to the point where he was called the father of Russian industrialization, despite criticisms leveled at him for the protectionist policy that delayed the transformation of the Russian economy From a feudal economy to a modern capitalist economy.\n\nThe continued emancipation of the peasants began when Witt spoke with the emperor about it, and though the emperor hesitated greatly, fearing the wrath of the nobles and his initial objection, he agreed.\n\n“Russia will return to its glory, pride and power, and with the opening of the Great Siberian Railway, we prove that Russians can do the impossible for the greatness of the Holy Motherland.”\n\nEmperor Michael's speech at the inauguration of the Trans-Siberian Railway Project, June 1904\n\nSiberian Railway​\n\nRussia began to develop significantly economically, Russian cities were modernized and railway projects were built, especially the Trans-Siberian Railway, which was opened in June of 1904, when Emperor Michael opened it and made his first trips from Yaroslavsky Station in Moscow to the city of Vladivostok. Extension of the Siberian Railway to Alaska\n\nThe construction of projects for the Petrograd and Moscow subway began at the beginning of the reign of Mikhail, when Peter Ivanovich Balinsky and Yevgeny Karlovich Knory came to present their proposal to the Emperor regarding the idea of a train traveling within the cities of St. Petersburg and Moscow. After consulting with his advisors, he seemed to like the idea and then gave her approval for the project\n\nMetro station \"Sennaya Ploshchad\" in St. Petersburg\n\nCentral metro station on Red Square in Moscow\n\nCentral Metro Station on Vasilyevsky Spusk and Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow\n\nDuring the reign of Tsar Michael, December of 1903 was the birth of the Russo-Japanese alliance where Ito Hirobumi visited Russia as a representative of Emperor Meiji in order to implement Japan's plan to obtain Korea, but he was aware of how Japan was inferior to Russia and decided to make an offer to the Russian government where the Granting them Manchuria While Japan initially gets Korea, the emperor seemed unwilling to the idea due to conservatives with an anti-Japanese racist mindset who began trying to influence a reluctant emperor\n\nIto Hirobumi\n\nBut with some persuasion from Witte, who wanted to avoid war and was aware that Japan was a powerful country and also in order to prevent Japan from getting too close to England and bringing it into Russian influence, Emperor Michael reluctantly agreed to a power-sharing agreement. between Japan and Russia. The Japanese were very happy because of the agreement that led to their recognition as a great power and to prove that diplomacy would be an essential part of Japan's expansion, from here the Japanese-Russian relations would begin to converge.\n\nAlthough things are starting to improve in Russia, there are major problems that remain unresolved or unresolved. Despite the economic improvement, the peasants were living in abject poverty and factory workers in inhumane conditions, in addition to the massacres of minorities and Jews and the strict Russification policy that continued although the current emperor was less strict towards it than his predecessors, but one mistake by one of the Grand Dukes would To screw things up and make the people's anger boil, which is what will happen because Grand Duke Sergei will cause the monster to come out of the box\n\nGrand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich​\n\nWe will see how Tsar Mikhail will deal with his first test as Emperor of all Russia\n\nWe'll know that in the next chapters\n\nend of chapter​\n\nChapter Three: The World\n\nWarning: some of the events that we will mention will be different from what happened in reality, but their mention will be brief but enough to understand the situation in 1904\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the world witnessed many events, including the Napoleonic wars that led to the dissemination of the concepts of the French Revolution and the revolutions of 1848 that led to the occurrence of modern concepts such as nationalism, socialism, liberalism and democracy\n\nnapoleon i and 1848 revaluations\n\nThe British Empire prospered in a very big way, got its two crown jewels (China and the British Raj) China became a British colony, but slowly during the Opium War, as Britain captured Hong Kong and the coastal provinces, where Queen Victoria became Empress of India and China in 1878 and expanded within China further During the Taiping Rebellion, the Qing Empire disintegrated and large parts of China were annexed to British rule\n\nBritish china flag\n\nThe Orleans era, which ruled France from 1830 to 1870, was the beginning of the flourishing of French culture and the richness of France, as France expanded in the former Ottoman Algeria and Indochina, opened trade with Korea, but with increasing inequality, it became an Oligarchy kingdom due to industrialists and bankers who controlled behind the scenes the government\n\nAdmiral Duperré during the take-over of Algiers in 1830\n\nAnd the Orleans and the Bourbons seemed to become tyrannical like the old kings, as the Spanish glorious revolution led to a similar revolution in France after two years and they overthrew King Ferdinand Philip in 1870 because the revolation, who fled to London as a result. Despite their decision to keep the monarchy, they could not restore Bonaparte because they were no longer Catholic, despite the interest of the Dutch King louis III Napoleon Bonaparte but the idea was rejected because he was a Calvinist\n\nking louis iii of Netherlands and King Ferdinand Philip i of france\n\nFrench revaluation of 1870\n\n.After that, the French agreed to take a foreign king as the King of France. Candidates were searched for and stipulated that they be Catholic.\n\nBecause of this, the Catholic houses rushed to become a candidate for the French throne from the Bavarian house of Wittelsbach (they were claiming the throne of France from the dynasty of King James I that ruled Britain) they were rejected because of precedents The madness and depression for which the dynasty was known.\n\nThe Spanish Bourbons were simply rejected for the same reason that the Spaniards rejected the French Bourbons, and the Italian Bourbons were rejected for the same reason and also because they were the most reactionary branch of the Bourbons (even more than the French legalists themselves)\n\n. The House of Witten, the ruler of Saxony, refused to nominate the throne of France.\n\nThe house of Hohenzollern-Sigmargen was rejected, even though they were Catholics because they had obtained the throne of Spain, and no one wanted personal union.\n\nprince Leopold of Hohenzollern (king lepold i of Spain)\n\nHabsburg Lorraine was rejected because of the history of competition between France and Habsburg and being more conservative than even the Borborns made the idea impossible as they wanted a king liberal\n\nIn the end, the French government settled on Prince Amedeo of Savoy, son of the Italian King Victor Emmanuel I, who invested heavily in his son's nomination for the throne of France, as he was grateful to the country that helped him unify Italy and saw an opportunity to strengthen his dynasty in addition to the fact that the Savoy dynasty has French origins besides being a Catholic dynasty But it is very liberal and its attitude is neutral to somewhat hostile towards religion\n\nprince Amedeo of savoy (king Amedeo i of france)\n\n(where King Victor Emmanuel I died in 1900 and excommunicated by Pope Pius IX despite his many pleas, even at his deathbed to reverse the excommunication), which led to Amadeo becoming an anti-clerical along with his brother King Umberto The first is the king of Italy,\n\nWith these facts in front of Russia, the Russians must carefully select their appropriate allies\n\nWe'll see what the next alliances are\n\nto be Continued​\n\n​"
