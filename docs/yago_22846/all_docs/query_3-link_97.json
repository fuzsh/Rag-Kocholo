        "text": "Name of Czar: Peter III Feodorovich\n\nName of possible consort: MariaAnna Sophia of Saxony\n\nWhy the marriage plans foundered OTL: Empress Elizabeth wanted a less important princess for czarina in case fertility issues cropped up, so that she could send her home with little fuss.\n\nResults of a successful marriage into Russia: (note, this doesn't necessarily mean that the marriage itself is successful, simply that the tsarevich and the princess get married).: Would cement the Bourbon-Russian alliance (since her sisters would be married to the king of Naples/Spain and the dauphin of France)\n\nAs far as the results for Russia are concerned:\n\n(a) Stronger alliance with Prussia - Peter III was an admirer of the Old Fritz. In OTL Catherine II also was Prussia-oriented for quite a while but Peter was a little bit \"overdoing\" the whole thing by emphasizing personal attachment and admiration while for his widow it was just a politics. Wofe's origin and relations would be of a limited importance (unless she manages to stage a successful coup).\n\n(b) Most probably, more reforms than in Catherine's time: she was always restricted by the considerations of practicality and self-preservation while Peter seems to be more impulsive. High probability of the equality of the religions. Earlier establishment of the state bank (it took Catherine years to implement this Peter's idea). He seems to be well-intentional but not always practical.\n\n(c) Probably war with Denmark (yes, I know that Denmark was absolutely undefeatable but neither Peter nor his contemporaries were aware of this fact ).\n\n(d) Probably more or less the same as far as the wars against the Ottomans are involved (with an advantage of not having a nincompoop like Potemkin as commander-in-chief during the 2nd one).\n\n(e) Probably the same as far as the 1st Partition is involved (Fritz was advocating it) but I doubt that Poniatowski would be made a king of the PLC.\n\nI'm not sure about that. She might've married Grand Duke Andrei with Alexander III's permission, but that doesn't mean the marriage wasn't morganatic. The Romanov house laws are pretty clear that any marriage to someone from a non-royal or non-ruling family is dynastically unequal and the children thereof have no succession rights. So I'm guessing that we'd be as likely to see a Czarina Mathilda (not to mention she was Catholic, only converting to Russian Orthodoxy much later) as we would an Empress Sophie von Chotek.\n\nThe whole idea related to Mathilda is non-starter: could not happen just because it could not happen.\n\n2nd marriage of Alexander II is irrelevant: Princess Dolgorukova belonged to the top Russian aristocracy (the Rurikids): the 1st Prince of that name was founder of Moscow. In other words, they were more aristocratic than the Romanovs (at least in their \"Romanov\" line). No comparison whatsoever with a Polish ballet dancer of a humble origin.\n\nMore appropriate analogy would be marriage of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and Olga Karnovich. She ended up being recognized as a morganatic wife with a title of Princess Paley. When Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich married Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, it was in a hope that he would be removed from the line of succession. Nicholas II, who did not approve this marriage granted her title \"Countess Brasova\".\n\nno matches between Alexander II and Queen Victoria, or something like that, please.\n\nI'm sorry but have to be the exception to the rule.\n\nName of Czar: Alexander II\n\nName of possible consort: Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent\n\nWhy the marriage plans foundered OTL: In OTL she was queen of Great Britain\n\nWhat changed: In this ATL, William IV, has a son while still styled as simply Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews, with his wife, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen; their son, William, born 10 December 1820, becomes Prince of Wales on his 10th birthday (six months after his dad becomes king) and succeeds his father on 20 June 1837, becoming William V at the age of 16. In 1838–39, as a young bachelor, Alexander made the Grand Tour of Europe which was standard for young men of his class at that time. One of the purposes of the tour was to select a suitable bride for himself. He stayed for three days with the 17-19 year old king, and was introduced to the king's cousin, Alexandrine, who is one year younger than him and the two got along well.\n\nThe young King and his council agree to Alexandrine marrying Alexander, only if she accepts, that she and her descendants, are to be excluded from the line of succession, which she accepted.\n\nResults of a successful marriage into Russia:\n\nKeeping her name as Alexandrina.\n\nGiving ample amount of children, might even be able to satisfy his high sex drive.\n\nBe a wise adviser to her husband, son and grandson.\n\nAssist with reformation\n\nInspire Russian arts and literature to improve greatly\n\nHemophiliacs is sent else where\n\nBrings Russian closer to the European Table.\n\nLet me go back to Feodor III, the third Romanovs monarch.\n\nmarries\n\nName of Czar: Feodor III\n\nName of possible consort: Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark\n\nWhy the marriage plans foundered OTL: In 1675 she was betrothed to King Charles XI of Sweden. The purpose of the match, from the Swedish viewpoint, was to prevent Denmark from forming an alliance with the enemies of Sweden.\n\nHer brother, the King of Denmark, was not enthusiastic about the match, but he left the decision to her mother, who was very eager to complete it because it would give Ulrika the status of queen.\n\nMarrying him when she was 24.\n\nWhat if her brother was stronger willed, wanting to put Sweden in a difficult position and her mother, was more eager at the thought of Ulrika becoming Empress.\n\nResults of a successful marriage into Russia: Although 5 years older than him, she is apt to give him an heir.\n\nIf we have her at 21, marry him a year after his succession to the throne, at the age of 16, in 1677, that gives us, 5 years until his death in 7 May 1682, allowing for at least one issue, maximum 5, allowing his lineage to carry on, instead of being succeeded by his brothers Ivan V or Peter I.\n\nBe a wise adviser to her husband, son and grandson.Inspire Russian arts and literature to improve greatly\n\nUm...how would this work exactly? Victoria was OTL pretty (politically) naive when she first came to the throne, and this was exploited, first by Melbourne and then by Albert. I'm not sure her having a male cousin is going to change this much.\n\nAs to the arts and literature, the driving force wasn't so much Victoria IIRC. Her artistic tastes were borderline dreadful. Even her own daughter, Louise, who was of an artistic bent (sculptor) decried her mother as having no taste. An Empress Alexandrina would certainly not be fashionable - the French court (both Louis Philippe and Napoléon III's) was put in some stitches by her outfits that she wore. On one occasion where the Napoléon III was actually impressed with an outfit she was wearing and told her so, Victoria replied that it was the work of a Parisian dressmaker Eugènie had recommended.\n\nLet me go back to Feodor III, the third Romanovs monarch.\n\nmarries\n\nName of Czar: Feodor III\n\nName of possible consort: Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark\n\nWhy the marriage plans foundered OTL: In 1675 she was betrothed to King Charles XI of Sweden.

There had been a history of failed engagements with Danish suitors (Xenia Godunova to Prince Johan of Holstein, Emperor Mikhail to a Holsteiner princess, Irina Mikhailovna (Feodor's aunt) to Prince Waldemar). Usually, the marriage arrangements foundered on the shoal of religion. Russia expected that the foreigner would convert. Everyone else considered Russia as being unreasonable.\n\nOr maybe it can mean someone who just really likes staying at home? i.e. antisocial or agoraphobic?\n\nHome and homo has no links, home comes from old English ham \"dwelling place”\n\nUm...how would this work exactly? Victoria was OTL pretty (politically) naive when she first came to the throne, and this was exploited, first by Melbourne and then by Albert. I'm not sure her having a male cousin is going to change this much.\n\nAs to the arts and literature, the driving force wasn't so much Victoria IIRC. Her artistic tastes were borderline dreadful.

On one occasion where the Napoléon III was actually impressed with an outfit she was wearing and told her so, Victoria replied that it was the work of a Parisian dressmaker Eugènie had recommended.\n\nIn this alternative timeline Alexandrine is able to bring British ideas and art to Russia, she may not been seen as great by her daughters\n\nWhile a Danish match sounds interesting, would the Russians be willing to consider it?

Usually, the marriage arrangements foundered on the shoal of religion. Russia expected that the foreigner would convert. Everyone else considered Russia as being unreasonable.\n\nIt’s not asb.\n\nName of Czar: Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch (succeeded his brother Nicholas II on the latter's abdication in 1903)\n\nName of possible consort: Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria\n\nWhy the marriage plans foundered OTL: I believe that such a marriage was not imagined at the time, but the religious question would surely prevent it (Franz I wanted her to marry Crown Prince William, it might not be a problem of course)\n\nResults of a successful marriage into Russia: Elisabeth would undoubtedly be the most progressive and liberal Empress of Russia (I can imagine the Red Archduchess receiving Lenin in the winter palace for a tea hahaha). It would also bring new blood, healthy children, and most importantly, the marriage between her and Miguel could be used to start an alliance between Austria and Russia, and reduce tensions between the two countries that had opposing interests in the Balkans same scenario Olga Alexandrovna or Helena Vladimirovna could marry Franz Ferdinand maybe"
