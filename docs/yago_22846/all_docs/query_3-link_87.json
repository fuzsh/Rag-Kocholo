        "text": "Pavel just came -- told me all. I fully understand your action -- my own hero! I know you could not sign against what you swore at your coronation -- we know each other through and through and need no words - and, as I live, we shall see you back upon your throne, brought back by your people and troops to the glory of your reign.\n\nYou have saved your son’s reign and the country and your saintly purity and (Judas Ruzsky) you will be crowned by God on this earth in your country. I hold you tight, tight in my arms and will never let them touch your shining soul. I kiss, kiss, kiss and bless you and always understand you.\n\nWify.\n\n2.Freedom of speech, press, unions, assemblies and strikes, and the expansion of political liberties to all military personnel, to the extent that is allowed by wartime military conditions.\n\n3.Abolition of all class, religious and national distinctions.\n\n4.Immediate preparation for the convocation of a Representative Assembly, based on universal, equal, secret ballot and direct vote, which will determine the form of government and the constitution of the country.\n\n5.Substitution of police with popular police forces, with elected superior officers who will be subordinated to the local government.\n\n6.Elections to local government by universal, free, equal, and secret ballot vote.\n\n7.No disarmament and no withdrawal from Petrograd of military units that took part in the revolutionary movement.\n\n8.While preserving strict military discipline within army ranks and while on military duty, elimination of all restrictions for soldiers on civil rights that were granted to other citizens. The Provisional Government considers it its duty to add that it is not going to use wartime circumstances to delay the implementation of the aforementioned reforms and actions.\n\nWell, what of it! This “first stage of the first revolution (among those engendered by the war)” will not be the last, nor will it be only Russian. Of course, we shall continue to be against defence of the fatherland, against the imperialist slaughter controlled by Shingaryov + Kerensky and Co.\n\nAll our watchwords remain the same. In the last issue of Sotsial-Demokrat we actually spoke of the possibility of a government “of Milyukov and Guchkov, if not of Milyukov and Kerensky”. It turned out that it was both... and: all three together. Lovely! We shall see how the party of people’s freedom (after all, it’s in a majority in the new ministry, since Konovalov is even just a little “more Left”, while Kerensky is certainly more Left!) will give the people freedom, bread and peace.... We shall see!\n\nThe main thing now is the press and the organisation of the workers in a revolutionary Social-Democratic party.\n\nAll the best,\n\nYours, Lenin"
