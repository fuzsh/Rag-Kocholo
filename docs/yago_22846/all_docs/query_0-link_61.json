        "text": "APPENDICES:\n\nStatus of the Russian Imperial House in The Russian Federation\n\nChapter Two of the Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire: “On the Order of Succession to the Throne”\n\n25. The Imperial Throne of All the Russias is hereditary within the Imperial House presently reigning.\n\n26. Inseparable from the Imperial Throne of All the Russias are the Thrones of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Finland.\n\n27. Both sexes have the right of succession to the Throne; but this right belongs by preference to the male sex according to the principle of primogeniture; with the extinction of the last male issue, succession to the Throne passes to the female issue by right of substitution.\n\n28. Accordingly, succession to the Throne belongs in the first place to the eldest son of the reigning Emperor, and after him to all his male issue.\n\n29. With the extinction of this male issue, succession passes to the branch of the second son of the Emperor and his male issue; with the extinction of the second male’s issue, succession passes to the branch of the third son, and so forth.\n\n30. When the last male issue of the Emperor's sons is extinct, succession remains in the same branch, but in the female issue of the last reigning Emperor, as being nearest to the Throne, and therein it follows the same order, with preference to a male over the female person; but the female person from whom this right directly proceeds never loses this right.\n\n31. With the extinction of this branch the succession passes to the female issue of the branch of the eldest son of the Emperor-Progenitor, wherein the nearest relative of the last reigning Emperor in the branch of this son succeeds, the eldest in this descending line, or if unavailable, in a collateral line, and if this relative is lacking, then the male or female person who takes her place by substitution, with preference, as above, for a male over a female person.\n\n32. When these branches too are extinct, succession passes to the female issue of the other sons of the Emperor-Progenitor, following the same order, and after that to the male issue of the eldest daughter of the Emperor-Progenitor; and when that too is extinct, to her female issue, following the order established for the female issue of the Emperor's sons.\n\n33. With the extinction of the male and female issue of the eldest daughter of the Emperor-Progenitor, succession passes first to the male and then to the female issue of the second daughter of the Emperor-Progenitor, and so forth.\n\n34. A younger sister, even if she has sons, does not deprive her elder sister of her right, even if the latter is unmarried; but a younger brother succeeds before his elder sisters.\n\n35. When the succession reaches a female branch which is already reigning on another throne, it is left to the person who succeeds to make a choice of faith and throne and, together with that person's heir, to renounce the other faith and throne, if such a throne is tied by Law (with a religious denomination); if there is no renunciation of faith, the succession passes to the person next in order.\n\n36. Children born of a marriage between a person of the Imperial Family and a person not of corresponding dignity, that is not belonging to any royal or sovereign house, have no right of succession to the Throne.\n\n37. As the rules on the order of succession, enunciated above, take effect, a person who has a right to succeed is free to abdicate this right in those circumstances in which an abdication does not create any difficulty in the following succession to the Throne.\n\n38. Such an abdication, when it has been made public and becomes law, is henceforth considered irrevocable.\n\n39. An Emperor or Empress succeeding to the Throne undertakes, at accession and anointment, to solemnly observe the aforesaid laws on succession to the Throne.\n\n***\n\nThe Russian Imperial House: A Historical Survey\n\nThe Imperial House of Russia is the Romanoff Dynasty, which ruled until 1917 and was elevated to the throne by the Assembly of the Land (Zemskii Sobor) in 1613 because of its close kinship ties through the female line with the extinct Riurikovich Dynasty. The direct male line of the Romanoff Dynasty ended in 1730 (on the death of Emperor Peter II, the grandson of Peter I “the Great”). After that, the Russian Throne was occupied by Peter the Great’s niece, Empress Anna Ioannovna (ruled 1730-1740), then by her grandnephew, Emperor Ivan VI Antonovich (ruled 1740-1741), and then by Peter the Great’s daughter, Empress Elizabeth Petrovna (ruled 1741-1762). In 1761, the succession to the throne, together with all the corresponding titles and the surname “Romanoff,” passed through the female line to the House of Holstein-Gottorp (to Peter the Great’s grandson, Peter III Feodorovich, the son of Peter the Great’s daughter, Tsarevna Anna Petrovna). Emperor Paul I, the son of Peter III, issued a Decree on the Imperial Succession on April 5, 1797, which determined the order of succession to the throne, as well as membership in the Russian Imperial House. This Decree was amended on March 20, 1820, by Emperor Alexander I, who issued a Manifesto stipulating that, “if any person in the Imperial Family enters into a marriage with a person of a status unequal to His, that is, not belonging to any Royal or Ruling House, in such a case the person in the Imperial Family cannot pass on to the other person the rights which belong to Members of the Imperial Family, and the children issuing from such a marriage have no right of succession to the throne.”\n\nRussian dynastic law, which was based upon the Decree on the Imperial Succession, belongs to what is known as the Austrian system of succession, which stipulates male primogeniture. In Russia, succession passed through the female line only after the extinction of all male branches of the dynasty. Similar to the succession laws governing other monarchies, the articles pertaining to the succession to the throne (Articles 25-39 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire) are inviolable—that is, not susceptible to abolition or modification even by the Sovereign Emperor.\n\nAccording to the definition in the Encyclopedic Dictionary by Brockhaus and Efron, the Russian Imperial House is “a special institution, membership in which is enjoyed by those who may be called upon to inherit the throne according to the established laws, and by those who are married to persons who have or may come to have the right to inherit the throne.”\n\nBefore the Revolution of 1917, the Russian Imperial House of Romanoff was a unique institution: a family that had the status of a state institution, and whose members received the crown according to a prescribed order of succession. After the 1917 Revolution, the Russian Imperial House lost its political power as well as its status as a state institution, but it retained its status as a historical institution, that is—a legal entity that has enjoyed an unchallenged dynastic continuity from the moment of its ascension to the throne, and that operates then and now according to its own internal historical laws.\n\nJust like the Church’s canon laws, the dynastic laws of the Russian Imperial House continue in force to the extent that they do not conflict with the Constitution and other laws of the Russian Federation.\n\nSince the Revolution of 1917, the Russian Imperial House has lived in exile, but the order of succession to the position of Head of the Dynasty and membership in the dynasty have remained firmly governed by the statutes of Russian dynastic laws. Membership in the Russian Imperial House is governed specifically by the relevant articles of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire.\n\nAfter the abdication on March 2, 1917, of Emperor Nicholas II for himself and for his heir, Aleksei Nikolaevich, the succession passed to the Emperor’s brother, Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich. In his Manifesto of March 3, 1917, Grand Duke Mikhail delayed accepting the crown until the Constituent Assembly could meet and decide upon the future form of Russia’s government. On September 1, 1917, before the Constituent Assembly had been called, Alexander Kerensky, the prime minister of the Provisional Government, in violation of prior decrees, declared Russia a republic.\n\nIn 1918, Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich, the former Emperor Nicholas II, and the Heir and Tsesarevich Aleksei Nikolaevich, that is, the entire male line issuing from Emperor Alexander III, were executed on orders from the atheistic regime then in power. In accordance with Article 29 of the Law of Succession, the right to the throne passed to the line issuing from Alexander II: to the descendants of Grand Duke Wladimir Alexandrovich (1847-1908). The latter’s eldest son, Grand Duke Kirill Wladimirovich, declared himself in 1922 the curator of the Throne (since He was still not absolutely certain of the death of Emperor Nicholas II, his son, and brother); and on August 31, 1924, he assumed the title of Emperor-in-exile of All the Russias.\n\nThis Manifesto was fully consistent with the Fundamental Laws and was recognized by practically all Members of the House of Romanoff, and by foreign Royal Houses. One of the junior lines of the dynasty, composed of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich, and the latter’s son, Prince-of-the-Imperial-Blood Roman Petrovich, did not recognize the Manifesto of August 31, 1924—all of them believing that the question of who occupies the throne should be decided by the will of the people. The elderly Dowager Empress Maria Fedorovna, not disputing the legality of Grand Duke Kirill Wladimirovich’s action, considered his Manifesto “premature,” since she never gave up hope that one of her sons or her grandson might somehow still be alive in Russia.\n\nAt the time that Kirill Wladimirovich assumed the Imperial title, there were still 18 male Members of the Russian Imperial House living in immigration. Their order in the succession to the Throne at that time was as follows:\n\n1. The lines of descent from Emperor Alexander\n\n1. The line of Grand Duke Wladimir Alexandrovich\n\n1. Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich (son and Heir of Emperor Kirill Wladimirovich)\n\n2. Grand Duke Boris Wladimirovich\n\n3. Grand Duke Andrei Wladimirovich\n\n2. The line of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich\n\n1. Grand Duke Dmitrii Pavlovich\n\n2. The lines of descent from Emperor Nicholas I:\n\n1. The line of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich\n\n1. Prince Vsevolod Ioannovich (son of Prince Ioann Konstantinovich)\n\n2. Prince Gavriil Konstantinovich\n\n3. Prince Georgii Konstantinovich\n\n2. The line of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich the Elder\n\n1. Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich the Younger\n\n2. Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich\n\n3. Prince Roman Petrovich\n\n3. The line of Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolaevich\n\n1. Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich\n\n2. Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich\n\n3. Prince Andrei Alexandrovich\n\n4. Prince Feodor Alexandrovich\n\n5. Prince Nikita Alexandrovich\n\n6. Prince Dmitrii Alexandrovich\n\n7. Prince Rostislav Alexandrovich\n\n8. Prince Vasilii Alexandrovich\n\nGiven the fact that they were all living in exile, the majority of these members of the Imperial House did not consider themselves to be obligated to follow strictly the requirements of the Fundamental Laws. This is exemplified by the many morganatic (unequal) marriages that occurred after 1917—that is, marriages with persons who do not belong to royal or ruling houses. Grand Dukes and Princes-of-the-Imperial-Blood who had entered into morganatic marriages did not themselves lose their rights to the throne or their membership in the Dynasty, but their descendants, by virtue of Articles 36 and 188 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, possessed no dynastic rights whatsoever (neither the right to the throne, nor titles, nor even the dynastic surname “Romanoff”). Rather, a special status for the descendants of these morganatic unions was devised whereby they would be known as princes Romanovsky, along with a hyphenated surname of their choice, provided that the parents had beforehand requested permission to marry from the Head of the Dynasty (Decree of July 28, 1935). The rights to these titles as provided for in the Decree of July 28, 1935, were utilized by Grand Dukes Andrei Wladimirovich and Dmitrii Pavlovich, and by Princes-of-the-Imperial-Blood Vsevolod Ioannovich, Gavriil Konstantinovich, Dmitrii Aleksandrovich, and by the widow of Grand Duke Mikhail Aleksandrovich, Princess N. S. Brasova. The morganatic son of Grand Duke Nicholas Konstantinovich, A. N. Iskander, received the princely title without the addition of “Romanovsky” to his surname. Grand Duke Boris Wladimirovich, Prince Roman Petrovich, and the sons of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich (with the exception of Prince Dmitrii Aleksandrovich) did not seek permission to marry from the Head of the Dynasty and therefore did not receive titles for their spouses or children.\n\nEmperor Kirill Wladimirovich died on October 12, 1938. His son, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, became the Head of the Dynasty but, following the example of many other Heads of former foreign dynasties, considered it prudent not to adopt formally the title of Emperor until such time as the Monarchy in Russia should be restored. The Decree of his Father had already legally secured the continuing operation of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire in the realm of dynastic law. Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich used the official title “Head of the Russian Imperial House, His Imperial Highness, The Grand Duke,” which implied the title of Emperor de jure.\n\nGrand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, was the sole male dynast of the Imperial House to enter into an equal marriage after 1917. On August 13, 1948, he married Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna, the daughter of the Head of the Georgian Royal House, H.R.H. Prince George Alexandrovich Bagration-Mukhrani. The royal status of the House of Bagration was permanently recognized by Russia in the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 and was confirmed by the Decree of December 5, 1946, issued by the Head of the Russian Imperial House at the request of the Royal House of Spain and has been recognized by all the royal houses of Europe.\n\nFrom this marriage was born on December 23, 1953, Grand Duchess Maria Wladimirovna. Inasmuch as all other living male dynasts of the Imperial family had entered into morganatic marriages, and because their advanced age made it unlikely that any of them would enter into new and equal marriages and, even less likely, have children—the Grand Duchess became the presumptive future Heiress to the throne by virtue of the inviolable Article 30 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire. Therefore, her father, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, proclaimed her majority at 16 years of age (in accordance with Article 40), and, on December 23, 1969, issued a Decree proclaiming that, in the event of the Grand Duke’s death, the Grand Duchess was to be the Curatrix over the proper order of succession to the title of Head of the House. This Decree drew objections from certain Princes of the Blood, but its legality cannot be challenged, because it deprived no male dynasts of the Dynasty of any of their legal rights, but merely established oversight over the correct succession.\n\nAt the time that the Decree of 1969 was issued, the male line succession after Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich would have been the following:\n\n1. Prince Vsevolod Ioannovich (1914-1973). His first marriage was to Lady Mary Lygon, a British subject, who was granted the title of Princess Romanovsky-Pavlovsky (1939). His second wife was to Emilia de Gosztonyi, a Hungarian, who was granted the title of Princess Romanovsky (1956) by Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. His third wife was Valli Knust, a Dane, to whom Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich granted the title of Princess Romanovsky-Knust (1961). No children issued from any of the three marriages.\n\n2. Prince Roman Petrovich (1869-1978). His wife was Countess Praskovia Dmitrievna Sheremetev. Children born to this marriage are morganatic: and they have no rights to any dynastic titles.\n\n3. Prince Andrei Aleksandrovich (1897-1981). His first wife was Elisaveta Fabrizievna Ruffo. His second wife was Nadine McDougall of Great Britain. Children born to these marriages are morganatic and they have no rights to any dynastic titles.\n\n4. Prince Nikita Aleksandrovich (1900-1974). His wife was Countess Maria Ilarionovna Vorontsov-Dashkov. Children born to this marriage are morganatic and have no rights to any dynastic titles. The line descended from Prince Nikita has died out.\n\n5. Prince Dmitrii Aleksandrovich (1901-1980). His first wife was Countess Marina Sergievna Golenishchev-Kutuzov, who was granted the title Princess Romanovsky-Kutuzov by Emperor Kirill Wladimirovich. His second wife was Sheila Chisholm of Australia. The daughter born to the first marriage was Princess Nadezhda Romanovsky-Kutuzov. The line of descent from Prince Dmitrii has died out.\n\n6. Prince Rostislav Aleksandrovich (1902-1977). His first wife was Princess Alexandra Pavlovna Golitsyn, his second wife was Alice Baker of the United States, and his third wife was Hedwig von Chappuis of Germany. Children born of these marriages are morganatic and have no rights to any dynastic titles.\n\n7. Prince Vasilii Aleksandrovich (1907-1989). His wife was Princess Natalia Alekseevna Golitsyn. The marriage produced no male issue. Their lone child, a daughter, is morganatic and has no rights to any dynastic titles.\n\nMale dynasts of the Imperial House who died before 1969—Grand Duke Boris Wladimirovich, Grand Duke Andrei Wladimirovich, Grand Duke Dmitrii Pavlovich, Grand Duke Gavriil Konstantinovich, Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich, Prince Georgii Konstantinovich (who died unmarried), and Prince Feodor Alexandrovich—similarly left no issue who are dynasts, since all of their marriages were morganatic.\n\nWith the passing in 1989 of Vasilii Alexandrovich, the last living Prince of the Imperial Blood, which occurred during the lifetime of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, Grand Duchess Maria Wladimirovna became not only the presumed future Heiress, but in fact the actual Heiress to Her Father’s title.\n\nIn 1976, Grand Duchess Maria Wladimirovna entered into an equal marriage with Prince Franz-Wilhelm of Prussia, who, after being received into the Orthodox Church, took the name Mikhail Pavlovich and was granted the title Grand Duke by his father-in-law, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. The marriage was later dissolved by divorce; but had the marriage not ended, the position in the dynasty of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich would have been determined by Article 6 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, which provides that, if Grand Duchess Maria Wladimirovna had ascended the throne, then her husband would have the same rights of any spouse of a Russian emperor (similar to the position and rights enjoyed by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of Queen II of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.)\n\nOn March 13, 1981, a son was born of this marriage: Grand Duke George Mikhailovich. By an agreement made between Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich and Prince Louis Ferdinand, the respective Heads of the Russian and German Imperial Houses, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich’s father became a member of the Russian Imperial House, and therefore the newborn child belonged from the time of his birth to the Romanoff Dynasty and bore a Russian title.\n\nOn April 21, 1992, the Head of the Russian Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, died. With his death, the male line of the Romanoff Dynasty became extinct, similar to the situation that occurred in 1730. But unlike then, when the succession was determined by the will of one person or by a small group, the succession in 1992 was determined by a clear and precise Law of Succession. Article 30 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire indisputably assigned the headship of the Russian Imperial House to Grand Duchess Maria Wladimirovna.\n\nAt present, the Russian IMPERIAL House consists of two persons:\n\n1. The Head of the Russian Imperial House, Her Imperial Highness, Grand Duchess (de jure Empress of All the Russias) Maria Wladimirovna of Russia (born 1953).\n\n2. His Imperial Highness, the Heir, Tsesarevich, and Grand Duke Georgii Mikhailovich of Russia (born 1981).\n\nAll other descendants of Members of the Dynasty have no rights to the throne and do not belong to the Russian Imperial House (Articles 26 and 188 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire). The so-called “Romanoff Family Association,” which is now made up exclusively of morganatic descendants of Members of the Russian Imperial House and which is headed by Dmitry Romanovich “Romanoff,” the morganatic son of the Prince Roman Petrovich, is an entirely private organization and has no foundation whatsoever in the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire.\n\n***\n\nThe Russian Imperial House\n\nThe Head of the Russian Imperial House, Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess (de jure Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of all the Russias) Maria of Russia was born on December 23, 1953 (New Style) in Madrid, Spain. She is the only daughter of the late Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. The Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, and H.I.H. The Grand Duchess Leonida Georgievna (née H.R.H. Princess Bagration-Muhkranskaya of Georgia). Following the tradition of the Imperial Family, the Grand Duchess was brought up in the Orthodox Faith and instilled with a strong sense of devotion to the interests of Russia.\n\nBecause her father was the only male dynast of the Imperial House to contract an equal marriage after 1917, it became highly likely that the young Grand Duchess would in due course become the heiress to the Russian throne. Because of this, Her Father, the Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, determined that she had reached her dynastic majority at the age of 16 (Article 40 Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire), and on December 23, 1969, the Grand Duchess swore the required dynastic oath of allegiance to her country and to her august father. On the same day, the Head of the Russian Imperial House issued a Decree proclaiming that, should he die prior to the deaths of the several then-living Princes of the Imperial Blood who had entered into morganatic marriages, the Grand Duchess Maria would become the Curatrix of the Imperial Throne.\n\nOn September 22, 1976, the Grand Duchess contracted an equal marriage with H.R.H. Prince Franz-Wilhelm of Prussia. Since the Grand Duchess would eventually be the Head of the Romanoff Dynasty, a dynastic agreement was entered into and legally formulated between the Russian Imperial House and the Prussian Royal House prior to the wedding, according to which Prince Franz-Wilhelm converted to the Orthodox Faith and became a member of the Russian Imperial House with the name Mikhail Pavlovich and the title of Grand Duke. He also promised that any issue from this marriage would be brought up in the Orthodox Faith. The status of Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich was determined by the provisions of Article 6 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire.\n\nIn any event, the Decree of 1969 was never put into effect. In 1989, Prince of the Imperial Blood Vasilii Alexandrovich (Prince Vasilii of Russia) died, leaving the Head of the Imperial House, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich, as the only surviving male dynast in the dynasty. From that point on, the Grand Duchess became first in line after Her Father.\n\nGrand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich was the last male dynast in the male line of the Romanoff Dynasty. At his death and in accordance with Article 30 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, the succession passed to the female line in the person of his daughter. The Grand Duchess thus became the Head of the Russian Imperial Dynasty (and de jure Empress of all the Russias).\n\nHer Imperial Highness studied at Oxford University. In addition to Russian, the Grand Duchess is fluent in English, French, and Spanish. She also speaks and reads German, Italian and Arabic. Her first visit to Russia was in April 1992 to attend the funeral of her father, Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich in St. Petersburg. Since that time, Her Imperial Highness has made numerous trips to Russia, carrying on the duties of her father and attempting to help her fellow countrymen in this difficult transitional period. In her speeches she constantly emphasizes that she is ready to answer the call from the people, but that under no circumstances does she wish Monarchy to be imposed on the Russian people against their will.\n\nLike her father and grandfather, Grand Duchess Maria of Russia loyally and steadfastly discharges the many duties entrusted to her by God, completely dedicating her life to her beloved homeland.\n\nIn his congratulatory message to Grand Duchess Maria of Russia on her 50th birthday, His Holiness Patriarch Alexis II of Moscow and All Russia characterized her as a “faithful and ardent servant of the Lord God,” adding: “I would like to express to you my profound recognition and gratitude for your tireless and active participation in the fate of the Russian State, in its fundamental moral and social rebirth, and in all its sorrows and joys. It is especially pleasing to see your sincere devotion to Holy Orthodoxy…. It is obvious to all who know you that in your private life, you are guided by the best traditions which are exemplified in the life of the Holy Righteous Princess Olga.”\n\nIn 2003, Patriarch Alexis II awarded the Head of the Russian Imperial House the Church’s Order of St. Olga I Class, and in 2004, the Grand Duchess awarded the highest dynastic award—the Imperial Order of St. Andrew the First-Called—to His Holiness.\n\nSimilarly, in his congratulatory message on Her Imperial Highness’s 55th birthday, Patriarch Kirill noted that “you are the embodiment of a Russian Grand Duchess: noble, wise, compassionate, and consumed with a genuine love for Russia. Though you may reside far from Russia, you continue to take an active part in its life, rejoicing when there are triumphs and empathizing when there are trials. It is deeply gratifying to know that, even in these new historical circumstances, you are making a significant contribution to the building of Russia’s global standing on the basis of spiritual and moral values, and the centuries-old traditions of the Russian people. The Russian Orthodox Church remains the preserver of the historical memory of the Russian people, and supports, as it has traditionally, the warmest possible relations with the Russian Imperial House.”\n\n***\n\nHis Imperial Highness the Heir, Tsesarevich, and Grand Duke George of Russia was born on March 13, 1981 (New Style) in Madrid, on the eve of the 100th Anniversary of the martyrdom of his great-great-grandfather, Emperor Alexander II the Tsar-Liberator (on March 1/14, 1881). He is the son of H.I.H. Grand Duchess Maria of Russia and H.I.H. Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich.\n\nThe Grand Duke was baptized before the miracle-working Kursk Root Icon of the Mother of God, in the Orthodox Church in Madrid. Present at the baptism were King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sophia of Spain, and King Simeon II and Queen Margarita of Bulgaria. His godfather was King Constantine II of Greece.\n\nThe early childhood of the Tsesarevich was spent in St.-Briac, France, and then in Paris. Up until 1999, the Heir and his mother lived principally in Madrid, where he completed college. From the time of his early childhood, the Grand Duke was educated in the spirit of the Orthodox Faith and in the full awareness of his duties to his homeland.\n\nThe Tsesarevich first visited Russia in April 1992, when the entire Imperial Family attended the funeral of Grand Duke Wladimir Kirillovich. Since then he has been many times to Russia, always showing a lively interest in all aspects of the life of the people.\n\nRussia’s ancient Orthodox churches, and what he considers their uniquely prayerful atmosphere, have made an indelible impression on the Grand Duke. He also takes special interest and great pleasure in visiting military bases and in meeting and conversing with soldiers, sailors and officers of the Russian army and navy.\n\nThe Tsesarevich plays a variety of sports and is an excellent marksman. Besides Russian, in which he always received excellent grades, the Grand Duke has studied and speaks English, French, and Spanish. He knows, and participates in, the order of services of the Orthodox Church.\n\nOn April 9, 1997, during a pilgrimage of the Imperial Family to the Holy Land, the Heir, Tsesarevich, and Grand Duke George of Russia, pursuant to the Russian Fundamental Laws, took his dynastic oath to his country and to his most august mother. The ceremony took place in Jerusalem, in the Throne Room of the Patriarch’s residence, and was witnessed by the faithful guardian of the purity of Orthodoxy, Patriarch Diodoros of Jerusalem. The Patriarch gave his blessing to the Grand Duke and offered his prayers that the Grand Duke will defend the Orthodox Faith, serve Russia and her people, and inviolably preserve the laws of the Russian Imperial House.\n\nAfter studying at Oxford University, and wanting to study the political, economic, and social processes that were determining the future course of Europe, His Imperial Highness began working for the European Parliament, and then moved to the position of assistant to the vice-president of the European Commission and Commissioner for Transport and Energy, Loyola de Palacio, in Brussels. Later he continued working for the European Commission in Luxembourg, in the European Commission for Atomic Energy and Security. During these years, the Grand Duke visited Russia several times on business.\n\nIn 2006, he made his first official visit to Russia. He traveled to Russia at the request of his mother, the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. The Grand Duchess Maria of Russia, to congratulate His Holiness, Patriarch Aleksei II of Moscow and All Russia, on the 45th anniversary of his ordination to the episcopacy. During that visit, the Grand Duke also met with the First Deputy Chairmen of the Duma, Oleg Morozov and Liubov Sliskaia, as well as with the chairs of several Duma committees and other Duma deputies.\n\nDuring another visit to Russia in November 2008, the Grand Duke accepted a job offer from the management of Norilsk Nickel; and in December, the Grand Duke assumed the position of special advisor to the company’s Director, V. I. Strzhalkovskii. In this new position, His Imperial Highness represented the interests of Norilsk Nickel—one of Russia’s largest companies—in the European Union. In addition, Grand Duke George of Russia took a seat on the Board of the Nickel Institute.\n\nAfter having gained significant experience advancing the interests of Russian industry, and his employment contract with Norilsk Nickel having expired, Grand Duke George of Russia formed his own public relations consulting firm—Romanoff & Partners—in Brussels. The agency represents Russian and East European companies in the European Union.\n\nGrand Duke George of Russia is entirely convinced that for him there is no obstacle to exploring a variety of professions and business activities. “My ancestor, Peter the Great,” he stated, “bequeathed to future generations of the Imperial House a wonderful example of respect for work. He scorned no form of employment and he was interested in everything. One can and should do what one does best and what benefits others, without regrets or stigma. Being a member of the Imperial House does not grant one privileges. It rather imposes great responsibilities: that neither your ancestors nor descendants should ever be ashamed of you, and that the dynasty’s good name should never be tarnished.”\n\nIn addition to his business ventures, Grand Duke George of Russia of course performs his duties as Heir to the Head of the Russian Imperial House. Regularly visiting the Russian Federation and other countries that were once part of the former Russian Empire (with his mother and by himself), the Tsesarevich works to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of these nations, and to contribute to a range of charitable and cultural projects.\n\nIn 2013—the year of the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the House of Romanoff—the Grand Duke established in London the Russian Imperial Foundation for Cancer Research.\n\nConcerning his vision of the role of the Imperial House in the modern world, His Imperial Highness has said, “Our main responsibility is to preserve the continuity in our history. Compared with this mission, even our role in government pales in significance. Our ancestors never sought after power, even at the time of the foundation of the dynasty. When emissaries from the Assembly of the Land came in 1613 to Mikhail Feodorovich to announce that he was the heir to the throne, he was filled with terror at the very thought of it and for a long time refused it.\n\n“The throne is a responsibility—a very weighty responsibility. If it is asked of us to assume the throne, we will accept this responsibility without hesitation. We are prepared to respond to a summons from the people of Russia, should they want someday to restore the monarchy. But we do not seek power, nor do we make any claims to it—neither to any sort of political rights nor properties.\n\n“To maintain a living connection to modern Russia and to its thousand-year-long history—that is our duty and our unending responsibility, regardless of what form of government may happen to be in power.”\n\n***\n\nDecree № 998 of December 21, 2011, of the President of the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova: “Concerning the Status of the Russian Imperial House in the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova”\n\nIn accordance with Article 72 of the Constitution of the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova, and honoring the memory of our ancestors who have conveyed to us a love for our Fatherland, and confirming the integral place of the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova in all periods of the centuries-long history of the All-Russian State,\n\nI hereby:\n\n1. determine herewith the status of the Russian Imperial House in the Transnistrian Republic of Moldova (see attached Appendix).\n\n2. affirm that this Decree will take full effect upon signing.\n\nPresident I.
