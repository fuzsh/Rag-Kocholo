        "text": "Nigel Waldron/ Getty Images\n\nSeveral readers have contacted me recently with information about the diamond fringe earrings worn by Crown Princess Mary of Denmark at the recent birthday celebrations in Norway. Turns out Mary’s been shopping the auction catalogues again!\n\nBruun Rasmussen\n\nThe earrings were featured in an auction at Bruun Rasmussen held in December 2016. They were lot #545 in the auction, described in the catalogue as: “A pair of diamond ear pendants each set with\n\nnumerous brilliant-cut diamonds weighing a total of app. 9.50 ct., mounted in 18k white gold.”\n\nJON OLAV NESVOLD/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe jewels may have been sold at auction, but they’re not antique; the catalogue notes state that they were made ca. 2010. The auction estimate on the earrings was approximately between $2200 and $3000.\n\nHAAKON MOSVOLD LARSEN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThese earrings are only Mary’s most recent purchase from Bruun Rasmussen’s auction offerings. The most notable item she’s bought so far is her Edwardian Tiara, also worn at the recent birthday celebrations in Norway.\n\nTristan Fewings/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York and her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, attended the Fashion for Relief event in Cannes on Sunday, and both of them wore intriguing statement jewels.\n\nAntony Jones/Getty Images\n\nBeatrice, who is usually jewelry-shy, wore a golden cuff bracelet on her left wrist for the event. The bracelet coordinates with the golden embroidery on her skirt. (Her clutch bag is also emblazoned with her name in gold.)\n\nAntony Jones/Getty Images\n\nHere’s another look at the lacy floral cuff.\n\nTristan Fewings/Getty Images\n\nWith her small diamond hoop earrings, Sarah wore a choker necklace that looks straight out of an Edwardian lady’s jewelry box. The elaborate choker has floral motifs in its design. I’d wager that this necklace is indeed from either the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, and that it’s on loan to Sarah.\n\nAntony Jones/Getty Images\n\nHere’s a look at both of the York ladies’ ensembles for the event."
