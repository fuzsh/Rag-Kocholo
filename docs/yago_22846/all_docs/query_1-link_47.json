        "text": "Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, (June 26, 1899 – July 17, 1918) was the third daughter of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna (Princess Alix of Hesse and By Rhine).\n\nContemporaries sources described Maria as a pretty, flirtatious girl, broadly built woman with light brown hair and large blue eyes that were known in the family as “Marie’s saucers”. Her French tutor Pierre Gilliard said Maria was tall and well-built, with rosy cheeks. Tatiana Botkina thought the expression in Maria’s eyes was “soft and gentle.” As an infant and toddler, her physical appearance was compared to one of Botticelli’s angels. Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia nicknamed her “The Amiable Baby” because of her good nature.\n\nMaria’s siblings were Grand Duchess Olga of Russia, Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia, and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. Maria’s Russian title (Velikaya Knyazhna Великая Княжна) is most precisely translated as “Grand Princess”, meaning that Maria, as an “Imperial Highness” was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were “Royal Highnesses”. “Grand Duchess” is the most widely used English translation of the title.\n\nHowever, in keeping with her parents’ desire to raise Maria and her siblings simply, even servants addressed the Grand Duchess by her first name and patronym, Maria Nikolaevna. She was also called by the French version of her name, “Marie,” or by the Russian nicknames “Masha” or “Mashka”.\n\nMaria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and “bellowed” at the people who irritated her. Maria’s moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Empress and her daughters referred to as a visit from “Madame Becker.”\n\nLord Louis Mountbatten and Grand Duchess Maria\n\nYoung Maria enjoyed innocent flirtations with the young soldiers she encountered at the palace and on family holidays. She particularly loved children and, had she not been a Grand Duchess, would have loved nothing more than to marry a Russian soldier and raise a large family. Until his own assassination in 1979, her first cousin, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, (born a Prince of the House of Battenberg) kept a photograph of Maria beside his bed in memory of the crush he had upon her. However, because the Russian Orthodox Church has a rule against first cousins marrying, it is highly improbable that approval for the match would have been obtained.\n\nAlexandra’s letters reveal that Maria, the middle child of the family, sometimes felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn’t loved as much as the other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. “Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that’s what our Friend said,” Alexandra wrote to her on 6 December 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. “One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it’s considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so.”\n\nAnother passion of mine besides European Royalty and it’s history has been the study of the weather. Today I begin a new series where I combine two of my passions: European Royal History and Meteorology. Weather has helped shaped historical events and the course of history itself. In this series I will look at how weather impacted significant events in European History.\n\nAccurate and detailed weather forecasts can save lives. The lack of an accurate and detailed forecast, and it’s resulting loss of life, is evident in one of the most well known historical events in which weather was a significant player; Napoleon’s war on Russia in 1812.\n\nHis Imperial Majesty Emperor Napoleon of France\n\nIn 1812, Emperor Napoleon of France gathered the largest army Europe had ever seen at the point, more than 600,000 strong. His plan was to march boldly into Moscow to attack the forces of Emperor Alexander I of Russia. Napoleon was not at all concerned that winter was approaching. Napoleons’s non concern about the coming winter was not due to having foreknowledge that Russia would be experiencing a mild winter, his overconfidence was primarily due to his obstinance and hubris.\n\nHis Imperial Majesty Emperor Alexander I of Russia\n\nIn truth, in 1812 Napoleon would not have had a long term forecast about the winter. Today we have many tools to predict the weather as we can scientifically measure the temperature, air pressure and windspeed etc. We also have many computer models, known as Numerical Weather Prediction Models which uses mathematical computations of the atmospheric and oceanic conditions to predict weather patterns based on current weather conditions. However, before these tools and technologies, the weather was predicted by the appearance of clouds or the behaviour of animals. There were also primitive thermometers and barometers that aided in forecasting the weather.\n\nAdmiral Robert FitzRoy\n\nThe term forecast wasn’t even part of the weather vernacular in 1812. The word ‘forecast’ was invented by Admiral Robert FitzRoy in the mid 1800s. FitzRoy was a pioneering meteorologist who made accurate daily weather predictions, which he called by a new name of his own invention: “forecasts” and he defined it as such: “the term forecast is strictly applicable to such an opinion as is the result of scientific combination and calculation.” Incidentally, Admiral Robert FitRoy had royal connections. Through his father, General Lord Charles FitzRoy, Robert was a fourth great-grandson of King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland through his mistress, Barbara Palmer-Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. Born on the wrong side of the sheets as they say.\n\nBack to Napoleon. Napoleon could not foresee his campaign lasting into the winter, believing his war would be swift and decisive. Without a long term forecast for the coming winter, coupled with Napoleon’s overconfidence, this left him unprepared for the difficulties that were ahead.\n\nIt was not just winter weather that made an impact on Napoleon’s troops. On June 24th Napoleon entered and attacked Vilnius, Lithuanian. That same afternoon severe thunderstorms and accompanying torrential downpours had a devastating impact on the siege. Since there were no discernible roads in this area of Lithuania, the ruts of the wagons on the soft and saturated ground were turned into bottomless mires. Wagon sank up to their hubs; horses dropped from exhaustion; men lost their boots.\n\nAfter the storms, the sun reemerged bringing along with it oppressive heat and humidity which would bake the deep ruts into canyons of concrete, where horses would break their legs and wagons their wheels. With the numerous dead horses blocking any forward movements, the troops were left with living in swamp-like conditions with dysentery and influenza raging though the ranks with hundreds laying sick in a field hospital. The Crown Prince of Wurttemberg (future King Wilhelm I of Wurttemberg) reported 21 men dead in bivouacs from sunstroke and a further 345 soldiers were sick.\n\nThere are four types of weather fronts that cause thunderstorms: cold front, warm front, stationary front and occluded front. Thunderstorms can become extremely severe and can appear seemingly out of nowhere along any of these front lines. Cold fronts tend to move faster than the other types of fronts and are associated with the most violent types of weather such as severe and super cell thunderstorms, although any type of front can produce these same storms. Since the historical records indicate that severe thunderstorms were followed by oppressive heat and humidity on June 28th 1812 in Vilnius, Lithuanian, it is safe to conclude that these storms were part of a warm front that moved through the region.\n\nNapoleon reached Moscow in mid September. By mid October with the French having set fire to large portions of Moscow, the French were holding onto a tenuous victory. An official French Imperial Delegation was sent to negotiate an armistice and a permanent peace with the Russian Emperor. The French were received with all civility, and we’re encouraged that the Russian soldiers wanted peace. On October 19th, after 35 days in the city, the French began to leave Moscow.\n\nThe Retreat from Moscow\n\nNapoleon left Moscow at the head of 95,000 men, with 500 cannons and an uncertain number of wagons (estimates range from 4,000 up to 40,000, with around 20,000 perhaps most likely). The wagon train included the Imperial HQ, the pontoon train, thousands of wagons filled with food and just as many filled with the loot of Moscow. Although Napoleon was victorious in his siege of Moscow, it was with his retreat from Moscow that the Russians delivered the French Army its crushing blow…with help from the weather.\n\nAlthough the Russian campaign was over by mid-October, the encroaching winter weather was heavy on the minds of Napoleon’s closest advisers. The return to France would take several months. Early on November 5th Napoleon reached Smorgoni. That evening he held a conference with his marshals – Murat, Prince Eugene of Savoy, Berthier, Lefebvre, Bessières, Ney and Davout all attended. At this meeting Napoleon announced that he was going to leave the remnants of the army and return to Paris.\n\nAt 10pm Napoleon left with a small party and a small escort of Polish cavalry. Napoleon’s decision to leave the army was probably correct, although his enemies did portray it as a cowardly betrayal of his army. Napoleon had left Marshal Murat in charge of the army. He proved to be a poor choice. Around 20,000 men (mainly stragglers) were lost between Smorgoni and Vilna due to the harsh weather conditions. This was the period of severe frosts, with the temperature dropping to -20c (-4F) on December 5th and -26c (-32.2F) December 9th.\n\nThe army was equipped with summer clothing only, and they did not have the means to protect themselves from the cold. In addition, the army lacked the ability to forge caulkined shoes for the horses to enable them to walk over roads that had become iced over. As Napoleon’s army marched further from Vilna temperatures fell further to -40 degrees C. (-40F) The soldiers fell to frostbite and starvation. In one 24-hour period, 50,000 horses died from the cold.\n\nIn his memoir, Napoleon’s close adviser, Armand de Caulaincourt, recounted scenes of massive loss, and offered a vivid description of mass death through hypothermia.\n\n“The cold was so intense that bivouacking was no longer supportable. If the soldiers resisted the craving for sleep it would prolong their agony for a short while, but not saving them, for in this condition the drowsiness engendered by cold was irresistibly strong. Sleep comes inevitably, and to sleep is to die. This kind of death by freezing happened to thousands of individuals. The road was covered with their corpses.”\n\nOf the 600,000 men who marched into Russia, only 150,000 would limp home. It was the beginning of the end for Napoleon’s empire, and heralded the emergence of Russia as a power in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Russian campaign a saying arose that the Generals, along with Janvier and Février (January and February) defeated Napoleon. This demonstrates that without knowledge of the weather Napoleon’s troops were ill prepared to safely navigate the land and keeping their troops and animals safe.\n\nIn this post of examining the connections depicted in the book The Camera and the Tsars by Charlotte Zeepvat, I will look at how the Romanovs and the British Royal Family are connected. As I stated last week the only survivng daughter of Tsar Alexander II, Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, married HRH Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Britain’s Queen Victoria.\n\nHRH The Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha & Duke of Edinburg\n\nGrand Duchess Marie at the time of her wedding, 1874.\n\nThe marriage between the two was not a happy one. I think you had two very strong personalities involved. The new Duchess of Edinburgh was not popular in Britain. She was seen as rather arrogant. The squabble with her mother-in-law on how she should be address may be evidence of that haughtiness. From her birth she was an Imperial Highness as the daughter of an Emperor. However, once she married her husband she was only entitled to the style Her Royal Highness. Her father was not helpful in this instance for he also supported that his daughter should be continued to be styled as an Imperial Highness and that she should have precedence over the Princess of Wales. This attitude outraged Queen Victoria. Marie, Duchess of Edinburgh had a difficult time accepting the fact that Princess of Wales had precedence over her, even though the Princess of Wales was the daughter of a mere King (Christian IX of Denmark) while she was the daughter of an Emperor of Russia. Marie seems to have been most content when in 1893 her husband succeeded his uncle, Ernst II, as the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Marie was eager to be out of England and as the daughter of a sovereign duke she would now outrank her sister-in-law.\n\nMarie and Alfred had five children, one boy and four daughters (there was a still born son in 1879). I will briefly discuss the three eldest.\n\nHereditary Prince Alfred of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nThe eldest son, Alfred (1874-1899), became the Hereditary Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha upon his father’s accession to the Ducal throne. He does not seem to have had a happy life. In 1995 his engagement to HRH Princess Elsa Matilda Marie of Württemberg, elder twin daughter of the late Duke Wilhelm Eugene of Württemberg and his wife Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia. Vera was a first cousin to Marie and the grand daughter of Tsar Nicolas I of Russia. The marriage between young Alfred (called Affie) and Princess Elsa never happened and in 1899 suffering from syphilis and sever depression Alfred shot himself on his parents silver wedding anniversary. He survived the initial gun shot but died three days later at the Martinnsbrunn Sanatorium in Gratsch near Meran in the South Tyrol. He was only 24 years old.\n\nHRH Princess Marie of Edinburgh, Princess of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nThe next child was Marie (1875-1938) who at one point was thought of being a suitable candidate to marry the future King George V of Great Britain. The fathers of the prospective couple favored the match, Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh and Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, while the mothers, Alexandra, Princess of Wales and Marie, the Duchess of Edinburgh did not. Marie did not care for the British Royal Family and Alexandra hated Germans because of how they defeated Denmark in an unjust war in 1864. Marie eventually married Ferdinand, King of Romania a member of the Catholic branch of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen line.\n\nHRH Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine with her daughter, Elizabeth\n\nThe next daughter, Victoria-Melita, called Ducky within the family, was first married to her paternal first cousin, Ernst-Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine. They had one daughter Elizabeth, who died in 1903 from typhoid after drinking from a contaminated stream two years after her parents divorce. They were only able to divorce after the death of Queen Victoria who did not support their divorce. Ducky had known her second husband, her maternal first cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia, for a long time but Kirill’s mother did not support the match. After a close call where Grand Duke Cyril almost lost his life in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 decided to marry Ducky. The couple were married on 8 October 1905 in Tegernsee with few family members in attendance. The marriage outraged Tsar Nicolas II and Tsarina Alexandra of Russia. The primary issues with the marriage was that Cyril and Ducky were first cousins and the Russian Orthodox Church forbade marriages between first cousins.\n\nHowever the real reason the marriage was controversial and angered the Tsar and Tsarina was that Ducky’s first husband was the brother of Tsarina Alexandra of Russia. The Tsarina did not like her former sister-in-law and first cousin and she greatly disapproved of the marriage. For his behavior Nicholas II had his cousin Cyril stripped of his title of Grand Duke and his style His Imperial Highness and all other royal orders and his position in the Russian Navy and was banished from Russia. In 1908 when his Cyril’s uncle, Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia died he became third in line to the Russian throne behind the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, eldest son of Nicholas II, and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, the Tsar’s brother. Cyril was restored to all his former titles and styles and welcomed back to Russia. His wife was given the title Grand Duchess of Russia and was styled as Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna.\n\nHRH Dowager Grand Duchess Maire of Saxe-Coburgh-Gotha & Dowager Duchess of Edinburgh shortly before her death.\n\nNow back to Marie. Her husband died July 30, 1900 from throat cancer. Since their younger son Affie had died the previous year this left a vacancy for the throne of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The Duke’s older brother was the Prince of Wales and he had already renounced his place in the succession in order for Alfred to succeed. After Alfred came his next brother, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and his son, also called Prince Arthur, and both of these individuals renounced their claims. The succession finally went to Charles Edward, Duke of Albany the son of Queen Victoria’s youngest son, Prince Leopold who died from hemophilia in 1884.\n\nMarie remained in Coburg even during the first World War in which she became increasingly pro-German. She did not live long past the war. Even though she was pro-German and the wife of a German sovereign she was still treated with contempt. At one point on her way home from a meeting with the Red Cross her car, containing her and her two young daughters, was stopped when a mob recognized her and despised her for her Russian heritage. It took the police over an hour to extricate her safely from the situation. After that incident she went to live in exile in Switzerland where she died on October 24 at the age of 67.\n\nI do feel bad for Marie despite her poor reputation. I have read that was not all of who she could be. It is said that she truly had a kind heart and George V was said to have been fond of her. She lost her German titles at the end of the war and with the revolution in Russia she lost her Imperial titles as well. The only titles she held was that of HRH The Dowager Duchess of Edinburgh from a country that she never considered home."
