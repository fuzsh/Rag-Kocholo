        "text": "Romanov Birthdays→ Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia, May 9\n\nNamed George after his mother's older brother, King George I of Greece, Grand Duke George Alexandrovich was born the third son of Emperor Alexander III and his wife Maria Feodorovna. As an infant, George was stronger and healthier than his brother Nicholas. He could be described as a typical Romanov. George was tall, unlike his elder brother Nicholas, handsome and full of fun. He was always getting into mischief, because his mother had a great weakness for him, getting away with it.\n\nLike his siblings, he was brought up in a spartan fashion in the English manner. They slept on camp beds, rose at six and took a cold bath, although occasionally they were allowed to take a warm bath in their mother's bathroom. Nicholas and George had a sitting-room, dining-room, play-room and bedroom, all simply furnished. The only trace of ostentation was an icon surrounded by pearls and precious stones. George's mother taught him that family life was important. Because of his parents' happy marriage, he was brought up in an atmosphere of love and security missing in many royal households.\n\nOn 27 May 1883, George's parents were crowned in a magnificent ceremony in the Uspensky Cathedral in the Kremlin in Moscow. The Emperor and Empress received the homage of the Imperial Family, including their sons, Nicholas and George, both in uniform. It was a major occasion in the life of the young Grand Duke. The family lived mostly in the security of the palace at Gatchina.\n\nGeorge was considered to be the cleverest of the Imperial children. He was also outgoing, like his mother. Along with his native Russian, George wrote faultless English, spoke fluent French, and passable German and Danish. George displayed signs of a promising career in the Navy before falling ill with tuberculosis in 1890. He was greatly weakened from this. He toured Japan, Egypt, and India with his brother Nicholas in 1891. However, while in India, George had a trouble with his leg. Although George assured his parents that he was perfectly well, they were suddenly informed he had a fever and would have to return home. In 1894, his father died unexpectedly and his brother became the Emperor. As Nicholas had no children, George immediately became Tsarevich. Due to his poor health, it was impossible for George to return to Saint Petersburg for the funeral of his father.\n\nGeorge also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George died suddenly, on 9 August 1899, at the age of 28. He had been out alone on his motorcycle and some hours later, when he failed to return, his worried staff sent out a search party. By the time they found him it was too late. A peasant woman had discovered him collapsed at the side of the road, blood oozing from his mouth as he struggled to breathe. She supported him in her arms until he died. The news reached Nicholas by telegram and he had the difficult task of telling his mother. She broke down and wept. His family were completely devastated. Nicholas was especially grief-stricken at losing his younger brother and childhood playmate.\n\nNicholas II always remembered George and his wonderful sense of humour. He would tell great jokes that amused his brother very much. Nicholas would dutifully write out the best jokes on pieces of paper and save them in a box. Years later, the Tsar would be heard laughing by himself in his room, looking through his old box of George's jokes. George's title as Heir Presumptive was passed to his younger brother, Michael, until the birth, in 1904, of Nicholas' son, Alexei. In 1910, Michael named his newborn son, George, after his late brother. This George would also die young; he was killed in a car crash in 1931 at the age of 20."
