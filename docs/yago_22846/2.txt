Biography

Russian royalty, the fourth son and fifth child of Czar Alexander III and Czarina Maria Feodorovna, the former Princess Dagmar of Denmark.

He had fallen in love with his cousin, Princess Beatrice of Saxe Coburg and Gotha, but they were forbidden to marry because the Orthodox church forbade marriages between first cousins. He eventually married the twice-divorced Natalia Brasova against his family's wishes on 30 October 1912 in Vienna, and consequently both were banished from Russia by Michael's brother, Czar Nicholas II, although they were eventually allowed to return after the beginning of the First World War two years later.

He was shot by Bolsheviks during the Russian civil war near Perm, Russia on 13 June 1918, just over a month before they murdered his brother's entire family.
