THE ATOM PHOTO COMP 2017

ATOM also announced the winner of the ATOM Photo Comp 2017 at this event.

The ATOM Photo Comp provides people with the opportunity to submit a set of three photographs adhering to a theme, with an accompanying written statement, and win fantastic prizes in the process. This year’s theme was ‘My Backyard’. Prizes for winners of each category include a Canon EOS 700D camera (RRP: $1029), generously donated by Ted’s Cameras. We received nearly 700 entries from Australian and New Zealand photographers.

And the winner of the Open category is …
