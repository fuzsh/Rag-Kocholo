        "text": "Ian Potter Museum of Art Exhibition Catalogue. The exhibition My learned object: collections & curiosities drew its content from over 25 of the University of Melbourne’s cultural collections. Rich and varied, the cultural collections form an integral part of the workings of the University. Primary documents – decorative arts, botanical specimens, zoological specimens, paintings, models, furniture, bones, photographs, books, scientific equipment, ephemera (the list goes on… ) from across all university collections can be largely divided into three main categories, namely the arts, the sciences and the archives."
