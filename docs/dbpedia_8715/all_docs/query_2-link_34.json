        "text": "Former Canterbury Bulldogs hooker Michael Lichaa has been charged over an alleged domestic-related assault after catching his fiancee being \"intimate\" with a former teammate.\n\n'DOESN'T WASH': Raiders sack four players over glassing cover-up\n\n'NO EXCUSES': NRL slaps Payne Haas with biggest fine possible\n\n'NOT TRUE': Wally Lewis responds to bombshell affair claims\n\nLichaa, who played for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs until being released at the end of the 2019 NRL season, was at a Connells Point home on Sunday morning when the alleged assault occurred.\n\nPolice allege Lichaa, 27, was involved in an argument at the house with his girlfriend Kara Childerhouse and current Bulldogs star Adam Elliott.\n\nThe former Canterbury player reportedly woke up in the early hours of the morning to see his fiancee in an \"intimate\" act with his former teammate, according to reports from Channel Seven.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported that Lichaa’s fiancee told police she was caught \"making out\" with Elliott.\n\nPolice have alleged that Lichaa assaulted Ms Childerhouse and punched a window, severely injuring his hand.\n\nThe former Bulldogs player suffered serious injuries to his arms and was taken to a Sydney hospital for surgery.\n\nHe was later charged with domestic-related assault, property destruction and intimidation offences, and was granted bail to appear at Sutherland Local Court on Wednesday.\n\nNeighbours alerted police to a disturbance at the residence at 4:50am, after which point police arrived to what they described as a domestic incident that left Lichaa bleeding badly from a cut hand.\n\nPolice say Elliott, 26, and Ms Childerhouse were also at the home with Lichaa when they arrived.\n\n“It’s alleged that the man had been involved in an argument with another man and woman in the early hours of the morning,’’ police said.\n\n“During the argument the man allegedly assaulted the 26-year-old woman, known to him,” the statement said.\n\nNRL integrity unit informed of alleged incident\n\nThe Bulldogs said the incident involving Elliott had been reported to the NRL's integrity unit.\n\n“The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have overnight been made aware of an alleged incident involving Adam Elliott,” the club said in a statement.\n\n“The club has reported the matter to the NRL Integrity Unit and is currently working with them.\n\n“The club is not in a position to comment further at this stage.”\n\nLichaa started his NRL career at Cronulla in 2014 before moving to the Bulldogs for the 2015 season. He played 98 NRL matches for the club.\n\nHe also played for Lebanon at the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nThe NRL does not typically comment on non-registered players."
