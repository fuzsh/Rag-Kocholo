Raised largely in an orphanage and by various relatives, Martin started out playing drums, then switched to C melody saxophone and subsequently tenor saxophone, the latter the one with which he would be identified. Early on, he had intended to become a journalist. He had hoped that he would earn enough money from his musical work to enter Ohio State University, but instead, he wound up becoming an accomplished musician. Martin led his own band while he was in high school, then played in various local bands. Freddy spent his spare time selling musical instruments; which also gave him an excuse to listen to the Lombardos play at the \"Music Box\". After working on a ship's band, Martin joined the Mason-Dixon band, then joined Arnold Johnson and Jack Albin. It was with Albin's \"Hotel Pennsylvania Music\" that he made his first recordings, for Columbia's Harmony, Velvet Tone, and Clarion 50-cent labels in 1930.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After a couple of years, his skill began attracting other musicians. One such musician was Guy Lombardo, who would remain friends with Martin throughout his life. After graduation from high school, Martin accepted a job at the H.N. White musical instrument company. When Lombardo was playing in Cleveland, Martin tried giving Lombardo some saxophones, which proved unsuccessful. Fortunately, Lombardo did get to hear Martin's band. One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career really got started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At the Bossert Marine Room, Martin pioneered the \"Tenor Band\" style that swept the sweet-music industry. With his own tenor sax as melodic lead, Martin fronted an all-tenor sax section with just two brasses and a violin trio plus rhythm. The rich, lilting style quickly spawned imitators in hotels and ballrooms nationwide. \"Tenor bands\", usually with just the three tenors and one trumpet, could occasionally be found playing for older dancers well into the 1980s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Martin band recorded first for Columbia Records in 1932. As the company was broke and signing no new contracts, the band switched to Brunswick Records after one session and remained with that label till 1938. During his tenure at Brunswick/ARC, half of his recordings were issued on ARC's stable of budget priced labels (Banner, Conqueror, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, Romeo and Vocalion) as well as scores of non-vocal takes issued on ARC's special theater use label, sold only to movie theaters as background music. In 1938, he signed with Victor and was assigned to RCA's Bluebird and Victor Records. The band also recorded pseudonymously in the early 1930s, backing singers such as Will Osborne.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Martin took his band into many prestigious hotels, including the Roosevelt Grill in New York City and the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. A fixture on radio, his sponsored shows included NBC's Maybelline Penthouse Serenade of 1937. But Martin's real success came in 1941 with an arrangement from the first movement of Tchaikovsky's B-flat piano concerto. Martin recorded the piece instrumentally, but soon lyrics were put in and it was re-cut as \"Tonight We Love\"[3] with Clyde Rogers' vocal – becoming his biggest hit. It sold over one million copies by 1946, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The success of \"Tonight We Love\" prompted Martin to adopt several other classical themes (of Rachmaninoff, Grieg, and others), which featured the band's pianists Jack Fina, Murray Arnold and Barclay Allen. He recorded \"A Lover's Concerto\", adapted from baroque composer Christian Petzold's \"Minuet in G major\", two decades before pop group The Toys released it. At this time Martin enlarged the orchestra to a strength of six violins, four brasses and a like number of saxes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His band's first hits included \"Intermezzo\" and \"the Hut-Sut Song\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Martin was nicknamed \"Mr. Silvertone\" by saxophonist Johnny Hodges. Chu Berry named Martin his favorite saxophonist. He has also been idolized by many other saxophonists, including Eddie Miller. Although his playing has been admired by so many jazz musicians, Martin never tried to be a jazz musician. Martin always led a sweet styled band. Unlike most sweet bands that just played dull music, Martin's band turned out to be one of the most musical and most melodic of all the typical hotel-room sweet bands. According to George T. Simon, Martin's band was \"one of the most pleasant, most relaxed dance bands that ever flowed across the band scene.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He used the banner \"Music in the Martin Manner.\" Russ Morgan used a similar banner when he finally landed a radio series with his own band in 1936. (Morgan's title was \"Music in the Morgan Manner\".) Russ had been playing in Martin's band and the two were good friends for years. Morgan used some of Martin's arrangements when he started his band.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Martin also had a good ear for singers. At one time or another, Martin employed Merv Griffin, Buddy Clark, pianists Sid Appleman and Terry Shand, saxophonist Elmer Feldkamp, Stuart Wade, violinist Eddie Stone, and many others. Helen Ward was a singer for Martin just before she joined Benny Goodman's new band.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Martin's popularity as a bandleader led him to Hollywood in the 1940s where he and his band appeared in a handful of films, including Seven Days' Leave (1942), Stage Door Canteen (1943) and Melody Time (1948), among others.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1950s and 1960s Martin continued to perform on the radio and also appeared on TV. Untroubled by changing musical tastes, he continued to work at major venues and was musical director for Elvis Presley's first appearance in Las Vegas. Still in demand for hotel work, Martin entered the 1970s with an engagement at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, he was part of two tours of one-nighters that were known as The Big Band Cavalcade. Among the other performers on the show were Margaret Whiting, Bob Crosby, Frankie Carle, Buddy Morrow, Art Mooney and George Shearing. When the tours ended, Martin returned to the West Coast. In 1977, Martin was asked to lead Guy Lombardo's band when Lombardo was hospitalized with a heart condition.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Martin continued leading his band until the early 1980s, although by then, he was semi-retired. Freddy Martin died on September 30, 1983, in Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, after suffering a second stroke. He was 76 years old.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The 1947 song \"Pico and Sepulveda\" was recorded by Martin under the alias of \"Felix Figueroa and his Orchestra\" and was frequently featured on Dr. Demento's syndicated radio show. It was also featured in the 1980 surrealist film Forbidden Zone.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1984 - Keisha Buchanan (vocals, Sugababes) is born.\n\nin 1984 - Kiss kicked off a 14-date UK tour at the Brighton Centre.\n\nin 1984 - The music division of Thorn EMI once said to be the greatest recording organisation in the world reported a world-wide loss of almost $5 million during the last six months.\n\nin 1984 - UK station Capitol Radio launched 'The Network Chart' show hosted by David 'Kid' Jenson.\n\nin 1985 - T-Pain/Faheem Rasheed Najm (US singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer, actor; Nappy Headz) is born.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1986 - Tommy Reynolds dies at age 69.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] American clarinetist and band leader, he formed his band in 1940, its more celebrated members included the saxophone player Serge Chaloff and the vocalist Hal Linden, known in later years for his portrayal of the title character in ''Barney Miller'' on television.

He was later studio manager of WOR-TV and the first general manager of WOR-FM, now WRKS-FM. At the time of his death he was director of broadcast standards for RKO General Inc.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was instrumental in the development of the \"American Sound\" in classical music. He has been described as a modernist, a neoromantic, a neoclassicist, and a composer of \"an Olympian blend of humanity and detachment\" whose \"expressive voice was always carefully muted\" until his late opera Lord Byron which, in contrast to all his previous work, exhibited an emotional content that rises to \"moments of real passion\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Virgil Thomson was born in Kansas City, Missouri. As a child, he befriended Alice Smith, great-granddaughter of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter-day Saint movement. After World War I, he entered Harvard University thanks to a loan from Dr. Fred M. Smith, the president of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and father of Alice Smith. His tours of Europe with the Harvard Glee Club helped nurture his desire to return there. At Harvard, Thomson focused his studies on the piano work of Erik Satie. He studied in Paris on fellowship for a year, and after graduating, lived in Paris from 1925 until 1940. He eventually studied with Nadia Boulanger and became a fixture of \"Paris in the twenties.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1925, in Paris, he cemented a relationship with painter Maurice Grosser (October 23, 1903 - December 22, 1986), who was to become his life partner and frequent collaborator. Later he and Grosser lived at the Hotel Chelsea, where he presided over a largely ... salon that attracted many of the leading figures in music and art and theater, including Leonard Bernstein, Tennessee Williams, and many others. He also encouraged many younger composers and literary figures such as Ned Rorem, Lou Harrison, John Cage, Frank O'Hara, and Paul Bowles. Grosser died in 1986, three years before Thomson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His most important friend from this period was Gertrude Stein, who was an artistic collaborator and mentor to him.

His definition of music was famously \"that which musicians do,\" and his views on music are radical in their insistence on reducing the rarefied aesthetics of music to market activity. He even went so far as to claim that the style a piece was written in could be most effectively understood as a consequence of its income source.

Women composers were not part of that circle, and some have suggested that, as a critic, he pointedly ignored their works, or adopted a patronizing tone.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Thomson's score for The River was used in the 1983 ABC made-for-television movie The Day After.

He collaborated on a number of musicals, most notably The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N (a musical version of Leo Rosten's stories about the fictional Jewish character Hyman Kaplan), How to Steal an Election, and A Joyful Noise.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He hosted the radio show Oscar Brand's Folksong Festival every Saturday at 10 p.m. on WNYC-AM 820 in New York City, which ran into in its 70th year. The show ran more or less continuously since its debut on December 10, 1945,[8] making it the longest-running radio show with the same host, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Over its run it introduced such talents to the world as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Woody Guthrie, Arlo Guthrie, Huddie Ledbetter, Joni Mitchell, Peter, Paul & Mary, Judy Collins, the Kingston Trio, Pete Seeger and The Weavers. In order to make sure that his radio program could not be censored he refused to be paid by WNYC for the next 70 years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He wrote the lyrics to the song \"A Guy is a Guy\" (1952), which became a hit for Doris Day. He also wrote the English lyrics to the song \"Shlub-a-Dubba-Dub\" (1961) which became a minor hit for Mitch Miller.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He contributed stories and songs for the \"Young People's Records\" label, including \"Noah's Ark\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a great friend to the folksinger Jean Ritchie for many years, and the pair recorded several duets together, including the British song \"Keys to Canterbury\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although Brand was anti-Stalinist and was never a member of the Communist party, the House Committee on Un-American Activities referred to his show as a \"pipeline of communism\", because of his belief in the rights under the First Amendment of blacklisted artists to have a platform to reach the public. Accordingly, in June 1950, Brand was named in the premier issue of Red Channels as a Communist sympathizer, along with Paul Robeson, Josh White and Pete Seeger.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While Brand was not as well-known or radical an activist as some of his contemporaries, he was a long-standing supporter of civil rights. He told stories of buying food for Leadbelly when the two traveled together in segregated areas, and participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brand was one of the original organizers of the Newport Folk Festival which began in 1959.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the early 1960s, Brand brought his substantial connections in the worldwide folk music community home to his native Canada with his CTV and then CBC television program Let's Sing Out. The program was staged at and broadcast from university campuses across Canada and both revived the careers of long-forgotten pioneers of the folk music movement such as Malvina Reynolds, the Womenfolk, The Weavers and others and introduced then-unknown Canadian singers such as Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot. His score for the 1968 Off-Broadway show, How to Steal An Election sent up the current belief that charisma would help a candidate win. Songs included \"Charisma\" (sung by Calvin Coolidge) and \"Down Among the Grassroots\". The album cover was decorated with election buttons including the 1968 Nixon campaign.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brand also served during the 1960s as a board member of the Children's Television Workshop and participated in the development of Sesame Street. Because of some mild disagreements that had occurred between Brand and the board members regarding the appropriate setting for the show, it has been reputed that as a playful joke, the character of Oscar the Grouch was named after him, although there are dueling tales as to the origin of the character.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In May, 1976 Brand appeared in Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum at the Memorial Celebration for Phil Ochs, performing Ochs' \"Love Me I'm A Liberal\" with updated lyrics.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brand was given the Peabody Award for broadcast excellence in 1982 for his broadcast The Sunday Show on National Public Radio, and was awarded the Personal Peabody Award in 1997 (shared with Oprah Winfrey).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brand authored a number of short stories, including:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] \"The Miser's Gold,\" about two young brothers who dare each other to spend the night in an allegedly haunted house - only to discover that \"allegedly\" is inapplicable. The boys encounter the ghost of a wealthy but lonely man; greatly amused by their reasons for being there, he names them as heirs to his considerable fortune.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] \"The Hitchhiker,\" about a young man who, on his way home from a party, picks up a beautiful young woman who turns out to be much more than she seems.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dramatic readings of these stories were issued as cut-out cardboard records on the back of Honeycomb cereal boxes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On January 18, 2010, WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour celebrated Brand's upcoming 90th birthday and the 65th anniversary of his radio career before an audience from Lexington, Kentucky, where host Michael Johnathan and guest Josh White, Jr. performed with Brand and talked with him about his life. On February 7, 2010, CBC Radio's \"Sunday Edition\" celebrated Brand's life on the occasion of his 90th birthday.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2016 - Mary J. Blige debuts her Apple Music talk show, The 411, and welcomes Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary ....... as her first guest. Halfway through the intimate conversation, Blige bursts into a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's protest anthem \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" in a bid to address the rash of police brutality against African Americans. The attempt falls flat with viewers, who heckle the singer on social media.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At first, it seems like a typical interview. Blige, who first met Hillary while performing at the Democratic National Convention, peppers the Secretary of State with questions about faith, family, and living in the public eye before broaching the subject of police brutality. Blige is concerned about the increasing number of unarmed black men and women being killed by police throughout the country. Being a singer, Blige is reminded of Springsteen's ballad about the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant killed by NYPD officers who mistakenly believed he was reaching for a gun instead of his wallet. Mid-interview, she clutches Hillary's hand and launches into a rendition of the song:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]If an officer stops you, always be polite[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]And never ever run away[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Promise Mama you'll keep your hands inside[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Is it a gun?

The actual conversation, however, does delve into matters of race and implicit bias. Blige stands by her decision.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"I wanted to incorporate the song in the show because the lyrics resonated with me so deeply and so heavily because of all the shootings and police brutality and I never got a chance to say anything,\" she said. \"I'm a singer first ...so that's the only way I can express myself and ...the only way I can get that reaction from (Hillary) is to sing it.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]30 September[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 4 of 4[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]1 October [/FONT][FONT=&quot]……………………………………………………………….. total views 697,113\n\npage 1 of 4\n\nin 1602 - Hernando de Cabezón, Spanish composer and organist, son of Antonio de, dies at 61. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Only a few of his works are extant today, and he is chiefly remembered for publishing the bulk of his father's work.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was born in Madrid and probably studied music with his father. From January to December 1559 he was employed at the royal chapel, where his father worked, as a substitute organist. He was appointed organist of the Sigüenza Cathedral in 1563, and when his father died in 1566, he succeeded him as royal organist. Like his father, he accompanied the court on its travels; this brought him to Portugal, among other places, where he lived in 1580–81. In 1598, when Philip II of Spain died, Cabezón went on as royal organist with his son Philip III of Spain. He drafted his will in 1598 and died four years later in Valladolid.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Only a few of Cabezón's compositions survive. He is chiefly remembered for Obras de música para tecla, arpa y vihuela (Madrid, 1578), a large collection of music by his father (also including five pieces by Hernando). The Obras constitute the single most important source for Antonio de Cabezón's work. Hernando's own works include an organ setting of Ave maris stella and several keyboard intabulations. All of these pieces are of very high quality, and the intabulations are notable for their rather radical departures from the vocal originals.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1644 - Alessandro Stradella (Italian composer; operas/cantatas/oratorios) is born.\n\nin 1644 - Jean Rousseau, composer is born.\n\nin 1708 - John Blow dies at age 59.

(He died at his house in Broad Sanctuary, and buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1724 - Giovanni Battista Cirri, Italian cellist and composer, is born at Forli. He studied with his brother, Ignazio Cirri (1711-87), organist at Forli Cathedral from 1759, and with Giovanni Balzani, organist at the church of the Madonna del Fuoco. After taking holy orders in 1739, he was a cellist and composer at the Basilica of S. Petronio in Bologna. In 1759 he was elected a member of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna. In 1764 he went to London as a chamber musician to the Duke of York and as director of music to the Duke of Gloucester, brother of King George III. He also was active as a concert artist. Returning to Forli in 1780, he assisted his brother at the Cathedral. In 1782 he was made principal cellist at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples. In 1787 he was named his brother's successor as maestro di cappella at Forli Cathedral. He wrote much chamber music, demonstrating a special flare for the cello, and also composed sacred works. – Died at Forli, June 11, 1808.\n\nin 1724 - Anton Cajetan Adlgasser, German organist and composer, is born at Inzell, Upper Bavaria. He received training in organ and violin. He may have also studied composition with Eberlin in Salzburg, whom he succeeded as court and cathedral organist in 1750. From 1760 he also was organist at the Trinity Church there. Mozart praised him as a master of counterpoint. He wrote an opera, La Nitteti (Salzburg, 1766), school dramas, 7 syms., keyboard concertos, oratorios, liturgical works, and keyboard sonatas. – Died of a stroke while playing the organ, Salzburg, Dec. 22, 1777.\n\nin 1735 - Johann Baptist Christoph Toeschi, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1770 - Louis-Gabriel Guillemain, French composer and violinist, dies at 64.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Guillemain is thought to have been born in Paris, was brought up by the Count de Rochechouart, and started studying violin at an early age. He was then sent to Italy to complete his training as violinist, and studied under Giovanni Battista Somis in Turin. At the age of 24, Guillemain was working in Lyons, where he quickly established himself as one of the most sought-after performers, and was appointed first violinist of the Acadèmie de Musique. His opus 1, Premier livre de sonates for violin and basso continuo, was published in Dijon in 1734.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Guillemain eventually moved back to Paris, where, in 1737, he became a musicien ordinaire to the King. His career was progressing rapidly, and by the early 1740s the composer was among the highest-paid musicians at the court, regularly performing in private concerts before the royal couple. He continued publishing his music, and his works were frequently performed at the court in the late 1740s and early 1750s. Fellow composer Louis-Claude Daquin praised Guillemain in his 1752 Lettre sur les hommes célèbres:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] When one speaks of a man full of fire, genius and life, one has to think of Monsieur Guillemain, Musician to the King; he is perhaps the most extraordinary and adroit violinist one can hear play. There are no difficulties that can stump him and he can compose learned pieces which sometimes embarrass his rivals. Among the great Masters, this celebrated artist is one of the most productive. His works are full of touching beauty.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]However, Guillemain's private life was troubled. He was apparently a heavy drinker, especially in his later years, and he was also continually in debt because of his affinity for making expensive purchases. He died in Chaville, then a small settlement near Paris, in 1770; some contemporary accounts describe his death as a bloody suicide, with the composer stabbing himself with a knife fourteen times. However, the drinking habit and the fact that Guillemain was buried, may indicate that he died a natural death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1771 - Pierre Baillot (French violinist, composer; leader of the Paris Opéra) is born at Passy, near Paris. At the age of nine, he became a violin pupil of Sainte-Marie. Following studies with Pollani in Rome, he returned to Paris in 1791 and became a member of the orchestra of the Theatre Feydeau. In 1795 he became a teacher of violin at the newly opened Paris Conservatory. During this time, he also pursued training in composition with Cherubini, Reicha, and Catel. In 1802 he became a member of Napoleon's private instrumental ensemble. From 1805 to 1808 he toured in Russia with the cellist Lamarre. In 1814 he organized a series of chamber music concerts in Paris, but also continued to make tours. In 1821 he became first violinist in the orchestra of the Paris Opera. He also was solo violinist in the Royal Orchestra from 1825. Baillot's repertoire was quite extensive for a violinist of his day. In addition to the great composers of the period, he included the works of early masters at his concerts. On March 23, 1828, he was soloist in the first Paris performance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto at a concert of the Societe des Concerts du Cons. Among his works were a Symphony Concertante for Two Violins and Orchestra, nine violin concertos, three string quartets, 15 trios, and six violin duos. He wrote the manual L'Art du violon (1834; Eng. tr., 1991, as (The Art of the Violin). – Died at Paris, Sept. 15,1842.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1804 - Edward Sobolewski, (actually, Johann Friedrich Eduard), German-born American violinist, conductor, and composer of Polish descent, is born at Konigsberg. He was a composition pupil of Zelter in Berlin and of Weber in Dresden (1821-24). He became an opera conductor in Konigsberg (1830), and was founder conductor of the orchestra of the Philharmonische Gesellschaft (from 1838) and conductor of the choir of the Academy of Music (from 1843); subsequently was director of music at the Bremen Theater (from 1854). In 1859 he emigrated to the U.S., settling in Milwaukee, then a center of German musical immigrants; was founder-conductor of the Milwaukee Phil. Society Orchestra (1860). He then settled in St. Louis, where he conducted the Philharmonic Society (1860-66); was professor of vocal music at Bonham's Female Seminary (from 1869). His works include the operas Imogen (1833), Velleda (1836), Salvator Rosa (1848), Komala (Weimar, Oct. 30, 1858), Mohega, die Blume des Waldes (Milwaukee, Oct. 11, 1859, to his own libretto, in German, on an American subject dealing with an Indian .... saved by Pulaski from death), and An die Freude (Milwaukee, 1859), as well as oratorios, symphonic poems, oratorios and other choral works, songs, etc. – Died at St. Louis, May 17,1872.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1808 - Fryderyk Edward Sobolewski, composer is born.\n\nin 1820 - Gustav Adolf Heinze, German conductor and composer, is born at Leipzig. He received his early musical education from his father, a clarinetist in the Gewandhaus Orch. in Leipzig, and joined that orch. as clarinetist at the age of 16. He then conducted at the Breslau City Theater (1844-49), where he successfully produced 2 operas: Loreley (1846) and Die Ruinen von Tharandt (1847). In 1850 he went to Amsterdam, where he founded a singing school (1862-69); he later founded a music school in Bussum (1885). He composed, besides his operas, several oratorios and other choral works. He published an autobiography (Amsterdam, 1905). - Died Muiderberg, near Amsterdam, Feb. 20, 1904.\n\nin 1832 - Henry Clay Work, composer is born.\n\nin 1841 - Anatol' Vakhnyanyn, composer is born.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1857 - Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser, (nee Kennedy), Scottish singer, pianist, and folk-song collector, daughter of David Kennedy, is born at Perth. From the age of 12 she traveled with her father as his accompanist. She then studied voice with Mathilde Marchesi in Milan and Paris, and also took courses in piano with Matthay and in music history with Niecks. Inspired by the example of her father, she became a dedicated collector of folk songs. In 1905 she went to the Outer Hebrides, after which she made a specialty of research in Celtic music.\n\nShe published the editions Songs of the Hebrides (with K. Macleod; 3 vols., London, 1909, 1917, 1921), From the Hebrides (Glasgow and London, 1925), and More Songs of the Hebrides (London and N.Y., 1929), as well as the handbook Hebridean Song and the Laws of Interpretation (Glasgow, 1922). She wrote the libretto for and sang the title role in Bantock's opera The Seal Woman (1924). She also published the autobiography A Life of Song (London, 1928). – Died at Edinburgh, Nov. 22, 1930.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1865 - Paul Abraham Dukas, famous French composer and teacher, is born at Paris. From 1882 to 1888 he was a student at the Paris Conservatory, studying under Mathias (piano), Dubois (harmony), and Guiraud (composition). He won 1st prize for counterpoint and fugue in 1886, and the 2nd Prix de Rome with a cantata, Velleda (1888). He began writing music reviews in 1892, and was music critic of the Revue Hebdomadaire and Gazette des Beaux-Arts. In 1906 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'honneur, From 1910 to 1913, and again from 1928 to 1935, he was professor of the orchestra class at the Conservatory. In 1918 he was elected Debussy's successor as a member of the Conseil de I'enseignement superieur there; also taught at the Ecole Normale de Musique. Although he was not a prolific composer, Dukas wrote a masterpiece in his orchestra scherzo L'Apprenti Sorcier; his opera Arianeet Barbe-Bleue is one of the finest French operas in the impressionist style. Among his other notable works are the Symphony in C major and the ballet La Peri. Shortly before his death, he destroyed several MSS of his unfinished compositions. – Died at Paris, May 17, 1935.\n\nin 1870 - Leon Rains, American bass, is born at N.Y. He studied with Saenger in N.Y. (1891-96) and with Bouhy in Paris. He made a concert tour with Melba in the U.S. (1898), and then was a member of the Dresden Court Opera (1899-1917). He made his first appearance with the Metropolitan Opera in N.Y. on Feb. 24,1909, as Hagen in Gotterdammerung. In 1924 he settled in Los Angeles as a teacher. – Died at Los Angeles, June 11, 1954.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1873 - Max Graf, Austrian music critic, teacher, and musicologist, father of Herbert Graf, is born at Vienna. He studied music history with Hanslick at the University of Vienna (Ph.D., 1896, with the dissertation Die Musik der Frau in der Renaissancezeit; published in Vienna, 1905), and also had lessons in theory with Bruckner. From 1900 to 1938 he wrote music criticism for the Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung; he lectured on musicology and aesthetics at the Conservatory of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (1902-09); then was on the staff of the Academy of Music (1909-38). In 1938,when Austria was incorporated into the Greater German Reich, he went to the U.S. He returned to Vienna in 1947. A brilliant writer in his homeland, he lapsed into speculative journalism in his books published in America, which are rendered worthless because of blatant inaccuracies. – Died at Vienna, June 24, 1958.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1876 - Henri-Jerome Bertini, French classical composer and pianist, dies at 77.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was born into a family of musicians and attracted the attention of François-Joseph Fétis when he toured Europe as a child prodigy. As an adult he was admired both as a soloist and as a chamber musician; it was said that he played with Johann Nepomuk Hummel's simplicity and elegance without sacrificing the brilliance of the instrument. As a composer he had an original style which was rich in musical ideas, attractive melodies, and effortless harmonies. In 1848 he retired from the musical scene and settled in the Dauphiné in south-east France.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Henri Jérôme Bertini was born in London on 28 October 1798 but his family returned to Paris six months later. He received his early musical education from his father and his brother, a pupil of Muzio Clementi. He was considered a child prodigy and at the age of 12 his father took him on a tour of England, Holland, Flanders, and Germany where he was enthusiastically received. After studies in composition in England and Scotland he was appointed professor of music in Brussels but returned to Paris in 1821. It is known that Bertini gave a concert with Franz Liszt in the Salons Pape on 20 April 1828. The program included a transcription by Bertini of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A major for eight hands (the other pianists were Sowinsky and Schunke.) He was also admired as a chamber music performer, giving concerts with his friends Antoine Fontaine (violin) and Auguste Franchomme (cello). He remained active in and around Paris until around 1848 when he retired from the musical scene. In 1859 he moved to Meylan (near Grenoble) where he died on 30 September 1876.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bertini concertized widely but was not as celebrated a virtuoso as either Friedrich Kalkbrenner or Henri Herz. One of his contemporaries described his playing as having Clementi's evenness and clarity in rapid passages as well as the quality of sound, the manner of phrasing, and the ability to make the instrument sing characteristic of the school of Hummel and Moschelès. Thomas Tapper wrote:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] He was in his time a shining example of the most admirable qualities of an artist. Living in an age of garish virtuosity, and hailed as a brilliant executant himself, he maintained nevertheless the most rigorous standards of musicianship in his playing, in his compositions, and in the music which he appeared before the public to interpret. This is the more remarkable when one considers that his manhood was reached during the luxuriant period of French romanticism and that the extravagances of the literary outburst were reflected in the musical movements of the time. Virtuosity was subjected to sore temptations and many succumbed. Bertini stood for the sounder qualities of the artist and gradually acquired an extended and remunerative prestige. His life was singularly devoid of incident and official distinction, but the legacy of pedagogic works which he has left to us and his honorable activity give it every right to be called a success.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bertini was celebrated as a teacher. Antoine Marmontel, who devoted the second chapter of his work on celebrated pianists to Bertini, wrote[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] He was unsurpassed as a teacher, giving his lessons with scrupulous care and the keenest interest in his pupils' progress. After he had given up teaching, a number of his pupils continued with me, and I recognized the soundness of the principles drawn from his instruction.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] It is above all in the special class of studies and caprices, that Bertini's immense popularity is founded. It is here that he occupied a unique position and opened the path over which the next generation of composers was to rush after him. In each of his numerous collections of studies, embracing every degree of difficulty, he has insistently given to every piece, easy or difficult, brief or extended, a character of salient melody. The technical problem to be overcome presents itself as a song; even where the study is devoted to the problem of velocity the general contour falls into a melodic curve, and this is the first and transcendent cause of the universal success of these pieces, which are, furthermore, natural in respect to rhythm and carefully thought out harmonically.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Robert Schumann, in a review of one of Bertini's piano trios in the Gesammelte Schriften, comments that Bertini writes easily flowing harmony but that the movements are too long. He continues: \"With the best will in the world, we find it difficult to be angry with Bertini, yet he drives us to distraction with his perfumed Parisian phrases; all his music is as smooth as silk and satin.\" German sentimentality has never appreciated French elegance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bertini is best remembered today for his piano method Le Rudiment du pianiste, and his 20 books of approximately 500 studies.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Nonetto opus 107 for flute, oboe, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, viola, cello, double bass, and piano, composed in 1835, is one of Bertini's major works. Berlioz wrote a review in Maurice Schlesinger's widely distributed and very influential La Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris of a performance at a music evening given by the Tilmant brothers on 6 May 1838:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] That same evening a Nonetto by Bertini for piano, viola, cello, oboe, flute, horn, bassoon, trumpet and bass, was performed. It is a great and beautiful composition in which each instrument contributes to the whole according to its importance and idiomatic qualities, without trying to stand out individually. The piano itself is only entrusted those parts which contribute to the musical sense of the moment, and makes no effort toward brilliance for brilliance's sake. Beethoven himself followed this philosophy in his immortal trios. Amongst other movements, this Nonetto includes an adagio entitled La Melancolie which provides more than its title might indicate; it is so grandiose, at times so majestically sombre, that the sentiment of melancholy one expects is overshadowed by ideas of a much higher and rare order. In no way do I mean to quibble with the title, God forbid; all I wish to say is that this admirable work is not only melancholic, but also much more. In the Scherzo and Finale one finds details of graceful melancholy as well as vivacious charm, but the Adagio rises up in the centre of the work like the Mont Blanc among its neighbouring peaks; it dominates all; it is a sublime and profound meditation which provides an almost painful impression that cannot be forgotten.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Berlioz later made further comments about this evening in the July 6 edition of Le Journal des débats:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The Nonetto by Bertini... is the work of a great musician with a lively and ardent imagination, who will grow stronger and more powerful if he refrains from his attempts to encourage applause as he occasionally sought to do in the first movement. His peroration was all too obvious and he is seen to be too preoccupied with achieving success and producing effects. This detracts from the free flowing of his thoughts. This fault does not exist in the other parts of the Nonetto. In composing these the author, fully involved in his subject, undoubtedly forgot that he was actually writing for his public, and concerned himself only with the task at hand and the ultimate unity of the work. Which of these last three movements is our favourite? The Adagio, above all, is without question a noble and magnificent inspiration whose sombre poetry reminds us of the sublime greatness of Beethoven's Sonatas. This is admirable.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Nonetto was reduced to a quintet (flute or violin, violin, viola, cello and piano) by Charles Schwencke, a pianist and composer from Hamburg who was living in Paris.

His parents had a small farm and bakery. In his childhood, he learned to play violin , harp , flute and piano at the local Víta Šádka. He became a member of the novopack band and at the age of thirteen he went to the world. Russia , Germany , Poland and other countries traveled with great success. František was admired and received many offers for service in the noble settlements. However, he returned home, graduated from Jičín and started as a teaching assistant at Kopidlna. In 1827 he became a teacher in Holín , in 1835 in Střevač and finally from 1838 in Kopidlně, where he worked for 35 years. He was an excellent teacher. During his 50 years of teaching, he was awarded a silver cross with a crown.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was known as a good dancer. Polka, a dance that he later became world famous for, was still in the making. Originally, this dance was called nimera or maděra and originated with the songs Uncle Nimra bought a shimla . His original name was based on the rhythm of the dance - half. Only later did he become polish. Hilmar, however, somewhat modified this dance. Its polka have somewhat more relaxed pace than had a popular scotch at that time, but faster than the nymphs . From the small villages in the Koprivnice region, the polka expanded in the Czech countryside until it arrived in Prague . Here, as a Czech national dance, she became very popular among the rebirths and was played on all the show balls and prominent concerts. Polka penetrated into Vienna , Berlin , Paris , St. Petersburg and New York. She was also on stage at the Milan Theater. The international fame of the composer was based mainly on the Esmeralda polish named after the heroine of the Victor Hugo novel : The Church of the Mother of God in Paris. His other polls were also successful, such as Gypsy, Ochotnický, Jiřinka, Vlastenka and many others that are still playing and dancing.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He handed out his compositions in manuscripts and descriptions to anyone who showed interest in them. In the 1940s, Hilmar's polls were also published. His first polka was published in 1837 , anonymously as Polka - Nationaltanz in the collection of Prager Lieblings Galoppen für das Pianoforte No. 52 in the Berry publishing house. Hilmar thus became the composer of the first printed polka at all.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He did not gain any great fortune from his success. He also taught at the school in Kopidlna, gave private music lessons, played with his band on rural entertainment and mansions. As a village cantor, he also took care of the temple music in the local church.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Work[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He has composed over 200 dances, especially a splash, but also drops, waltzes and other contemporary dance music. He was also the author of church music. He wrote at least three masses and a number of other occasional pieces for church purposes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The artistic level of Hilmar's compositions, his musical talent and the Czechness of his music were appreciated by Bedřich Smetana and Antonín Dvořák .

In 1920 he joined the board of the newly organized Moscow Institute of Musical Science. In 1926 he left Russia and eventually settled in France. He was an energetic promoter of modern music, and a friend of Scriabin, about whom he wrote a monograph, which would have been important if his account of Scriabin's life and ideology could be trusted; he compromised himself when he wrote a devastating review of Prokofiev's Scythian Suite at a concert that never took place.

September 18] 1903 – November 5, 1989) was an American classical pianist and composer. His technique and use of tone color and the excitement of his playing were legendary. He is widely considered one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century.\n\nVladimir Horowitz was born in Kiev in the Russian Empire (now the capital of Ukraine). There are unsubstantiated claims that Horowitz was born in Berdychiv; however, his birth certificate unequivocally states Kiev as his birthplace.\n\nHorowitz was the youngest of four children of Samuil Horowitz and Sophia Bodik, who were assimilated Jews. Samuil was a well-to-do electrical engineer and a distributor of electric motors for German manufacturers. Horowitz's grandfather Joachim was a merchant (and an arts-supporter), belonging to the 1st Guild. This status gave exemption from having to reside in the Pale of Settlement. Horowitz was born in 1903, but in order to make him appear too young for military service so as not to risk damaging his hands, his father took a year off his son's age by claiming he was born in 1904. The 1904 date appeared in many reference works during the pianist's lifetime.\n\nHorowitz received piano instruction from an early age, initially from his mother, who was herself a pianist. In 1912 he entered the Kiev Conservatory, where he was taught by Vladimir Puchalsky, Sergei Tarnowsky, and Felix Blumenfeld. His first solo recital was in Kharkiv in 1920.\n\nHorowitz's fame grew, and he soon began to tour Russia where he was often paid with bread, butter and chocolate rather than money, due to the country's economic hardships caused by the Civil War. During the 1922–1923 season, he performed 23 concerts of eleven different programs in Petrograd alone. Despite his early success as a pianist, Horowitz maintained that he wanted to be a composer, and undertook a career as a pianist only to help his family, who had lost their possessions in the Russian Revolution.\n\nIn December 1925, Horowitz crossed the border into the West, ostensibly to study with Artur Schnabel. Privately intending not to return, the pianist had stuffed American dollars and British pound notes into his shoes to finance his initial concerts.\n\nOn December 18, 1925, Horowitz made his first appearance outside his home country, in Berlin. He later played in Paris, London and New York City. Horowitz was selected by Soviet authorities to represent Ukraine in the inaugural 1927 International Chopin Piano Competition; however, the pianist had decided to stay in the West and thus did not participate.\n\nHorowitz gave his United States debut on January 12, 1928, in Carnegie Hall. He played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 under the direction of Sir Thomas Beecham, who was also making his U.S. debut. Horowitz later commented that he and Beecham had divergent ideas regarding tempos, and that Beecham was conducting the score \"from memory and he didn't know\" the piece. Horowitz's success with the audience was phenomenal. Olin Downes, writing for the New York Times, was critical about the metric tug of war between conductor and soloist, but Downes credited the pianist with both a beautiful singing tone in the second movement and a tremendous technique in the finale, referring to Horowitz's playing as a \"tornado unleashed from the steppes\". In this debut performance, Horowitz demonstrated a marked ability to excite his audience, an ability he maintained for his entire career. As Downes commented, \"it has been years since a pianist created such a furor with an audience in this city.\" In his review of Horowitz's solo recital, Downes characterized the pianist's playing as showing \"most if not all the traits of a great interpreter.\" In 1933, he played for the first time with the conductor Arturo Toscanini in a performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 Emperor. Horowitz and Toscanini went on to perform together many times, on stage and in recordings. Horowitz settled in the U. S. in 1939, and became an American citizen in 1944.\n\nDespite rapturous receptions at recitals, Horowitz became increasingly unsure of his abilities as a pianist. On several occasions, the pianist had to be pushed onto the stage. Several times, he withdrew from public performances - during 1936 to 1938, 1953 to 1965, 1969 to 1974, and 1983 to 1985. He made his television debut in a concert taped at Carnegie Hall on February 1, 1968, and broadcast nationwide by CBS on September 22nd of that year.\n\nAll of Horowitz's recordings have been issued on compact disc, some several times. In the years following Horowitz's death, CDs were issued containing previously unreleased material. These included selections from Carnegie Hall recitals recorded privately for Horowitz from 1945–1951.\n\nHorowitz taught six students between 1944 and 1962: Byron Janis (1944-1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis described his relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited to become one of Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period. \"Many young people say they have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three. Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it's not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once a week. I stopped work with them, because they did not progress.\" According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, \"The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of study says something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period\". Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.\n\nIn 1933, in a civil ceremony, Horowitz married Toscanini's daughter Wanda. Although Horowitz was Jewish and Wanda Catholic, this was not an issue, as neither was observant. As Wanda knew no Russian and Horowitz knew very little Italian, their primary language became French. They had one child, Sonia Toscanini Horowitz (1934–1975). It has never been determined whether her death, from a drug overdose, was accidental or a suicide.\n\nDespite his marriage, there were persistent rumors of Horowitz's homosexuality. Arthur Rubinstein said of Horowitz that \"Everyone knew and accepted him as a homosexual.\" David Dubal wrote that in his years with Horowitz, there was no evidence that the octogenarian was sexually active, but that \"there was no doubt he was powerfully attracted to the male body and was most likely often sexually frustrated throughout his life.\" Dubal observed that Horowitz sublimated a strong instinctual sexuality into a powerful erotic undercurrent which was communicated in his piano playing. Horowitz, who denied being homosexual, once joked \"There are three kinds of pianists: Jewish pianists, homosexual pianists, and bad pianists.\"\n\nIn the 1940s, Horowitz began seeing a psychiatrist. According to sources, this was an attempt to alter his sexual orientation. In the 1960s and again in the 1970s, the pianist underwent electroshock treatment for depression.\n\nIn 1982, Horowitz began using prescribed anti-depressant medications; there are reports that he was drinking alcohol as well. Consequently, his playing underwent a perceptible decline during this period. The pianist's 1983 performances in the United States and Japan were marred by memory lapses and a loss of physical control. (At the latter, one Japanese critic likened Horowitz to a \"precious antique vase that is cracked.\") He stopped playing in public for the next two years.\n\nBy 1985, Horowitz, no longer taking medication or drinking alcohol, returned to concertizing and recording and was back on form. His first post-retirement appearance was not on stage, but in the documentary film Vladimir Horowitz: The Last Romantic. In many of his later performances, the octogenarian pianist substituted finesse and coloration for bravura, although he was still capable of remarkable technical feats. Many critics, including Harold C. Schonberg and Richard Dyer, felt that his post-1985 performances and recordings were the best of his later years.\n\nIn 1986, Horowitz announced that he would return to the Soviet Union for the first time since 1925 to give recitals in Moscow and Leningrad. In the new atmosphere of communication and understanding between the USSR and the USA, these concerts were seen as events of political, as well as musical, significance. Most of the tickets for the Moscow concert were reserved for the Soviet elite and few sold to the general public. This resulted in a number of Moscow Conservatory students crashing the concert, which was audible to viewers of the internationally televised recital. The Moscow concert, was released on a compact disc entitled Horowitz in Moscow, which reigned at the top of Billboard's Classical music charts for over a year. It was also released on VHS and, eventually, DVD. The concert was also widely seen on a Special Edition of CBS News Sunday Morning with Charles Kuralt, reporting from Moscow.\n\nFollowing the Russian concerts, Horowitz toured several European cities including Berlin, Amsterdam, and London. In June, Horowitz redeemed himself to the Japanese with a trio of well received performances in Tokyo. Later that year, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States, by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHorowitz's final tour took place in Europe in the spring of 1987. A video recording of one of his last public recitals, Horowitz in Vienna, was released in 1991. His final recital, in Hamburg, Germany, took place on June 21, 1987. He continued to record for the remainder of his life.\n\nVladimir Horowitz died on November 5, 1989 in New York of a heart attack, aged 86. He was buried in the Toscanini family tomb in the Cimitero Monumentale, Milan, Italy.\n\nHorowitz is best known for his performances of the Romantic piano repertoire. Many consider Horowitz's first recording of the Liszt Sonata in 1932 to be the definitive reading of that piece, after over 75 years and over 100 performances committed to disc by other pianists. Other pieces with which he was closely associated were Scriabin's Étude in D-sharp minor, Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G minor, and many Rachmaninoff miniatures, including Polka de W.R.. Horowitz was acclaimed for his recordings of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, and his performance before Rachmaninoff awed the composer, who proclaimed \"he swallowed it whole. He had the courage, the intensity, the daring.\" Horowitz was known for his performances of quieter, more intimate works, including Schumann's Kinderszenen, Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas, keyboard sonatas by Clementi and several Mozart and Haydn sonatas.
