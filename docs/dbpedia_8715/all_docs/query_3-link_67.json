The College’s ideal location – just 15 minutes from Virginia’s General Assembly and a 90-minute train ride to Washington D.C. – gives students a firm footing in the core concepts of political science, and unique internship, research, and hands-on learning opportunities in a specialization of their choosing: American politics; international relations; foreign and comparative politics; and political theory in the ideal campus setting. An RMC political science degree provides you with a strong foundation for careers in law, public administration, election campaigns, social justice, and public service.\n\nJordon Mpingo ’16\n\nProgram Specialist, Scholastic Competitions Program\n\nUnited States Institute of Peace\n\n“My time at Randolph-Macon was an enriching experience that propelled me forward after graduation. Through participating in various organizations including Greek Life, I’ve made lifelong connections which have been both personally and professionally rewarding. My professors utilized their wealth of knowledge and expertise to design excellent course material around relevant topics and current issues in the world, all of which prepared me for my career in international affairs. The career center and my professors supported me and were instrumental in helping me obtain various internships, allowing me to apply what I learned in class to real-world settings and gain hands-on experience.”\n\nTy Mills ’22\n\nStaff Assistant\n\nUS House of Representatives\n\nHannalore Witt Taylor ’17\n\nCorporate Counsel\n\nToshiba Global Commerce Solutions\n\nCHAD RYERSON ’05\n\nDeputy Cadre Coordinator (Environmental Planning & Historic Preservation Cadre – Readiness Branch)\n\nFEMA\n\nAntonia Douglas ’18\n\nAssociate Attorney\n\nTroutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP\n\nCurtis Ellis ’04\n\nDean, College of Arts & Cultural Studies and Professor, Political Science\n\nOral Roberts University"
