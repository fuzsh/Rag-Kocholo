        "text": "I admire the technique and I do admire where Nick Park’s coming from. But I think we tell stories in different ways. His films are much more commercial and marketable and merchandisable, whereas I don’t think my little characters who’ve got cerebral palsy can be turned into McHappy meals.\n\nWhat’s the role of editing in animation? I imagine everything would be thoroughly worked out beforehand, so that an editor wouldn’t have much to do.\n\nGenerally when animators give their films to editors there’s not much to edit – they rarely waste a frame. But I’m one of those weirdo animators who like to shoot the scene from two different angles with an extra five to 10 seconds either side. Bill Murphy edited Harvie: he’s from a live action background, he edited Romper Stomper for example, and this is his first animation. He thought he’d be able to edit the film in three days. It took weeks, but he loved the fact he had things to play with: he could swap shots around, and he could extend shots.\n\nThe wheels of those wheelchairs were pilfered from shopping-trolleys. The character models themselves are the size of a wine bottle, and their arms are made from plasticine, the head and torso from car bog – the pink stuff panel beaters use – and the sets from wood. Claymation is an absolutely fascinating discipline. Elliot says that when Harvie Krumpet was being made, on a typical day he’d only get three to five seconds footage per day. Some days he’d get one whole minute – if the shot was static, he could just let the camera roll over. It’s certainly an intensive process: Harviecontained 280 shots in 23 minutes, as many, Elliot says, as a lot of feature films (he also tells me that during the shoot he went “stir crazy” and talked to his models).\n\nHarvie Krumpetwas in production for a long time.\n\nYes. It took 14 months to shoot and post-production was another four months. Before that, it took around two years to get the finance to make it. And then it took me three months to write it. I’m a very slow writer and I do a lot of drafts, so I took out a huge bank loan and just locked myself away for three months. I did 17 drafts of a 28-page script.Harvie Krumpettook a lot longer to write than anything else I’d done, because there was so much I wanted to tell about this character. Just with all the facts and trying to get everything accurate: researching Poland and the language and so on.\n\nHarvie Krumpet (2003; dir. Adam Elliot).\n\nIt’s interesting that shorts don’t make money. Audiences really want to see them – you only have to look at the popularity of short-film festivals – but the marketing people just don’t seem to know how to handle them.\n\nI had a meeting with the VCA the other day and they had some Federal MPs there from Canberra. These MPs wondered why shorts aren’t shown before feature films. I said, “Well, why don’t you pass a law that there has to be shorts before features?” And they said, “That can quite easily be done”. But at the end of the day you’re up against Coca Cola and other advertisers: a Coca Cola ad makes more money. It’s such a shame because every feature director has cut their teeth making a short.\n\nBrother (1999; dir. Adam Elliot).\n\nHas knocking them dead at Annecy led to further opportunities?\n\nAt Annecy, a major distributor snapped up Harvie Krumpet , after two or three were in the running. But winning mainly means we get into more film festivals: we’ll now be invited to screen as opposed to having to submit (and we’ll save a fortune in courier costs). When I first started making shorts, I thought that winning a prize meant that someone would give me a cheque to fund my next film. But it never happens like that. Even if we get nominated for an Oscar, it doesn’t really make life easier. It opens doors a little but you still have to push your way through.\n\nYou speak highly of your producer, Melanie Coombs. What’s the value of a good producer?\n\nMelanie is everything I’m not. She’s very good at putting budgets together and predicting how much a film will cost. She supports me on every level of the process. So often a director gets all the attention, but what I do is a real partnership with Melanie. She’s been with me right from the beginning of Harvie Krumpet, although she approached me back when Cousin came out. She said if I wanted to do a longer format, she’d be really interested in producing – not for any commercial reason, but purely because she’s in love with the art form.\n\nGiven the time frames involved, I wondered if Elliot had it in to him to make a feature-length claymation. The answer is “yes”: he once reckoned half an hour was impossible but now he’s achieved that, a feature is looking do-able, although there are huge costs involved (Elliot estimates that it would cost anywhere between 10 and 80 million dollars to make). For the moment he’s happy to do shorts, reasoning that if they can move an audience then he’s happy.\n\nHarvie Krumpet’s fully realised soundtrack is a notable departure from your trilogy, which had no music, just ambient sounds and narration. How did that aesthetic change?\n\nEarly on, I really wanted to concentrate on the animation. I wanted to convince myself – and the audience – that you can drive a film with just narration and imagery. My characters rarely speak, so really I was experimenting. But there’s two or three classical music pieces that I just love and when it came to Harvie, I thought I’d see if I can do an amalgamation of music, narration and imagery – with a little bit of lip sync. There’s one song in there, “God is Better than Football, God is Better than Beer”, which is an old Sunday-school song. A friend of mine used to sing it, and he didn’t know all the words to it; it took us months to actually find out who wrote the song and how to get the rights to it. It’s by this guy, Keith Binns – he writes songs about God.\n\nIs it fair to say there’s an old-world aesthetic running through your films?\n\nYeah. I use a very old Bolex camera and I like to think I’m making films the same way they did fifty years ago. The technique is exactly the same. We do use a video-assist camera linked to a laptop, just to see what we’re doing. But it’s still done the traditional way, and audiences like that. The proof’s in Chicken Run and the new Wallace & Gromit feature that’s coming out in a couple of years. Audiences like to see fingerprints on the plasticine – it proves that what they’re seeing is tangible.\n\nHarvie Krumpet (2003; dir. Adam Elliot).\n\nHow did Geoffrey Rush and Kamahl come on board for Harvie Krumpet?\n\nI’d used William McInnes as narrator for my first three films, but withHarvie I thought I should try and use different actors. Melanie wondered who would be my dream narrator. At the time I was thinking of Ruth Cracknell, but she died, unfortunately. But I really loved Shine, and I’d seen Geoffrey Rush in other films: he has that universal timbre to his voice, not too English and not too American or Australian. There seems to be an honesty and integrity to his voice. So it was quite simple: we approached him, showed him the trilogy and he loved it. He read the script for Harvie Krumpet and took to it immediately. And Kamahl was easy: we just rang him up and said Geoffrey Rush was involved, and he said, “I’ll do it”.\n\nAside from the soundtrack, all your films seem to have a unified style. How do you see Harvie Krumpet in relation to the trilogy?\n\nLooking at it now, I reckon Harvie is too colourful. I think the next film I make will be a return to monotone or sepia. Harvie is a lot more detailed than I anticipated. I really like the crudeness of Uncle, Cousinand Brother, but since it was a commercial half hour for TV, I felt thatHarvie had to be more dynamic and colourful. I think I went a little bit overboard, but that’s just me. Most people would disagree.\n\nIt’s a busy time for Elliot. He’s just been to LA to push forHarvie Krumpet ‘s nomination for an Oscar, and he’s writing a claymation series, Urban Eccentrics, for SBS. As he’s a “very slow” writer, he probably won’t finish this for a good while yet. He’s also just finished a kids’ book, The A to Z of Monsters (which took him eight years to write) but he’s not sure what to do with it. It might turn up as an animated series first and then a book.\n\nIsn’t your style a little dark for kids?\n\nI keep forgetting how sophisticated kids are these days. The other night I saw Pirates of the Caribbean and this little girl next to me said she only shut her eyes once. And I thought that film was very scary!"
