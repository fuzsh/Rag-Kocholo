        "text": "I graduated in 2018 from Penn State Altoona with a B.S. in Psychology. I received my M.S. in Counselor Education from Duquesne University in 2023. Like many, I struggled with mental health which led me to this field. This started in high school and my set of challenges followed me into college. Feeling outcast and lonely, I sought peace through means that had become more unhelpful than anything else.\n\nLearning about depression, anxiety, and addiction I found was not enough for me to help myself, and I had to seek outside help. I learned that the power found in a healing and growth-fostering relationship with another, whether that is a counselor, friend, or family, was crucial in working toward becoming the person I want to be and beginning a healing journey.\n\nI work from a Person-Centered approach and incorporate mindfulness and addiction recovery principles. I think that counseling relationships can provide many with a wonderful opportunity to work through our thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a way that both is and feels safe. I am also trained in EMDR and work with trauma, addiction, depression, anxiety, and neurodivergence.\n\nI have worked in several settings, including community mental health, addiction, and in-home work with families. Each of these has provided me with some beneficial experiences with mental health. Throughout my time in each of these settings, what I have learned is crucial in beginning any journey is, starting from a place of safety. If someone does not feel safe, for one reason or another, itâ€™s difficult to start that journey and work on the goals that you want to work on. My goal with anyone I work with is to create and maintain that safe space that allows us to grow!"
