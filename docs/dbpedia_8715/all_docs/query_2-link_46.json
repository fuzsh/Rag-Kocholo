        "text": "Christopher Kapessa – a young black boy subjected to violent racist bullying, has lost his life at the hands of his tormentors.\n\nHe is being failed by our racist police system, and needs the help of the community for both his family to get justice, and to help ensure others don’t have to endure the same racist violence.\n\nSpeakers included:\n\no Alina Joseph, Christopher’s mother\n\no Faith Walker, friend of the family\n\no Beth Winter, MP for Cynon Valley\n\no Bell Ribeiro-Addy, MP for Streatham\n\no Shavanah Taj, Wales TUC Acting Gen Sec\n\no Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT Gen Sec\n\no Imran Khan QC, Human Rights lawyer\n\no Dr Adam Elliot Cooper, BLM UK\n\nJoin us as we speak to an expert panel about policing in the black community.\n\nThis event provides an opportunity to examine the impact and role of policing in the black community, plus discuss some of the reforms that may help improve the situation.\n\nPlease register for the event here\n\nSpeakers will include:\n\n1) Dr. Leroy Logan MBE; Former Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police; Author of ‘Closing Ranks, My Life as a Cop\n\n2) Dr. Adam Elliott-Cooper, BLM UK\n\n3) Ms. Temi Mwale, Founding Director of The 4Front Project\n\n4) Mr. Lee Lawrence, Chair of the Cherry Groce Foundation and Author of ‘The Louder I will Sing’\n\nCan the police be reformed?\n\nFrom Mohamud, to @freesiyanda, to Stephen Lawrence, to George Floyd, to #EndSARS, and to the countless more innocent Black lives, the police have continuously shown themselves to be institutionally racist, violent, and ineffective.\n\nUntil now, the mainstream argument in response to blatant police racism has been reform. More body cams, more unconscious bias training – but does this actually work? Year after year of more funding, more training, the disproportionate levels of stop and searches, tasering, and deaths in custody remain. Do we then need a more radical solution? Do we need to defund and abolish the police?"
