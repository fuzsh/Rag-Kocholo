        "text": "Acclaimed Australian stop-motion animation writer and director Adam Elliot, creator of Oscar-winning short Harvie Krumpet and hit animated feature Mary & Max, will attend this year’s Bradford Animation Festival to take part in a screentalk with fellow stop motion animator Barry Purves. The festival runs November 12-16 at The National Media Museum in Bradford, West Yorkshire.\n\nElliot‘s five films have collectively participated in over 700 film festivals, receiving more than 100 awards. His screentalk will focus on his career, influences and inspirations, featuring screenings of his Oscar-winning short film Harvie Krumpet, a rare opportunity to see his triology Brother, Uncle and Cousin, back to back, followed by his feature film Mary and Max, which was awarded top industry honor, the Annecy Cristal in 2009.\n\nComedian, writer and actor Adam Buxton returns to the National Media Museum to host an exclusive festival edition of his acclaimed show BUG at BAF 2013 on Thursday 14th November. Tickets are on sale starting September 4 for this brand new presentation of the BFI’s stand-out live comedy and music video show, following a sell-out performance at the Bradford International Film Festival 2013 in April. BUG promises a set of awe-inspiring animated music videos and astounding online nuggets. This unique show for BAF 2013 will also feature a live interview with British animation superstar, Cyriak Harris. Cyriak began spreading his surreal animations across the internet in 2004. Commissions have included music videos, viral campaigns, TV adverts, titles and channel idents, with clients ranging from Coca Cola to the BBC.\n\nAdditional headline guests announced include world renowned comic book artist, illustrator, graphic designer, filmmaker and animator Dave McKean, conceptual artist on two Harry Potter films and leading contemporary female animator Michaela Pavlatova, winner of the Golden Bear in Berlin for her film Repete and OSCAR nominee for Words, Words, Words.\n\nWatch Harvie Krumpet, below:\n\n‘’We’re delighted to be celebrating our 20th BAF birthday this November with such a fantastic & varied line up of screenings and guests, including globally renowned animators from as far away as Australia and the US,” said Bradford Animation Festival director Deb Singleton. “We will be delving into all aspects of the creative process at this year’s festival, revealing the very latest cutting edge techniques in masterclasses suitable for professional animators and students, along with retrospectives and practical workshops aimed at younger animation fans. We’ll also be screening 124 short films in competition and panorama from 29 different countries, along with some of the most acclaimed feature animations to delight audiences of all ages.’’\n\nVisionary UK artist and filmmaker Dave McKean will demonstrate his work and creative achievement as a globally acclaimed comic book artist, illustrator, graphic designer, filmmaker and animator. A frequent collaborator with writer Neil Gaiman, McKean has brought his distinctive vision to a range of fields, illustrating Gaiman’s Violent Cases, Black Orchid, The Sandman, Signal to Noise and Mr Punch, as well as the children’s picture books, The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish and The Wolves in the Walls. His own celebrated graphic narrative, Cages, addresses the creative process itself. His feature films include Mirrormask and Luna.\n\nMcKean has also worked as a conceptual artist on two Harry Potter movies; Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban & Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, produced books of photography, book covers and album sleeve art, and has proven adept in all aspects of visualization. His work is striking, original and highly influential in the contemporary era.\n\nWidely recognised as one of the leading contemporary women animators, Czech director Michaela Pavlatova joins BAF 2013 for a masterclass and selective retrospective. Her films, often dealing with relationships and using ironic black humor, have won many prizes in festivals around the world, including an Oscar nomination for Words, Words, Words and the Golden Bear in Berlin for Repete. Her latest short film Tram was awarded the Annecy Cristal in 2012 and screened in competition at BAF 2012. She teaches animation abroad (San Francisco, Harvard) as well as in her hometown Prague (VSUP, FAMU).\n\nThe BAF 2013 ident and animated sting has been created by Oscar-nominated and BAFTA award winning British animator Joanna Quinn. One of the world’s leading female animators. The ident features her signature character Beryl who has appeared in three of Joanna’s films: Girls Night Out, Body Beautiful and Dreams and Desires – Family Ties and an array of iconic animated characters. The BAF 2013 Ident will be revealed when our program goes live on Tuesday 17 September with the animated sting premiering at BAF on November 12.\n\nBAF Game 2013 takes place as part of the Bradford Animation Festival this year November 12 & 13.
