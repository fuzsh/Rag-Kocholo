        "text": "Matt Ellis\n\nPrincipal\n\nBoston College, B.A.; Lehman College, M.S.; Baruch College, M.Ed\n\nMatt brings over 18 years of New York City education experience to Clinton Hill as the school principal. He started his career as a New York City Teaching Fellow, teaching 10th grade English at a high school in the Bronx for six years. From there he worked at the nonprofit Futures and Options, supporting high school students around the city as they started internships at various companies, before joining Prospect Schools in 2013. Matt worked for six years as the Director of School Culture at BPCS High School before serving two years as Principal in Residence at Clinton Hill Middle School, with a six-month stint as interim principal in the Spring of 2020.\n\nHe has always been a committed lifelong student, earning two Master’s degrees for education from Lehman College and Baruch College, completing two year-long principal training programs through The New Teacher Project and Relay Graduate School of Education, and earning his New York State school building leadership certification through St. Joseph’s College.\n\nThroughout his career Matt has always believed in a holistic approach to educating students, getting to know them as individuals and finding ways to spark their passion. Over the years he has accomplished this through service trips with students, coaching basketball and softball, empowering interns to be successful, and focusing on getting to know each student in his classroom. Matt is excited to bring this focus on developing the whole child to Clinton Hill MS, making sure all students feel cared for and known while achieving academic success at the highest level."
