He plans to incorporate archaeology and material culture into his Latin curriculum at Mirman and make much use of the ancient collection housed in the Getty Villa here in Los Angeles. Having been born and raised in the mountains of Colorado, Adam enjoys the great outdoors. He looks forward to exploring the mountains of California by hike and the city of Los Angeles by bike, scouting for taco trucks.\n\nJeff Maynard has taught at Mirman School since 1999.
