This foundational skills course is geared toward students looking to develop data skills using Tableau. Students will work hands-on with Tableau (free Academic License) to analyze several datasets and create various types of visualizations. Along the way, students will be challenged to think about how their visualizations can be improved to communicate their ideas and findings more clearly. While the course is meant to be a gentle introduction to Tableau, even students who already have some experience in Tableau will find the course rewarding. Not only will this course help you build the necessary skills for evidence-based policy formulation, but it will also make you more marketable. Tableau and data communication skills are in high demand among employers and can help set you apart in your professional career.\n\nIAFF 6505 Expert Foreign Policy Decision-Making Using Data (July 2024)\n\nLevel: Beginner\n\nPerfect for: Beginners who have never coded in R before, but are looking for low-stakes, hands-on, guided instruction.
