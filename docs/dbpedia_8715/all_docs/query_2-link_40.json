        "text": "Bulldogs players have reportedly communicated to club officials they want Adam Elliott seriously disciplined or even sacked as the NRL hands down its fine for the 26-year-old.\n\nElliott was on Thursday fined $10,000 by the governing body for “bringing the game into disrepute and failing to comply with biosecurity protocols.”\n\nThe breach notice also proposed he complete education and training, while also confirming that his “off-field disciplinary record” was taken into account.\n\nElliott’s future with the Bulldogs continues to hang in the balance days after it first emerged he had shared an “innocent kiss” with Millie Boyle — which has been confirmed by the Brisbane Broncos NRLW star.\n\nThe NRL issued Boyle with a warning. NRLW players are currently not subject to biosecurity protocols.\n\nOn Monday, Canterbury confirmed it was co-operating with the NRL Integrity Unit regarding an investigation into Elliott being asked to leave a Gold Coast restaurant on Sunday afternoon.\n\nManagement at the venue asked Elliott to leave after he was discovered in the men’s bathroom with Boyle.\n\nThe Telegraph’s Michael Carayannis has backed up earlier reports the Bulldogs will look to terminate Elliott’s contract if the incident is serious enough to warrant another breach of contract notice.\n\nThe race to the 2021 NRL Telstra Finals Series is on and every game matters.

The Adam Elliott matter will be dealt with once NRL Integrity concludes it’s investigation.\n\n“That’s the first step here. Let’s see how that unfolds.”\n\nGould also said on Channel 9’s 100% Footy that sacking Elliott was an option, depending on the NRL integrity unit’s findings.\n\n“In Adam’s case, and what I tried to explain to Adam, while you think this might not be a major issue, it is actually because it allows the media to regurgitate all that stuff, and that’s apart from ‘what the hell were you thinking anyway’ and ‘why did you put yourself and get yourself into this position’,” Gould said.\n\n“You may think that it’s only a minor issue but it’s actually not and they’ve got to learn to understand why that happens.\n\n“In isolation sometimes they’re not major issues but they accumulate over time and sponsors and members and fans and, as I say, staff, everyone starts to get worn by it and tired by it and when it’s the same culprits all the time, that’s when they start to get intolerant of it, to be honest.”\n\nElliott has undergone alcohol counselling this year after an incident in the pre-season involving former teammate Michael Lichaa and Lichaa’s fiancee. Lichaa reportedly caught the back-rower kissing his partner.\n\nIn 2018, Elliott was fined $25,000 when he and teammate Asipeli Fine were charged with wilful and obscene exposure during the Bulldogs’ Mad Monday celebrations.\n\nAfter suffering a season-ending shoulder injury midway through 2020, Elliott has returned to the fray this year and retained his regular spot in the Bulldogs’ best 17. He has made 18 appearances this season and played his 100th NRL game against the Warriors in round 22.\n\nElliott will miss the Bulldogs’ upcoming clashes with the Sea Eagles and Tigers, but neither match will influence his side’s final ladder position.\n\nHaving won only two games for the season, the Bulldogs have been consigned to their first 16th-placed finish since 2008."
