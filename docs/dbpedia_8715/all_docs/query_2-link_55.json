        "text": "Vision Statement\n\nBasic Training is the mechanism through which those entering the law enforcement profession are trained and prepared to serve the citizens of the State of New Mexico and safeguard the stability of our society.\n\nTo this end, we look to the future, embracing new technologies, seeking best practices within the global law enforcement training community, and developing state of the art training in both content and methods of delivery. We set the bar high and expect those we are entrusted to train to strive to meet or exceed our high standards. We also set those standards for ourselves and expect no less of ourselves as we lead by example.\n\n\n\nRead more about our goals and objectives here\n\nApplication Process\n\nCompleted applications must be received 14 business days prior to the advertised start date of a given class.

The training must be given by a trainer certified* to teach CPR and first aid. This certification must be received by the Academy as part of their application for admission and certification, at minimum, two weeks prior to the scheduled class start date.\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n* Schedules were current at the starting date of each BPOT class, however adjustments are made on an ongoing basis.

Please refer to the BPOT Entrance Fitness Requirements for the entry standards. These standards were adopted by the NMLEA Board on September 3, 2014 and supersede previous standards for academies which have not conducted mandatory assessments or begun classes prior to September 3, 2014.\n\nClass Size\n\nEach Basic Police Officer Training (BPOT) Academy Class size is limited to 60 students.\n\nApplication Process\n\nThe Basic Training Bureau will process applications on a first come first served basis.

Academy staff will then fill any vacancies from the eligible-to-attend waiting list with the first available applicant who submitted a complete application package and passed the mandatory assessment.\n\nIncomplete Applications\n\nIncomplete applications will be returned to the agency and may cause a delay in enrolling students in the training programs.\n\nComplete Application Due Date\n\nA COMPLETE application package MUST have been received by and reviewed by the Basic Training Bureau by 8:00 a.m. on the day before the mandatory assessment.

The student in need of remedial training will be scheduled and notified of said training with the cost of the training being billed to the student’s agency. Occasionally, remedial training is scheduled during the student’s scheduled academy training if staff, facilities, and time are available. If this approach is used, it could result in student and staff overtime.\n\nEvents Calendar\n\nOctober 2024\n\nALICE Active Shooter Response Training\n\nThursday, Isleta Elementary School\n\nNo event found!"
