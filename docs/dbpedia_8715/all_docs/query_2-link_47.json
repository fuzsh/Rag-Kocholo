        "text": "Bulldogs player Adam Elliott’s career is hanging by a thread after he was fined by the NRL following his toilet tryst with NRLW star Millie Boyle last weekend.\n\nOn Monday, Canterbury confirmed it was co-operating with the NRL Integrity Unit regarding an investigation into Elliott being asked to leave Gold Coast restaurant White Rhino on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe race to the 2021 NRL Telstra Finals Series is on and every game matters.

They’ll get to outline their options, obviously sacking him or fining him and he’ll be given the chance to front the board most likely in just after a week to argue why he shouldn’t have his contract torn up,” Read told Triple M on Saturday.\n\n“It looks like the club is heading down the path of trying to terminate his deal and Adam will have to try and convince them not to do that.\n\n“They’re a club that’s not winning footy games and from the outside looking in, it looks dysfunctional, it looks as though the club is not making headway. Something’s got to give and unfortunately he’s going to be the something that has to give.\n\n“My gut feeling is yeah (he will be let go).”\n\nIt comes after it emerged earlier this week venue management asked Elliott to leave after he was discovered in the men’s bathroom with Boyle, where they reportedly shared a kiss.\n\nFurther details have now leaked out to reveal details of the dalliance, including Elliott being escorted onto the street without a shirt on.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reports an employee had to retrieve a key to unlock the toilet cubicle door so security could escort a shirtless Elliott out of the venue.\n\nElliott and Boyle allegedly locked themselves in the toilet and when an employee knocked on the door of the cubicle, they didn’t get a response.\n\nBoyle told The Daily Telegraph earlier this week: “Look, all we did was have a kiss in the bathroom. It’s been taken way out of context. It’s a big kerfuffle about nothing.”\n\nThe back-rower was stood down by the Bulldogs for the remainder of the season and has now been slapped with a breach notice and a $10,000 fine by the NRL for “bringing the game into disrepute and failing to comply with biosecurity protocols”.\n\nMORE NRL NEWS\n\nBIG BUNNIES BLOW: Latrell whacked with monster ban as Souths’ title hopes ruined\n\nCLASHING COACHES: Bennett exposes Roosters’ own problems after Latrell drama\n\n‘FARCE’: Robbo slams bunker in all-time rant after Latrell’s dog shot\n\nBoyle, who plays for the Brisbane Broncos in the NRLW, has been issued with a warning for her role in the incident and will be given education and training regarding the obligations of players in public.\n\nBut Elliott has greater concerns than the fine, with the Bulldogs said to be seriously considering handing their own breach notice and sacking the 26-year-old, who has two years left to run on his $1 million deal.\n\nWatch ‘Wild Wests: Tales from Tiger Town’ an exclusive Fox League behind-the-scenes production on demand on Kayo > Click here to watch\n\nElliott faces a nervous few days, with the Bulldogs expected to make a call on his future by the end of the weekend.\n\nCanterbury is believed to be under considerable salary cap pressure after signing the likes of Josh Addo-Carr, Tevita Pangai Jr, Matt Burton, Paul Vaughan this year.\n\nElliott’s manager David Riolo hopes the club doesn’t use his client’s latest misdemeanour as an excuse to sack him just to create more room in the salary cap.\n\n“I just hope this hasn’t been beaten up and some sort of attempt to have a player dismissed so it helps create some cap space for the club,” Riolo told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nElliott has undergone alcohol counselling this year after an incident in the pre-season involving former teammate Michael Lichaa and Lichaa’s fiancee. Lichaa reportedly caught the back-rower kissing his partner.\n\nGet all the latest NRL news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail.

He has made 18 appearances this season and played his 100th NRL game against the Warriors in round 22.\n\nElliott will miss the Bulldogs’ upcoming clashes with the Sea Eagles and Tigers, but neither match will influence his side’s final ladder position.\n\nHaving won only two games for the season, the Bulldogs have been consigned to their first 16th-placed finish since 2008."
