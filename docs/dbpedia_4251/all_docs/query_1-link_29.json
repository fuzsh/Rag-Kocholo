        "text": "Rusnano has got $7.5bn invested in technology companies. It has been going for five years and hopes to see the first IPOs or trade sales of its portfolio companies this year.\n\nRusnano’s capital came half from the Russian government and half from debt. The move signals that the Russian government does not want to put any more money into the fund.\n\nRusnano has backed 140 companies directly, of which 12 are American, and has backed more companies through a variety of subsidiary funds to the tune of $1bn.\n\nRusnano is looking for any kind of investor – development fund, private investor, industrial company, sovereign wealth fund, other VC funds, private equity funds etc.\n\nRussian attempts to spawn a Silicon Valley-style high-tech industry go back 50 years to when two renegades from the Valley, Joel Barr and Alfred Sarant, persuaded Soviet President Nikita Kruschev that he needed a Silicon Valley in Russia.\n\nSo Kruschev set up Zelenograd about 40 kilometres outside Moscow and populated it with some 10,000 PhDs.\n\nBut, unlike Silicon Valley, no earth-shattering companies were spawned there.\n\nThe question mark over such initiatives is whether the barren soil of an authoritarian autocracy can spawn the kind of free-thinking individualism which bred Silicon Valley."
