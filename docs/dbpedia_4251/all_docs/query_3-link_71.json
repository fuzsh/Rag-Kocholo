        "text": "MOSCOW, April 11. /TASS/. Russia has lost a unique global product due to the transfer of its production assets and intellectual property abroad by OCSiAl (a portfolio company of Rusnano), Deputy General Director, member of the board of the Rusnano group Dmitry Tarasov said in an interview with TASS.\n\n\"The parent company of the world-famous holding is currently domiciled in Luxembourg, its shareholders carefully avoid connections with Russia, trying to restart production abroad on the Russian intellectual and technical base. First, some of the unique equipment was removed from Russia, now all production assets and R&D have been transferred outside the perimeter of the company in which Rusnano has a stake. That is, a unique product on a global scale is deprived of Russian origin, and moreover Russia has lost the asset itself. The competent authorities are already dealing with this problem, and we are intensively helping them,\" he said.\n\nThe OCSiAl company was established by scientists from Novosibirsk and has gradually grown into the world's largest manufacturer of single-walled carbon nanotubes since the mid-2010s. In 2022, the company accounted for about 90% of the global market for these products.\n\nOCSiAl is represented in Russia, Luxembourg, USA, Korea, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Israel, India, Mexico, Australia and Germany. OCSiAl is the first among Rusnano's portfolio assets to be a so-called unicorn company, which means that it has received a market valuation of over $1 billion.\n\nRusnano includes the joint stock company Rusnano, the limited liability company Management Company Rusnano. Thanks to Rusnano's investments, 138 enterprises and research centers operate in 37 regions of Russia."
