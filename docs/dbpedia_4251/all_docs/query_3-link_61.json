        "text": "RUSNANO and the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) plan to work together for implementing projects in various spheres of renewable and clean energy including green hydrogen as well as other high-tech sectors in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). An agreement to this effect has been signed recently. Under this collaboration, EDB will finance a new alternative energy fund that is being set up by RUSNANO. This clean energy fund will finance renewable energy projects in the region.\n\nThe investments made by this fund will not be limited to only the Russian Federation but will also include Kazakhstan and other EAEU nations. Further, the various terms and conditions under which EDB will finance these projects and promote the development of high-tech companies have also been decided.\n\nEstablished in January 2006, EDB is an international financial institution established to promote economic growth and support integration of its member states, i.e. Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan. Its headquarters are located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and it aims to support projects that promote integration in spheres of transport infrastructure, digitalization, renewable energy, agriculture, manufacturing and engineering.\n\nThe RUSNANO Group includes the RUSNANO Joint Stock Company, the RUSNANO Management Company and the Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs. As part of RUSNANOâ€™s investments, there are currently 138 factories and R&D Centers opened in 37 regions in Russia."
