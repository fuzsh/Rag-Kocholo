        "text": "Co-operation aims to promote growth and listings on both exchanges\n\nMOSCOW and NEW YORK, October 21, 2013 - NASDAQ OMX (NDAQ) and Moscow Exchange (MOEX) today announced the signing of a co-operation agreement. Within this agreement both exchanges will work jointly in further developing the Russian technology and biotechnology community. The aim of the co-operation is to jointly facilitate access to capital for the fast growing Russian start-up community and to promote listings at both exchanges.\n\nIn 2009 Moscow Exchange and RUSNANO created a listing platform for young and promising non-commodity companies called the \"Innovations and Investment Market of Moscow Exchange\". RUSNANO was set up in 2007 with a mission to develop Russia's nanotechnology industry through co-investing in nanotechnology projects that offer substantial economic potential or social benefit.\n\n\"There are a lot of interesting technology companies emerging from Russia, in combination with a strong interest from global issuers and investors to become more involved with this community,\" said Bruce Aust, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Listings at NASDAQ OMX. \"We have supported some of the new, leading and fast growing Russian technology companies in raising capital, like CTC Media, QIWI and Yandex, who we are proud to have listed with us. We truly look forward to being a part of the new Russian technology companies\" development and support them with the best possible foundation to raise capital in Russia and globally.\"\n\nWithin the scope of the co-operation, the two exchanges will jointly organize conferences, workshops and presentations for innovative companies and international investors.\n\n\"Moscow Exchange is happy to partner with RUSNANO and NASDAQ OMX to identify future technology leaders and promote flotations on both exchanges. We see growing interest to invest into technology stocks from the Russian investment community. I hope this new co-operation agreement will help to create a roadmap for start-ups to raise capital to support their growth,\" said Alexander Afanasiev, CEO of Moscow Exchange.\n\n\"RUSNANO\"s partnership with NASDAQ OMX is part of our efforts to strengthen the links between Russia\"s startup entrepreneurs and the global VC community,\" said Head of Coordination council of Innovation and Investment Market of Moscow Exchange, Chairman of the Rusnano Executive Board Anatoly Chubais. \"We believe that NASDAQ OMX\"s heritage and brand can give Russian tech companies greater reach and visibility to the global technology investor community.\"\n\nAbout Rusnano\n\nRUSNANO was founded in March 2011 as an open joint stock company through reorganization of state corporation Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies. RUSNANO's mission is to develop the Russian nanotechnology industry through co-investment in nanotechnology projects with substantial economic potential or social benefit. The Government of the Russian Federation owns 100 percent of the shares in RUSNANO. Anatoly Chubais is CEO and chairman of the Executive Board of RUSNANO.\n\nWork to establish nanotechnology infrastructure and training for nanotechnology specialists, formerly conducted by the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies, has been entrusted to the Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs, a non-commercial fund also established through reorganization of the Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies.\n\nAbout Moscow Exchange\n\nMoscow Exchange Group manages the sole multifunctional exchange platform in Russia for shares, bonds, derivative instruments, currencies, money market instruments, and commodities. The Group includes the central depository (National Settlement Depository), and a clearing center (National Clearing Centre), performing the functions of central counterparty on the markets, which allows Moscow Exchange to render the full spectrum of trading and post-trading services to its clients.\n\nMoscow Exchange ranks among the world\"s top 20 exchanges by total capitalization of securities traded, and also among the 10 largest exchange platforms by bonds and derivatives trading. Securities of 709 issuers are admitted to trading on the stock market of Moscow Exchange, including securities of the largest Russian companies by level of market capitalization.\n\nMoscow Exchange was formed in December 2011 as a result of a merger between Russia\"s two main exchange groups - MICEX Group, the oldest domestic exchange and operator of the leading securities, foreign exchange and money market platform in Russia, and the RTS Group, at the time the operator of Russia\"s leading derivatives market. This combination created a vertically integrated public trading market across most major asset classes, which was reorganized into an open joint stock company (OJSC) and was named Moscow Exchange. Moscow Exchange held the initial public offering of its shares on 15 February 2013 (ticker MOEX).\n\nAbout NASDAQ OMX\n\nThe inventor and transformer of the electronic exchange, The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc., fuels economies with revolutionary technologies for the entire lifecycle of a trade - from risk management to trade to surveillance to clearing.
