        "text": "Extensive Scientific Capabilities of the United States and Russia\n\nMany tens of thousands of scientists and members of their support staffs in both the United States and Russia, with ages ranging from the early twenties to the eighties, are engaged in (a) carrying out research activities in a number of subfields of biology and (b) promoting applications of biological and biotechnology advances at home and abroad. Skilled scientists in the two countries account for an estimated 20 percent of the world's highly trained specialists involved in activities linked to the life sciences.3 Of course, with the rapid growth of the high-skill labor pools in India and China, the percentage will decline. However, for the next decade, the number of experienced life scientists and skilled young investigators in the two countries will continue to be a significant portion of worldwide capabilities.\n\nReflecting the importance of the life sciences, a large percentage of the global scientific work force, including both researchers and service providers, is involved in advancing the biological sciences and biotechnology. They assist in protecting human health, increasing the food supply, developing new energy sources, and enhancing the quality of the environment. The intensity of international interest in advances in the biological sciences and biotechnology, which address the very basis of life, continues to rise. At the same time, many countries are becoming more deeply immersed than ever before in interdisciplinary approaches that attract increased attention of specialists in a variety of fields, which intersect with biology—e.g., physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, engineering, and bioinformatics. Adequate recognition of this convergence of various disciplines is important for designing and carrying out research in both countries, and particularly in Russia. There, the physical sciences have for decades been the greatest strengths of the scientific enterprise, but too often they have been somewhat isolated from important biological research efforts.\n\nIn addition to the communities of well-established specialists in biology who will continue their careers in the United States and Russia during the next decade, the number of temporary scientific workers and of advanced students from abroad at U.S. universities, and to a lesser but still significant extent at Russian research centers, is growing. In short, the total efforts focused on moving forward the frontiers of the life sciences in the two countries are extensive. During the next decade, only a handful of countries will have the large number and diversity of biology-oriented scientific institutions that can rival the capabilities of institutions located either in the United States or in Russia.\n\nIn Soviet times, both the United States and Russia devoted significant resources to many areas of the biological sciences that were of international interest. The United States was among the world's leaders in achieving scientific breakthroughs as the nation expanded its portfolios of science-intensive activities. But for decades, the USSR was recovering from the Lysenko era of the late 1940s, when his theory of “inheritance of acquired characteristics” had for a short time become the official dogma.4 Thus, it is not surprising that for many years the scientific productivity of American researchers and the number of articles published in international journals with roots in the United States were much stronger than productivity and publications in the USSR.\n\nThe publications gap has continued in recent years, further aggravated by a brain drain of some of the most productive young Russian scientists, including a significant number who have moved to the United States.5 The gap, in large measure, reflects the inadequate number of active Russian investigators currently in the 40–50 age group. Thus, in the near term, Russian science will gain substantially from bilateral cooperation that provides access to a broader range of specialists.\n\nWhile the overall number of researchers in Russia has stabilized, as indicated in Appendix F.2, the impact of the brain drain is best measured by the quality rather than the quantity of the scientists who have left Russian laboratories. According to a number of Russian laboratory leaders, far too many of the best young researchers have departed for positions in the United States and Europe. However, opportunities for Russia to participate in international projects that involve recognized scientific leaders from abroad has at times been an effective way to encourage outstanding investigators to return to or to remain in Russia.\n\nAmerican researchers also benefit from cooperation. Those who do not regularly scrutinize Russian-language journals and have not been able to assess in detail the scientific methods used in Russia are given the opportunity to fill in many gaps in their understanding of Russian achievements through scientist-to-scientist contacts. In short, while the United States has been the international leader in the biological sciences, Russia has been an action-oriented follower, although some of its achievements have been overlooked by the international community. Unfortunately, the Soviet-era legacy of not involving in joint activities many important Russian specialists who had been isolated from the mainstream of international science still remains in a number of topical areas.\n\nAn exception to U.S. dominance in significant scientific fields has been the extensive investigations of dangerous biological pathogens within the Soviet defense sector during the 1970s and 1980s. In this period, the USSR mounted large and unique programs to explore the capabilities of biological pathogens that might be produced in large quantities. At the end of the 1960s, the United States reduced the size and scope of its defense-related research in compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), which would soon enter into force. Then in the early 1990s, Russia abandoned inappropriate research efforts as it announced its commitment to the BTWC as well.\n\nFrom the earliest days of defense-oriented research, many potential spin-off benefits for civilian science became apparent to scientists in both countries. It was obvious to them that scientists could and should improve understanding of the characteristics of diseases caused by exposure to dangerous pathogens that occurred in nature or could be manipulated in laboratories for destructive purposes. Among the pathogens of interest were those that caused plague, hemorrhagic fevers, and anthrax, which were encountered naturally in some areas of both the United States and Russia.6\n\nThe Russian workforce suffered severe reductions in both quantity and quality of its research and application efforts during the economic crises of the 1990s. Brain drain, equipment obsolescence, loss of respect for science, and low priority for research in Russia took a huge toll in reducing the productivity of the research community. But the country is now slowly returning to a prominent position in a few areas, and U.S.-Russian bioengagement has been a significant factor in this recovery.7\n\nLooking ahead to the next decade, the history of a strong Russian system of higher education, developed largely in the Soviet era, then weakened by the economic crisis of the 1990s, and now supplemented with an increasing emphasis on university-based research, will continue to be of considerable importance. While these universities are becoming stronger, few have kept pace with leading universities in many other countries. The Russian government is expecting substantial payoffs from its large investments in both universities and other research centers as well as in applied biotechnology activities. However, biotechnology hubs should be effectively linked to the research and educational establishment if Russian investors and investigators alike are to work successfully on the frontiers of biotechnology.\n\nAs to the size and strength of the scientific workforce in the many fields related to biology (such as agriculture, health, environment, pharmacy, veterinary science, and bioengineering disciplines), the Russian commitment to producing well-trained specialists in the foreseeable future seems clear. Many industrialized countries will increase their investments and the number of participants in their research programs. However, Russia plays an important and sometimes a unique role in some niche areas of biology of general interest to the global community, including the United States.\n\nBenefits to the United States\n\nThe importance to the United States of a sound bilateral relationship with Russia has been regularly emphasized by senior American government officials, particularly since 2009, when the “reset” of the relationship was highlighted by the secretary of state.9 Bioengagement has been one of the important aspects of this relationship.\n\nAs previously noted, Russia has a large number of experienced scientists, including both researchers and practitioners, often probing a variety of geographical areas to obtain insights on biological conditions and transformations affecting both the residents and the ecological resources that are unique to Russia but are also of interest to the international community. Russian institutions have extensive data banks of scientific interest that are difficult to access and to use efficiently without active collaborative projects. Also, a number of these institutions have traditions of innovative approaches both in the laboratory and in the field. But some of their successful methodological approaches are not well known internationally.\n\nRussian institutions have developed considerable experience in analyzing a wide variety of organisms and ecosystems that are of interest to American investigators but have not been well studied in the United States. For example, Russia has extensive research experience in the fields of forestry, plant science, and soil science, giving particular attention to the characteristics of various ecological zones. Bilateral collaboration encompassing ecological considerations in Russia enables American researchers both (a) to witness firsthand the basis for Russian reports on these organisms and ecosystems and thereby be in better positions to judge the importance and authenticity of relevant Russian publications and (b) to recommend supplemental investigations that augment initial Russian findings, which are of particular importance in providing a global context for investigations of ecological phenomena in the United States.\n\nMany Russian colleagues are interested in participating in bilateral cooperation, often at low costs to the Russian or U.S. financial sponsors of such cooperation. Once Russian investigators interact with American colleagues, they usually devote considerable time and effort to continuing mutually beneficial cooperation through adjustments of their personal research agendas. In general, Russian scientists are noted for being “all in” with joint U.S.-Russian undertakings.\n\nIn applied technologies, Russia is likely to be a growing future market for U.S. biotechnology products as the Russian economy continues to develop, with demands for a wider variety of high-technology medical and agricultural products. The quality of imported drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic systems into Russia from some countries—particularly developing countries where corruption is of concern—has long been questioned by both Russian officials and the general population. Products of well-known U.S. pharmaceutical companies have usually commanded greater respect, particularly products with complicated vaccine and drug formulations. As potential opportunities for profitable U.S.-Russian joint ventures and other types of international investments increase, the reputation of U.S. achievements in biotechnology will continue to command considerable attention within Russia.\n\nBilateral cooperation that is endorsed by the two governments should continue to open otherwise closed doors in Russia. Thus, it is important for security as well as for scientific reasons for U.S. institutions to be engaged in cooperative research and related field activities in Russia. The alternative is to sit on the sidelines speculating on developments within Russia. Such long-distance impressions can result in false alarms within the United States in reacting to uncertain allegations of disease outbreaks, misinterpretations of Russian technical objectives, lack of awareness of existing Russian data that are available, and administrative difficulties in organizing ad hoc visits to obtain snapshot impressions of the quality of activities in research institutes that were once recognized as international leaders.\n\nAs previously noted, Russian scientists do not publish in English-language journals as extensively as scientists of the United States and many other countries. Cooperation often leads to publications, documenting Russian past and current achievements. American scientists can help Russian colleagues overcome their lack of experience in dealing with western publishers and their difficulties in handling the English language. An increase in such publications will provide American researchers with easier access to Russian data that might otherwise remain in inaccessible libraries. (See Appendix F.1 concerning the relatively small number of jointly authored articles involving Russian coauthors in peer-reviewed journals and related publications.)\n\nBenefits for Russia\n\nMany of the world's leading biomedical laboratories are in the United States. They offer a variety of opportunities for visiting Russian scientists to improve their insights as to recent research achievements in the life sciences. Russian scientific visitors may have opportunities to assess methodological approaches that are appropriate for their laboratories in Russia as well. Also, U.S. laboratories are usually well connected internationally with contacts of possible interest to Russian colleagues.\n\nMany U.S. universities have become magnets for attracting outstanding research-oriented students from throughout the world, including Russia. Contacts that develop among important counterparts from many countries visiting U.S. universities during the early stages of their careers are often beneficial for visiting Russian specialists in both the short and long terms.\n\nOverall, U.S. laboratories are better equipped with modern instrumentation than Russian laboratories. Exposure of Russian specialists to advanced instrumentation may at times help their laboratories make wise investment decisions in choosing equipment that is most cost-effective for their needs. Also, bilateral cooperation can provide training opportunities for Russian specialists to become familiar with equipment operations, thereby reducing costs in Russia in bringing new equipment online. Russian exposure to equipment in other countries will also be useful, but there will be lingering questions among some Russian specialists as to whether they have seen the best, which is often equated with the state of the art in the United States.\n\nThe United States is a world leader in agriculture research, including approaches to reduce animal and plant diseases and increase agricultural productivity—topics that are of particular interest in Russia. Countries other than the United States also have strong agricultural research activities. However, the breadth of experience available in the United States often provides more complete coverage of areas of priority concern to Russia than experience of other countries. Recent bioengagement in this area has been beneficial for both countries, as discussed in Chapter 4. This cooperation provides a basis for future efforts.\n\nThe United States has more experience than Russia in the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops into large-scale production. If the Russian government increases its interest in encouraging developments in this field, the approaches of the United States to evaluate food safety and to limit environmental effects can be helpful to both Russian scientists and regulators. Important Russian scientists are particularly hopeful that the positive U.S. experiences will counter some of the misleading European commentary about GM organisms. Many protocols for carrying out both research activities and for introducing new GM crops into production have been well developed and adopted in the United States, and they can provide models for Russian approaches.10\n\nThe U.S. government and indeed many of the nation's scientists active in biological research and biotechnology have embraced the concept of responsible research in the life sciences. Exchanges can help Russian scientists join the international dialogues on this topic. Also, bioengagement can quickly lead to new insights about recent international developments concerning the handling of pathogens that should help avoid missteps in Russia.\n\nFinally, for many Russian scientists, one of the most important aspects of engagement is the opportunity to upgrade skills in research management. The transition from Soviet-style management to western-style management has not been easy. Twenty-two years after the splintering of the Soviet Union, Russian researchers and their mentors in the universities and at research institutes are still in the early stages of mastering new management skills. These personal capabilities need to be compatible with decentralized planning and free market economies while taking into account traditions and practices in Russia. In short, research planning, execution, and evaluation often improve during joint activities.\n\nBenefits for Both Countries\n\nInvestigations of outbreaks of contagious diseases are a priority activity in both countries. The likelihood of major scientific advances in addressing widespread concerns will be increased through coordination of parallel efforts of the two countries, as an important component of the broader international effort. A bilateral commitment to sustain these parallel efforts and share their results over the long term can improve the prospects for important advances.\n\nOf particular importance are activities of outstanding young scientists and entrepreneurs in the two countries and opportunities for international outreach. Both governments recognize that the technological futures of their countries are increasingly in the hands of new generations of scientists and are giving them special incentives to become leaders of initiatives of the government, such as priority for involvement in the laboratories at Skolkovo. At the same time, the U.S. scientific community continues to rely on the unbounded energy and ideas of fresh graduates of leading U.S. universities to find new trails through the challenges of biotechnology at home and abroad. Of course, continued involvement in joint activities of experienced managers, scientists, and other specialists, who are recognized leaders in their fields, is important. But the preparation of their successors for international leadership roles is of comparable importance.\n\nTurning to biosecurity in the broadest sense, there are opportunities to strengthen and build on bilateral foundations that have been put in place during the past two decades. Now there is widespread concern that past achievements may atrophy with the changing status of the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) and the declining budgets in the United States for support of Russian-oriented programs. New bilateral mechanisms to carry on the work initiated through the ISTC can increase the likelihood that momentum in gaining common understanding on biosecurity issues throughout the states of the former Soviet Union will not decline significantly. The roles of the United States and Russia will be at the center of the debates over successor mechanisms for cooperation to the ISTC. While these discussions will continue to be multilateral efforts, common U.S.-Russian views will be important in determining the outcomes of preliminary consultations that are under way.\n\nThe United States and Russia have the deepest histories in the world in dealing with extremely potent pathogens, and their experiences provide a strong basis for partnerships. The degree to which they cooperate directly will have a profound influence on the international community's attitudes and actions concerning the handling of pathogens and associated technologies that, if misused, can lead to catastrophes.\n\nBilateral cooperation between two countries that have been at the center of heated international debates over biosecurity obligations of state parties to the BTWC is important in overcoming the weaknesses of the BTWC. As the international community searches for acceptable procedures for compliance with the BTWC and related UN resolutions, U.S.-Russian collaborative efforts can continue to play a catalytic role in crystallizing common interests.\n\nThrough bilateral cooperation, the two countries can effectively contribute to the broad international agenda for addressing biosafety issues. These issues include, for example, (a) routine handling of dangerous pathogens; (b) responses to unanticipated health and safety problems that can arise when handling pathogens; (c) the need, criteria, and guidelines for establishing and operating high-containment facilities; and (d) coping with accidents involving a wide range of dangerous pathogens.\n\nWith or without bilateral cooperation, the two countries are viewed as pathfinders in many aspects of biosafety. The stakes are large, as the safety of people is on the line. Thus, it is better for the two countries to be working together and exchanging experiences in this regard than working along uncoordinated separate paths. Bioengagement can help ensure that this is the case.\n\nThe two countries have different sets of international contacts that open doors between counterparts and collectively provide excellent global coverage of almost all important research that could lead to significant discoveries in the biological sciences. Many developing countries have very few scientists who can address rapidly the emergence of new biology-oriented issues. For them to be able to simultaneously draw on U.S. and Russian mentors can avoid waste of time and money and reduce international misunderstandings and confusion.\n\nIn summary, historical reasons account for the different paths of the two countries in exploring many aspects of the phenomena encountered in the life sciences. They have established different priorities and developed different capabilities; but their common interests are magnified as both countries uncover new phenomena and attempt to assess the long-term impacts on health, agriculture, and the environment. Cooperation in understanding scientific discoveries, giving due consideration to both historical insights and biases, can increasingly benefit scientists and policy officials in the two countries.\n\nWhether Russia's new innovation complex at Skolkovo, for example, meets its biomedical goals or falls short, the energy and resources of leading U.S. and Russian officials and investors devoted to this high-profile undertaking will probably be substantial. It is better for respected U.S. and Russian scientists to be jointly involved in assessing the potential benefits of devoting efforts to this route of cooperation, which seems to have assured financial support from the Russian government, than simply to speculate about the biomedical activities that are carried out or should be carried out by others. While the short-term payoff from such cooperation may be difficult to measure, collaborating scientists will be able to provide insightful perspectives that might not be otherwise raised in discussions of this important development. In doing so, important personal and organizational relationships will emerge."
