        "meta_description": "Russian State Corporation of Nanotechnologies (RUSNANO) was established by the Federal Law in 2007. Its main activity is selection and co-investing money of the Federal budget in nanotechnology projects that have high potential for commercial or social benefit. RUSNANO investments in selected projects are expected to reach 1,5 bln. US dollars in 2009. RUSNANO uses Foresight and roadmapping techniques to support investment process involving in the activities leading Russian scientific and business institutes. Foresight allow revealing most perspective nano-enabled product groups for implementation in Russia in the long-term perspective and estimating required resources for setting up mass production. Roadmaps allow defining priorities for investments, R&D, staff training, infrastructure advance. They help RUSNANO to define strategic goals and choose the most promising technologies. 10 roadmaps are being developed at RUSNANO: Light emitting diodes, Nuclear energy, Aircraft industry, Spacecraft industry, Medicine and Pharmacy, Water cleaning and purification, Energy saving, Halocarbon composite fibres, Catalysts for petrochemical industry, Effective cutting instruments. More than 400 experts are actively participating in developing the roadmaps. The roadmaps will be ready in first half 2010. The presentation highlights RUSNANO strategic planning approach by an example of one of the developed roadmaps.",
