Notably decorated with two Imperial orders, this service was commissioned for Duke Georg Alexander of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1859-1909), who was the eldest of the two surviving sons of Duke Georg August of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and of Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna of Russia. Although he was a German Prince, Duke Georg Alexander lived in Russia throughout his life. He was a great-grandson of Emperor Paul I and a cousin of Emperor Alexander III. Duke Georg Alexander pursued a career as an officer in the Russian army and was Major General, Commander of the Life Guard Dragoon Regiment.
