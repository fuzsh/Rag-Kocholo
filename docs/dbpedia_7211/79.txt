[edit] Biography

Georg Alexander was born in Nice, France the eldest son of the then Count Georg of Carlow and his first wife Irina Raievskya (1892-1955). His father assumed the title Duke of Mecklenburg with the style Serene Highness following his adoption by the head of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and his uncle Duke Charles Michael. The adoption of the title was confirmed by the head of the Imperial House of Russia, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich on 18 July 1929 and recognised on 23 December by Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.[2]

With the death of Duke Charles Michael on 6 December 1934 his father succeeded as head of the Grand Ducal house of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and thus Georg Alexander became heir apparent. The grand ducal family lived at Remplin Castle in Mecklenburg until it was destroyed in a fire in April 1940. During the Second World War both Georg Alexander and his father were interned by the Gestapo for a time.

Duke Georg Alexander studied law in Freiburg before completing his studies in banking. On 18 December 1950 his fathers title was confirmed by the House of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and he then assumed the style of Highness.[2] Georg Alexander lived for a time in Ireland where he managed a number of properties. On returning to Germany he spent twenty years working for an advertising company.[3]

On 6 July 1962 he succeeded his father as head of the Grand Ducal house of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.[1] In 1990 he moved to Mecklenburg and was given an apartment in the former grand ducal residence of Mirow Castle by the local government and he was involved in its reconstruction.[4] Georg Alexander died in Mirow and was succeeded as head of the Grand Ducal house by his son Duke Georg Borwin.
