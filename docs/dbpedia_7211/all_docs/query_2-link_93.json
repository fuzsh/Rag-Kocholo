        "text": "Life\n\nHe was born in Neustrelitz as second son of George, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1779-1860) and his wife Marie (1796-1880), daughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen. His paternal grandparents were Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nHis sister Caroline Mariane married Frederick VII of Denmark. On 1860 his elder brother Frederick William succeeded their father as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nGeorge August died on 20 June 1876 in St. Petersburg, at the age of 52. The line of his son George soon died out; since his first son had married morganatically, his second son Charles Michael became titular grand duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz."
