        "text": "Eugen grew up in Karlsruhe in Silesia and was confirmed there in 1862. He went to study at the University of Tübingen and joined the Württemberg military service. In 1866 he became a lieutenant in the 3rd equestrian regiment and took part in the battle at Gochsheim in the war against Prussia. From September 1866 to July 1870 he took leave to continue his studies and was temporarily in Paris. From July 1868 to January 1869 he undertook a trip to the United States with his uncle William, Duke of Württemberg. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, he was a first lieutenant in the battles at Mezières, Chevilly, Mont Mesly and Villiers. In 1871 he became a captain, in 1872 he was transferred to the 1st Uhlan Regiment (King Karl) No. 19, in 1874 he became a major and in 1876 a staff officer.\n\nIn December 1876 Wilhelm Eugen was assigned to the 2nd Westphalian Hussar Regiment No. 11 in Düsseldorf as squadron chief. There he died of an \"abrupt and rapid disease\" at the age of 30 years and 5 months. At the funeral service, the clergyman described him as \"a truly lovable prince who, with his easy-going affection, with his equally friendly and agile word, won hearts everywhere, served many charitable works, and glorified many festive days\". At the time of his death, he was the next in line to the throne after Prince William, who later became king."
