It’s taken me a really long time to get to it, but I pulled it up now because – well, who doesn’t want to read a book about Josephine? She’s the ultimate royal survivor. But also, her son Eugène de Beauharnais had a son named Max who married one of my Romanov research subjects (Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, sister of Olga and Adini). I didn’t expect to find much about Eugène, and I didn’t – there’s more about Hortense than Eugène in this book. But I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more than I expected and I highly recommend it.\n\nFull disclosure: I’ve been quasi-obsessed with Josephine ever since 1987, when I saw Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story (a miniseries that ran on ABC when I was in sixth grade). In my mind, Napoleon will always be Armand Assante and Jacqueline Bisset will always be Josephine. Part of the pleasure of reading books about Napoleon and Josephine is imagining the characters as they appeared to me on the screen in sixth grace. So yeah, there’s some nostalgia happening here. But nostalgia or not, this book is extremely entertaining and stands on its own, without my rose-colored glasses.\n\nI’m not going summarize Josephine’s life here, other than to say she survived a shitty first marriage, the French revolution, and Napoleon’s rise to power. This book makes it clear just how much she had to sacrifice to stay on top of the world at Napoleon’s side – it sounds exhausting, honestly. This dude had needs. And one of those needs was for her to play a role – the majestic empress, the beautiful empress, the gracious empress, the witty empress, the sociable empress, the always available empress, the perfect empress. Even if you love someone, that is a lot to ask. But Josephine had no choice. Her ability to be the perfect empress was all she had to give him, considering she could not give him an heir. She made being the perfect wife and empress – minus said heir – her life’s work. And when Napoleon fell, in 1814, she died a few weeks later. Her heart and will to live had both been broken, it seems.\n\nI liked this book because it had good pacing and good writing. Williams wants to entertain you and educate you, and her formula works. There’s also a lot of detail here about the Bonapartes and artwork – confiscated versus purchased – which I enjoyed.\n\nInterestingly, I’d always read that Josephine died of diphtheria, but this book says it was probably pneumonia and doesn’t mention diphtheria at all. Is that a more modern take on it? Has the diphtheria diagnosis been relegated to the dustbin of history? It doesn’t matter at all. It’s just one of those things I happen to remember from all the books I read when I was a kid.\n\nCaveats\n\nNo serious caveats – just a missed opportunity and a few questionable word choices.\n\nEarly in the book, Williams makes it a point to note – a handful of times – that Josephine’s Black maid, Euphémie Lefèvre, was also likely her half sister. But after Josephine became Paul Barras’s mistress, we don’t hear anything about Euphémie. Once Josephine is already empress, we get this single line: “Josephine had long since sent away Euphémie Lefèvre, her maid and probable half sister, but supported her with a pension, and Euphémie eventually was able to buy a rather large property near Malmaison.” (Ch 16, loc 4187) So…do we know exactly when they parted? Did Euphémie want to retire, or did Josephine no longer want to employ her? After taking such care to emphasize the likely blood connection, Williams dropped the ball on telling us more. Even a line stating that we don’t know when or why they parted company would have been nice.\n\nOn Plombieres and its attractions: “…hundreds of well-heeled invalids had flocked to Plombieres: rheumatic old women and gout-ridden men, along with dozens of frantic infertile women.” The “frantic” description bothered me – why not just infertile? Why make them sound so desperate? Even if they were, this word has a bad connotation that, in this context, feels judgey to me.\n\nAt one point, when talking about Josephine and her affair with Hippolyte Charles, Williams describes her as “the only woman who dared betray Napoleon.” (Ch 11, 2813) Well, not really. If you mean “betray” in terms of marriage, Marie Louise hooked up with Adam Neipperg while she was still married to Napoleon. And if you mean “betray” in general terms, his sister Caroline betrayed him to try and stay on the throne of Naples. And those are just two examples off the top of my head. A little sensationalistic, then, to describe Josephine that way.\n\nAt points, Williams seems on the verge of judging her subject. Take this sentence, for example: “Seductive, a survivor of prison, stylish, and somewhat lacking in morals, Marie-Joseph fit in to this circle perfectly.” (Ch 5, loc 1174) Okay, but were Josephine's \"morals\" any better or worse than the crowd she ran with? The people who ran the country at the time? The whole point of the Directory seemed to be that it had no morals - everyone was just glad to be alive after the Terror. So what sort of judgment is this? And is it really appropriate? Then, later, we get this sentence, which seems to excuse the lack of whatever 'morals' were implied in the previous statement: “To her, romance and sex were a path to status and security, the bargains that a woman had to make to survive.” (Ch 5, loc 1483) Is Williams excusing Josephine? Or chastising her? She walks a fine line here, but it seems unnecessary to judge your subject at all. We weren't there. We can't judge.\n\nTidbits\n\nSince I read this in eBook and this particular edition doesn’t have equivalent page numbers for the paperback, the citations you see are the chapter number and the Kindle location.\n\nDuring the Terror (and prior to her arrest), Josephine moved out of Paris to Croissy, a suburb, and rented a house that used to belong to Madame Campan, Marie Antoinette’s lady-in-waiting. From her window, she noticed a beautiful chateau – Malmaison, which she would later own and make world-famous. (Ch 4, loc 945)\n\nJacques-Louis David, the painter who later immortalized the moment when Napoleon crowned her empress, signed her first husband’s arrest warrant and death warrant during the revolution. (Ch 4, loc 962; Ch 16, loc 4135)\n\nHere’s how Josephine described herself: “Taking a side has always seemed tiring to my Creole nonchalance, I find it easier to follow the will of others.” (Ch 6, loc 1517)\n\nNapoleon sent some really weird requests to the Directory as he attempted to set up a French base of actions in Cairo. This is the order of things he wanted sent to him: “1st , a company of actors ; 2d , a company of dancers ; 3d , some dealers in marionettes , at least three or four ; 4th , a hundred French women ; 5th , the wives of all the men employed in the corps ; 6th , twenty surgeons , thirty apothecaries , and ten Physicians ; 7th , some founders ; 8th , some distillers and dealers in liquor ; 9th , fifty gardeners with their families , and the seeds of every kind of vegetable ; 10th , each party to bring with them : 200,000 pints of brandy ; 11th , 30,000 ells of blue and scarlet cloth ; 12th , a supply of soap and oil…” (Ch 7, loc 2199) I mean, marionette dealers before surgeons and doctors? Seriously, dude?\n\nWhen Napoleon’s flagship, L’Orient, sank at the hands of Nelson’s guns, it went to the bottom of the sea with 600,000 livres worth of gold and diamonds Napoleon had stolen from Malta. (Ch 9, loc 2227)\n\nNapoleon had FEELINGS about what women should look like and what they should wear. We’re told he had “an invincible hatred of a fat woman.” And that he hated dark dresses. He wanted his wife and stepdaughter to wear only French products, which did not include Josephine’s beloved cashmere shawls and Indian muslin. Josephine and Hortense tried to lie and say their muslin was “St. Quentin linen,” but if Napoleon didn’t believe them, he would rip the offending dresses to shreds with his hands. (Ch 11, loc 2761-4)\n\nI did not realize her Malmaison zoo was so extensive. She had kangaroos, emus, llamas, a zebra, a gnu, flying squirrels, gazelles, Chinese pheasants, and Australian black swans. She also collected taxidermy animals and birds – and since I love taxidermy, too, we would have had something in common. (Ch 12, loc 2941-57)\n\nHortense perhaps foresaw the future of being a 21st century creative. “On one occasion at Malmaison, Hortense failed to make an appearance at dinner. When Josephine went to her daughter’s room and found her drawing, she asked whether she was hoping to earn a living from her hobby. Astute for her age, Hortense replied: ‘Mama, in the century in which we are living, who is to say that that might not happen?’” (Ch 12, loc 3054)\n\nTheir happy moments made me smile. In the Tuileries, as emperor and empress, their lives weren’t totally devoid of affectionate moments: “His valet, Constant, would go to her apartments between seven and eight A.M. and sometimes find the pair still asleep. ‘When the Emperor asked me for tea or for an infusion of orange flowers and started to get up, the Empress would say to him smilingly, ‘Must you get up already? Stay a little longer.’ His Majesty would answer, ‘You mean you are not asleep?’ and he would roll her up in her blanket, giving her little taps on her cheek and on her shoulders, laughing and kissing her.’” (Ch 16, loc 4149)\n\nAt the time, French fine dining did not consist of courses. “The custom of serving all the dishes together still prevailed , rather than the à la russe fashion of eating courses in sequence.” (Ch 16, loc 4226)\n\nWhen Napoleon proposed marrying his stepson, Eugène, to Princess Augusta of Bavaria, her father – the Elector of Bavaria – suggested Napoleon divorce Josephine and marry Augusta himself. (Ch 17, loc 4486)\n\nCrown Prince Frederick Louis of Mecklenburg-Strelitz had the hots for Josephine (while she was still married to Napoleon). When she went to the theater with him, Napoleon “was infuriated, declaring his wife a second Marie Antoinette and demanding that his rival leave Paris within two days.” (Ch 19, loc 4902) After the divorce, he asked Josephine about marriage, but she wouldn’t consider it.\n\nNot long before their divorce, when they both knew their time was almost up, they still behaved like honeymooners. “He then spent the last days in Bayonne relaxing with Josephine, pleased with a job well done. They ran hand in hand along the beach and swam in the sea. He played his usual tricks, throwing her shoes into the water and pushing her over in the sand. They were like young lovers on honeymoon.” (Ch 19, loc 4945)\n\nNapoleon’s second wife, Marie Louise, did not care for some of his outrageous rules: “Nearly two o’clock and the Emperor would not allow me to eat in the carriage! He said a woman should never have to eat. I was so angry and hungry that it gave me a fearful headache and so much bad humor that the Emperor was furious. I didn’t care. If I return in another world, I would certainly not remarry.” (Ch 20, loc 5329)\n\nWhen Josephine died in 1814, Napoleon wrote: “No woman was ever loved with more devotion, ardour and tenderness, only death could break a union formed by sympathy, love and true feeling.” (Ch 21, loc 5697)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nAbsolutely. Whether you’re already a Josephine fan or not, this book will give you a great feel for who she was and why she mattered, both to Bonaparte and to the world at large.\n\nWilliams does a good job of treating her as a human being – she’s not a paragon here, but neither is she slut-shamed, as she was by many of her contemporaries (including Napoleon’s own family). In my caveat section above, I only mentioned the author's seeming judgment of Josephine because it felt so out of place in the context of the rest of the book (where Williams is neutral about Josephine's cheating and war profiteering, but very sympathetic to the demands she faced as a beleaguered empress).\n\nA constant theme remains Josephine's love for her children (and theirs for her). Even though this book doesn’t shed much light on Josephine as a mother, we’re constantly told that she wanted her children with her, no matter what was going on in her life. And the bond both her grown children shared with her must have meant she did something right. She was a woman of charm, of grace, of taste - and this book shows how far she came from being a girl judged to have none of these things. Highly recommended.\n\nBecoming a Romanov\n\nSubtitle: Grand Duchess Elena of Russia and her World (1807-1873)\n\nAuthors: Marina Soroka and Charles A. Ruud\n\nPublisher: Routledge\n\nYear: 2016\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nThis is the only full-length English-language source on Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, so it was a no-brainer that I’d have to buy it. I was looking for information on Elena and her three daughters, one of whom married Adolph of Nassau (father of my research subject Hilda of Baden). This book is a goldmine of information for anyone interested in the reign of Nicholas I or the emancipation of the serfs early in the reign of his son, Alexander II.\n\nElena was born Princess Charlotte of Württemberg, a daughter of Prince Paul and granddaughter of King Friedrich I. The Württemberg royals are dysfunctional as all get out, so let’s just say she had a shitty childhood. She was proud and she was smart, two things that the world didn’t really want or need in a princess. But thanks to her Württemberg blood, she was selected as a bride for Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich by his mother, the Württemberg -born Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Upon conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, she was rechristened Elena Pavlovna.\n\nUnfortunately, her marriage to Mikhail was a disaster. They were just temperamentally different, and although there’s a lot to like about each of them separately, it was a trainwreck when they were together. Still, they had three surviving daughters: Maria, Elizaveta (Lilli), and Ekaterina (Catya). They functioned best when Elena and Mikhail lived separate lives, so that’s what happened for the next couple decades.\n\nAfter Mikhail’s death in 1849, Elena was free to pursue more of the interests she’d kept under wraps: science, education, religion, and politics. She became a famous society hostess, with a knack for putting the right people together to get shit done. Behind the scenes, she was influential in pushing the agenda to liberate the serfs in her nephew Alexander II’s reign. Although she couldn’t be seen to be involved, she made sure the right people were in the right place at the right time. And if they weren’t, she used her social skills and soft power to steer things back on course. She supported the liberal agenda, insisting that the serfs must be freed and given land to have the best chance of success.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about Elena, but she’s definitely a flawed character (as we’d say about a TV show heroine). This book gives you the good and the bad about her – her haughtiness, her pride, and her selfishness along with her energy, her enthusiasm for reform, and her desire to do good things for Russia.\n\nKeep in mind this isn’t a popular history; this is more of an academic biography. As a casual reader, the first half of the book was much more entertaining than the second. That’s where we get the scandalous details of Elena’s childhood and marriage to Mikhail, all of which feel as much like a soap opera as real history. The second half of the book is about her involvement in nursing programs, the abolition movement, religious issues of the day, and the establishment of a musical conservatory in Russia. Worthy causes and definitely worth knowing about…but these later chapters, although they contain the bulk of her cultural and political achievements, make for dry reading.\n\nAn incredible amount of research went into this book, and my hat’s off to the authors for bringing this little-known woman into the English-speaking public sphere.\n\nTidbits\n\nYoung Charlotte didn’t think highly of her grandmother or her governess. She supposedly told a friend her grandmother, born Princess Charlotte of Great Britain, was an alcoholic, and later described her as “of limited intelligence” and “despotic.” Remembering her governess later caused her to write: “submission to stupidity ever since has seemed unbearable to me.” (7-8)\n\nGrand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich was in love with someone else. Before his marriage, he fell for one of his mother’s maids-of-honor, Princess Praskovia Hilkova. He felt he had nothing to offer Praskovia and didn’t pursue her. Instead, he let his mom badger him into marrying Charlotte.\n\nDuring a stay in England, there were rumors Elena flirted too much with the king’s illegitimate son. Elena met King William IV, and apparently, caused a firestorm of gossip by spending time alone with William’s illegitimate son, the Earl of Munster.\n\nElena founded a community of nurses that became the basis for the Russian Red Cross. At the start of the Crimean War in 1853, she founded the Holy Cross community of nurses. She organized and recruited women who were trained as nurses and deployed to the war zone under the supervision of a male doctor – but not the War Department, which meant Elena’s nurses could move fast and break things, in startup parlance. The community was a success, eventually including a roll of 236 names. Of these, 30 died from disease or wounds during the Crimean War. They worked in camps and hospitals in Perekop, Belbek, Bakhchisarai, Kherson, Simferopol, Odessa, Nikolaev, and Finland. (205, 211)\n\nShe co-founded a Russian school for music with pianist Anton Rubinstein. After meeting him in 1852, she hired him as her court musician – but Rubinstein chafed at the requirements of being at society’s beck and call. Elena and Rubinstein had a productive but fractious relationship (at least, that’s how his memoirs seem to describe their working relationship). The tidbits quoted in this book make it seem like he disliked her intensely. He quit in 1864 when they had a difference of opinion over regulations for their music school.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you’re interested in 19th century Russia, yes.\n\nIf you’re interested in Romanov women, yes.\n\nIf those two things don’t float your boat, you might find this a little dry. It’s a specialty topic, for sure.\n\nback to top\n\nCaught in the Revolution\n\nSubtitle: Witnesses to the Fall of Imperial Russia\n\nAuthor: Helen Rappaport\n\nPublisher: St. Martin’s Press\n\nYear: 2016\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this book because I’m a sucker for anything on the Russian Revolution. Plus, the more into research I get, the more I see the value of primary sources like the ones this author uncovered. As an impatient high school and college student, I often skipped or skimmed primary sources – I wanted gossip and analysis, not “thee”s and “thou”s of old letters. But now that I’m older and theoretically wiser, I do want those primary accounts of historical events. This book definitely scratched that itch.\n\nThis book is the story of Russia’s two revolutions in 1917, as seen and documented by foreign visitors and residents of St. Petersburg (renamed Petrograd during World War I). Some of these accounts come from published sources, but others are new because the author tracked them down in archives. The author tells you what you need to know to understand the eyewitnesses’ writing…without drowning you in detail, which I really appreciated. She has woven their writing into the bigger picture, so to speak, so you get as much of her storytelling as you do their primary source material.\n\nSome of the eyewitnesses include:\n\nLillie Bouton de Fernandez Azabal, Countess Nostitz – I read her memoir and reviewed it here, in the 2021 Royal Reading List\n\nJohn Reed and his wife, Louise Bryant – American journalists and socialists\n\nThe Buchanan family – British ambassador George, his wife Georgina, and their daughter Meriel\n\nJulia Dent Grant, Princess Cantacuzène-Speransky – Ulysses S. Grant’s granddaughter, married to a Russian prince\n\nRheta Childe Door – American journalist\n\nArno Dosch-Fleurot – American journalist\n\nDavid Francis – US Ambassador to Russia 1916-1918\n\nFlorence Harper – Canadian reporter\n\nPhilip Jordan – David Francis’s Black valet\n\nSomerset Maugham – English novelist & spy\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst – English suffragette\n\nLeighton Rogers – American employee of National City Bank’s Petrograd branch\n\nTidbits\n\nAt the time of the revolution, French was the primary language used among both the aristocracy and government employees. The Journal de St-Pétersbourg was “the semi-official organ of the Russian Foreign Office…” (3)\n\nFrench war correspondent Ludovic Naudeau’s description of how Russia affected writers: “You fall under a spell. You realize you are in another world, and you feel you must not only understand it: you must get it down on paper … you will not know enough about Russia to explain anything until you have been here so long you are half-Russian yourself, and then you won’t be able to tell anybody anything at all about it … You will find yourself tempted to compare Russia with other countries. Don’t.” (28)\n\nImmediately prior to the February revolution, people were so cold – and supplies of firewood so limited – that people snuck into cemeteries at night to steal wooden crosses from graves to use as firewood. (63)\n\nAlso just prior to the February revolution, the French ambassador – Maurice Paléologue – had been reading the letters of an exiled 19th century philosopher, Petr Chaadaev, who wrote, “The Russians are one of those nations which seem to exist only to give humanity terrible lessons.” (47)\n\nDuring the February revolution, rioters burned the District Court. But more than criminal records got burned – we also lost archives that dated back to Catherine the Great. (87)\n\nThe British ambassador – Sir George Buchanan – was so well-known and respected that, as he passed down the street, fighting factions of the Pavlovosk regiment put down their guns and waited until he’d passed to keep shooting at each other. (107)\n\nThe nine-man American delegation, called the Root Mission, came to Petrograd after the February Revolution with $600,000 to spend. They were housed in the Winter Palace, and given access to the wine cellar. One diplomat heard that the Russians dug around in the cellar and managed to find “some rye whisky ‘that had been laid in for the visit of General Grand in 1878’.” (190)\n\nPrince Felix Yusupov gave visiting suffragette Emeline Pankhurst and her colleague, Jessie Kenney, a tour of his mansion and showed them where Rasputin had been murdered. (201)\n\nSome of the members of the American Red Cross Mission who arrived in July 1917 got to see the inside of the Winter Palace. Many of the imperial family’s things were still there. Orrin Sage Wightman saw Alexei’s French workbook, where he’d written in French, “The French lesson is very hard today.” (233)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. Even if you don’t have much interest in the revolution, it was fascinating to see how the Americans, British, and French reacted to events in St. Petersburg. It brought a whole new perspective to hear these events described by outsiders. The book feels like a novel at times – there’s a plot, characters, and suspense as to what’s going to happen next. It’s well-written and fast-paced; overall, I enjoyed this quite a bit and think you will, too.\n\nback to top\n\nChristian IX\n\nAuthor: Hans Roger Madol (translated from German/Danish)\n\nPublisher: Collins\n\nYear: 1939\n\nAvailable at: Abe Books\n\nI picked up a used copy of this biography of King Christian IX of Denmark because I heard it had information about Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel, husband of Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia. It did, but it was also a good chance to learn about the “Father-in-law of Europe” – whose daughters married into the royal families of Great Britain, Russia, and Hanover and whose sons became kings of Denmark and Greece.\n\nThis is the story of King Christian IX of Denmark – who started out as Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck. Say that five times fast, will you? But thanks to the oddities and infirmities of the Danish royal family tree, he was one of several candidates to ascend the Danish throne when it looked like King Frederick VII was going to die without a male heir.\n\nThe problem?\n\nHe wasn’t the only candidate – and the king wasn’t his biggest fan, either. What saved his candidacy was the fact that, during a war between Denmark and the German states, he was the only one of his family to side with Denmark.\n\nLiterally the only one.\n\nChristian was devoted to Denmark, through and through, and even though King Frederick VII had some moments of petty jealousy and doubts about his loyalty that threatened his candidacy, he won out with persistence and consistency. And good thing, too. As this book makes clear, Christian was an old-school kind of guy who believed in personal honor and doing the right thing. He was also a capable constitutional monarch, capable of subverting his personal feelings to do what his government asked him to do. He was the right man for the job, even if it took his subjects a few decades to catch on and appreciate him.\n\nOver and over, what you hear about this guy is that he conducted his life – and raised his family – with a deep sense of honor, simplicity, integrity, and truthfulness. That’s why you hear those descriptions applied to his kids: Princess Alexandra (later Queen Alexandra of Great Britain & Ireland), Princess Dagmar (later Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia), Princess Thyra (later Duchess of Cumberland), Prince Friedrich (later King of Denmark), Prince William (later King George of Greece), and Prince Valdemar (happy not to be a king, despite several thrones offered to him, thank you very much).\n\nHis legacy is in his integrity and the sense of duty and decency he instilled in his many, many descendants.\n\nCaveats\n\nMy only caveat is the difficulty inherent in grasping the family’s origins, branches, and nomenclature changes. I’m not a stupid person (three college degrees!), but the first chapter of this book made me as confused as some of the readings in my postmodern fiction class.\n\nI just couldn’t grasp the relationships without constant reference to the family trees at the end of the book (but even these were selective, and some people mentioned in the text were left out of the trees, which wasn’t helpful). And the frequent nomenclature changes aren’t always explained. The same person – Christian IX’s father – appears with all the following surnames in the first 23 pages: “Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck,” “Beck Glücksburg,” and “Holstein-Beck (afterwards Glücksburg).”\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nI’m all for being accurate when referring to people – but in this case, it’s beyond my grasp based on the material provided here. Luckily, this frustration eases the further you get into the book, but I still have no clear idea how or why these surnames are or are not correct at various points.\n\nTidbits\n\nBefore Christian became the leading candidate for the Danish throne, it looked like the Russian Oldenburgs were going to get it. They had the support of the European powers (mostly because at this time, the European powers did whatever Tsar Nicholas I wanted them to do), but they didn’t shown any enthusiasm and lost the opportunity. I’ll have to look up and see which Grand Duke of Oldenburg Madol means in this context, since he never provides a Christian name, just the family name. Grand Duchess Catherine (sister of Tsar Alexander I) had married a Grand Duke of Oldenburg. And I think their oldest son married Princess Theresa of Nassau. I’m not sure whether it’s Catherine’s widow or Therese’s husband who would have taken the Danish throne had he appeared to give a shit. Not crucial to the story, but again, Madol could have provided that clarification with next to no effort and didn’t.\n\nChristian had a long-standing relationship with the Russian royal family after several trips there in the 1840s. In July 1857 when Tsar Alexander II visited Kiel, a few Danish royals went to greet him. He hugged Christian, but shook hands with Crown Prince Ferdinand. “I suppose,” said Ferdinand, “I am too small for him to stoop down to embrace me.” (106)\n\nApparently, the people of Denmark were not happy when Christian and Louise named their second daughter Dagmar, after a historic queen. “How they had once reviled him for calling his daughter after Queen Dagmar! And yet how often and how happily had Princess Dagmar proved, both as Russian Grand-duchess and as Tsarina, that she felt at heart a Dane!” (264) Reminds me of how people in Italy went ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ when Victor Emmanuel announced “Mafalda” as his daughter’s name.\n\nPrince Valdemar – Christian IX’s youngest son – was offered and refused the throne of Bulgaria after Sandro Battenberg was forced out. He preferred his career in the navy and his wife, Princess Marie d’Orléans, was like, hell to the no. The throne eventually went to Prince Ferdinand of Coburg (“Foxy Ferdinand”). (226)\n\nChristian’s oldest son and heir, Prince Frederick, married Princess Louisa of Sweden. But Christian’s wife, Queen Louise, and the bride’s mother were both against the match. The Swedish queen wanted a German son-in-law and Queen Louise would have preferred her son marry Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s daughter. But Queen Victoria would never have sent one of her daughters to Denmark because she was a little obsessed with the shitty treatment her great-aunt, Queen Caroline Matilda (sister of King George III), had received in Denmark.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nI think so. If you can pick up a cheap used copy, go for it. This book illuminates a portion of Danish and German history that I knew very little about. I can’t say I’ve absorbed it all or internalized it all yet, but I have a much better background than I did before. However, if just reading the caveat above made you break out in hives, this is not the book for you. The entire first half is largely about the interminable succession debates and the fight of Schleswig-Holstein. Caveat emptor.\n\nback to top\n\nThe Crimean War\n\nAuthor: Orlando Figes\n\nPublisher: Metropolitan Books\n\nYear: 2010\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this eBook because it’s tangentially related to one of my big research projects: the daughters and nieces of Tsar Nicholas I. Although the grand duchesses weren’t involved in the war, Russia’s shoddy performance helped send Nicholas into an early grave. I’m not a fan of war history, but in this case, knowing more could only help create a fuller picture of what Russia went through during their lives.\n\nBefore reading this book, the facts I knew about the Crimean War could have fit on one hand:\n\nFlorence Nightingale cleaned up British military hospitals\n\nthe Charge of the Light Brigade was something disastrous yet somehow admirable (and Tennyson's poem about it was later quoted by Tim Curry as Wadsworth in the movie Clue)\n\ntraditional enemies France and Britain ganged up on Russia\n\nthe most famous battle was the Siege of Sevastopol\n\nThat’s it.\n\nI had no idea what caused it, or what lasting effects it had. Turns out, there were lots.\n\nIn a nutshell, the war had multiple causes. Ostensibly, it was about Russia’s need to exert its influence over Turkey by claiming to have the right to protect the Orthodox Christians and holy sites within the Ottoman Empire. That was partly true, but it was also about Russia positioning itself advantageously for the inevitable fall of the Ottoman Empire. Notice that I didn’t say it was about Russia trying to hasten that fall or conquer Ottoman territory. (He’d already tried that in 1829, but Austria wouldn’t take the bait.)\n\nIn 1844, Nicholas I told Queen Victoria to her face that taking over Constantinople was not his goal. But Victoria’s Russophobic douchebag of a prime minister, Palmerston, didn’t believe Nicholas. So he whipped up the British press into a frenzy, turning public opinion against Nicholas and Russia until it seemed like any move Nicholas made portended his takeover of the Balkans, of Turkey, and (gasp!) even of the British empire in India. Absolutely no truth to it, of course, but British politicians like Canning and Palmerston simply could not accept the fact that Nicholas had no intention of taking Turkish territory.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nThat’s what caused the war.\n\nYes, you can pull in lots of other threads. Emperor Napoleon III needed a nice little war to cement his new status as emperor and quiet internal dissent – and sticking it to Orthodox Russia for how they’d treated the Catholic Poles in 1830 was a bonus. Then Austria refused to support Russia because they were afraid the Slavs in their far-flung empire would rise in support of Russia rather than back the Habsburg monarchy. But part of the reason Nicholas had been ballsy enough to declare war on Turkey was that he assumed – after saving Franz Josef’s throne in 1848 – that Franz Josef would have had the decency to do him a solid and return the favor. That didn’t happen.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nLong story short, no one sided with Russia. So when Nicholas declared war on Turkey, Britain and France declared war on Russia and Austria, Prussia, and Sweden sat the whole thing out.\n\nThe French did the heavy lifting for the allies, and the Russians realized their prized million-man army was no good because parade-ground drills weren’t the same thing as war (contrary to the belief of Tsar Nicholas and his brother, Grand Duke Mikhail). So those guys do bear responsibility for what happened after war was declared, but in my opinion, less responsibility for the war starting in the first place than Figes assigns them.\n\nBut you should read this book and make your own decision.\n\nLike most wars, dreams of glory and a quick finish vanished a few weeks in. I won’t go into the details here, but illness and disease did more damage than the actual battles. The Russians performed poorly (except when it came to defending Sebastopol, which they did amazingly well for 11 long months). But no one had the heart to continue the war for more than a couple years, and in the end, the Treaty of Paris slapped Russia on the wrist by taking away the Black Sea fleet (and its access to the Mediterranean).\n\nThat status quo didn’t last, however – about 20 years later, Russia got the right to have a Black Sea fleet back. So what, you ask, was the point of the tens of thousands of men who died? Ay, there’s the rub…\n\nCaveats\n\nNone.\n\nThis is very well written and thoroughly researched. Multiple times throughout the book, Figes says Nicholas I bears the primary responsibility for starting the war – but he didn’t convince me of this. I came away feeling like the British Prime Minister, Palmerston, bears equal (if not more) responsibility. But that’s my personal opinion and has no bearing on the book’s quality, which is excellent.\n\nTidbits\n\nFiges continually references Nicholas I succumbing to “the hereditary mental illness that troubled Alexander and Nicholas’s other brother, the Grand Duke Constantine….” This was the first I’d seen of a mention of mental illness relative to the change in Nicholas toward the end of his reign. The symptoms? Nicholas “grew increasingly irritable and impatient, inclined to rash behaviour and angry rages…” (57) I don’t know, man. That sounds like half the crowned heads of Europe throughout history. I’m not sure mental illness can be blamed for this. More like the stress of realizing his bureaucracy – intended to help run the empire – had become a multi-headed hydra of incompetence and corruption. That’s enough to make anyone a little pissy. In any case, the footnote cites three Russian-language sources, so maybe that particular interpretation hasn’t made it into accepted Western versions of his reign yet.\n\n19th century British hypocrisy in one sentence by Figes: “The British may have totally supplanted the Mughal Empire in India, but they were determined to stop the Russians doing the same to the Ottomans, presenting themselves as the honest defenders of the status quo in the Near East.” (62-3)\n\nEuropean hypocrisy and Russophobia in three sentences by Pogodin: “France takes Algeria from Turkey, and almost every year England annexes another Indian principality: none of this disturbs the balance of power; but when Russia occupies Moldavia and Wallachia, albeit only temporarily, that disturbs the balance of power. France occupies Rome and stays there several years in peacetime: that is nothing, but Russia only thinks of occupying Constantinople, and the peace of Europe is threatened. The English declare war on the Chinese, who have, it seems, offended them: no one has a right to intervene; but Russia is obliged to ask Europe for permission if it quarrels with its neighbour.” (184)\n\nQueen Victoria’s impression of Nicholas I: “’He gives Albert and myself the impression of a man who is not happy, and on whom the burden of his immense power and position weighs heavily and painfully,’ she wrote to Leopold on 4 June. ‘He seldom smiles, and when he does, the expression is not a happy one.’” That’s in part because, back in Tsarskoe Selo, his pregnant daughter Adini was dying of consumption – she was weeks away from death at this point. I’d love to know if he told Victoria this. It would have explained a lot of his sadness at that particular moment. (96)\n\nIt seems like the fastest way to die in 19th century Europe was to be a soldier in the Russian army. The stats Figes provides are ghastly. In Poland in 1830-1, 7,000 soldiers were killed while 85,000 died of illness or their injuries. In Hungary in 1849, 708 soldiers were killed by 57,000 had to be hospitalized for illness or injuries. And in peacetime, 65% of the Russian army was sick at any time. (164)\n\nThe role of journalism in British policy: “’An English Minister must please the newspapers,’ lamented Aberdeen, a Conservative of the old school…’The newspapers are always bawling for interference. They are bullies, and they make the Government a bully.’” (202)\n\nThe allied forces didn’t take any winter clothes with them when they invaded Crimea. They had almost no idea what the landscape or weather was like – they relied on old travel memoirs, and failed to remember what happened in 1812. Napoleon thought he’d be in and out, too. And just like with Napoleon, Britain and France had to rush winter supplies to their freezing soldiers once it became obvious the war wasn’t going to end that fall. SMH. (267)\n\nAfter the battle of Alma, when the French captured the fleeing Prince Menshikov’s carriage, they found: “a field kitchen, letters from the Tsar, 50,000 francs, pornographic French novels, the general’s boots, and some ladies’ underwear.” I feel like there's a story here. (295)\n\nSpecificity is key in giving orders. The famous Charge of the Light Brigade would have ended differently if their commander, Raglan, had given clearer orders. But instead of specifying that he wanted them to recapture the British guns on the Causeway Heights, he ordered them to capture the guns. Well, there were the aforementioned Causeway Heights guns and…three other sets of guns. What the hell was he talking about? So they went to capture the Russian guns at the end of a wide-open valley, figuring their commander *must* have meant the enemy’s guns, right? Nope. He meant their guns, abandoned to the Russians, which he had decided he wanted back. SMH again. (333)\n\nShould You Read This?\n\nProbably – but if you tend to doze off during battle scenes or descriptions of military strategy, you may struggle.\n\nOn the plus side, there are plenty of first-hand accounts to liven up the typical descriptions of battles…and plenty of personalities to admire (Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale, any of the French Zouaves) or fume in rage at (Palmerston, Raglan). Plus, if you’re interested in the antecedents of trench warfare (no, WWI was not the first), you’ll like this eye-opening look at how soldiers endured what would later be known as shell-shock.\n\nDaisy Princess of Pless\n\nSubtitle: A Discovery\n\nAuthor: W. John Koch\n\nPublisher: Books by W. John Koch Publishing\n\nYear: 2003\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nIf you’re looking for an upper-class perspective on Edwardian society and World War I, Daisy is a fantastic source for you. I bought this book because I’d read one of Daisy’s books, Daisy Princess of Pless by Herself (1929). You can download it for free from Archive.org, along with a couple others she wrote: Better Left Unsaid and From My Private Diary. Of course, getting the story from the source is ideal, but it’s also good to get a modern perspective on a historical figure. I wanted to see what Daisy might have glossed over or left out, hence this biography.\n\nIf you’ve heard of Daisy, it’s probably in the context of her role as a late Victorian/Edwardian social butterfly.\n\nShe was born Mary Theresa Cornwallis-West to a family of British gentry descended from the Earls De La Warr. In 1891, as a teenager, she married the fantastically rich Hans Heinrich, Prince of Pless and moved to Germany. Her life story is one of never-ending conflict: conflict with an older husband who didn’t share her interests, conflict between the strict etiquette of imperial Germany and her liberal tendencies, and conflict in being an English woman in Germany during World War I and its aftermath.\n\nDaisy fell victim to the distrust and hatred that sprang up between Germans and the British in the years during and leading up to World War I. Many of her German peers (and the German press) labeled her a British spy and overlooked the contributions she made through Red Cross nursing during the war. She tried like hell to prevent the war by acting as an unofficial go-between for the Kaiser and the British monarchs, King Edward VII and King George V. A personal friend of all these men, she had the ability and the guts to deliver truth with a sunny smile.\n\nSpoiler alert: it didn’t work.\n\nThat’s what makes Daisy’s story so heartbreaking – her life was never the same once war broke out. She went from being one of the most beautiful, glamorous women in the world to dealing with disability and poverty, stripped of her influence. There are some bridges you just can’t rebuild.\n\nWhat You Won’t Find\n\nBecause the author spoke to people who knew Daisy – as well as her oldest son Hansel – you shouldn’t expect this book to dive too deeply into any scandals. Think of this as an “authorized” biography. For example, there are vague hints that something bad happened to Daisy’s youngest son, Bolko. He’s barely mentioned at all; there was one offhand mention of a heart condition, and then a later mention of his sad, tragic life. We’re only told that he died under mysterious circumstances, with no details as to what those circumstances are. There isn’t even a mention of how old he was when he died.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe author has a strange reluctance to talk about Daisy as a mother. He failed to mention when she had her three children; the reader only knows they exist when they suddenly appear in quotations from her diary. On page 55, for example, we’re up to the year 1894 – and suddenly, in a quoted tidbit, we see that Daisy wrote, “…shall I really see my little baby again whose brown hair I have around my neck in a locket…”. As a reader, this was incredibly jolting. What baby? We had never been told she was pregnant. Where was the baby born? What was her reaction to becoming a mother? Did it bring her closer to her husband at all? The author is silent on this and any questions relating to the birth of any of her three children. We’re told she wasn’t thrilled with the idea of her third pregnancy, but that’s it.\n\nEven if Daisy wasn’t the most nurturing of mothers, motherhood is still an important part of any subject’s life. This author dropped the ball on including even the most basic facts about this facet of her life. And even if her children didn’t want those details in the book, fine – at least tell the reader when they were born to provide continuity.\n\nThere are also a couple mistakes that identify sons of Wilhelm II as his brothers (August Wilhelm and Eitel Fritz).\n\nTidbits\n\nHans Heinrich of Pless originally came to London to win the hand of Princess Mary (May) of Teck, the future Queen Mary of Great Britain and Ireland. Daisy, it seems, was a “second choice.” Ouch. (25)\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II had an annoying way of summoning people: “…the Emperor asked her rather quickly for a second dance by beckoning to her with his index finger and then pointing to the floor…This peculiar habit of calling someone to his side was one of the notorious, much disliked practices of the Emperor; it made the ladies blush in embarrassment, while men would gnash their teeth in anger and humiliation.” OMG, this would drive me crazy. (45)\n\nDaisy had a platonic affair with an unidentified nobleman from a Bavarian/Austrian family. His name was Maxl, and he eventually married a woman named Gabrielle, who had a sister named Rosalie. The author discovered their identities, but in keeping with Daisy’s diaries, he decided not to name them. He was “a member of an Austro-Hungarian branch of an illustrious Bavarian family which had spread into Wurttemberg and Prussia. Down the centuries its members occupied some of the greatest places in the Holy Roman Empire, and had frequently married in Imperial and Royal Houses.” I never could resist a mystery…I might have to see if I can figure this one out. (90)\n\nWhen the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz committed suicide, gossip said it was at least partly to do with Daisy – he’d fallen for her and obviously couldn’t marry her. The author says this is rubbish, and that’s what I believe, too.\n\nDaisy had multiple sclerosis and became progressively weaker and ultimately paralyzed toward the end of her life. Her devoted caretaker, Dolly Crowther, took care of her until the very end. The author saved the multiple sclerosis diagnosis for the epilogue - not sure why. Within the text, we're just told she had a chronic illness that made it difficult (and later impossible) to walk and that it led to increasing amounts of paralysis.\n\nShould You Read This?\n\nIf you’re interested in World War I, yes. There’s a lot of detail here about Daisy’s efforts to create a bridge of understanding between Britain and Germany in the decade leading up to the war.\n\nDarling Loosy\n\nSubtitle: Letters to Princess Louise 1856-1939\n\nEditor: Elizabeth Longford\n\nPublisher: Weidenfeld & Nicolson\n\nYear: 1991\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI picked up a used copy of this after reading Julia Gelardi’s short book on Prince Alfred’s wedding to Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna. A few of Queen Victoria’s comments on the couple came from letters in this book. So when I saw there were used copies under $10 on Amazon, I bought it.\n\nThis book includes a biographical sketch of Louise by Elizabeth Longford (mother of Lady Antonia Fraser). It’s just under 100 pages, so you get a lot of info there, supplemented by selections of letters addressed to Louise from her childhood through her death. Note that there are no letters from Louise – this collection only includes what people wrote to her.\n\nIt’s interesting, if a bit of a one-sided read. In a few places, where correspondence between other people can illuminate something referred to in the letters to Louise, Longford has included those letters. Examples include Lord Granville to the Queen, and Dean Wellesley to the Queen in 1870, when Louise’s marriage was being debated.\n\nHer most frequent correspondents include:\n\nHer mother, Queen Victoria\n\nHer favorite brother, Prince Arthur\n\nHer other favorite brother, Prince Leopold\n\nHer oldest brother, Prince Edward Albert (later King Edward VII)\n\nHer sister, Princess Victoria\n\nHer sister-in-law, Princess Alexandra\n\nHer husband, Lord Lorne (later Duke of Argyll)\n\nHer nephew, Prince George of Wales (later King George V)\n\nThis collection was interesting, but there were fewer interesting tidbits than I expected. And most of the letters are from her youth. In 311 pages of content, we hit 1920 on page 291. The last 19 years of Louise’s life are represented by a whopping 20 pages. Is that because her correspondence thinned out? I wish I could tell you. I can’t remember which letter it was, but one letter to her mentioned how she hated writing. So the lack of interesting letters might be because she just didn’t enjoy writing them the way her mom and sister did, for example. Or it might be because Longford chose the least controversial letters for the collection. Again, I wish could tell you.\n\nAlthough this was enjoyable to read, I don’t feel like I know Louise any better or learned anything new about her. Let that be your guide if you’re deciding whether or not to get a copy for yourself.\n\nTidbits\n\nPrince Arthur to Louise, 12 August 1869: While in Canada with his regiment, Arthur wrote home to his favorite sister, Louise. “I hope you liked your stay at Invertrossachs, and that you smoked in your bedroom to any amount. I am very glad I was not there…” (110)\n\nQueen Victoria to Louise, 26 January 1872: Apparently, the queen wanted to console Louise for not having any kids yet. She said there was nothing worse than having kids early in marriage. “ANY, ANY thing is preferable to have all destroyed by wicked children – and how far more (in the higher classes) this latter position is far the most common. And you will both admit that any thing is better than that.” Geez, Victoria, tell us how you really feel. (164)\n\nQueen Victoria to Louise, 19 September 1874: With regard to Alfred’s wife, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, Victoria says about Maria’s pregnancy: “May God carry her safely through the great trial which awaits her, and which luckily for her she knows nothing of!” JFC, people, how about lending a girl a little support? And by support, I mean any inkling of what childbirth actually is. It’s horrifying the way women – girls, really – were expected to go through a wedding night, a pregnancy, and childbirth with absolutely zero input or education beforehand. (184)\n\nSir Arthur Sullivan to Louise, private letter dated between 1894 and 1900: Apparently, Sullivan tried to be a good influence on Louise’s brother Alfred before his marriage, but wasn’t able to see him as much after he married. He blamed Alfred’s wife, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, for Alfred’s ongoing alcoholism: “…I saw there was a distinctly hostile element risen up against me, which made me feel very uncomfortable, and always embarrassed. I saw that in any effort I made even to hint or indicate what I thought was judicious or discreet, I got no help whatever from one to whom I desired to be a faithful servant and ally.” (242)\n\nPrince Arthur to Louise, 5 May 1912: “…I am sorry to say that one of our mails went down in the ‘Titanic’ and I believe a letter of yours in it. What an awful catastrophe that was, and to my mind there was no need for it had only proper precautions been taken as soon as news had been received of icebergs…” (272)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you truly enjoy royal correspondence, go for it.\n\nIf you aren’t already into that sort of thing, this probably isn’t the best place to start. I’d suggest Roger Fulford’s compilations of the letters between Queen Victoria and her eldest daughter Vicky first. They’re much more likely to suck you into this world.\n\nback to top\n\nDie Herzen der Leuchtenberg\n\nSubtitle: Geschichte Einer Bayerisch-Napoleonischen Familie\n\nAuthor: Adalbert Prinz von Bayern\n\nPublisher: Nymphenburger\n\nYear: 1991\n\nAvailable at: Abe Books\n\nI bought a used copy of this book because I needed to know more about the man who married Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna of Russia – Max, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg. This book is his family’s story, as told by the historian Prince Adalbert of Bavaria. What better place to look for information than from someone who has access to family information?\n\nThe Leuchtenbergs are a very interesting family. Here’s the scoop:\n\nIn 1806, Napoleon Bonaparte forcibly married his adopted stepson, Eugène de Beauharnais, to Princess Augusta of Bavaria. The idea was to create loyalty among his allies by marrying his family members to theirs. The Bavarian king was horrified, but had no choice as long as he wanted to keep his throne. Despite their arranged marriage, the couple had fallen in love and remained deeply devoted to each other. Augusta realized Eugène was a man of honor and courage. Even though her family shuddered at the thought of his non-royal origins, she saw him for who he was and dedicated herself to supporting him and raising their family. They had six surviving children: Joséphine, Eugénie, August, Amélie, Max, and Theodolinde.\n\nWhen his father-in-law, the King of Bavaria, joined the alliance against Napoleon, Eugène remained loyal to his stepfather. But as we know, loyalty to Napoleon was a losing game. After Napoleon’s fall in 1814, Eugène and Augusta were driven out of Italy. Her father, King Maximilian of Bavaria, took them in and gave them a house in Munich.\n\nAnd now that they were out of the political limelight, Eugène and Augusta were blissfully happy with their family life. But it all came crashing to a halt in 1824, when Eugène had a stroke and died at the young age of 42. Devastated, Augusta devoted herself to his memory – and to making sure that their kids, seen as only half-royal by the rest of Europe, made good marriages and were given the respect they deserved.\n\nThis book is the story of what happened to Augusta and all six kids. They married into the royal houses of Sweden, Russia, and Brazil, among other things. Intrigued yet? ;)\n\nCaveats\n\nNone, really. I read this in translation via DeepL and Google Translate, so I can’t tell you if the prose would blow your mind in the original German. The bulk of the quotations in this book are from the diaries of Princess Augusta and her daughter, Theodolinde. All those entries are in italics. But sometimes the author summarizes their entries and these summaries are not in italics (even though they read just like an entry). It keeps you on your toes.\n\nI will say that I dislike the German formatting standard of not indenting a new paragraph. And the near-complete lack of white space on the page makes me cringe. Visually, this book is a friggin’ wall of text. Indentations and shorter paragraphs are much kinder to the eyes. But I think this is just a cultural context; I’m used to one formatting style, Germans are used to another. YMMV.\n\nAlso, I could have done without the chapter focused on Lola Montez. It feels like a drag on the narrative, but I understand why it’s included. Augusta was involved in the effort to get rid of her, and she is the family matriarch. Skipping this – her last major battle – wouldn’t have been fair to the family. And fairness for the family is all Augusta ever wanted.\n\nTidbits\n\nEugène de Beauharnais inherited Empress Joséphine’s beloved estate of Malmaison when she died. When he died, his oldest son, August, inherited it. But his widow, Princess Augusta, was in charge of the estate until August came of age. And when money became a problem, she decided to sell the estate. August loved his mother, but he hated this decision of hers. He had wanted to live there when he grew up, and always considered himself as much a Frenchman as a Bavarian.\n\nAugusta always noted when her brother – King Ludwig of Bavaria – slighted her family. “She noted with dismay that in her brother's country, unlike with foreign sovereigns, her children received not the slightest attention.” (47) For example, when Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil appointed her son, August, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg as Duke of Santa Cruz (with the title of Royal Highness), Augusta’s brother, King Ludwig, refused to recognize it. A few years later, she wrote in her diary that she was irritated that he “allowed her children to be given different cutlery at family breakfasts. He treats my children like Prince Wallerstein, who is a minister. The royal family has an en vermail couvert, special carafes and glasses. My daughter Theodolinde does not enjoy this distinction, but Eugénie as hereditary princess of Hohenzollern-Hechingen does.” (60; 102)\n\nKing Charles X of France was so paranoid that August (Eugene de Beauharnais’s oldest son) would drum up too many good memories of Napoleon that he forbid August to set foot in Paris. Seeing Paris – the city where his father and grandmother had made history – was one of August’s bucket-list items. “I had hoped to return to Munich tout franç This dream, the fulfillment of which had made me happy, has now flown away ... precisely in France, which I love so much and where it would be my greatest wish to live.” (63)\n\nAugusta’s daughter, Joséphine, married the Crown Prince of Sweden. But court life wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, she wrote. “I think the more you live in the big world, the more you feel the need to go inside and reflect on what you've seen and done. Being in a constant hustle and bustle, in constant motion, always thinking of others, of what is going on around you, if you even have time to think, that's not living ... nowhere do I feel as comfortable as in my big armchair, reflecting on what I have seen, done and thought and conclude that I am learning something.” (92)\n\nAugusta’s eldest son, August, married Queen Maria da Gloria of Portugal. But if his mother had had her way, he’d have married Jerome Bonaparte’s daughter, Mathilde. (95)\n\nAugusta’s youngest daughter, Theodolinde, had teenage crushes on Crown Prince Maximilian of Bavaria and Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (later Napoleon III). It looks like she had a head for business, too, because she got pissed at her mom for telling her not to buy shares a railway line that later more than doubled in value (100 guilders to 220). She wrote in her diary that she was then determined to buy shares in a different railway. (122)\n\nIn 1842, Augusta saw the former Empress Marie Louise of France in Berchtesgaden. Here’s what she wrote in her diary about the run-in: “I had not seen her since 1814. Apparently, God had punished her for forgetting what she owed to the house of Emperor Napoleon, her son and herself. She looks like an old, decrepid, fat and worn-out peasant woman. She is disgusting…This woman, who would have had such a beautiful role if she had followed the example of Empress Maria Theresa, has had a demeanor that puts every woman, and especially the Empress of the French, to shame… I avoided conversation with her.” Augusta is, shall we say, a little judgmental. (253)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you can read German, absolutely. Order an inexpensive used copy and tell the world to get lost for a few days while you absorb the tragic story of a family who didn’t want to conquer the world – they just wanted to represent their founder’s legacy of courage and honor.\n\nDorothea Lieven\n\nSubtitle: A Russian Princess in London and Paris 1785-1857\n\nAuthor: Judith Lissauer Cromwell\n\nPublisher: McFarland & Company, Inc.\n\nYear: 2007\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this book because references to and quotes from Dorothea Lieven are inescapable in the time period I’m researching (early-mid 19th century). Born the daughter of a Baltic baron, she married the son of Charlotte Lieven, governess to Tsar Paul I’s children. When he became the Russian ambassador to Britain, Dorothea took center stage – and her talent turned her marriage into a purgatory.\n\nThe author spent 10 years working on this book after a career on Wall Street. That tells you one thing right off the bat: she has an amateur historian’s passion for her subject (just like yours truly). I love that so much!\n\nA few stylistic quibbles aside, I really enjoyed the way this biography combined politics with the personal aspects of Dorothea’s life. I always enjoy more of these personal aspects. For me, politics can be so dry without that added spice.\n\nIf, like me, you’re interested in snippy remarks between husbands and wives, you get ‘em here. If, like me, you’re interested in how Dorothea kept (or failed to keep) her love affairs separate from her ambition, you get all the details here.\n\nYes, there are a few small mistakes (describing the Winter Palace as white and green at the time of Dorothea’s birth when prior to 1837, it was yellow and white; referring to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna as Princess Louise of Prussia instead of Princess Charlotte; saying Grand Duke Constantine and his wife died at the same time when she survived him by four months), but they’re not dealbreakers.\n\nDorothea played a pretty big role on the world stage from a very young age. Married at age 14 to Christopher Lieven, she lived her entire youth and formative years as the object of his jealousy. She was smarter than he was and pretty much everyone knew it. His mother was Charlotte Lieven, beloved governess of Tsar Paul I’s children – and elevated to the rank of Princess by Tsar Nicholas I.\n\nDorothea herself had been adopted by Empress Maria Feodorovna (Alexander I and Nicholas I’s mom) after being orphaned at a young age. It was Maria who pushed her into the marriage with Christopher Lieven. But Dorothea grew up to be smarter than he was and better at the political maneuverings required to be a good ambassador – and that knowledge ate away at him like rust, destroying the trust and goodwill between them.\n\nDorothea’s two other great loves (because she did love her husband as a young woman, despite the later disintegration of their marriage) were Clement Metternich and François Guizot – two of the century’s premier political influencers.\n\nBecause of her relationships with them, as well her Russian connections, she had a front-row seat to the turbulent politics of the time: the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna, the revolutions of 1830, the growing repression under Tsar Nicholas I in Russia, and the revolutions of 1848. This book takes you through all the political wrangling that underpinned those major world events, through the eyes and words of the woman who knew (and, let’s be honest, influenced) the men who usually get all the credit.\n\nCaveats\n\nNot many. The research here is impressive, with material from archives in England, France, the Czech Republic, and Russia. My only nitpicks are stylistic, which a good editor could have solved easily.\n\nThe author frequently fails to contextualize complete direct quotes. Usually, if you want to use a full quote from a source, you provide not only the quote itself, but more information about that quote: who’s speaking or writing, and who they’re writing or speaking to. It looks something like this: During the great ice cream war of 2166, participants thought it would last forever. “I haven’t had ice cream in 50 years. Well, maybe not actually 50 years, but that’s what it feels like,” wrote King Strawberry to his wife, Queen Pecan Praline. See? You introduce the situation, and then provide both the quote and the WHO and the TO to contextualize the source material.\n\nInstead, this author introduces quotes with a brief context for the situation, but then frequently omits that additional context for the direct quote itself. I had to re-read A LOT of quotes to see if, for example, it was Dorothea or Metternich writing. Here’s what I’m talking about:\n\nExample 1: “Malicious tongues called little George Lieven ‘the child of the congress’ in spite of his birth eleven months after Dorothea last saw Clement. And more. The king adored his namesake because he thought George resembled him. ‘Up to the present he says it is a joke; in a few days he will be saying it meaningfully; later he will let it be understood that he had good reasons for saying it; and, still later, he will persuade himself that he can really take credit – that is how his mind works.’” (65)\n\nSee what I mean? As you read this for the first time, you have no idea who is speaking in that “Up to the present…” quote. Is it George, the Prince Regent? Is it one of Dorothea’s friends reporting on something George said or did? Or is it Dorothea herself? Sure, by the end of the quote, you can intuit that it’s Dorothea, but you can’t be sure when the quote begins since the author just referenced Prince George. It seems like a little thing, but believe me, it causes a lot of confusion. Plus, there’s such an easy fix: “Up to the present,” Dorothea wrote to [letter recipient], “he says it is a joke…”\n\nExample 2: “As for Lord Palmerston, the tables had turned. He immediately pressed the princess to induce Grey to give him the foreign office.\n\n‘I boldly promised to propose him to Lord Grey.’\n\nWhen Grey paid his customary afternoon call…” (129)\n\nHere’s the deal. If you give me two sentences about Lord Palmerston and then give me a direct quote, I’m going to think it’s Lord Palmerston you’re quoting. But no – it’s Dorothea, with no attribution to the quote to clarify. Again, you can figure it out through context, but in a book of this length with as many quotes as this one has, this gets exhausting. And you can’t always assume Dorothea is the speaker/writer, because there are copious quotations from others, too.\n\nThis flaw isn’t consistent – sometimes the author will provide the context, other times she won’t. I’d rather see her err on the side of caution and always make it clear.\n\nThere are a couple stylistic tics that a good editor would have identified and fixed. There are frequent references to flowers blooming to set the scene after a section break or when Dorothea leaves for a trip. It’s a nice touch the first few times, but a dozen or so later, it feels too cutesy. Examples: “Flowers bloomed in colorful profusion under a pellucid sky when the Lievens, traveling in opposite directions, left Warsaw” (127); “When the scent of sun-warmed flowers wafted through the ambient air Princess Lieven sailed southward” (158); “When crocuses pushed their purple petals up through the thawing earth, Tsar Nicholas sent a special envoy to the Hague” (140). Another stylistic issue involves using adverbs to modify nouns (“the poorly princess”) and overuse of the phrase \"let alone.\"\n\nTidbits\n\nIn the early 1800s, as an unfulfilled wife at the Russian imperial court, she had a fling with Grand Duke Constantine. The author describes their hookup as “brief and shallow” but Dorothea said he always treated her in an “amiable, spiritual, gallant” manner afterward. (30)\n\nShe wasn’t above a little bragging to get her lovers to acknowledge her. She wrote to Metternich during one of their separations, “You would not believe how beautiful Italy has made me. You are missing a great deal by not seeing me and no doubt this is the Indian summer of my charm. Fogs and journeys will make me lose it all…” (86)\n\nIn her unpublished memoir, she wrote, “my husband never forgave me for the importance I had.” (159)\n\nHer marriage to Prince Lieven had deteriorated so badly by the time her sons were grown that – without telling her - he banished one of them to America after he felt Constantine had wasted too much time and money on gambling, booze, and women. And then he failed to tell Dorothea when he got news of Constantine’s death in America. She found out when one of her letters to him got returned from America with “DEAD” written on it. Can you imagine?\n\nMetternich wrote to her, “If you were a man, you would be called to the highest destiny. With your head and your heart, one could do anything.” (219)\n\nLater in life, Dorothea wrote letters on green paper because it was easier on her eyes. You’ll see correspondents like Empress Alexandra Feodorovna refer to their joy at getting her “green letters.” (236)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you’re interested in the inner workings of British policy in the early-mid 19th century, yes. There's a lot about politics here, with Whigs and Tories and prime ministers and foreign ministers. If you don't already have an interest in these things, you may start skimming.\n\nIf you’re interested in a woman who could do a hell of a lot more than traditional female roles of the time allowed her to do, yes. I love how many quotes you see throughout the book where men praise her. Kudos to the author for including them and doing the research to find them.\n\nEmbassies of Other Days\n\nVolumes 1 & 2\n\nAuthor: Lady Walburga Paget\n\nPublisher: George H. Doral Company\n\nYear: 1923\n\nAvailable at: AbeBooks\n\nIf you love 19th century royal history, you’ve almost certainly seen quotes from Walburga Hohenthal (later Lady Augustus Paget) in your favorite royal biographies. If you’re like me, you want to go straight to the source of those quotes and read their full context for yourself. I put off buying her memoirs for quite awhile because used copies were a bit expensive ($50-$100). But, with all the talk of inflation lately, I figured nothing is going get cheaper so I’d better bite the bullet and do it. I’m glad I did. There are SO MANY casual references to interesting people and events that it’s going to take quite awhile to sort through them all.\n\nWalburga Hohenthal was born in Saxony in 1839. Her father was Count Charles Hohenthal, who inherited property from the Buenau side of his family – including the estate, Puechau, where Wally grew up. Oh, yes, as she tells us in her first chapter, she was always called “Wally,” pronounced “Vally.”\n\nHer father’s first wife died young of typhoid. His second wife, Countess Loïda Emilie Neidhardt von Gneisenau, was Walburga’s mother. Like many well-off aristocratic families, they did a fair amount of traveling, so she saw The Hague, Ostend, Brussels, Silesia, Dresden, and Weimar. Her father was good friends with Ernst of Saxe-Coburg, Prince Albert’s brother, and her mom was besties with Sophie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Saxe-Weimar.\n\nBut her childhood happiness was short-lived. Her mother died when she was only 15, and she moved to Berlin as the ward of her uncle, Adolph Hohenthal. There, the Prince of Prussia (later Kaiser Wilhelm I) asked her family to let Wally be a Maid of Honor to his future daughter-in-law, Princess Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland (Vicky). So when the time came, Wally went to England and joined Vicky’s household prior to her marriage – despite Wally still being an unmarried teenager, not the usual situation for a Maid of Honor.\n\nTwo years later, she left Vicky’s service when she married Lord Augustus Paget, a British diplomat.\n\nAs an ambassador, her husband was stationed in Copenhagen, Italy, and Austria-Hungary between the years 1860 and 1893. Talk about a gold mine for royal research! She got to know King Christian IX and his family while in Copenhagen, King Umberto and Queen Margherita while in Italy, and everyone from the Duke of Cumberland to Crown Prince Rudolf in Vienna. Not a bad contact list, right? ;)\n\nShe began writing this eventual 2-volume memoir in 1884, while her husband was stationed in Vienna. In the second volume, she transitions from a true narrative memoir to entries from her diary that cover her later years in Vienna. The second volume contains a lot of detail about British politics, which I skimmed, if I’m being honest. But there are plenty of fascinating tidbits about people and life in Britain, Prussia, Saxony, Copenhagen, Rome, Florence, and Vienna. It’s part travelogue, part gossip column, part life story of a fascinating woman. What’s not to like?\n\nTidbits\n\nSeriously, there are so many casual mentions of royalty and nobility that I lost count.\n\nIn a letter to her father in August of 1841, her mother reported a storm so intense that it would have killed her and the three kids had they been out in. Wally notes that she remembered “such huge hailstones crashing through the windows that they could not be forced into a German beer glass.” This reminded me of the death of Dorothea, Duchess de Dino, who had been pelted by just such a hailstorm in 1861 and, after returning home bleeding and feverish, never really recovered. (24)\n\nHer mother was friends with Sophie, Grand Duchess of Saxe-Weimar (sister-in-law of the acerbic Queen Sophie of the Netherlands). When Wally’s mom died, Sophie even volunteered to take Wally in, but she didn’t want to be separated from her sisters. Instead, as wards of their uncle, Adolph Hohenthal (Saxon minister to Prussia), they went to Berlin. Later, when she became a lady-in-waiting to Princess Victoria, she felt a little guilty because she’d accepted that position but not Sophie’s offer of a place at her own court. When she explained it to Sophie, she said Sophie showed her nothing but “unselfish kindness and affection.” (60)\n\nWhen she first met Vicky’s future husband, Prince Frederic William, he wasn’t the hottie he later became. According to Wally, “At twenty-seven he was still undeveloped, even in appearance, and nobody could foresee how handsome a man he would be ten years later, when he had filled out and the long golden beard made him look like one of Wagner’s heroes of romance.” (70-1)\n\nAs part of Wally’s sightseeing in England prior to Vicky’s wedding, she and her fellow ladies-in-waiting went to the Tower of London: “Yesterday in the morning we went to the Tower: I laid my head on the block on which formerly prisoners – and I think also Lady Jane Grey – were beheaded. It was a very peculiar feeling, and one almost thinks one feels the axe.” (79)\n\nIn Berlin, as a young lady-in-waiting, Wally demonstrated her acting ability by showing fellow lady-in-waiting Lady Jane Churchill and “some of the gentlemen” how to do a perfect faint. So of course, the rest of the gang had to give it a try. But so many thuds on the floor scared the crap out of the woman who lived on the floor below them, Princess Frederic Charles, who sent a page up to ask what was going on. (91)\n\nOn a visit with Fritz and Vicky to Gotha, Wally was bored on a rainy day. Her solution? “It poured nearly all the time, so, to beguile the dragging hours, as I was without my usual occupations, I dressed myself up as a ghost, and very successfully frightened a certain number of people.” (96) I’m cracking up here.\n\nSpeaking of practical jokes, she could foil them as well as dish them out. Wally notes that the future Kaiser Wilhelm I loved teasing the ladies-in-waiting and “had a habit of pulling our bonnet strings, which in those days were seldom tied neatly. I was, however, very particular on this point, and used to fasten them with two pins, which defeated him entirely; but I have seen a whole row of Maids of Honour with their bonnet strings hanging down after the Regent had passed them.” (100) I’m still cracking up…Wally shows the moments of humor and color behind staid, boring court life.\n\nSee? I’ve only gotten to page 100 to see what I underlined on my first pass, and this is just a fraction of what’s there.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you like slice-of-life glimpses of aristocratic life in 19th century Europe, yes.\n\nIf you want offhanded tidbits about Prussian, Italian, or Austrian royalty, yes.\n\nOr if you want a behind-the-scenes look at British politics in the 1870s and 1880s, yes.\n\nback to top\n\nEmperor Francis Joseph\n\nSubtitle: Life, Death and the Fall of the Habsburg Empire\n\nAuthor: John Van der Kiste\n\nPublisher: The History Press\n\nYear: 2013 (originally published in 2005)\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought a digital copy of this book because I’ve really enjoyed several other Van der Kiste books (and the royal memoirs he’s been republishing for those of us who crave that sort of thing). I liked this book, too – it had a great balance between the political and the personal.\n\nFranz Josef became Emperor of Austria thanks to the revolution of 1848. Although second in line for the throne, his father was urged to abdicate in his favor – turbulent times called for someone younger and more energetic, and his son fit the bill. From 1848 to 1916, Franz Josef was the living embodiment of a soon-to-be-vanished empire and way of life.\n\nDevoted to duty, he was determined to carry it out faithfully at all times. And that’s exactly what he did, sometimes to the detriment of his personal relationships. After his son Rudolf died by suicide, many said he was heartless – he hadn’t shown the boy enough love, didn’t show enough grief or remorse afterward. But if your duty was to NOT do those things, to remain aloof and dignified at all times, why would you have?\n\nHe grieved in private and did his best not to let the world see how the many tragedies in his life affected him. And good lord, were there a lot of tragedies: first child died young, younger brother executed, son died by suicide, wife assassinated, nephew assassinated…the hits just kept on coming. I waver between thinking Franz Josef was too hands-off in his personal life and thinking that he held himself to a different standard because of his rank. This book can’t really help you make that judgment call – but it can give you some evidence to help you make up your own mind.\n\nCaveats\n\nNone, really – just a couple minor quibbles and an observation, but overall, the book is well done.\n\nI didn’t like the way he described Emperor Franz’s second wife, Maria Theresa of Bourbon-Naples. He described her as “mentally deranged and extremely ugly.” I know nothing about Maria Theresa and don’t have a mental picture of what she looked like (without going to look one up). But even so, this description seems both nonspecific and unkind. What makes someone “extremely” ugly? And “deranged” – what does that even mean? If it indicates a mental illness, why not just say that? I’d expect that kind of language in, say, a 19th or early 20th century biography…but the first edition of this was published in 2005, and the new digital edition in 2013. This was probably before things like sensitivity readers were available, but reading those phrases in 2022 made me cringe. (12)\n\nThere’s one mix-up between Archduchess Maria Josepha and Maria Theresa. He mentions “Francis Ferdinand’s stepmother Maria Josepha,” when he means Maria Theresa. Maria Josepha was his sister-in-law. (272)\n\nIf you’re already pretty familiar with Franz Josef’s story, this probably won’t shed any more light on him for you. There is original research here from British archives, relating to what Queen Victoria and British ambassadors said about or thought about the Austrian empire and its rulers, but for the most part, this book uses previously published sources. That’s not a drawback – unless, as I said, you’ve already read sources by authors including Corti, Brook-Shepherd, Gribble, Hamann, Haslip, Ketterl, Margutti, Palmer, and Redlich. If you already know which books I’m referring to just by the authors’ names, you're who I’m talking about in this caveat.\n\nTidbits\n\nFranz Josef’s mother, Sophie, was a twin – one of two pairs of twin girls born to King Maximilian I of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden (his second wife). With a total of five sisters who “had a reputation for being strong-willed and authoritarian by nature…the Prussian historian Heinrich von Treitschke would later refer to them collectively as ‘the Bavarian sisters of woe.’” (13) I kind of want that on a T-shirt now. Or for that to be a band name.\n\nFranz Josef’s father, Franz Karl, fell for his mom before she fell for him. He seems like a non-entity, without any particular talent or interest, but who was kind and loving. Except for when his mother-in-law described him as “really terrible…he would bore me to death. Every now and then I would want to hit him.” (14) Violence is not the answer, Caroline. You know that.\n\nWhen Italy was united and the monarchs of the Two Sicilies were driven out of the country, Franz Josef offered them a place in Vienna. This led to the following funny moment: “With the possibility that Vienna might become a home for exiled royalties from Italy and other neighbouring states, the nineteen-year-old Archduke Ludwig Victor remarked one night at a dinner that all the royal highnesses who were expelled from their dominions came to them. ‘I wonder where we will go when we are driven away?’ he asked disingenuously.” (82) LOL.\n\nThis probably isn’t interesting to anyone but me, but this is my website, so you’re stuck with me. I already knew that when Princess Stephanie of Belgium got engaged to Archduke Rudolf, Franz Josef’s heir, the wedding had to be postponed because she hadn’t gotten her period yet. But Van der Kiste quoted Empress Elisabeth as calling Stephanie “an unformed child.” (161) This rang a bell for me because I’d seen a reference to another royal woman referred to as “unformed” and I didn’t know what it meant. When applied to a teenage or pre-teen girl, does “unformed” always mean that she hasn’t hit puberty yet? Or was Elisabeth’s usage a one-off? Enquiring minds want to know.\n\nWhen the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII) visited Vienna, he had too much energy for Franz Josef. During a shoot in Hungary and military maneuvers in Croatia, Franz Josef tried to ditch the prince by riding faster (trotting and galloping). It didn’t work. “The fat man was always with me and held out quite unbelievably, only he got very stiff and tore his red Hussar trousers and, as he was wearing nothing underneath, that must have been very uncomfortable for him.” (177) Yes. Yes, indeed. It’s a little weird sitting here in 2022 wondering whether royals wore underwear, but there you have it. Be careful what you write, people. It could end up in the hands of nosy readers a hundred years later.\n\nTo express disapproval of Franz Josef’s platonic but extremely close relationship with actress Katharina Schratt, “one of the junior archdukes” called him “Herr Schratt” to his face. (222) We’re not told which one, and there’s no footnote to go see where this tidbit came from, unfortunately. L\n\nOne time, at band camp…er, at Franz Ferdinand’s house (unclear whether it’s the Belvedere or Konopischt)…he led his party guests through the place in a conga line “only to come face to face with Sophie’s recently washed underwear hung by the maid to dry on a chandelier.” (230)\n\nThrifty Archduchess Gisela (Franz Josef’s daughter) used to take spare candles home from the Hofburg, where fresh ones were provided for the chandeliers every day even if the previous day’s candles were untouched. (232) Now that’s just being practical. Way to go, Gisela.\n\nI was impressed to read that, when traveling in the Austro-Hungarian empire, the devout Catholic Franz Josef always visited churches belonging to other faiths: Protestant, Orthodox, Islamic, and Jewish. Didn’t know that about him – but it made me like him more. (255)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYep.\n\nFranz Josef’s reign spanned an incredible length of time. If you have any interest in 19th century history, World War I, or Austrian history, this is a no-brainer. It’s an easy read, well written, and a good starting point for the Habsburg story.\n\nEna and Bee\n\nSubtitle: Queen Victoria’s Spanish Granddaughters\n\nAuthor: Ana de Sagrera\n\nTranslator: Iain Dorward Steward\n\nPublisher: Fonthill\n\nYear: 2022 (originally published in Spanish in 2006)\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI gifted myself this eBook with an Amazon gift card I got from work for Christmas. Having read only a couple books about Spain and Queen Victoria Eugenia (a granddaughter of Queen Victoria), I wanted to know more. Plus, this book hit the sweet spot of also covering a royal I didn’t know much about – Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, also a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and sister of Queen Marie of Romania.\n\nThe whole world waited with bated breath to find out who King Alfonso XIII of Spain would marry. When, in 1905, he chose Princess Victoria Eugenia (Ena) of Battenberg, it was a surprise. Ena was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, but her father was the product of a morganatic marriage – which many believed made her unsuitable for the throne of Spain. But it was a love match, and Alfonso didn’t care – or so he thought at the time.\n\nLater, one of Alfonso XIII’s cousins, Infante Alfonso of Orleans, fell in love with Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Ena’s cousin. But because Beatrice was firmly Protestant, Spanish authorities refused to allow the marriage. Although he personally approved, Alfonso’s hands were tied. So Alfonso (Ali) and Beatrice (Bee) took matters into their own hands and married outside of Spain.\n\nInitially, they were exiled for marrying without the proper approval (and, unofficially, out of spite for Bee’s refusal to convert to Catholicism). Eventually, they were forgiven and welcomed back to Madrid, where Bee and Ena resumed their childhood friendship. They resumed it so well that it offended the strict etiquette of the Spanish court.\n\nTo us, it seems normal that you’d want to hang out with your best friend all the time. But Spanish court etiquette had strict rules about who got to spend time with the queen.\n\nAnd when Ena flouted some of those rules to spend more time with Bee, it pissed some of those court officials off. So much so that they attacked Bee and tried to drive a wedge between the two women. They failed to do that, but a cabal did manage to drive a wedge between Bee’s husband and King Alfonso. (There’s a lot more to it than that, but I’m trying not to spoil the story for you.) So Ali and Bee were exiled a second time. Once again, they were eventually allowed to return and remained there until a revolution turned Spain into a republic and drove the royal family out of the country.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Bee did what she could from the borderlands. After the war, she and Ali were finally able to settle permanently in Sanlúcar, where she founded a maternity hospital and devoted her time to her family and to charity.\n\nThe author, Ana de Sagrera, met Bee after becoming well-known in Spain for her biography of Queen Maria de las Mercedes, the short-lived true love of Alfonso XIII’s father. It’s fascinating to read this knowing the author actually met her subject, as well as spoke to many of Bee and Ali’s friends and descendants.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this book. It’s entertaining, and covers a lot of ground I’d never read about in other books. If, like me, you’d seen references to Bee as a troublemaker at the Spanish court, this book tells the real story – and explains why that lingering image isn’t true at all.\n\nCaveats\n\nJust one, really. Perhaps it’s due to the effects of translation, but there were times when sentences referred to two women (usually both Ena and Bee), and it was hard to untangle who the “she” referred to was.\n\nTidbits\n\nBee’s first love was her Russian cousin, Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich (younger brother of Nicholas II). But the Russian imperial family didn’t approve, and although Mikhail kept writing to her for months, the romance fizzled. “They do not want me to care for you,” he wrote her. (116) Bee’s family felt Michael led her on, and Bee herself seems to have felt that Mikhail was too weak to stand up to his parents.\n\nGrand Duke Boris of Russia, a cousin of Mikhail’s proposed to Ena but she turned him down. (125)\n\nBee first met her future husband, Ali, during the celebrations for Ena’s wedding in Madrid in 1906. Grand Duke Vladimir, her uncle, introduced them at a ball. That very night, the first time they danced together, he asked if she would marry him. Her response? She slapped him. Violence is never the answer, but I found that amusing. Years later, he said he did it because it was the best way he could think of to make her remember him in a ballroom full of other potential suitors. (138)\n\nAlready in love for two years but forbidden to marry by Spanish court law and etiquette (because Bee was a Protestant), Bee and Ali had to resort to some “strategery” to force the issue. Ali planned to visit Bee in Coburg on the way to fight in Morocco in July of 1909. Because the Catholic church has a dispensation called “Partida de la Mort,” the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha thought they could marry without permission. It was a rushed wedding, with a civil marriage first followed by a Catholic ceremony. King Alfonso wasn’t happy about it, because even though he’d given personal verbal permission for it, he wasn’t officially able to sanction it without the government’s consent (per the Spanish Constitution). Ali’s father was so shocked he sent Ali a telegram to say “all is finished between us.” (169) Ouch.\n\nBee designed the emblem for the then-new Spanish Air Force. It consisted of “large feathers, with a golden sun in the centre to be embroidered on the aviators’ green uniforms…Curiously the Spanish Emblem would be copied by the British Royal Air Force and other countries.” (211)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. Whether you’re interested in Queen Victoria’s descendants, a few tidbits of Russian history, Spanish history, or general European royal history, there’s something for everyone here.\n\nThe Fall of the Dynasties\n\nSubtitle: The Collapse of the Order 1905-1922\n\nAuthor: Edmond Taylor\n\nPublisher: Congregation Press\n\nYear: 2017 (this eBook edition; originally published in 1963)\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nApparently, I bought this eBook twice – while scanning my unread titles, I found two versions on my Kindle. Since I’m incredibly cheap and rely almost exclusively on BookBub deals, I’m pretty sure I only paid a buck or two for each copy. Not gonna chalk this up as an L for that very reason.\n\nI bought this book because it shows up in lots of bibliographies. It specifically looks at the reasons for the fall of four dynasties during and after World War I: the Hohenzollerns in Germany, the Habsburgs in Austria-Hungary, the Romanovs and Russia, and the Ottomans in Turkey. It’s a decent summary of the political scene before the war, during the war, and shortly after the war. The book didn’t break any new ground for me, but that’s probably because of the huge amount of material on World War I published since 1963 (the first edition of this book). Any modern reader already interested in WWI has probably already read several books like this one.\n\nWhat makes this book different is the inclusion of the Ottomans – usually far more on the periphery than in this book.\n\nAlso, the author isn’t shy about including some personal opinions, as you can see by his description of Kaiser Wilhelm II: “A born ham with a compulsive urge for the mock-heroic gesture, Wilhelm ranted and postured like some men drink. His whole life was a series of charades that he acted out with self-applauding zest before a captive audience of European diplomats and crowned heads unable to take their eyes off the grotesque performance for a moment lest fate punish the mountebank by accepting one of his impersonations at its face value, thus turning farce into real tragedy.”(30)\n\nThis style of opinionated storytelling isn’t as popular today as it was in the 1960s – I’d like to think we’re a lot more respectful today, and more interested in advancing understanding than proving oneself right. So if you’re not used to the style, it might be offputting at first. However, if you're like me, it's interesting seeing who and what people blame for WWI, so an opinionated style can actually be useful.\n\nTidbits\n\nIn pre-war Vienna, public dance halls were popular night spots. “One, claiming to be the largest in Europe, maintained a fully equipped emergency maternity room for the convenience of its female patrons.” (25) WTF.\n\nWhen, in 1866, Austria lost its Italian provinces, ex-Emperor Ferdinand (who had been forced to abdicate in 1848), supposedly said, “Is this what they made me abdicate for? I could have lost those provinces myself.” (59) This quote made me laugh, and if it’s true (Taylor presents it as if it is), refutes the description I’ve seen elsewhere of Ferdinand as severely mentally disabled.\n\n“Once when Kaiser Wilhelm II, who had been invited to attend an important Austro-Hungarian field exercise, asked the Imperial Chief of Staff if he might have some champagne with his meals, Francis Joseph indignantly forbade it. ‘Not a drop,’ he growled, ‘let him drink beer.’” (62)\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II apparently wished American millionaires would leave him money: “Sometimes,” he wrote his friend, Poultney Bigelow, the son of an American diplomat with whom he had played Indians in childhood, “I wish one of your millionaires would have the splendid idea on his deathbed of willing his fortune to me.” (101) Was this tongue-in-cheek? Maybe. Taylor doesn’t present it as that way. He is not fond of the Kaiser.\n\nAustria’s Foreign Minister, Count Leopold Berchtold (“Poldi”) had “a mania of drinking iced coffee (brought up specially from Demel’s Café) at all hours of the day.” (133) So what’s your point? ;) Iced coffee is good, dude.\n\nApparently, some in high society were taken completely unaware by WWI. “When the detonator finally went off, on July 23, the statesmen and the diplomats were only slightly less surprised than the novelist Elinor Glyn, then at the height of her slightly scandalous success, who commented with asperity on the bad manners of the Austrian Ambassador in rushing away from a weekend house party in a chateau near Paris at which they were fellow guests. Anthony Glyn relates in his entertaining biography of his famous grandmother that when Fielder, Elinor’s chauffeur, suggested the disappearance of the Ambassador was possibly a sign of impending war, ‘everyone searched hurriedly in the newspapers to see what he could mean and with whom the war could be.’ (136)\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you’re obsessed with World War I, yes. If you’re not, you can probably skip this one – unless, like me, you obsessively stalk bibliographies of other books.\n\nMaria Nikolayevna\n\nFull Title: Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna and Her Palace in St. Petersburg\n\nAuthor: Zoia Belyakova\n\nPublisher: EGO Publishers\n\nYear: 1994\n\nAvailable at: Amazon (used)\n\nI bought this book because I wanted to know more about the daughters of Nicholas I: Maria, Olga, and Adini. Maria was the most elusive - I'd already read Olga's memoir, and it provided a lot of information about Adini. Maria, however, was a few years older than Olga and that gap set her apart, enough to make getting to know her through Olga's memoir difficult. I was hoping this book could shed some more light on her.\n\nWhat's unique about Maria and her palace? As with princesses in other countries, Russian grand duchesses were expected to marry outside of Russia. Unless something went wrong, they were never expected to live in Russia and need a household of their own there. Grand dukes, on the other hand, had palaces built or bought for them as adults, usually as a precursor to marriage (so they'd have a place to start a family).\n\nBut Maria was different.\n\nThe oldest and most headstrong daughter of Tsar Nicholas I, she refused to marry outside of Russia and leave her homeland. So when she married Maximilian, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg, he settled in Russia with her. When that happened, she needed a palace of her own. As Nikolai Karamzin notes in the introduction, there were 23 Romanov grand duchesses - of whom, only 8 remained in Russia. Maria was the first.\n\nBecause Maria was Nicholas I's favorite daughter, he built her a spectacular palace facing St. Isaac's Square, called the Maryinsky Palace. It was the only Russian palace built for a grand duchess.\n\nThis book isn't a biography - it's more of a coffee table book full of gorgeous photos of Maria's palace, with chapters that briefly cover her life, family, and descendants. To be honest, the first used copy of this I found online was around $70 and I passed. About a year later, I saw another copy for $40 and pulled the trigger with some Christmas money. When I posted this in January of 2022, there was a used copy on Amazon available for $25. Score!\n\nThe photos are amazing. The book includes historical photos (pre-WWII) as well as modern photos, so you can see the changes that have been made to the palace since it was built for Maria in 1839-1844. The author includes paintings, engravings, photos – anything available to show you what the Maryinsky Palace looked like when it was built, after the Revolution, and now. The beginning of the book also includes images of other grand ducal palaces for comparison’s sake (the Marble Palace, Michael Pavlovich’s Palace, Nicholas Nikolayevich’s palace, etc.).\n\nCaveats\n\nNone – this book is exactly what is says it is: an in-depth look at a particular palace, gorgeously illustrated with supplementary information about Maria’s family and descendants. It’s not in-depth biographical information, but that was never the book’s intent. Enjoy it for the amazing photos and the story of the only palace built for a Russian grand duchess.\n\nTidbits\n\nOf the 23 Romanov grand duchesses, 8 remained in Russia: Maria (the subject of this book), Nicholas I's niece Maria (who died young and unmarried and I don't think should count, as her mother would have married her off eventually - trust me on that one), Nicholas II's sister Olga Alexandrovna, Nicholas II's sister Xenia Alexandrovna, and Nicholas II's four daughters.\n\nMaria’s trousseau was sewn by Russian girls attending Sunday trade schools under the auspices of the Patriots’ Society, founded by Empress Elisabeth Alexeievna. They earned 9,000 rubles for the job. (18)\n\nOne time, Maria and her father, Nicholas I, had a staring contest. Nicholas was known for his intimidating gaze – but Maria inherited his ability to stare down an opponent. According to Alexander Herzen, the contest was a draw because Maria matched him glower f"
