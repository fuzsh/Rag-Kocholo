This book came up a winner, and it wasn’t until after I’d finished that I even realized it’s by the same woman who wrote Ambition and Desire (Josephine Bonaparte), which I really liked. This book had the same quick pacing and enjoyable style – not academic, but not a slouch in the research department, either.\n\nThis book has two clear trajectories: (a) the brief life and early death of Princess Charlotte, and (b) the birth, childhood, and reign of Queen Victoria until her first son was born, securing the throne. One would probably not have existed without the other, which is why these stories need to be told in tandem. It’s not a full biography of either woman, but it’s definitely everything you need to know to understand how and why the throne passed to Victoria.\n\nAs a super-quick recap, Princess Charlotte was the only daughter and heiress of King George IV. Because of his deep and abiding loathing for his wife, there was never any possibility of a sibling for Charlotte. She survived the trials and tribulations of childhood and grew up a strong-willed, tomboyish child starved for affection. Both of her parents used her in their epic battles with each other and with the royal family at large (her grandfather was King George III and her grandmother was Queen Charlotte, of Bridgerton fame).\n\nIt’s a miracle this kid grew up any kind of sane – but she did. And after refusing to marry her father’s choice of husband, the Prince of Orange, she drifted from fling to fling and finally settled on Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. Handsome, grounded, and willing to move to England full-time, Leopold was just what Charlotte needed. His steadiness calmed her down, and his affection gave her confidence. She, in turn, charmed him, helped him loosen up, and gave him an identity and a purpose beyond an impoverished younger son. Until, that is, she died giving birth to their first child, who was stillborn.\n\nSuddenly, with the only heiress to the throne gone, all Charlotte’s uncles raced to the altar and then the bedroom to try and provide a legitimate heir. Victoria’s father won that race, and the rest, as they say, is history. The Victoria section of the book goes into detail about how her mother, the Duchess of Kent, tried her hardest to keep Victoria’s public image squeaky clean – and to keep herself in the limelight as long as humanly possible. With, as you’d guess, the expected deleterious result to her relationship with her daughter. As with Charlotte, it’s a bit of a miracle this kid turned out sane, too. Luckily, her determination to do the right thing was stronger than her mother’s greed.\n\nIf you want a more complete story about the madness of King George and how it affected his family, read A Royal Experiment by Janice Hadlow. That book really sets the stage for this one – and both are incredibly readable. Princesses by Flora Fraser also covers a lot of the same territory, from the point of view of the aunts Charlotte loathes.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. This is a fascinating look at first Charlotte and then young Victoria. I didn’t find much new information, but Williams’s telling felt full and complete.\n\nTidbits\n\nPrincess Charlotte’s mother, Caroline of Brunswick, didn’t exactly kill it on the European marriage market. Years before, when Queen Charlotte heard that her brother – the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz – was considering proposing to Caroline, she wrote to him and was like, nope, don’t do it, for the love of God, don’t do it. And he didn’t. But when the next prospective bridegroom was her own son, Charlotte kept her mouth shut since Caroline’s mom was also her sister-in-law. (16)\n\nThink your ex is petty? Prince George – later George IV – hated Caroline of Brunswick so much that he “removed chairs from her private dining room, saying he could not afford to pay for them, and took back the pearl bracelets he had given her on their wedding day, presenting them instead to his beloved Lady Jersey.” (24) What a dick.\n\nWilliams’s description of the Prince of Orange cracked me up. “’Slender Billy,’ as the Prince of Orange was known by his fellow soldiers, had never cut much of a dash…He had returned to Holland in 1813 as crown prince, a short, skinny, and ugly youth with buck teeth and wispy blond hair, and a diffident and indecisive character.” (78)\n\nCharlotte had a crush on Emperor Alexander I of Russia. “My ears are very ugly, but I would give them both to persuade the Emperor to come to me to a ball, a supper, any entertainment that he would choose.” Except that when Charlotte saw him, he told her to marry the Prince of Orange. Facepalm. (87)\n\nNapoleon had declared Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg “the handsomest man who had ever entered his Palace of the Tuileries,” according to Williams. (89)\n\nPrincess Mary (one of Charlotte’s many single aunts) had the hots for Leopold, too. Once Charlotte realized this, it made her more attracted to him.\n\nWhen Charlotte’s baby was born dead, Williams notes: “The infant was taken directly to St. George’s Chapel and not given any service, according to the principle that stillborn children had no soul and thus needed no prayers.” (138) This struck me as so sad.\n\nTsar Alexander of Russia said he wanted to be a godparent to the Duke of Kent’s new baby, which traditionally meant the baby had to bear his name. That’s why Victoria’s real first name was Alexandrina. The parents had wanted to name her Victoire Georgiana Alexandrina Charlotte Augusta, but the Prince Regent (future George IV) was like, nope, don’t like it, you can’t use that. At the christening, he said the child’s name should be Alexandrina. He vetoed Kent’s suggestion of Elizabeth for a second name, and said they could use the mother’s name, but only if it didn’t come before the emperor’s. Hence…Alexandrina Victoria. (157-8)\n\nI chuckled at Princess Lieven’s comment after the Duke of Kent’s death, regarding the twice-widowed 32-year-old Duchess of Kent: “She kills all her husbands.” (163)\n\nVictoria is a girl after my own heart. Once, when the Duchess of Clarence (future Queen Adelaide) asked her what she wanted for her birthday, Victoria said she wanted the windows at Kensington Palace cleaned. I want my windows cleaned for my birthday, too. I feel seen. (172)\n\nBack to top\n\nCatherine the Great\n\nAuthor: Simon Dixon\n\nPublisher: Ecco\n\nYear: 2009\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought a used copy of this book several years ago, while researching Princess Augusta of Brunswick (who moved to Russia with her husband, Duke Friedrich of Württemberg). Because Augusta spent the last years of her life at Catherine’s court, I wanted as much information about it as possible and ordered a handful of Catherine books. I’m just now getting to some of them, and this one didn’t disappoint.\n\nThis is a traditional cradle-to-grave biography. The prologue covers Catherine’s coronation, to give you a sense of “how it’s going” and then jumps back to her childhood (“how it started”). The level of detail in that coronation prologue is enchanting, immersing you in the time and place. It begins with a quote from a Swedish prisoner of war complaining about the ringing bells of St. Petersburg’s Peter & Paul Cathedral – and proceeds to describe how much more intense the bells in Moscow rang during Catherine’s coronation. From the bells, we proceed to a description of what Catherine wore, the route she took to her coronation, where troops were stationed throughout the area, how the nearby houses had been decorated. See what I mean? It’s incredibly visual, and a good way to begin Catherine’s story.\n\nDixon focuses on Catherine’s mind – what she wrote, her goals, and her dreams. This was a welcome change from, say, focusing on her lovers, like many 19th century writers did. It elevates the book, not to mention doing the hard work of really helping us see who Catherine was. Think PBS, not TMZ – but at the same time, the writing isn’t dry or scholarly or boring. There are endnotes (thank goodness), but I never felt lost or confused as I sometimes do when writers get too deep into the nitty-gritty of Russian politics. The whole book feels calm and balanced, a pleasure to read.\n\nThroughout the book, Dixon gives you details about the buildings, architecture, art, and décor to give you a sense of how things looked at the time. The whole thing is immersive and visual, which I appreciated. And it’s fitting, since Catherine wrote to her friend Baron Grimm, “Building is a devilish thing. It devours money, and the more one builds, the more one wants to go on. It is a sickness, like drinking, and a sort of habit.” (260) So when Catherine gleefully tells Grimm that her renovated rooms in Tsarskoe Selo’s Catherine Palace are awesome – “no one has seen anything to match them; I can tell you that I have done nothing but look at them for the last nine weeks” – you actually want to read the descriptions of the silk in the Lyon room, the red and green foil in her study, and the Chinese jars in the Chinese room. Because it all meant something to Catherine, it means something to us as the reader.\n\nDixon also has a knack for picking excellent quotes from source material to illustrate a point. For example, as Catherine sets out on her journey to Russia to marry the heir to the throne, Dixon uses a quote from Isabella of Parma (bride of the Austrian emperor) to describe what a princess feels in this situation: “There she is, condemned to abandon everything, her family, her country – and for whom? For an unknown person, whose character and manner of thinking she does not know.” (36) As a writer, I like Dixon’s choice here. Even though Isabella of Parma has nothing to do with Catherine’s story, her quote helps us to understand what Catherine might have been feeling. It’s a much more effective way to describe a situation than the author simply saying, “Catherine might have been feeling X,” or “She surely felt Y.” That kind of authorial intrusion can be annoying, and I like how Dixon avoided that pitfall.\n\nAll this to say…Dixon’s is a very grown-up biography. It mentions Catherine’s lovers when they’re important to the story, as when her grief for Lanskoy sidelined her for weeks in 1784. When those lovers aren’t important to the story, they get mostly passed over. There are no prurient details, but you don’t need them because the star of the show isn’t Catherine’s personal life. It’s the life of her mind. And it’s fascinating.\n\nDixon also delivers an elegant smackdown to illustrate how some negative views of Catherine’s personal life had hidden agendas. In addressing the French courtier Corberon’s assessment that Catherine was ruining Russia with her morals, her spending, and her weak and romantic feminine nature, Dixon replies: “Generally the preserve of foreigners, and provoked most often by the failure of a particular ambassador’s diplomacy at St. Petersburg, such verdicts owed more to stereotypical assumptions about female rule than to the realities of Catherine’s reign.” (244) BURN. I love it.\n\nTidbits\n\n“Female rule had been associated with bravery in Russia since Catherine I’s legendary role at the battle of the Pruth in 1711, and Elizabeth’s clerical mythmakers duly seized on the image to portray their empress as ‘Peter’s daughter.’” (77) Elizabeth was Peter the Great’s daughter, the Empress of Russia when Catherine arrived to marry Peter. I have no idea what happened at that battle, but now I want to find out.\n\n“Reputed to be the first private individual in Russia to plant his own pineapple orchard, Elizabeth’s principal minister Peter Shuvalov had its fruit fermented into wine and once served a dessert in the form of a mountain studded with precious stones from his own mineralogical collection.” (96)\n\nCatherine’s husband, Tsar Peter III, issued an edict freeing the nobility from mandatory state service. There are several origin stories for this edict, including this hilarious one: “Prince Scherbatov famously claimed that the tsar had locked Dimitry Volkov, one of Elizabeth’s leading officials, into a palace stateroom with a great dane and told him to come up with something important overnight while he went off to carouse with Princess Kurakina…” (118) Dude. I used to have a great dane. Great danes are gentle giants – they are not going to hurt anyone. They are more likely to cower in fear. My great dane cowered in fear at the sight of mailboxes, balloons, garbage cans, recycling bins, and anything else on the sidewalk where we walked.\n\n“It was in her library [in the Winter Palace] that Catherine had scientific experiments set up for visiting ambassadors, using apparatus such as the ‘small electrical machine’ with which her son enjoyed electrocuting his servants.” (138) This reminds me of a story in Christian Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin’s memoirs, where he talks about learning to shock people after scuffing his feet on carpet and proceeding to shock the hell out of the German ambassador.\n\nDixon notes that a Catherine’s Tale of Tsarevich Khlor (written for her grandchildren) was “the first children’s story to be written in the Russian language.” (249) I really wish this sentence had added “that we know of” or “published for a commercial audience.” The first one written in Russian, period, seems like a claim no one can verify.\n\nIn the late 1780s, Catherine put together a “comparative etymological dictionary,” aimed at discovering common word origins in the world’s languages. She wrote to world leaders everywhere and asked for information about native languages in their area. “Invited to contribute lists of Native American words by the marquis de Lafayette, George Washington replied in May 1786 that he would do his best to help Catherine, ‘but she must have a little patience – the Indian tribes on the Ohio are numerous, dispersed & distant from those who are most likely to do the business properly.’” (275) The book was published in 1787 – and now I wonder if Washington ever got back to her.\n\nThe French ambassador, Ségur, included something cool Catherine said in his memoir: “’More is to be learned, she said to me one day, ‘by speaking to ignorant persons about their own affairs, than by talking with the learned, who have nothing but theories, and who would be ashamed not to answer you by ridiculous observations on subjects of which they have no positive knowledge. How I pity these poor savans! They never dare to pronounce these four words, I do not know, which we ignorant people find so convenient, and which often prevent us from adopting dangerous decisions, for, in a doubtful case, it is much better to do nothing than to do wrong.’” (283) How many modern “thought leaders” have come to the same conclusion? Yeah, Catherine the Great beat you to it.\n\nThe King of Poland, Stanislaw Poniatowski, had an American secretary: Lewis Littlepage. Now I’m curious about him.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. If you’re at all interested in Catherine, you will want this book.\n\nBack to top\n\nChère Annette\n\nSubtitle: Letters from Russia 1820-1828 The Correspondence of the Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia to her daughter the Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna, the Princess of Orange\n\nEditor: S.W. Jackman\n\nPublisher: Alan Sutton\n\nYear: 1994\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI’ve had a copy of this book for years and re-read it recently because I was interested in Anna Pavlovna, one of Tsar Paul I’s daughters. She married the Prince of Orange, the future Willem II of the Netherlands. After her marriage in 1816, Anna and her mom, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia, kept up a steady stream of letters between Brussels (where Anna spent most of her time) and St. Petersburg. But what do those letters tell us about them?\n\nAlso: Every time I cite this book or Romanov Relations, I type Hugh Jackman as the editor. Every. Damn. Time.\n\nThis book covers the years 1820 to 1828, when Maria Feodorovna died. These were formative years for Anna, who married in 1816. Her new husband didn’t get along with his father, like, at all – neither one trusted the other. They saw each other’s character flaws too clearly, and both wanted to be the boss. In her daily letters, Maria Feodorovna gives Anna advice on how to smooth out the disagreements between the two men, techniques she’d learned during her long years of doing the same thing for disagreements between her husband, Grand Duke Paul, and his mother, Catherine the Great.\n\nWhat I liked most about this book was the mother/daughter relationship. Mom is calm and encouraging, giving her daughter the praise she needs to build her confidence. Mom also asks a lot of questions, including what the hell Anna was thinking when her palace caught fire and she left her diamonds inside it. The relationship appears incredibly open, with Anna telling her mom about her fears, expectations, and difficulties becoming the princess her mother expects her to be.\n\nYou won’t find groundbreaking history in this book – no revelations of never-before-seen palace intrigue, for example. But you will find a window into a touching relationship that reminds us historical figures were also just people, struggling with their jobs and relationships the same way we do. Nothing brings that fact home like reading correspondence.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. I love books with royal correspondence – it’s like you’re right there with the subjects as they live their lives. You hear about their frustrations, their impressions of court life and political events, and see what questions they ask each other. It’s frustrating when you don’t get all the answers, either because some letters were lost or not included in the collection. But I was incredibly moved by how much these letters revealed a caring mother-daughter relationship. In some of the quotes I pulled out below, you can really see Maria Feodorovna’s caring side. I tend to focus on her controlling side, because I’m usually thinking about if and how she behaved during major historical moments, like the assassination of Tsar Paul I or the Decembrist revolt. But in these quieter moments, in private notes to her youngest daughter, she’s incredibly encouraging.\n\nTidbits\n\nAs a Russian grand duchess, Anna Pavlovna received an annual payout from the Russian appanage fund. How much did she get? Over 100,000 guilders per year. (7)\n\nAnna’s favorite gemstone was topaz.\n\nOn July 17, 1820, Maria Feodorovna wrote to Anna: “When I was at Mont Pléasire I threw a stone into the sea for you. I picked up another and sent it to the shop to have it polished and the date engraved on it. I will send it to you as a paper weight.” Isn’t that the sweetest thing? (27)\n\nWhen Anna’s palace in Brussels burned down in late 1820, Maria Feodorovna hounded her for details. “Tell me, dear Annette, how did you manage to lose your diamonds?” she wrote on January 4, 1821. On January 8 she wrote, “So was it true that the only gems you lost were those you were wearing the previous day? What did you lose?” On January 11, she wrote, “Tell me if you have recovered the diamonds.” (36-7)\n\nMaria Feodorovna mentions Anna’s talent for drawing and painting several times. She encourages her to continue and not waste her talent. She even asks Anna to send her a new drawing for a drawing for a compilation album she’s putting together. Isn’t that sweet?\n\nMaria Feodorovna seemed very happy that her youngest daughter had a relatively happy marriage. She wrote, “He [Willem] makes you happy and heaven, in granting you such charming children, has blessed you both. Enjoy your good fortune, dear Annette, for as long as you live. That is my special prayer for you.” (Annette, 126)\n\nWhen Anna told her mom that she thought people were gossiping about her, her mom set her straight. “I can swear, my child, that I have never heard of any Russian who has travelled say that you are not loved in Brussels. On the contrary, I have heard how popular you are…Believe me, my dear, that criticism is not worth listening to even if it is being said, and I doubt that it is.” (132-3)\n\nMaria Feodorovna seemed so pleased when Anna was able to be her best self. She wrote, “I hear the same old Annette speaking as we used to in the good old days when she was still in the family home… what sweeter joy or consummation for a mother’s heart than to see you becoming more and more established in such noble ways of feeling and acting.” (146)\n\nThe year she died, Maria Feodorovna seemed so happy that Anna was working hard to control her temper and give more attention to her royal duties. She wrote, ““Persist in this noble course, in these elevated thoughts so worthy of you which assure a divine blessing and facilitate the way to solidarity. Just tell yourself that if I could love you any more I would now.” (155) Awww…that one hits me right in the feels.\n\nBack to top\n\nCity of Lights, City of Poison\n\nSubtitle: Murder, Magic, and the First Police Chief of Paris\n\nAuthor: Holly Tucker\n\nPublisher: W.W. Norton & Company\n\nYear: 2017\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI picked this up via a BookBub deal because it looked too good to resist. The Affair of the Poisons, as it’s known, shook the court of Louis XIV to its core. Murder, poison, and witchcraft: how can I not read this book?\n\nThis delightful nonfiction account of the Affair of the Poisons focuses on Nicolas de La Reynie, the first police chief of Paris. The case fell in his lap after he’d begun cleaning up the city, sweeping it clean literally and metaphorically. He was the one who first installed streetlights, thereby reducing crime at night.\n\nAs the book opens, we find out that decades later, after La Reynie’s death, he had left a key for Louis XIV – a key that opened a black leather box full of papers. These were his notes from his investigation of the strange murders that had occurred years ago. He had kept them secret until his death, as he’d promised Louis he would. Louis burned the papers.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the Affair of the Poisons had involved members of his court – in particular, his former mistress, Athénaïs, the Marquise de Montespan. As the story goes, Athénaïs had availed herself of love potions…and possibly more…in her attempt to keep the king’s interest. But the women who provided those potions were part of a shadowy network of Parisian fixers who provided abortions, poisons, and other illegal services. Need to bump off your husband? Get some poison. Need to collect from your father’s will sooner rather than later? Get some poison. Have a daughter in trouble? Get the right “medicines” and it won’t be a problem.\n\nBut too many suspicious murders tipped off the authorities that something bigger was going on. This launched La Reynie’s investigation and a case that obsessed all of Paris for years. As more and more noblewomen were arrested and even executed, it became clear that something awful was happening. Who would be next? Prominent letter writer Madame de Sévigné commented on how far-reaching and absorbing the case became, part of people’s daily lives. “The only thing one talks about here are the words, the actions, of La Brinvilliers…I pity you for not having me in Paris any longer so I can send you the latest on La Brinvilliers,” she wrote to her daughter, referencing one of the noblewomen under suspicion of murdering her relatives with poison. (93)\n\nI won’t spoil the story by telling you what happened. But hopefully this intrigues you enough to check it out…\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. It’s very entertaining and well-written. It reads like a novel, thanks to the direct quotes the author was able to source from direct police interviews, confessions, trials, and more. I really enjoyed this. The author does a great job of managing the storylines of multiple historical figures over the years. I never felt confused or overloaded with a data-dump of information.\n\nTidbits\n\nOn one common method of poisoning: “To help a client determined to get rid of her husband, Voisin asked for the man’s shirt. She would then bid adieu to her guest and pass the shirt to a trusted laundress, who washed it thoroughly with an arsenic-based soap. (In a pinch, the man’s shoes were also an option.) Buttoning his freshly pressed chemise, the husband unwittingly sealed his own fate. The rash appeared a few hours later, followed by blisters, nausea, vomiting, and finally death.” (33)\n\nDuring the construction of Versailles: “A massive army of laborers moved earth and lifted stones as big as buildings to make the king’s wishes come to fruition. Each day Louis inspected their work. During visits, he often stopped for a quick ride on the rustic wooden roller coaster—one of the first of its kind.” (58)\n\nLouis XIV’s finance minister, Colbert, was not fond of Versailles. He thought it was a waste of money and a missed opportunity to remain at the Louvre in Paris: “Fueling the conflict between domestic and military affairs, Colbert complained, ‘Your Majesty knows that, in addition to stunning successes on the battlefield, nothing marks more the grandeur and the spirit of princes than buildings. . . . Oh what a pity, that the greatest and most virtuous king would be measured by Versailles!’” (58)\n\nOn one common poison: “Bosse said she witnessed Voisin give diamond powder to the woman inside Notre-Dame Cathedral. Reputed to be one of the deadliest and most expensive forms of poison available, the sharp shards of diamond crystal entered the digestive system, where they supposedly made tiny deadly, yet imperceptible, perforations in the intestines.” (162)\n\nOn messing with the mind of a suspect who had fled France: “The prolific court gossip Primi Visconti also described Louvois’s actions toward [the Countess of] Soissons after her flight from France, claiming that Louvois arranged to have scores of black cats released outside a church in Brussels where Soissons was attending mass. Panicked by what they took as a sign of Soissons’s connection to the devil, the locals chased her from their city. The show had reportedly been arranged by spies from Louvois’s armies.” (190)\n\nBack to top\n\nClash of Generations\n\nSubtitle: A Habsburg Family Drama in the Nineteenth Century\n\nAuthor: Lavender Cassels\n\nPublisher: John Murray\n\nYear: 1973\n\nAvailable at: Archive.org\n\nI borrowed this book from Archive.org because it shows up frequently in the citations and bibliographies of other Habsburg books. It’s a good read, focused on the conflict between two older Habsburgs (Emperor Franz Josef and Archduke Albrecht) and two younger Habsburgs (Crown Prince Rudolf and Archduke Johann Salvator). The information on Rudolf wasn’t anything I hadn’t seen before, but I didn’t know anything about Johann Salvator.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nLong story short: The book compares and contrasts the older generation of Habsburgs with the younger generation in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. It starts with a section on Franz Josef and Albrecht, then covers Johann Salvator and Rudolf. The final third of the book covers the tragic demise of the younger Habsburgs. I won’t give any spoilers here, even though most of you probably know what happened to Rudolf.\n\nThere’s a lot here about inter-generational angst: the older generation doesn’t get it, says the younger generation, they’re ruining everything. And the older generation says, the younger generation is going to wreck everything – can’t they see how hard it is just to hold things together? You’ll get lots of detail about army politics and court politics. Although that may sound boring, Cassels makes it interesting because it’s always in the context of how Rudolf and Johann Salvator feel stifled by these politics.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYep. I really liked this one. It’s well-written, entertaining, and had original research (interesting quotations from Johann Salvator’s letters to his mother, the Grand Duchess of Tuscany). If you’re already very knowledgeable about the Habsburgs, there won’t be much new here for you. But Archdukes Albrecht and Johann Salvator aren’t as frequently covered as, say, Franz Josef, Sisi, and Rudolf, so it’s nice to see a larger family group discussed here than you may see in other sources. Most of the sources in the bibliography are in German, which gave me more to scope out for future research.\n\nTidbits\n\nArchduke Albrecht is almost always described as “the victor of Custozza” – the only battle the Austrians won during the war of 1866. However, his Chief of Staff, John, was the one who created the battle plan. When John died in 1876, Albrecht made sure he got John’s personal papers. The implication here is that those papers would have revealed how little Albrecht did, tarnishing his glory. (62, 69)\n\nNeither Rudolf nor Johann Salvator got along with Albrecht. Rudolf wrote to Franz Ferdinand in 1884: “He delights in nosing about, picking quarrels, in intriguing and doing harm…” (144)\n\nJohann Salvator provided the outline Rudolf used for his proposal for the 10-volume book series describing Austria-Hungary’s territories in words and pictures. I didn’t know that before.\n\nI’d seen the quote before describing the way Rudolf’s fiancé, Princess Stephanie of Belgium, walked down the aisle at their wedding: with “all the daintiness of a dragoon.” Turns out, that’s a quote from Archduke Wilhelm, Albrecht’s more-popular brother. (118)\n\nAt the family dinners Franz Josef served on January 1 and once a week throughout the winter, every archduke and archduchess in Vienna was expected to attend. The problem? He was served first and ate quickly. All the plates were removed as soon as he’d finished a course. So if you were a junior archduke at the foot of the table, you probably had zero chance to taste a course before it was cleared away. (53-4)\n\nJohann Salvator was involved in the search for a prince to rule Bulgaria (after Sandro of Battenberg abdicated). He was hoping to be named Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgarian army as a thank-you. It didn’t happen. Later, when he’d resigned his commission in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was both jobless and penniless, he went incognito to Sofia and asked Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria for an appointment as a lieutenant in the Bulgarian army. Ferdinand refused and told him to get out of Bulgaria at once. (240)\n\nI had no idea Johann Salvator’s long-term mistress, Milli Stubel, was on board the Saint Margaret with him on his final voyage. That’s all I’ll say here – the chapter title “Cape Horn” was a nail-biter for me.\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nDaughter of Prussia\n\nSubtitle: Louise, Grand Duchess of Baden and Her Family\n\nAuthor: John Van der Kiste\n\nPublisher: A&F\n\nYear: 2021\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this book because Louise is the mother-in-law of one of my long-term research subjects, Princess Hilda of Nassau (later Grand Duchess Hilda of Baden). I’m pretty used to Hilda barely appearing in books that touch on the people in her life, but hope springs eternal!\n\nIn the introduction, Van der Kiste tells us this is an expanded version of an article that originally appeared in Royalty Digest. It’s a slim book – of 134 total pages, 73 are the actual text of Louise’s story and the rest consists of illustrations, a timeline, family trees, footnotes, bibliography, index, and the list of illustrations. But I knew when I ordered it this it wasn’t going to be comprehensive – I just wanted to see what made the highlight reel of Louise’s life, which is exactly what this book provides.\n\nLouise was one of two children born to Prince Wilhelm of Prussia and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar. She married Frederick, the Prince Regent (later Grand Duke) of Baden. Later, her parents would reign as sovereigns of Prussia, and as of 1871, as Emperor and Empress of the new united Germany. The original title of the Royalty Digest article was “Louise, Grand Duchess of Baden: A model sovereign princess,” and that’s what she was. She did not interfere in politics; instead, she focused on charity work and supported her husband behind the scenes with a loving home environment. In Germany, that’s what made a “model” princess.\n\nLouise saw her family’s fortunes rise and fall. Her parents were the first rulers of unified Germany, but under her nephew William II, it all fell apart. In 1918, when Germany lost World War I, William abdicated and fled to the Netherlands. Louise’s son abdicated the throne of Baden, and the family lived out the rest of their lives as private citizens. Only her daughter, Victoria, remained relatively untouched as the Queen of Sweden, a neutral country. Louise died in 1923.\n\nCaveats\n\nNot many. In terms of production quality, there were a couple of mistakes/incorrect words. For example, the author refers to “Louise’s sister William” and Louise’s “brother” William when he means Louise’s brother-in-law, Prince William of Baden (21). The map included is captioned “Germany in the nineteenth century,” but it’s not; instead, it’s a recent map that includes the current German states and surrounding countries, including the Czech Republic (part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the nineteenth century). And one of the images included a watermark from the blog that had originally posted it. But none of that affects the information provided, so if you can focus on that, you’ll be fine.\n\nAlso, as the subtitle says, this is a book about Louise and her family. So rather than expecting detailed information about her, expect to see how she interacted with her parents, her daughter Victoria, and her nephew, Kaiser William II, for example. This book doesn’t claim to be a full-fledged biography of Louise, and it isn’t. Think of it as a summary, or as I mentioned above, a highlight reel.\n\nShould You Read This?\n\nIf you’re a fan of the Hohenzollerns, yes. Just be aware that you might not get much new information, depending on how much else you’ve read. Or, if you’re like me, you just want to have this as part of your collection because Van der Kiste is a reliably good author.\n\nTidbits\n\nLouise corresponded with Florence Nightingale and befriended Clara Barton, two of the nineteenth century’s most famous advocates for better nursing and care for soldiers.\n\nLouise might have been a gossip in her early years. Vicky, Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter, accuses Louise of repeating gossip about Princess Christian of Denmark’s flirtations with young officers.\n\nBismarck always suspected Louise of trying to influence her father politically. She tried once, on behalf of the oppressed Catholics of Alsace-Lorraine, but didn’t make a habit of it. Bismarck’s fear of her was based mostly on his fear of the potential influence of her mother, Empress Augusta, and sister-in-law, Crown Princess Victoria (Vicky).\n\nLouise was an excellent piano player and it was rumored that she could play Wagner’s entire ring cycle without sheet music. If true, wowza.\n\nLouise’s youngest son died at age 23 in 1888 of “inflammation of the lungs,” but it was rumored he actually died in a duel.\n\nThe tidbit I love most? For years, she organized and supervised the Easter egg hunt in the gardens at Bellevue Palace.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Diary of Frances, Lady Shelley\n\nAuthor: Frances, Lady Shelley\n\nPublisher: Charles Scribner’s Sons\n\nYear: 1912\n\nAvailable at: Google Books\n\nYou can read this for free via Google Books, and I’m so glad I did. I’d been looking for tidbits on the Orange family, and this book came up in search results. It’s a fascinating slice of life of a British aristocrat during the Napoleonic era. She traveled, she met important people, and she wrote it all down in a way that’s fun to read and still accessible to a modern reader.\n\nBorn in Lancashire in 1787, Frances was the daughter of Thomas Winckley of Preston and Jacintha Dalrymple, a cousin of the Earl of Peterborough. Her maternal aunt was Grace Dalrymple Eliot, who shared a prison cell with Madame du Barry during the French Revolution (long story).\n\nBy age 15, Frances had lost both her parents and went to live with her half-brother, Sir Thomas Hesketh. In 1805, she was presented to King George III at court. Two years later, she married the dashing Sir John Shelley, who was 15 years older than her. Their marriage was a happy one, although John had some notorious affairs prior to saying “I do” – including with Maria Fitzherbert’s sister. Among the couple’s friends? The future Duke of Wellington, which explains their entrée into Parisian society in the aftermath of Napoleon’s fall in 1814. After Waterloo, they went back to Paris and then made a European tour, visiting Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy, among other places. The bulk of the diary covers the years 1814-1816.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes! This was a delight to read. Lady Shelley’s flirtation with Wellington is fascinating – Wellington reads as the central male figure in this part of her story, far more so than her husband. In this volume of her diaries, you get her impressions of Tsar Alexander I, Grand Duchess Ekaterina Pavlovna, Prince Willem of Orange, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, Talleyrand, Metternich, and more. Frances wasn’t shy about including opinion in her diaries – and when she changed her mind about someone, she made notes later that indicated as such. A very fun read.\n\nTidbits\n\nOn Britain’s Princess Charlotte: “Her manner in public is extremely forward.” (47) and “Princess Charlotte’s manners are as bad and hoydenish as possible. She is very clever, and wilful.” (55)\n\nOn Tsar Alexander I and his sister: “If I have been led away by the popular cry in favour of the Emperor of Russia, let me now retract my opinion. Each succeeding day dispersed the halo of glory with which fancy had exalted the magnanimous Alexander...Personally, he is as brave as a lion, but entirely under petticoat government. His sister, the Grand Duchess, has complete power over him; and, shocking as the notion is to English morals, is generally regarded as his evil genius.” (62)\n\nOn Talleyrand: ”I never saw so diabolical a countenance as Talleyrand's. He has no very marked feature, is pale, has a crafty expression, and a most villainous mouth. His fiendish laugh still haunts me.” (121)\n\nOn approaching the Papal Territories in central Italy: “At last we came to the Tiber, having passed, every half mile or so along the road, the leg or arm of a man nailed to a post, as a warning to malefactors. Twas thus the Pope had done justice to some of the assassins who infested the roads.” (349)\n\nOn Marie Louise, Napoleon’s second wife: “Marie Louise, though not regularly handsome, has an animated and expressive countenance, and her figure is fine and commanding. She looked at that moment every inch the Empress, and when I reflected upon her fallen state - a mother deprived of the child whom she adores - I felt for her the deepest sympathy…I cannot help thinking that General Niepperg, who accompanied her on that romantic tour [of Switzerland], had more to do with it than the climate. She seems to be deeply attached to him, and Shelley thinks…” (383-4) Her sentence actually does trail off like this. It’s obvious what Shelley thought, and he was right.\n\nBack to top\n\nDivine Lola\n\nSubtitle: A True Story of Scandal and Celebrity\n\nAuthor: Cristina Morató\n\nTranslator: Andrea Rosenberg\n\nPublisher: Amazon Crossing\n\nYear: 2021\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nThis eBook showed up in an Amazon promotional email in 2021 – and I’m just now getting to it. I’ve never had a particular interest in Lola herself, but I knew she had a disastrous relationship with King Ludwig I of Bavaria. And after reading Die Herzen der Leuchtenberg, where you get a front-row seat to the debacle via Ludwig’s sister, Augusta, I figured I’d take a quick look.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nLola Montez was born In Ireland in 1821 as Eliza Gilbert. Determined to escape her circumstances first as the stepdaughter and then the wife of British army officers stationed in India, she ran away and rebranded herself as an impoverished Spanish aristocrat. Back in Europe, as “Lola Montez,” she took a one-woman dance show on the road in 1843, eventually performing in London, Paris, Berlin, and Munich.\n\nFamous more for her beauty and violent temper than her dancing skills, in 1846, she entranced the aging King Ludwig I of Bavaria in a May-December friendship that turned into a passionate romance. He showered her with love, poetry, jewels, and all the accoutrements of a royal mistress. According to this book, they slept together at least once, but it’s unclear if that was a one-off or a regular occurrence. Mostly he was jealous of the younger, more attractive university students Lola hung out with.\n\nNow, the Bavarian government officials and public hated Lola. Like, with a vengeance. They believed she was trying to run the country through Ludwig, encouraging him to ditch all his conservative ministers and policies. This book actually downplays any political influence she had – it mostly focuses on her personal relationship with Ludwig, and her never-ending quest for money and a title. Does that mean she didn’t have much political influence? Or just that this book didn’t really focus on it? This is the only Lola book I’ve ever read, so I can’t tell you. But between the hatred for Lola, the hatred for Ludwig’s reforms, and the revolutionary spirit of 1848, the people forced Ludwig off the throne and Lola out of the country.\n\nAfter fleeing Bavaria, she took her show on the road in North America, settling in Grass Valley, California for a few years before moving on to Australia and then back to New York. She started a new life on the lecture circuit, and was reinventing herself as a public speaker and a renewed Christian, when she died in 1861.\n\nAlong the way, she had married a few more times…I lost track of how many bigamous marriages she made – two? Three? As much as I wanted to sympathize with a woman who refused to be told what to do or how to live, Lola’s violent temper (she hits people…a lot), narcissism, and continual bad decisions made that hard to do.\n\nCaveats\n\nOne thing that REALLY irritated me about this book was the occasional bit of poorly developed made-up dialogue. It made the book feel like a young adult novel rather than factual non-fiction. In the author’s note, she says she did this to make the book more entertaining, but Lola’s life is already pretty entertaining. It’s like being given a slab of the highest quality Kobe beef in the world (Lola’s jam-packed life story) and after the cooking (writing) process, dousing your final product with dollar-store ketchup to make sure it has enough flavor.\n\nIn several snatches of that made-up dialogue, Lola rails against Victorian morals and morality. This made me stop and think. Would anyone in the late 1850s have referred to society’s current morals as “Victorian”? Victoria had been on the throne since 1837, but my understanding is that “Victorian” is an adjective only used later when looking back to describe the history and culture throughout Victoria’s reign. I could be wrong, but the fact that this made-up dialogue took me so far out of the book as to question its correctness ticked me off.\n\nI didn’t get a clear sense from this book how much political influence Lola actually had in Bavaria. She later referred to herself as the “shadow queen” of Bavaria, but the book focuses more on the personal side of her time with Ludwig. He was nuts about her, writing her letters and poetry and getting jealous when he heard she was hanging out with younger, more attractive men. She pestered him for money and for a title, believing that this title would somehow magically win her respect. Ludwig had to defend her constantly against, well, everyone else in his life, but even he knew the title wasn’t going magically bring her acceptance. And although I’m glad the author covered this aspect of their relationship in detail, it was to the exclusion of any actual influence she might have had. So I came away from the Bavarian section of the book a little unclear on how much she may have merited the hatred of the Bavarian people in terms of government meddling.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nI’d recommend skipping this one, mostly due to the made-up dialogue. There are plenty of other books on Lola listed in the bibliography, so you’re not going to be short of options in Spanish, German, French, or English. If you have Kindle Unlimited, however, it’s free to read – so there’s your best option.\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Eagles Die\n\nSubtitle: Franz Joseph, Elisabeth, and Their Austria\n\nAuthor: George R. Marek\n\nPublisher: Harper & Row\n\nYear: 1974\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI ordered a used copy of this book because I saw it in the bibliographies of a couple other books (a familiar story, by this point). The author was born and educated in Vienna, so I figured he might have some useful contacts or memories that might add something to his telling of the Franz Joseph/Elisabeth story. One Austrian count he spoke to, upon being asked an undisclosed question, “I don’t know, and if I did I wouldn’t tell you. Such things don’t belong in a biography.” (xv) I hoped Marek would pursue such questions and give us the answers.\n\nGeorge Marek was a Vice-President and General Manager of the RCA Record Division, so this book pays special attention to music as a leitmotif. If you’ve read any of Frederic Morton’s books (A Nervous Splendor, Thunder at Twilight), you’re familiar with the way blending information from other disciplines into a historical tale can enrich it immensely. This book achieves something of a similar effect, with digressions into how composers like Johannes Brahms and Anton Bruckner lived and worked in Franz Joseph’s Vienna.\n\nMarek provides a poetic description of Franz Joseph in his foreword as “a sovereign of little malice and intermittent kindliness, [who] was forced by his tradition and the bent of his mind to act in so retrograde a manner that one can say that he hastened the sinking of the sun. During his reign and empire slid into the dusk, and he could not understand the reason for its fading.” (xiii)\n\nThe book starts off with a chapter on the Viennese: how accurate are descriptions of them as music-loving, cheerful, happy-go-lucky people. Marek argues for a deeper strain of melancholy native to the Viennese, which is similar to what Morton argues in A Nervous Splendor.\n\nFrom that point on, we get the well-known story of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth. Glancing through the pages here, I see I didn’t underline anything, so I must not have learned anything new and shocking. But I enjoyed Marek’s telling and the way he brought elements of his own memories of Vienna, composers, and other influences into a story that could have been myopically focused on the people themselves.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf your library has a copy or you can shell out a few bucks for a used copy like me, yes. It’s a fresh perspective, with more attention paid to the general setting (Vienna, Austria) than many other biographers provide.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Fortress\n\nSubtitle: The Siege of Przemyśl and the Making of Europe’s Bloodlands\n\nAuthor: Alexander Watson\n\nPublisher: Basic Books\n\nYear: 2020\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought a used copy of this book to get a better feel for the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s capabilities (or lack thereof) in World War I. The father of my Austrian archduchesses, Friedrich, was the nominal commander-in-chief, so I’m always on the lookout for tidbits about him and the family.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nThis book is about the struggle for control of the city and fortress of Przemyśl in 1914-1915. Located near the border between present-day Poland and Ukraine, the city was home to permanent residents and garrison members who were a multi-lingual, multi-ethnic cross-sample of the Austro-Hungarian Empire: German Austrians, Hungarians, Jews, Croatians, Hungarians, Ukrainian-speaking Ruthenians, and more. Their struggle with the invading and besieging Russian army is fascinating. Without spoiling things, there was an initial battle, a siege, a takeover, and another takeover. Both sides committed atrocities based on racial lines, which is what most reviewers commented on as new information to them.\n\nWatson did an absolutely amazing job of finding primary source material that highlighted more than the commanders – the pilots, the regular people, the nurses, the sex workers, the rank and file, and more. One thing I really enjoyed was the female perspective that cropped up in Watson’s chosen source material. Normally, in my head, I think of war books as “boy books” because there are almost never women in them. Watson solved that problem by choosing a good number of primary sources by or referring to women. Countess Ilka Künigl-Ehrenburg, Helena z Seifertów Jabłońska, Wanda Zakrewska, and Eva Anna Welles all produced primary sources Watson consulted. Can I just say how refreshing this is?\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nMaybe – it depends whether you fall asleep when reading about battles or battle strategy. There’s plenty of human detail in this book – and, surprisingly, female perspectives – but if military history leaves you cold, even Countess Ilka’s diary entries might not save it for you. And there aren’t nearly enough maps, so after awhile, I just kind of gave up on actually understanding the movements described and just tried to go with the flow of the story.\n\nBut if you’re interested in why in holy hell Austria-Hungary performed so poorly in the war, this book will give you a very detailed snapshot that explains everything.\n\nTidbits\n\nAustria-Hungary’s chief strategist, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, had competing priorities. He should have had extra motivation not to suck because he was super afraid that the embarrassment and shame of losing the fortress would also lose the love of his married girlfriend, Gina. He wrote, “If I fail, then I shall also lose this woman; an appalling thought for me, for then I would have to withdraw into solitariness for the rest of my life.” (49)\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian supply chain was…shitty. This resulted in the entire garrison receiving only 4,300 cloaks and 6,000 “calf-skin rucksacks” prior to the siege. What the hell were the men meant to do with rucksacks? Well, a division of Hungarian infantry figured out how to turn them into vests. That detail made me smile. (153)\n\nThe first ever air strike against a civilian urban population? Yep, that happened in Przemyśl in December of 1914. Russians dropped 275 bombs on the city and its surrounding area. (155)\n\nConrad launched an offensive to try and relieve the fortress on January 23, 1915. He sent 175,000 soldiers up and over the Carpathian Mountains – some as high as 2,600 feet. It was a freaking disaster. The Third Army lost 2/3 of its men in two weeks, half through frostbite or illness. One man who survived later said, “Religious souls visualize hell as a blazing inferno with burning embers and intense heat. The soldiers fighting in the Carpathian Mountains during that first winter of the war know otherwise.” (192)\n\nThe original drop-dead date for running out of food during the siege was February 18. But by getting creative, the Austrian military lengthened that about a month longer. They cut rations, slaughtered and ate horses, and diluted flour with turnip, bran, or 20% birch wood. (*gulp*) (207)\n\nWhen the Russians took over the fortress after the Austrian surrender, they expelled all the Jewish residents. It was the “largest single forced removal of a community perpetrated by the Russian military on occupied soil.” Later, Austrian authorities estimated that 17,000 Jews were forced out of the town, fortress, and surrounding area.

Those children include Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna, mother of past research subject Princess Alexandra of Hanover (later Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin). Anastasia’s niece, Zia, married into the Wernher family, so I wanted to see how much information this book had about her and her Romanov family.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nLong story short: This book covers two generations of Wernhers: Julius, the father, who was instrumental in developing gold and diamond mines in South Africa, and Harold, the son, who married Zia, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich’s daughter. Julius became incredibly wealthy, catapulting his wife and three sons into the British social hierarchy. His good works, philanthropy, and incredible business sense helped him earn the respect of his peers – although because most of his business partners were Jewish, he was assumed to be Jewish as well (he wasn’t). As with any stratospheric social or financial rise, the family wasn’t without its detractors, who nitpicked Julius’s wife for her extravagant fashions. Of Julius’s three sons, the youngest died in World War I, the oldest frittered away all his money, and the second (Harold) became his heir, inheriting the palatial estate of Luton Hoo.\n\nHarold married Zia Torby, daughter of Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich. It didn’t seem to be a love match on her part, although Harold would later write that he’d been in love with Zia since age 15. After the Russian Revolution, Zia’s parents were strapped for cash and there was family friend Harold, incredibly rich. Zia had other suitors, including the future King George II of Greece, but her family refused to consider that marriage. After Zia and Harold married, he did indeed have to support her family periodically. The couple’s relationship had its ups and downs, but they remained firmly committed to each other, their kids, and the life they built together. Some of the most amusing anecdotes in the whole book are of Zia as an old woman, imperious to the last, demanding her daughter go make Queen Elizabeth II hurry when she was late for dinner.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes, if you’re interested in any of the following: the history of South Africa, the diamond business, late Victorian industry, British horse racing, or Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, his wife, Sophie Countess of Torby, and their descendants. There’s also a fair amount about Harold Wernher’s contribution to D-Day and the floating harbor project. As you can see, the book covers a surprisingly diverse amount of subjects. And you won’t find a ton of gossip here – scandals are hinted at rather than explored in detail, with the exception of Derrick Wernher’s gambling/debt problems.\n\nTidbits\n\nIn 1898, Julius was named one of the Life-Governors of De Beers. Yeah, that De Beers. (116)\n\nThe author does get one thing wrong – he says Grand Duke Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin jumped out a window in Cannes to kill himself. Nope. It wasn’t a window, and it was never confirmed that he died by suicide. (205)\n\nWhen Julius Wernher died in 1912, his widow kept the letters of condolence from Princess Helena and Princess Louise (Queen Victoria’s daughters). Louise had sent Julius cornflowers while he was sick so they would remind him of where he grew up in Germany. Isn’t that sweet? (247)\n\nCountess Torby sold Queen Mary a diamond and sapphire necklace, which Mary later gave to her daughter (the Princess Royal) as a wedding present. It was believed to have belonged to Empress Elisabeth (although the author doesn’t specify which one – presumably Alexander I’s wife and not Peter the Great’s daughter). (282)\n\nAccording to Harold, it was his sister-in-law, Nada, who encouraged Princess Marina to marry Prince George (later Duke of Kent). (338)\n\nWhen Julius’s wife, then Lady Ludlow, died, she left Queen Mary several things from her vast collection of British porcelain. Mary returned the peacock and peahen to Harold, saying she was superstitious about them and hoped he wouldn’t be offended. (399)\n\nGrand Duke Michael had a number of eccentricities. He couldn’t stand the sound of rustling paper, and neither could Zia. She forbid the wrapping of Christmas presents and instead, called the family to her bedside on Christmas morning. Their presents were buried in the folds of her bedding.

If you liked Downton Abbey, the stories in this book will interest you (and remind you of Cora and her mother).\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nThis book is about the late 19th century trend of rich American women marrying titled British men. In many cases, the men were in need of a cash infusion to save their ancestral estates. The so-called American “Dollar Princesses” had the cash they needed, and – often – mothers who were anxious to see their daughters get a title in return. As this book shows, the mothers often needed their daughters’ social success to create or boost their own.\n\nUnfortunately, in most cases, these marriages were unhappy.\n\nAmerican society and British society functioned differently in terms of the expected role of women. In American society, women ran things while the men worked. In British society, the men ran politics, the government, and society at large while the women ran their husband’s house and not much else. American girls who’d grown up seeing their mothers in positions of social power and experiencing power themselves (over doting fathers and lovestruck suitors) found themselves with less freedom and power. No longer the belle of the ball or a cosseted daughter, these women often struggled to replicate the free and easy lifestyle they’d had in America.\n\nSome of the people covered are:\n\nAlva Vanderbilt Belmont & Consuelo Vanderbilt, future Duchess of Marlborough\n\nConsuelo Yznaga, future Duchess of Manchester and Devonshire\n\nThe three Jerome sisters (but especially Jennie, future Lady Randolph Churchill)\n\nMay Goelet, future Duchess of Roxburgh\n\nAdèle Beach Grant, future Countess of Essex\n\nAnna Gould, future Countess de Castellane\n\nThe “marrying Wilsons”: Grace, May, Belle, and Richard\n\nCornelia Bradley-Martin, future Countess of Craven\n\nMinnie Stevens, future Lady Paget\n\nVirginia Bonynge, future Viscountess Deerhurst\n\nMaud Burke, the future Lady “Emerald” Cunard\n\nTennessee Claflin, the future Viscountess of Monserrate\n\nCaveat\n\nIn terms of organization, this book felt a little disjointed. I suspect it’s made up of chapters written at separate times for separate purposes cobbled together into a book. At times, information is repeated, which is what made me think some chapters might have been written as stand-alone articles intended for other publications. People are mentioned, dropped, then discussed again 50 or 75 pages later. Some people are only mentioned in the chapter devoted to them, such as Virginia Bonynge. Some chapters cover what it was like to live in the Gilded Age; others cover individual stories or themes. In general, the book follows a chronological timeline, but there’s lots of jumping around between people’s stories and general information about the period.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you can get it from your library or buy the Kindle version ($3.99, as of this writing), yes. There are some great stories in here, like the chapter on Virginia Bonynge. I wish there were an entire book about Virginia’s family story – it’s worth the price of this book alone.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Illustrious Dead\n\nSubtitle: The Terrifying Story of How Typhus Killed Napoleon’s Greatest Army\n\nAuthor: Stephan Talty\n\nPublisher: Crown Publishers\n\nYear: 2009\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this book because it sounded fascinating – it doesn’t really dovetail with anyone I’m researching, but I couldn’t resist that subtitle.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nThis book tells a very scary story: how typhus resurfaced during Napoleon’s march into Russia, decimated his army, and contributed greatly to the failure of his campaign there. Typhus had been around for centuries, if not millennia, but was little understood. It cropped up when armies marched across countries and continents. It had appeared in the 15th century, when Ferdinand and Isabella fought to force the Moors out of Spain. And it had cropped up again in the 16th, when Francis I of France had tried to conquer Italy.\n\nThe disease produced similar symptoms in its victims: lethargy, fatigue, fever, and spots on the torso and legs (but not the face and hands). It not only affected soldiers on the move, but people in the countryside around them – the people who fed them, housed them, and nursed them. But germ theory was not common knowledge, so people believed this disease was spread by bad smells in the air, or just the air in general.\n\nThey didn’t know it was the common louse, jumping from victim to victim.\n\nAll they knew was that the disease was killing incredible numbers of the men of Napoleon’s Grande Armée. Of course, disease wasn’t the only thing killing them. Cold, hunger, thirst, and starvation took their tool, too. But this book’s argument is that typhus left those other factors in the dust.\n\nHere are a few stats Talty provides on page 252:\n\nBetween 550,000 and 600,000 French soldiers crossed the Niemen onto Russian territory.\n\nAbout 100,000 were captured.\n\nTotal dead are estimated between 400,000 – 540,000, depending on the source.\n\nLess than 25% of those died fighting.\n\nOf course, it’s not possible to show how many men died specifically from typhus, as opposed to hypothermia or starvation. But those numbers alone show how devastating this campaign was, and how important it is to take every factor into consideration when talking about why it failed.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes – I found this book fascinating and easy to read. It doesn’t have the detail of, say, Dominic Lieven’s book on the Russian campaign, but that’s not what its purpose is. You have to understand how the campaign unfolded to see how the disease took hold, so there’s enough information to understand how, where, and why the army moved where it did. Plus, it’s written for a general audience, so you don’t need to know anything about germ theory or Napoleonic warfare to enjoy the story.\n\nBack to top\n\nJe devais être impératrice\n\nSubtitle: Mémoires de la dernière princesse héritière d'Autriche-Hongrie\n\nAuthor: Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, Countess of Lonyay\n\nPublisher: Editions Frédérique Patat\n\nYear: 2019\n\nAvailable at: Google Play Books\n\nThe first time I looked this book up online (circa 2018), there were only very expensive used copies in English available for purchase ($75+). As of this writing in early 2023, there are 2 used copies on AbeBooks – for $190+. Nope – not happening. So when, in 2020, I found this version in French on Google Play Books for under $5, I jumped. I can read French well enough to get the gist of things, and use a translator to help with tricky spots. Apparently, in 2021, someone added an English-language version you can read for free on Archive.org. The trick? The text isn’t quite the same as the French edition I read via eBook. I’m still parsing what’s different about the two, but if you’re obsessed like me, you don’t want to miss a damn word. Now you know – and knowing is half the battle.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nBorn in 1864, Princess Stéphanie of Belgium was married to Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria-Hungary when she was barely sixteen. If you follow my book-reading odyssey, you’ll be familiar with her father, King Leopold II of the Belgians (portrayed in King Leopold’s Ghost). Stéphanie describes her childhood as cold. She longed for affection and praise and almost never got it from either parent. Her mother, she explains, walled off her emotions after her only son died young. Her two daughters, Stéphanie and Louise, found affection and companionship in each other and household staff members.\n\nStéphanie’s marriage was an arranged one. Her father thought it would be good to have a tie with Austria-Hungary, and that was that. The marriage started out relatively well, but quickly turned sour because Rudolf and Stéphanie had little in common. That’s not surprising – what would a sheltered teenage girl have in common with a worldly, already disillusioned man in his twenties? The couple had one child together, a daughter – not the son and heir the empire desired. But there would not be another child because Rudolf infected Stéphanie with venereal disease, destroying her ability to have another child.\n\nAlthough they remained married, they were not happy. Rudolf hunted, slept with his mistresses, inspected army regiments, and wrote editorials for the Neue Wiener Tageblatt. Stéphanie was left behind to keep up appearances at court, often filling in for the absent and uninterested Empress Elisabeth.\n\nThen, in 1889, Rudolf died by suicide at his hunting lodge of Mayerling – after shooting his teenage mistress, Mary Vetsera, in a murder-suicide pact. Stéphanie was one of the only people who had tried to help Rudolf by bringing his deteriorating mental and physical condition to her in-laws’ attention. They did nothing.\n\nThis book only covers Stéphanie’s life through Rudolf’s death. Later in life, she married Count Elmer Lonyay, a Hungarian noble. You won’t meet him anywhere in these pages, however. The book ends with a lovely condolence letter written to Stéphanie by Queen Elisabeth of Romania (Carmen Sylva).\n\nStéphanie usually gets a bad rap – she’s described as haughty, ambitious, silly, and unintelligent. And yes, parts of this book are extremely flattering to her, and any modern reader is instantly going to see some self-aggrandizing going on here. But at the same time, there’s more to Stéphanie than most people gave her credit for. She was devoted to her duty as the future empress – which is more than could ever be said for her mother-in-law, the actual empress. She was the only person who really tried to save Rudolf. She writes about the coldness and deprivations of her childhood and her deep need for love and affection. That kind of need, that longing, can really mess a kid up. Not to mention being married so young. I’m prepared to give her quite a bit of slack for the so-called crimes of ambition and imperial haughtiness. She was finding worth and validation through her position – which she was forced into by her parents. In my mind, she was trying to make the best of a situation she didn’t ask for.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you’re interested in the Habsburgs and read French, yes.\n\nIn my opinion, Stéphanie doesn’t always see herself clearly. Everywhere she goes, she wants you to know that she won all hearts, that people were crazy about her, that she was universally admired and beloved. Maybe – but something rang a little false about these statements, so I took her descriptions of raving crowds and faithful peasants with a grain of salt. At one point, she admits that her “natural gift for winning hearts” came from her mother “and I had no merit in it.” (Ch. 5)\n\nBut even if her descriptions of herself can’t quite be trusted, she says some insightful things about other people.\n\nShe mentions several other women accused of being ambitious – her aunt Charlotte (Empress of Mexico) and her aunt Victoria (Crown Princess of Prussia). She couches Charlotte’s ambition as a product of vast intelligence and willingness to do good in the world. Of Victoria, she says: “Already, at that time, she was the target of violent attacks. She was said to be ambitious, proud and intriguing. They forgot to say that when a princess marries a crown prince, her desire, obviously, is to become empress or queen; and then is not this ambition entirely justified? … Like all intelligent women of quality who were forbidden to use their abilities, she suffered from her inactivity.” (Ch. 3)\n\nI kind of love that Stéphanie brings this up – as children, these girls are given to heirs to a throne, and then punished when they like (or convince themselves they like) the perks of the job. As if they were ever given a choice….\n\nTidbits\n\nAll 3 kids had small gardens at Laeken. After their brother died, Louise and Stéphanie took care of his garden for him. They arranged flower beds, dug, sowed, planted, weeded, and grafted. I love the idea of two sisters keeping their dead brother’s garden alive. Later, after Louise married, Stephanie took care of her garden until her younger sister, Clémentine, was old enough to take it over. (Ch. 1)\n\nShe owned a painting done by her aunt, Charlotte (Empress Carlota of Mexico). (Ch. 1)\n\nAccording to Stéphanie, at age 15, her parents called her to them and her father said, “The Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary has come here to ask for your hand. Your mother and I are all in favor of this marriage. We have chosen you to be Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary. Go away, think about it and give us your answer tomorrow.” That night, when she went to talk to her mom and express her doubts, her mom talked her into it. Stephanie bought into the vision of herself as a sovereign, there to ensure the well-being of her mother’s people. But the doubts about marrying a man she didn’t know lingered. “I could not have known that already at that time I had been duped. It was only later, much later, that I was told that my future husband had not come to Brussels alone, that his friend, a certain Dame F., had accompanied him.” And by “friend,” she means a friend with benefits. (Ch. 2)\n\nStéphanie’s wedding gift from the city of Budapest? “…necklace, earrings, belt, chain and barrettes, a gift from the city of Budapest. All of these jewels represented a kilo and a half of gold, in addition to 32 large brilliants, a thousand smaller brilliants, three hundred opals and four magnificent rubies.” Dayum. (Ch. 3)\n\nOf former Empress Maria Anna, widow of Emperor Ferdinand, Stéphanie says: “Despite fifty years of residence in Austria, she had not learned German; we had to speak French or Italian to her.” (Ch. 3)\n\nStéphanie was a late bloomer. In the first year of marriage, she describes being tired from what sound like growth spurts. Then, when she had her baby Elisabeth in 1883, she says that when she got up from childbed, “I was surprised to find that my dresses were too short. I had grown suddenly and was even slightly taller than the Crown Prince.” (Ch. 3)\n\nBack to top\n\nJuly 1914\n\nSubtitle: Countdown to War\n\nAuthor: Sean McMeekin\n\nPublisher: Basic Books\n\nYear: 2014\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nThis book is an in-depth look at how World War I began. I’ve read a few books by now on the start of the war, but I was interested in this one because the author has a specific argument about who’s to blame. If you had to assign blame, who would you choose? Now click open the box below and see if you agree with McMeekin.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nMcMeekin’s thesis is that Russia and France should carry more of the blame for starting the war than traditionally assigned. You usually see blame assigned to Germany and Austria-Hungary, not members of the Triple Entente. McMeekin presents Russia and France as led by politicians who willingly withheld information from their allies to make the situation look worse than it was. The Germans and Austro-Hungarians, by contrast, are largely presented as bumblers, at cross purposes with each other despite being allies.\n\nThis book highlights how dysfunctional the Austrian government really was. When Foreign Minister Berchtold and General Conrad were eager for war, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Count Tisza, held them back. Not because of humanitarian concerns, but because war wasn’t good for his home country of Hungary. Now, in most cases, holding someone back from starting a war is a good thing. But in this case, a quick war against Serbia – begun before the Russians could mobilize, and with the full support of Germany – might have been the best way out of a global conflict. But because of the power Franz Josef had had to give to Hungary as a member of the Dual Monarchy, there was nothing he could do when Tisza cock-blocked the idea of a short, fast war against Serbia. Tisza’s attempt to safeguard Hungarian interests at the expense of Austria’s comes off as one of the key moves that made a larger, deadlier conflict inevitable.\n\nSo how does McMeekin attempt to prove the Russians and French had a hand in engineering the war? Well, for starters, Russian Foreign Minister Sazonov straight-up told the French ambassador they were doing so. As McMeekin notes, on July 24: “In less than three hours , Russia’s foreign minister had (1) instructed Serbia’s minister not to comply with Austria’s ultimatum and promised that ‘Serbia may count on Russian aid’ (although it is unclear whether he also spelled out what form this ‘aid’ would take); (2) warned Germany’s ambassador that Russia would go to war with Austria if she ‘swallowed up’ Serbia; and (3) informed France’s ambassador about Russia’s impending mobilization measures.” (190)\n\nThe fact that France knew about Russia’s mobilization and hid it from the British (and did nothing to stop it) brings them in for some measure of blame. They knew Russia was mobilizing and let it happen. As McMeekin notes: “Addressing journalists at the Chamber of Deputies, Jaurès was seen to ‘explode’ in anger over Russia’s malign influence on French foreign policy: ‘Are we going to unleash a world war because Izvolsky is still furious over Aehrenthal’s deception in the Bosnian affair [of 1908–1909]?’” (322) The answer, apparently, was yes.\n\nI won’t go into more detail here – no spoilers. But it was definitely interesting to read McMeekin’s arguments. I’m not sure I agree with them, but they’ve given me more to think about.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you’re interested in WWI, yes.\n\nIf you’d rather stick with royal women, this is probably too wide a scope for you to enjoy. Franz Josef, Wilhelm II, and Nicholas II are all prime movers in this story, but women are few and far between.\n\nTidbits\n\nFranz Ferdinand had a psychic moment. As Franz Ferdinand travelled to Sarajevo in June of 1914, the wiring in his train car was on the fritz. Candlelight was the only available light, and Franz Ferdinand’s reply was prescient: he said traveling in that train car was like traveling “in a tomb.” (5)\n\nThe British ambassador to Vienna dropped the ball. Not everyone in the Austro-Hungarian government wanted war. While the Austro-Hungarians were still trying to get their shit together in mid-July, retired Austrian ambassador Heinrich Lützow left Vienna for his country estate. His neighbor just happened to be the British Ambassador to Vienna, Sir Maurice de Bunsen. On July 15, Lützow actually told de Bunsen what Austria was up to, what with the ultimatum to Serbia being intentionally designed to provoke a belligerent response. “As far as we can glean from Lützow’s memoirs , his own intention was to frustrate Berchtold’s designs by warning the British about what was brewing , in the hope that they might act to restrain Serbia , France , and Russia.” And what did de Bunsen do with this information? Nothing. He did not forward this information to London. SMH. See something, say something, dude. (128)\n\nFrench president Raymond Poincaré was not super-impressed by Tsar Nicholas II’s palace at Peterhof when he came for a visit in late July (20-23). “Poincaré was less than impressed by the park, which he found ‘a rather fadé replica of Versailles.’ His ‘heavily gilt,’ white satin–lined suite, too, he found overdone, ‘being somewhat of a piece with the over-decorated galleries and the great saloons, the gorgeousness of which seems rather to run riot.’” (149)\n\nGrand Duchess Anastasia, wife of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, may have let too much slip to the French ambassador. During Poincaré’s visit, she told France’s ambassador to Russia, Maurice Paléologue, exactly what was up. “When the champagne started flowing, the mood grew more euphoric still. Grand Duchess Anastasia, as if taking Paléologue into confidence, told France’s ambassador that ‘there’s going to be war. There’ll be nothing left of Austria. You’re going to get back Alsace and Lorraine. Our armies will meet in Berlin. Germany will be destroyed!’ She may have been just warming up, but a ‘stern gaze’ from Tsar Nicholas II cut off this belligerent reverie. Anastasia was, after all, married to the host, a possible commander in chief of the Russian armies.” (163)\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II only read Austria’s ultimatum to Serbia in the newspaper. The Austrians had not sent it to Germany ahead of time, despite relying on Germany’s “blank check” in terms of support for a war against Serbia. As McMeekin notes: “What angered Wilhelm most was that he had finally learned that day [Monday, July 27]of the text of Austria’s Thursday ultimatum to Belgrade — not from Jagow or Bethmann, but from the Wolff news agency.” (225)\n\nBerchtold lied to Franz Josef to get him to approve the declaration of war on Serbia. On the morning of Tuesday, July 28, Berchtold went to the emperor at Bad Ischl and persuaded him to declare war. How? By telling him that Serbian troops had already fired on Austrians on the Danube. They had not. (244)\n\nWhen Austria finally declared war on Serbia on July 28, Serbian officials thought it was a joke. The telegram declaring war came through at 11:10 am on Tuesday morning, July 28. The Serbians deciphered it at 12:30 pm. “…Berchtold’s telegram was unaccompanied by any military action, which appears to have left the Serbians in doubt as to its veracity. Pašić, indeed, thought it was a hoax, not least because the direct telegraphic line to Austria had been cut off and he was not sure how the telegram had reached Serbian territory. Serbia’s prime minister went so far as to wire to Petersburg, Paris, and London to inform friendly powers ‘of the strange telegram he had received and to ask whether it was true that Austria had declared war on Serbia.’” (245) A fiction writer couldn’t make this stuff up.\n\nBack to top\n\nKatharina Pawlowna\n\nAuthor: Detlef Jena\n\nPublisher: Verlag Friedrich Pustet\n\nYear: 2003\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this book because I’m interested in all the daughters of Tsar Paul I and Tsarina Maria Feodorovna...but I also had an ulterior motive. I’m researching Anna Pavlovna, and I’ve seen references to the less-than-stellar relationship she had with big sister Ekaterina Pavlovna (or Katharina Pawlowna as she’s known in German, like in this book’s title…for the sake of consistency, I’ll use the German version of her name in the rest of this review). Could this book confirm that they didn’t get along? And if, so offer any reasons why? Let’s find out.\n\nFirst things first. This book is in German, which means I had to scan it and translate it digitally, which results in a less than optimal reading experience. Some books translate really well using digital translators, while others – like this one – do not. I used Amazon Translate for a first pass, which gets you an 80% readable copy.\n\nThen you have to take individual sentences that don’t make sense and try a different digital translator, like Google Translate or DeepL. Doing that, you can get to a 95% readable copy.\n\nThere are always some sentences that just don’t translate well at all, leaving me to muddle through the construction of the sentence using what I remember from four years of high school French (not really applicable) and one quarter of college linguistics (actually helpful). Whenever I use this method for a non-English book, there’s no way I can comment on the style because I’m not absorbing it as intended. Sometimes I can barely comment on the information contained in a book, depending on how good the translation feels.\n\nThat being said, I can only offer a few general impressions about the book. Any value judgments would be unfair. So I’ll just gather those impressions into two main bunches: positive and negative.\n\nBut First: Let’s Meet Katharina\n\nFor those who aren’t familiar with Katharina Pawlowna, she was the beloved sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. An when I say “beloved,” I mean it – there are letters between them that are downright flirtatious. In terms of personality, she was willful, spoiled, and self-centered to the near-exclusion of all other personal characteristics. Every situation needed to be about her, and if she deployed her not inconsiderable intelligence or charm, you could damn well bet there was a reason for it. She was an ambition monster, to borrow a phrase I’ve seen recently online. She felt she was destined to rule and do great things, and she pursued that goal with a persistence that any modern CEO would envy.\n\nWhen Napoleon expressed an only-partly-serious wish to marry her (before he’d ever divorced Josephine), the family panicked and rushed an already-existing plan to marry her to a Prince Georg of Oldenburg-Holstein to get her off the marriage market. The marriage was a happy one, but Katharina definitely wore the pants in that relationship. She and Prince Georg had two sons, but unfortunately Georg died in late 1812, during one of the most dramatic events of Russian history: Napoleon’s invasion of and subsequent retreat from Russia.\n\nAlways ambitious, Katharina decided her second husband needed to be more powerful and influential – so she, by extension, could wield some or all of that power. Efforts to sound out the Austrian emperor did not go well. Neither did the Romanovs’ efforts to match Katharina with an archduke. When Katharina latched onto Crown Prince Wilhelm of Württemberg, it was an ideal match: Wilhelm was also ambitious and prideful.\n\nAt the time, it seemed like there was a possibility he might play a role in the future of a united Germany…and Katharina liked the idea of being a potential future German empress. That didn’t work out, in part due to her brother’s pact with the King of Prussia and Emperor of Austria to hold the status quo in Europe after all the Napoleonic upheavals. Monarchical legitimacy was the name of their game, and creating an entirely new empire was a little too much change all at once. Katharina’s ambition to rule was fulfilled, but only on a smaller scale, when she became Queen of Württemberg. She threw herself into the role with charity and social work, creating lasting change aimed at helping women get an education, as well as helping the lower and middle classes save for a rainy day in new national savings banks.\n\nBut Katharina was not a healthy woman. After her first husband died in late 1812, she developed a sickness where she’d have periods every day of total stiffness/partial paralysis. It happened pretty much daily for up to an hour. Over time, those episodes eased up, to the point where she felt strong and capable in 1815 – or at least that’s the impression she wanted to give. In reality, she was probably still deeply unhealthy, and exerted a superhuman effort to keep anyone from knowing how ill she was. So when she died at the age of 30 in early 1819, the world wondered: why? Conspiracy theories developed that she’d seen her husband cheating on her and basically died of heartbreak and shock. That’s almost certainly bunk. In reality, it was a combination of things: a worn-down immune system, a cold that turned into something worse, an erysipelas attack, and possibly also a stroke. There was no way her body could fight all these things at once, and she died leaving Wilhelm of Württemberg with their two young daughters.\n\nPositive Impressions\n\nJena provided a really good chapter summarizing the conspiracy theories around her death. It was so unbelievable to people at the time that a seemingly healthy woman would have died after what seemed like a light illness in just a few days. But he makes the point that she wasn’t a healthy woman – that was the impression she worked so hard to give, and it worked a little too well in the end. This was the best and most balanced chapter in the whole book. Really well done.\n\nJena provided quotes from onlookers who both admired and detested Katharina. She did not have a good showing in Britain, for example, pissing off nearly everyone who had to interact with her, including the Prince Regent (future King George IV). But there were plenty of intellectuals and writers, for example, who left kind words about her. The impression I came away with was that she could be whatever the situation called for: charming, flirtatious, intellectual, ruthless, or analytical…and she would deploy any or all of these attributes at any time if there was something in it for her. This makes her a hard person to understand, let alone like, and reading this in translation did not help with that.\n\nNegative Impressions\n\nFor a book that clocked in at 124,179 words of text (plus notes and sources), I feel like there wasn’t a lot of information in it. The book contains a lot of authorial evaluation and judgment of her character. And since her character (as it’s represented here) was all about ambition, we’re pounded over the head with what feels like a million repetitions of her goals and dreams.\n\nBased on the translation, it seemed like Jena contradicted himself multiple times by building up Katharina’s influence over a person or situation and then discrediting it all by saying she actually had no effect at all. Despite all her scheming, and man, this woman schemed more than Blair Waldorf in Gossip Girl, I came away with the impression that the only real historic effects she had were (1) the dismissal of Speransky as Tsar Alexander’s advisor, and (2) her charity work in Württemberg, still remembered today. Jena made a big deal about Catherine’s total commitment to fighting Napoleon, and her effort to get her brother to fight him. But, because of the sketchy translation, I was unable to grasp what those efforts actually amounted to. I’m heading for a couple English-language biographies of Alexander next to see if I can get a better picture of the situation.\n\nAnd what about that tense relationship between Katharina and her sister, Anna? Well, it wasn’t discussed at all here – but I gleaned a few facts that may offer indirect support. And, like I mentioned, it doesn’t seem like Katharina was easy to like at all. It might have been as simple as that.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nIf you’re Romanov-obsessed and read German, yes. For one, there’s not that much information on her available in English. If you’re not obsessed and only casually curious about the Romanovs, I’d say skip this and read her correspondence with Tsar Alexander I instead (free via Archive.org). If that intrigues you (and you can read German), dive deeper with this book.\n\nBack to top\n\nKing Leopold’s Ghost\n\nSubtitle: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa\n\nAuthor: Adam Hochschild\n\nPublisher: Mariner Books\n\nYear: 2020 (first edition, 1998)\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI bought this eBook because, well, I’d always meant to read this book and never quite gotten around to it in the million (okay, twenty-plus) years since it was published. I knew Leopold II, King of the Belgians was a bad dude – but I didn’t know how bad. I was more familiar with the details of his effort to disinherit his daughters, and his penchant for underage girls. This book filled in the details on the biggest reason why he’s an asshole: his all-encompassing greed and utter lack of humanity when it came to exploiting the people and resources of the Congo.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nLong story short: During the late 19th century “scramble for Africa,” Leopold took advantage of European explorers and missionaries and used them to seize control of the Congo, which he took possession of as a personal colony in 1885. And then he ruthlessly exploited its people and resources to make money. His decisions led to the mass murder of an estimated 10 million of Africans. Let that sink in – an estimated 10 million. Leopold never cared about anything but profit, earned mostly from wild rubber. Prestige and power were nice, but secondary to the cold, hard cash. The court of public opinion eventually forced him to sell the Congo to Belgium, but the damage had been done. And he was never sorry about any of it, not until the day he died.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. This book is very well-written – Hochschild uses fictional techniques like foreshadowing and cliffhanger chapter endings. Like every other English major on the planet, I read Heart of Darkness in college. Like 99% of the books I read in college, it meant little to me at the time. But now, as a 45-year-old woman, with a better idea of how hard and horrible the world can be, the tie-in with the subject matter of Conrad’s most famous novel was very appealing.\n\nHochschild populates this book with a lot of memorable characters: writer Joseph Conrad, explorer Henry Stanley (of “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” fame), and of course, the chief asshole, Leopold himself. What’s even better is the depiction of courageous people who saw what was happening and spoke up: English shipping clerk Edmund Morel, African-American journalist George Washington Williams, African-American missionary William Sheppard, and Irish nationalist Roger Casement are all worth meeting. Mark Twain, Booker T. Washington, and Arthur Conan Doyle also make appearances.\n\nTidbits\n\nLeopold married Archduchess Marie Henriette of Austria. A month later, she wrote, “If God hears my prayers, I shall not go on living much longer.” Doesn’t that break your heart? (35)\n\nWhen Leopold visited Seville as a student, he was more interested in money than in sightseeing. He wrote, “I am very busy here going through the Indies archives and calculating the profit which Spain made then and makes now out of her colonies.” (36)\n\nThe U.S. was the first country to officially recognize the Congo as Leopold’s possession. Stellar work.\n\nThe invention of the rubber bicycle tire in 1887 transformed the Congo into Leopold’s personal ATM. His soldiers and employees forced Africans to gather rubber for them. If they didn’t meet Leopold’s quotas, they were maimed or murdered or their families were kidnapped or maimed or murdered or starved or all of the above.\n\nWhen Leopold’s daughter Stephanie remarried a Hungarian count (her first husband, Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, famously died by suicide), Leopold would only refer to her second husband as “that shepherd.” (135)\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II and his wife both loathed Leopold. Wilhelm once called him “Satan and Mammon in one person.” (239) Augusta Viktoria once had a room he had stayed in exorcised after he left.\n\nAccording to the author’s estimate, the population of the Congo was halved between 1880 and 1920, reduced from 20 million to 10 million. That’s due to disease, starvation, and murder.\n\nAfter Leopold’s death, it took decades for investigators to uncover where he’d hidden all his money. It was a trail of shell company after shell company. By 1923, they finally got a handle on things and realized some of the money he’d appropriated had belonged to his sister Charlotte, still alive but mentally ill.\n\nJules Marchal, a leading historian who studied Leopold and the Congo, estimates that Leopold made 220 million francs ($1.1 billion in today’s money) from the Congo. (277)\n\n9 out of 10 New York publishers turned down this book because they thought American readers would not be interested in African history.\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\nKings over the Water\n\nSubtitle: The Saga of the Stuart Pretenders\n\nAuthor: Theo Aronson\n\nPublisher: Lume Books\n\nYear: 2020 (digital edition)\n\nAvailable at: Amazon\n\nI picked this up through Kindle Unlimited because I always enjoy Theo Aronson’s books and I didn’t know much about the Stuarts post-1688. Aside from Bonnie Prince Charlie in Season 2 of Outlander, that is. I’d seen references to James II’s wife, Mary of Modena, as a model queen and wondered what Aronson would have to say about her. Turns out, what I’d heard was right.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nKing James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, but that didn’t end Stuart hopes of ruling Britain. James’s son, also named James (the Old Pretender), tried to invade and conquer Britain in 1715. It didn’t work out. It also didn’t work out in 1745, when James’s grandson, Prince Charles Edward (the Young Pretender) tried it. This book covers both of those famous risings, and a whole lot more.\n\nThe story begins with James II and Queen Mary of Modena as they fled England for France and set up a shadow court under the good graces of King Louis XIV. After a few initial missteps with Louis’s brother, Monsieur (a stickler for etiquette), Mary of Modena became the respected leader of the Jacobin court in exile. Her grace, intelligence, sensible judgment, and devotion to her aging husband made her a beloved figure. Their children, James III (to Legitimists) and Princess Louise, were the shining lights of the Stuart dynasty for a short time.\n\nUnfortunately, the beautiful and intelligent Louise died young. And James III failed to regain his father’s throne. He married a Polish princess, Maria Clementina Sobieska, and had two sons: Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) and Henry. Although both of those sons were known as King Charles III and King Henry IX by their followers, they became “also-rans” in the history books, both dying with no legitimate male heirs.\n\nWhen Henry IX died in 1807, the Stuart legitimists had to consult the family tree to find their next pretender. By that point, it was mostly an exercise in nomenclature. The Hanoverian kings had a firm grip on Britain, and no foreign power was going to risk supporting a Stuart in yet another rising. It’s a fascinating story, made even better by Aronson’s eye for anecdotes and personal details.\n\nShould You Read It?\n\nYes. I really enjoyed this, mostly because the stories were new to me. Aronson is a good writer who always keeps the focus on the personalities rather than the politics, which I appreciate so much.\n\nTidbits\n\nJames II and Mary of Modena’s son, Prince James Francis Edward, was subject to a strange ritual of 18th century childcare: “He should have been swaddled at all times, not only at night, ran one criticism; and was it really necessary, ran another, for him to be tossed up, gurgling, into the air in order to prevent him from contracting what the English called ‘Ricket’?” (81)\n\nJames II had two illegitimate sons with Arabella Churchill. The first, the Duke of Berwick, joined the French army and married the daughter of one of Mary of Modena’s ladies-in-waiting. The second, Henry Fitzjames, was described by the Duc de Saint-Simon as “the stupidest man on earth.” Ouch. (106)\n\nJames III (the Old Pretender) fell in love with Princess Benedicta of Modena, a cousin of his mother and the oldest daughter of the reigning duke. But the duke was too afraid to piss off King George I by letting his daughter marry the guy angling for George’s throne. He refused to allow the marriage, and broke James’s heart.\n\nEmperor Charles V arrested James III’s intended bride, Maria Clementina Sobieska, at the request of King George I. George really didn’t want James to marry the wealthy Polish princess, produce heirs, and continue the struggle to regain the throne. George even offered a huge bribe to anyone else who would marry Maria Clementina. She refused all comers, however, since she’d had a dream that she would one day be queen of England.\n\nWhile in hiding in Scotland after his failed rising, Charles III (the Young Pretender, Bonnie Prince Charlie) fell in love (or at least in “like”) with his host’s niece, Clementina Walkinshaw – who had been named after Charles’s mother. Previously uninterested in women in general, he developed a bond with Clementina because she wasn’t out to seduce him. It was one of the few untroubled relationships he ever had with a woman. Years later, in 1752, they ended up living together in Ghent. Aronson says it’s unclear if he asked her to join him or if she volunteered. (241)\n\nIn 1750, Charles III converted to Anglicanism. I don’t know why I never knew this before. What a silly choice – it alienated all his Catholic supporters, and didn’t win him any new English ones. He was already a lost cause and they knew it.\n\nBonnie Prince Charlie had an illegitimate daughter with Clementina Walkinshaw named Charlotte, who late took the title Duchess of Albany. He did not have any children with his wife, Princess Louise of Stolberg (Queen Louise, to Stuart legitimists). When they married, she was a beautiful but poor 20-year-old and he was 52. Ouch.\n\nBack to top\n\nKoningin Sophie\n\n1818-1877\n\nEditor: C.A. Tamse\n\nPublisher: De Walburg Press\n\nYear: 1984\n\nAvailable at: AbeBooks\n\nThis is a memoir written by Queen Sophie herself, with editing, footnotes, and commentary by Professor C.A. Tamse. Oh man, I wish I had known this book existed earlier. I don’t know why it took me so long to realize it existed, but here we are. Even reading this in automated translation from Dutch, you can tell that Sophie’s a good writer. Like, really good. Her characterizations are sharp and her critiques are biting.\n\nWhat’s It About?\n\nSophie was born a princess of Württemberg in 1818. Her father was King Wilhelm I and her mother was Queen Catherine (born Grand Duchess Ekaterina Pavlovna). This memoir covers her mother’s death (early 1819), her father’s remarriage, her education, and the plaguing question of who Sophie would marry. She cuts off this memoir when she marries Prince Willem of Orange, a marriage that did not go well, to put it mildly.\n\nFor more background on Sophie, you can check out my video. I did col"
