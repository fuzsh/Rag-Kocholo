        "text": "Charles Michael, Duke of Mecklenburg (German language: Carl Michael Herzog zu Mecklenburg; 17 June [O.S. 5 June] 1863 – 6 December 1934) was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, heir presumptive to the throne of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and from 1918 head of the Grand Ducal House.\n\nLife in Russia[]\n\nHe was born in Oranienbaum, Russia, a grandson of Grand Duke Georg of Mecklenburg-Strelitz via his second son Duke Georg August of Mecklenburg (1824–1876) and his wife Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna of Russia, a granddaughter of Emperor Paul I of Russia. Charles Michael studied at the University of Strasbourg and gained a PhD.[1] As he was born into the Russian branch of the Grand Ducal house of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Charles Michael and his older brother Duke George Alexander, both served in the Russian Imperial Army with Charles Michael achieving the rank of Lieutenant General.[2] When his brother died in 1909 Charles Michael was appointed the guardian of his children Katharina, Marie, Natalia and Georg by Adolf Friedrich V.[3]\n\nOn 24 June 1914 two weeks after the death of his cousin Grand Duke Adolf Friedrich V, Charles Michael wrote to the new Grand Duke Adolf Friedrich VI informing him that he wished to renounce his rights to the throne of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.[4] On 7 August shortly after the outbreak of World War I he became a naturalised Russian citizen.[4]\n\nIn March, 1917 Charles Michael was arrested and made to appear before the Russian parliament the Duma.[5] He later fled to the Caucasus region.[6]\n\nHeir to Strelitz[]\n\nThe Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Friedrich Franz IV wrote to Charles Michael informing him that his cousin Adolf Friedrich VI had died on 23 February 1918 and that as he was first in the line of succession he was being called to the throne.[6] A petition to accept the throne was also sent to Charles Michael by the citizens of Mecklenburg-Strelitz as they wanted to maintain their independence and not be united with Mecklenburg-Schwerin.[6] However Charles Michael never received it so he wrote a private letter confirming his desire to renounce his rights to reign in Mecklenburg-Strelitz although the letter did not reach Friedrich Franz IV, who was acting as regent for Mecklenburg-Strelitz, until January 1919[6] after the fall of the German monarchies. As a result the succession issue could not be resolved in time and the two Mecklenburg grand duchies became separate free states in the Weimar Republic.\n\nCharles Michael eventually left Russia with his family arriving first in France before going into exile in Denmark.[6] While there he served as Chairman of the Mutual Charitable Society for Russian Officers in Denmark.[7] In 1921 he was paid five million marks by the Mecklenburg government in return for renouncing his claim to the Strelitz throne.[8] In April, 1930 he returned to Germany and took up residence at his estate, Remplin castle.[9]\n\nCharles Michael adopted his nephew Georg, Count of Carlow who was the morganatic son of his brother Duke George Alexander of Mecklenburg (1859–1909) on 11 September 1928 and confirmed in the courts of Malchin on 5 October 1928.[10] Charles Michael died unmarried in Remplin, Germany and was succeeded as head of the Grand Ducal house by his nephew and adopted son the former Count of Carlow, Duke Georg of Mecklenburg.[11]\n\nTitles, styles and honours[]\n\nTitles and styles[]\n\n17 June 1863 – 6 December 1934: His Royal Highness Duke Charles Michael of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nHonours[]\n\nOrder of St. Andrew\n\nMecklenburg-Strelitz House Order of the Wendish Crown (Grand Cross with the crown in Ore)\n\nAncestry[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nErstling, Frank; Frank Saß, Eberhard Schulze, Harald Witzke (April 2001). \"Das Fürstenhaus von Mecklenburg-Strelitz\" (in German).
