Ironically, because the name means \"she who was resurrected,\" rumors of Anastasia's survival persisted long after the Russian Revolution and several imposters claimed her identity. Although these stories provided material for many books, movies, and plays, in reality she was killed with the rest of her immediate family in July 1918.\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
