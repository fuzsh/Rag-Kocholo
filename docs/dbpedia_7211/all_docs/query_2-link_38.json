Although he was a German Prince, Duke Georg Alexander lived in Russia throughout his life. He was a great-grandson of Emperor Paul I and a cousin of Emperor Alexander III. Duke Georg Alexander pursued a career as an officer in the Russian army and was Major General, Commander of the Life Guard Dragoon Regiment.\n\nFurther pieces of this service, including a tureen of conforming design to the present lot, are held in the collection of Pavlovsk Palace.
