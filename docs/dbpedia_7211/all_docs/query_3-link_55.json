        "text": "Legitimation\n\nThe Empress died on 8 June 1880, and her widower promptly married Catherine a month later in a secret, morganatic ceremony in the presence of five witnesses, though none belonged to the Imperial family.[3][6][9] The Emperor had believed he was in danger of assassination, and was consequently in favor of a speedy remarriage, as this would help to provide for his second family.[6][10][11] The marriage was heavily criticized, with one source speculating that it \"deprived [Alexander's] image of both the moral and cultural attributes that had come to justify autocratic power\".[12] Catherine took the title Princess Romanovskaia-Yurevskaia and the status of Serene Highness, along with her children.[nb 2][11][nb 3] All the children began using the patronymic Aleksandovich (Aleksandovna for the girls), causing fears that despite the morganatic status of the marriage, the Emperor was contemplating giving them dynastic rights.[3][6] George's birth had already caused concern among the Imperial family, because he was viewed as a threat to the true heir, who often had strong disagreements with his father.[4] Rumours were constantly circulating that George would be the tsarevich's replacement.[13]\n\nIt was well known that Alexander regarded George as a \"true Russian\", remarking in 1881 of George: \"This is a real Russian; in him at least there flows only Russian blood\".[3][6] Furthermore, although the order of the succession had been made clear in a law of 1797, the Emperor still had the power to do as he wished.[3] One incident that caused concern occurred at a family reception, when Alexander playfully asked his son: \"Tell us Goga, what is your name?\" George replied, \"My name is Prince Georgy Alexandrovich Yuryevsky\", to which the Emperor declared, \"I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Prince Yuryevsky! And wouldn't you like to become a grand duke, young man?\" This conversation was the Emperor's barely concealed attempt to test his relatives' reactions, were he to legally adopt and make his son and daughters a grand duke and grand duchesses.[1] The princess however renounced all succession rights on behalf of her son, who was eight years old at the time.[7] The morganatic nature of the marriage meant that not only did Catherine not automatically become empress, but the children had absolutely no succession rights.[8]: 23\n\nThe newly married Princess Yuryevsky and her son made their first official appearance on 4 October during a military review of the Cossacks, with George wearing a Cossack uniform.[13] Alexander begged his heir to accept her into the family, and introduced him to George as his \"eldest brother\" whom he was \"to love and obey\" and by whom he would be looked after.[13] The year they married, the Emperor arranged financial security for his second family and asked the Tsarevich to care for them when he died.[3][nb 4] Catherine and their children began to appear at official family dinners, where George enjoyed playing with the Tsarevich's children, to the displeasure of the future emperor's wife.[13]\n\nThere is evidence that Alexander was preparing to crown his second wife as empress-consort, much as Peter the Great had done with his wife Marta Helena Skowrońska, who became Catherine I.[15] Indeed, the Emperor ordered research be done on the subject in order to evaluate how Catherine's coronation might be achieved.[16] The Tsarevich was so upset by these plans that he threatened to leave for Denmark with his family, but he chose to stay after the Emperor threatened to replace him as heir by his half-brother.[15][17] Another rumour suggested the Emperor might abdicate, at the urging of his wife, and go to live with her and their children in France.[18]\n\nDeath of the Emperor\n\nEmperor Alexander II died on 13 March 1881, when after visiting his cousin Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna he was assassinated on the road leading back to the Winter Palace.[19][20] His death stopped all plans for Catherine's coronation, which some considered fortunate, as they feared it would have caused lasting damage to the monarchy.[15] In his Will, Alexander II left his widow the same amount he bequeathed to each of his sons from his first marriage.[10] Despite his earlier opposition, the Emperor's son, now Alexander III, made an official visit of condolence to Catherine and gave her an additional allowance as well as a small palace for her to live in after she left the Winter Palace.[10][21] George and his family attended the Emperor's funeral, but they were ignored as much as possible by the Imperial family, until Alexander III himself approached his father's widow and spoke to her.[8]: 7 His wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna was nearby, but as she had been greatly opposed to the princess, she hesitated to acknowledge her. After being embraced by Catherine, however, they both broke down crying, and George and his sisters kissed Maria's hand.[8]: 7 The couple left, and the widow and children went to another private chapel for a separate mass, as she was not to be allowed to mingle with the Imperial family in the more public funeral planned for later.[8]: 8\n\nAlexander's widow later published her memoirs, Alexander II: Unedited Details of his Private Life, and Concerning his Death, in which she claimed that as the Emperor's favorite child, George was the \"child of his private home and life, finding in him the child of the Russian nation to which he had given so much affection\".[22]\n\nMarriage and death\n\nIn 1901, George was described as a \"tall and rather stout man of thirty\", who partly resembled his father in his looks and bearing.[24] On 16 February 1900 in Nice, he married Countess Aleksandra Konstantinovna von Zarnekau, described by some as \"a very beautiful woman\".[24][26] Her birth was similar to his own, as she was the daughter of Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg and his morganatic marriage with Georgian Princess Agrippina Japaridze, Countess von Zarnekau.[2] The only member of the Russian Imperial family to attend was Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich, himself banished due to his morganatic marriage to Countess Sophie of Merenberg, the sister-in-law of George's sister, Olga.[26] Emperor Nicholas II disapproved of the union because he disliked Aleksandra's parents, and consequently the couple abandoned their St. Petersburg residence and went to live abroad.[23]\n\nAfter their marriage, the couple planned to reside in a St. Petersburg palace that had been built by Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich and purchased by his brother Alexander II for his morganatic wife; Catherine in turn passed it down to their son.[27] George and Aleksandra had one son:\n\nAlexander Georgiyevich Yuryevsky, Prince Yuryevsky (21 December 1900 – 29 February 1988); married Ursule Anne Marie Beer de Grüneck and had a son named Hans-George (b. 1961),[2] who married Katharina Verhagen (2003-2012) and then Silvia Trumpp (2013).\n\nThe couple became unhappy, and Aleksandra secured a dissolution on the grounds of \"neglect and ill treatment by her husband\", and she subsequently divorced him in 1909.[28] Financial troubles were another explanation attributed to their divorce.[23] Aleksandra remarried quickly.\n\nAfter a long and incurable illness, Prince George died on 13 September 1913 in a private hospital in Marburg, Hesse.[2][23] He was buried at St. Elizabeth's Church in Wiesbaden, Hesse."
