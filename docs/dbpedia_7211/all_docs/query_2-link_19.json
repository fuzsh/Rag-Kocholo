        "text": "Category Archives: Mecklenburg-Strelitz Royals\n\nCaroline Mariane of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Crown Princess of Denmark\n\nby Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nCaroline Mariane was the second wife of the future King Frederik VII of Denmark. Born in Neustrelitz in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, on January 10, 1821, she was the second of the two daughters and the third of the four children of Georg, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Marie of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nCaroline Mariane had three siblings:\n\nLuise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1818–1842), unmarried, died of tuberculosis at age 24\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1819–1904), married Princess Augusta of Cambridge, had one surviving son Adolf Friedrich V, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nGeorg August of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1824–1876) married Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna of Russia, had four children\n\nIn 1839, King Christian VIII of Denmark succeeded to the Danish throne. His son Frederik, who had divorced his first wife, was now Crown Prince and needed to marry again. He heard about Caroline Mariane who had been taught Danish by a Danish poet and thought she might make a good wife. 33-year-old Frederik and 20-year-old Caroline Mariane were married in Neustrelitz in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on June 10, 1841. On June 21, they arrived in Denmark and made a festive entrance in Copenhagen.\n\nThe marriage was childless and unhappy. Frederik’s bad temperament, excessive drinking, and shameless womanizing put a great strain on Caroline Mariane. She was young, inexperienced, shy, and nervous, and no match for Frederik’s boisterous personality. In 1844, Caroline Mariane went to visit her parents and refused to return to Denmark. The couple divorced on September 30, 1846. The divorce documents stated: “The divorce was due to the inherited morbidity and broken health of the Princess.” The truth was that Caroline Mariane had been completely run down by her husband’s wild and unbearable life and that Frederik was pleased to reconnect with his mistress Louise Rasmussen who became his morganatic third wife in 1850.\n\nCaroline Mariane lived quietly in Neustrelitz where her parents built the Carolinenpalais for her in 1850. She retained her Danish titles after her divorce and never remarried. Nor did Caroline Mariane ever speak about her former husband except when she described him to Danish visitors as “He was much too bizarre!” In 1860, Caroline Mariane donated funds for the construction of the Carolinenstift, a hospital in Neustrelitz.\n\nCaroline Mariane died in Neustrelitz on June 1, 1876, at the age of 55. She was buried at the traditional burial site of the Grand Ducal Family of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the Johanniterkirche (Church of St. John) (in German) in Mirow, now in Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The marriage was unhappy from the beginning, and Friedrich mostly ignored his wife who was far more intelligent than he was. Despite this, the couple had 12 children:\n\nPrince Joseph (born and died 1786) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Katharina Charlotte (1787 – 1847) – married Prince Paul of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Caroline (born and died 1788) – died at birth\n\nJoseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1789-1868) – married Duchess Amalie of Württemberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Friederike (born and died 1791) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Therese (1792-1854) – married King Ludwig I of Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Luise (1794-1825) – married Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, had issue\n\nPrince Franz Friedrich (1795-1800) – died in childhood\n\nGeorg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1796-1853) – married Duchess Marie Luise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had issue\n\nPrince Friedrich Wilhelm (1801-1870) – unmarried\n\nPrince Maximilian Karl (born and died 1803) – died in infancy\n\nPrince Eduard Karl (1804-1852) – married (1) Princess Amalie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had issue; (2) Princess Luise Caroline Reuss of Greiz, had issue\n\nDespite her husband’s disinterest, Charlotte became much loved by the people of Saxe-Hildburghausen. She gave very generously to causes and charities that helped the poor and funded numerous programs that provided education and training to the less fortunate. Charlotte also supported the arts and brought many musicians and artists to court. She also became known as one of the best singers of her time. Having taken lessons as a girl in Hanover, the Duchess often sang in both court and church events.\n\nEight years before her husband became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, Charlotte died after a long illness in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany on May 14, 1818. Per her wishes, she was to be buried in the new city cemetery (Stadtfriedhof) in Hildburghausen. She was initially buried in the Hildburghausen Castle Church in the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany. Her remains were moved to the Hildburghausen Stadtfriedhof in 1819, the first burial in the new cemetery. Her tomb, a large bronzed pillar atop what is known as the Ducal Mound, was completed in 1824. The mound is now also the burial site of several of the previous Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen and their wives. Other members of the Saxe-Altenburg family are buried elsewhere in the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born Princess Marie Wilhelmine Friederike on January 21, 1796, in Hanau, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, now in Hesse, Germany.

In 1701, the last division created the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna recognized both Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz as grand duchies. Carl II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz became the first Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nOn, February 23, 1918, Grand Duke Adolf Friedrich VI of Mecklenburg-Schwerin died by suicide. The heir presumptive was serving with the Russian military and had made it known that he wished to renounce his rights of succession. Friedrich Franz IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, served as Regent for the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The regency lasted only nine months, as on November 14, 1918, Friedrich Franz IV was forced to abdicate as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, as well as the Regent of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Today the territory encompassing the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\n********************\n\nGrand Duke Georg was born in Hanover, Electorate of Hanover, now in the German state of Lower Saxony, on August 12, 1779, to the future Carl II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and his first wife, Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nGeorg had nine siblings. His mother three days after giving birth to her last child from childbirth complications:\n\nCharlotte Georgine (1769-1818) – married Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, had issue\n\nCaroline Auguste (1771-1773) – died in childhood\n\nGeorg Carl (1772-1773) – died in infancy\n\nTherese (1773-1839) – married Karl Alexander, Prince of Thurn and Taxis, had issue\n\nFriedrich Georg (born and died 1774) – died in infancy\n\nLuise (1776-1810) – married King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia, had issue\n\nFriederike (1778-1841) – married(1) Prince Ludwig Carl of Prussia, had issue; (2) Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Solms-Braunfels, had issue; (3) King Ernst August I of Hanover, had issue\n\nFriedrich Karl (1781-1783) – died in childhood\n\nAuguste Albertine (1782-1782) – died in infancy\n\nGeorg had one half-sibling from his father’s second marriage to his mother’s sister Charlotte of Hesse-Darmstadt who, like her sister also died from childbirth complications.\n\nKarl (1785-1837) – unmarried\n\nGeorg’s early years were spent in Hanover, where his father served as Governor-General. Following the death of his stepmother Charlotte, the family moved to Darmstadt, Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, now in the German state of Hesse, where Georg and his siblings were raised primarily by their maternal grandmother. As second in line for the ducal throne, Georg was educated with the expectation of one day assuming the throne. In 1794, his childless uncle, Duke Adolf Friedrich IV, died. Georg’s father became the reigning Duke, while Georg took on the title of Hereditary Prince. Georg began studying at the University of Rostock, in Rostock, the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, before moving to Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, now in the German state of Brandenburg, to continue his education. He later spent two years traveling before returning to become involved in the running of the government.\n\nIn 1807, Georg represented his father in Paris to negotiate the duchy’s entry into the Confederation of the Rhine. He again represented his father seven years later at the Congress of Vienna. Through his efforts, Mecklenburg-Strelitz was raised to a Grand Duchy, with Georg becoming the Hereditary Grand Duke. He became Grand Duke on November 6, 1816, upon his father’s death.\n\nThe following year, on August 12, 1817, Georg married Princess Marie of Hesse-Kassel. She was the daughter of Landgrave Freidrich of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen. Georg and Marie had four children:\n\nPrincess Luise (1818-1842) – unmarried\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1819-1904) – married Princess Augusta of Cambridge, had issue\n\nPrincess Caroline Mariane (1821-1876) – married the future King Frederik VII of Denmark, no issue, divorced\n\nPrince Georg August (1824-1876) – married Grand Duchess Ekaterina Mikhailovna of Russia, had issue\n\nComing to the grand ducal throne, Georg found Mecklenburg-Strelitz in great debt and in need of much rebuilding. To eliminate much of the debt, he sold several towns to Prussia that had been given to the Grand Duchy at the Congress of Vienna. He abolished serfdom in 1820 and worked to raise the education standards, building schools and instituting compulsory education. He made vast improvements to the infrastructure which would help to energize the grand duchy’s economy.\n\nAfter a reign of nearly 54 years, Grand Duke Georg died in Neustrelitz, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, on September 6, 1860, at the age of 81. He is buried in the New Crypt at the Johanniterkirche in Mirow, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He was succeeded by his son, Friedrich Wilhelm.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Today the territory encompassing the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\n********************\n\nCarl II, the first Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was born Duke Carl Ludwig Friedrich Of Mecklenburg on October 10, 1741, at Mirow Castle in Mirow, Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He was the sixth of ten children of Duke Karl Ludwig of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mirow and Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen. His siblings were:\n\nChristiane (1735-1794) – unmarried\n\nCaroline (born and died 1736) – died in infancy\n\nAdolf Friedrich IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1738-1794) – unmarried\n\nElisabeth Christine (1739-1741) – died in early childhood\n\nSophie Luise (1740-1742) – died in early childhood\n\nErnst Gottlob Albert (1742-1814) – unmarried\n\nCharlotte (1744-1818) – married King George III of the United Kingdom, had issue\n\nGotthelf (born and died 1745) – died in infancy\n\nGeorg August (1748-1785) – unmarried\n\nCarl was raised in Mirow and received his education under the direction of Reverend Gottlob Burchard Genzmer. As the second son of the heir-presumptive to the Dukedom of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, there was little expectation that Carl would one day take the throne. However, his father died in June 1752, and several months later, his uncle, the reigning Duke, died in December. Carl’s elder brother became Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Carl was now the heir-presumptive.\n\nIn 1755, Carl left home and began serving in the Hanoverian army, where he had first been given a commission at just four years old. He served for several years before taking a year off to study in Switzerland. His ties to Hanover strengthened in 1761 when his sister married King George III of Great Britain, who was also the Elector of Hanover. The following year, he traveled to Portugal to help in the reorganization of the Portuguese Army. Upon his return in 1763, Carl was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in the Hanoverian Army, and in 1776, he was appointed Governor-General of Hanover by his brother-in-law.\n\nOn September 18, 1768, in Darmstadt, Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, now in the German state of Hesse, Carl married Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Georg Wilhelm of Hesse-Darmstadt and Maria Luise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg. Carl and Friederike had ten children:\n\nCharlotte Georgine (1769-1818) – married Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, had issue\n\nCaroline Auguste (1771-1773) – died in early childhood\n\nGeorg Carl (1772-1773) – died in infancy\n\nTherese (1773-1839) – married Karl Alexander, Prince of Thurn and Taxis, had issue\n\nFriedrich Georg (born and died 1774) – died in infancy\n\nLuise (1776-1810) – married King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia, had issue\n\nFriederike (1778-1841) – married(1) Prince Ludwig Carl of Prussia, had issue; (2) Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Solms-Braunfels, had issue; (3) King Ernst August I of Hanover, had issue\n\nGeorg, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1779-1860) – married Marie of Hesse-Kassel, had issue\n\nFriedrich Karl (1781-1783) – died in early childhood\n\nAuguste Albertine (born and died 1782) – died in infancy\n\nFriederike died due to childbirth complications shortly after giving birth to their last child in May 1782. Two years later, Carl married Friederike’s younger sister Charlotte on September 28, 1784, in Darmstadt. Charlotte also died due to childbirth complications shortly after giving birth to their only child:\n\nKarl (1785-1837) – unmarried\n\nFollowing his wife’s death in 1785, Carl retired from military service, and stepped down as Governor-General of Hanover, receiving a generous pension and a promotion to the rank of Field Marshal. He took his family to Darmstadt to be near his wives’ family and spent several years traveling to visit his family both in Neustrelitz, Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Great Britain. In 1794, he was appointed President of the Imperial Credit Commission, tasked with avoiding the pending bankruptcy in the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. This role would be short-lived, as his brother died in June 1794, and Carl returned to Neustrelitz to take up his role as the new Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nAs Duke, Carl established a police force, promoted agriculture, reduced the number of districts within the duchy, and introduced compulsory education. The peaceful duchy was thrown into turmoil when Napoleon’s forces occupied the duchy in 1806. While many other German rulers were forced into exile, Carl’s position as the brother of the British Queen, and father of the Prussian Queen allowed him to remain in Strelitz during the occupation. He was later forced to join Napoleon’s Confederation of the Rhine and fight along with the French forces. However, Carl later began to rally the people of Mecklenburg-Strelitz to fight against the French Emperor and helped to bring about his defeat. In recognition of Carl’s efforts, the Duchy received several territorial gains at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. In June 1815, thanks primarily to the efforts of Carl’s son and heir, Mecklenburg-Strelitz was raised to a Grand Duchy with Carl becoming the first Grand Duke.\n\nAt the same time he became Grand Duke, Carl handed over most of his powers to his son, while remaining head of state. The following summer, he traveled to visit and spend time with his family throughout the German monarchies, where he developed an inflammation of the lungs. Despite appearing to recover, he fell ill again that autumn and died in Neustrelitz, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on November 6, 1816. His funeral was held eight days later in Mirow, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where he was buried in the New Crypt of the Johanniterkirche (link in German).\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Today the territory encompassing the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\n********************\n\nAdolf Friedrich VI was the last Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He was born on June 17, 1882 in Neustrelitz, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, the elder son of Adolf Friedrich V, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Elisabeth of Anhalt.\n\nAdolf Friedrich had three siblings:\n\nDuchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1878-1948) – married (1) Count Georges Jamatel, had issue, divorced; (2) Prince Julius Ernst of Lippe, had issue\n\nDuchess Jutta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1880-1946) – married Danilo, Crown Prince of Montenegro, no issue\n\nDuke Karl Borwin of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1888-1908) – unmarried, killed in a duel with his brother-in-law Count George Jametel, defending his sister’s honor\n\nAt his christening on July 19, 1882, he was given the names Adolf Friedrich Georg Ernst Albert Eduard. He had twelve godparents:\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Strelitz – his paternal grandfather\n\nDuke Friedrich I of Anhalt – his maternal grandfather\n\nPrince Eduard of Anhalt – his paternal uncle\n\nDuchess Ekaterina of Mecklenburg-Strelitz – his paternal great-aunt\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Prussia – his maternal great-aunt\n\nDuchess Agnes of Saxe-Altenburg – his maternal great-aunt\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge – his paternal great-uncle\n\nDuke Ernst I of Saxe-Altenburg – his maternal great-uncle\n\nThe Prince of Wales\n\nPrincess Helena of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nCrown Prince Friedrich of Prussia\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Franz II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nAdolf Friedrich was educated privately at home, and tutored for several years by the Protestant theologian Carl Horn. He then attended the Vitzthum-Gymnasium in Dresden along with his relative, and close friend, Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and in 1902, moved to Munich to study law.\n\nDuring this time, he was made a Lieutenant in the Prussian Army’s Grand Ducal Mecklenburg Grenadier Regiment No. 89. However, his active military career did not begin until after he had finished his studies when he joined the Prussian Army’s 1st Uhlan Guards Regiment in Potsdam. Just two years later, he became Hereditary Grand Duke upon his grandfather’s death and his father’s accession to the grand ducal throne.\n\nIn 1911, Adolf Friedrich resigned his army commission and returned to Neustrelitz to prepare for his future role. He also spent several summers living in the United Kingdom, having developed a strong love for the country, likely influenced by his grandmother, who was born Princess Augusta of Cambridge, and was a granddaughter of King George III of the United Kingdom. Adolf Friedrich took every opportunity to visit the United Kingdom. He often represented his father and grandfather at official functions, such as the funerals of Queen Victoria and King Edward VII, and the coronations of King Edward VII and King George V.\n\nUpon his father’s death in June 1914, he became the reigning Grand Duke as Adolf Friedrich VI. He had little time to adjust to his role as World War I was breaking out in Europe. He was given a commission as a colonel on the staff of the German 17th Division and served on the Western front through much of the war. In 1917, he was promoted to Major General.\n\nAfter years of being linked to various princesses throughout Europe including Viktoria Luise of Prussia, Patricia of Connaught, and Mary, Princess Royal, Adolf Friedrich’s close friend, Princess Daisy of Pless, set out to find him a bride. Soon it was settled that he would marry Princess Beninga Reuss of Köstritz, and negotiations began. However, a scandal brewing that needed to be dealt with first. Years earlier, when based in Potsdam, Adolf Friedrich had a relationship with a woman named Margit Höllrigl. Allegedly, he had proposed to her so that he could renounce his succession rights in favor of his younger brother. But his brother had since died, and he attempted to pay off Höllrigl to release him from any obligation of marriage. Höllrigl, however, had other plans. She claimed to have correspondence that linked Adolf Friedrich to “certain homosexual circles” and threatened to release them to the public unless he gave in to her demands for more money.\n\nWith World War I still raging, and the possibility of these letters being made public, Grand Duke Adolf Friedrich VI left his home in Neustrelitz, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, on the evening of February 23, 1918, to take his dog for a walk. The following morning, his body was found in a nearby canal with a gunshot wound to his head. He left behind a suicide note which suggested that a woman was attempting to smear his name. However, his close friend Princess Daisy of Pless suggested that he had developed severe depression over the war and the loss of his beloved grandmother.\n\nIn his will, he had requested that Duke Christian Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the son of his good friend Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV, become the new Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The heir presumptive Duke Carl Michael of Mecklenburg lived in Russia and had previously indicated that he wished to renounce his rights to the grand ducal throne. However, before the matter could be resolved, Germany became a republic and the various German sovereigns lost their thrones.\n\nFollowing his funeral, Adolf Friedrich VI was buried on Love Island, a small island off Castle Island in Mirow, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. Castle Island is the site of the Grand Ducal Palace and the Johanniterkirche, the traditional burial place of the Mecklenburg-Strelitz grand ducal family.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She had five siblings:\n\nLeopold, Hereditary Prince of Anhalt (1855-1886) – married Elisabeth of Hesse-Kassel, had issue\n\nFriedrich II, Duke of Anhalt (1856-1918) – married Marie of Baden, no issue\n\nEduard, Duke of Anhalt (1861-1918) – married Luise of Saxe-Altenburg, had issue\n\nPrince Aribert of Anhalt (1864-1933) – married Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein, no issue, marriage dissolved\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Anhalt (1868-1958) – married Sizzo, Prince of Schwarzburg, had issue\n\nElisabeth’s christening was held on October 1, 1857, at the Wörlitz Church. She had the following godparents:\n\nLeopold IV, Duke of Anhalt – her paternal grandfather\n\nDuchess Agnes of Saxe-Altenburg – her paternal aunt\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Anhalt – her paternal great-uncle\n\nQueen Elisabeth Luise of Prussia\n\nQueen Marie of Bavaria\n\nHer childhood was spent at the Hereditary Princely Palace in Dessau and the Wörlitz Palace, where she was educated privately by the family’s tutor and her governess. In 1871, her father succeeded as reigning Duke of Anhalt, and the family moved to the Residence Palace in Dessau.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1876, she first met her future husband, the future Grand Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He was the son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Princess Augusta of Cambridge. The two were second cousins once removed through their mutual descent from Carl II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They met again later that year when Adolf Friedrich was visiting some mutual relatives, and they became engaged on December 29, 1876. They married at the Dessau Palace in the Duchy of Anhalt, now in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, on April 17, 1877, and had four children:\n\nDuchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1878-1948) – married (1) Count Georges Jamatel, had issue; (2) Prince Julius Ernst of Lippe, had issue\n\nDuchess Jutta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1880-1946) – married Danilo, Crown Prince of Montenegro, no issue\n\nAdolf Friedrich VI, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1882-1918) – unmarried, died by suicide\n\nDuke Karl Borwin of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1888-1908) – unmarried, killed in a duel\n\nQuickly adapting to her role as Hereditary Grand Duchess, Elisabeth found a great ally in her mother-in-law, with whom she shared many interests. The two often hosted musical concerts and promoted numerous artists and musicians. She tried to use her public profile to bring attention to causes that were near to her heart, including nature and flowers, becoming an honorary member of the Association for the Protection of Birds. After becoming Grand Duchess in 1904 following her father-in-law’s death, she continued to support her causes while taking on a much more public role. Following the death of her youngest son in 1910, she established the Duke Carl Borwin Memorial Home in Neustrelitz, to provide a home for orphans and children in need.\n\nFollowing her husband’s death in 1914, she remained the first lady of Mecklenburg-Strelitz during the reign of her unmarried son and became very active with the Red Cross during World War I. Following the abolition of the monarchy in 1918, Elisabeth remained in Neustrelitz, taking up residence in the Park House which she had inherited earlier that year from her son. After the new government took over Neustrelitz Palace, Elisabeth continued to fight for compensation for the loss of the family’s property. Remaining active right up until her death, Elisabeth remained in Neustrelitz, often hosting visits from her daughters and grandchildren, and staying in close contact with relatives throughout Europe. Her last public appearance was on July 19, 1933, when she attended a ceremony at the Hohenziertz Palace commemorating the death of Queen Luise of Prussia, who had been born a Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nThe following day, on July 20, 1933, Grand Duchess Elisabeth died in Neustrelitz, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. Following her funeral, her remains were placed in the New Crypt at the Johanniterkirche in Mirow, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, alongside her husband and sons.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

At the time of his birth, he was 14th in line to the British throne, as his mother was a granddaughter of King George III of the United Kingdom. Adolf Friedrich was the highest-ranking person in the British succession who did not hold any British titles.\n\nHis christening took place at Schloss Neustrelitz on August 12, 1848. Given the names Adolf Friedrich August Viktor Ernst Adalbert Gustav Wilhelm Wellington, he had twelve godparents:\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom – his mother’s first cousin\n\nDowager Queen Adelaide of the United Kingdom – his mother’s aunt\n\nKing Ernst August of Hanover – his mother’s uncle\n\nGrand Duke Georg of Mecklenburg-Strelitz – his paternal grandfather\n\nGrand Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz – his paternal grandmother\n\nFriedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge – his maternal grandfather\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge – his maternal grandmother\n\nThe Duchess of Gloucester – his mother’s aunt\n\nDuke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nLandgrave Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel – both his mother’s and father’s uncle\n\nField Marshal Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington\n\nAt the age of 12, Adolf Friedrich became the Hereditary Grand Duke upon his father’s accession to the grand ducal throne. Initially educated privately at home, he later attended school in Dresden and then studied law at the University of Göttingen. After finishing his studies, he began a military career in the Prussian Army, where he fought during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and served on the General Staff of King Wilhelm I of Prussia. The following year, he represented his father at the proclamation of King Wilhelm I as German Emperor at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nWhile traveling through the various German monarchies in 1876, Adolf Freidrich met his future bride, Princess Elisabeth of Anhalt. She was the daughter of Friedrich I, Duke of Anhalt, and Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Altenburg. The two met again later that year while Adolf Friedrich was visiting some mutual relatives, and became engaged on December 29, 1876. The couple was second cousins once removed, through their mutual descent from Carl II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nAdolf Friedrich and Elisabeth married at Schloss Dessau in the Duchy of Anhalt, now in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, on April 17, 1877. After a honeymoon at Lake Geneva in Switzerland, they took up residence at the Hereditary Grand Ducal Palace in Neustrelitz, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\nThey had four children:\n\nDuchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1878-1948) – married (1) Count Georges Jamatel, had issue; (2) Prince Julius Ernst of Lippe, had issue\n\nDuchess Jutta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1880-1946) – married Danilo, Crown Prince of Montenegro, no issue\n\nAdolf Friedrich VI, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1882-1918) – unmarried\n\nDuke Karl Borwin of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1888-1908) – unmarried, killed in a duel\n\nAfter being the heir apparent for 43 years, Adolf Friedrich succeeded to the Grand Ducal throne on May 30, 1904, following his father’s death. He made efforts to soothe the rocky relationship with Prussia and brought a more militaristic atmosphere to the Grand Ducal court. Much more liberal than his father, he modernized the system of government, in keeping with the rest of the German Empire. Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin were the only German monarchies that did not have an elected assembly at the time.\n\nIn 1908, Adolf Friedrich introduced a ministerial form of government. However, he continued to meet resistance from the nobility when trying to make further reforms, such as introducing a new constitution. In 1912, after being thwarted at every attempt, Adolf Friedrich offered to donate $2.5 million of his own funds to the national treasury and forfeit some of his sovereign rights, in exchange for a new constitution. Again, he was denied by the nobility. This was just a small example of his vast personal wealth. In January 1914, just months before his death, he was reported to be the second richest German sovereign, with a personal fortune of $88.75 million (over $2 billion today).\n\nIn March 1914, Adolf Friedrich fell ill and underwent an operation in a private hospital in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, now in the German state of Brandenburg. He never fully recovered and died at the hospital on June 11, 1914. He is buried in the New Crypt at the Johanniterkirche in Mirow, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
