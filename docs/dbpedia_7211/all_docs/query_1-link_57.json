        "text": "As the first Word War was drawing to a close, throughout the month of November 1918, all 22 monarchs within the German Empire were either forced to abdicate, or stepped down of their own accord.\n\nAfter the Oberste Heeresleitung stated the German front was about to collapse and asked for immediate negotiation of an armistice, the cabinet of Chancellor Georg von Hertling resigned on September 30, 1918.\n\nHertling, with the support of Conrad Haußmann, Oberst Hans von Haeften [de] and Erich Ludendorff suggested Prince Maximilian of Baden as his successor and to have Emperor Wilhelm II appoint Prince Maximilian as Chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia.\n\nWhen Maximilian arrived in Berlin on October 1st, Emperor Wilhelm II convinced him to take the post and appointed him as Chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia on October 3, 1918. The message asking for an armistice went out on October 4th, hopefully to be accepted by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson.\n\nIn late October, Wilson’s third note seemed to imply that negotiations of an armistice would be dependent on the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II. On November 1st, Prince Maximilian wrote to all the ruling Princes of Germany, asking them whether they would approve of an abdication by the Emperor.\n\nOn November 6th, Prince Maximilian urged Emperor Wilhelm II to abdicate. The Emperor, who had fled from Berlin to the Spa, Belgium OHL-headquarters, was willing to consider abdication only as German Emperor, not as King of Prussia.\n\nAround November 4th, delegations of sailors had dispersed to all of the country’s big cities. By November 7th the revolution had seized all large coastal cities as well as Hanover, Braunschweig, Frankfurt on Main, and Munich.\n\nOn November 7th, Prince Maximilian met with Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and discussed his plan to go to Spa and convince Emperor Wilhelm II to abdicate. He was thinking about Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia, Wilhelm’s second son, being the Regent.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of the German Revolution in Berlin prevented Maximilian from implementing his plan. Ebert decided that to keep control of the socialist uprising, the Emperor had to resign quickly and that a new government was required.\n\nIn Munich, a “Workers’ and Soldiers’ Council” forced the last King of Bavaria, Ludwig III, to issue the Anif declaration. Bavaria was the first member state of the German Empire to be declared a Volksstaat, the People’s State of Bavaria, by Kurt Eisner of the USPD who asserted that Ludwig III had abdicated his throne via the Anif declaration.\n\nAbdication and flight\n\nEven though the uprising in Berlin had swelled into a revolution, Emperor Wilhelm II could not decide whether to abdicate. He recognized that he had likely lost his imperial crown, but he hoped to retain the Prussian kingship, believing that as monarch of two-thirds of Germany he could play a role in any new government.\n\nThis ultimately proved to be impossible. Emperor Wilhelm II had believed that he ruled as Emperor in a personal union with Prussia. Under the Constitution of the German Empire, however, the Empire was a federation of states under the permanent presidency of Prussia.\n\nThis meant that the Imperial Crown was legally tied to the Prussian Crown, and one crown could not be renounced without renouncing the other.\n\nGeneral Wilhelm Groener, then informed Emperor Wilhelm II that the army definitely would not fight to keep him on the throne. Army commander and lifelong royalist Paul von Hindenburg felt obliged, and with some embarrassment, to advise Wilhelm to give up the crown. It was only then that Emperor Wilhelm II accepted the fait accompli and agreed to give up the throne.\n\nHope of preserving the monarchy dwindled rapidly in the face of growing revolutionary unrest. With masses gathering in Berlin, Prince Maximilian unilaterally announced Wilhelm’s abdication of both crowns at noon on November 9, 1918, (which he would not officially confirm until November 28) as well as the renunciation of Crown Prince Wilhelm.\n\nThe proclamation, written by Theodor Lewald, the Under Secretary of State at the Imperial Home Office, read:\n\n“His Majesty the Emperor and King has made the decision to renounce to the throne.\n\nThe Imperial Chancellor shall remain in office only until the matters related to the abdication of the Emperor, the renunciation of His Imperial and Royal Highness the Crown Prince to the thrones of the German Empire and of Prussia, and the establishment of the regency have been settled.\n\nHe intends to propose to the Regent the appointment of Deputy Ebert as Imperial Chancellor and the introduction of a bill for the election by universal suffrage of a constituent German national assembly, on which it would fall to determine the future definitive form of government of the German people, inclusive of the populations who should wish to request their entry into the Reich.\n\nBerlin, 9 November 1918.\n\nThe Imperial Chancellor, Prince Max von Baden.”\n\nThere was a final mention which referred to the potential reunion of German-Austria to the rest of Germany, following the dissolution of the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nMaximilian himself was forced to resign later the same day when it became clear that only Friedrich Ebert could effectively exert control.\n\nMSDP co-chairman Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the new “German Republic” from the Reichstag building to gathered crowds, while two hours thereafter Spartacist leader Karl Liebknecht proclaimed the “Free Socialist Republic of Germany” at the Berlin Palace.\n\nNeither proclamation of a Republic was constitutional, and the political situation remained chaotic for several more months, with a short Civil War between radical leftist revolutionaries and the more moderate post-imperial social democrat government that would emerge victorious and form the Weimar Republic.\n\nOn November 9th, Emperor Wilhelm II boarded a train and went into exile in the Netherlands, which had remained neutral throughout the war.\n\nNevertheless, the proclamations and Wilhelm II’s abdication triggered a powerful domino effect: the same day a number of other princes stepped down, and within a week most monarchs in Germany had followed suit. The last to abdicate was King Wilhelm II of Württemberg on November 30, 1918.\n\nFollowing the abdication of Wilhelm II on November 9, 1918 and German Revolution of 1918–1919, the German nobility and royalty as legally defined classes were abolished on August 11, 1919 with the promulgation of the Weimar Constitution, under which all Germans were made equal before the law, and the legal rights and privileges, and all following German Houses, titles, insignia and ranks of nobility were abolished.\n\nThe Emperor as Head of State held the title German Emperor (the style “Emperor of Germany” being deliberately avoided), and was simultaneously a Federal Prince as King of Prussia, the sovereign of its largest federal state. Of the princely heads of state, 4 held the title King (the Kings of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Württemberg), 6 held the title Grand Duke, 5 held the title Duke and 7 held the title Prince (i.e. Sovereign Prince, Fürst).\n\nThis is a list of German Monarchs of the Empire that abdicated in November of 1918.\n\nWilhelm II, The German Emperor, King of Prussia\n\nKing Ludwig III of Bavaria\n\nKing Friedrich August III of Saxony\n\nKing Wilhelm II of Württemberg\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich II of Baden\n\nGrand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and By Rhine\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin*\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich August II of Holstein-Gottorp\n\nGrand Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nDuke Joachim Ernst of Anhalt\n\nDuke Ernst August of Brunswick\n\nDuke Ernst II of Saxe-Altenburg\n\nDuke Charles Eduard of Saxe-Gotha-Gotha\n\nDuke Bernhard III of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nPrince Leopold IV of Lippe-Biesterfeld\n\nPrince Adolph II of Schaumburg-Lippe\n\nPrince Günther of Schwarzburg\n\nPrince Friedrich of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n\nPrince Heinrich XXVII, Prince Reuss Younger Line\n\n* On February 23, 1918, Grand Duke Adolph Friedrich VI of Mecklenburg-Strelitz committed suicide, leaving his cousin Charles Michael of Mecklenburg-Strelitz as heir to the Strelitz throne. Being in Russia, however, Charles Michael did not assume the throne, and in 1918 he wrote to Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who was acting as Regent in Strelitz, stating that he wished to renounce his rights of succession to Strelitz, though the letter was only received by Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV in 1919 after the end of the German monarchies, so the issue of succession could not be resolved at the time.\n\nBoris III (January 30, 1894 – August 28, 1943) was the “Tsar” of the Kingdom of Bulgaria from 1918 until his death in 1943. Although many sources use the Title of Tsar I generally translate the title of Tsar into the title of King. Tomorrow I will do a post on why I translate the title of Tsar into the title of King.\n\nBoris was born on January 30, 1894 in Sofia to Ferdinand I, Prince of Bulgaria, and his wife Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nHis father, Ferdinand I, Prince of Bulgaria, was a German Prince of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry. He was the son of Prince August of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and his wife Clémentine of Orléans, daughter of King Louis Philippe I of the French and his wife Princess Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies.\n\nPrincess Maria Antonia Koháry was a Hungarian Noble and heiress who married Ferdinand’s grandfather, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nThe previous ruling Prince of Bulgaria, Alexander of Battenberg, had abdicated in 1886 after a pro-Russian coup, only seven years after he had been elected. Ferdinand, who was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, was elected Prince of autonomous Bulgaria by its Grand National Assembly on July 7, 1887.\n\nOn October 5, 1908, Ferdinand proclaimed Bulgaria’s de jure independence from the Ottoman Empire (though the country had been de facto independent since 1878). He also proclaimed Bulgaria a Kingdom, and assumed the title of Tsar—a deliberate nod to the rulers of the earlier Bulgarian states. However, while the title Tsar was translated as “Emperor” in the First and Second Bulgarian Empires, it was translated as “King” under Ferdinand and his successors.\n\nPrincess Marie Louise was born in Rome in 1870 the eldest daughter of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his first wife, Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The couple produced eleven more children before Maria Pia died in childbirth in 1882. Later, Duke Robert remarried Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal and had twelve more children.\n\nBoris’s mother, Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma, who was twelve at the time of her mother’s death, was brought up in Biarritz and Switzerland under the care of English governesses. Fluent in five languages, she liked painting and music. Her talents playing the guitar and the piano were judged to be well above the average.\n\nIn 1892, her father Robert I, Duke of Parma, arranged her marriage to the then reigning Prince of Bulgaria, Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The negotiations were conducted between Duke Robert and Ferdinand’s mother, Princess Clémentine of Orléans.\n\nThe engagement was celebrated at the Castle of Schwartzau, the residence of the Bourbon-Parma family in Austria. Marie Louise and Ferdinand had never met prior to that day. Princess Clémentine, who was present on that occasion, described her future daughter-in-law in a letter to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom as “Unhappily not very pretty, it is the only thing which is lacking, since she is charming, good, very witty, intelligent and very likable”.\n\nThe wedding took place on April 20, 1893 at the Villa Pianore in Lucca, Italy, the residence of Duke Roberto in Italy. Marie Louise was 23 at the time, nine years younger than Ferdinand. The couple wasted no time producing an heir, with son Boris born nine months and ten days after their wedding.\n\nConversation to Eastern Orthodoxy\n\nIn February 1896, Boris’s father paved the way for the reconciliation of Bulgaria and Russia with the conversion of the infant Prince Boris from Roman Catholicism to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, a move that earned Ferdinand the frustration of his wife, the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives (particularly his uncle Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary) and excommunication from the Catholic Church by Pope Leo XIII.\n\nIn order to remedy this difficult situation, Ferdinand christened all his remaining children as Catholics. Emperor Nicholas II of Russia stood as godfather to Boris and met the young boy during Ferdinand’s official visit to Saint Petersburg in July 1898.\n\nAs the eldest son of King Ferdinand I, Boris assumed the throne upon the abdication of his father on October 3, 1918 in the wake of Bulgaria’s defeat in World War I. Under the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly, Bulgaria was forced to, amongst other things, cede various territories, pay crippling war reparations, and greatly reduce the size of its military.\n\nThat same year, Aleksandar Stamboliyski of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union became prime minister. After Stamboliyski was overthrown in a coup in 1923, Boris recognized the new government of Aleksandar Tsankov, who harshly suppressed the Bulgarian Communist Party and led the nation through a brief border war with Greece.\n\nTsankov was removed from power in 1926, and a series of Prime Ministersvfollowed until 1934, when the corporatist Zveno movement staged a coup and outlawed all political parties. Boris opposed the Zveno government and overthrew them in 1935, eventually installing Georgi Kyoseivanov as Prime Minister. For the remainder of his reign, Boris would rule as a de facto absolute monarch, with his Prime Ministers largely submitting to his will.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War II, Bulgaria initially remained neutral. In 1940, Bogdan Filov replaced Kyoseivanov as prime minister, becoming the last Prime Minister to serve under Boris. In September 1940, with the support of Nazi Germany, Bulgaria received the region of Southern Dobrudja from Romania as part of the Treaty of Craiova.\n\nIn January 1941, Boris approved the anti-Semitic Law for Protection of the Nation, which denied citizenship to Bulgarian Jews and placed numerous restrictions upon them. In March 1941, Bulgaria joined the Axis and allowed German troops to use Bulgaria as a base from which to invade Yugoslavia and Greece.\n\nUnder public pressure Boris cancelled the deportation of Bulgarian Jews while expelling almost 20,000 Jews to the Bulgarian countryside to be deployed in forced-labor camps. In 1942, Zveno, the Agrarian National Union, the Bulgarian Communist Party, and various other far-left groups united to form a resistance movement known as the Fatherland Front, which would later go on to overthrow the government in 1944. In August 1943, shortly after returning from a visit to Germany, Boris died at the age of 49. His six-year-old son, Simeon II, succeeded him as King.\n\nMarriage\n\nBoris married princess Giovanna of Italy, daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Princess Elena of Montenegro. Upon her Roman Catholic christening, she was given the names Giovanna Elisabetta Antonia Romana Maria. Her older brother was the future (and last) Italian king Umberto II of Italy.\n\nBoris and Giovanna married in a Catholic ceremony – but not a Mass – at the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi in Assisi, Italy, on October 25, 1930. Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini registered the marriage at the town hall immediately after the religious service.\n\nTheir marriage produced two children: a daughter, Maria Louisa, on 13 January 13, 1932, and a son and heir to the throne, Simeon, on June 16, 1937.\n\nChristian X (September 26, 1870 – April 20, 1947) was King of Denmark from 1912 to his death in 1947, and the only King of Iceland as Kristján X, in the form of a personal union rather than a political union between 1918 and 1944.\n\nChristian was born on September 26, 1870 at his parents’ country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located on the shores of the Øresund Strait 10 kilometers north of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand in Denmark, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX.\n\nChristian was the first child of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Carl XV of Sweden and Norway and Louise of the Netherlands.\n\nHe was a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sondenburg-Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg, and the first monarch since King Frederik VII born into the Danish royal family; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from Schleswig.\n\nAmong his siblings was King Haakon VII of Norway. His son became Frederik IX of Denmark. Among his cousins were King George V of the United Kingdom, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and King Constantine I of Greece, while Queen Maud of Norway, was both his cousin and sister-in-law.\n\nAs a young man, Prince Christian fell in love with the French Princess Marguerite of Orléans, who was the younger sister of his uncle Prince Valdemar’s wife Princess Marie of Orléans.\n\nPrincess Marguerite of Orléans (1869 – 1940) was a member of the House of Orléans, daughter of Prince Robert d’Orléans, Duke of Chartres and Princess Françoise d’Orléans. She bore the courtesy title of Princess of Orleans. Both of her parents were grandchildren of the French King, Louis Philippe I of France.\n\nPrince Christian’s feelings, however, were not reciprocated, and after a few years of unhappy infatuation, she married in 1896 Marie Armand Patrice de Mac Mahon, 2nd Duke of Magenta, son of the French Marshal and President Patrice de MacMahon.\n\nChristian married Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Cannes on 26 April 1898; she was a daughter of Friedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, the only daughter and second child of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia and his wife Princess Cecilie of Baden. Paternally, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine had a sister, Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, (1886 – 1954), who married Prince Wilhelm of Prussia German Crown Prince the eldest son and child of the eldest child of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia and his wife Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, and thus a great-grandson of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. As Emperor Wilhelm’s heir, he was the last Crown Prince of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, until the abolition of the monarchy.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine eventually became his queen consort. They had two sons:\n\n1. Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark\n\n2. Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark\n\nThe couple were given Christian VIII’s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as their residence and Sorgenfri Palace north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen.\n\nOn May 14, 1912, King Frederik VIII died at the age of 68 after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking an evening walk in Hamburg, Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in Nice, France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to Copenhagen.\n\nPrince Christian was in Copenhagen when he heard about his father’s demise and succeeded to the throne at the age of 41. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christian VII’s Palace at Amalienborg by the Prime Minister Klaus Berntsen as King Christian X.\n\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the Easter Crisis of 1920, in which he dismissed the democratically elected Social Liberal cabinet with which he disagreed, and installed one of his own choosing.\n\nThis action was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of parliamentarianism had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901.\n\nFaced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the Social Democrats and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic head of state.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Denmark, Christian became a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards.\n\nWith a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times. King Christian X was known to parade through town on his horse, Jubilee.\n\nDeath\n\nOn his death in Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was interred along with other members of the Danish royal family in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the Danish resistance movement was placed on his coffin under a castrum doloris.\n\nKing Christian X of Denmark was succeeded by his eldest son Prince Frederik who became King Frederik IX of Denmark.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (November 18, 1856 – January 5, 1929) was a Russian general in World War I (1914–1918).\n\nFamily\n\nA very tall man (1.98m / 6′ 6″), Grand Duke Nicholas, named after his paternal grandfather, the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, was born as the eldest son to Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich of Russia (1831–1891) and Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg (1838–1900) onNovember 18, 1856.\n\nHis father was the sixth child and third son born to Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and his Empress Consort Alexandra Fedorovna (1798–1860). Alexandra Fedorovna was born Princess Charlotte of Prussia the daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nNicholas’s mother, Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg, his father’s first cousin’s daughter, was a daughter of Duke Constantine Peter of Oldenburg (1812–1881) and Princess Therese of Nassau (1815–1871).\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Duke Peter of Oldenburg, was a son of Duke George of Oldenburg and Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Paul I of Russia and Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\nSophie Dorothea of Württemberg was a daughter of Duke Friedrich Eugene of Württemberg and Princess Friederike of Brandenburg-Schwedt.\n\nAfter Grand Duke Paul (the future Emperor Paul I of Russia) became a widower in 1776, King Friedrich II of Prussia (Sophie Dorothea’s maternal great-uncle) and Empress Catherine II of Russia chose Sophie Dorothea as the ideal candidate to become Paul’s second wife.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas was the first cousin once removed of Emperor Nicholas II. To distinguish between them, the Grand Duke was often known within the Imperial family as “Nikolasha”: the Grand Duke was also known as “Nicholas the Tall” while the Emperor was “Nicholas the Short”.\n\nOn April 29, 1907, Grand Duke Nicholas married Princess Anastasia of Montenegro (1869–1935), the daughter of King Nicholas I, and sister of Princess Milica, who had married Nicholas’s brother, Grand Duke Peter. They had no children. She had previously been married to George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg, by whom she had two children, until their divorce in 1906. Since the Montenegrins were a fiercely Slavic, anti-Ottoman people from the Balkans, Anastasia reinforced the Pan-Slavic tendencies of Nicholas.\n\nRevolution\n\nThe February Revolution found Nicholas in the Caucasus. He was appointed by the Emperor, in his last official act, as the supreme commander in chief, and was wildly received as he journeyed to headquarters in Mogilev; however, within 24 hours of his arrival, the new Prime Minister, Prince Georgy Lvov, cancelled his appointment.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas spent the next two years in Crimea, sometimes under house arrest, taking little part in politics. There appears to have been some sentiment to have him head the White Army forces active in southern Russia at the time, but the leaders in charge, especially General Anton Denikin, were afraid that a strong monarchist figurehead would alienate the more left leaning constituents of the movement. He and his wife escaped just ahead of the Red Army in April 1919, aboard the British Royal Navy battleship HMS Marlborough.\n\nOn August 8, 1922, Grand Duke Nicholas was proclaimed as Nicholas III, Emperor of all the Russias by the Zemsky Sobor of the Priamurye region in the Far East by White Army general Mikhail Diterikhs. Nicholas was already living abroad and consequently was not present. Two months later the Priamurye region fell to the Bolsheviks.\n\nIn exile\n\nAfter a stay in Genoa as a guest of his brother-in-law, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, Grand Duke Nicholas and his wife took up residence in a small chateau at Choigny, 20 miles outside of Paris. He was under the protection of the French secret police as well as by a small number of faithful Cossack retainers.\n\nHe became the symbolic figurehead of an anti-Soviet Russian monarchist movement, after assuming on November 16, 1924 the supreme command of all Russian forces in exile and thus of the Russian All-Military Union, which had been founded in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by Gen Pyotr Wrangel two months prior.\n\nThe monarchists made plans to send agents into Russia. Conversely a top priority of the Soviet secret police was to penetrate this monarchist organization and to kidnap Grand Duke Nicholas.\n\nThey were successful in the former, infiltrating the group with spies (OGPU later lured the anti-Bolshevik British master spy Sidney Reilly back to the Soviet Union (1925) where he was killed). They did not succeed however, in kidnapping Grand Duke Nicholas. As late as June 1927, the monarchists were able to set off a bomb at the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas died on January 5, 1929 of natural causes on the French Riviera, where he had gone to escape the rigors of winter. He was originally buried in the church of St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cannes, France.\n\nIn 2014 Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia (1922–2014) and Prince Dimitri Romanov (1926–2016) requested the transfer of his remains. The bodies of Nicholas Nikolaevich and his wife were re-buried in Moscow at the World War I memorial military cemetery in May 2015.\n\nOn March 2, 1917, because of the hardships Russia suffered during World War I, public support for Emperor Nicholas II had collapsed and he was forced to abdicate the throne.\n\nEmperor Nicholas first abdicated in favor of his eldest son and heir Tsarivich Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile.\n\nNicholas, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, Grand Duke Michael, as the next Emperor of all the Russias. He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government.\n\nBy early morning, Michael was proclaimed as “Emperor Michael II of All the Russia’s” to Russian troops and in cities throughout Russia, but his accession was not universally welcomed. While some units cheered and swore allegiance to the new emperor, others remained indifferent.\n\nThe newly formed Provisional Government had not agreed to Michael’s succession. When Michael awoke that morning, he discovered not only that his brother had abdicated in his favour, as Nicholas had not informed him previously, but also that a delegation from the Duma would visit him in a few hours’ time.\n\nThe meeting with Duma President Rodzianko, the new Prime Minister Prince Lvov and other ministers, including Pavel Milyukov and Alexander Kerensky, lasted all morning. Putyatina laid on a lunch, and in the afternoon two lawyers (Baron Nolde and Vladimir Nabokov) were called to the apartment to draft a manifesto for Michael to sign.\n\nThe legal position was complicated, as the legitimacy of the government, whether Nicholas had the right to remove his son from the succession, and whether Michael actually was emperor, were all open to question.\n\nGrand Duke Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic.\n\nThe hopes of the monarchists that Michael might be able to assume the throne following the election of the Constituent Assembly were overtaken by events. The Provisional Government had little effective power; real power was held by the Petrograd Soviet.\n\nThe abdication of Nicholas II and Michael’s deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty’s rule to an end.\n\nOn August 21, 1917, guards surrounded the villa on Nikolaevskaya street where Grand Duke Michael was living with Natalia. On the orders of Kerensky, they were both under house arrest, along with Nicholas Johnson, who had been Michael’s secretary since December 1912.\n\nOn September 1, 1917, Kerensky declared Russia a republic. Michael wrote in his diary: “We woke up this morning to hear Russia declared a Republic. What does it matter which form the government will be as long as there is order and justice?” Two weeks later, Michael’s house arrest was lifted.\n\nAfter the abdication Emperor Nicholas II ad on March 20, 1917, the Provisional Government decreed that the royal family should be held under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.\n\nThe Provisional Government desired to send the Imperial Family into exile abroad. However, after his cousin King George V of the United Kingdom withdrew an earlier offer of asylum in the United Kingdom and the rejection of offers of asylum from other countries the Provisional Government sent them in exile to Siberia until it was decided where they could permanently relocate.\n\nThe Provisional Government feared that disturbances in the city could easily reach Tsarskoye Selo and it was decided to move the Imperial Family to a safer location. Alexander Kerensky, who had taken over as prime minister, selected the town of Tobolsk in Western Siberia, since it was remote from any large city and 150 miles (240 km) from the nearest rail station.\n\nBy October the Provisional Government fell and the Soviet Bolshevik Government under Vladimir Lenin took control of the Imperial Family and they had no desire to have them freed to leave Russia for exile in another country. Lenin’s brother, Alexander, had been executed for his part in a rebellion and an assassination attempt against Emperor Alexander III. Exacting revenge was Vladimir Lenin’s plan.\n\nOn March 7, 1918,Grand Duke Michael and his secretary Johnson were re-arrested on the orders of Moisei Uritsky, the Head of the Petrograd secret police, and imprisoned at the Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute. And on March 11, 1918, Uritsky sent Michael and Johnson to Perm, a thousand miles to the east, on the order of the Council of the People’s Commissars, which included both Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.\n\nOn June 12, 1918, the leader of the local secret police, Gavril Myasnikov, with the connivance of other local Bolsheviks, hatched a plan to murder Grand Duke Michael. Myasnikov assembled a team of four men who, like him, were all former prisoners of the Emperors regime:\n\nUsing a forged order, the four men gained entry to Grand Duke Michael’s hotel at 11.45 p.m. At first, Michael refused to accompany the men until he spoke with the local chairman of the secret police, Pavel Malkov.\n\nThey drove out of the town into the forest near Motovilikha. When Grand Duke Michael queried their destination, he was told they were going to a remote railway crossing to catch a train.\n\nBy now it was the early hours of June 13. They all alighted from the carriages in the middle of the wood, and both Michael and Johnson were fired upon, once each, but as the assassins were using home-made bullets, their guns jammed.\n\nGrand Duke Michael, who may or may not have been injured, moved towards the wounded Johnson with arms outstretched, when he was shot at point-blank range in the head and killed instantly. The bodies were stripped and buried.\n\nWith counter revolutionaries sympathetic to the Emperor closing in on Tobolsk, the Council of People’s Commissar, commonly known as the Sovnarkom appointed their own commissar to take charge of Tobolsk and remove the Romanovs to Yekaterinburg, with the intention of eventually bringing Nicholas to a show trial in Moscow.\n\nOn the morning of April 30, 1918 the Imperial Family finally arrived in Yekaterinburg. They were imprisoned in the two-story Ipatiev House, the home of the military engineer Nikolay Nikolayevich Ipatiev, which ominously became referred to as the “house of special purpose”. Here the Romanovs were kept under even stricter conditions; their retinue was further reduced and their possessions were searched.\n\nIn the early hours of July 17, 1918 with counter revolutionaries closing in on Yekaterinburg, Nicholas II and the entire royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev House where they were all brutally murdered.\n\nAustria-Hungary\n\nAustria-Hungary allowed formation of a Polish quasi-government, the Supreme National Committee, and had three different ideas regarding Poland. One, the “Austro-Polish Solution”, involved the creation of a Polish kingdom under the Emperor of Austria, who, among his other titles, was already King of Galicia and Lodomeria. German and Magyar (Hungarian) elements within the Habsburg monarchy opposed such a move for fear of creating a predominantly Slavic area.\n\nUnlike Emperor Franz Joseph, however, Emperor Charles I of Austria, who had acceded to the Habsburg thrones in 1916, promoted the idea. The other two ideas involved the division of the former Congress Poland between Germany and Austria-Hungary, or between Austria-Hungary and a state built from Lithuania, Belarus and the remnants of Congress Poland to create a new version of the 1795 dissolved Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe Habsburg candidate\n\nOf the candidates for the new Polish throne, Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria (1860 – 1933) and his son Archduke Charles Albrecht (1888 – 1951) were early contenders. Both resided in the Galician town of Saybusch (now Żywiec) and spoke Polish fluently. Charles Stephen’s daughters were married to the Polish aristocrats Princes Czartoryski and Radziwiłł.\n\nArchduke Charles Stephen of Austria was born at the castle of Gross Seelowitz in Moravia (today Židlochovice near Brno in the Czech Republic), the son of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria 1818–1874, himself son of Archduke Charles of Austria, Duke of Teschen; and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1831–1903), the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nOn February 28, 1886 at Vienna, Charles Stephen married Archduchess Maria Theresia, Princess of Tuscany, she was the daughter of Archduke Charles Salvator of Austria, Prince of Tuscany and his wife Princess Maria Immaculata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The ceremony took place in the Hofburg and was witnessed by Cardinal Ganglbauer.\n\nTheir son, Archduke Charles Albrecht of Austria, was a landowner in Żywiec, a colonel of artillery in both the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Army (cavalry) and the Polish Army, and the 1,175th knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1910.\n\nIn 1918 and again in 1939 he became a volunteer in the Polish army. He fought in the Polish–Soviet War. In 1920, he commanded the Grudziądz Fortress. During the German occupation of Poland, he declared Polish nationality and refused to sign the Volksliste. He was imprisoned in November 1939, kept in Cieszyn[citation needed] and tortured by the Gestapo. His wife was interned in Wisła. He left prison blind in one eye and half-paralyzed. In October 1942, Albrecht and his family were sent to a labor camp in Strausberg. After liberation, he moved to Kraków and then to Sweden. His estate was confiscated in 1939 by the invading Germans, and again in 1945 by the Polish People’s Republic.\n\nFamily and children\n\nOn November 8, 1920 he married morganatically Alice Elisabeth Ankarcrona (born at Tullgarn, near Trosa, December 18, 1889 and died at Saltsjöbaden, near Stockholm, November 26, 1985) in the castle of Żywiec Poland. She was a daughter of Oscar Carl Gustav Ankarcrona and his wife, Anna Carleson. The head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine accorded her the hereditary title of “Princess of Altenburg” on December 15, 1949.\n\nAccording to Polish historian Janusz Pajewski “the Austrians had underestimated Germany’s desire to determine Poland’s fate”. They did recognise, according to Prime Minister Karl von Stürgkh, that “Poles will remain Poles […] even 150 years after Galicia was joined to Austria, Poles still didn’t become Austrians”.\n\nAfter Germany’s 1918 Spring Offensive had failed to win the war on the Western front, General Ludendorff in September proposed seeking peace based on the plan outlined by U.S. President Wilson in January 1918 in his Fourteen Points, which in regard to Poland demanded the creation of an “independent Polish state … guaranteed by international covenant” with “free and secure access to the sea”. On October 3, the new German Chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, announced Germany’s acceptance of Wilson’s plan and immediate disestablishment of military administration in the countries occupied by Germany.\n\nIn spite of the initial total dependence of this client state on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions in the aftermath of the Armistice of November 11, 1918 as the cornerstone proto-state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter composed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be ceded to Poland, and therefore played a crucial role in the resurrection of Polish statehood.\n\nOn November 16, 1918, Piłsudski sent a radio telegram to “Mr President of the United States, the Royal English Government, the Government of the French Republic, the Royal Italian Government, the Imperial Japanese Government, the Government of the German Republic, as well as the governments of all the warring or neutral states”, notifying them about the establishment of an independent Polish State, named in the telegram as the Polish Republic.\n\nOn November 17, both the newly designated prime minister Daszyński and the provisional government of Wróblewski resigned in favour of the new Moraczewski government, finally ending the governmental diarchy. Therefore, either November 14, or November 17, may both be considered the final day of kingdom’s existence. The transition to republican government was formally completed through the decree of November 22, 1918 on the supreme representational authority of the Polish Republic, which stipulated assumption by Piłsudski of the interim office of chief of state.\n\nThe Kingdom of Poland, also known informally as the Regency Kingdom of Poland, was a short-lived polity that was proclaimed during World War I by the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire on November 5, 1916 on the territories of the formerly Russian-ruled Congress Poland held by the Central Powers as the Government General of Warsaw and became active on January 14, 1917.\n\nThis Kingdom was to be a puppet state that was to provide a buffer both geographically and politically between the Empires of Germany and Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire. It would be the first reappearance of Poland on the map of Europe after it had been carved up to other nations.\n\nPoland had disappeared from the map of Europe with the Partitions of Poland when three partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth took place toward the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of sovereign Poland and Lithuania for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.\n\nThe First Partition was decided on August 5, 1772 after the Bar Confederation lost the war with Russia. The Second Partition occurred in the aftermath of the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Targowica Confederation of 1792 when Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth and the partition treaty was signed during the Grodno Sejm on January 23, 1793 (without Austria). The Third Partition took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish Kościuszko Uprising the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.\n\nRationale\n\nThe decision to propose the restoration of Poland after a century of partitions was taken up by the German policymakers in an attempt to legitimize further imperial presence in the occupied territories and create a buffer state to prevent future wars with Russia. The plan was followed by the German propaganda pamphlet campaign delivered to the Poles in 1915, claiming that the German soldiers were arriving as liberators to free Poland from subjugation by the Russian Empire.\n\nHowever, the German High Command under Erich Ludendorff also wanted to annex around 30,000 square kilometers of the territory of former Congress Poland, and planned to evict up to 3 million Poles and Jews to make room for German colonists in the so-called Polish Border Strip plan. The German government used punitive threats to force Polish landowners living in the German-occupied Baltic states to relocate and sell their Baltic property to the Germans in exchange for entry to Poland. Parallel efforts were made to remove Poles from Polish territories of the Prussian Partition.\n\nGermany\n\nWith onset of war in 1914, for the purposes of securing Germany’s eastern border against the Russian imperial army, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, the German chancellor, decided on the annexation of a specific strip of land from Congress Poland, known later on as the Polish Border Strip. In order to avoid adding the Polish population there to the population of imperial Germany, it was proposed that the Poles would be ethnically cleansed to a proposed new Polish state further east, while the strip would be resettled with Germans.\n\nGerman Emperor Wilhelm II conceived of creating a dependent Polish state from territory conquered from Russia. This new autonomous Kingdom of Poland would be ruled by a German prince and have its military, transportation, and economy controlled by Germany. Its army and railway network would be placed under Prussian command.\n\nIn 1913, Emperor Franz Joseph commanded Archduke Franz Ferdinand to observe the military maneuvers in Bosnia scheduled for June 1914. Following the maneuvers, Ferdinand and his wife planned to visit Sarajevo to open the state museum in its new premises there. Duchess Sophie, according to their eldest son, Duke Maximilian, accompanied her husband out of fear for his safety.\n\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated on June 28, 1914 by Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip. They were shot at close range while being driven through Sarajevo, the provincial capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina,\n\nThe assassination initiated the July Crisis, a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain. Believing Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz Ferdinand’s murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this.\n\nHowever, the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof of Serbian involvement and a dossier used to make its case was riddled with errors. On July 23, Austria delivered an ultimatum to Serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities.\n\nSerbia ordered general mobilisation on July 25, but accepted all the terms, except for those empowering Austrian representatives to suppress “subversive elements” inside Serbia, and take part in the investigation and trial of Serbians linked to the assassination. Claiming this amounted to rejection, Austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day; on July 28, they declared war on Serbia and began shelling Belgrade.\n\nHaving initiated war preparations on July 25, Russia, under Emperor Nicholas II, now ordered general mobilisation in support of Serbia on September 30th. Germany, under German Emperor Wilhelm II, promised complete support to Austria-Hungary and many vorrespondences between the Russian and German Emperors where ultimatums were delivered.\n\nOnce the final German ultimatum to Russia expired on the morning of August 1st, the two countries were at war. Later the same day, Emperor Wilhelm II was informed by his ambassador in London, Prince Lichnowsky, that Britain would remain neutral if France was not attacked, and might not intervene at all given the ongoing Home Rule Crisis in Ireland. Jubilant at this news, he ordered General Moltke, the German chief of staff, to “march the whole of the … army to the East”.\n\nThis allegedly brought Moltke to the verge of a nervous breakdown, who protested that “it cannot be done. The deployment of millions cannot be improvised.” Lichnowsky soon realised he was mistaken, although Wilhelm insisted on waiting for a telegram from his cousin George V; once received it confirmed there had been a misunderstanding, and he told Moltke, “Now do what you want.”\n\nAware of German plans to attack through Belgium, French Commander-in-Chief Joseph Joffre asked his government for permission to cross the border and pre-empt such a move. To avoid a violation of Belgian neutrality, he was told any advance could come only after a German invasion.\n\nOn August 2nd, Germany occupied Luxembourg and exchanged fire with French units; on August 3, they declared war on France and demanded free passage across Belgium, which was refused.\n\nEarly on the morning of August 4th, the Germans invaded and King Albert I of Belgium called for assistance under the Treaty of London. Britain sent Germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from Belgium; when this expired at midnight without a response, the two empires were at war.\n\nWorld War I had commenced.\n\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand’s murder on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo was the most immediate cause of World War I.\n\nI wrote extensively of his assassination on this blog on the 100th anniversary of his assassination.\n\nhttps://wp.me/p2pver-y9\n\nI now want to examine why was Archduke Franz Ferdinand targeted for assassination? The answer lies in a combination of his political views and the goals of the Black Hand, a secret military society formed in 1901 by officers in the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia.\n\nThe three cornerstones of Franz Ferdinand’s political conviction were clericalism, anti-democratic views, and anti-Hungarianism,” and the basis of his worldview was that “politics is a matter only for the ruler, while the people, the masses have to obey.” Franz Ferdinand often complained that in Hungary, the glorification of revolutionary hero Lajos Kossuth, the decline of the monarchical principle, and the dominance of the Freemasons and the Jewish people was prevalent.\n\nHistorians have disagreed on how to characterize the political philosophies of Franz Ferdinand, some attributing generally liberal views on the empire’s nationalities while others have emphasized his dynastic centralism, Catholic conservatism, and tendency to clash with other leaders.\n\nHe advocated granting greater autonomy to ethnic groups within the Empire and addressing their grievances, especially the Czechs in Bohemia and the south Slavic peoples in Croatia and Bosnia, who had been left out of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\nYet his feelings towards the Hungarians were less generous, often described as antipathy. For example, in 1904 he wrote that “The Hungarians are all rabble, regardless of whether they are minister or duke, cardinal or burgher, peasant, hussar, domestic servant, or revolutionary”, and he regarded even István Tisza as a revolutionary and “patented traitor”.\n\nHe regarded Hungarian nationalism as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Hungarian in his presence – despite the fact that it was the official regimental language. He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy’s army, the Honvédség, as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians’ failure to provide funds for the joint army and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces.\n\nHe also advocated a cautious approach towards Serbia – repeatedly locking horns with Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, Vienna’s hard-line Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, warning that harsh treatment of Serbia would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with Russia, to the ruin of both empires.\n\nIt was his desire to include ethic groups such as the Bohemia, Croatia, Bosnia in a similar pact as the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary, which was a military and diplomatic alliance of two sovereign states. The Compromise only partially re-established the former pre-1848 sovereignty and status of the Kingdom of Hungary, being separate from, and no longer subject to, the Austrian Empire.\n\nThe compromise put an end to the 18-year-long military dictatorship and absolutist rule over Hungary which Emperor Franz Joseph had instituted after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Hungary was restored. The agreement also restored the old historic constitution of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIf as Emperor, Franz Ferdinand was able to grant sovereignty to the Serbs of Bosnia this would directly conflict with the desires of the Black Hand.\n\nAt the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nA bloody coup occurred in Serbia in 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.\n\nHabsburg rule precipitated the The Bosnian Crisis, also known as the Annexation Crisis or the First Balkan Crisis, erupted on October 5, 1908 when Austria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, territories formerly within the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire but under Austro-Hungarian administration since 1878.\n\nThese factors caused the Austro-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.\n\nBlack Hand\n\nUnification or Death, popularly known as the Black Hand, was a secret military society formed in 1901 by officers in the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia. It gained a reputation for its alleged involvement in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 and for the earlier assassination of the Serbian royal couple in 1903, under the aegis of Captain Dragutin Dimitrijević (a.k.a. “Apis”).\n\nThe society formed to unite all of the territories with a South Slavic majority that was not then ruled by either Serbia or Montenegro. It took inspiration primarily from the unification of Italy in 1859–1870 but also from the unification of Germany in 1871.\n\nThe group encompassed a range of ideological outlooks, from conspiratorially-minded army officers to idealistic youths, sometimes tending towards republicanism, despite their patrons in nationalistic royal circles\n\nBy 1914, the group had hundreds of members, many of them Serbian Army officers. The goal of uniting Serb-inhabited territories was implemented by training guerilla fighters and saboteurs. The Black Hand was organized at the grassroots level in cells of three to five members, supervised by district committees and by a Central Committee in Belgrade, whose ten-member executive committee was primarily led by Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević “Apis”.\n\nIn 1914, Apis allegedly decided that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of Austria, should be assassinated, as he was trying to pacify the Serbians, with the promise of greater autonomy for Bosnia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which would prevent a revolution if he was successful. Towards that end, three young Bosnian Serbs were allegedly recruited to kill the Archduke.\n\nThe decision to kill the Archduke was initiated by Apis and not sanctioned by the full Executive Committee (if Apis was involved at all, a question that remains in dispute).\n\nThose involved probably realised that their plot would result in war between Austria and Serbia and had every reason to expect that Russia would side with Serbia. They likely did not, however, anticipate that the assassination would start the chain of events leading to World War I."
