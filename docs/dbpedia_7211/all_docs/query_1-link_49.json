She was the daughter of Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse and by Rhine, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom,(2nd daughter of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort) and thus a grand-daughter of Queen Victoria. She was given the name Alexandra Feodorovna upon being received into the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
