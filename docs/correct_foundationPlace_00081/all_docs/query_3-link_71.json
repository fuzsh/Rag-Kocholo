        "text": "In preparation for the upcoming launch of the Eclipse Dataspaces Working Group, we are proud to announce the establishment of a Category A liaison between Eclipse Foundation AISBL and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38 (Cloud Computing and Distributed Platforms).\n\nSC 38 pursues standardization in Cloud Computing and Distributed Platforms, including Foundational concepts and technologies, operational issues, and interactions among cloud computing systems and other distributed systems.\n\nA dataspace is a multi-organizational agreement and a supporting technical infrastructure enabling data sharing between two or more participants. Dataspaces are naturally distributed, hence SC 38's interest in them.\n\nThe Eclipse Foundation is home to the Eclipse Dataspace Components project (EDC). EDC is a comprehensive framework providing a basic set of features that dataspace implementations can use and customize while preserving interoperability through a well-defined API. EDC implements the Gaia-X AISBL Trust Framework and the IDSA Dataspace protocol.\n\nBy establishing this liaison, the Eclipse Foundation intends to contribute its expertise to future standardization efforts revolving around cloud computing, dataspaces, and edge computing. Existing and upcoming Eclipse specifications could eventually be transposed into standards as well."
