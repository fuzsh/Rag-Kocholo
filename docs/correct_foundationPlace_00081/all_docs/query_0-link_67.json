Ministry of Finance “The group increased net interest income by 21.5% mainly as a result of the improved net interest margins by the Namibian operations. This was offset by a decreasing net interest margin in Botswana and Zambia as a result of increased cost of funding due to liquidity pressures. Expenses “Operating expenses increased 20.6% year-on-year. This increase is mainly due to the addition of Entrepo to the group (contributing 2.4% of the growth), increase in operational banking expenses as a result of higher transaction volumes (3.9% of the growth) and staff costs, contributing to 10.1% of the growth.
