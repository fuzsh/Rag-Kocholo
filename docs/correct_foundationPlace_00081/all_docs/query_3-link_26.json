You will only be charged for what you actually use.\n\nCloud models are composed of five essential characteristics, three deployment models, and three service models.\n\n5 essential characteristics of cloud models\n\nOn-demand self-service\n\nBroad network access\n\nResource pooling\n\nRapid elasticity\n\nMeasured service\n\n3 deployment models of cloud models\n\nPublic\n\nPrivate\n\nHybrid ( combination of public & private )\n\n3 service models of cloud models\n\nInfrastructure ( aptly referred to as a Infrastructure as a service or IAAS )\n\nPlatform ( aptly referred to as a Platform as a service or PAAS )\n\nApplication ( aptly referred to as a Software as a service or SAAS )\n\n5 essential characteristics of cloud models\n\nOn-demand self-service::\n\nYou get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need using a simple interface without requiring human interaction.\n\nBroad network access::\n\nCloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tabs, laptops, etc.\n\nResource pooling::\n\nResources are dynamically assigned based on demand (make cloud cost-efficient).\n\nRapid elasticity::\n\nYou can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don’t.\n\nMeasured service::\n\nYou will only be charged for what you actually use.\n\n3 deployment models of cloud models\n\nPublic::\n\nHardware’s owned by cloud providers and used by other companies or individuals.\n\nPrivate::\n\nThe cloud infrastructure is provided for exclusive use by a single organization. it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.\n\nHybrid::\n\nMix of both public and private clouds.\n\n3 service models of cloud models\n\nInfrastructure ( IAAS )::\n\nYou get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, DB, etc ( you have to manage or operate them )\n\nPlatform ( PAAS )::\n\nYou get access to the platform that is the hardware and software ( you have to develop and deploy your applications )\n\nApplication ( SAAS )::\n\nSoftware licensing and delivery model in which software and application of centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis and sometimes also referred to as software.\n\nCloud computing is really about utilizing technologies as a service."
