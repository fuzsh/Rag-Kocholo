By bringing together industry leaders, LF Edge creates a common framework for hardware and software standards and best practices critical to sustaining current and future generations of IoT and edge devices.\n\nWe foster collaboration and innovation across multiple industries including industrial manufacturing, cities and government, energy, transportation, retail, home and building automation, automotive, industrial, logistics and health care — all of which stand to be transformed by edge computing.\n\n“\n\n\"We strongly believe that a community approach to help define a set of real-world edge use cases and capabilities integrated as blueprints, implemented with modern software stacks and cloud-native technologies, will accelerate the deployment of edge solutions with minimum friction, benefitting users and customers.\"\n\nJustin DustzadehChief Technology Officer at Equinix\n\n“\n\n\"The reason why we joined LF Edge is simple: we believe that the fastest route to innovation and success in edge computing is by working together with other companies to create universal standards that we can all build off of.\"\n\nErik NordmarkCTO and co-founder at Zededa\n\n“\n\n\"The top benefits of being a part of LF Edge include having direct connection with customers that keep me updated on the latest trends of edge computing and collaboration among end to end ecosystems and supply chain as well as validation in CI/CD environments.\"\n\nTina TsouDirector, Infrastructure Ecosystem at Arm"
