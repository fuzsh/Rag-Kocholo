Executive Summary The following undergraduate portfolio is a representation of the skills I have gained pursuing my Bachelor of Communication in Public Relations from Mount Royal University, work as the in-store marketing and social media coordinator at Earls Restaurant, my two internships with the Calgary Foundation and the charitable arm of the Calgary Flames Hockey Club, the Flames Foundation for Life. This portfolio is divided into four parts: published work, pieces of work from my internships, work I have produced for public relations classes and social media samples from my previous role at Earls Restaurant. The second part of this portfolio highlights my internships with the Calgary Foundation as the organization’s communications intern and my role as the coordinator intern for community investment and charitable foundations for the Calgary Flames Hockey Club. These experiences allowed me to grow my skills immensely in the areas of publication writing, social media, event planning, high-level editing and media relations that are illustrated in the following pages. The third section of this portfolio presents finished products from three years of public relations studies at Mount Royal University. Through my education I have gained skills in writing press releases, feature articles, and comprehensive communication plans. A variety of project samples that were completed for class assignments are present, including a social media strategy created for Pacekids Society that is being used today by the organization and a volunteer and recruitment strategy for the Literacy for Life Foundation, also being utilized today. The last section contains a poster that summarizes my undergraduate thesis on community investment in professional sports. The fourth section of my portfolio showcases the marketing work I have done as the in-store marketing and social media manager at Earls 16th Avenue, including screenshots of social media work and graphic design examples that I have produced using InDesign. This section is a small representation of my marketing skills through the Earls 16th Avenue Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages. I was solely responsible for each of these corporate social media accounts and routinely create with innovative content. The“graphic design”section illustrates two posters created with Adobe InDesign as visual marketing collateral for the restaurant. This portfolio embodies my experiences throughout my undergraduate career, my internships and the specialized communications skills I have gained along the way. I am passionate about the public relations industry and look forward to gaining new knowledge in the field and contributing my abilities to communications efforts.\n\n4.

Project Background The Vital Signs report is a citizen survey conducted annually by The Calgary Foundation that assigns grades to seven areas critical to quality of life in Calgary – living standards, populations, environment, education, arts, citizen engagement and wellness. Published as an insert in the Calgary Herald in October, the survey measures the overall vitality of the city, indicates current and emerging issues in the community and profiles nonprofit organizations that are striving to make a difference. The report reaches over 70,000 Calgarians through the Calgary Herald. Partners To produce and publish the report The Foundation partners with a research firm, The Praxis Group, to administer the survey and to collect, synthesize and determine common themes to be published in the report. An external research consultant is also hired to identify common trends and current statistics such as poverty, housing and safety. Juice creative inc. is the creative partner for the survey that produces and publishes the report. My Role For the Vital Signs report I was involved in research synthesis, editing and writing. My main role for this project was acting as the communications liaison for the Vital Signs photo shoot on August 5 – coordinating and confirming representatives from seven different charities to attend, creating call sheets and helping run the photo shoot in collaboration with my supervisor and Juice creative. I wrote and drafted descriptive pieces to be used in the report profiling each charity and assisted in the editing of other written materials. I prepared research documents for each team meeting to narrow down statistics and figures to be used in the report. I also played a large role in promoting the Vital Signs survey on Twitter, where I engaged many citizens, local nonprofit organizations and influencial Twitter personalities like Mayor Nenshi to retweet and spread the word. I also created a model release form to gain consent from all photoshoot participants for legal reasons. Published Work Calgary’s 2014 Vital Signs Report, The Calgary Foundation\n\n6.

Published Work Fall 2014 Spur Magazine Issue Editorial, The Calgary Foundation As I reflect on summer and fall this year in the city, I remember the vibrant festivals and all the citizens hitting the street to join in the fun. These past months have been such a great example of what it means to come together as a community. That is the encompassing purpose of The Calgary Foundation – a gathering place for community connections to grow. The Calgary Foundation is a collection of thousands of unique people and organizations who share the vision of a vibrant, healthy city. The following pages take a look at these individuals, organizations and groups of thoughtful citizens taking leadership to make that vision happen. Throughout this issue you will see local business owners who generously gave to The Foundation’s Flood Fund, profiled in the “Next Generation” section. Inspiring stories of The Foundation’s donors, volunteers and board members that all strive to enrich our city and the surrounding areas in unique ways. We are privileged at The Foundation to have board members like Walter Hossli – former executive director of Momentum and long-­‐standing donors and inspirational leaders like Lou MacEachern. We are always looking for opportunities to discuss bold, innovative ways to move forward in addressing the emerging needs of our community. In this issue you will find organizations doing just that – engaging in social enterprise as a new and innovative form of fund-­‐raising. These stories of cutting edge philanthropy include organizations like Kids Cancer Care Foundation of Alberta and Camp Kindle that the organization publically rents, helping fund the organization. The Calgary Progressive Lifestyles Foundation launched their Cookies on the Go program, a bakery that employs clients and helps fund their unique programs empowering adults with disabilities. Supporting influential projects, groups and people is what we’re all about at The Calgary Foundation – captured through unique stories of impact in this fourth issue of Spur. As this memorable summer comes to an end I am excited to see the great people of our city inspire change and remarkable projects set in motion. I hope you enjoy the fourth issue of Spur magazine and find the stories of the people and organizations that make our city a better place as inspiring as I do.

MRU graduate returns to receive award October 5, 2012 Emily Nachtigall Guest Columnist On Sept. 20, I, along with other students, faculty and staff, got the honour of hearing Colleen Abdoulah speak about her time at Mount Royal and her life journeys that have made her a successful business woman and inspiring role model. Abdoulah is the CEO of a major cable company called Wide Open West (WOW) and the only female CEO to lead a top five-cable company. She was in town to receive a Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award at MRU’s annual Legacy Awards. She is an inspirational speaker and storyteller who keeps you hanging on to her every word. Instead of the traditional dry speech followed by questions from the audience, Abdoulah had us howling in our chairs as she told us her adventures from growing up in small town Saskatchewan to how she has become an accomplished business woman. She explained how having a passion ignites your road to success, even if you have to try out a few different projects along the way to find it. “You might not find your passion right away, but you will find it eventually,”she said. Abdoulah channels her passion into both her career and charitable causes that are close to her heart. Working for her family’s restaurant, Abdoulah said she learned how to work hard from a young age. Abdoulah was then promoted to the project manager for the grand opening of Calaway Park after telling the CEO of the company how she would run the campaign in a board meeting in front of the whole company. “I guess I struggle with boundaries,”she joked while telling the story,“I’ve since seen a therapist.” The company’s manager gave her the job on the spot despite her young age and lack of experience due to her passion and drive for the theme park. Abdoulah also channels her passion into helping others whenever she can, donating thirty per cent of her own income annually to charity. Helping others who are less fortunate is a value she said her family modeled for her and one she holds on to today. At a relatively young age, Abdoulah moved to the states to pursue her career path. Although she has since resided in the states, adopting a daughter who she has raised there, she still considers herself a Canadian at heart. “It is part of me, my soul,”Abdoulah said.“I love the Canadian people, my family history and the memories, the beauty of the country, the pace and size of the population. I try to get back at least once a year.” When asked what advice she would give to Mount Royal students, she replied that students should take any opportunity you can get in the workforce, and to have faith in yourself in the process. “It is all about enjoying the moment you are in; being good to others no matter what, because life is short and things can be circular,”she said. “What you give comes back to you. I believe that. I have learned we are not what we do – we are much more than that. We cannot lose ourselves in our work.” The Reflector, Mount Royal University - Feature Article Published Work\n\n12.

The Rotary Club of Calgary - Newsletter Insert Published Work Rotary Ignites The Rotary Club of Calgary has an incredible story to share with Calgarians. We want to tell it in a way that reflects what Rotary stands for, how we’re different and why it matters to inspire current and potential members to enjoy another 100 years of fellowship and service. What In 2011, Rotary International embarked on a multiyear initiative to strengthen the Rotary image to motivate, engage, and inspire current and prospective members, donors, partners and staff. Following in Rotary International’s footsteps, The Rotary Club of Calgary, Downtown Club has launched Rotary Ignites to tell our story in a compelling way that positions the club as the top service club in Calgary that inspires membership and confidence from the community. Why According to the 2014 membership statistics report, membership numbers have dropped by 49 members since 2011. And demographics reveal that almost half of members are over 65 and have served for over 20 years. Rotary Ignites will provide a strategy to engage, retain and recruit members to the club. Who A committee of experienced Rotarians from the Downtown Club chaired by Paul McIntyre Royston, communications director, will determine the best firm to help the club implement Rotary Ignites. How Three local firms have been chosen to present to the Rotary Ignites committee based on their extensive marketing and communications experience with clients working for both the corporate and non-­‐profit sectors. When By the end of May the Rotary Ignites committee will submit a recommendation to the board for final approval. “Service Above Self”\n\n14.

Community Knowledge Centre The Calgary Foundation recently launched a website called the Community Knowledge Centre (CKC) – an online portal that showcases local charity profiles to inform, inspire and connect citizens, donors, media and policy makers to the needs in the community. All local registered charitable organizations are welcome to create a profile on the CKC website and to attend a story telling workshop free of charge. The Calgary Foundation hosts specialized story-telling workshops to help organizations tell their stories in an authentic and inspiring way. Event Planning, Outreach & Recruitment Throughout my internship I had the ongoing responsibility of organizing past workshop rsvp lists for The Foundation’s records and handling the workshop registration for the September 23 workshop on the event website, Eventbrite. I also worked on an outreach and recruitment project to encourage more local charities to attend the upcoming workshop which required continuous cross-referencing of previous rsvp lists while engaging new audiences. This project has included utilizing The Foundation’s various granting contact lists and sending email invitations to the upcoming workshop. Workshop Advisor I acted as a workshop advisor at the May 29 workshop, helping local charity representatives better tell their organizations’stories through writing exercises and editing. Research & Evaluation Research of the effectiveness of the CKC workshops was also a part of my role. I compiled survey responses given to participants after the May 29 workshop, picking out common themes and the percentage of respondents who thought the workshop was helpful. I combined social media feedback into this piece along with the numerical values of how many people attended and signed up for CKC following the workshop.

Working at the Calgary Dream Centre as the organization’s corporate development manager, Christopher gives back to the Calgary community by helping transform the lives of men facing addiction and other life obstacles. The Calgary Dream Centre provides recovery programs, life skill training and other supportive services to help integrate disadvantaged men back into their communities. In the wake of the Southern Alberta floods last June, Christopher stepped up as a community hero by facilitating $55,000 in donations that the Calgary Dream Centre received directly to individuals displaced by the flood on the Siksika reserve, Calgary and High River. The Calgary Dream Centre quickly became a gathering place for volunteers, where Christopher and his team connected over 1,000 volunteers to help clear debris for thousands of Calgarians impacted by the disaster. Christopher is a true example of how the contributions of passion and generosity have lasting positive impacts on Canadian communities.

Social Media One of my main roles during my internship was social media management of The Foundation’s Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. I was responsible for generating content, researching nonprofit news and engaging with The Foundation’s followers on a daily basis. Key messaging was a large role in managing the social media platforms by constructing tweets for The Foundations different audiences including donors, media, citizens, partners and grant recipients. Social media is a voice for The Foundation to engage with their publics and a way to be viewed as a thought leader in the philanthropic community. Twitter Used to engage in two-way conversations with key publics including media, thought leaders and citizens. Facebook Used for longer key messages including news articles, reports, and updates on The Foundation’s initiatives. LinkedIn LinkedIn was created in late July, 2014 as an outlet for The Foundation to attract future employees and connect to a larger audience. The Calgary Foundation Social Media Management\n\n33.

NHL Foundation Letter Nomination of Mark Giordano for 2015 NHL Foundation Award To Whom It May Concern, Over the past two years, I have had the privilege of working with Mark Giordano. Mark has always been an exceptional hockey player, inspirational teammate, and most importantly, an ambassador of his community. Mark is a proven leader both on and off the ice. Taking the Flames through a major transition period, he has shown the power of true leadership and set the bar high for the team’s community presence. Mark embodies everything it means to be a community ambassador through the launch of his own charitable program and his continued involvement with the Flames charitable arm, The Flames Foundation for Life. In the last few years Mark has achieved greatness in his hockey career. He continues to lead the team to success, not only through his guidance, but also through his individual performance. One of the greatest aspects of Mark’s character is how dedicated he has remained to investing in causes he believes in to help strengthen his community. Prior to the 2014/15 season, Mark and his wife Lauren created the Team Giordano program in partnership with the Calgary Board of Education to mentor, inspire and educate students based on principles that he believes are the keys to success in all walks of life. Donating funding to three Calgary schools, this program provides new gym equipment, computers, and a mentorship program ran by Mark and Lauren to be available for all students. In 2011, Mark launched the 5-­‐for-­‐5 program through Habitat for Humanity. Mark and Lauren act as spokespeople for the organization, and consistently donate funds that are matched by the Flames Foundation for Life. The 5-­‐for-­‐5 program aimed to build five homes for Habitat for Humanity, one in Calgary, and four in Africa and Asia. Giordano’s modest style of leadership has acted as an undercurrent for the Calgary Flames as a whole, encouraging each player to contribute to the team and to give back to the community they call home. He is always quick to credit his teammates for his successes and to stress the importance of teamwork any chance he gets. It is with great pride that I recommend Mark for the 2014/15 NHL Foundation Player Award. Without a doubt, Mark consistently demonstrates perseverance, dedication and teamwork required by the game both on the ice and in his own life. Mark`s unwavering commitment to his team, launch of his own charitable program and support of the Flames Foundation for Life all combine to make him worthy of this award as an ambassador of the Calgary community. Sincerely, Brian Burke President of Hockey Operations Calgary Flames Hockey Club\n\n52. Bachelor of Communication Communications Plans Event Plan News Releases Graphic Design Public Relations Student\n\n53. Communication Plans\n\n54. Literacy for Life Foundation Community Service Learning Project, September-December 2014 Strategic Communications Plan Volunteer Recruitment & Attainment COMM 4860 - 001 Lisa Copeland, Alyssa Briggs, Trent Warner, Emily Nachtigall Prepared for: Allison MacKenzieDecember 2014\n\n55. The following is a strategic communications plan targeted toward the recruitment and retention of volunteers at the Literacy for Life Foundation. Literacy for Life is a non-profit, charitable organization that seeks to improve literacy rates across the M.D. of Foothills. This plan was commissioned to provide an analysis of Literacy for Life’s current communications environment and give insight into what the organization can do to become a leader in volunteerism. Research conducted draws attention to Literacy for Life’s current demographic, environment, communications practice, implications and issues. This has allowed for thoughtful selection of appropriate communications strategies to help successfully manage issues, and achieve goals and objectives. The goals of this strategic plan are to increase volunteer recruitment and retention in the coming year, leading toward a large volunteer database for Literacy For Life’s major 2015 event, the Grate Grown-up Spelling Bee. The strategy and approach used for Literacy for Life’s recruitment and retention campaign provides a solid framework for the specific tactics employed to execute the campaign, and will help to make the campaign successful. Literacy for Life’s recruitment and retention campaign will use both proactive public relations strategies from Smith (2013) and best practices for v olunteer recruitment taken from two award-winning CPRS case studies dealing with volunteer recruitment. Moving forward, this triangulated approach will use specific communications tactics to successfully execute the strategies outlines above. Key messages have been composed and written to appeal to the interests of both potential and current volunteers. These key messages are worded in a way that will resonate with the target audience, and encourage them to participate in this rewarding volunteer experience. These messages have also incorporated the idea of skill-based volunteerism, giving the target audience confidence in the idea that they will be completing work that they are passionate about. After carefully selecting the communications approach and message strategies, five key tactics have been selected to help the organization reach its goals and objectives. These tactics include the creation of volunteer handouts outlining the benefits of volunteerism within Literacy for Life, school outreach programs, a promotional video, heightened attention toward traditional media focus, and an improved volunteer advertisement for community databases. These tactics are meant to move the organization to action, and are paired with a schedule of implementation and budget. Lastly, this strategic plan will outline the means by which the results will be evaluated. This will allow for current perceptions to be measured, via specific outputs and outcomes. Evaluation methods will allow for the organization to analyze the extent to which goals and objectives have been met regarding volunteer retention and recruitment for the 2015 season.\n\n56. Environmental Analysis The third area researched included an in-depth analysis of the internal and external environment at LFLF. LFLF’s strengths and weaknesses were determined by looking at information gathered from meetings with staff at the organization, as well as researching other non-profit organizations in the area. The internal analysis showed that LFLF has a small working team, which is challenging because staff have many duties and cannot commit wholly to the communications function. Although LFLF has a small working team, the organization is able to thrive due to a variety of skills and backgrounds. LFLF has a board of governance, which includes a member with a communications background. The external analysis showed that LFLF faces both strengths and weaknesses result- ed from the organization being located in a small town. The strengths include being able to use word-of-mouth as an effective form of communication. The weaknesses include having a large amount of competition for volunteers in the community. An analysis of current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) facing Literacy for Life was completed. For a detailed explanation regarding this analysis, please refer to appendix D.\n\n57. As a result of research regarding target audience, current communication collateral, the environment, trends in volunteerism, strategy and case study analysis, these following recommendations are suggested to position LFLF as a leader in volunteerism within the M.D. of Foothills: • Involve community members in all aspects of the organization • Use word-of-mouth and interpersonal communication to communicate with the community • Utilize existing volunteers to recruit new volunteers from their personal networks • Create events where LFLF can interact with community members and they can be introduced to the organization • Create opportunities for community members to trial LFLF’s services • Utilize physical volunteer sign-up forms at community events and gatherings • Interact with the community on social media and limit social media to two outlets • Survey current volunteers to determine areas for improvement and volunteer motivations • Leverage existing local media partnerships • Create unique content for media to increase LFLF’s messaging Current Volunteers • Current volunteers have had a positive experience with the organization and its staff, but are ready to move on to other experiences or are looking to downgrade their time commitments with the organization. In recommending others to volunteer, they see Literacy for Life’s continued success and help it achieve sustainability while minimizing their personal commitment. Potential Volunteers • Literacy for Life provides volunteers with ongoing training, intergenerational opportunities and flexibility while also providing them with the joy of giving back to the community.\n\n58. Task Management Goal: To develop a tailored volunteer experience that increases the recruitment of volunteers. Objectives • Awareness – To have an effect on the awareness of LFLF as providing a rewarding volunteer experience. Specifically, to maximize comprehension around the benefits of volunteering with potential volunteers from 45 to 60 per cent by January of 2015. • Acceptance – To have an effect on the acceptance that LFLF provides rewarding volunteer experiences. Specifically to increase acceptance with potential volunteers from 30 to 40 per cent from January to April 2015. • Action – To have an effect on the action of potential volunteers in the M.D. of Foothills. Specifically, to increase the number of volunteers with LFLF from 15 to 25 people from April to July 2015. Relationship Goal: To create an immersive and rewarding volunteer experience that retains existing volunteers. Objectives • Awareness – To have an effect on the awareness of the impact that volunteerism at LFLF has on the community. Specifically, to generate awareness with current volunteers from 75 to 85 per cent by January of 2015. • Acceptance – To have an effect on the acceptance of LFLF as a leader in volunteer opportunities. Specifically, to reinforce attitudes with current volunteers about the positive experience provided from 20 to 28 per cent from January to April 2015. • Action – To have an effect on the action of current volunteers to volunteer with LFLF again in 2015. Specifically, to retain 50 per cent of the current volunteer database by July 2015. A positioning statement allows for an organization to seperate itself from competitors. In addition to specific key messaging, a positioning statement should be implemented into the communications material to showcase LFLF’s competitive edge as a non-profit deserving of volunteers. The positioning statement is as follows: LFLF offers a wide range of meaningful volunteer opportunities to community members in the M.D. of Foothills.\n\n59. To effectively recruit and retain volunteers, strategic messaging must be implemented into LFLF’s communication materials. Using processes from Smith, heuristics, and case studies, specific messaging is recommended to motivate volunteer action. Two specific audiences have been identified as the main stakeholders in retaining and recruiting volunteers. This includes both potential and current volunteers. Key Messaging Current Volunteers: 1. Your volunteerism has made a difference in the community, and your skills have directly impacted those who are working to improve their literacy. Proof Points: • The 2014 Grate Groan Up Spelling Bee raised over $27,000 for literacy programs • Funds are used to provide free literacy programs for community members 2. Volunteer duties have been enhanced for the 2015 season to implement skill-based volunteering, allowing you to work in the areas that interest you the most • LFLF has volunteer positions related to communications, accounting, art and design • A commitee organizes the event, and each volunteer is assigned a task that is most meaningful to them. Leadership roles are available 3. Engaging in consistent volunteerism with Literacy for Life is an excellent addition to your resume, and we are committed to providing you with work that will aid in your professional and personal development • The majority of employers see consistent volunteerism as an asset • Members of the media, as well as corporate sponsors, attend our events which offers the ability for our volunteers to network. with other professionals Potential Volunteers: 1. Literacy for Life provides a fulfilling volunteer experience that positively impacts the community. Proof Points: • $27,000 was raised at last year’s Grate Groan Up Spelling Bee, which is allocated toward the enhancement and implementation of effective literacy programs • Volunteers are able to personally connect with clients at LFLF 2. By volunteering at Literacy for Life, you can implement your existing knowledge while adding to your current skillset. • The event organizing commitees allow you to choose the task that resonates with you • Learning coach positions are available, allowing you to gain teaching skills 3. Volunteering with Literacy for Life provides you with the ability to spark new relationships with community members that can be of both a personal and professional benefit • A variety of corporate organizations participate in the Grate Groan Up Spelling Bee, giving our volunteers the ability to network both personally and professionally • Volunteers are involved in each aspect of the organization, meaning that they are personally able to communicate with clients in order to make a larger impact in the community\n\n60. With scarce resources both in terms of personnel hours and funding, LFLF’s budget for communications is tight: LFLF has been given an initial time budget of 27 hours, to be followed by eight to ten hours monthly. The overall financing required for the project will be $192.50. Because of this, the proposed budget has been created in such a way that it can be scaled down to fit LFLF’s resources as they fluctuate over time. The following budget utilizes Smith’s concept of objective-based budgeting where the organization will utilize its resources to implement the tactics integral to achieving its objectives (2013, p.321). To achieve LFLF’s objectives stated previously, this budget model uses tactics according to resource availability. The budget is broken down based on the five major tactics discussed previously. Within each section, costs considered include personnel, production, distribution and materials. The full budget can be seen in appendix F. Program evaluation is one of the most important steps of a strategic communications plan. Through evaluation, LFLF will be able to measure its progress in reaching the established objectives and make changes as necessary before the plan’s end. In the table below, formative evaluation refers to baseline measurements made so that degree of change can be measured. Midpoint evaluation refers to evaluation that will occur through the plan’s implementation to ensure it is working as intended. Finally, the summative evaluation refers to the final evaluation at the completion of the plan’s implementation.\n\n61. Pacekids Society Social media marketing presents Pacekids with an opportunity to expand and communicate to its key publics in an efficient and cost-effective way. The implementation of a YouTube channel represents a new platform for Pacekids to reach its organizational goals and develop its current social media platforms. The dynamic and fluid nature of social media requires the employment of content guidelines, policies and an overall well-defined strategy. With a clear strategy in place, Pacekids will be able to effectively increase channel subscriptions, video views, as well as drive traffic between existing social media outlets and toward the organization’s home page. Ultimately, the implementation of this new platform will work to increase Pacekids’online presence as a premier treatment centre for children with special needs. Pacekids can only achieve the stated goals if a target audience is clearly defined. Social media success heavily relies on the ability to communicate with the proper publics in an effective way. Targeting the information seeking audience of families with special needs children and educating them with the proper information on Pacekids’therapeutic programs will ultimately increase traffic towards the platform. If implemented properly, Pacekids can utilize YouTube in the following ways: • Provide links to Pacekids’website as well as current social media outlets • Encourage current Facebook and Twitter followers to subscribe to channel • Increase subscription rate with consistent and relevant uploads • Illustrate Pacekids’mission statement effectively through child success stories • Highlight Pacekids’milestone and promotional events • Effectively communicate with key audience to promote Pacekids and increase program sign-up rates Community Service Learning Project - February 2014 YouTube CommunicationsPlan EXECUTIVESUMMARY The target audience for the Pacekids Programs’YouTube channel portion of the awareness and recruitment campaign is potential families with disabled children who could benefit from the services provided by Pacekids. Potential families are currently an aware public who recognize their situation and understand that potential agencies that can provide assistance exist within the city. Many of these members of the key public get referred to agencies from social workers, physicians and other gatekeepers in the community. TARGETAUDIENCE\n\n62.

This YouTube channel will be used to interact with Pacekids’key publics. Videos posted to the channel will help to reinforce the Pacekids know-how and expertise to drive its key publics to action. The channel also aims to drive traffic towards other existing Pacekids social media platforms and its website. Through the integration of Pacekids’web links, key messages and information, the YouTube channel aims to increase awareness, acceptance, and drive action towards Pacekids’therapeutic programs. YouTube provides the capability to interact with key publics in an entertaining and impactful way.\n\n63. INTEGRATION The following points provide suggestions of how to properly and effectively integrate YouTube into Pacekids’existing social media outlets on an ongoing basis. 1. Begin by deciding how often to make posts from Pacekids social media outlets. • Tweets, Facebook posts and YouTube videos should be updated regularly in order to provide new and relevant content. • Develop a content plan. • Will Pacekids be posting high-quality material once per month, or shorter informational bits on a weekly basis? • Likely, Pacekids will want to be consistent with a theme of heartfelt videos. 2. Be prepared to capture special moments on film at any given time. • Have a camera handy in case something video-worthy happens unexpectedly. • Take opportunities to interview anyone visiting the Pacekids facility who as a story. • At events, begin filming even if nothing particular is happening. These videos can be used as fillers and transitional shots in future videos. • The idea is to be prepared to capture content that can be used later. 3. Create an abundance of footage. • It is a good idea to capture an amount of footage that can be edited into numerous clips. 4. Review resources and examine content. • What content does Pacekids already possess which can be used for future videos? • Who is available both internally (employees) and externally (parents or donors) for speaking roles in videos? • Create separate videos which highlight each of Pacekids’programs individually. 5. Promote YouTube videos via Twitter, Facebook, and main Pacekids website • Tweet about new videos. • Post them to Facebook. • Post them to any blogs regarding Pacekids. • Send completed videos out with press releases to bloggers so they have an opportunity to learn more about Pacekids. In order to strategically evaluate the success of the YouTube content, views and video comments will be taken into account. If a specific video gains a significantly higher number of views than others, then that type of content will be deemed most effective. YouTube has a monitoring program built into its design in order to measure views and feedback. This allows for accurate measurements to be analyzed when evaluating the success of the channel. Through an ongoing content analysis of the channel, it is possible to disseminate messages and analyze the effectiveness of the content. Additionally, the size of the audience can be reported and feedback can be given either by comments, or by one-on-one interviews with parents who have been exposed to the YouTube content. The final evaluation will be used by Pacekids to decide how it can allow the channel to be sustainable over a longer time frame. By providing specific measurements regarding the reach of the channel, Pacekids will be able to decide which type of content is the most effective. KEYMETRICS\n\n64. Fortress Mountain Ski Resort Social Media Analysis & Strategy - November 2013 Strengths • Facebook presence (0ver 1,000 likes) • Close proximity to the city • New added winter activities to attract new audiences (igloo building, snow shoeing, ice climbing wall) • Transportation services provided to get skiers up to the lodge, and to the ski shop • Evaluate every skier’s abilities and a ski run plan Weaknesses • 6 years of on-going construction (not currently open) • Not communicating end construction dates to skiers • Snow Cat Skiing limits clientele to a very small niche audience • Renovations and construction are costly • Twitter page lacks original content, is just simple linked to Facebook feed Opportunities • Reach out to advanced skiers that would appreciate a less crowded ski hill with more channelling runs • Promotion of tourism for Alberta and skiing • Strong relationship with Travel Alberta • Market to other types of skiers other than advanced • Building relationships with surrounding ski hills through cross promotion Threats • People gravitating to other ski hills • Competition with other ski hills • Not as recognized as other major ski hills • $450 for Snow Cat Skiing per individual • Weather (road conditions) • Gas prices (people having to drive) SWOT Analysis Social Media Analysis Fortress Mountain is currently active on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube, and their website links directly to each of these platforms. Their Facebook page posts a lot of photos of cat skiing and talks about snowfall, but more emphasis should be put on when they are planning to reopen the hill and updates of the construction process. Their Twitter feed is just a repeat of all of their Facebook posts with links back to their page. They should post more original content rather than repeating everything they already stated on other platforms, and should also interact with their followers to increase engagement. There are no replies to followers or retweets, and the automated Facebook posts show that they do not put any effort into their Twitter page, it is just simply there as another social media platform to be on and is not looked after. Their Youtube channel only has 6 videos, 4 of which are just copies of Travel Alberta’s“Remember to Breathe”campaign, so there is only 2 videos with original content. Nothing has been posted for the past year. Their website is poorly designed and appears that is has not been updated for quite some time.\n\n65. Social Media Strategy As once loved ski hill by many Calgarians and others from surrounding areas, the new Fortress Mountain will attract its former skiers as a new and improved ski hill to enjoy with friends and family. The new Fortress Mountain ski hill will provide services and activities to a variety of skiers from advanced skiers to families. Both Snow Cat Skiing for advanced skiers, regular skiing including Blue, Green, and a variety of Black Diamond runs will be available, which will appeal to a wide variety of audiences and potential new customers and position Fortress Mountain as a direct competitor among the elite ski hills in the Alberta area. The social and digital media strategy for the re-opening of Fortress Mountain will incorporate all of these key audiences by creating and disseminating the overall message of Fortress Mountain as a multipurpose ski hill to be used by all skiers. Social Media Tactics - Awareness Building Facebook • To drive awareness partnering with a retail ski and snowboarding company • Using Facebook to create two-way communication with guests. Inviting them to like the page, comment, post pictures • Facebook will be used to let people know what types of activities we offer in addition to skiing and snowboarding • Facebook will be used to launch contests Instagram • Using Instagram to post photos of our runs and the beautiful scenery • Use Instagram to allow guests to post the pictures they capture throughout the day • Contests through Instagram by using certain hashtags on photos taken at the hill • Using Instagram video to capture events and skiers on the hill • Using Instagram to showcase staff and regular skiers Twitter • Twitter will be used to post information about weather conditions • Updates on current information about anything going on at Fortress Mountain • Countdown to the opening of the ski hill • Posting information about any special offers • Posting any information about current promotions and contest YouTube channel • Guests can post their own videos of people skiing and snowboarding on the hill • Targeted videos for the advanced skiers of skiers and snowboarders going off jumps and doing tricks\n\n66.

Canadian Public Relations Research Foundation January 28, 2013 For immediate release NEWS RELEASE Former editor of Calgary Journal speaks of the future in media relations TORONTO – January 28 – The Canadian Public Relations Research Foundation (CPRRF) held their tenth annual media relations conference this past Saturday, Jan. 26, uniting professionals working in the media for conversation about the future of media relations in their fields. Christine Ramos, one of the key speakers at the conference provided a vision of the future of media relations through the lens of a journalist and editor. Ramos is a former writer, section editor, and co-editor and chief for the Calgary Journal who is now working as a technical freelance writer. The importance of online presence through social media in the future of media relations was a topic of discussion.“Breaking the news has become a race between civilian journalists, bloggers and other news sources,”said Ramos,“there are so many platforms and people communicating messages that it becomes more competitive, and these social media spheres will only continue to grow in size and importance.” Ramos explained that in the midst of this social media revolution, media relations professionals need to remember that“People are you’re best tool. Establishing a sense personability, some type of connection besides the fact that PR and journalists are making a business transaction in the form of trading information.” Over 500 influential people in the Canadian media community attend the CPRF media relations conference every year to strengthen relationships between public relations professionals and journalists, with the goal of providing truth to Canadians through the media.

THE ETHICS OF CSR IN PROFESSIONAL SPORT: An Analysis of Professional Hockey CSR Programs To what extent do CSR campaigns need to reflect organizational culture in professional sports? RESEARCH Q: VS. HITMEN FIGHT CANCER TEAM GIORDANO IMPLICATIONS: • high media scrutiny = high expectations of community involvment • atheletes = brand ambassadors of campaigns & public figures • social media = atheletes online actions affect CSR campaigns Hitmen Fight Cancer Campaign • School outreach program launched by Calgary Flames captain, Mark Giordano & his wife • Promotes physical fitness, academics, healthy lifestyles, leadership development, community involvement & positive behavior in local schools • Includes a mentorship program integrated with the core success factors in hockey to help kids • Aligns with the mission of the Calgary Flames organization: “to ensure that the team would have a positive impact on the quality of life in Southern Alberta” • partnership with Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation for 7 years • annual home game at the end of October is main support (Breast Cancer awareness month) • Hitmen players wear the original jersey of the team, pink jerseys that are auctioned off after • Original jerseys are not pink in colour because to support breast cancer, this evolved after • Organization is at risk for being accused of “pink-washing” due to male-dominated internal structure in management & team aspects PINK-WASHING: CASE ANALYSISCSR IN THE PROFESSIONAL SPORT INDUSTRY “A company or organization that claims to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time produces, makes or sells products that are linked to the disease ” CONCLUSIONS: • Current literature suggests that successful CSR programs reflect internal culture and that ethics need to be woven into the cultural fabric of the organization that flows through the values of every employee RECOMMENDATIONS: Due to the male-dominated internal structure of professional hockey teams and the link between feminist activism and breast cancer support results in an increased possibility for sports teams to be accused of pink-washing. • Awareness of pink washing as a public relations threat for professional sports teams engaging in breast cancer support • The need for internal culture, values and mission to be integrated into CSR programs Team Giordano Program\n\n83.
