        "text": "Fairfield University’s School of Engineering and Computing has been awarded a grant of $469,995 over four years (2024-2028) from the National Science Foundation, for the advancement of AI (artificial intelligence).\n\nProfessor and Chair of Computer Science Xiaoli Yang, PhD is the principal investigator of the grant, titled “Collaborative Research: A Semiconductor Curriculum and Learning Framework for High-Schoolers Using Artificial Intelligence, Game Modules, and Hands-on Experiences.”\n\n“The NSF ITEST grant I recently received aims to assist high-school students in developing skills and career interests in the semiconductor fields through an innovative game-based learning platform, hands-on activities, and industry field trips,” said Dr. Yang.\n\nThis is part of a larger $1.3 million multi-institutional project grant, in partnership with University of Maine and Southern Methodist University, to develop the first game-based semiconductor learning materials incorporating AI and ChatGPT to guide high-school students. The program will help high school students to develop skills and knowledge of the semiconductor field through an innovative game-based learning platform, hands-on activities, and industry field trips.\n\n“Our students will design and integrate an AI educator, a generative AI tool for education, into game-based learning. The AI educator will provide students with suggestions, assistance, and additional study materials about the subject matter,” explained Dr. Yang. “Moreover, the AI component will be responsible for fine-tuning the output content based on student’s interests, hobbies, and preferences to make the learning experience more relatable.”"
