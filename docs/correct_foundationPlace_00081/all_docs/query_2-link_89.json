        "text": "At the Open Source Leadership Summit, Chris Aniszczyk, COO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation announced that Kubernetes had been graduated to become a full-blown open source project.\n\nKubernetes is one of the fastest growing open source projects. According to Krihelinator, a project that tracks the popular projects on Github, Kubernetes ranks as the second most popular open source project. It is undoubtedly one of the fastest moving projects in the history of open source.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) was set up in 2015 to make cloud-native computing universal and sustainable. Cloud-native applications are modern, contemporary applications that are designed as microservices, packaged as containers, and deployed on elastic, virtual infrastructure. Since its inception, CNCF has become the custodian of various related projects such as Prometheus, Opentracing, Fluentd, gRPC and envoy.\n\nKubernetes has been enjoying widespread adoption among startups, platform vendors, and enterprises. Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft offer managed Kubernetes under the Containers as a Service (CaaS) model. The open source ecosystem has dozens of players building various tools covering logging, monitoring, automation, storage, and networking aspects of Kubernetes. System integrators have dedicated practices and offerings based on Kubernetes. Global players like Uber, Bloomberg, Blackrock, BlaBlaCar, The New York Times, Lyft, eBay, Buffer, Squarespace, Ancestry, GolfNow, Goldman Sachs and many others are using Kubernetes in production at massive scale. According to Redmonk, a developer-focused research company, 71 percent of the Fortune 100 use containers and more than 50 percent of Fortune 100 companies use Kubernetes as their container orchestration platform.\n\nAmong existing CNCF projects, Kubernetes is the first one to graduate. According to CNCF, the key criterion to graduate is to have a public list of project adopters for at least the primary repository. It should also have committers from two large organizations.\n\nGiven the attention Kubernetes got from Google, IBM, Red Hat, Huawei and others, it’s not surprising to see Kubernetes graduate from its current status. According to Stackalytics, Google continues to be the largest contributor to Kubernetes followed by Red Hat.\n\nKubernetes has already won the container orchestration war. With two of the alternatives – Docker Swarm and Mesosphere DC/OS – supporting the project, it has become the de facto orchestration platform for running cloud native workloads.\n\nKubernetes has been a well-managed open source project. It managed to strike the right balance between commercial implementations and sustaining the contributions from the community. Google’s interest in making it as the best container management platform is one of the key reasons for its success. There are multiple vendors that want the project to be commercially viable. The release cadence, governance, and the structure of working groups contributed to the overall success of the project. Kubernetes is one of the best-managed open source projects of the recent past. In the coming years, it will become the building block of infrastructure for both enterprises and public cloud vendors."
