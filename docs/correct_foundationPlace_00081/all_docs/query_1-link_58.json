        "text": "Overview\n\nThe syllabus is expertly curated to progressively take students from no technical, or security knowledge, to a level where they are speaking the same language as industry professionals.\n\nTopics\n\nIntroduction\n\nLearning the Foundations - introduction to the SANS Foundations course and training platform, including how to use the product.\n\nComputer Components and Concepts\n\nThis module focuses on the different components of a computer, what they do, and how they work together. It looks at Computer Hardware, Data Storage & Representation, Logic & Data Manipulation, Storing Data & Files, Cloud Computing, Operating Systems and Virtualization.\n\nLinux\n\nThis module introduces students to Linux, the Linux Environment, Linux Navigation, Commands, and Linux Architecture and Components. These subjects help students develop a working knowledge and understanding of installing Linux, navigation and structure, permissions, and commands such as grep, cp, and much more. This module is rich in labs to helps students practice their skills.\n\nThe Web\n\nThis module provides a look into how search engines work, and the most efficient ways to use them, as well as introducing web servers, HTML and cookies.\n\nNetworking Fundamentals\n\nThis module helps students understand core networking concepts and protocols including networking components and hardware, packets, types of network addresses, TCP and UDP protocols, subnetting, and email.\n\nServers and Services\n\nThis module helps students understand the different server types by introducing web, database, DNS (Domain Name System), Log, and Email servers; looking at their basic setup and installation procedures. The module covers basic hardening and configuration and concludes with a deep dive into Cloud Computing.\n\nPractical Programming and Concepts\n\nThe module is a student's first look at programming in Python and C. The sections incrementally teach what a program is and how it works, before delving into writing basic programming, and introducing various strategies, tools, and conventions. These sections are lab-heavy, including labs such as variables in python, user input in python, reading and writing files, using TCP sockets, printing in C, string handling, and more!\n\nSQL\n\nThis module teaches students about basic statements, joins, operators and database admins. Learning the fundamentals of SQL will help prepare students for more Offensive Security Concepts work later in the course.\n\nWindows Foundations\n\nThe Windows Foundations module helps students get familiar with key Windows CLI commands, understanding permissions and access control, and elements of Windows as it relates to file systems, architecture, and networking. This module also looks at Windows uses, installation, network setup, configuration, changing settings, log files, the registry, file permissions, user accounts, Windows command line, scripting, and Powershell.\n\nAdvanced Computer Hardware\n\nThe Advanced Computer Hardware module looks at how the CPU and RAM work in depth (e.g., Memory: Stack and Heap). It introduces, and looks at GDB in practice, along with how to track execution, with advanced storage mechanisms such as RAID and cloud storage mechanisms. The module also covers an introduction into Assembly, and it explores mnemonics.\n\nSecurity Concepts\n\nThis module introduces students to the concepts and terminology associated with cryptography, whilst becoming familiar with the ethical and legal concerns associated with hacking. They cover a variety of topics and tools such as encryption, encoding, hashing, the law, ethics, red teams vs. blue team, risk management, critical security controls, Kali Linux, Slingshot and SIFT, reconnaissance tools and techniques, and the basics of digital forensics (e.g., steganography, memory captures).\n\nOffensive Security Concepts\n\nThis module introduces students to offensive security concepts and exploitation techniques, such as command injection, SQL injection, session guessing, directory traversal, clickjacking, buffer overflows, phishing, Metasploit, social engineering, privilege escalation, kernel exploits, bypassing UAC, stored credentials, and more!\n\nNetwork and Computer Infiltration\n\nThis module covers topics and methods for persistence, lateral movement, and exfiltration. Students learn about indicators of compromise, ports, Yara, Rootkits, ARP Cache, extracting passwords from memory, spotting common exfiltration methods, and more.\n\nCourse Summary\n\nThe summary refreshes the memory as it reviews all the course material and prepares the student for the final GFACT (GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies) exam."
