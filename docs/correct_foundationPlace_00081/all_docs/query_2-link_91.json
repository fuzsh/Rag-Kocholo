        "text": "We are excited to launch Ada Computer Science, the new online learning platform for teachers, students, and anyone interested in learning about computer science.\n\nWith the rapid advances being made in AI systems and chatbots built on large language models, such as ChatGPT, it’s more important than ever that all young people understand the fundamentals of computer science.\n\nOur aim is to enable young people all over the world to learn about computer science through providing access to free, high-quality and engaging resources that can be used by both students and teachers.\n\nA partnership between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the University of Cambridge, Ada Computer Science offers comprehensive resources covering everything from algorithms and data structures to computational thinking and cybersecurity. It also has nearly 1000 rigorously researched and automatically marked interactive questions to test your understanding. Ada Computer Science is improving all the time, with new content developed in response to user feedback and the latest research. Whatever your interest in computer science, Ada is the place for you.\n\nIf you’re teaching or studying a computer science qualification at school, you can use Ada Computer Science for classwork, homework, and revision. Computer science teachers can select questions to set as assignments for their students and have the assignments marked directly. The assignment results help you and your students understand how well they have grasped the key concepts and identify areas where they would benefit from further tuition. Students can learn with the help of written materials, concept illustrations, and videos, and they can test their knowledge and prepare for exams.\n\nA comprehensive resource for computing education\n\nAda Computer Science builds on work we’ve done to support the English school system as part of the National Centre for Computing Education, funded by the Department for Education.\n\nThe topics on the website map to exam board specifications for England’s Computer Science GCSE and A level, and will map to other curricula in the future.\n\nIn addition, we want to make it easy for educators and learners across the globe to use Ada Computer Science. That’s why each topic is aligned to our own comprehensive taxonomy of computing content for education, which is independent of the English curriculum, and organises the content into 11 strands, including programming, computing systems, data and information, artificial intelligence, creating media, and societal impacts of digital technology.\n\nIf you are interested in how we can specifically adapt Ada Computer Science for your region, exam specification, or specialist area, please contact us.\n\nWhy use Ada Computer Science at school?\n\nAda Computer Science enables teachers to:\n\nPlan lessons around high-quality content\n\nSet self-marking homework questions\n\nPinpoint areas to work on with students\n\nManage students’ progress in a personal markbook\n\nStudents get:\n\nFree computer science resources, written by specialist teachers\n\nA huge bank of interactive questions, designed to support learning\n\nA powerful revision tool for exams\n\nAccess wherever and whenever you want\n\nIn addition:\n\nThe topics include real code examples in Python, Java, VB, and C#\n\nThe live code editor features interactive coding tasks in Python\n\nQuizzes make it quick and easy to set work"
