        "text": "Why Globus Compute?\n\nRemote computing is notoriously complicatedâthe Globus compute platform takes care of complex infrastructure management tasks so you can focus on running the code you want, when and where you want. Using Globus means you no longer waste timeâ¦\n\nâ¦figuring out credentials and different authentication mechanisms\n\nâ¦configuring and managing batch jobs and schedulers\n\nâ¦interacting with resource managers, waiting in queues and scaling nodes\n\nâ¦configuring the execution environment for different compute systems\n\nâ¦retrieving and sharing computation results\n\nOnce your code is ready, the Globus compute platform allows you to run it anywhere you have access to compute resourcesâand move it to other systems, without having to overcome the same infrastructure management obstacles.\n\nThe Globus compute platform incorporates work from the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, supported by funding from the National Science Foundation and an Argonne National Laboratory Directed Research and Development award."
