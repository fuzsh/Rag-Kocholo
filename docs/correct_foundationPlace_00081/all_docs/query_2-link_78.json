We participate in this fantastic organization in multiple ways. On top of being a Silver member of the CNCF ourselves, Terramate is also part of the community driving the development, maintenance, and adoption of the OpenTofu project, which recently became managed by the Linux Foundation.\n\nThis means you will see a lot more of us around the community. We will be participating in delivering content to the CNCF Blog and webinars, and also be part of the live events, such as KubeCon / Cloud-Native Con. So be on the lookout for all the great new stuff coming."
