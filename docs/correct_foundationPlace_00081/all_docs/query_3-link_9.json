As part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) re/Start program, today's lesson focused more on the fundamental concepts of computing explaining the basic value of technology and some of the terms we will encounter in the upcoming lessons.\n\nUnderstanding the digital world\n\nTo get things started at an easy pace, let's first get an understanding of how you interact with computers. Think about the last time you interacted with an online platform, watching a video, making a purchase or even chatting with a friend. Think of the process you used all this is the power of computing.\n\nIn today's world technology has been integrated into our daily lives serving as part of our daily routine. We highly depend on technology to make most of our daily activities happen. Its impact can be felt across multiple fields such as:\n\nEducation\n\nE-commerce\n\nFinance\n\nSecurity\n\nCommunication\n\nEntertainment etc...\n\nWith these few examples, we can see that technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, transforming how we work, communicate, and live.\n\nBasic Computing Terms\n\nFor us to navigate the upcoming lessons, we need to get a solid understanding of some of the basic computing terms.\n\nApplication - this is a set of instructions that runs on a computer to perform a specific task. Applications can be generally defined depending on the device they run on for example:\n\nA web application - they run on a web server or app server and are accessed over the browser.\n\nMobile application - runs on mobile devices and is also accessed via mobile devices.\n\nDesktop applications - they run on and are accessed via a desktop computer. eg word processor\n\nInternet of Things applications (IoT) - they run on and are accessed via specialized devices connected to the internet. eg smartwatch\n\nProgram - this is written code in a given programming language. They are generally called software. some of the most popular programming languages include Python, C#, Java, JS, PHP, Ruby C++, etc...\n\nComputer Components\n\nA computer is a complex yet easy-to-understand piece of equipment. It's comprised of various interconnected components that work together to perform a variety of tasks.\n\nThese parts are divided into two main parts:\n\nHardware - the physical/tangible components of a computer such as the CPU, memory, etc...\n\nSoftware - applications and programs installed on the computer such the the OS.\n\nHere's an overview of the primary components found inside a computer:\n\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU) - mostly referred to as the brain of the computer. It executes the instructions it receives from the applications and the OS.\n\nMemory(RAM) - temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU is using.\n\nStorage devices - used to store and retrieve data. Can be divided into either Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) or Solid State Drives (SDD).\n\nMotherboard - it houses the CPU, memory, and other essential components. It provides the connection between different parts of the computer.\n\nGraphical processing unit - it's responsible for rendering graphics and images.\n\nInput devices - Keyboard, mouse, touchpad, trackpad, webcam, etc...\n\nOutput devices - monitor, printer, speakers, etc...\n\nNetworking components - one of the components is the Network Interface Card (NIC) which enables the comp to connect to the network either wired or wireless.\n\nHaving a clear understanding of these components and how they interact with each other makes it easier for you to troubleshoot, or even upgrade computers remember as technology continues to evolve new components and configurations may emerge but these fundamentals will remain.\n\nSee you in the next part of the series tomorrow. If you are here for the first time check my other articles on the AWS re/Start program series where I share my journey into cloud computing."
