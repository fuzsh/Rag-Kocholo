The respective collections also provide detailed documentation to deploy the content for specific use cases.\n\nNGC catalog offers ready-to-use collections for various applications, including NLP, ASR, intelligent video analytics, and object detection.\n\nThe NGC catalog hosts containers for the top AI and data science software, tuned, tested, and optimized by NVIDIA. Fully tested containers for HPC applications and data analytics are also available, allowing users to build solutions from a tested framework with complete control.\n\nThe NGC catalog hosts pretrained GPU-optimized models for a variety of common AI tasks that ‌developers can use as-is or retrain them easily, thus saving valuable time in bringing solutions to market. Each model comes with a model resume outlining the architecture, training details, datasets used, and limitations. NVIDIA AI Foundation models enable developers to experience the models directly in their browsers, integrate them into applications using APIs or download and run them on Windows machines with RTX GPUs.\n\nThe NGC catalog hosts tutorial Jupyter notebooks for a variety of use cases—including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation—to give developers a head start in building AI models. It also provides the flexibility to modify the notebooks and build custom solutions.\n\nContainers, models, and SDKs from the NGC catalog can be deployed on a managed Jupyter Notebook service with a single click.\n\nHelm charts automate software deployment on Kubernetes clusters. The NGC catalog hosts Kubernetes-ready Helm charts that make it easy to consistently and secure deploy both NVIDIA and third-party software.\n\nNVIDIA GPU Operator is a suite of NVIDIA drivers, container runtime, device plug-in, and management software that IT teams can install on Kubernetes clusters to give users faster access to run their workloads."
