Azure confidential computing encrypts data in memory in hardware-based trusted execution environments and processes it only after the cloud environment is verified, helping prevent data access by cloud providers, administrators, and users. Build on top of secure hardware using familiar tools, software, and cloud infrastructure, or migrate your existing workloads and applications.\n\nCombine datasets confidentially, without exposing your data to other contributing organizations. Benefit from confidential computing and great AI and machine learning insights. Upload encrypted data to a secure enclave in a virtual machine and perform algorithms on datasets from multiple sources.\n\nMigrate to the cloud and keep full control of your data in a trusted execution environment. Specify the hardware and software that have access to your data and code, and verifiably enforce this guarantee. Customers retain control over their protected information so they can meet government regulations and compliance needs. Customize your confidential computing path using tools and solutions built in Azure, in open-source frameworks, and by independent software vendor partners."
