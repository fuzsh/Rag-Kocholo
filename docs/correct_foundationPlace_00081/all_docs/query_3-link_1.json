        "text": "Quiz\n\nPassing score: 75%\n\nIn the Google Cloud resource hierarchy, into which entity are resources organized?\n\nZones\n\nFolders\n\nProjects [✅ Correct]\n\nOrganization node\n\nIn the Google Cloud resource hierarchy, resources are organized into projects. A project is the first grouping mechanism of the Google Cloud resource hierarchy, and it represents a collection of related Google Cloud resources that share common IAM policies, billing, and configuration settings. A project can contain one or more service resources, such as Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, or Pub/Sub topics. All service resources belong to a project, and a project can belong to a folder or an organization, which are higher-level grouping mechanisms in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy.\n\n2. Which project identifier does not need to be globally unique?\n\nProject name [✅ Correct]\n\nProject ID\n\nProject number\n\nThe project identifier that does not need to be globally unique is the project name. The project name is a human-readable name for your project, that you create when you create the project. The project name is not used by any Google APIs, and you can edit the project name at any time. Project names do not need to be unique, and different projects can have the same name. However, the project ID and the project number are both globally unique identifiers for your project, that are automatically generated by Google Cloud when you create the project. The project ID is a unique string that is used to differentiate your project from all others in Google Cloud, and the project number is a unique number that is used to identify your project in Google’s internal systems. You cannot change the project ID or the project number after the project is created.\n\n3. Which billing tool is designed to prevent the over-consumption of resources due to an error or a malicious attack?\n\nBudgets\n\nReports\n\nAlerts\n\nQuotas [✅ Correct]\n\nThe billing tool that is designed to prevent the over-consumption of resources due to an error or a malicious attack is Quotas. Quotas are limits on the amount of resources or operations that you can use or perform in Google Cloud. Quotas help protect you from unexpected spikes in usage and billing, and also help Google manage the overall system capacity and reliability. There are different types of quotas, such as allocation quotas, rate quotas, and spending quotas, and they apply to different resources and services.\n\n4. Which command line tool is part of the Cloud SDK?\n\nGit\n\ngsutil [✅ Correct]\n\nSSH\n\nBash\n\nThe command line tool that is part of the Cloud SDK is gsutil. This tool allows you to access and manage Cloud Storage resources from the command line. You can use gsutil to perform tasks such as creating and deleting buckets, uploading and downloading objects, copying and moving objects, and setting permissions and metadata.\n\n5. What is the purpose of APIs offered by various Google Cloud services?\n\nAPIs provide Google Cloud console access through a simple web-based graphical user interface.\n\nAPIs allow code to be written to control Google Cloud services. [✅ Correct]\n\nAPIs provide monthly pricing discounts.\n\nAPIs allow physical access to data centers.\n\nThe purpose of APIs offered by various Google Cloud services is to allow code to be written to control Google Cloud services. APIs, or application programming interfaces, are sets of rules and protocols that define how different software components can communicate and interact with each other. By using APIs, you can programmatically access and manipulate Google Cloud resources and data, using your preferred programming language and platform. For example, you can use the Compute Engine API to create and manage virtual machines, the Vision API to analyze images, or the Dialogflow API to build conversational interfaces."
