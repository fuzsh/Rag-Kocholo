It is the practice of conveying messages to the public through the media on behalf of a client, with the intention of changing public opinion and behavior. PR originated from propaganda but sought to present accurate information to gain public trust. Early pioneers like Ivy Lee and Edward Bernays professionalized the field by advising clients to provide transparency and engage stakeholders. Bernays also advocated appealing to opinion leaders to indirectly influence broader audiences. PR is now used widely by organizations, governments, and others to promote causes, products, and ideas through various traditional and new media.\n\nA history of education 1900 - 1950\n\nA history of education 1900 - 1950orogers1\n\nThe document discusses key events and developments in education between 1900-1950.

Between the 1950s and 1970s, as medical care improved survival rates for conditions affecting communication, a few rehabilitation professionals began exploring augmentative ways to foster communication. The field of AAC emerged as a specialized area in the 1980s with the founding of the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication to advocate for this approach."
