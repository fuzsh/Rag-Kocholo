        "text": "NEW YORK, May 20, 2022 (Newswire.com) – Ready Computing, a leader in healthcare IT and interoperability within the federal, state, and commercial sectors, is excited to share that the Veterans Data Integration and Federation (VDIF) Enterprise Platform (EP) program has been selected for the 2022 FedHealthIT Innovation Award, which will be celebrated at the 8th Annual FedHealthIT Innovation Awards and Networking Event.\n\nAccording to FedHealth IT, “This award recognizes and honors the Federal Health technology and consulting community by celebrating programs nominated and selected by their peers for driving innovation and results across the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Military Health System, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.”\n\nSince the program’s inception in 2019, Ready Computing has served the VDIF program in the prime contractor role. Ready Computing’s partners, B3 Group and Ellumen, have served as subcontractors on the program.\n\nThe VDIF Enterprise Platform enables the composition of a comprehensive Veteran Health Record that’s interoperable across the VA enterprise as well as with external VA partners such as the Department of Defense. InterSystems HealthShare underpins the VDIF-EP and implements a variety of services and standards-based APIs to collect, normalize, persist, secure, and share the Veteran medical information with authorized users.\n\nImproving the health and wellness of Veterans across the country has been a matter of public concern for decades. The VDIF program alleviates many of these concerns by ensuring clinicians and providers at all VA facilities have access to complete and accurate Veteran health records at the time of care.\n\nThe 8th Annual FedHealthIT Innovation Awards and Networking Event will be held on Tuesday, June 7, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
