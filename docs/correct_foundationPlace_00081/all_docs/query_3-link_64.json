        "text": "Cloud-based service and infrastructure\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics, and machine learning, alongside a set of management tools.[2] It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, and Google Docs, according to Verma et al.[3] Registration requires a credit card or bank account details.[4]\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments.\n\nIn April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform is a part[5] of Google Cloud, which includes the Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as Google Workspace (G Suite), enterprise versions of Android and ChromeOS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services.\n\nGoogle lists over 100 products under the Google Cloud brand.
