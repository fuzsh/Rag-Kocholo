        "text": "An increasing number of quantum computing companies are emerging globally with the goal of creating operational processors and the hardware and software that enable them. This article looks to provide a high-level overview of the landscape of quantum computing companies for now, and into 2024.\n\nIf you’re looking for more information on these companies, enriched by our analysts and updated regularly, you may be interested in exploring our intelligence platform:\n\nNonetheless, if you would like to offer an edit or suggestion, you can get in touch at our Contact Us page\n\nQuantum Computing in Modern Industries\n\nIn sectors like healthcare, cybersecurity, and finance, quantum computing (QC) is poised to present novel avenues for tackling computational challenges. In contrast to other intricate tech fields like artificial intelligence (AI) or virtual reality (VR), quantum computing often appears as an enigma to most individuals, save for its practitioners. There exists limited comprehension regarding the potential of a quantum computer or the factors setting it apart from a classical computer.\n\nHarnessing specialized hardware and software, quantum computers are expected to have the capacity to execute tasks that presently lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. Furthermore, quantum computing companies are actively crafting technologies to enhance the accessibility and usability of this state-of-the-art technology.\n\nAs fresh innovations continue to emerge, the realm of quantum computing is experiencing rapid expansion. Let’s delve into the proliferation of quantum computing companies over the past two decades.\n\nSee also: What is Quantum Computing? [Everything You Need to Know]\n\nThe Rise of Quantum Computing Companies\n\nThe taxonomy that we have used to classify quantum computing companies has the following sections: “Quantum Computing Giants”, “Hardware-focused Quantum Computing Companies” and “Software-focused Quantum Computing Companies”, as well as a section for key enablers, which is non-exhaustive. In our review, we include circa one hundred quantum computing companies based on data from our Quantum Intelligence Platform.\n\nIt was inevitable that we would have to omit many of the players in the supply chain; our Quantum Intelligence Platform has many more organizations within its database than we could include here. The purpose of this article is to highlight both the leaders in hardware and software quantum computing, as well as the important startups in the industry with promising research, products, or services.\n\nJust to give you a heads up, we have also published a few in-depth articles in the past that explore some of the best quantum computing startups, available to read here and here.\n\nThe ecosystem of suppliers, hardware companies, and software companies will grow more complex as quantum computing becomes more mainstream. As always, The Quantum Insider will cover them in news stories and include them in our platform. Several quantum security-related players have also been excluded from this analysis, though some of them have been highlighted when appropriate in both the hardware and software sections.\n\nThe list of quantum computing companies is current as of mid-December 2023.\n\nTop Quantum Computing Companies\n\nThe Corporate Giants in Quantum Computing\n\nAmong the prominent entities in the quantum computing (QC) arena originating from the United States – Google, IBM, Microsoft, and AWS (Amazon) – only IBM boasts a legacy of over a century in technological innovation. The remaining trio, comprising Google, Microsoft, and AWS, has a (comparatively) shorter computing history.\n\nNotably, other significant contenders, which we’ve encompassed in our consideration, are cognizant of the substantial ramifications that quantum computing and quantum computing enterprises are destined to exert across various domains in the medium and long run. These contenders are initiating their own quantum computing research and development initiatives, driven by the ambition to remain relevant as the industry transcends the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), advances to fault-tolerant capabilities, and ultimately attains the coveted state of quantum advantage, marking a new era in computation.\n\n1. IBM\n\nEstablished in 1911 in Endicott, New York, under the stewardship of entrepreneur Charles Ranlett Flint, IBM stands as one of the world’s global technology behemoths. Within the realm of quantum exploration, the IBM Quantum Composer and the IBM Quantum Lab (formerly recognized as the IBM Quantum Experience) jointly compose an online platform. This platform offers both public and premium access to cloud-based quantum computing services facilitated by IBM Quantum. The spectrum of offerings encompasses entry to a range of IBM’s experimental quantum processors, a collection of tutorials elucidating quantum computation, and a gateway to an interactive textbook. As of 2023, this service encompasses dozens of devices, with several devices being available to the public without charge. Through this conduit, users are empowered to execute algorithms and experiments, immerse themselves in instructional materials, and engage with simulations that probe the potentials of quantum computing.\n\nIn 2024, it should be noted, IBM Quantum is set to finish constructing a new quantum data center in Ehningen, Germany, thereby introducing local quantum computing resources to Europe.\n\n“Our goal is to achieve quantum advantage as soon as possible. I don’t like to focus so much on dates for specific items without considering instead an entire roadmap to make it possible. To achieve quantum advantage, we need to both increase the performance of the processors and develop a better understanding of how to deal with errors and program a quantum computer.”\n\n— Jay Gambetta, Vice President, IBM Quantum Lab\n\nGuiding the IBM Quantum Lab’s initiatives is Vice President Jay Gambetta, an esteemed IBM Fellow. For a more in-depth exploration of IBM’s trajectory, you can delve into our article spotlighting the evolution of IBM’s commitment to the field of quantum, available here.\n\nUpdate for 2023:\n\nIn June 2023, IBM unveiled a significant milestone, featured in the scientific journal Nature, establishing for the initial time that quantum computers can generate precise outcomes at a magnitude of 100+ qubits surpassing top classical methods.\n\nIn December, IBM unveiled the IBM Condor, a groundbreaking quantum processor with 1,121 superconducting qubits, at the IBM Quantum Summit. Alongside this, it introduced the Quantum Heron processor, featuring 133 fixed-frequency qubits and tunable couplers, boasting a 3-5 times performance enhancement over previous models.
