Working with Kubernetes has opened up new possibilities for us in terms of application portability and operational agility. We continue to be impressed with the high quality and overall integrity of its technical governance and envision it becoming a core component of our infrastructure.\"\n\n-- Sam Ghods, Co-founder & Service Architect, Box\n\n“At eBay, we have been leading and innovating in building and operating one of the largest open private clouds in the world. The emerging landscape of containers and datacenter OS are creating unique opportunities for infrastructure providers and developers who want to seamlessly deliver cloud-first applications. We are excited to join Kubernetes foundation and lead the project in an open and community driven manner to help accelerate the pace of innovation and broad adoption of Kubernetes.”\n\n-- Debashis Saha, Vice President of eBay Cloud Services\n\n\"We share Google's vision of enabling customers to create applications which are container packaged, dynamically scheduled, and micro-services oriented. We are already seeing customers reap the benefits of our investments in Kubernetes and Docker in terms of an improved developer experience, simplified operations, increased efficiency, and an overall increase in the agility and maintainability of applications.\"\n\n-- Lars Herrmann, general manager, Integrated Solutions Business Unit and Container Strategy, Red Hat\n\n\"We operate a complex application ecosystem across a diverse global infrastructure footprint which spans both private infrastructure and public clouds. We see Kubernetes as a leading technology that can significantly dial down the friction to create, deploy, operate, and migrate applications around enterprise infrastructure like ours.”\n\n-- Richard Kaufmann, VP of Architecture at Samsung SDS Research America\n\n\"At Shippable, we've converted to Kubernetes for container orchestration and cluster management of the Shippable platform. We're now running more than one million containers per month on Kubernetes. We were early adopters of Docker and, and as a result, had been a do-it-yourself shop for deploying and running containers for almost two years. Needless to say, we went through a lot of growing pains. Kubernetes has made managing our application and our infrastructure simple and reliable. Before Kubernetes, our developers collectively averaged 120 hours per week on operations-related tasks. Now, it's 2-3 hours, and really I'm being conservative. I only wish Kubernetes had been available two years ago.\"\n\n-- Avi Cavale, CEO, Shippable"
