Platform Computing has always been an interesting company to watch. They have been part of the Grid game since before the words “Grid” and “Computing” were used together, and they have supported themselves entirely through customer sales with no money from venture funding.

Platform CEO Songnian Zhou is adept at keeping the driving forces behind the company fresh while staying true to the ideals that have been the foundation of the company since its inception. I believe this is illustrated well in this article in IT Week.
