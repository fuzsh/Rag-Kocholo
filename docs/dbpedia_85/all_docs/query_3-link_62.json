        "text": "Minus 43 degrees recorded in Montana\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded Friday was minus 43 degrees at an area 4 miles west-northwest of Raynesford, Montana, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn stark contrast, it was 89 in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\nRescuers recover man's body from avalanche zone in Idaho\n\nThe body of a man believed to have been killed in yesterday's Idaho avalanche was recovered by rescuers this afternoon and identified, the Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.\n\nThe man, in a group of three skiers caught in the avalanche near Steven’s Peak yesterday afternoon, was identified today as Corey J. Zalewski, it said. The two others were located by deputies after a Garmin GPS device alerted authorities they were in trouble, the office said.\n\nThose two survived and were recovering, it said. Deputies and members of the U.S. Air Force, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office, Silver Valley Search and Rescue, and the Silver Mountain Ski Patrol were part of the search.\n\nSteven's Peak reaches 7,000 feet near Idaho's border with Montana. It's popular with hikers, skiers and climbers.\n\nA 66-year-old man died in an avalanche in Tahoe, California, on Wednesday.\n\nStorms derail travel plans coast to coast\n\nTwo powerful winter storms are barreling across the country causing hundreds of flight cancellations, creating havoc on highways and burying parts of the Midwest under inches of snow.\n\nMan dies after truck goes through ice on Minnesota lake\n\nAn 80-year-old man died this morning in Minnesota when his truck went through the ice on Mille Lacs Lake, the Mille Lacs County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nA 911 caller said he saw an area on the lake where the truck had gone through the ice and found an adult male in the water nearby wearing a floatation device, officials said. The caller said he was able to recover the man and bring him to shore.\n\nThe man, who has been identified as Richard Francis Gadbois of Isle, Minn., was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.\n\nMille Lacs Lake is about 100 miles north of Minneapolis.\n\nSecond avalanche at Lake Tahoe ski resort\n\nThe day after an avalanche claimed the life of a skier at Palisades Tahoe in Olympic Valley, Calif., a second avalanche rocked the resort.\n\nA second avalanche hit the Wolverine Bowl section of Alpine Meadows about 12:30 p.m. yesterday, resort spokesperson Patrick Lacey said.\n\nNo guests or employees were impacted or injured, but the resort conducted searches of the mountain to be sure, Lacey said. Once the area was cleared, the lift was reopened for the day.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issues state of emergency\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency in anticipation of the severe weather expected to hit the state over the weekend and into next week.\n\nThe Southern state is expecting a \"wintry mix\" in some areas and wind chills in the teens to near freezing for central and northern Louisiana, according to a statement from Landry's office.\n\n“We are encouraging everyone to prepare for these conditions and heed the advice of your local officials,” Landry said. “Road crews are on standby in an attempt to keep our roads open.”\n\nSafety first: Chiefs tell fans to bring blankets, heated clothes to below freezing game\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Feels-like temperatures in the area aren’t expected to climb above zero until Wednesday at the earliest, and some of the fiercest weather is expected tomorrow — the day of the Kansas City Chiefs-Miami Dolphins playoff game at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nThe high for the day is expected to only be 5 degrees, and it’ll be colder than that during the night game.\n\nThe home team wants to keep fans as safe and comfortable as possible and announced some weather accommodations today.\n\nFans will be allowed to bring in blankets, cardboard (to stand on) and portable chargers to power heated apparel.\n\nWarming stations will be set up both inside and outside the stadium.\n\nDesignated drivers will be given hot coffee or hot chocolate to help stave off the bone-chilling weather.\n\nMajor flight cancelations and delays at Chicago's O'Hare\n\nThe most flight cancelations in the world were seen today out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.\n\nMore than 420 (41%) flights originating at the airport were canceled and 280 (27%) were delayed, according to the site. Into O’Hare, 394 (38%) flights were canceled and 224 (21%) were delayed.\n\nNearby Elgin, Ill., was covered in more than 8 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service, and that snow plus strong winds and freezing temperatures will continue throughout the weekend.\n\nBecause of the storms, O'Hare at 3 p.m. local time said it had proactively canceled 850 flights and delays were averaging 25 minutes.\n\nWisconsin man dies while clearing drive near Milwaukee\n\nand\n\nA 69-year-old man was found unresponsive after clearing his driveway with a snow blower in Franklin, Wisc., near Milwaukee and was pronounced dead on scene shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Milwaukee Medical Examiner's office said it will investigate the incident as a weather-related death but will not conduct an autopsy.\n\nPritzker asks Abbott to hold off on bussing migrants to 'save lives' during cold\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker is urging Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to stop bussing migrants to Illinois during the extreme cold snap.\n\nAbbott has been sending busloads of migrants from their arrival point in Texas to major U.S. cities, including Chicago, for months. But as storms dump feet of snow and bring negative windchills to the Midwest, Prizker is asking Abbott to pause.\n\n\"You are now sending asylum seekers from Texas to the Upper Midwest in the middle of winter — many without coats, without shoes to protect them from the snow — to a city whose shelters are already overfilled with migrants you sent here,\" Pritzker wrote in a letter to Abbott.\n\nHe continued: \"Your callousness, sending buses and planes full of migrants in this weather, is now life-threatening to every one of the arrivals. Hundreds of children’s and families’ health and survival are at risk due to your actions.\"\n\nPritzker acknowledged that there should be a bipartisan congressional agreement on a way forward in the current migrant crisis.\n\n\"But right now, we are talking about human beings and their survival,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"I hope we can at least agree on saving lives right now.\"\n\nNearly 200,000 without power\n\nNearly 200,000 people throughout the Midwest, South and Eastern U.S. are without power as dangerous storms and heavy winds wreak havoc across the nation, according to tracking website PowerOutage.us.\n\nSecond powerful winter storm expected to march eastward\n\nA second potent winter storm that was brewing off the North American coast is expected to aim at Oregon and Northern California over the weekend with a firehose of rain and snow.\n\nThe storm will be fueled by an atmospheric river, a stream of precipitation in the sky usually drawn from warmer Pacific waters, and is likely to bring heavy snow to the Cascade Mountains that run from Oregon to Canada, federal forecasters said.\n\n\"A plume of moisture will stream into parts of the Pacific Northwest and California, creating heavy rain,\" the National Weather Service said in its latest forecast discussion.\n\nThe Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, which gives atmospheric rivers a hurricanelike scale of weak (1) to most exceptional (5), says this one will range from 1 to 3 on its AR scale, with 10 inches of rain possible amid the weekend storm's most potent moments.\n\nThe system, expected to bring snow and freezing rain to Portland tonight, will take advantage of the Arctic invasion by continuing to produce snow as it moves east, forecasters said.\n\n\"This system will be interacting with a bitterly cold continental Arctic airmass that is spilling southward out of Canada and may bring lowland snowfall to parts of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps historic blizzard conditions across the upper Midwest in the coming days,\" said a forecast discussion on UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain's Weather West website.\n\nNFL playoff heat up just as temps plummet: Game forecasts\n\nand\n\nHot competition and frigid temperatures are forecast for the NFL playoff games this weekend, as severe winter storms roll through the U.S.\n\nWeather will be extreme at game time at some sites. Here’s what fans can expect at kickoff.\n\nCleveland Browns at Houston Texans — Saturday 3:30 p.m. CST in Houston's NRG Stadium (retractable roof): 62 F\n\nMiami Dolphins at Kansas City Chiefs — Saturday 7 p.m. CST in Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium (outdoors): -4 F (-28 F wind chill)\n\nPittsburgh Steelers at Buffalo Bills — Sunday 1 p.m. EST in Orchard Park, N's Highmark Stadium (outdoor): 22 F (-7 F wind chill) with heavy and blowing snow\n\nGreen Bay Packers at Dallas Cowboys — Sunday 3:30 p.m. CST in Arlington's AT&T Stadium (retractable roof): 25 F\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Detroit Lions — Sunday 8 p.m. EST in Detroit's Ford Field (indoors): 9 F\n\nSnow piling up in the Midwest\n\nHeavy snow has started in the Midwest, with some areas already seeing more than a foot.\n\nFinland, Minn., had 17 inches as of this afternoon.\n\nIn Fairfield, Iowa, there is 11.5 inches of snow on the ground.\n\nWarner, Ill., has recorded 11 inches.\n\nQuad Cities, Ill., is dealing with 10.4 inches.\n\nThese totals could grow as heavy snow is set to continue in the Great Lakes region tonight with snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. The area will also face more than 40-mph wind gusts to continue the blizzardlike conditions.\n\nSnowfall totals from the weekend are set to be the highest in parts of northern Wisconsin and Michigan, where a whopping 12 to 18 inches — or more — is possible.\n\nExtreme weather, even by Montana's standards\n\nAt Big Mountain summit in northwest Montana this morning, the wind chill was negative 68 degrees, according to the National Weather Service out of Missoula.\n\nThe bad weather continues throughout the Northwest region of the state.\n\nVideo posted to social media shows heavy snow and high wind in Kalispell, as the conditions continue to worsen.\n\nWhat is a bomb cyclone?\n\nMeteorologists are labeling the sprawling storm moving across the central United States a “bomb cyclone,” but what does that term really mean?\n\nA bomb cyclone is essentially a storm that rapidly intensifies and undergoes a significant drop in air pressure. Specifically, a storm must drop at least 24 millibars over a 24-hour period to qualify as a bomb cyclone, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That definition can vary, however, depending on latitude.\n\nMillibars are units of measurement for atmospheric pressure inside a storm and are used to indicate a storm’s intensity.\n\nA storm can undergo \"bombogenesis\" when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, fueling the rapid intensification.\n\nAs the label suggests, bomb cyclones unleash an array of dangerous conditions, including blizzards, high winds and heavy snow.\n\nWeekend forecast: Wind, snow, ice and rain to affect millions\n\nSevere winter weather and a cold front brought wind chills of 52 below zero in Great Falls, Montana, and 29 below in Bismark, North Dakota, today, as the frigid air spears south toward Texas.\n\nFifty-four million people are under winter alerts with blizzard warnings in the Quad Cities through much of Iowa and into portions of South Dakota, as well southern portions of Idaho.\n\nSix inches of snow have already fallen in the Des Moines area; Chicago has seen two to four inches; and snowfall totals could reach around a foot in Milwaukee and upward, especially near lakefront areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the East Coast faces flooding threats with 35 million under flood watches and warnings.\n\nMap: The next 24 hours of wintry weather across the U.S.\n\nWinter weather is forecast to hit the breadth of the U.S., from Washington state to Maine. Track the potential disruptive impact of the weather in the coming 24 hours with this map, which updates automatically every two hours.\n\nChicago braces for below-zero temperatures and wind chills\n\nThe Windy City, no stranger to bitter winters, will be hit with the coldest weather of the season starting this weekend, officials said today.\n\nChicago Office of Emergency Management and Communication Executive Director Jose Tirado said the cold weather will hit tomorrow afternoon and will continue into next week. The cold front expected early Sunday into Wednesday will see below-zero temperatures and the possibility of -20 wind chills each morning from Sunday through Wednesday, he said.\n\nA winter storm warning is currently in effect through 5 p.m. local time and a blizzard warning has been issued for this evening until noon tomorrow, with heavy snow and mixed precipitation forecast, the National Weather Service said. Warming centers will be open across the city and motorists are warned to drive with caution.\n\nChicago Fire Commissioner Annette Nance-Holt told NBC Chicago, “We have not seen cold weather like this since 2019.”\n\nHochul to declare state of emergency in western N.Y., National Guard activated\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said that she has activated the National Guard ahead of an imminent winter storm that will hit the state, and that she will declare a state of emergency for western New York.\n\nAreas of significant focus are Buffalo and Watertown where lake-effect snow and strong winds will create blizzardlike conditions and low visibility off Lake Erie and Ontario tomorrow into Sunday. She said that 20 inches of snowfall is forecast for that region.\n\nHochul announced a travel ban on empty tractor trailers and tandem trucks from Rochester area to the Pennsylvania state line starting tomorrow at 9 a.m., citing how past storms have seen such trucks overturn, creating catastrophes on roads.\n\nEquipment is already being deployed and 100 National Guard members will arrive in western New York tomorrow morning. Generators have been put in place across the state ahead of the storm and warming centers will also be opened.\n\nIowa caucuses clash with wintry weather\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa — Republicans here were expecting a flurry of political activity in the closing days before Monday’s caucuses. Instead, they got a “life-threatening” blizzard that, along with bone-chilling temperatures, imperils voter turnout.\n\n“20 below [zero] is cold,” said Will Rogers, a former chairman of the Polk County GOP who plans to caucus for Haley. “It will keep people home on caucus night.”\n\nHe said he believes stay-inside temperatures will help Trump, who has a highly committed voter base and has led by dozens of points in every major recent poll of the state.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAbbott tells people to stay home; assures them power will stay on\n\nGov. Greg Abbott warned of “ultracold temperatures” forecast to sweep across Texas from tomorrow through Wednesday, but said the power grid will stay on throughout the freeze.\n\nAbbott’s assurance comes after Texas suffered a massive power crisis during extreme winter storms in February 2021 that saw millions of homes lose power and contributed to the deaths of 246 people.\n\nHe said that ERCOT’s grid and power sources were winterized, adding, \"They have never been as prepared for a winter event as they are today, including having a secondary source of fuel available.\"\n\nHe warned that there are two time periods that officials predict may be \"tight\" for power: Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning. Abbott urged people to prepare to stay home, avoid driving especially if precipitation comes down and creates icy roads, and said warming centers will be opened across the state.\n\nWeather alerts in effect in every U.S. state\n\nFrom blizzard warnings to tornado watches to widespread storm advisories, it's shaping up to be a wild weather day across the entire country.\n\nStates in the Midwest and the Great Lakes region are bracing for intense blizzard conditions, while a blast of Arctic air is sending temperatures plummeting in the Northwest and through parts of the Plains.\n\nHigh wind warnings are in effect for much of the eastern half of the country, and the weather service said tornadoes are possible in Mississippi and Tennessee as severe thunderstorms move through the Southeast.\n\n“A VERY active weather pattern, and EVERY state in the US has an active NWS Watch, Warning, or Advisory,” it said on X.\n\nChicago O'Hare Airport has delays of at least 2 hours as more than 10,000 flights delayed across U.S.\n\nChicago O'Hare International Airport is delaying all flights by at least two hours because of the freezing conditions, the Federal Aviation Administration said in an update early today.\n\nThe airport initiated a ground delay program, which will mean knock-on delays to flights will last into the evening and at least until 9 p.m. ET.\n\nEarlier, the airport ordered a ground stop and said that no flights would land or take off from the airport until at least 7.15 a.m.\n\nThe news comes amid widespread travel disruptions with more than 2,000 flight cancellations today so far and more than 10,000 delays, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.\n\nChicago set to beat last winter's snow total\n\nChicago could be about to break an astonishing weather record, with 10.7 inches of snow having fallen there already this season. If this current storm brings 9.6 inches or more, the city will have already received more than the 20.2 inches it got last winter.\n\nMeanwhile, in Iowa, 4.4 inches of snow has fallen today already at the weather service's center in Johnston, north of Des Moines.\n\nFreezing weather brings minus-39 conditions to Montana\n\nThe coldest temperature today was recorded at 7 a.m. ET near Salt Lake, Montana, where thermometers dropped to a frigid minus 39, according a preliminary reading from the weather service.\n\nThere is still some ways to go before reaching the record low temperature for Montana of minus 70, however.\n\nThe day's warmest temperature so far was a summery 88 degrees recorded at Faith Ranch Airport in Texas, southwest of San Antonio.\n\nBomb cyclone to bring severe weather and Arctic cold across U.S.\n\nand\n\nPeople across the country are bracing for more winter weather, with 35 million under a severe weather risk. As people in the West recover from deadly avalanches, more twisters and hail will hammer the South, while blizzards blanket the Midwest. NBC’s Maggie Vespa reports and the \"TODAY\" show’s Al Roker tracks the latest forecast.\n\nBelow-freezing temps in forecast for north Texas\n\nDALLAS — A strong cold front is expected to knock wind chills in the Dallas-Fort Worth area down into the teens and 20s this morning, according to the weather service.\n\nHighs will end up in the 40s and 50s today, but it will be windy ahead of the below-freezing temps forecast for later this weekend.\n\nOvernight Sunday into Monday, temperatures are expected in the low teens around Dallas, and in the single digits in other parts of north Texas, including Greenville and Cisco, according to the weather service.\n\nThough it's still days out, there's a chance Dallas could see a wintry mix or some snow Sunday into Monday, which could be enough to make roads iffy.\n\nEyes will also be on the state's power grid as it faces its first big test of the year. ERCOT, which operates 90% of the grid, said yesterday that there is \"not a current expectation of an energy emergency.\"\n\nEarly next week, Texas and the interior Southwest could see below-zero wind chills, according to the weather service.\n\nTahoe avalanche survivor describes being buried under the snow before his rescue\n\nand\n\nJason Parker was snowboarding at Palisades Tahoe on Wednesday when an avalanche erupted on the mountain, burying him underneath several feet of snow and killing one man.\n\nIt was the first day the KT-22 chairlift was open at the ski resort in Olympic Valley, California, and Parker and his fiancée both had a day off, so, despite the low visibility and strong winds, they decided to hit the slopes.\n\n“It was open, and we took advantage of it,” Parker, who lives just outside downtown Reno, told NBC News.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n1 man feared dead, 2 rescued from Idaho avalanche\n\nOne man is missing and presumed dead after an avalanche in Idaho yesterday, while two others were rescued and are recovering, authorities confirmed early today.\n\nThe Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office received a report of an avalanche near Steven’s Peak, via a GPS alert from a Garmin digital device, at 2.53 p.m. yesterday.\n\nUsing the GPS device, deputies were able to establish contact with and locate two of the missing men, who are now receiving medical care.\n\nDespite assistance from the U.S. Air Force, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office, Silver Valley Search and Rescue, and the Silver Mountain Ski Patrol, the search party could not find the third man.\n\n\"While debriefing the two males, we received information causing us to believe the third male was deceased at the site of the avalanche. Due to this information, we have concluded our search efforts for the safety of all those involved for this evening,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement early today.\n\nThe statement said a \"retrieval\" operation for the body of the third man would take place later this morning. The names of the three man have not been released.\n\nSteven’s Peak, a nearly 7,000-feet-tall mountain close to the border with Montana, is popular with hikers, skiers and climbers.\n\nA 66-year-old man died and several others were buried by an avalanche in Tahoe, California, on Wednesday.\n\nVideo: Wild winter weather forecast to continue across many areas\n\nNBC News meteorologist Angie Lassman tells \"Early Today\" what the weather has in store, where rain will lash the East and snow will blanket the Midwest.\n\nOregon bracing for snowy, windy cold snap\n\nOregon is bracing for a cold snap with heavy snow forecast in the Cascades today, according to the weather service.\n\nTomorrow, snow will linger in the mountains and the area in addition to the Columbia River Gorge and the Portland and Vancouver areas are expected to be hit with snow and gusty winds.\n\nThere's also the potential for blizzard conditions in the gorge, the weather service said.\n\nIowa State Patrol: This winter weather is life-threatening\n\nIowa’s statewide law enforcement agency warned residents that the winter weather hitting the Hawkeye State can be deadly.\n\n“In the interest of YOUR safety AND those working the roads, we STRONGLY advise everyone to refrain from ANY non-essential travel,” the Iowa State Highway Patrol said on X yesterday, calling it a “life-threatening winter weather alert.”\n\nAs much as 11 inches of snow may have fallen by 10 a.m. today, and then through tomorrow morning there will be blizzard conditions, it said. Tomorrow through Tuesday will have life-threatening cold with wind chills of as low as minus 45 degrees.\n\nJust after midnight into this morning, blizzard warnings covered most of Iowa, where the Iowa caucuses are set to start Monday.\n\nMore than 6 inches of snow is forecast to fall in the Milwaukee area today through tomorrow, the weather service said. Chicago is expected to get the coldest temperatures of the season starting Sunday, with wind chills of minus 30 at times, the weather service there said.\n\nGOP candidates unworried about Iowa turnout as they face record cold caucus temperatures\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa — Temperatures for the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses Monday are set to be the coldest in the contest’s modern history, with a forecast high temperature of around zero degrees in Des Moines, according to the weather service.\n\nBut Republican presidential candidates aren’t worried, uniformly saying they think their supporters are uniquely motivated to come out and vote the night of Jan. 15. And state party leaders also don’t think the frigid temperatures will affect the turnout.\n\nIowa Republican Party Chair Jeff Kaufmann said this week that barring severe weather, he doesn’t think the cold temperatures alone will drive caucusgoers away in large numbers.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nNew York residents urged to prepare for wind, rain and snow\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Buffalo has warned of a triple threat of wind, rain and snow.\n\nTemperatures will be a chilly 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit, far higher than in other parts of the country further west, but a high winds watch starts across the state from today.\n\n\"Taking it one day at a time, tomorrow will be fair, a good day to prepare outside before the winds ramp up tomorrow night, with these winds remaining very strong through Saturday,\" the weather service said.\n\nA number of cities may set records for coldest temperatures\n\nand\n\nA number of U.S. cities could set new daily cold records as temperatures across the country plummet into the weekend and early next week.\n\nMore than 60 cities might experience their coldest daily temperatures Monday and Tuesday morning, including the Texas cities of Austin, Dallas and Houston, as well as Little Rock, Arkansas; Jackson, Mississippi; and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nBelow-freezing temps expected to linger in Kansas City making for frigid Chiefs tailgate\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The snow piles from early in the week haven’t had a chance to melt yet, but neighbors better get used to ‘em.\n\nForecasters are calling for more snow today, but that’s only part of the brutal weather that awaits. Temps aren’t expected to climb above freezing for at least five days.\n\nIt isn’t just freezing temps we’re talking about; it’s record-setting, subzero lows that send a chill up your spine just from looking at the forecast. It’s the kind of extreme weather that calls for a sweater — and a coat — for little dogs that have to go outside.\n\nBut the weather isn’t the only thing that folks here are talking about: The Chiefs and their playoff hopes come up plenty, too. Never mind that it isn’t Patrick Mahomes or Chris Jones they’re talking about, it’s the frigid temps and what that means for barbecue tailgates outside Arrowhead.\n\nThe game kicks off at 7 p.m. tomorrow local time against the Miami Dolphins in minus 6 conditions (and that’s before you factor in the wind, then it will feel like minus 20). It could be the coldest home playoff game in the Chiefs’ history.\n\nIn temps that extreme, it's not clear that the team from the Heartland has a weather advantage over the Dolphins.\n\nWhat is a bomb cyclone?\n\nThe intense system that could bring severe storms, blizzard conditions and rain to parts of the U.S. is expected to reach the official criteria of a bomb cyclone.\n\nSo what is a bomb cyclone?\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSevere weather risk continues today across the country\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAn intense winter storm that hit the western United States last night is set to continue spreading into the Plains and the Midwest today, where it will strengthen considerably.\n\nThe storm will usher in the coldest air of the season to the northern Rockies, the Plains and the Midwest.\n\nBlizzard conditions are possible today in cities including St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Des Moines, Iowa; and Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nIn the South, a severe weather outbreak is possible from Mississippi to North Carolina with chances of strong tornadoes and wind gusts more than 75 mph.\n\nBy late tonight, heavy rain and wind will arrive in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast."
