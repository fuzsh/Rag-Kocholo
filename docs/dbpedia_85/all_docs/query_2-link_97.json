        "text": "WINTER STORM WARNING AND BLIZZARD WARNING IS CANCELLED.\n\nWINTER WEATHER ADVISORY is in effect until Sunday morning into the afternoon for lake-effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 8 inches with locally higher amounts possible. Winds gusting as high as 30-40 mph for portions of Northern Lower Michigan.\n\nWINTER WEATHER ADVISORY is in effect for Southeast Chippewa, Western Mackinac and Eastern Mackinac Counties, and Mackinac Island/Bois Blanc Island and Beaver Island and surrounding islands until noon Saturday for Snow and patchy blowing snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to two inches. Winds gusting as high as 30 mph.\n\nIn case of power outages:\n\nSATURDAY (JAN 13): Northern Michigan (and much of the state) will be in a massive winter storm. Snow (heavy at times) will carry over from Friday night through Saturday subsiding some Saturday afternoon/evening. Total snowfall will vary but in general, more is expected along/east of Interstate-75. The other contributing factor to this storm will be the strong wind. Wind Friday night into Saturday will turn from the NE to the North with gusts in the 35-50 mph range with extensive blowing/drifting of snow. Travel will be a rough if not no go Saturday for parts of the region. Late in the day as our storm departs colder air will work across the Great Lakes igniting lake effect snow downwind of Lakes Superior/Michigan. High temperatures from 15-29F. NE-NW wind gusting 35+ mph.\n\nSUNDAY (JAN 14): Our storm will depart but the coldest weather all season long sweeps in kicking up lake effect snow which could be heavy at times Sunday in the usual snowbelt areas with a northwest wind crossing the Great Lakes. Away from the snowbelts, some snow remains possible but the weather should improve from a travel standpoint. Highs Sunday from 17-19F. NW wind gusting to 30 mph.\n\nMONDAY (JAN 15): Lake effect snow carries over into Monday (MLK DAY) but across the U.P. we may get a break with some sunshine possible. Away from the snowbelts we may also get a break in some of the snow. A chilly afternoon with high temperatures from 13-18F\n\nStorm preps:\n\nEXTENDED FORECAST: High temperatures will remain in the teens Sunday-Tuesday with wind chill readings going below zero in spots. With the Great Lakes wide open (little to no ice) and warmer than usual lake temperatures lake effect snow will continue at times most of next week as that cold air works across the lakes. All in all a very active stretch of winter weather on the way for Northern Michigan.\n\n-Meteorologist Joe Charlevoix"
