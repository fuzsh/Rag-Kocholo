        "text": "It's November and Michigan already is seeing snow in the midst of the fall color season.\n\nA winter weather advisory is in effect until 2 p.m. Tuesday for northern lower Michigan with up to 4 inches of snow expected to accumulate in the region.\n\nAntrim, Otsego, Montmorency, Kalkaska, Crawford, and Oscoda counties are to be affected by this snowfall.\n\nIn metro Detroit, there's a chance of rain and snow showers Tuesday with a high of 46 degrees and freezing temperatures overnight, with a low of 32 degrees, according to the National Weather Service in White Lake.\n\nTemperatures aren't expected to crack the 50-degree mark again until Friday.\n\nMore: There's a snowplow, salt truck driver shortage in Michigan: What it means for roads\n\nMore: How crafty scammers try to get you all stressed out\n\nSabrina Jauernic, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service Gaylord Michigan office, said the snow is caused by a combination of the warm temperatures of the lakes and cold air.\n\n“The lakes are right around 14 degrees Celsius&mldr; in Fahrenheit, that would be around 57 or 58 degrees. The temperatures that are in the lowest levels of the atmosphere are anywhere from 15 to 20 degrees colder than the lake surface temperatures, and that difference is causing the air to pick up some heat and moisture. That’s going to be kind of just dumping all of that moisture out in the form of snow.”\n\nPeople traveling in the affected areas are cautioned to drive carefully since it is the first snow of the season with accumulation, the advisory said. “Wetter” and “greasy” road conditions are to be expected.\n\nTonight, Detroit has both a 20% chance of showers and a 20% chance of a mixture of rain and snow. By Tuesday, there will be partly cloudy skies and a high of 46 degrees."
