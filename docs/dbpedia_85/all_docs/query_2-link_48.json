        "text": "Last weekend, the Northland got a round snowfall that made outdoor enthusiasts very happy. To kick off this week, areas south of the Twin Ports area received even more snow, which led to a series of Winter Storm Warnings being issued throughout the areas of impact.\n\nNow, it appears it's once again the Northland's turn to get more snow, with snowfall amounts over 10 inches possible in some areas. The National Weather Service in Duluth issued both a Winter Storm Warning and a Winter Weather Advisory Wednesday in preparation for the winter storm.\n\nWhile the Duluth area is currently in the Winter Weather Advisory area, the National Weather Service noted that the advisory has the potential to be upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning as they track the storm pattern.\n\nTHURSDAY UPDATE: By noon on Thursday, the original Winter Weather Advisory for the Duluth area was no longer in effect but there will be snow into the weekend. However, the Winter Storm Warning in Southern Lake County was extended into Thursday night.\n\nAlso worth noting, the Winter Storm Warning that was recently issued for Southern Cook County was extended into Friday morning and a new Winter Storm Warning was issued to include two additional counties.\n\nWinter Storm Warning #1\n\nThe Winter Winter Storm Warning for Southern Lake County has been extended to 9:00 p.m. on Thursday, January 11.\n\nHere is what is still expected in the area:\n\nWhat: Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of up to 4 inches.\n\nWhere: Southern Lake County, including the cities of Two Harbors and Silver Bay.\n\nImpacts: Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous conditions could impact the evening commute.\n\nAdditional Details: The greatest snow totals will be found in the higher elevation areas from near Silver Bay to Finland to Murphy City northeastward to the Cook County line.\n\nWinter Storm Warning #2 (New)\n\nWhat started Thursday morning as a Winter Weather Advisory has been escalated to a Winter Storm Warning for Southern Cook County. It's in effect now until Noon on Friday, January 12.\n\nWhat: Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 6 inches.\n\nWhere: Southern Cook County. This includes the city of Grand Marais as well as the Tribal Lands of the Grand Portage Reservation.\n\nImpacts: Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the evening commute.\n\nAdditional Details: The greatest snow totals will be found in the higher elevation areas from Eagle Mountain and Devil Track Lake southwestward to the Lake County line.\n\nWinter Storm Warning #3 (New)\n\nJust before noon Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a new Winter Storm Warning to include Northern Cook and Northern Lake Counties, where the most new accumulations of snow may occur. It's in effect now until 3:00 a.m. on Friday, January 12.\n\nWhat: Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 8 inches.\n\nWhere: Northern Cook and Lake County\n\nImpacts: Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the evening commute.\n\nAdditional Details: The greatest snow totals will be found in the higher terrain areas along the Lake and Cook county lines including Whyte, Isabella, Murphy City, Sawbill Landing, and Eagle Mountain.\n\nThe National Weather Service also shared a Facebook post relating to this storm which included a series of graphics. The first of which highlighted the forecast snowfall amounts from the first round.\n\nA second graphic shows the localized North Shore snowfall totals.\n\nThe NWS also shared a graphic highlighting the forecast snowfall amounts from round 2.\n\nSee Now: Sold!
