        "text": "Here we snow again!\n\nWhile cliche, it is 100% true as West Michigan gets ready for another dose of the white stuff from Mother Nature and courtesy of Lake Michigan.\n\nA general two to three inches starts prior to midnight, lasting through lunchtime on Friday, Jan. 19, 2024. The timing, obviously, is not great for the Friday morning commute.\n\nDue to a relative warm-up in the last 24-36 hours, there's a higher moisture content in this upcoming snowfall, and extra moisture means less traction for your vehicle on our area roads.\n\nSnow increases throughout West Michigan toward midnight and definitely into the wee hours of Friday morning.\n\nA Winter Storm Warning and Winter Weather Advisories are already in effect for Berrien county and Cass, St. Joe, and Branch counties respectively.\n\nWhile the Warning cautions about a foot or more of lake effect snow and severely impacted visibility in the vicnity of the powerful lake effect band, Winter Weather Advisories speak to lighter amounts of snow and still slippery travel. We suspect our I-94 counties and even Allegan, Barry counties go under Winter Weather Advisories later this afternoon.\n\nLake effect snow eventually shifts inland later Friday night and into Saturday morning as winds become northwesterly. This shift provides light accumulations of lake effect snow that may not taper off til late Saturday or Saturday evening.\n\nAway from any lake effect snow, temperatures may make a run toward zero degrees Saturday morning if there's enough clearing. Further, wind chills may plummet toward -15 degrees when already cold air and gusty winds are both taken into consideration."
