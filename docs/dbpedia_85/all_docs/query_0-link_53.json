        "text": "Coastal storms threaten human safety in western Alaskan communities, where a combination of complex geography, highly energetic atmospheric and ocean circulation, wind, waves, and an extensive coastal floodplain leave them highly vulnerable to hazardous flooding. Western Alaska is limited in weather observations and replete of nearshore current and circulation information, leaving regional forecasters and the communities they serve severely limited in their ability to assess the impact risk of storm events. These problems have become even more vexing in light of continued diminishing ice conditions in the fall and winter months, when the most intense storm events occur.\n\nA team of scientists from the Alaska Ocean Observing System, Axiom Data Science, CIGLR, NOAA, University of Notre Dame, and University of Texas-Austin to deliver improved storm surge, wave, and ice forecasting capacity to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Protection (NCEP) and NOAA National Ocean Service (NOS). Funding from the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is supporting the development of an integrated modeling system for the coasts of Alaska. The end product from this project is the coupled surge-wave-ice model for the western Alaska region, with the goal to provide forecast officers with model forecast guidance they can use to issue or not issue warnings and advisories.\n\nTheir advanced sea ice modeling system, based on the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE), will enable detailed representation of nearshore and offshore sea ice behavior such as landfast ice and increased surface roughness due to ridged ice, which impact surge and wave intensity. Currently, the team of scientists at CIGLR and NOAA GLERL leads the advancement of a sea ice model component based on CICE. Adequately depicting these processes is critical for accurate storm surge forecasting when the ocean is covered with ice. Thus far in the project, a standalone sea ice model has been successfully designed and verified using sensitivity studies and satellite measurements. The team continues to couple sea ice modeling components with the other physical modeling components like ocean and wave models, using the NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS) in collaboration with scientists at the University of Notre Dame, the University of Texas-Austin, and the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction. This project represents a major advancement in forecasting capacity to protect western Alaska communities and our lessons learned can be applied to ice-prone coastal regions elsewhere.\n\nLake Champlain is an international body of water, spanning the border between the United States and Canada. It is located in a steep mountain valley, with the Adirondack Mountains of New York to the west and the Green Mountains of Vermont to the east. This mountainous setting, while picturesque, is an environment highly conducive to springtime flooding. As temperatures warm, rapid snow melt from the mountains along with spring showers can lead to sudden rises in the lake’s water levels. Lake Champlain has experienced several such flood events over the past decade, causing destruction of property and infrastructure in the binational basin. The largest of these occurred in 2011, during which time the basin remained flooded for a period of more than two months.\n\nTo better anticipate and prepare for flood events, researchers at CIGLR are working with NOAA GLERL and the International Joint Commission (IJC) to develop a state-of-the-art flood forecasting model. The model is being developed in close collaboration with the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and emergency managers, who will use results from the Lake Champlain forecasting system to provide advance warning of floods to residents and other area stakeholders. The model starts with a detailed 3D representation of Lake Champlain, and uses physics to predict how water will move through the lake in response to outside forces such as river inflows and local meteorology. By feeding up-to-date weather and river forecasts into the model, researchers are able to predict how the lake will respond to future conditions, and produce 5-day forecasts of water levels, currents, and waves for the lake. These forecasts will improve the ability to plan and prepare for floods and, ultimately, reduce the severity of their impacts.\n\nThe accuracy, or skill, of the Lake Champlain forecast model was tested by simulating events that have already occurred, such as the record flood of 2011. Results from these “hindcast” simulations showed strong agreement with historic measurements that were taken in the lake at the time of the floods. The proven ability of the model to realistically simulate past flood events gives the researchers a high degree of confidence that it is capable of forecasting future events. The new flood forecasting model will be capable of resolving how flood conditions vary from location to location across Lake Champlain, which represents a major upgrade from existing tools used for forecasting in the basin. While we think of flooding as an influx of water, forces such as wind can significantly enhance the damage caused by flooding. Lake Champlain is only 14 miles wide from east to west, but is more than 100 miles long from north to south. When a strong wind blows over this long stretch of open water, it can “push” the water toward one end of the lake and also produce large waves on the surface. The ability to predict these wind driven impacts in addition to high lake levels is critical for understanding not just when the lake may flood, but where impacts may be most severe. Although the focus of the study is on flood forecasting, results from the model may benefit a variety of interests, such as boater safety, fishing, beachgoing, and scientific research.\n\nMany lakes and streams in the Great Lakes and upper Midwest region experience water quality issues related to agricultural runoff, some of which can be prevented by carefully timed decisions by farmers and applicators. When nutrients are applied during a period when the risk of surface runoff is high, nutrients intended to enrich the soil can end up in the water instead. Farmers lose revenue as their fertilizers wash away and crop yields suffer, while local and downstream waterways experience serious water quality consequences.\n\nThe water quality impacts of nutrient runoff have significantly been observed in the western basin of Lake Erie, which receives nutrient-laden water from watersheds dominated by agriculture (60-80 percent) and several large cities like Detroit, Toledo, and Monroe. Once in Lake Erie, the excess nutrients, along with the warm and shallow waters, create the perfect environment for the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs) which plague the lake annually.\n\nIn 2008, NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC) developed a real-time decision support tool to help guide the timing of fertilizer application based on current conditions and weather forecasts. Currently, the tools are being used in the upper Midwest including Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio, with ongoing efforts in New York, Indiana, and Illinois. The Ohio State University’s College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) are evaluating how water quality in the Maumee River and western Lake Erie may improve when farmers and fertilizer applicators use the decision support tools. The team is using watershed models to simulate different surface runoff scenarios by altering the timing of fertilizer application.\n\nThe NOAA National Water Model (NWM) is a hydrologic model that simulates observed and forecasted streamflow over the entire continental United States (CONUS). The model framework operates by using the hydrological version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Hydro) to simulate components of the water balance, including soil conditions, precipitation, and runoff, at a very fine-scale resolution. Hydrologists from CIGLR and GLERL are working with the NCRFC, as well as collaborators from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), to assess NWM ability to simulate surface runoff as well as develop an improved runoff risk tool that would incorporate real-time forecasts from the NWM. Transitioning to this next version of decision support tools hopes to improve the accuracy of runoff risk forecasts as well as having the benefits of using a continuously improving and operationally supported hydrologic model.\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to improve runoff risk decision support tools which would hopefully lead to a more widespread, voluntary use from states and other stakeholders. Not only would farmers and producers save money and efforts by avoiding nutrient application before significant runoff events, but help reduce the amount of nutrient runoff from reaching large bodies of water, such as the Great Lakes. Water quality benefits from lower nutrient loads include reductions in harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in receiving water bodies.\n\nAlves, J.H., A. Chawla, H.L. Tolman, D.J. Schwab, G.A.
