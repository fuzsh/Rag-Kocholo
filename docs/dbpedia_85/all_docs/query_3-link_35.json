        "meta_description": "Abstract Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, radar, and radiosonde data were examined to determine how frequently lake-effect storms (rain/snow) with lightning occurred over and near the lower Great Lakes region (Lakes Erie and Ontario) from September 1995 through March 2007. On average, lake-effect lightning occurred on 7.9 days and with 5.8 storm events during a particular cool season (September–March). The CG lightning with these storms had little inland extent and was usually limited to a few flashes per storm. Some storms had considerably more, with the most intense storm (based on National Lightning Detection Network observations) producing 1551 CG flashes over a 4-day period. Thundersnow events were examined in more detail because of the rarity of this phenomenon across the United States. Most lake-effect thundersnow events (75%) occurred in November and December. An analysis of model sounding data using the Buffalo Toolkit for Lake Effect Snow (BUFKIT) software package in which lower boundary conditions can be modified by lake surfaces showed that thundersnow events had an 82% increase in the mean height of the −10°C level when compared with nonelectrified lake-effect snowstorms (1.2 vs 0.7 km AGL), had higher lake-induced equilibrium levels (EL; above 3.6 km AGL) and convective available potential energy (CAPE; >500 J kg−1), had low wind shear environments, and were intense, single-band storms. A nomogram of the altitude of the −10°C isotherm and EL proved to be useful in predicting lake-effect thundersnowstorms.",

        "text": "a. Climatological study\n\nDates (defined as a day’s time period from 0000 to 2359 UTC) with CG lightning flashes in lake-effect storms were determined through a multiple-step elimination process. NLDN (Cummins et al. 2006) data were analyzed to determine days with CG lightning between 1995 and 2007. These data were obtained from Vaisala, Inc. The current NLDN only measures CG lightning flashes whose median location accuracy over the Great Lakes region is better than 500 m, and the flash detection efficiency is greater than 90% (Cummins et al.). Even though the NLDN has been in operation since 1989, limitations in archived Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data prevented analysis before 1995 [all of the Next-Generation Doppler Radar (NEXRAD) network radars were not online until the mid-1990s]. Days with CG flashes that occurred from September through March, which we defined as the lake-effect season, were retained. The domain included the lower Great Lakes (Lakes Erie and Ontario, eastern Lake Huron, and the Georgian Bay) and surrounding land areas (from 40.3° to 45.5°N and from 83.75° to 75.0°W). Once dates with CG lightning from September through March were determined, radar base reflectivity imagery (NCDC 2007) from each of these days was used to filter out dates without lake-effect storms. Days associated with obvious non-lake-effect features (e.g., thunderstorm squall lines) were eliminated from the dataset. Dates with radar imagery that showed banded precipitation (rain, graupel, snow) originating over the lower Great Lakes and aligned with the low-level wind flow were retained. It was impossible to determine whether a lake-effect storm occurred on some of the dates with lightning because of limitations of the archived radar imagery from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Internet site [e.g., low spatial resolution of 4 km for the reflectivity fields and missing data (sometimes only one image was available per day)]; these dates remained in the dataset as well. We did not disregard days on which lightning occurred near the lakes and the environment was supportive of lake-effect convection (see below) just because there was a lack of available radar data. We diagnosed 9 days (about one-tenth of the lake-effect lightning total sample size) with lake-effect lightning when high spatial/temporal resolution radar data were not available.\n\nThe remaining lake-effect events needed to meet the following criteria to be considered part of the climatological dataset: 1) there was little to no wind shear in the lowest tropospheric levels (up to 700 hPa) as estimated from nearby rawinsonde observations, 2) the temperature difference between the lake surface and the 850-hPa level was >13°C, and 3) CG lightning observations were located within 50 km of the Great Lakes. The latter criterion was used to remove lightning events associated with cold-frontal passages, and the temperature criterion is a well-accepted threshold for the occurrence of lake-effect precipitation (Wiggin 1950, Holroyd 1971). Lake surface mean temperatures were obtained from GLERL (2007).\n\nb. Lake-effect thundersnow\n\nLake-effect snowstorms (the previous methods applied to lake-effect lightning that occurred with any precipitation type) that occurred on Lakes Erie and Ontario were examined for the presence of lightning from the winters of 1995/96 through 2006/07. The lake-effect snowstorms in this part of the study were defined as producing at least 17.8 cm (7 in.) of snow in 12 h. This snowfall accumulation is used by the National Weather Service (NWS) Eastern Region to define lake-effect winter storms for the NWS Buffalo County Warning Area (National Weather Service 2005). Nearly 200 lake-effect snow events were identified over Lakes Erie and Ontario. Because synoptic snow events were excluded from this dataset, forcing from organized midtropospheric short waves and frontal passages was excluded.\n\nThe thermal profiles used in this part of the study were supplied by simulated (forecast) proximity soundings from the operational Eta/Weather Research and Forecasting- Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM) binary universal form for the representation of meteorological data (BUFR) data for Buffalo, Jamestown, Rochester, Watertown, and Syracuse, New York. BUFR is a World Meteorological Organization standard for storing data, including upper-air information (Alpert 2008). BUFR data contain the native-vertical-resolution, uninterpolated model output. Because this format can store a large amount of data and metadata in a small amount of disk space, it is ideal for using in programs such as BUFKIT (Mahoney and Niziol 1997), in which it can be read in its native format. The initial model time (0000 or 1200 UTC) for the BUFKIT analyses was the time immediately prior to the lightning observations or, in the case of no lightning, the time prior to the most unstable (e.g., environmental lapse rates approaching dry neutral) forecast period of the lake-effect event. We used mean lake surface temperatures from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL 2007) and the Erie County Water Authority for Lake Erie to modify the Eta/WRF-NMM BUFR model input through the equations given in Phillips (1972) to better represent lake boundary layer conditions (usually warmer and more moist than the original model data). Hence, the use of BUFKIT enabled a more realistic CAPE value to be calculated over the lake. Simulated lake-induced CAPE calculations in BUFKIT incorporate heat and moisture fluxes into the boundary layer from an underlying lake surface. In this case, the waters of Lakes Erie and Ontario add potential energy to the parcel. We chose parameter values, such as the lake-induced CAPE, nearest in time to the onset of lightning for each event. For activity near Lake Erie, the Buffalo data were analyzed; near Lake Ontario, Watertown/Rochester data were used depending on band proximity to each location. When there was no lightning reported for an event (i.e., nonlightning event), the highest value of CAPE during the lake-effect storm event was used.\n\nThe lightning data were obtained from two main sources, with the majority of the information being gathered from reports from volunteer snow spotters. The second source was the NLDN. The National Weather Service in Buffalo started an extensive snow-spotter network in the mid-1990s (Fig. 1). This network was developed to better define and verify lake-effect snowfall in real time. Over 200 snow spotters were asked to report snowfall amounts and rates in given time increments and, in addition, were asked to report the occurrence of any lightning and thunder. These reports included intracloud (IC) and CG lightning flashes. Additional CG lightning-strike information was obtained from the NLDN. When possible, these lightning reports were compared with the Buffalo (KBUF) and Montague (KTYX), New York, radars for 35-dBZ echo verification (Gremillion and Orville 1999; Hodanish et al. 2004). This assisted in distinguishing between nighttime lightning and possible power-line or transformer flashes.\n\nb. Lake-effect thundersnow\n\nThe vast majority of the 43 lake-effect thundersnow events examined over Lakes Erie and Ontario occurred early in the cold season. Nearly 75% of the thundersnows occurred in November and December, coinciding with the time of warmest lake surface temperatures (Fig. 4). Conversely, thundersnows were infrequent during the second half of the meteorological winter (beyond 15 January), with less than 10% of all cataloged events taking place during this period (Fig. 5).\n\nThe average lake surface temperature was 16% higher for lake-effect snow events that produced lightning than it was for nonlightning events. Greater than 70% of the lake-effect thundersnows examined occurred with lake temperatures at or above 10°C, and only 10% occurred when lake temperatures were below 4°C. Lake Erie typically freezes over by mid-February (Fig. 4) because of the shallowness of the lake. This partially explains the abundance of lightning during early-season events over Lake Erie, but similar results were also observed over Lake Ontario, which remains largely unfrozen throughout the entire winter.\n\nModified observed and forecast proximity soundings from Buffalo, Jamestown, Rochester, Syracuse, and Watertown, New York, showed that lake-effect thundersnow events were more associated with a warmer lower troposphere. This finding is similar to that of Schultz (1999) for lake-effect snowstorms in northern Utah and western New York. The three parameters used in identifying the warmer lower troposphere were the height of the lake-induced EL and the altitudes of the −10° and −20°C levels. The lake-induced EL is the height at which a lake-modified parcel will stop accelerating upward and can serve as a proxy for storm cloud top.\n\nThe −10°C isotherm level was examined because it has been identified as the most effective location for graupel initiation (Fukuta and Takahashi 1999), whereas the layer from 0° to −10°C is the most efficient zone for graupel growth through active riming (Staudenmaier 1999). A deeper layer from the surface to −10°C is important because it contains a higher concentration of supercooled water droplets, which is very favorable for riming on preexisting ice crystals. Graupel, ice crystals, and supercooled water droplets are essential ingredients in separating electrical charge in convective clouds (Takahashi 1978; Deierling et al. 2006).\n\nBased on the Eta/WRF-NMM BUFR lake-modified soundings, the average estimated height of the −10°C isotherm for lake-effect snowstorms with lightning was 1.2 km AGL and the mean height was 0.7 km for nonlightning events. This difference is statistically significant (at the p = 0.05 significance level) and represents an 82% increase. Lake-effect thundersnow events were associated with a deeper layer whose temperature was greater than −10°C, which is significant in terms of the microphysics and the development of graupel as noted above. Likewise, lake-effect thundersnow soundings had a deeper layer from the surface to −20°C by an average of 25% in comparison with soundings associated with events that did not produce lightning (mean −20°C isotherm heights of >3 vs 2.4 km, respectively).\n\nLake-effect thundersnow events had a deeper convective cloud layer than those events without lightning. The lake-induced EL, calculated by incorporating the lake surface temperature into the simulated thermal profile with BUFKIT, was used to estimate potential cloud depth. The average modified (lake induced) equilibrium level for lightning events was 37% greater than for nonlightning events (statistically significant at the p = 0.05 level), with elevations typically higher than 3.6 km AGL.\n\nIn addition to the thermal profiles of the lake-effect thundersnow events being “warmer” than their nonlightning counterparts, they also were associated with greater instability. The effects of heat and moisture fluxes from the lake surface were incorporated into the sounding with BUFKIT. We believe this has resulted in a more realistic analysis of stability values than those of Schultz (1999). The mean lake-induced CAPE value for the thundersnow events was 550 J kg−1, approximately 30% greater than the CAPE associated with the events that did not produce lightning.\n\nA small wind shear environment allows the lake-effect convection to become more concentrated. The latent heating within the cloud and the lake-effect band’s convective and mesoscale vertical motions can be better organized, which leads to an intense band with less shear (Niziol et al. 1995). Given a warm and deep enough convective boundary layer, a flow in all of the low levels of the troposphere that is nearly parallel to the long axis of an underlying lake can produce a single plume of heavy lake-effect thundersnow (Niziol et al.).\n\nNearly all of the thundersnow events found over Lakes Erie and Ontario from 1995 through 2007 were associated with intense single bands of snow (type 1; Niziol et al. 1995). Over Lake Erie, bands of lake-effect thundersnow typically occurred when the prevailing low-layer (e.g., 950–850-hPa mean) wind direction was between 240° and 270°, whereas 270°–290° was most favorable for Lake Ontario (see Fig. 6). These orientations result in the greatest residence time and fetch (distance that air travels over the water) for the convective elements over each lake, respectively, which allows for maximum heat and moisture transfer from the lake surface to the atmosphere and the development of intense single lake-effect bands. According to Fig. 6, the nonlightning events [which were still intense, producing >15.2 cm (6 in.) of snow in 12 h; see section 2b] were associated with wind directions that were more veered (more westerly for Lake Erie and more northwesterly for Lake Ontario) than those associated with the lightning events. These wind directions are more likely to produce weaker single and multiple bands of snow (type 2; Niziol et al. 1995) because they result in less fetch and hence less of a chance for lightning.\n\nThe strong low-level convergence that focuses the lake convection into a single band also maximizes the instability and lake flux interactions. This was an important variable that typically discriminated between very unstable lake-effect snow profiles that produced lightning and those that did not. The clustering of NLDN and surface spotter reports of CG lightning flashes at the east ends of both Lakes Erie and Ontario supports the importance of single-banded storms forming parallel to the long lake axis in producing lake-effect thunderstorms. For example, little if any CG lightning was found along the south shore of Lake Ontario in the Rochester metropolitan area, whereas lake-effect thundersnow events were fairly common in the Buffalo metropolitan area and between the Lake Ontario shoreline and the Tug Hill Plateau (see Figs. 1 and 2). The lack of CG flashes more than 45 km inland of the shores of both lakes also points to the importance of heat and moisture fluxes. Our reanalysis of more than 10 yr of lake-effect snowstorms, using archived radar, satellite, model, and snow-spotter data, coupled with the forecast experience of the second author (RH) in the Buffalo National Weather Service Forecast Office (NWSFO), revealed a very strong correlation between the thundersnow events and lake-effect band type 1 as categorized by Niziol et al. (1995).\n\nAnother interesting finding was the presence of lightning within 1 h of graupel being reported at the surface. Whereas graupel was not often reported during a lake-effect thundersnow event, lightning and thunder often accompanied the occurrence of graupel. This was yet another benefit provided by the NWS Buffalo snow-spotter network.\n\nc. Case studies\n\nFigure 7 shows the CG flash density for a historic early-season lake-effect snowstorm that affected Buffalo during 12–13 October 2006 (Buffalo NWSFO 2007). In addition to the unusual amount of snowfall for this time of year (maximum report of >60 cm), this lake-effect storm was anomalously electrified (at least 185 CG flashes were reported in Fig. 7). The forecast maximum lake-induced CAPE according to the WRF-NMM BUFKIT (from the cycle initialized at 0000 UTC 13 October using a lake temperature of 17°C) for Buffalo was 2400 J kg−1 at 0200 UTC 13 October; at this time the lake-induced EL was 7.3 km AGL. The layer from −10° to −25°C (the favorable zone for graupel and ice crystal production) was within the lake-effect cloud layer from initialization (0000 UTC) until approximately 1600 UTC 13 October (Fig. 8). By 1600 UTC, the lake-effect band had drifted north of Buffalo and weakened. The National Weather Service in Buffalo reported that there was lightning for a period of more than 12 h during this storm.\n\nThe 3–12 February 2007 lake-effect snowstorm was not as electrically active as the historic 12–13 October 2006 storm. However, several flashes were witnessed by students and faculty at the State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY Oswego). Because of limitations in archived BUFKIT data, we focused on the 0000 UTC 5 February WRF-NMM run for a central Lake Ontario location (43.65°N, 77.38°W) using a lake temperature of 3.3°C. Lake-induced CAPE reached a maximum of 1790 J kg−1 at 0500 UTC 5 February, with a lake-induced EL of 5.3 km AGL (Table 1); however, at that time the layer from −10° to −25°C was not within the convective cloud layer. From 1200 to 1500 UTC on 5 February, the layer from −10° to −25°C was within the convective cloud layer; it was during this time that lightning was observed on the SUNY Oswego campus (see Fig. 1 for location).\n\nFor the null case, 28–31 January 2004, we used the WRF-NMM run for the central Lake Ontario location initialized at 1200 UTC 29 January. The lake temperature was 2.8°C. Forecast lake-induced CAPE peaked at 845 J kg−1 at 1300 UTC 29 January, with a lake-induced EL of 3.7 km AGL (see Table 1). The layer from −10° to −25°C was within the lake-effect cloud layer from 1200 to 1500 UTC 29 January; however, no lightning was observed during this time by the NLDN and NWS weather spotters.\n\nb. Case studies and forecasting implications\n\nA layer from −10° to −25°C within the lake-effect convective cloud layer appears to be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for lightning occurrence with lake-effect storms, based on the three cases shown (and others not discussed in this paper). We speculate that the lower instability (shown by lake-induced CAPE) present during the 28–31 January 2004 storm was not sufficient for enough charge separation to initiate lightning, despite the presence of a mixed-phase cloud. Although Schultz (1999) concluded that there is little or no CAPE observed in lake-effect storms, BUFKIT software allows the user to input lake surface temperature and modify model data to account for lake-induced CAPE to allow an approximation of the thermodynamic conditions near and within snowbands forming over a lake.\n\nThe lake-effect thundersnow events examined show a clear relationship with deep warmer lower-tropospheric layers. These results are similar to Schultz’s (1999) findings, but advances in thermal-profile diagnostic software (e.g., BUFKIT) enabled a more realistic examination in this study of the lower boundary layer and its interaction with the underlying lake surface. The warmer lakewater of the early winter season helps to deepen the favorable layer from 0° to −10°C by adding heat and moisture to the lowest levels of the boundary layer. A warmer lower troposphere can result in a greater abundance of graupel, which aids in the separation of electrical charge.\n\nThe results of this study confirm that most of the thundersnow events occur during November and December when the lake surfaces are at their warmest of the cold season. As stated by Kristovich and Laird (1998), the magnitudes of heat and moisture fluxes from the surface of the lakes (these fluxes are greater early in the season) greatly influence the growth rate of the convective boundary layer. The warmer profiles also correspond with higher −20°C and lake-induced equilibrium levels. These are both indicators of a deeper mixed-phase cloud region, which can allow for sufficient charge separation to occur.\n\nThe lake-effect snowstorms that did not produce any lightning were 37% shallower than their counterparts. Lightning events were associated with lake-induced equilibrium levels in excess of 3.6 km AGL. These observations are supported by Niziol (1987), who showed that lightning and thunder accompanied heavy lake-effect snowfall occurring with inversion heights of greater than 3 km.\n\nWith respect to atmospheric instability, modified thermal profiles show that lake-effect thundersnow events are more likely when the lake-induced CAPE values are in excess of 500 J kg−1. These values are approximately 30% larger than for lake-effect snow events without lightning. Nearly 100% of the events with lake-induced CAPE values in excess of 1000 J kg−1 produced lightning. Hence, significant convective vertical motion in the presence of a mixed-phase lake-effect cloud is integral to separating electrical charge to the point of initiating lightning. Lake-induced CAPE was not used in earlier studies (e.g., Schultz 1999) because of the inability to incorporate the effects of heat and moisture fluxes from the lake surface into observational and model sounding data (e.g., soundings were taken over land).\n\nA nomogram was developed based on our findings (Fig. 10) that was experimentally used to forecast the occurrence of lightning within lake-effect snowstorms during the 2006/07 winter season. The nomogram uses two main variables: the height of the −10°C level as the x axis and the height of the lake-induced EL as the y axis. The height of the −10°C level was used to represent the availability of graupel sufficient for separating electrical charge and producing lightning within the mixed-phase region of the cloud. The height of the lake-induced EL was found to best represent convective cloud depth that can allow for charge separation. Given a single plume of lake-effect snow, these two variables were found to work best in a basic two-element nomogram for the prediction of thundersnow. Various other parameters were examined during the development of the nomogram, but none were able to make as clear of a distinction between events that contained lightning and those that did not as do the parameters used in Fig. 10. These other parameters included CAPE, depth of the convective cloud, depth of the mixed-phase region (the layer from −10° to −25°C) within the cloud, shear, and wind direction (fetch length). The use of mixing ratio or surface dewpoint temperature may have proven to be more useful, but reliable values for these parameters over the lake surfaces were not available in our data.\n\nThe nomogram was tested in the Buffalo National Weather Service Forecast Office during the winter of 2006/07 with favorable results (Fig. 11). Four out of five lake-effect events that were in the “likely” portion of the nomogram produced lightning, and two out of nine events in the “chance” section contained lightning. All of the remaining events in the “not expected” portion of the nomogram occurred without producing any reported (spotter and NLDN) lightning.\n\nThe wide range of values associated with lightning events within the chance section of the nomogram shows that a greater understanding is needed about the development of lightning within lake-effect snowbands. The future implementation of total lightning detection systems [ground and satellite based, e.g., the planned Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) program] and improvements in numerical modeling (e.g., higher resolution and improved microphysics schemes) will lead to better forecast methods."
