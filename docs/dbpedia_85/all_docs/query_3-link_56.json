        "text": "A prolonged lake-effect snow event is forecast around the Great Lakes through at least Jan. 17. Multiple bands of heavy snowfall and strong winds are likely to impact the region over the coming days, which may lead to blizzard conditions in some locations. Snowfall accumulations of up to 70 cm (28 inches) are possible in lakeside areas during the duration of the event. Hazardous driving conditions are likely due to icy roads and reduced visibility caused by blowing and drifting snow. Sporadic power outages may occur in affected areas.\n\nEnvironment Canada has issued red snow squall warnings (the highest level on a three-tier scale) for parts of southern Ontario and a red extreme cold temperature warning for southern parts of the Ontario Peninsula. Yellow snow squall watches and special weather statements have also been issued across other parts of southern Ontario.\n\nThe US National Weather Service (NWS) has issued winter storm warnings and watches for parts of northern and western New York. Winter weather advisories have been issued for parts of central and northern Michigan and far northern Wisconsin.\n\nOfficials will likely issue new alerts and update or rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming days.\n\nThe inclement weather will likely cause widespread transport disruptions across the affected areas. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Dangerous and challenging driving conditions are also likely on secondary and rural roads as maintenance crews prioritize clearing major routes. Authorities will likely close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too hazardous. Gusty winds will threaten to topple high-profile vehicles throughout the affected areas. The disruptive weather will likely cause delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Snowfall and strong winds could bring down power lines and trees with foliage."
