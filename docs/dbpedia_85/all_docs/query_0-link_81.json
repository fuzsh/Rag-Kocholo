        "text": "I-35 reopens\n\nInterstate 35 reopened to northbound and southbound travelers Saturday morning following a 90-mile closure that began Friday afternoon, according to Iowa DOT Winter Operations Administrator Craig Bargfrede.\n\nNorthbound lanes slowly reopened around 8 a.m. Saturday morning, with southbound lanes beginning to reopen around 11 a.m.\n\nThe interstate had previously closed from U.S. 30 near Ames to U.S. 18 outside Clear Lake ― a nearly 90-mile stretch ― because of hazardous driving conditions, the Iowa Department of Transportation announced Friday afternoon.\n\nBlizzard warning to end at 6 a.m. Saturday\n\nWhat happens next with the holiday week blizzard of 2022? Though conditions will remain rough for several days, it appears to be winding down.\n\nAlexis Jimenez, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Johnston, said the blizzard warning that remains in effect for the northern half of the state will expire at 6 a.m. Saturday. And the wind chill warning for southern and central Iowa, including the Des Moines metro ― where it replaced a blizzard warning early Friday ― is slated to expire at noon Saturday.\n\nIt’s unclear what kind of warning or watch might replace the blizzard and wind chill warnings, Jimenez said, adding that additional evaluation is needed.\n\nMeanwhile, the wind was still blowing hard. One gust reached just over 57 mph in Mason City on Friday afternoon. Strong winds, close to 30 mph, will continue in Iowa Saturday, “but nothing like we’ve seen today,” Jimenez said.\n\nLooking farther ahead, the weather service says snow will fall Christmas night, with about an inch of accumulation, as the high reaches into the double digits. More snow is expected Monday morning, then a return to more moderate temperatures, with a high of 28 on Tuesday.\n\nI-35 shutdown reported by Iowa DOT\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation is shutting down Interstate 35 in both directions as blowing snow makes travel extremely hazardous.\n\nThe department's Iowa 511 road conditions site shows the highway closing from U.S. 30 near Ames to U.S. 18 outside Clear Lake.\n\nThe closure comes as a blizzard warning remains in effect for the area, despite being lifted early Friday for some Des Moines metro counties, including Polk and Dallas.\n\nTruck stops say they've seen few stranded motorists\n\nSome big Iowa truck stops ― havens for storm-weary motorists ― say they haven’t had to host stranded travelers during this week’s blizzard.\n\nHeather DeBaillie, spokesperson for Iowa 80 Truck Stop off Interstate 80 in eastern Iowa, said drivers are satopping as usual at the sprawling service center, which bills itself as the world's largest. But so far, all have been able to continue their travels, despite the weather and road conditions.\n\n“I think we’ve been lucky,” DeBaillie said.\n\nThe same is true on Interstate 35. Amber Jones, assistant store leader at the Kwik Star truck stop in Story City, said she’s seen a steady stream of customers looking for milk, eggs, butter and other staples. But she said traffic in the store has slowed since the storm began Thursday.\n\nThe station will stay open through the holidays, said Jones, who had to drive through a few drifts to make it to work.\n\n“I’ve seen worse,” she said.\n\nDeep freeze leaves downtown Des Moines landmark dry\n\nAfter taking a toll on Iowa's roads and airline schedules, the sub-zero cold also is making trouble for a major downtown Des Moines office complex. Building management on Friday advised tenants of Capital Square, including the Des Moines Register, that water mains on two sides of the building had burst because of the cold. It said it was working on repairs with the city and contractors.\n\nThe building on the west side of Cowles Commons is known for its dramatic atrium, which has hosted many festivals and other events. At 486,755 square feet, Capital Square is the third-largest multi-tenant office building in the central business district, behind 801 Grand and the Ruan Center.\n\nAs officer hit, Clive joins chorus to stay home\n\nThe Clive Police Department has joined the growing number of law enforcement agencies calling for drivers to stay off the roads after one of its patrol vehicles was crumpled while on what the department described in a Facebook posting as the Interstate 35/80 “ice rink.” The driver of the car that collided with police vehicle was going too fast for the slippery conditions, the post said.\n\n“Our best advice is to stay home, enjoy the day and have a nice hot cup of coffee while binge-watching your favorite streaming service,” the post said.\n\nThe officer was not injured, but the department said the vehicle is probably a total loss.\n\nReynolds eases restrictions to speed heating fuel deliveries\n\nIn a measure that's been fairly routine during periods of extended low temperatures, Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a proclamation to ease restrictions on transport of and access to heating fuel. Effective through Jan. 1, the proclamation suspends the regulatory provisions of Iowa Code pertaining to hours of service for crews and drivers delivering propane, diesel, natural gas, and other fuels used for residential, agricultural, and commercial heating for the duration of the blizzard.\n\nDes Moines airport chief sees flight disruptions dying down\n\nKevin Foley, executive director of Des Moines International Airport, said that when he woke up Friday morning, he saw that 10 departing flights and eight arrivals had been canceled. But since then, there have been no additional cancellations, he said.\n\n\"We do have cancellations. People should check the website, the airline website if they want to know if their flight is delayed or canceled,\" Foley said. \"The weather is obviously causing some havoc as far as the airline operations are concerned.\"\n\nFoley also acknowledged that plows are still clearing the runways of wind-driven drifts. \"But both runways are open and the airport is ... fully operational,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, he is cautiously optimistic that the disruptions will abate before the holiday travel period ends.\n\n\"The weather is supposed to improve,\" he said. \"I believe we're supposed to get up to maybe 14 (degrees) tomorrow and the wind is supposed to die down. And so as this moves to the east and moves on out of the United States, we would hope travel would improve.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he said he has a reminder for airport users.\n\n\"We do have heated bus shelters,\" he said. \"If you're in one of the remote lots, we don't want people standing outside.\"\n\nIowa State Patrol: Despite improving weather, Iowa roads still hazardous\n\nWhile the decision by the National Weather Service to downgrade its blizzard warning in parts of Iowa is welcome news, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Friday that driving conditions across the state remain treacherous.\n\n\"The entire NW third of Iowa is still 'travel not advised' with some roads labeled 'impassable.' We continue to see tow bans across our state,\" Dinkla said. \"The Iowa State Patrol is still urging drivers to stay off the roads as much as possible. Tomorrow, weather conditions will begin to improve and roads will be safer to travel on.\"\n\nNew figures Dinkla provided show the scope of the winter storm's disruption of holiday travel. From noon Wednesday to 5 a.m. Friday, troopers had received 788 calls for service and investigated 235 crashes, including 21 with injuries. There had been no deaths. Troopers also assisted 553 motorists.\n\nDes Moines police spokesperson Sgt. Paul Parizek warns drivers to continue to exercise care, despite the improving conditions.\n\n\"We’re all happy to see any improvement in the weather, but the winds and extremely low temperatures can still create hazardous driving conditions,\" Parizek said. \"Driving too fast for the conditions was a significant contributing factor in most of the 92 crashes that DMPD responded to yesterday. Slow down, and give each other some extra space.\"\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation also advised against driving.\n\n\"We would still caution motorists to delay their travel if they can,\" said Andrea Henry, a spokesperson for the agency. \"There are still a lot of roads especially just north of the metro that are 'travel not advised,' and many of them that are completely covered as well. ... \"If travelers do want to travel, we ask them to make sure they slow down and drive the conditions and wear their seat belts and remove distractions, of course.\"\n\nNational Weather Service calls off blizzard warning for some Iowa counties\n\nIn a hopeful sign, the National Weather Service early Friday lowered the blizzard warning for some Iowa counties, including most of the Des Moines metro, though a wind chill warning and winter weather advisory still apply. In some other parts of Iowa, it reduced the blizzard warning to a winter storm warning. Much of the northern half of the state, however, remains under a blizzard warning.\n\nThe change represented a reversal from the previous forecast, when the weather service said conditions would likely worsen through Friday. In its forecast discussion, it said the change was made because of improvements in visibility. Blowing snow continues to cut visibility to a mile or less in the blizzard warning area, but in southwest counties, the weather service said, \"visibility has remained steady at 8 miles or better.\"\n\n\"To account for this improvement the southwest counties in the winter storm warming and blizzard warning have been converted to a winter weather advisory and wind chill warning,\" the weather service said.\n\nIt also said that \"towards Saturday morning\" the center of the storm \"should push far enough east that winds will diminish towards 30 mph across the area. This should reduce visibility concerns (from) blowing snow, which at this point should also start to compact and become less blowable in general. When this happens the winter storm warning and blizzard warning will expire, to be replaced by the wind chill warning.\"\n\nOnce wind chills rise above minus 30 degrees ― they were at minus 39 degrees early Friday in Des Moines, with 32 mph winds and 44 mph gusts ― when the wind chill warnings may begin to fold, the weather service said.\n\nIt cautioned that even then, however, temperatures will still be dangerously low, \"especially for anyone that becomes stranded in blizzard conditions.\"\n\nLooking farther ahead, the weather service calls for some light snow on Christmas night, amounting to less than an inch. It said they by Tuesday, temperatures will begin to climb back toward normal for the season.\n\nTroopers, police frantically busy as storm makes a mess of Iowa roads\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol's workload grew apace with the blizzard through the day Thursday as the storm caused dozens of accidents. According to figures provided by the state patrol, troopers from noon to 5 p.m. had investigated 137 accidents and assisted 261 motorists. Both figures were more than double those for the preceding 24 hours ― already a busy period.\n\nBecause of the extreme cold, the salt and other products the Iowa Department of Transportation and Iowa cities were using to help keep roads clear were largely ineffectual. S\n\n“One hundred percent all across Iowa we are seeing 100% snow- or ice-covered roads,” State patrol spokesperson Alex Dinkla said Thursday, adding that high winds blowing snow are limiting visibility and making the roads even more slick.\n\n“The tricky part about the road conditions that we are going to see today going through tomorrow is the blowing snow in different areas is going to create a glaze of ice over most of the roadways,” he said.\n\n“The overall message is if you do not need to travel, stay at home,\" he said. \"We don't want anyone to put themselves or others at risk.”\n\nDinkla also said the state of Iowa has issued a temporary ban on towing vehicles, which means any cars left stuck out on the roads or in ditches may not be cleared until Monday, when conditions are safer.\n\nDes Moines police also saw a huge rise in traffic-related problems. According to a police news release, they investigated a total of 38 crashes in the 14 hours from 4 p.m. Wednesday, when snowfall became a serious factor, to 6 a.m Thursday, when it began to taper off. In the subsequent eight hours ending at 2 p.m. Thursday, as wind-chilled temperatures plunged and roads turned icy, they investigated 48 crashes.\n\nIn addition, two Des Moines police cruisers were involved in crashes Thursday while being used for wreck investigations on Interstate 235, the release said. There were no injuries.\n\nSmall-town life goes on in western Iowa, despite blizzard\n\nFar from the storm's disruptions to airports, highways and city bustle, life went on pretty much as usual in the rural western Iowa town of Soldier, despite the cold and snow.\n\nLeonard Jensen had brought his 1978 International 1086 tractor into the hamlet of fewer than 150 people earlier in the week. He’ll use it to move snow from the Soldier Lutheran Church parking lot, and if others armed with snowblowers and plows haven’t beat him to it, he’ll clear driveways and alleys across the town.\n\nIt’s typical for residents to move from house to house, clearing driveways and sidewalks after a big storm, said Paul Coen.\n\n“They really take care of each other. And they take care of their pastor,” said Coen, a retired pastor who travels from Millard, a neighborhood in the Omaha, Nebraska, metro, to minister to the Soldier Lutheran Church and Faith Lutheran Church in Onawa.\n\nLike other rural towns, Soldier has lost a lot over the years as the population has aged and dwindled, including grocery stores and schools. But residents' willingness to watch over each other is still alive, says Patty Jensen, president of Soldier Lutheran Church’s council and Leonard Jensen’s wife.\n\n“We’re a little town, so we come together whenever there’s a need. Not just when there’s a winter storm,” she said.\n\nThat means putting together church potlucks, hosting Santa Claus, bagging 40 boxes of Christmas cookies and candies for area nursing home residents and others who are isolated, and making sure those who need a trip to the doctor have rides.\n\n“It’s just the way of our town,” Patty Jensen said.\n\nBlizzard expected to strengthen overnight\n\nAs Iowans shivered in the cold of a holiday-week blizzard, the onslaught from the monster storm was far from over.\n\nThough the National Weather Service said the wide-ranging system's leading edge was over Lake Michigan, the frigid air and heavy wind besetting Iowa was set to strengthen Thursday night and Friday, bringing blowing snow and dangerous wind chill across the state.\n\nThe weather service, in an advisory discussion posting, forecast an \"explosive deepening\" of the storm's low-pressure system Friday night.\n\n\"For Iowa, this means winds will be stronger tonight and Friday (than) they have been so far,\" the advisory said.\n\nIt said blowing snow already was cutting visibility to as little as a quarter mile in parts of the state.\n\n\"With these stronger winds continuing to loft snow, we continue to forecast blizzard conditions tonight into Friday ... . Those blizzard conditions will be most likely in rural, open areas so if you are in a sheltered, city/urban location and it doesn't look bad, do not be deceived.\"\n\nThe advisory said the strengthening wind will result in wind chills \"of -35F or lower across all of Iowa.\"\n\nWeakening of the system isn't expected until midday Saturday.\n\nEx-Iowa Dem Chair Troy Price says he's lucky to be home\n\nUntil Saturday afternoon, when the winds begin to abate, air travel is likely to be a hit-or-miss proposition. At Des Moines International Airport, delays mounted as every outgoing flight underwent a de-icing process. Several flights to Denver and the perpetually storm-plagued O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, both major connection points for flights from Iowa, were canceled as the day went on.\n\nFormer Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price, now working in New Hampshire, changed his flight home to Des Moines from Thursday to Wednesday so he would be assured of being able to spend the holiday with his husband.\n\nPrice felt lucky to have done so, even as he tweeted a photo of himself in a frozen ski mask as he shoveled Iowa snow.\n\n“I’m glad I did that,\" he said. \"Otherwise, I don’t think I would have made it home for the holidays.”\n\nNorwalk mom: We'll hunker down\n\nFor Iowa parents with children home on the long holiday school break, the threatening conditions outdoors make for a lot of family togetherness.\n\nJacy Rooney of Norwalk, making a shopping run to a southwest Des Moines Hy-Vee, said sending her kids out to play in the snow wasn't an option.\n\n\"It's just too cold,\" Rooney said, adding, \"We're going to hunker down, I think, for the weekend.\"\n\nAmes resident dons military Arctic gear to remove snow\n\nAmes resident Barry Romitti was out in his Air Force Arctic gear he used to wear when stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska, to blow snow Thursday morning as the National Weather Service was reporting a wind chill of minus 35 degrees.\n\n\"It's every bit as cold right now as it was when I was stationed up there in the absolute peak of the winter,\" Romitti said.\n\nRomitti said he and his neighbors often take turns blowing the snow in the neighborhood and this time he drew the short straw.\n\n\"Yes, I'll go do my neighbors’ if I have time, but today might be hard because of the wind chill. I don't think I could stay out that long,\" Romitti said.\n\nDes Moines main library partially reopens as warming center\n\nAfter closing Thursday because of the blizzard, the Des Moines Central Library downtown has repoened its meeting room wing until 5 p.m. as a warming center. All of the other branches remain closed, but will be open and serving as warming centers on Friday, library officials say.\n\nNortheast Iowa farmer works to keep cattle alive, healthy in life-threatening cold\n\nFarming is hard, hazardous work ― perhaps never harder or more hazardous than when temperatures fall to livestock-threatening lows.\n\nAt 5:30 a.m. Thursday, Dave Reuber started shoveling snow out feed troughs for roughly 1,000 cattle at his feedlot in eastern Iowa, about a mile west of Strawberry Point, roughly midway between Waterloo and Dubuque.\n\nWithout the work, moisture would freeze the feed, making it impossible for the cattle to eat, said Reuber, working with three other men. Clearing out the troughs was like “shoveling a mile-long driveway,” said Reuber, layered up from head to toe to keep warm.\n\nAnd that was just the first chore the men needed to tackle before they could begin feeding the cattle. Among the others: Clearing snow from the pens so animals, weighing up to 1,300 pounds, could stay dry and warm, and moving snow from the feedlot roads so they could get to giant bunkers filled with feed.\n\nThe men tackled some of the most important work on Wednesday, before the storm hit, said Reuber, who owns the Eastern Iowa Cattle feedlot with a business partner: They moved bedding ― mostly corn stalks ― into all the cattle’s pens and built windbreaks so some of the animal that are mostly outside have protection. Then they checked all the waterers, using heaters or trickling the water to ensure they didn't freeze up.\n\n“Making sure they have water is a really big deal,” said Reuber, who also provides nutritional services to other producers.\n\nReuber’s crew will go through the routine again Thursday afternoon.\n\nFeeding the cattle twice a day also helps keep the animals warm, Reuber said. “The cattle generate heat, digesting feed. That helps keep their body temperature up.”\n\nThe wind chill at midday was about 30 degrees below zero. But recent snow and cold have helped acclimate the cattle to the pre-holiday storm.\n\n“Us too,” Reuber said.\n\nTruck wreck blocks I-80 lanes\n\nInterstate 80 eastbound is blocked just west of Jordan Creek Parkway because of a semitrailer crash with injuries, the Iowa State Patrol reports. It adds in a tweet: \"Travel is NOT advised on I-80 in between Des Moines and Iowa City!\" Sgt. Alex Dinkla, the state patrol spokesperson, says troopers \"are on back to back calls in several areas.\"\n\nAssigned to the weather beat, sports reporter rebels\n\nPressed into duty to cover the blizzard, sports reporter Mark Woodley of Waterloo's KWWL made no secret of how he felt about the assignment: \"Tune in for the next couple hours to watch me get progressively crankier and crankier.\" And that's probably not even the best line in the collection of outtakes Woodley tweeted.\n\nFlight cancellations, delays continue, but so do airport operations\n\nAcross the nation, flight delays were mounting as the winter storm moved eastward. The Associated Press reported that more than 1,700 flights had been canceled Thursday morning. It said the Chicago O'Hare and Denver airports ― major transfer points for Iowa passengers ― were experiencing the worst disruptions. At Des Moines International Airport, there were several cancellations, particularly for the budget Southwest, Allegiant and Frontier airlines. But plenty of other flights remained scheduled as of midday.\n\nIowa lieutenant governor: It's cold out there\n\nIowa Lt. Gov. Adam Gregg is providing graphic evidence via Twitter of just how cold it is in Iowa on Thursday. Des Moines at 11:15 a.m. was recording a temperature of minus 10 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Storm Lake was minus 15. Perhaps the warmest place, so to speak, in the state: Clinton, with a reading of zero. And that's before wind chill.\n\nIowa State Patrol's message: Don't drive in blizzard\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol is warning in no uncertain terms that driving on Iowa roadways amid Thursday's blizzard conditions is a bad idea.\n\n\"We really want to get the message out to motorists that, although the DOT is clearing the roadways as quickly as possible, there are still areas that look CLEAR, but are a sheet of ice,\" Sgt. Alex Dinkla, the state patrol spokesperson, said in a text. \"We continue to see crashes and vehicles sliding off the roadways.\"\n\nAmong other bulletins from the Iowa Department of Transportation's road conditions website: Iowa 141 \"is completely covered in ice\" and Interstate 80's eastbound lanes are blocked by accidents in two spots. In addition, a westbound lane is blocked by a crash near Coralville.\n\nAllegiant joins other airlines in waiving rebooking fees for weather-canceled flights\n\nAllegiant Air is joining other airlines serving Des Moines International Airport in waiving rebooking fees for flights canceled due to weather. Sonya Padgett, an Allegiant spokesperson, also said customers whose flights are canceled may opt for a full refund.\n\nTo see what airlines are offering, go here.\n\nIowa DOT: I-80 eastbound blocked by crashes\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation is cautioning against travel on Interstate 80, with crashes blocking the eastbound lanes near Grinnell and Williamsburg and one at the exit ramp to Jordan Creek Parkway in the Des Moines metro. It also is reporting multiple crashes blocking portions of Interstate 380 between North Liberty and Shueyville.\n\nDes Moines library clarifies: All branches close because of blizzard\n\nThe Des Moines Public Library clarified Thursday that all of its locations will be closed Thursday because of the blizzard. They are the Central, Forest Avenue, Franklin Avenue and east, north and south side libraries. The libraries serve as warming centers, and library officials pointed to this list of other sites for people seeking shelter.\n\nSome power outages reported as winds rise\n\nMidAmerican Energy, one of Iowa's major power providers, is reporting a smattering of outages across the state due to the blizzard's high winds, including about 200 homes in Warren County and 26 in Marion County.\n\nA handful of outages are being reported in the Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Storm Lake and Quad Cities area, the company said.\n\nAlliant Energy is reporting eight customers across the state are without power due to the storm.\n\nFor outage information, go to MidAmerican Energy's Outage Watch site or Alliant’s outage center.\n\nNumerous Unity Point clinics closed\n\nNumerous Unity Point clinics are closed across central Iowa on Thursday because of the weather, and some also will be closed Friday, according to a notice on Unity Point's website. The health care system also advised that it is having phone problems.\n\n\"Calls are coming into our system, but are being misdirected. This is creating a situation where patients and families cannot reach their care teams. We are currently working on this issue and expect a resolution very soon. If you are having trouble, please call 515-241-5621 or message anne.pederson@unitypoint.org. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\"\n\nDes Moines police report I-235 crashes\n\nDes Moines police reported on Twitter that they were dealing with multiple crashes at Interstate 235 and Guthrie Avenue, including a jack-knifed semi trailer. Motorists should expect delays, the police said.\n\nDes Moines Register newspaper delivery may be delayed\n\nOvernight snowfall and hazardous travel conditions may delay the delivery of the Des Moines Register in many parts of the state on Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022. Our delivery partners are working to ensure delivery as soon as it's safely possible.\n\nThe Register is offering free access to the e-Edition, a digital version of the daily newspaper, to all readers through Sunday. The e-Edition is available at DesMoinesRegister.com/eedition and is normally available only to subscribers.\n\nA Des Moines Register Print Edition app is also available for Apple and Android devices.\n\nBlizzard conditions are expected throughout the state Thursday into Friday. Delivery delays may continue, with delivery not resuming until Sunday in some parts of the state. While we will strive to deliver the paper each day, the safety of our carriers and transportation partners is our highest priority.\n\nSubscribers needing assistance can contact customer support at help.desmoinesregister.com or 1-877-424-0225.\n\nCancellations, delays mount at DSM airport\n\nHoliday travel in the blizzard was off to a shaky start Thursday.\n\nAllegiant Air has canceled most of its arrivals and departures at Des Moines International Airport and other airlines are canceling or delaying flights, the airport's website shows.\n\nSouthwest Airlines canceled its flight leaving at 6 a.m. to St. Louis and its 6:50 a.m. flight to Denver. United Airlines canceled some of its flights to Chicago and Denver. Delta and American airlines have delayed some departures.\n\nAirlines generally were offering no-fee flight changes, though Allegiant on its website advises only that passengers should call its customer service line, which had long hold times Thursday morning.\n\nAirport officials urge travelers to check their site, www.flydsm.com, or use the apps for the airlines they’re flying for changes to their flight. The apps also one of the best ways to reschedule a flight, officials says.\n\nThe Des Moines airport estimated as many as 65,000 people will use the airport over the holidays to travel.\n\nIowa State Patrol responding to crashes across the state\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol says troopers have responded to more than 70 motor vehicle accidents on Iowa’s road since midday Wednesday and helped 141 motorists in distress that period.\n\nAt 8 a.m. Thursday, Iowa Department of Transportation reported there had been multiple additional single and multi-vehicle crashes on interstates and state highways since the state patrol released totals at 5 a.m.\n\nNational Weather Service: Stay inside!\n\nAs winds picked up Thursday morning and temperatures across Iowa plunged into negative territory, the National Weather Service in repeated the warning it has forecast over the past several days: \"Blizzard conditions combined with dangerous wind chills will create life threatening conditions for anyone that ventures out during the worst of this storm.\"\n\nThe temperature in Des Moines as of 7:30 a.m. was minus 6 degrees, with a 22 mph wind gusting to 31 mph, sending the wind chill to minus 30 degrees. The state was blanketed with 2 to 4 inches of snow, with isolated pockets of up to 5 inches. Forecasters expect the wind to easily loft the dry, loose flakes, creating whiteout conditions at times.\n\nSnow has largely ended, but winds are forecast to increase, then remain steady and strong through most of Saturday.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation echoed the weather service's warning, saying travel is not recommended. On Facebook, it showed a snowplow crew preparing for the day in Coralville, and asked those who do choose to drive to be careful and help keep its workers safe: \"If you can stay put today, please do that. If you must travel, please drive with caution, especially around snowplows. We want all of our snowfighters to get home to their families at the end of the shift.\"\n\nToo cold for Salvation Army bellringers, Rudolph\n\nOne of the most admirable things about Salvation Army bellringers is the endurance they display, standing in the cold to raise money for their cause. But even for them, there are limits. The Salvation Army of Des Moines announced that the bellringers won't be at their usual red kettles on Thursday as the blizzard's winds drive \"feels-like\" temperatures as low as 40 degrees below zero. The charity also is closing its food pantries for the day, but notes that faithful givers can still support its work with gifts made at desmoinesredkettle.org.\n\nPreviously:Second rare gold coin valued around $2k found in Salvation Army kettle in Des Moines\n\nLikewise, Rudolph will be taking a break from guiding Santa's sleigh until it warms up ― at least a little. Des Moines Performing Arts says both the 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Thursday performances of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Musical\" have been postponed. Ticketholders will be notified when performances are rescheduled in 2023, it said, and previously purchased tickets will be accepted.\n\nSouthern Iowa conditions monitored in case blizzard warning needs to be expanded\n\nSouthern Iowa wasn't included in the blizzard warning, but the National Weather Service says that could change as the storm rolls in.\n\n\"To the south, land use and topography along with no existing snowpack raises questions about whether blizzard conditions would materialize. However, we will monitor in case confidence increases to expand the warning,\" the weather service says in its latest forecast discussion.\n\nThe guidance also says snow totals across the region should be 3 to 6 inches, with the snow ending by midday Thursday as blizzard-level winds kick up.\n\nElsewhere, the blizzard's footprint was changing. Western Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, northeast Kansas and western Nebraska were removed from the blizzard warning. But the western and northern lower peninsula of Michigan, the eastern upper peninsula and parts of North and South Dakota and eastern Montana were added, as well as a sliver of northeastern Wyoming. Weather service guidance for Wisconsin said the blizzard warning was dropped there because of a decreased snowfall total.\n\nDes Moines Public Library, usually a warming center, to close for storm\n\nThe Des Moines Public Library announced on social media late Wednesday that it would be closed Thursday because of the blizzard. The library system is among designated warming centers in the city, and the posting directed people needing somewhere to go as temperatures plunge to check for alternate sites. A list of warming centers is available here.\n\nThe posting did not specify whether only the central library downtown would be closed, or the branch libraries, as well. They are the Forest Avenue, Franklin Avenue and east, north and south side libraries.\n\nIowans stocking up on dairy products as blizzard looms\n\nIowans are buying the bad-weather standards: “Milk, bread and eggs,” Miriam Anderson Brown, CEO of Des Moines dairy Anderson Erickson, said Wednesday, adding that the company is pushing to meet demand for its products as the blizzard approaches.\n\nCustomers also are buying whipping cream, sour cream and other cooking essentials, Anderson Brown said.\n\n“Based on what we see, people are going to stay in and bake” while the blizzard rages, she said.\n\nAnd drink eggnog ― “they’re buying a lot of eggnog,” she said.\n\nLike dairy producers across the state, the company plans to continue working as long as possible into the storm, picking up milk and processing and delivering products. The business will stop only if the weather forces it to.\n\nWhether it's inclement weather or the holiday, “We have to keep that product moving from cow to consumer, no matter what,” Anderson Brown said. “That’s what you sign up for.”\n\nSchool, business and other storm- and holiday-related closures will allow the dairy to cut some deliveries and shift products, especially to grocery stores, she said.\n\n“We have to be patient and see what Mother Nature gives us,” she said.\n\nSnow starts falling in earnest\n\nSnow was falling across the Des Moines metro shortly after 4 p.m., and streets were quickly becoming slick. The National Weather Service said the snow would continue through Thursday morning but that the accumulation would be moderate, at less than 6 inches, though some parts of eastern Iowa could receive more. But it repeatedly warned that the light, dry, flakey snow would be easily lofted by the blizzard's winds, arriving Thursday afternoon, and pose an extreme danger of whiteouts on the state's roadways.\n\nLibraries close ahead of blizzard's arrival\n\nSeveral Des Moines metro area libraries announced Wednesday afternoon that they will close earlier than usual this week due to the blizzard. Among them:\n\nThe Altoona library will be closed Thursday.

They have also instituted their weather amnesty plan which removes restrictions for entry. Our partners are also actively encouraging individuals to seek shelter within their facilities.\"\n\nHe urged all Des Moines residents to \"check on those in our community and neighborhoods who might need some additional attention and care.\"\n\nVon Maur swarmed by shoppers seeking to beat the blizzard\n\nIowans are making a mad dash to get their Christmas shopping done, said Melody Wright, chief operating officer at Von Maur, the Davenport-based department store chain that last month moved its longtime Des Moines store at Valley West Mall to Jordan Creek Town Center.\n\nShoppers flooded the store Tuesday and were there in force again Wednesday, Wright said.\n\n“People definitely got the message that the weather is coming,” Wright said. “They know Thursday and Friday could be questionable.\"\n\nThe traffic is equal to “what you would expect to see on a Friday or Saturday … not a Tuesday,” she said, adding that the company sent corporate staff members to the new store to help keep up with demand.\n\nShoppers are making major purchases, not just small gifts to round out their lists, she said.\n\n“It’s big, big items. It’s that handbag that the wife has wanted for a long time that can run several hundred dollars to $1,500,” she said.\n\nThe department store chain is closely monitoring the weather to determine whether it should remain open Thursday and Friday, Wright said. “Our biggest concern is that it’s safe for employees to come in,” she said.\n\nWright said she expects some customers will want to squeeze in a few purchases on Christmas Eve, even though last-minute shopping “is not quite as crazy as it used to be.”\n\nEastern metro cities issue parking restrictions for storm\n\nThe eastern suburbs of Des Moines have all declared parking restrictions ahead of the blizzard:\n\nAltoona's snow ordinance, banning parking on city streets, will be in place indefinitely, according to the Altoona Police Department.\n\nAnkeny's snow ordinance is in place until noon Saturday. Until then, street parking is not allowed and is prohibited in The District at Prairie Trail and Uptown from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.\n\nBondurant's snow ordinance is scheduled to last until 11 a.m. Saturday.

It said the parking ban will continue until 5 p.m. Thursday to allow plows to clear snow, and violators may be ticketed.\n\nThe city also reminded property owners that sidewalks must be cleared within 48 hours after a snowfall.\n\nRoad across Saylorville Lake dam closing for storm\n\nThe road that crosses Saylorville Lake dam is set to close at 3 p.m. Wednesday because of the impending blizzard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced.\n\nThe Corps said in a news release that the road will be closed from Northwest 78th Avenue near the Iowa National Guard Armory to the Saylorville Lake Visitor Center entrance. In addition, it said all Saylorville Lake recreation areas have been closed.\n\nThe road will reopen when conditions improve and snow can be cleared.\n\nDes Moines shelter seeing increased need as blizzard nears\n\nThe artic blast has boosted already strong demand for warm beds and shelter at Bethel Mission, a men’s shelter run by Hope Ministries in Des Moines, said Kathy Coady, Hope Ministries spokeswoman.\n\nBethel Mission has beds for 110 men, with “overflow sleeping mats” for about 20 more men needing shelter, Coady said, adding that the facility also serves as a warming center.\n\n“Extreme weather does change the number of people coming to us,” she said. “But it’s not as dramatic a difference as people might think, because the need is great year-round.”\n\nThe mission, which also provides meals, has seen a 24% increase in the number of people needing food and a 10% rise in overnight stays so far this year, Coady said.\n\nWith spiking inflation, “it’s just harder for people to make ends meet,” Coady said, adding that Hope Ministries also operates a shelter for women and children, but it’s not a walk-in operation.\n\nHope Ministries has strong community support, Coady said, but additional financial assistance is needed. “We have a huge need,” she said.\n\nISU to be partially closed during storm\n\nIowa State University will partially close on Thursday, the university announced.\n\nAdministration asked supervisors to give as much flexibility as possible for employees to work remotely or take leave that day, as a blizzard moves through Iowa. Supervisors of emergency and critical infrastructure employees were asked to confirm team members can safely report to campus.\n\nWinter classes will meet virtually as scheduled, and Friday is a university holiday.\n\nSnow moves in faster than expected\n\nAndrew Ansorge, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Johnston, said precipitation in Iowa is occurring a little sooner than forecast.\n\nSome parts of western Iowa are seeing drizzle that’s freezing once it hits the ground. “We’ve had a few reports of icy roads, power lines and bridges,” Ansorge said.\n\nThe freezing drizzle Wednesday will transition to snow, most of which will hit Iowa Wednesday afternoon and night and is expected to end by midday Thursday in central Iowa.\n\nThe front coming into Iowa Wednesday night will bring strong winds, gusting 40 to 50 mph Thursday, creating blizzard conditions from noon Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\nWind chill temperatures will hit minus 30 to 35 degrees across the state, with temperatures dropping to 45 below in northwest Iowa.\n\n“It’s not going to be pretty,” Ansorge said, adding that travel is strongly discouraged Thursday and Friday.\n\nDMACC shuts down because of weather\n\nDes Moines Area Community College says it is closing all of its campuses at 6 p.m. Wednesday and will keep them closed Thursday because of the forecast blizzard. The affected locations are in Ames, Ankeny, Boone, Carroll, Newton, Perry, Des Moines, Templeton and West Des Moines.\n\nBlizzard warning issued for most Iowa counties\n\nThe National Weather Service at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday upgraded its winter storm warning for most of Iowa to a blizzard warning, extending from noon Thursday to 6 a.m. Saturday. A winter storm warning remains in effect until then.\n\n\"A powerful winter storm will begin impacting the region today and last into Friday night,\" the weather service said in its warning. \"A significant multifaceted event is expected, including periods of concurrent blizzard conditions and extreme cold. Travel could be dangerous to near impossible at times Thursday and Friday. Extreme cold is expected as well with wind chills falling to 20 to 40 below zero from late Thursday through the end of the week.\"\n\nOutpacing forecasts, light but steady snow was falling in downtown Des Moines about 11:30 a.m., and heavier snow was hitting northwest Iowa. Forecasts had not called for snow to begin until about 1 p.m. in Des Moines, with the heaviest snow after 4 p.m.\n\nWinter storm warning widens in Midwest\n\nThe winter storm warning issued Tuesday afternoon for most of Iowa, southeast Nebraska and south central and parts of western Minnesota broadened Wednesday. It now covers most of eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin, northeast Kansas all but the southernmost parts of Illinois and Missouri.\n\nAltogether, almost two-thirds of the U.S. population is under some sort of winter weather warning, watch or advisory.\n\n“The National Weather Service has a large area across the country which has wind chill warnings or wind chill watches,\" said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, told the Associated Press. \"The system is so large and so encompassing in the U.S., there’s actually about 190 million people currently under some type of winter weather advisory.”\n\nUrbandale: Get all cars off the street\n\nUrbandale police announced via Twitter that all vehicles parked on the city's streets must be moved by 6 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"The ordinance remains in effect until the streets are completely plowed from curb to curb AND it has stopped snowing,\" the announcement said, adding that vehicles that aren't moved may be ticketed or towed.\n\nSafety message: Beware of hazards with generators, heaters, candles\n\nIf the winter storm knocks out Iowans’ electricity, residents should not use portable generators inside their homes, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday.\n\n“Portable generators create a risk of CO (carbon monoxide) poisoning that can kill in minutes. CO is called the invisible killer because it is colorless and odorless. Exposed persons may become unconscious before experiencing CO-poisoning symptoms of nausea, dizziness or weakness, and it can lead to death,” the agency said in a news release.\n\nAdditionally, residents should use care when using portable heaters, candles and other heat and light sources, the agency said.\n\nIn the case of a power outage, the commission says:\n\nOperate portable generators outside only, at least 20 feet away from occupied structures, and direct the generator’s exhaust away from homes and any other buildings people may enter. Also, close any windows and other openings in the path of the generator’s exhaust. Do not operate a generator on a porch or in a carport. They are too close to the home.\n\nCheck that portable generators have been maintained properly, and read and follow the labels, instructions and warnings on the generator and in the owner’s manual.\n\nWhen buying a portable generators, look for models that have a carbon monoxide shut-off safety feature, which is designed to shut the generator off automatically when high levels of the gas are present around the generator.\n\nWith portable heaters, people should:\n\nKeep all sides of the heater at least 3 feet from beds, clothes, curtains, papers, sofas and other items that can catch fire.\n\nAlways use a wall outlet, never a power strip, and never run the heater’s cord under rugs or carpeting.\n\nMake sure the heater is not near water. Never touch it if you are wet.\n\nPlace the heater on a stable, level surface where it will not be knocked over.\n\nNever leave a heater running unattended in a confined space.\n\nThe agency urges consumers to never use charcoal indoors, which also can create lethal carbon monoxide levels. That includes cooking on a charcoal grill in a garage, even with an open door.\n\nIt also warns consumers to use flashlights instead of candles during power outages. If using candles, do not place them on or near anything that can catch fire. Never leave burning candles unattended. Extinguish candles when leaving the room and before sleeping.\n\nCentral Iowa weather forecast: How much snow are we supposed to get?\n\nThe National Weather Service in its latest forecast calls for snowfall to begin early afternoon Wednesday, picking up after 4 p.m. and ending by about noon Thursday. The forecast total isn't severe ― about 4 inches. More concerning is the wind, which is expected to accelerate after midnight, blowing steadily at 20 mph to 25 mph through Friday before beginning to taper off Saturday.\n\nWith extremely low temperatures already forecast, that will bring severe wind chills (click here for an illustrated explanation of that \"feels like\" temperature, and how this event will compare to previous ones in central Iowa) and blowing snow, which can cause whiteouts ― a severe threat to travelers.\n\nThe weather service points out that in urban areas, with buildings and trees to baffle the wind, visibility can appear fine, but that in rural areas, the danger posed by blowing snow can be much more severe, and that people shouldn't make assumptions about whether it's safe to travel based solely on conditions in their neighborhoods.\n\nMore:How much snow is coming to Iowa? How bad will the wind chill be? Details on today's storm\n\nGovernor Kim Reynolds: Stay safe\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds' office released a statement on the impending winter storm early Wednesday:\n\n“In light of the impending winter storm, I’ve asked state agency directors to allow staff to work remotely on Thursday to the extent possible while they continue to deliver services to Iowans, and I encourage other businesses to do the same.\n\n\"My top priority is the safety of Iowans, and I ask that everyone stay informed about the forecast and road conditions and avoid any unnecessary travel. I also want to thank the first responders, law enforcement, snowplow drivers and others who are working around the clock to keep Iowans safe during this major winter storm.”\n\nWinter driving tips: How to keep safe while driving on slick Iowa roads\n\nFree rides to warming centers\n\nDART bus service is offering free rides to Polk County warming centers and shelters, the county has announced.

Instead of the typical 48 hours, the city will give residents 96 hours after the snow ends to clear their sidewalks, Public Works Director Jonathan Gano said in a news release.\n\n“We don’t want people to risk dangerous exposure in this storm if they don’t have to,” he said.\n\nResidents who don’t clear their sidewalks within the required timeframe are subject to a $75 fine.\n\nWhile the snow falls, Des Moines plans to keep its snowplows on snow routes “to keep our major roadways clear until the snow stops falling,” Gano said. Plows will move to residential streets once the storm ends, and all should be clear within 24 hours after that, he said.\n\nAirport: Check with airlines for flight delays, cancellations\n\nTravelers passing through Des Moines International Airport during the winter storm are likely to encounter delays as ground crews undertake de-icing operations for airliners.
