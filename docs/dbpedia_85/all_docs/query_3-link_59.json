        "text": "Winter Storm Gerri blasted the Midwest with heavy snow and blizzard conditions in mid-January and helped usher in brutally cold air across much of the Central U.S. The storm was also responsible for rare blizzard conditions in the Northwest and for flooding the coastal Norheast.\n\nGerri's history: Winter Storm Gerri arrived in the Northwest on Jan. 10 and quickly made itself known. G​erri prompted blizzard warnings for mountain areas of Oregon, Washington and Idaho for the first time since 2012. Stevens Pass, Washington, reported blizzard conditions and picked up 29 inches of snow in 30 hours through late on Jan. 9.\n\nG​erri thumped its way into the Sierra Nevada during the afternoon of Jan. 10 and almost immediately destabilized slopes at the ski resorts. A major avalanche occurred and buried multiple people at the Palisades Tahoe resort and a 66-year-old man was the first avalanche victim of the year. Three others were injured in the slide.\n\nA​ snow squall moved through Flagstaff, Arizona, on the morning of Jan. 11, which helped drop up to 3.7 inches in the city and 7 inches in northern Arizona.\n\n(​MORE: Winter Storm News on January 11th as it Happened)\n\nParts of Interstate 70 were closed in Kansas for a time on Jan. 11. The following morning, black ice caused dozens of wrecks in Kansas City as temperatures plummeted into the mid-teens.\n\nC​onditions really went downhill across the Midwest on Friday, January 12th, as Gerri strengthened as the storm moved from the Central Plains to the southern Great Lakes.\n\nMany locations in eastern and southern Iowa into southern and eastern Wisconsin picked up a foot or more of snow from Gerri. M​oline, Illinois, had its second snowiest day on record Friday, with 15.4 inches of snow, in records dating to 1882. Caucus events were canceled or moved online or to phone lines in Iowa due to the poor conditions.\n\n(​MORE: Winter Storm News on January 12th as it Happened)\n\nChicago picked up 6.7 inches of snow officially at O'Hare International Airport, but totals topped a foot in northern Illinois. M​uch lower snowfall totals came in from the shoreline in downtown Chicago and Milwaukee, due to winds flowing off record warm for mid-January, ice-free Lake Michigan water. Thundersnow was reported in Chicago, as witnessed by The Weather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore while on camera. More than 600 flights were canceled at the city's airports due to strong winds and blowing snow. Nearly 100,000 customers lost power across Chicagoland. Frostquakes shook parts of the city in the following days as temperatures dropped to around minus 10 degrees.\n\nA​ man taking care of his driveway in Franklin, a suburb of Milwaukee, died during the storm.\n\nGerri moved into southern Canada on Jan. 13, but the winter storm continued to produce snow and gusty winds in the Great Lakes, Midwest and northern New England. Winds gusted to between 40 and 60 mph from Michigan to western New York. Gusty conditions also lasted long past their welcome in the Plains and produced blizzard conditions in Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska through the afternoon.\n\n(​WATCH: Whiteout Conditions Continued on Jan. 13 in Iowa)\n\nPower outages due to gusty winds and heavy snow neared 375,000 customers from the Great Lakes to the mid-Atlantic that afternoon.\n\nS​trong southerly winds flooded portions of New England early in the day.\n\nP​ortland, Maine, saw historically high water levels during the morning hours due to stiff onshore winds. Coastal flooding was seen from coastal New Hampshire to southern Maine. Parts of southern Long Island also flooded.\n\nT​he amplification of the lake-effect snow machine behind Gerri combined with the frigid air behind the storm led Buffalo officials and the NFL to postpone the Pittsburgh Steelers at Buffalo Bills playoff game to the following day.\n\nThe Weather Company’s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.
