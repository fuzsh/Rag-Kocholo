        "text": "Utility companies across Michigan worked around the clock Saturday to restore power to thousands of customers following an extreme winter storm that swept across the state Friday.\n\nAs many as 186,000 utility customers were without power statewide Saturday morning. According to PowerOutage.us, over 48,000 customers remain powerless Sunday morning.\n\nAs of yesterday evening, 40,400 Consumers Energy customers were still without power. Roughly 463 Consumers Energy crews, alongside out-of-state contractors from Colorado, Oklahoma, Alabama and New York, have been battling high winds, slick road conditions and fallen tree limbs to restore power.\n\nThe hardest hit areas in Consumers Energy’s service area were in parts of mid-Michigan and the northeast Lower Peninsula, including Midland, Bay, Iosco, Ogemaw and Alcona counties. Swaths of the northeast received over a foot of snow and experienced blizzard conditions this weekend.\n\n“We’re making steady progress as we work safely to bring power back to the homes and businesses we serve as quickly as possible,” said Melissa Gleespen, one of Consumers Energy’s Officers in Charge of restoration. “Mother Nature continues to create a demanding work environment, but our crews are up to the challenge and committed to helping and protecting our customers.”\n\nConsumers is asking the public to be alert while crews operate on slippery roads and to stay at least 25 feet away from downed power lines and report unguarded lines by calling 911 and Consumers Energy at 800-477-5050\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, Presque Isle Electric & Gas Co-op, which serves 40,000 members across nine counties in northeast lower Michigan, has restored power to 3,835 members out of 4,315 who lost services in Alcona, Alpena, Cheboygan, Montmorency, Oscoda and Presque Isle Counties as a result of the winter storm.\n\n“Despite progress, the National Weather Service has issued further snowfall forecasts, posing additional challenges,” said Sommer Poquette, a marketing consultant for Presque Isle Electric & Gas Co-op. “Individual outages are expected to go into tomorrow, January 14.”\n\nMembers of Presque Isle Electric & Gas Co-op are asked to call 800-423-6634 if they’re experiencing power outages, unsafe conditions or witness any downed power lines.\n\nConsumers is a financial supporter of this station.\n\nOver 186,000 utility customers in Michigan woke up Saturday morning without power following a major winter storm that dumped heavy snow across the state and produced blizzard conditions in parts of the northeast Lower Peninsula Friday evening.\n\nConsumers Energy, the state’s largest energy provider, is reporting over 66,000 customers are without power. The utility company has pledged it will keep its promise of restoring power to customers within 24 hours.\n\n“We have over 450 crews of lineworkers and contractors working tirelessly to restore power,” said Melissa Gleespen, one of Consumers Energy’s Officers in Charge of restoration. “The high winds forecast for today will continue to present obstacles. But our crews are up to the challenge. We thank our customers and communities for their patience.”\n\nDTE Energy’s outage map indicates that over 115,000 customers are without power and estimates 70% of customers will be restored by the end of Saturday. Crews from across the country have been deployed by both companies to restore power as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nBoth Consumers and DTE are asking the public to give their crews space when repairing powerlines and said to call 911 to report any downed lines.\n\nThe area from Gladwin to Ogemaw County experienced some of the most intense snowfall. The National Weather Service said on a phone call with WCMU that 10 to 15 inches of snow fell overnight with localized blizzard conditions east of I-75.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, over 4,700 utility customers are without power in Alcona County, along with another roughly 5,000 in Ogemaw County.\n\n“I think the worst of this storm system is in the rearview mirror,” said Matt Gillen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gaylord. “We’re still going to see some snow showers linger across most of northern Michigan, and we’re going to transition to lake effect snow here today, and really for the foreseeable future.”\n\nFor the rest of Saturday, parts of mid-Michigan are under a winter storm warning, with wind gusts between 15-23 miles per hour. Total daytime snow accumulation is expected to be less than one inch.\n\nIn northern lower Michigan, the National Weather Service says the total daytime snow accumulation will be up to three inches with wind gusts as high as 30 miles per hour Saturday evening. Temperatures will hover in the mid-teens, with an overnight low around 13 degrees Fahrenheit up north.\n\nFor the eastern upper peninsula, a winter weather advisory is in effect through Saturday. High of 10 degrees Fahrenheit and wind chill values as low as -7 degrees Fahrenheit. Overnight low will be around 2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind gusts as high as 25 miles per hour. Total daytime snow accumulation will be around one inch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nConsumers Energy is a financial supporter of WCMU.\n\nMichigan residents are bracing for a winter storm expected to bring high winds, wet weather and subzero temperatures to parts of the state.\n\nThe storm's arrival Friday afternoon is already having an impact. Dozens of flights across Michigan have been delayed or cancelled, as officials prepare for heavy snow fall and up to 50 mph winds.\n\nThe National Weather Service projects the central and western parts of the state along the I-94 corridor may see more than a foot of snow.\n\n“We're going to see significant blowing and drifting snow,” said meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal on Friday. “It'd be having near zero visibility at times, near blizzard conditions and scattered to widespread power outages.”\n\nThe mid-Michigan region could see up to ten inches of snow over the next 24 hours and gusts around 44 mph.\n\n“Winds will peak Friday afternoon and into evening,” Jeruzal said. “There will be a possible lull in wind around midnight but they will build again Saturday after daybreak.”\n\nThe worst of the storm is expected to hit Bad Axe, Charlevoix, Alpena and Marquette. A blizzard warning has been issued for some of those areas.\n\n“Heaving amounts could be between 18-24 inches in northeastern Lower Peninsula and near Marquette in the Upper Peninsula,” Jeruzal said.\n\nRates of snowfall are anticipated to be around one to two inches of snow per hour, with most of the precipitation taking place Friday, 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. The snow could pick up again around 4 a.m. on Saturday.\n\nLake effect snow is expected through the weekend with sub-zero temperatures.\n\n“There’s potential for decent snow accumulations in the western parts of the state,” Jeruzal explained.\n\nMichigan utilities are preparing for possible power outages.\n\nConsumers Energy has staged hundreds of crews across the state as the winter storm rolls through, bringing more than 100 workers from across the country to assist.\n\n“We want to make sure people slow down and give space to our line crews, our forestry crews our field resources so that they have the ability to work safely as we go forward,” said Chris Laird, vice president of electric operations for Consumers Energy.\n\nThe utility is encouraging residents to charge their electronic devices and prepare emergency kits.\n\n“Make sure that you're charging your phones, make sure that you've got bottled water, make sure that your cars are fueled up,” Laird added. “I know that people sometimes it will get in their car to warm up. Make sure your cars are outside of your garage into a well-ventilated space in order to be able to do that.”\n\nUtility officials are asking customers to report downed power lines by calling 911 and Consumers Energy.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecasts seven to ten straight days of below freezing temperatures statewide, with frequent lake effect snow showers and subzero wind chills lasting into mid-week.\n\nA list of Michigan utility outages can be found on PowerOutage.us.\n\nShipping vessels across the Great Lakes are trying to make it through the Soo Locks ahead of a major winter storm.\n\nThe Great Lakes shipping season is still on schedule to close this Monday, despite blizzard conditions and 30-foot waves projected in northern Michigan over the weekend.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) told WCMU that 15 shipping vessels have arrived at the locks and a dozen more are on the way to Sault Ste. Marie, carrying products like iron ore and taconite.\n\nJeff Harrington is the USACE Operations Branch Chief in the Soo. He said ships in Lake Superior must leave by midnight this Sunday to make it to the Straits of Mackinac.\n\n“We'll remain in service until those vessels complete their lockage, that may bleed slightly into the 16th given the anticipated call-in times that we're tracking right now,” said Harrington. “We're working very closely with the shipping companies to stay abreast of their locations and departure times and ensure we get them through the locks.”\n\nWCMU recently reported that ice coverage on the Great Lakes was at a 50-year low in early January. But Coast Guard officials told WCMU the change in the weather patterns is leading to ice formation throughout the Great Lakes.\n\nIce breakers are now stationed around the region and are on standby if vessels need assistance getting through ports before the shipping season ends Monday.\n\nA study from the Council on the Great Lakes region concluded that if the Great Lakes shipping industry was its own country, it would be the third largest economy in the world based on a gross domestic product of $6 trillion.\n\nEric Peace is the Vice President of the Lake Carriers Association, a group that represents commercial shippers.\n\nHe said the potential economic impact of delays can be significant, as companies prepare to replenish their inventories ahead of the two-month break.\n\n\"I think the number last year was $126 million, which we were investing in those facilities around the Great Lakes,\" said Peace.\n\nAn incoming winter storm is predicted to bring high winds and drop 10 to 16 inches of snow in northeast lower Michigan.\n\nAlpena is in the center, forecasted to have blizzard conditions. County officials say they have a full crew on standby this weekend to keep the roads safe.\n\nRyan Brege, the managing director of the county’s road commission (ACRC), said up to 20 vehicles are ready to plow and salt the roads. He said the ACRC is also prepared to pull in additional drivers, but road maintenance is contingent on the severity of winter conditions.\n\n\"In the event, we do get the blizzard, there is a good chance we have to pull our crews off the road completely,” Brege said. “We don't need them out there in a situation, where they can't see and run the risk of causing an accident or being in an accident.\"\n\nBrege said he encourages residents to play it safe and make \"every effort\" to stay home.\n\n\"We've had times in the past where folks have gotten stuck on roads we're trying to get through, and we don't wait for them to get out. We will not pull them out. And we have to turn around and go somewhere else. That leaves that road without treatment.\"\n\nAvoiding roads is best, but if residents choose to go out, they are advised to drive slowly and keep their distance from other cars.\n\nAs communities across Michigan prepare for a major winter storm, the demand for roadside assistance is expected to surge.\n\nAAA Michigan said drivers who can't avoid travel can prepare by checking their car's tire pressure, wiper blades, and battery strength.\n\nAdrienne Woodland, a spokesperson for AAA Michigan, said drivers should utilize caution when driving in bad weather conditions.\n\n“Be sure to have at least a half tank of gas and significantly reduce your speed,” Woodland said. “You always want to drive at a safe speed that matches the prevailing visibility, traffic and road conditions, even if that means driving below the posted speed limit.\"\n\nWoodland added that drivers should keep emergency items in their vehicles such as a first aid kit, extra blankets and plenty of water and food.\n\nWinter storm warnings are posted for the entire WCMU listening area through Saturday evening. In northeast lower Michigan, blizzard warnings have been issued by the Weather Service. Snow will gradually spread into the area during the day.\n\nThe Tri-Cities are expecting six to 11 inches of snow.\n\nThe rest of mid-Michigan, northwest lower Michigan, the upper peninsula and Ontario will see eight to 14 inches of snow.\n\nNortheast lower Michigan will see even more: 10 to 15 inches on average, with locally higher amounts.\n\nVery strong winds are also expected statewide during this storm, which will cause widespread blowing and drifting snow.\n\n\"We're looking at gusts at this point of 35-45, maybe a little bit higher, miles per hour possible,\" said Patrick Bach, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gaylord. \"Blowing snow is going to be a major concern.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials are asking everyone to stay home if you can. Temperatures on Friday will be around 30 degrees Fahrenheit for the lower peninsula. In the upper peninsula, expect temperatures around 20 degrees Fahrenheit or -6 degrees Celsius in Ontario.\n\nTonight, snow continues, and will be heavy at times. Travel will be dangerous, if not impossible, during the overnight hours.\n\nOvernight temperatures in the lower peninsula will be around 20-25 degrees Fahrenheit, low-teens for the upper peninsula and -10 degrees Celsius in Ontario."
