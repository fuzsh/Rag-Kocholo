        "text": "WATERTOWN, New York (WWNY) - Close on the heels of a windstorm that left tens of thousands of north country residents in the dark, we could see more of the same over the weekend.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for Jefferson, Lewis and St. Lawrence counties. High wind warnings have been issued for Jefferson and Lewis counties, and a high wind advisory for part of St. Lawrence County.\n\nAs of 6 p.m. Friday, there were fewer than 200 National Grid customers without power in Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties. The company expects to have all of them back online by Friday evening.\n\nThat’s just hours before the warnings begin to kick in.\n\nHere’s how it breaks down:\n\nJefferson & Lewis counties\n\nThere’s a high wind warning for the two counties from 10 p.m. Friday until 4 a.m. on Sunday. Southeast winds from 25 to 35 mph could gust to 60 mph.\n\nDamaging winds could blow down trees and power lines. Widespread power outages are expected. Travel will be difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles.\n\nThen, there’s the snow.\n\nThere’s a winter storm warning for both counties from 4 p.m. on Saturday until 1 p.m. on Monday.\n\nForecasters say heavy lake effect snow is possible with accumulations of 1 to 3 feet where the snowfall is most persistent. Most of the snow is expected across the Tug Hill region.\n\nThe National Weather Service says blizzard conditions will be possible at times, especially Saturday night and Sunday. Wind gusts as high as 60 miles per hour are possible.\n\nSt. Lawrence County\n\nSoutheastern St. Lawrence County has a wind advisory from 11 p.m. Friday to 11 a.m. on Saturday. Southeast winds of 25-35 mph could gust to 50-55 mph.\n\nThe strong winds could blow around unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down and cause isolated power outages.\n\nA winter storm warning has been issued for the southwestern part of the county from 4 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Monday.\n\nThe area could see 5 to 15 inches of snow."
