        "text": "Syracuse, N.Y. -- Onondaga County has now been upgraded to a lake effect storm warning that starts Tuesday morning for potentially heavy snow and strong winds.\n\nThe National Weather Service now predicts that the Syracuse area could get 5 to 9 inches of snow from tonight through Wednesday morning. That’s a slight bump from Sunday’s forecast, and enough to raise the alert level from watch to warning.\n\n“The heaviest snowfall will occur Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday night,” the warning said. “The higher snowfall amounts are expected to occur in the northern portions of Onondaga County, including Syracuse.”\n\nWind gusts up to 35 mph could blow snow around and make travel difficult.\n\n“The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening commute,” the weather service warned.\n\nWinds from the west are expected to blow across the Great Lakes, dropping as much as 30 inches on the Tug Hill Plateau and nearly 2 feet in the southwest corner of the state.\n\nLight snow could start this morning south of Buffalo and this evening in Central New York and the North Country."
