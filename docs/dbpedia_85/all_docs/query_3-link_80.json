        "text": "Kawartha Lakes – The City of Kawartha Lakes has declared a Significant Weather Event per O. Reg. 239/02 of the Municipal Act 2001.\n\nOn Friday, the municipality was hit with a winter storm. Today, Sunday January 14, Environment Canada has issued a warning for a second winter weather event, a snow squall, for Kawartha Lakes and area.\n\nWhile Public Works staff were able to maintain compliance with Minimum Maintenance Standards (MMS) during and after Friday’s weather event, there is potential that they will not be able to meet the Minimum Maintenance Standard and Council Policy targets during this significant weather event due to the increased accumulation of snow, sustained blowing winds, and staff accumulating hours of service that will potentially limit their availability to perform winter maintenance activity during and after this second storm.\n\nResidents are advised to use caution if travel is necessary as they may experience poor road conditions during the significant weather event. Staff will actively manage resources in an attempt to achieve MMS compliance as soon as possible.\n\nAll available resources remain deployed to address road conditions.\n\nWhat does declaring a Significant Weather Event mean?\n\nAs per Regulation 239/02 of the Municipal Act 2001, an Ontario municipality may declare a significant weather event when a weather hazard is approaching or occurring and has the potential to pose a significant danger to users of the highways in which they have authority over. This declaration suspends the standard timelines required for municipalities to meet their winter maintenance objectives until the municipality declares the significant weather event has ended.\n\nRead our Winter Control Roadway Level of Service Policy and Sidewalk Level of Service Policy - Winter Maintenance for more information about winter control practices in Kawartha Lakes.\n\nEnvironment Canada has issued the following Snow Squall Warnings for Kawartha Lakes:\n\nKawartha Lakes (Lindsay)\n\nHeavy snow squall expected near Lake Simcoe this afternoon into early this evening. This snow squall warning replaces the winter weather travel advisory previously in effect.\n\nHazards:\n\nLake effect snow bands producing local accumulations of 10 to 15 cm.\n\nPeak snowfall rates of 2 to 3 cm per hour.\n\nReduced visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nTiming:\n\nThrough this afternoon and ending this evening.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nLake effect snow will impact areas near Lake Simcoe this afternoon before moving north of the region this evening.\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nConsider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve.\n\nKawartha Lakes (Fenelon Falls)\n\nSnow squalls continue to affect the region.\n\nHazards:\n\nLocally heavy snowfall with total accumulations of 15 to 60 cm by later tonight.\n\nPeak snowfall rates possibly exceeding 5 cm per hour at times.\n\nPoor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nTiming:\n\nEnding later tonight or early Monday morning.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nSnow squalls have shifted south of Muskoka and southern Haliburton region but will shift northward into the area again this evening. For areas further south near Barrie, snow squalls are expected to move northward out of the area tonight.\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@ec.gc.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\n- 30 –\n\nMedia Inquiries"
