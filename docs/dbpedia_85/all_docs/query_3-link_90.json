        "text": "OTTAWA COUNTY â€” It's beginning to look a lot more like winter in West Michigan.\n\nThe weekend's snowfall has stuck around with temperatures hovering around freezing, and forecasters are expecting another half a foot of snow to fall by Friday with a winter storm that arrives in the Great Lakes from the northwest Wednesday.\n\nMuch of the West Michigan lakeshore, including Ottawa, Allegan, Kent, Muskegon, Mason, Lake, Oceana and Newaygo counties, was placed under a winter storm warning for 4 a.m. Wednesday to 7 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Grand Rapids office warned the winter storm could produce \"near blizzard conditions,\" with strong winds and lake effect snow fall that may be heavy at times.\n\nTotal expected snow accumulation is between 4 and 9 inches and wind gusts could be as high as 50 miles per hour in southwest and west central Michigan. Areas west of and along U.S.-131 are expected to see the worst conditions, the NWS said.\n\nMore: Local road commission keeping an eye on snow plow driver staff as winter looms\n\nMore: MiSustainable Holland: Control winter salt and sand to keep our water clean\n\nThe storm could affect road travel with snow-covered or ice-covered roads and reduced visibility, including possible whiteout conditions. Scattered power outages are also possible during the storm, the NWS warned.\n\nCold temperatures are expected to accompany the snowfall. Temperatures are predicted to drop during the day from the low 30s to 19 degrees Fahrenheit in Holland by 4 p.m. Wednesday. The colder temperatures continue through Thursday and Friday with highs in the low 20s and and lows of 12 degrees and 10 degrees, respectively.\n\nSnow may continue throughout the day Thursday and into Thursday night along the lakeshore.\n\nThe NWS said it was difficult to predict snowfall totals for Wednesday and Thursday but the heaviest snowfall is expected around the U.S.-131 corridor.\n\nA winter storm warning was also issued for counties in the northern lower peninsula, Leelanau, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Manistee and Wexford counties and Beaver Island, with expected snow accumulation of 5 to 10 inches in that region."
