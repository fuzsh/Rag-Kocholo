It's still creating chaos on roads and ski resorts as heavy snow and fierce winds slam the high country.\n\nMeantime in the Bay Area, cold overnight temperatures are prompting some communities to help its most vulnerable populations.\n\nFierce blizzard conditions created a 'snowmageddon' in the high Sierra this weekend. Whiteout conditions and hurricane-force winds unfolded at the top of Donner Summit, where some stranded drivers had to be rescued by CHP. Interstate 80 in both directions remained closed Sunday afternoon.\n\nOn Highway 50, Caltrans says a snow slide on Echo Summit trapped several cars and closed the road for about 30 minutes. Luckily, no one was hurt.\n\nBay Area resident Renee Adelmann was riding out the blizzard in South Lake Tahoe, where wind and blowing snow has been relentless.\n\n\"It snowed all day yesterday. Then we woke up to about a foot and a half of fresh snow. This is my neighbor's house right here. Snow is up to the door,\" Adelmann said.\n\nBut many roads are still too dangerous for travel. One skier had the right idea to get around on Venice Drive in Tahoe Keys.\n\n\"It's not safe to be coming up here right now. People will have to wait until next week when everything is cleared out,\" Adelmann said.\n\nConditions were unreal at the Gondola Station at Palisades Tahoe, which had to close on Sunday.\n\nHeavenly Resort was open and thousands of skiers showed up to enjoy some fresh powder.\n\nDigging out could take a while. Kevin Dupui was trying to clear a path in Truckee but not having much luck.\n\n\"We started to blow the snow with the snow blower, but I might have broken it and my buddy is trying to fix it and get it running,\" Dupui said.\n\nIn the Bay Area, no snow but cold temps were a concern in the Sonoma Valley for the unhoused overnight. An emergency warming shelter is now open.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in the Sonoma Valley, we don't have permanent winter shelters, so we're establishing an emergency winter shelter that we can open as needed,\" said Sonoma City Manager David Guhin.\n\nNoon: Here's the latest on ski resorts closures\n\nPalisades - Closed\n\nSierra-at-Tahoe - Closed\n\nHomewood - Closed\n\nMt. Rose Ski Tahoe - Closed\n\nHeavenly - Some lifts reopened\n\nKirkwood - Some lifts reopened\n\nSugar Bowl - Some lifts opened\n\nNorthstar - Some lifts reopened\n\n10:20 a.m. Highway 50 reopens following snowslide, Caltrans says\n\nCaltrans said Highway 50 reopened at 8:52 a.m. Sunday after an earlier snowslide at Echo Summit.\n\nThe agency said traffic is moving slowly in both directions.

This round of cold air has prompted places across the Bay Area to open warming shelters. For those staying the shelters, they say they save lives.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know where I would be tonight,\" said Alpha, a woman staying at the shelter. \"It's hard out there when you don't have shelter, and this is great for all of us who stay here.\"\n\nChrist Episcopal Church usually opens up its recreation space a few days a week in the winter to help those who have no place to stay. The storms last year were so intense, it expanded its operations. This year it is opened through March 14.\n\n\"It is a space where they can be cared for,\" said Alisa Rasera, co-chair of social justice at the church. \"Get food, get connected to the greater community and hopefully get some more resources too to lead them towards paths for housing.\"\n\nThe shelter at the church isn't the only place opening its doors. In Sonoma, the city is opening its warming center for those who need it.\n\n\"It has a tent, heaters, beds, it's there for whoever needs it,\" said David Guhin, Sonoma city manager. \"We realized the cold temperatures -- especially with the wind chill in the early mornings last night and tomorrow -- warranted us to do something for our most vulnerable population.\"\n\nFor those living in the shelter, it isn't just about avoiding the cold and the rain, it is also about avoiding the stress of not knowing where to stay.\n\n\"It means a lot to me,\" Alpha said. \"It is almost like opening a key to a door to your own apartment, but it is not yours, but almost like that. Safety.\"\n\n9 p.m. Road closure reported in Aptos Hills area due to fallen tree: CHP\n\nSanta Cruz California Highway Patrol is advising drivers to take alternative routes due to a fallen tree blocking Larkin Valley Road and Wildwood Drive in the Aptos Hills area.\n\nThere is currently no estimated time for reopening.\n\n6:55 p.m. Tornado Warning issued for parts of South Bay, central coast, NWS says\n\nA tornado warning, a rarity in the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast, was issued Saturday evening by the National Weather Service.\n\nAt 6:29 p.m., a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located near Prunedale, in Monterey County, about nine miles south of Gilroy, moving east at 40 mph, forecasters said.\n\nOther areas threatened by the tornadic thunderstorm included Aromas in Monterey County and San Juan Batista in San Benito County, the weather service said.\n\nPeople in the affected area were advised to take cover, moving to a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.\n\nIf outdoors, in a mobile home, or in a vehicle, forecasters advised moving to the closest substantial shelter.\n\n6 p.m. Emergency shelters opening in Santa Cruz Co. for unhoused residents\n\nThree special shelters will open Sunday in Santa Cruz County to protect the homeless from a severe weather system and possible flooding, officials said.\n\nShelters at Depot Park in Santa Cruz and Watsonville Veterans Hall will operate around the clock beginning at 8 p.m. Sunday until 8 a.m. Tuesday, the county said in a statement Saturday.\n\nA shelter at the Santa Cruz Veterans Hall will operate from 8 p.m. Sunday until 8 a.m. Monday, and from 10 p.m. Monday until 8 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nLineup for shelter services begins one hour prior to shelters openings, the county said.\n\nParticipants will be provided with cots, blankets, and ready-to-eat meals.

Mountain locals and Bay Area residents are hunkering down and digging out.\n\nInterstate 80, remained closed Saturday over Donner Summit. The dangerous winter storm was slamming the Sierra with rare blizzard conditions, creating a bone-chilling mess. Trucks on Interstate 80 were stranded in heavy snow.\n\nThe CHP says emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time reaching drivers.\n\nRenee Adelmann from Marin County is riding out the blizzard in South Lake Tahoe.\n\n\"Our house was rocking last night. There were gale force winds, windows were creaking. It was the worst I've seen in a few years,\" Adelmann said.\n\nDigging out will be challenging.\n\n\"This is our neighbor's house by the way. The snow is halfway up their door. We brought groceries and supplies so we didn't have to go the grocery store. We figured we'd stay home and see how ski conditions are tomorrow,\" Adelmann said.\n\nSki resorts like Palisades Tahoe were closed Saturday due to severe weather and unreal wind gusts.\n\n\"Overnight on Siberia Ridge, the top of our mountain, we had winds up to 190 mph. Pretty sure that's hurricane force winds,\" said Palisades Tahoe spokesperson Maddy Condon.\n\n\"We're obviously going to be seeing a lot of this today. My neighbors are digging out,\" said Randy Davis, retired ABC7 News photographer.\n\nDavis lives in Truckee where the snow is being measured in feet.\n\n\"I'm walking on the deck in over two feet of powder, light snow but there's a significant amount of it. We filled our car with gas, not that we're going to go anywhere. It looks like it might be a while before anyone gets out of town,\" Davis said.\n\n1:30 p.m. Parts of SR 9 near Saratoga closed due to debris caused by unstable hillside, Caltrans says\n\nCaltrans announced the closure of State Route 9 from Sanborn Road to Redwood Gulch Road near Saratoga in Santa Clara County after it was blocked by debris due to an unstable hillside, according to a Friday press release.\n\nThe road is expected to reopen after Caltrans removes the debris from the road, but timing is unknown due to the active landslide and upcoming severe weather.\n\n11:50 a.m. Sonoma County health officials issue cold weather warning\n\nThe County of Sonoma issued a cold weather warning on Saturday in response to the National Weather Service frost advisory from midnight to 9 a.m. Sunday.\n\nHealth officials said the National Weather Service is predicting sub-freezing wind chill temperatures from Saturday into early Sunday.\n\nOfficials recommend that residents limit time outdoors, as serious medical conditions including hypothermia and frostbite can develop with prolonged cold weather exposure.\n\nIndividuals who are unhoused are advised moving to their nearest shelter, if possible, officials said.

It's been one after another. If you drive around, people are just clearing snow.\"\n\nAnd the storm was already threatening to take out his home's power early in the evening. \"We had a very close call earlier where we started to lose power, but luckily didn't. It just flashed and came back,\" explained Davis. \"I think right now we're probably getting two or three inches an hour probably. So yeah - it's coming in.\"\n\nAnd as the storm comes in, the black bears are coming out of hibernation.\n\n\"They're coming out already - they don't care what the weather is like, they don't care that there's going to be a snowstorm,\" said Ann Bryant, executive director of BEAR League, a nonprofit working to keep Lake Tahoe's black bears safe.\n\n\"People think as long as there is snow the bears are going to stay in hibernation and every year they're just shocked when they'll leave a cooler outside or food in their car, and they'll say, 'well I thought they were sleeping,'\" said Bryant, who is ready to hunker down for at least a few days.\n\n\"We keep hearing this is going to be the storm of the century and it hasn't disappointed,\" said Bryant, who has lived in the area for more than 40 years. \"It's been blowing, whiteouts accumulating, and it's pretty ferocious.\"\n\n6:30 p.m. Sierra blizzard warning brings pleas to avoid travel\n\nA rare California blizzard is creating chaos in the high country Friday bringing near whiteout conditions to parts of the Sierra near Lake Tahoe.\n\nRoad conditions have been changing by the hour. Caltrans has a checkpoint set up in Applegate making sure big rig drivers have chains for the journey. But some truckers forgot to pack them.\n\n\"I couldn't go any further because I didn't have them, said Truck Driver Auddie Schrick.\n\nTrucker Jason Dal Bianco is headed to Salt Lake City.\n\n\"I'm expecting to put on chains, I'm hoping the local government will let us know if it's safe to go other the pass,\" said Dal Bianco.\n\nTony Skeonik didn't wasn't aware of the the severe weather.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I have go to Reno and turn around and come back so I'm hoping for safe travels,\" said Skeonik.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol has closed down I-80 in both directions over Donner Summit.

Caltrans, the National Weather Service and now even ski resorts are warning people that it's just not safe to drive up to the Sierra in these conditions right now.\n\nHighway 80 at Highway 89 has lots of snow that still needs to be cleared off the highway. Drivers there have a slow go around Friday morning.\n\nIt was a similar story in Truckee overnight. Video taken between 1 and 3 a.m. shows snow plows already out working to clear the roads after the area was slammed with snow overnight.\n\nThe National Weather Service says up to 12 feet of snow is expected to fall in the Tahoe area over a 72-hour period. Coop, a spokesperson for Cali Pass Resorts which represents multiple ski resorts, is urging skiers eager to hit the slopes to think twice about their plans.\n\n\"Do not come up, not now, it's too much, you don't want to put the burden on Caltrans and CHP, the resorts are not going to be able to open,\" Kevin \"Coop\" Cooper says. \"They will try, maybe some of their lower elevation lifts but the winds associated and with the amount of snow that we're going to see, give the mountain teams a break.\"\n\nFor safety, Palisades Tahoe will close the Alpine side of the resort Friday and Heavenly has closed for the day because of the forecasted winds.\n\nResorts are instead encouraging drivers to head up after the storm passes on Monday.\n\n4:30 a.m. Parts of the Sierra Nevada likely to get 10 feet of snow from powerful storm by weekend\n\nThe most powerful Pacific storm of the season is forecast to bring up to 10 feet of snow into the Sierra Nevada by the weekend, forcing residents to take shelter and prompting Yosemite National Park and at least one Lake Tahoe ski resort to close.\n\nThe storm began barreling into the region on Thursday, with the biggest effects expected to close major highways and trigger power outages Friday afternoon into Saturday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 300-mile (482-kilometer) stretch from north of Lake Tahoe to south of Yosemite National Park.\n\n\"Your safe travel window is over in the Sierra,\" the National Weather Service in Reno posted Thursday morning on social media. \"Best to hunker down where you are.\"\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n11 p.m. Local snowboarders, skiers avoiding travel to Sierra\n\nAt Sports Basement in Sunnyvale, some snowboarders and skiers said they're avoiding travel to the mountains.\n\nMilpitas resident Jason Ting was boarding in Tahoe this past weekend. \"I'm staying away from that this weekend I think there's like 5-8 feet of snow,\" Ting said. And he's not wrong.\n\nOthers feel like they're going to be missing out on the fresh snowfall. San Jose resident Kathleen Pittman wish she could be there - but is looking forward to going this season. \"As a newer snowboarder it's definitely easier to snowboard on fresh powder and fresh snow it makes the falls a little bit easier to take. So it's just really exciting and have everyone out there,\" Pittman said.\n\nDepending on weather and demand, Sports Basement will run several Ski Buses that give snow enthusiasts a ride straight from the Bay Area to the slopes.\n\nLast weekend they launched 23 buses. Phil Gor is the program director for Sports Basement Outdoors. \"So this weekend we're going to be cancelling Saturday - it's kind of a no brainer with all the storms and you know we're looking at 80-90 mph winds on Saturday- Sunday is question mark- so we're planning to run buses but if it's safe,\" Gor said. Sports Basement will be adding what they're calling Powder Buses on Monday to take advantage after the storms. \"Up and back in one day. We drive, you sleep is our little motto there,\" Gor said. San Jose resident Black Ochs said taking the ski bus is a great way to go. \"That's allowed me the opportunity to meet people on the way up before I even get to the mountain,\" Ochs said.\n\nBuses take off at 5 a.m. at different Sports Basement locations in Sunnyvale, Bryant Street in San Francisco and Berkeley. \"When you arrive they have Red Bulls for you in case you're still a little bit groggy from waking up from the ride. And then you go out and ride six, seven, eight hours once you get back down to the bus they have some refreshments,\" Ochs said.\n\nThose who are snow-bound are looking forward to what Mother Nature will bring.\n\n5:45 p.m. North Bay communities open cold weather shelters as rain approaches\n\nThe approaching cold wet, weather has some North Bay communities gearing up to help their most vulnerable populations stay warm and dry during the storm.\n\n\"You can't stay out there all day long without a meal in your stomach,\" said Sam Ojebola.\n\nOjebola is making sure that about 100 of his unhoused clients are getting a hot lunch.\n\nOn a cold, rainy day like this Ojebola opened his Jesus Cares 2020 dining room in Santa Rosa about four hours earlier to keep folks dry.\n\n\"Because we are all human. Living outside when it's cold during this time and weather is not good for someone's health,\" Ojebola said.\n\nToby Reville is staying in a local shelter at night, but he can't stay there during the day, so he's on his own on the streets.\n\n\"I'm actually trying to get to a place where I can get a warm drink, coffee until I can go back there,\" Reville said.\n\nA crew from FS Global Solutions was preparing a giant tent that will be heated and used as an overnight warming shelter in the town of Sonoma this weekend. The company provides outreach services to North Bay communities.\n\n\"Set up cots, bring coffee and hot drinks, water and food to try and give people a place where they can shelter from the storm,\" said Max Morell-Foege from FS Global Solutions.\n\n\"We are anticipating this weekend, based on the National Weather Service wind chill temps and wet weather, we want to make sure we have space to our vulnerable population,\" said Sonoma City Manager David Guhin.\n\nEscaping the rain and cold is what Reville will try to do this weekend. He just relocated to Santa Rosa from Pennsylvania.\n\n\"My heart goes out to each and every homeless person. They really get the short end of the stick,\" Reville said.\n\n5 p.m. Blizzard conditions expected to bump up Sierra snowpack, CA water supply levels\n\nThis weekend's blizzard is expected to bring an epic amount of snow to the Sierra and that is great for the snowpack.\n\nOn Thursday, the third snow survey of the year was conducted at Philips station.\n\nState water officials talked about where California's snow and reservoir levels stand.\n\nMarcus Shelksohn of San Francisco can't wait to head to Lake Tahoe to hit the slopes.\n\n\"Going skiing, snowboarding. Trying to get my daughter up to the snow for the first time,\" Shelksohn said.\n\nShelksohn and many others know this incoming storm will bring lots of fresh powder.\n\nAnd that's great news for the Sierra snowpack.\n\nBecause of the big storm coming, officials decided to conduct the snow survey on Thursday -- a day early -- near Lake Tahoe.\n\n\"Our snow survey today, we recorded a depth of about 47.5 inches, about four feet we are standing on. And a snow water content of 18 inches. That's about a foot and a half,\" said Andy Reising, an engineer with California Department of Water Resources. \"If you took 48 inches and melted it down, that's essentially 18 inches of liquid water.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, the CA Department of Water Resources announced that its statewide snow pack is currently 80% of normal for this time of year. Last month, the statewide snow pack was 52% of normal\n\nOn Jan. 1, the California Sierra snowpack was just 28% of normal.\n\nState water experts say the approaching storm could bring the snow levels up to average.\n\nThat's important, because during the summer, melting snow flows into the state's water table and fills reservoirs around California.\n\nThe statewide Sierra snowpack makes up about a third California's water supply. The recent atmospheric river storms have really boosted snow and water levels.\n\nAccording to the map we have tracking reservoir capacity, Lake Berryessa is at 92% capacity.\n\nHetch Hetchy Reservoir is at 90%.\n\n\"We are hoping to get some contributions to the snow pack from the storm that will bump that number,\" said Jeanine Jones, CA Department of Water Resources interstate resources manager.\n\nBack to Marcus Shelksohn, he's just focused on one thing.\n\n\"Get ready to go for some deep snow,\" Shelksohn said.\n\n4 p.m. Yosemite National Park announces closures amid Blizzard Warning\n\nYosemite National Park will be fully closed starting at 12:01 a.m. on Friday due to the anticipated weather conditions.\n\nPark officials say they will re-assess the situation at 12 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nFull story here.\n\n3 p.m. Oakland Zoo closing Friday due to weather\n\nOakland Zoo announced it would be closing Friday, March 1 due to wet weather conditions.\n\n1 p.m. PG &E warns of potential power outages ahead of storm\n\nPG &E is warning of potential power outages in the Bay Area as a storm moves through the region Thursday through Sunday with persistent rain, heavy wind and even a rare blizzard warning further inland.\n\nWinds could reach speeds of between 30-40 mph on Thursday while rain will intensify into Friday and continue throughout the weekend. Between 1.5-2 inches are forecast for San Francisco.\n\nDalton Behringer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the rain will cause moderate soil saturation, but he did not anticipate as significant problems as past storms with tree uprooting.\n\nPG &E is staging crews and equipment in advance of the storm to expedite any repair work that is needed, but the utility warned that residents in remote, elevated areas could face days without power.\n\nSnow is forecast for elevations above 2,000 feet and a few inches are forecast for Mt. Diablo in Contra Costa County.\n\nRoad conditions in the Sierra foothills are expected to deteriorate rapidly on Friday as a blizzard warning is in effect from 4 a.m. Thursday to 10 a.m. Sunday. Driving conditions are forecast to be \"nearly impossible,\" according to the Weather Service. Drivers are urged not to travel in the area. Closures are anticipated on Interstate Highway 80 and U.S. Highway 50.\n\nA high surf advisory from the Weather Service is also in effect for coastal areas from 10 a.m. Friday to 4 p.m. Saturday. Waves between 15-20 feet are forecast from the North Bay down to the Central Coast.\n\n\"The west-facing beaches are going to see the worst, so people need to be careful going out there,\" said Behringer.\n\nHe reminded beachgoers to not turn their back to the water and to be aware that waves can gather and break faster than anticipated during high surf events.\n\nPG &E has an updated outage map that can be accessed here.\n\nPG &E also reminded the public to never touch downed wires, use flashlights rather than candles if power goes out in the home, and to have a portable charging device for a cellphone.\n\n11 a.m. Blizzard warning in effect for Sierra Nevada\n\nThe National Weather Service said Thursday morning that a blizzard warning is in effect for areas above 2,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada east of Sacramento through Sunday.\n\nCaltrans officials said just before 9 a.m. that chain controls are in effect on eastbound Interstate Highway 80 from Kingvale to Truckee and westbound from Truckee to Rainbow.\n\nAccording to Caltrans, eastbound traffic on Highway 80 is being turned away at Kingvale and Drum Forebay in Placer County because of an overturned truck. Trucks are being turned back at Applegate. Caltrans officials said there is no estimated time of reopening.\n\nForecasters said conditions will begin to deteriorate quickly in the mountains Thursday afternoon, with high winds and heavy snow causing white-out conditions at times.\n\nThe weather service said it's already snowing heavily over the Sierra and isn't expected to let up for the next three days. Forecasters expect 5 to 10 feet of snow above 5,000 feet and 1 to 4 feet above 3,000 feet.\n\nSnowfall will be heaviest Thursday afternoon and evening and Friday afternoon. Wind gusts in the mountains are expected to reach up to 75 mph.\n\nPeople in mountain areas can expect downed trees and power lines and extended power outages.\n\nForecasters asked drivers to stay off mountain roads, if possible, until the arriving storm is gone on Sunday.
