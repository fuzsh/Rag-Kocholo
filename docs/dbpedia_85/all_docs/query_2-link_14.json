        "text": "Winter weather advisories are in place for parts of 13 states as meteorologists predict another bout of lake-effect snow to befall the Great Lakes, while the northeast is hammered with another Pacific winter storm.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued alerts for Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nWinter storm warnings are also in place for parts of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming due to another Pacific storm—which brought freezing rain to the Portland area—dumping snow on mountain regions in the northwest at rates exceeding two inches an hour. The region has already been battered by a series of powerful atmospheric river storms.\n\nThe arrival of an Arctic blast of cold air over the weekend brought dangerously cold chills to central states and facilitated winter storms elsewhere, including a wintry mix of precipitation in the southeast and lake-effect snow downwind of the Great Lakes. Another surge of Arctic air is predicted to arrive by the end of the week.\n\nRegions downwind of the Great Lakes have recently been subject to heavy snow due to the effect, with as much as three feet falling over parts of western New York that border Lakes Erie and Ontario over the weekend, following several similar bouts earlier in the winter.\n\nWhen a mass of cold air moves over a relatively warm body of water, that heat and moisture rises before being cooled by the cold air to form low-lying clouds, which produce heavy snow when they reach land.\n\nIn its latest forecast, the NWS said that a cold northwesterly flow would bring bands of heavy lake-effect snow of up to three feet through Thursday night, with areas downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario of particular concern.\n\n\"Another system should bring a renewed round of at least some light snow chances to the Midwest by Thursday,\" it added.\n\nLake-effect snow of up to six inches is expected in parts of northwestern New York bordering Lake Ontario, with the possibility of locally higher totals approaching 10 inches.\n\nUp to eight inches of snow is anticipated across parts of Michigan bordering Lakes Michigan and Superior. The heaviest snowfall is predicted along the Lake Superior shoreline, with Keweenaw and Houghton counties—which extend into the lake—seeing up to 11 inches of snow with wind chills that could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nAn additional inch of snow is possible in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, including the tribal lands of the Red Cliff Band, where wind chills will reach minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Similar conditions are expected for southwest Michigan near Lake Michigan and bordering Indiana.\n\nAs winter storms continue for the northwest, up to 10 inches of snow could fall at higher elevations of Yosemite National Park in California; up to 16 inches in north central Utah; and up to 18 inches in the Ruby Mountains and Humboldt Range of Nevada.\n\nAs much as three feet of snow is possible in mountain regions of southern and western Wyoming, while two feet is anticipated at higher elevations of west central Colorado.\n\nSimilarly, up to two feet of snow is possible at higher elevations in Montana, with much of the state affected by the adverse weather. Up to the same amount is expected in northern and southwestern Idaho.\n\nAs much as 20-28 inches of snow is expected across the mountain ranges of Oregon and Washington, with freezing rain leading to ice accumulation."
