        "text": "Humidity Levels Drop Over The Weekend; Cooler Nights\n\nMOSTLY DRY WEATHER CONTINUES: The chance of any one spot seeing rain across Alabama today remains 10 percent or less; with a partly sunny sky we project a high in the low 90s for most places this afternoon. We note the average high for Birmingham on August 9 is 91.\n\nRead More\n\nA Look at the Tropics: Debby and Something New?\n\nWe are still talking about Debby on this Thursday evening….and we may have something new on the horizon.\n\nRead More\n\nIsolated Showers Over East Alabama; Lower Humidity By The Weekend\n\nRADAR CHECK: We note a few small, isolated showers over the eastern third of Alabama this afternoon; the rest of the state is dry. Clouds cover much of West Alabama, where temperatures are only in the 80s. Where the sun is out over the eastern and southern counties temperatures are in the low to mid 90s.\n\nRead More\n\nThursday Afternoon Tropical Update: A Tornado and Significant Flood Threat Continues with Debby; Active Hurricane Season Likely to Continue\n\nQuick update this afternoon on Debby. As of the 1pm CDT update, the center of Debby was centered about 55 miles ESE of Charlotte, NC. Max winds at 40 mph. It is moving NNE at 10 mph. An increase in forward speed is still forecast and by Saturday, Debby will be over Atlantic Canada.\n\nRead More\n\nMidday Nowcast: Improvements in the Drought across Alabama\n\nFor today and tomorrow highs will be in the mid 90s across much of the state. Rain chances are near zero each day as well, but an isolated, pop-up shower or storm is always possible.\n\nRead More\n\nGov. Ivey announces appointments to the Alabama Growth Alliance\n\nGov. Kay Ivey today announced the appointment of eight distinguished business leaders to the Alabama Growth Alliance, a key initiative aimed at supporting efforts to drive economic growth and innovation through the governor’s new economic development strategy.\n\nRead More\n\nThursday Morning Debby Update: Numerous Flash Flood Warnings in the Carolinas\n\nTropical storm Debby made a second landfall during the wee hours of the morning near Bulls Bay, SC. It is starting to pick up the pace at 7 mph. A continued acceleration is expected and Debby will be in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.\n\nRead More\n\nLower Humidity Levels This Weekend; Showers Remain Scarce\n\nHOT SUMMER WEATHER: Alabama’s weather won’t change much through tomorrow with mostly sunny hot afternoons; highs will be in the 91-95 degree range. Odds of any one place seeing a shower remain 10 percent or less as the dry pattern continues.\n\nRead More\n\nDebby Remains Off the SC Coast…But Not For Long\n\nThe latest advisory from the NHC keeps the maximum winds near 60 mph. It is slowly moving to the north at 3 mph. The center is 40 miles ESE of Charleston, SC.\n\nRead More\n\nHeat Levels Come Down A Bit This Weekend; Dry Pattern Continues\n\nHOT SUMMER DAY: Temperatures are in the 90s across Alabama this afternoon with a partly to mostly sunny sky. A few tiny, isolated showers have formed, but most of the state is dry. Tonight will be fair with a low in the 70s.\n\nRead More\n\nAfternoon Debby Update: Stronger Winds Found; Another Landfall by Thursday AM\n\nCurrently, the storm continues the slow movement at 3 mph to the northeast. Weak steering currents continue promote the crawl. The combination of a ridge east of Debby and a trough near the Great Lakes will help bring in a northward movement and an eventual acceleration. A second landfall along the South Carolina coast is expected sometime Thursday morning.\n\nRead More\n\nMidday Nowcast: Very Hot Hump Day\n\nHighs are in the upper 90s and low 100s expected today with a mainly sunny sky across Alabama. For tomorrow and Friday highs return to the mid 90s across much of the state.\n\nRead More\n\nWednesday AM Update: Debby Off the South Carolina Coast…\n\nIt’s another day of watching Debby. The storm is hanging out off the South Carolina Coast. There has been some drier air pulling into the system and that has helped to limit some of the convective bands.\n\nRead More\n\nDry Through The Weekend; Lower Heat Levels By Saturday\n\nDRY SUMMER PATTERN: The chance of any one spot seeing a shower across Alabama is ten percent or less through the weekend, and when odds are that low we don’t mention it in the forecast. We expect mostly sunny days and fair nights through Sunday as the dry pattern continues, and Tropical Storm Debby stays well to the east.\n\nRead More"
