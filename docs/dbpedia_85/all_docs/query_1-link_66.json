        "text": "I had one extra thing to be thankful for last Thursday. Like many of you, I had safely made it home the day before Thanksgiving, following a harrowing ride that included a winter’s worth of fishtailing and close calls with other vehicles whose drivers were also trying to get someplace on “getaway day.” The Weather Channel gang – who have annoyingly embraced the idea of naming snowstorms – called this one Cato. If they’d asked me, I would have come up with something that can’t be printed here.\n\nI knew better than to call my daughter and describe to her my travel ordeal. She lives in a Buffalo suburb and found herself pretty much in the epicenter of the nearly week-long, lake-effect blizzard. Her family was left to deal with 7 feet of snow. We got less than 7 inches. I believe I was wise not to draw any comparisons.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo apparently believes there’s something Albany can do that could ease future weather woes throughout the Empire State. After shuffling off to Buffalo to survey the mountains of snow, shake countless cold hands and serve coffee to emergency personnel in front of clicking cameras, Cuomo talked up plans for a new state weather detection system that he claims will provide a monitoring set-up more sophisticated than what the National Weather Service currently has in place for the state.\n\nThe system is part of an $18.7 million natural disaster strategy plan rolled out early this year. According to the governor, it’ll be the most reliable in the country, with more sensors, receptors and weather stations that’ll make it easier to detect shifts in weather patterns and water levels and will help predict flooding.\n\nCuomo had better hope the rollout of this new state weather system goes a lot more smoothly than his discussion of it while he was standing in the snow in Buffalo. He took a few swipes at the National Weather Service, saying they’d fallen short by not accurately predicting the storm’s timing and the rate at which the lake-effect snow would accumulate. He later backed off a bit after ticked-off meteorologists defended their forecast accuracy, reminding him that the NWS had issued several winter weather advisories leading up to western New York’s mega-snow event.\n\nBut while Cuomo says forecasters do the best with the information they have, he’s convinced a new statewide weather system will more accurately detect changes in the weather and disseminate that information more quickly. Skeptics aren’t so sure. They say even if similar systems in other states have been good at assessing current conditions, a network of sensors and additional weather stations can’t be depended on to predict weather days in advance, especially the type of storm that buried parts of Buffalo.\n\nAll this isn’t likely to provide much comfort to those of us who couldn’t help but feel more than a little depressed as we slid around on snowy roads last week. Even when we know what’s coming we still have to deal with it. And it’s not officially winter yet. That reality is something I’m not thankful for.\n\ntbaxter@th-record.com"
