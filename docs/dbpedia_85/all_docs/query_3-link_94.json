        "text": "A​ blast of arctic cold weather is taking hold as deadly Winter Storm Heather leaves a trail of ice and snow in the South, prompting school closures and travel warnings in several states, airport ground stops and flight delays across the country and pleas to conserve power in Texas.\n\nHeather’s next act is likely to bring the first significant snowfall in nearly two years to parts of the Northeast.\n\nG​et the full forecast for Winter Storm Heather here, and read more about the dangerous arctic cold here.\n\nH​ere are our live updates from Monday:\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has issued new ground stops at LaGuardia Airport in New York, Nashville Airport in Tennessee, and George Bush Airport in Houston, Texas.\n\nDelays are growing at several others while deicing operations are underway.\n\nAt Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C., delays are up to nearly 90 minutes due to snow and ice mitigation.\n\nAs Winter Storm Heather moves north, it’s expected to bring gale force winds in addition to dropping drought-breaking snowfall.\n\nThe combination of winds and precipitation could spell disaster for those right on the East coast.\n\nFrom weather.com digital on-camera meteorologist Danielle Banks: \"Along the coast, there are a number of small-craft advisories that stretch from North Carolina up through Maine. The seas will be rockin’ from Winter Storm Heather, so be careful! Some coastal flooding could also be seen in the more vulnerable areas at the shoreline.\"\n\nFrigid temperatures from Winter Storm Heather are creating perfect conditions for ice in the southern U.S.\n\nAnd where there is ice, there is danger.\n\nFrom weather.com digital on-camera meteorologist Danielle Banks: \"I am not a fan of freezing rain. It’s very deceptive and hard to spot sometimes on things like concrete steps or say, the steps of your deck. Please be careful if you live up on a hill too.You’ll want to look at your driveway carefully before walking down. We don’t want people slipping on icy sidewalks either.\"\n\nAfter a day's delay and fans pitching in to shovel, Highmark Stadium was game ready for the wild-card playoff matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nCrews and volunteers worked in sub-freezing temps to clear most of the snow in time for the game, which was delayed from Sunday by a travel ban in the area.\n\nOrchard Park, where the Bills stadium is located, got 18 inches of snow from recent storms, with more expected this week.\n\nAt the time of kickoff, temperatures hovered around 17 degrees with chilly winds whipping up to 15 mph.\n\nTuesday morning commuters will be right in the thick of a massive band of extremely cold air crossing the U.S.\n\nAnd where school isn’t canceled, lots of kids will be in for brutal weather at the bus stop.\n\nFrom weather.com senior graphics meteorologist Dina Knightly: “Expect possible record low temperatures Tuesday morning as the kids head to school. Some places in Texas could be in the single digits and stay below freezing during the day. Give yourself extra time & make sure the kids are layered up and wearing hats, gloves and warm socks.”\n\nIn an area still reeling from Winter Storm Heather, a new system is set to bring more ice and heavy snow.\n\nT​he storm has been named Winter Storm Indigo by The Weather Channel.\n\nAn ice storm warning issued for the Portland, Oregon metro area officially puts more than 2 million people in the region under some kind of winter weather alert.\n\nForecasts show portions of the Interstate 5 corridor could see more than a half inch of ice accumulation. Hazardous travel, damage and power outages are expected throughout the day Tuesday.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe mayor of Shelby County, Tennessee has declared a state of emergency amid severe weather in the region.\n\nThe community has received several inches of snow, and extremely cold temperatures and wind chills are forecasted.\n\nThe mayor warned conditions could become dangerous if homes lose power and experience burst pipes. He also asked residents to stay off the streets if possible and check on neighbors.\n\nAn ice storm warning has been issued for parts of Oregon and Washington as dangerous winter weather continues to hammer the Northwest.\n\nThe National Weather Service is telling people to expect more power outages beginning Tuesday as ice and wind take down trees and power poles.\n\nNearly 100,000 residents are already without power following storms during the holiday weekend.\n\nOfficials say icy conditions could make travel extremely difficult, with potential impacts to both morning and evening commutes on Tuesday.\n\nT​exas set a new record for electricity demand today, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.\n\nE​RCOT said the peak demand came between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. and broke a record for January that was set just last night.\n\nI​t's also the most demand on the grid ever recorded during the winter months.\n\nThe previous record winter peak demand came during Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022, ERCOT said.\n\nMeanwhile, Texans are being asked to conserve agency for the second day in a row. ERCOT issued a \"conservation appeal\" for 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Tuesday local time, following a similar appeal today.\n\nERCOT came under scrutiny after extended power outages during days of bitterly cold winter weather in February 2021. Several deaths were connected to the lack of electricity.\n\nS​ince then, the agency has made several changes and upgrades.\n\n\"Tomorrow’s conservation appeal does not indicate ERCOT is experiencing emergency conditions at this time,\" a statement from the commission said. \"ERCOT will remain vigilant and communicate further if conditions change because of continued freezing temperatures and very high demand in the morning hours.\"\n\nD​ozens of school districts are canceling closes or moving to remote learning on Tuesday, expected to be a peak day for the extreme cold blanketing the South.\n\nLouisiana school closures include the parishes of East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, West Feliciana, Iberville and Pointe Coupee.\n\nM​ississippi counties closing schools include Covington, Forrest, Jones, Lawrence, Perry, Simpson, Smith, Wayne and West Jasper.\n\nC​losures in Alabama include Bessemer City Schools, Birmingham City Schools, Blount County, Cullman County, Fairfield City and Jefferson County. The University of Alabama at Birmingham will also be closed.\n\nG​rand Prairie, Texas\n\nF​lorence, Alabama\n\nT​hese are the airports with the most flights affected right now, according to FlightAware.com:\n\n-​Dallas-Fort Worth International, with 328 cancellations and 649 delays.\n\n-Denver International, 324 cancellations, 383 delays.\n\n-​Chicago O-Hare, 256 cancellations, 493 delays.\n\nP​olice in Grapevine, Texas, are on the scene of a pile-up involving at least eight vehicles, including a fire truck. One person has been transported to the hospital.\n\nT​he incident is on Texas State Highway 121.\n\nT​he fire truck was hit while responding to a previous wreck.\n\nThe wind chill is expected to be 5 degrees with gusts up to 25 mph by the 4:30 p.m. kickoff of the National Football League wild-card playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nT​he game, delayed from yesterday, is being played at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York. The stadium is in Erie County, just outside Buffalo, where a travel ban was in effect until this morning due to extreme winter weather.\n\nC​rews continued to work throughout today to clear the field and seats.\n\nFrom weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: With a predicted high of 0 today in Des Moines today and frigid weather across the state, the Iowa caucuses will be the coldest ever for voters in records going back more than five decades. Not only that, it blows the previous record out of the water.\n\nT​he next closest cold day was in 2004. The temperature that day? A balmy-by-comparison 16 degrees.\n\nC​lick here to read more about the history of weather on caucus day, plus see just how could it's expected to get.\n\nFrom Morning Brief newsletter editor Chris DeWeese: Frigid temperatures and winter weather have led to the cancellation or postponement of Martin Luther King Jr. Day events in multiple cities and towns across the country.\n\nIn Texas, San Antonio canceled a planned MLK Day march.\n\n“The cancellation comes as officials closely monitored the changing weather conditions, which have brought extreme cold temperatures and precipitation through the area,” officials wrote in a statement.\n\nHouston officials announced the postponement of two MLK Day parades due to a winter weather advisory.\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, meanwhile, officials canceled a planned march, but said that the indoor part of their event would go ahead as planned.\n\nFrom weather.com senior graphics meteorologist Dina Knightly: If you plan to be outside in the cold, remember to layer, layer, layer.\n\nYour first layer should be a moisture-wicking layer to keep any sweat away from your body. Avoid cotton. Your second layer should be for warmth and your outer layer needs to be a shell that can withstand the wind.\n\nKeep your head, feet and hands warm and go for the mittens, not the gloves. Your fingers stay warmer when they are together than they do in gloves.\n\nV​olunteers stepped up to provide emergency foster homes to 27 dogs after issues with a heater Sunday at the Metro Nashville Animal Care and Control’s impound area, according to The Tennessean.\n\nT​he shelter put out a plea for help as workers struggled to keep temperatures inside comfortable for the animals.\n\nM​ost of the dogs will likely return to the impound area once the weather passes.\n\n\"So if there's someone you know, or if you've been thinking about adopting, now's a good time to really come through,\" Henry said.\n\nT​he current temperature in Nashville is 14 degrees, with a wind chill of 3.\n\nThe Emergency Management Agency in C​olbert County, Alabama, is telling motorists that all roads and bridges should be considered impassable until further notice and all travel delayed, except for emergency vehicles. The county is located about 100 miles northwest of Birmingham and includes the cities of Muscle Shoals and Tuscumbia.\n\nA​ mix of snow and sleet was forecast across northern Alabama, and some spots could get between 3 and 8 inches of snow.\n\nFrom weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: We’re seeing ice all the way down to Corpus Christi, Texas. The heaviest has been on I-35 where it was kind of drizzling all night. That corridor of heaviest freezing rain is going to start shifting eastward next.\n\nUp toward the north and east, the bullseye so far has been in between Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, where some areas have seen up to 6 inches of snow.\n\nThrough the day today, we’ll see snow spread into Philadelphia, D.C. and Baltimore.\n\nBy tomorrow, it will be moving into New York City.\n\nAn icy section of Interstate 10 west of Houston is shut down in both directions. Local news reports say the lanes near Brookshire are blocked by an overturned truck and a separate crash.\n\nW​ind chill, or the \"feels like\" temperature, is a measure of how cold the air feels on your skin. Wind plays a role because it carries away the layer of warmer air that typically surrounds human skin.\n\nT​hat means the windier it is, the colder our bodies feel. For example, minus 5 degrees air temperature plus 20 mph winds results in a wind chill near minus 30 degrees, according to The National Weather Service. That means your body will react the same way it would if it was actually 30 degrees below zero outside.\n\nFrostbite can happen within 15 minutes once windchills hit minus 25.\n\nH​ypothermia, the biggest killer in winter weather, can happen even in temperatures between 30 and 50 degrees.\n\nF​ive people in a Portland, Oregon, apartment building were taken to a hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n\"This was a result of using both a generator indoors as well as cooking with propane indoors,\" a social media post from Portland Fire and Rescue said last night.\n\nThe incident is an important reminder about generator safety. Carbon monoxide is especially dangerous because it is colorless and odorless.\n\nTo stay safe:\n\n-Never use portable generators, gas grills or similar equipment indoors, in a garage or on a covered porch. They should be at least 20 feet away from any enclosed space.\n\n-​Always have carbon monoxide alarms in your home.\n\n-​Leave the building and call 911 immediately if you feel any symptoms.\n\nFrom weather.com writer Tim Harris: Overnight and into the early morning hours, parts of the south were hit hard by snow and ice. In Memphis, Beale Street was eerily quiet and covered in snow. And in Dallas-Fort Worth, de-icing was in full force at the airport. Here’s what it looked like around the South this morning as residents woke up to snow, ice and temperatures well below freezing.\n\nFrom weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: Winter Storm Heather is expected to bring 2-3 inches of snow to the Big Apple on Tuesday, which would break the city’s nearly two-year snowless streak.\n\nSo far this winter, several winter storms have tried to take aim at this streak after the 2022-2023 season didn’t deliver. The most recent, Winter Storm Ember only managed to drop 0.2” in the city along with heavy rain.\n\nCities from Washington to New York are all expected to get 2-3 inches of snow from Heather.\n\nVideo posted by local reporter Hope Winter shows crews working to remove heaps of snow from Highmark Stadium near Buffalo, New York, where tens of thousands of fans are slated to attend a National Football League playoff game this afternoon. Winter said that one fan told her around 200 people arrived close to midnight to help in the shoveling efforts.\n\nS​helters and warming centers are open, and C​hicago's cold weather emergency plan is in place through Wednesday.\n\nA​ full list of open facilities can be found here, and anyone in need of help should call 311 for assistance.\n\nFrom weather.com writer Tim Harris: Previously issued travel bans for Erie County have now been lifted with the exception of Lackawanna and the villages of Sloan and Depew. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said the ban for Sloan and Depew is expected to be lifted at 9:00 a.m. ET.\n\nE​rie County includes the city of Buffalo, which previously announced the travel ban there was lifted at 6 a.m.\n\nM​any schools and government offices across the country are already closed today for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.\n\nSome in Tennessee have also announced closures for tomorrow, according to The Tennesean. The closures so far include the following counties: Cheatham, Dickson, Lebanon, Robertson, Rutherford, Sumner and Wilson.\n\nR​ural Decatur County, located between Nashville and Memphis, had already announced schools there would be closed the entire week “due to the low temperatures as well as the lack of heat in some areas of the school system and the threat of bad weather.”\n\nH​oak's Lakeshore Restaurant in Hamburg, New York, looks just like something out of the movie \"Frozen,\" thanks to a combination of blowing water, wind and frigid temperatures.\n\nI​t's a common sight at the restaurant in the coldest months, and it's fascinating to see.\n\nA​t least four people are dead in Oregon, after freezing rain, snow and high winds over the weekend.\n\nA​ woman in her early 30s died Saturday afternoon in Portland when an RV caught fire after a tree fell on it. People inside were using an open-flame stove to keep warm, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMedical examiners were investigating two hypothermia deaths. At least one was in Portland, where hundreds of people took shelter at warming centers in the city\n\nJust south of the city in Lake Oswego, a man was killed when a large tree fell on a home during high winds Saturday.\n\nN​early 100,000 power outages are being reported across Oregon.\n\nT​he Tennessee Department of Transportation is asking people to avoid travel if at all possible. Photos and video shared to social media showed slippery conditions in several spots, including the Interstate 40 bridge across the Mississippi River at Memphis.\n\nY​ou can check Tennessee road conditions here.\n\nFrom weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: We typically talk about lake effect snow around the Great Lakes, but this morning it’s happening in Texas.\n\nThere are small bands of snow coming south off of Lewisville Lake and Eagle Mountain Lake across mainly the western half of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nLake effect snow happens when cold air flows over warmer water.\n\nThe Delta-T, or change in temperatures from the lakes to the air temps, is about 35 degrees this morning. The lakes are in the mid-40s, while air temperatures are hovering around 10 degrees in the metroplex. That’s just enough instability with just enough moisture left over to allow those snow bands to form.\n\nO​rchard Park, New York\n\nO'Hare International Airport, Chicago\n\nAbout 1,500 flights in the U.S. have already been canceled this morning according to airline tracker FlightAware.com.\n\nHundreds of others are delayed.
