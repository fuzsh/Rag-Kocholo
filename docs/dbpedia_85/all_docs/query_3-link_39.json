        "text": "This morning I awoke to some jaw-dropping snow totals in parts of the Great Lakes Region. The Weather Channel confirmed that Erie, Pennsylvania received over 53 inches of snowfall in the past 2 days (as of the time of writing) and more snow in a 30-hour period than any 13-day span since the 1890s. The National Weather Service in Cleveland tweeted that the Christmas Day total of 34 inches for Erie was a record and surpassed the previous record of 8.1 inches. It was also the largest 1-day snowfall on record for the region. The old mark was 20 inches. I realized that a basic meteorology \"101\" on lake effect snow was in order because it is a significant reason for these records.\n\nBefore I get into the meteorology, it is important to provide details of the Lake Effect Snow Warning in effect for parts of the region. The National Weather Service via the Ready.gov website stated on December 26th, 2017,\n\nLake effect snow is expected to continue through mid week. Lake effect bands will meander over the snowbelt counties producing periods of heavy snowfall with some areas receiving well over a foot of additional accumulation. As bitter cold settles in over the region, look for air temperatures to be in the single digits this morning and Wednesday morning, with wind chills falling below zero.....Additional snow accumulations of 8 to 16 inches are expected\n\nthrough this evening, heaviest from portions of Lake County east through northern Ashtabula and Erie County PA.\n\nOther parts of the area are expected to receive additional amounts also. The satellite loop at this link tweeted by University of Wisconsin-CIMMS is a breathtaking visual to prepare you for the discussion below.\n\nLake effect snow, from a meteorological perspective, is driven by basic physics concepts. The heat capacity of water is relatively large compared to other materials. This means that it takes water longer to cool down (or heat up) compared to its surrounding surfaces. This is why water may be relatively cold in June at the beach even though the sand is warm. It is also why the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is in September rather than June 1st. Lake effect snow, common in the late fall and early winter before lakes ice over, is describe by the National Weather Service website:\n\nLake Effect snow occurs when cold air, often originating from Canada, moves across the open waters of the Great Lakes. As the cold air passes over the unfrozen and relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes, warmth and moisture are transferred into the lowest portion of the atmosphere. The air rises, clouds form and grow into narrow band that produces 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more.\n\nThe NASA MODIS satellite image above shows how warm the Great Lakes were compared to the land surface last December. Wind direction, the geographical features of the body of water, and the surrounding land characteristics are also very important when forecasting location and amount of lake effects now.\n\nSince the lakes are not ice covered yet, the difference between colder lower atmosphere \"over\" the lake and the actual lake itself can lead to an unstable environment with rising air. Fetch is the distance that wind travels over the lake acquiring heat and moisture. When the wind exits the lake downwind, it encounters friction and slows down. This is called convergence. When the moisture-laden air converges, something interesting happens. NOAA's climate.gov website explains it this way,\n\nThe slower-moving air creates an atmospheric ramp. Faster-moving air over the lake (where friction is lower) overtakes the slower moving air over land and runs overtop of it, increasing the upward motion and leading to potentially heavier snowfall. It’s like sliding on ice on a sidewalk. The low friction means you can glide quickly. However, once the ice ends and the concrete begins, the high friction of the concrete stops your forward motion, and you go flying…gracefully of course. This procedure can cause significantly heavy bands of snow where snowfall amounts could reach multiple inches per hour, reducing visibility to near zero.\n\nA classic study published by Mark Hjelmfelt in 1990 identified four lake-effect snow types:\n\nBroad areal coverge. This type is common and typically consists of unorganized cumulus clouds in line (streets) or cellular patterns.\n\nShoreline bands. Lines of convection that take on the shape of the downwind shoreline.\n\nMidlake bands. Lower level convergence causes convection in the middle of the lake (Note the recent example below shared on Twitter by The Weather Channel's winter weather expert Tom Niziol. In this radar image, observe how the winds are from opposite direction on either side of the lake leading to a convergence zone over the lake.\n\nMesolow vortex. A counterclockwise (in the northern hemisphere) wind pattern forms over the lake. Meteorologist Reed Timmer tweeted an example of this on Christmas Eve over Lake Michigan.\n\nIn a year of weather extremes, these extraordinary lake effect snow totals fit right in."
