        "text": "As Monday enters the afternoon hours, the winter weather that largely steered clear of Summit County has shifted into the county's northern reaches. Although not as severe as the weather that closed many schools and slowed commutes along Lake Erie, it has wreaked havoc near Richfield.\n\nInterstate 77 and Route 8 showed a dusting of snow early Monday morning, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation. That dusting quickly turned into low-visibility and icy conditions at about 10 a.m. at I-77 and I-271 between Richfield and Peninsula, according to the Richfield Police Department and ODOT.\n\nThese conditions likely led to a 13-vehicle crash along the two highways that left an unknown number of people with non-life-threatening injuries, said Sgt. Bridget Matt of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, reporting preliminary information.\n\nMulti-vehicle crash: 13-vehicle crash closes I-77 north and I-271 north near Richfield amid winter weather\n\nNo preliminary snowfall reports for Summit County were available. Northern Portage County reported 4.5 inches near Hiram.\n\nThe most snowfall — 13.3 inches — was measured in Northeast Ohio and Northwest Pennsylvania near the borders of Geauga, Lake and Ashtabula counties, the National Weather Service reported Monday morning on X.\n\nTo prepare the roads in Ashtabula County for the snowfall, the Ohio Department of Transportation deployed nearly 20 plows as of 9 p.m. Monday night. As crews continue to clear the roads, ODOT reported on X that many of its plows are stuck in traffic.\n\nThe lake effect snow warning for the snowbelt counties remains in effect until Wednesday at noon, according to the NWS.\n\nForecast: Winter weather advisory issued for Summit, Portage counties for Tuesday morning\n\nAkron snow forecast\n\nA National Weather Service winter weather advisory remains in effect for Lorain, Summit, Portage and Trumbull counties until 7 p.m. Tuesday. One to four inches is expected in the region with more snowfall in the north.\n\nAlthough snow may be thin in Akron, temperatures will remain low Tuesday with a forecasted high of 28 degrees, according to the NWS.\n\nSchool closings in Akron, Ohio\n\nDespite the snowfall along Lake Erie, no schools are closed in Summit County, according to News 5 Cleveland, an Akron Beacon Journal news partner."
