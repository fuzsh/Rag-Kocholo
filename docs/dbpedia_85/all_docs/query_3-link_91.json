The heaviest snow will fall before Friday morning.\n\nA lake effect snow advisory is now in effect for Lake, Ashtabula, and Trumbull counties for the same period of the warning, through 4 a.m. Saturday, for lighter snowfall amounts.\n\n3 to 6 inches of snow is forecasted across the three counties.\n\nWind gusts up to 30 mph will cause dangerous driving conditions across the advised areas because of reduced visibility.\n\nThe Weather Service issued these winter weather statements because of cold air overspreading the Great Lakes tonight through Friday, which will produce the lake effect snow and squalls across the snow belt from Cleveland to Erie, Pennsylvania because of west-northwesterly winds. They outline the highest accumulations are expected south of I-90.\n\nThere is also a small craft advisory in effect for strong winds creating dangerous waves.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information on the lake effect snow watches and warnings, check out the National Weather Service in Cleveland's website.\n\nKeep checking cleveland.com/weather for daily weather updates for Northeast Ohio, and don't forget to submit any weather questions you may have!"
