        "text": "Winter is not over yet! We are waking up this Sunday morning to snow-covered roads and lawns in many communities (although not all) after an intense band of snow moved into NEO early this morning.\n\nThat band quickly dropped a couple of inches of snow and rapidly dropped visibility, too. The band has continued to move inland. A trough is swinging through the Great Lakes and bringing the snow today following a cold front on Saturday. Temperatures dropped 20 to 25 degrees in the last 24 hours. As this disturbance moves through the area, it brings scattered snow, and eventually, the lake effect machine gets flipped on. The highest accumulation is expected around Greater Cleveland. This is where several winter weather alerts are in effect.\n\nALERTS: The National Weather Service in Cleveland has upgraded Cuyahoga County to a Winter Storm Warning from a winter weather advisory overnight. Over 4 inches of snow will be possible, especially in eastern Cuyahoga County. There is also a winter storm warning in effect for Geauga County. 4 to 7 inches of snow will be possible there. Plan on slippery road conditions and travel could be very difficult. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Patchy-blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.\n\nThe NWS in Cleveland also issued winter weather advisories for Lorain, Portage, Lake, Ashtabula, Summit, Trumbull, and Medina Counties. Accumulating snow is expected here as well, but the totals look lower. 2 to 4 inches will be more common in the purple counties. All alerts expire at 10 pm.\n\nTIMING: Snow squalls will continue to be possible today. Plan for the heaviest snow during the morning and afternoon for NEO. Snow squalls or snow bursts are almost like a pop-up thunderstorm in the summer - not everyone sees the same conditions at the same time. These bursts of heavy snow could cause near-white-out conditions at times.\n\nPlan for rapidly changing conditions while driving today. Snow will begin to fade by this evening. Scroll through the images of Futurecast below to get an idea about the timing and coverage of snow on Sunday.\n\nTOTALS: Many communities did get a boost in their projected snowfall totals in the last day. Keep in mind these are ranges - always look at the low and the high number in the range.\n\nThe farther west and south you live from Cleveland, the less snow you will receive. For Canton, Wooster, Ashland, Mansfield, Norwalk, Sandusky and New Philly - you can plan for a dusting to 1 inch of snow.\n\nAs we move farther North and East, the numbers jump. So for Akron, Green, Barberton, Oberlin, Wellington, Lodi, and Alliance, you will likely see around 2 inches of snow. In NE Medina County, near Brunswick, over 2 inches of snow will be possible along with Elyria, Westlake, Mentor, Painesville and northern Ashtabula. 2 to 4 inches will also be possible in Cleveland, Strongsville, Bath, northern Summit County, Parma,, Jefferson and Twinsburg. The highest totals are expected in the primary snowbelt in eastern Cuyahoga County, Geauga County, southern Lake County, and northern Portage County. Over 4 inches of snow will be possible in this area with higher amounts near 7 inches.\n\nWant the latest Power of 5 weather team updates wherever you go?
