        "text": "Acting in tandem with the massive snow accumulation in New York over the weekend has been colder temperatures, with AccuWeather meteorologist Renee Duff saying the “coldest air yet this season” has dived into the Northeast for the end of the weekend. “High temperatures will be in the 20s and 30s F Sunday afternoon, with gusty winds keeping AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures in the teens and 20s,” Duff said. “Sunday night will be downright frigid, with lows in the teens and lower 20s.”\n\nAs of 9:30 a.m. EST, some New York locations in the vicinity of a Lake Ontario snow band are feeling the cold. AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperature in Syracuse was down to 18 F, with wind gusts of 22 mph. The RealFeel® in Rochester was 14, with wind gusts of 23 mph in the area. Rome took the brunt of the cold, as the RealFeel® dipped down to 8, thanks in part to wind gusts up to 30 mph. Duff also noted that milder air is on the way during the first half of the week, a fortunate sign for residents tired of middle of winter type conditions.\n\nAccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures in New York were down to single-digits in some cases Sunday morning, a preview of the cold to come for the remainder of the day.\n\nA blockbuster lake-effect snowfall has moved out of the Buffalo area as of Sunday morning, but extreme accumulations continue due to a heavy band streaming off of Lake Ontario. The snow band was producing snow at a rate of 2-4 inches per hour, and was becoming centered over Oswego County, just north of Syracuse, as of 8:46 a.m. EST. Travel was noted to be “nearly impossible” in the most intense portion of the band. “The worst conditions are expected to set up just north of Syracuse … with places such as Oswego and Rome expected to pick up an additional foot of snow or more into early Monday morning,” AccuWeather meteorologist Renee Duff said. Duff stated that back in western New York, which was pounded with snow between Thursday and Saturday, the biggest concerns going forward are blowing and drifting snow. Another concern is the weight of the feet of snow on the tops of roofs, as well as the extensive cleanup operations ahead.\n\nA band of heavy lake-effect snow continues to stream off of Lake Ontario in New York on Sunday morning, Nov. 20. (AccuWeather)\n\nAccuWeather National Reporter Jillian Angeline was on the ground in Orchard Park Saturday, a place that received over 6 feet of snow since the intense storm began on Thursday. Angeline stated that while hundreds of vehicles have been stranded because of the conditions, that number is still less than previous storms in the area. Officials have encouraged residents to remain careful and patient as crews continue to clear snow in Orchard Park and nearby Hamburg, which picked up more than 6 feet of accumulation. Residents took matters into their own hands with freeing themselves from snow in their driveways, including Orchard Park’s Dave Santana, who made sure to have enough gas in his snowblower.\n\n“When the snow started getting very heavy, I just had to keep up with it,” Santana said. “That was the only way, to keep ahead of it. But, it wasn’t that bad. My daughter loved it, she loved playing in the snow. It’s a lot of work, but it’s something we expected at least a week ago … we got ready for it.”\n\nIn Orchard Park, which received more than 6 feet of snow since Thursday, residents used whatever they could to free themselves of snow in their driveways.\n\nWith the majority of this week's heavy snowfall out of the way in the Buffalo area, and cleaning crews continuing to make a dent in the mess, Erie County lifted its travel ban for most of the county Sunday morning. After extending the ban to the entire city of Buffalo Saturday, the northern half of the city is now under a travel advisory, while the southern half still remains under the ban. Other locations still impacted by the travel ban are Lackawanna, Evans, Hamburg and Orchard Park, where the most extreme snow amounts topping 6 feet have been measured. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz noted that if travel bans remain in those communities on Monday, schools in that area will have to be closed.\n\nThe county’s Department of Public Works has reached most area roads in cleaning efforts, working on snow removal in southern parts of the county along the Lake Erie shore Saturday evening.\n\nAfter days of snow coated the Buffalo area with several feet of snow, the sun finally shined across the area, but digging out has only just begun and more snow is on the way. The dangerous winter storm has already caused multiple deaths. Hamburg Police Department told AccuWeather's Jillian Angeline that they're still rescuing stranded drivers and taking them to shelters as of Saturday afternoon. Several abandoned vehicles are blocking roadways and making things harder for plows to clear the area.\n\n\"We've asked people through social media and news outlets to not drive. They become victims trapped. We encourage everybody to stay home. Like I said, there's a travel ban in Hamburg,\" Tood Ehret of Hamburg Police Department told Angeline.\n\nSnow mobiles appeared to be one of the only ways to easily travel the area, but Angeline witnessed one get stuck in a snowdrift while turning around. The threat of more lake-effect snow will once again threaten Hamburg on Saturday night as AccuWeather forecasters say another 5 to 10 inches could fall into Sunday.\n\nBeing a Buffalo native, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has been through quite a few snow events, which is why she told AccuWeather Prime on Friday that she got a head start on this week’s storm by working with local officials and declaring a state of emergency in Erie County. “The reason we did it in advance of the storm is based on many years of experience … I knew that if we gave out the emergency declaration early, we start bringing in our assets,” Hochul said.\n\nPart of the asset-building was adding up to 400 plows to deal with the crisis both in Buffalo and throughout other impacted New York regions. Hochul noted that keeping people off the roads was key during the storm, and that residents shouldn’t leave the home even when seeing a slight lull in the snowfall. “Shutting down roads preemptively stopped us from having the situation you often see during storms, where there’s jack-knifed trucks that are blocking traffic and people become stranded, you get a real life-threatening situation,” Hochul said. “So we averted all that by being prepared early.”\n\nLake-effect snowstorm pummels Buffalo\n\nBuffalo, New York, is no stranger to lake-effect snow, and this current storm could give previous storms a run for their money. AccuWeather recently took a look back at some of the most historic lake-effect snowstorms in New York’s history.\n\n• The historic and deadly ‘Snowvember’ event dropped nearly 7 feet of snow across parts of western New York from Nov. 17, 2014 to Nov. 21. In Cowlesville, which is about 20 miles east of Buffalo, 88 inches of snow was measured. This was the highest snowfall amount produced by the storm.\n\n• An early December lake-effect snowstorm brought over 30 inches of snow to the Buffalo area in 2010 and the National Weather Service (NWS) said it was “one of the most intense and disruptive storms on record for the Buffalo area.”\n\n• In 2001, after a record-warm and nearly snowless November and December, a lake-effect storm impacted the Buffalo area just in time for the holidays. The storm went down in history as the biggest storm on record for Buffalo’s airport, as a storm total of 81.6 inches of snow was measured.\n\n• From Nov. 20-23, 2000, more than 2 feet of snow buried Buffalo. The metro area shut down as the storm delivered the city’s largest single-day snowfall for November on Nov. 20 when 24.9 inches fell, according to the NWS.\n\n2014 lake-effect snow event: Buffalo, New York\n\nFeet of lake-effect snow are forecast to pile up in parts of New York by the end of the weekend, but how is this different from a typical snowstorm? Widespread snow is often caused by a large-scale storm system like a nor’easter. Winter storms revolve around a central area of low pressure and can produce not just snow, but also sleet, freezing rain and thunderstorms. These far-reaching storms can spread accumulating snow over several states at the same time and can track across the entire country.\n\nLake-effect snow does not need a large-scale low-pressure system to develop. All it takes is for bitterly cold air to interact with comparatively warm water. When the wind direction aligns with the shape of the Great Lakes, it can generate smaller-scale snow events that can unload feet of powder over a small area. The localized nature of lake-effect snow means that a few miles could be the difference between accumulations of a few inches and a few feet.\n\nLake-effect snow is not just limited to the Great Lakes. Any large body of water can generate snow when the weather conditions are right, including the Finger Lakes in upstate New York, the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBy definition, snow squalls are intense yet brief periods of moderate to heavy snowfall accompanied by strong, gusty surface winds. Not part of a large-scale storm, snow squalls move in and out fairly quickly and typically last less than an hour. These fast-hitting, intense blasts of snow and powerful winds can pose a serious risk for motorists. In the matter of seconds, a blustery snow squall can create whiteout conditions and reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile. Each year, squalls engulf localized areas, triggering numerous and often deadly chain-reaction pileups on ice-laden highways across the country. According to weather experts, its often hard to prepare for the sudden onset of a snow squall while you’re driving, but understanding what to do if you are caught in one is crucial.\n\n1.) Try and exit the highway and pull onto a secondary road\n\n2.) If you cannot exit the highway, reduce your speed and make sure your headlights are on\n\n3.) Try and pull way off the highway or into a rest area and wait out the squall\n\n4.) Pulling off to the shoulder of the highway is not advised because oncoming traffic may not realize that you vehicle has stopped until its too late\n\n5.) Allow plenty of distance between you and the vehicle in front of you\n\n6.) Do not slam on the breaks. You could lose control of the your car on the slick roadways\n\n7.) Sign up for instant weather alerts that will warn of impending hazardous weather ahead. Due to the fast-hitting nature of squalls, special weather warnings that pop up on smartphones are critically important. That way if you are on the highway, you can possibly avoid dangerous driving conditions.\n\nSnow squalls are brief, yet intense bursts of snow and wind that are extremely dangerous to drivers.\n\nDue to the weather impacting the Buffalo region, the NFL announced Friday morning that the Buffalo Bills have canceled practice on Friday. “Due to travel difficulties, the Bills won’t have players make their way to the facility for Friday’s practice,” the NFL wrote in a statement. Instead, players and coaches will meet virtually on Friday. This comes after the NFL announced on Thursday that Sunday’s game between the Bills and the Cleveland Browns, which was scheduled to be played in Buffalo, would be played at Detroit’s Ford Field. The Bills plan to travel to Detroit on Saturday ahead of Sunday’s game. The team plans to travel back to Buffalo after Sunday’s game before returning to Detroit for a game on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the team shared photos of the snow blanketing the inside of Highmark Stadium, which is located just outside of Buffalo in Orchard Park. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), 36 inches of snow has fallen at Highmark Stadium.\n\nSnow has gotten off to an intense, quick start in western New York as a localized and intense stream of lake-effect moisture slides into the region. As is often the case with lake-effect snowstorms, just a few miles can mean the difference between seeing little snowfall or being buried in feet of heavy, wet snow. Already this morning, even though the snow has only been falling for a few hours in some places, many have recorded over a foot of accumulation so far.\n\nWhile much of the East Coast can see heavy snow during the winter months, little can compare to the intensity of lake-effect snow, and this week's storm is no exception. Already, snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches per hour have been common from downtown Buffalo southward. Conditions can also change almost instantly, as was the case at the National Weather Service office in the city. In the span of just one hour, the first 3 inches of snow quickly fell, with many more to follow.\n\nWith snow expected to remain in the area through the upcoming weekend, these extreme snowfall rates are what will allow for feet of snow to fall downwind of the Great Lakes.\n\nBuffalo, New York, Mayor Byron Brown warned Friday afternoon that while city resources are set up to clear the roads, residents should limit unnecessary travel potentially into Saturday. “Visibility will be very difficult and people need to be patient,” Brown told AccuWeather National Reporter Jillian Angeline. “This is not going to be your average Buffalo snow. This is going to be a heavy storm.” As many as 100 plow trucks will be on standby throughout the storm, and GPS on the vehicles will allow the public to track the plows and where they’ve been. Brown added that the city has been coordinating with the state, the county and Buffalo public schools, but while they feel prepared, he warned it won’t be a normal snow event for Buffalo. “This is heavier than the average snow that we get, so the public is going to have to understand that,” Brown said. “This is going to be a dangerous storm.”\n\nThe Buffalo Bills game scheduled for Sunday afternoon has been moved to Ford Field in Detroit due to an incoming historic snowstorm for the Buffalo area. The game was originally scheduled to take place on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. EST at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York. “Due to public safety concerns and out of an abundance of caution in light of the ongoing weather emergency in western New York, Sunday’s Cleveland Browns-Buffalo Bills game will be moved to Ford Field in Detroit at 1 p.m. EST,” the Buffalo Bills announced on its website on Thursday afternoon. The Bills will play two straight games in Detroit as they play the Lions on Thanksgiving. \"The decision to move the game from Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, NY was done in consultation with the Buffalo Bills and local and state authorities as the region prepares for the storm.\"\n\nThis is the first NFL game to be moved due to snow since a significant lake-effect snow event in 2014 moved a Jets vs Bills game to Ford Field in Detroit. In 2010, two games were moved due to snowfall including a Vikings game that was postponed due to snow collapsing the roof of the Metrodome. The other game to be moved in 2010 was an Eagles game that was postponed to Tuesday after the city of Philadelphia declared a snow emergency.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are slated to play the Cleveland Browns at their home stadium near Orchard Park, New York, on Sunday afternoon — the last day of the intense snowfall the area is forecast to receive.As of Wednesday, Orchard Park was under a lake effect snow warning set to expire at 1 a.m. Saturday, though warnings can easily be canceled or prolonged depending on how the weather conditions play out.\n\nShould the game take place as scheduled, there are a few things fans attending the game should keep in mind. Simply arriving at the game is the first challenge the weather will present. Lake effect flurries and squalls remain in the forecast for Sunday, making for difficult and even dangerous travel conditions. Once there, fans in the stands will want to make sure they’re bundled up properly. While Highmark Stadium has radiant heaters, temperatures around the open-air stadium will be around 31 degrees Fahrenheit. However, there will be an AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperature of 13 degrees. This won’t be the first time the team has had to deal with the weather phenomenon. Significant lake-effect snow in 2014 forced a Bills home game to be relocated to Ford Field in Detroit, a football stadium protected from snow by a dome.\n\nOn Thursday, Mary Kay Cabot, a Browns beat writer for Cleveland.com, reported that the NFL has been in contact with the Browns and Bills about possibly moving the game. A decision on the game’s location will likely have to be made by Friday, Cabot reported. On Thursday morning, Browns offensive lineman Joel Bitonio talked with local reporters about his dream of making a snow angel on the football field.\n\nThe flash of lightning followed by a rumble of thunder is synonymous with summertime storms, but when the conditions are perfect, the phenomenon can occur during bouts of intense snow. The ingredients for thundersnow will converge in the coming days as bands of heavy lake-effect snow develop downwind of the Great Lakes, including around Buffalo, New York, and Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nGenerating lightning during a thunderstorm and during a snowstorm are similar meteorological processes, but they come together more frequently during the warmer months. As ice crystals clash together in turbulent updrafts, charged particles are generated. When the charge builds up, the energy is released in a bolt of lightning accompanied by a clap of thunder. “Thunderstorms during the warm season have a much easier time developing strong updrafts because there is more warmth and moisture to feed on and more instability aloft,” AccuWeather meteorologist Jordan Root explained. The updraft in snow showers or snowstorms is not typically as strong as thunderstorms, but the updraft in lake-effect snow bands can be strong enough to create thunder and lightning. The result is a phenomenon called thundersnow, although the thunder may not be heard from far away as the snow naturally muffles sound.\n\nIn Oswego, New York, which is 30 miles northwest of Syracuse, there were multiple reports of thundersnow early Thursday morning as a heavy band of snow moved off the lake. Around 3:10 a.m., local time, Kaitlyn Jesmonth, a student at SUNY Oswego, posted a video of the thundersnow on her Twitter account. Throughout the morning on Thursday, additional thundersnow was observed in Oswego. Another video, taken from a live camera stationed in Oswego showed a flash of lightning shortly before 9:30 a.m. local time Thursday.\n\nLake-effect snow started to accumulate in areas downwind of the Great Lakes late Wednesday and into Thursday morning. Some of the highest totals were located just off Lake Erie, in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). About 19 miles southeast of Buffalo, in Colden, New York, 11.6 inches of snow accumulated in the past 24 hours. In the nearby town of Springville, New York, 11 inches of snow was measured as of Thursday morning.\n\nIn Ohio and Pennsylvania, snowfall totals surpassed the 1-foot mark. Located in far northwestern Pennsylvania, a weather station in the town of Springboro recorded 13.8 inches of snow. Another weather station, located in Cherry Hill, Pennsylvania, measured 12.4 inches of snow. Just west of the Ohio-Pennsylvania state line, in Edgewood, Ohio, 16.1 inches of snow had accumulated in the past 24 hours. As more snow is expected to fall through the end of the week and into the weekend, snowfall totals are expected to rise to the 3- to 6-foot mark.\n\nNearly 70% of the U.S. population lives in a region that receives more than 5 inches of snow annually, and an overwhelming number of the nation’s roadways traverse those snowy areas, according to the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). This means there is a high likelihood that your simple grocery store run or morning commute could be impacted by winter weather at least once. From snow to sleet to freezing rain or ice, winter weather yields numerous types of precipitation that all pose hazards and difficulties on the roadways.\n\nAccording to the FHA, more than 24% of weather-related vehicle crashes occur on snowy, slushy or icy pavement, and 15% happen during snowfall or sleet. But equally dangerous is getting stuck for hours in a snowstorm in your vehicle. Many people don’t envision themselves in this situation, but the unthinkable does happen and being prepared and knowing what to do can help save you and your family’s lives. “The best thing you can do to protect yourself is to not travel if you can,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said, but if you do have to be out on the roads, being prepared is vital.\n\n•Have an emergency car kit that includes a flashlight, gloves, a battery-powered radio, water, extra food and a blanket.\n\n•If you cannot move, stay where you are and don’t abandon your vehicle. It is a good place to take shelter, especially during a winter storm.\n\n•Notify the authorities with your cell phone and pinpoint your location with GPS either on your cellphone or with navigation services in your car. Make sure to tell the authorities relevant information, like how much gas your car has, how much food and water you have and your location.\n\n•If you don’t have any cellphone service to contact the authorities, then it is important to stay put.\n\n•Turning your car off periodically will help conserve precious gas and battery life and reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n•Make sure that your vehicle is visible to others. Using a piece of bright-colored fabric, road flares or a traffic light behind your vehicle will all help to ensure your car is easily spotted on the road or highway.\n\n•Make sure, if you have to leave your home, to have a fully charged cell phone as well as a portable cell phone charger for the car.\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) is preparing for what could be a historic snowstorm in Buffalo, New York, late this week and into the weekend. Officials say they have 200 plows ready to go, along with other machines known as loaders and graters. Erie County officials also add that their equipment has been mobilized as well. NYSDOT officials are urging people to make necessary preparations before the storm begins and to stay off the road once the snow starts.\n\n“Anytime we can remove traffic from the roads that just allows us to have a quicker and more efficient snow removal response. And in this day and age, many of us are able to telecommute, work from home. And this would be a perfect opportunity to do that,” Susan Surde, the regional public information officer at NYSDOT said to AccuWeather’s Jillian Angeline in an interview. Surde explained when there is less traffic on the highways, expressways and even local roads, it makes the response time after a storm much faster.\n\nOfficials are urging people to have enough food and water for the long duration event, and to stay off the roads once the storm starts.\n\nLake-effect snow is a weather phenomenon generated by cold air moving over comparatively warm water, so it’s common across the Great Lakes region during the late autumn as cold air from Canada moves over the unfrozen lakes. During this process, the combination of heat and moisture from the lake meeting the cold air cause clouds to form, which grow into narrow bands capable of producing heavy snowfall.\n\nMeteorologists look for a temperature difference of 23 degrees Fahrenheit or more between the lake water and the air about 5,000 feet above the surface of the lakes, with a greater temperature difference leading to heavier lake-effect snow. For this reason, the late fall and winter, or when the waters of the Great Lakes are still unfrozen and relatively warm compared to the colder air flowing in, is typically the prime time of the season for lake-effect snow. The winds are the main factor in where the snow falls, and in the cases where the wind direction doesn't shift, snowfall totals can begin to pile up."
