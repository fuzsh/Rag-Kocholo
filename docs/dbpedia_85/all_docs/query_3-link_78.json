Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan:\n\nLearn your community's warning signals.\n\nMeet with your family to create a plan. Pick 2 places to meet: a spot outside your home for an emergency such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case you cannot return home (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school). Choose an out-of-area friend as your family check-in contact for everyone to call if the family becomes separated.\n\nImplement your plan. Post emergency telephone numbers by the phones. Install safety features in your house such as smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. Inspect your home for potential hazards and correct them. Have your family learn basic safety and first aid measures. Make sure everyone knows how and when to call 9-1-1 or your local emergency medical services phone number. Have disaster supplies on hand.\n\nHome Emergency Supplies\n\nWinter has arrived and you should stockpile the following supplies in the event a winter storm or power outage prevents you from leaving your home.\n\nFlashlights and extra batteries\n\nBattery-operated radio and extra batteries\n\nEmergency non-perishable foods that do not require refrigeration\n\nNon-electric can opener\n\nBottled water\n\nOne week supply of essential medicines\n\nExtra blankets and sleeping bags\n\nFirst aid kit and manual\n\nFire extinguisher\n\nEmergency heating equipment, used properly\n\nWinterize Your Home\n\nTake the time now to get your home ready for the winter season by following these tips:\n\nHave your heating system checked by a professional annually. This will ensure that your system is working safely and efficiently which, in turn, will save you money. If you heat by wood, clean your fireplace or stove. Have your chimney flue checked for any buildup of creosote and then cleaned to lessen the risk of fire.\n\nMake sure your home is properly insulated. If necessary, insulate walls and attic. This will help you to conserve energy and reduce your homes power demands for heat.\n\nCaulk and weather-strip doors and windowsills to keep cold air out.\n\nInstall storm windows or cover windows with plastic from the inside. This will provide an extra layer of insulation, keeping more cold air out.\n\nInspect and flush your water heater.\n\nClean gutters. Leaves and other debris will hamper drainage.\n\nReplace batteries of smoke, heat and carbon monoxide detectors. If you did not do it when you set the clocks back, do it now.\n\nTo keep pipes from freezing:\n\nWrap pipes in insulation or layers of old newspapers\n\nCover the newspapers with plastic to keep out moisture\n\nLet faucets drip a little to avoid freezing\n\nKnow how to shut off water valves\n\nStaying Warm Indoors\n\nIf your heat goes out during a winter storm, you can keep warm by closing off rooms you do not need.\n\nUse only safe sources of alternative heat such as a fireplace, small well-vented wood or coal stove or portable space heaters. Always follow manufacturers instructions.\n\nDress in layers of lightweight clothing and wear a cap.\n\nEat well-balanced meals.\n\nLosing your heat when winters winds are howling is not pleasant. However, by following these simple tips, you will weather the storm more comfortably.\n\nProtecting Water Pipes\n\nTo prevent the mess and aggravation of frozen water pipes, protect your home, apartment or business by following the simple steps below.\n\nBefore Cold Weather\n\nLocate and insulate pipes most susceptible to freezing, typically those near outer walls, in crawl spaces or in the attic.\n\nWrap pipes with heat tape (UL approved).\n\nSeal any leaks that allow cold air inside where pipes are located.\n\nDisconnect garden hoses and shut off and drain water from pipes leading to outside faucets. This reduces the chance of freezing in the short span of pipe just inside the house.\n\nWhen It's Cold\n\nLet hot and cold water trickle at night from a faucet on an outside wall.\n\nOpen cabinet doors to allow more heat to get to uninsulated pipes under a sink or appliance near an outer wall.\n\nMake sure heat is left on and set no lower than 55 degrees.\n\nIf you plan to be away: (1) Have someone check your house daily to make sure the heat is still on to prevent freezing, or (2) drain and shut off the water system (except indoor sprinkler systems).\n\nIf Pipes Freeze\n\nMake sure you and your family knows how to shut off the water, in case pipes burst. Stopping the water flow minimize the damage to your home. Call a plumber and contact your insurance agent.\n\nNever try to thaw a pipe with an open flame or torch.\n\nAlways be careful of the potential for electric shock in and around standing water.\n\nIf The Lights Go Out\n\nIf you lose electrical service during the winter, follow these tips:\n\nCall your utility first to determine area repair schedules. Turn off or unplug lights and appliances to prevent a circuit overload when service is restored. Leave 1 light on to indicate power has been restored.\n\nTo help prevent freezing pipes, turn on faucets slightly. Running water will not freeze as quickly.\n\nProtect yourself from carbon monoxide poisoning:\n\nDO NOT operate generators indoors; the motor emits deadly carbon monoxide gas.\n\nDO NOT use charcoal to cook indoors. It, too, can cause a buildup of carbon monoxide gas.\n\nDO NOT use your gas oven to heat your home -- prolonged use of an open oven in a closed house can create carbon monoxide gas.\n\nMake sure fuel space heaters are used with proper ventilation.\n\nKeep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to help reduce food spoilage.\n\nGenerator Safety\n\nElectric generators can provide you with piece of mind and convenience when you are faced with a temporary loss of electric service.\n\nFollow these safety guidelines when operating a generator:\n\nBefore installing a generator, be sure to properly disconnect from your utility electrical service. If possible, have your generator installed by a qualified electrician.\n\nRun generators outside, downwind of structures. NEVER run a generator indoors. Deadly carbon monoxide gas from the generators exhaust can spread throughout enclosed spaces. Install a carbon monoxide detector.\n\nFuel spilled on a hot generator can cause an explosion. If your generator has a detachable fuel tank remove it before refilling. If this is not possible, shut off the generator and let it cool before refilling.\n\nDo not exceed the rated capacity of your generator. Most of the small, home-use portable generators produce from 350 to 12,000 watts of power. Overloading your generator can damage it, the appliances connected to it, and may cause a fire. Follow the manufacturers instructions.\n\nKeep children away from generators at all times.\n\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is a silent, deadly killer claiming about 1,000 lives each year in the United States. Such common items as automotive exhaust, home heating systems and obstructed chimneys can produce the colorless, odorless gas. The gas can also be produced by poorly vented generators, kerosene heaters, gas grills and other items used for cooking and heating when used improperly during the winter months.\n\nNEVER run generators indoors. Open a window slightly when using a kerosene heater.\n\nNEVER use charcoal to cook indoors.\n\nNEVER use a gas oven to heat your home.\n\nSymptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include sleepiness, headaches and dizziness. If you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning, ventilate the area and get to a hospital.\n\nFire Safety\n\nWood-burning stoves, fireplaces and heaters can add a cozy glow, but make sure you are using them safely.\n\nAlways keep a screen around an open flame.\n\nNever use gasoline to start your fireplace.\n\nNever burn charcoal indoors.\n\nDo not close the damper when ashes are hot.\n\nWhen using alternative heat sources such as a fireplace, wood stove, etc. always make sure you have proper ventilation. Keep curtains, towels and potholders away from hot surfaces.\n\nHave your chimney checked before the season for creosote buildup -- and then clean it.\n\nHave a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors ... and make sure they work! Establish a well-planned escape route with the entire family.\n\nKerosene Heaters\n\nThe use of portable kerosene heaters to supplement your regular heating is very dangerous and in most cases is illegal in New Rochelle.\n\nClearing Your Roof\n\nAs the snow and ice continues to build up, homeowners should think about safety before trying to clear the snow from their roof. Here are some safety tips:\n\nWhen possible, use long-handled snow rakes or poles.\n\nIf you must use a ladder, make certain that the base is securely anchored. Ask a friend, neighbor or adult family member to hold the ladder while you climb.\n\nKnow where the snow is going to fall before clearing the area.\n\nMake certain not to contact electrical wires.\n\nIf possible, do not attempt to clear the roof alone.\n\nIf you are afraid of heights or think the job is too big for you, HIRE HELP.\n\nClearing roofs is a dangerous task. However, if you think safety, and work safely, you will get the job done.\n\nNeighborhood Safety\n\nSafety First for Kids\n\nHey, kids! Winter can be a fun-filled time when enjoying outdoor activities such as skiing, skating and sledding. However, before going out, follow these safety tips:\n\nThe best way to stay safe in a snowstorm is to stay inside. Long periods of exposure to severe cold increase the risk of frostbite or hypothermia.\n\nIf you go out to play after the storm, dress in many layers of clothing and wear a hat and mittens. Many layers of thin clothing are warmer than a single layer of thick clothing. One of the best ways to stay warm is to wear a hat; most body heat is lost through the top of the head.\n\nCome inside often for warm-up breaks.\n\nIf you start to shiver a lot or get very tired, or if your nose, fingers, toes or earlobes start to feel numb of turn very pale, come inside right away and tell an adult. These are signs of hypothermia and frostbite. If you experience these symptoms, you will need immediate attention to prevent further risk.\n\nRemember these tips when you go out to play.\n\nNeighbors Helping Neighbors\n\nIf someone you know is elderly or dependent on life-sustaining or health-related equipment such as a ventilator, respirator or oxygen concentrator, you should make plans now to ensure their needs are met during severe winter weather and possible power outages.\n\nHelp them stock a home disaster kit including a flashlight and extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, bottled water, non-perishable foods, essential medicines, and extra blankets or sleeping bags.\n\nCheck on them after a storm or power outage. Register them as a special needs customer with their utility so they will become a priority customer. Notify others who could provide help such as neighbors, relatives, nearby friends and local emergency responders such as the fire department.\n\nHave a list of emergency numbers readily available.\n\nHave a standby generator or an alternative source of power available. Be aware of the safety rules for its use.\n\nProtecting Pets\n\nWinter is a time we should pay close attention to the safety of our pets. Here are some safety tips to follow:\n\nIngesting anti-freeze can be fatal for your dog or cat. It has a sweet taste and even a tiny amount can cause severe kidney damage and even death. If you spill some, soak it up immediately. (Clay kitty litter works well. Discard the litter once the anti-freeze has been absorbed.)\n\nPets that live outdoors should be fed a bit more in the winter because they need the extra calories to stay warm. They also should have fresh water put out a couple of times a day, or consider a special bowl that prevents the water from freezing.\n\nIf your pet goes outdoors, be aware of the temperature. Pets can get frostbite very easily on the ears, tail and paws.\n\nWhen walking your dog, check the paws to make sure that ice is not building up between the toes and that salt from the roads is not irritating the skin.\n\nIf your dog is a swimmer, keep it on a leash around open water or unstable ice. Hypothermia can set in quickly and the dog may be unable to get out of the water.\n\nBefore you start your car, you should honk the horn to make sure that a cat has not decided to nap in a warm spot under the hood of the vehicle.\n\nIf decorating for the holidays, keep ornaments out of the reach of your pets. Remember that poinsettias, holly, mistletoe and other plants can be toxic if ingested.\n\nRoad Safety\n\nWhen winter storms strike, do not drive unless necessary.\n\nIf you must travel, make sure you car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods and brightly-colored cloth to use as a distress flag.\n\nKeep your gas tank full to prevent gasoline freeze-up.\n\nIf you have a cell phone or 2-way radio available for your use, keep the battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling. If you should become stranded, you will be able to call for help, advising rescuers of your location.\n\nMake sure someone knows your travel plans.\n\nWinterize Your Vehicle\n\nPreparing your vehicle for the winter season now will help ensure your vehicle is in good working order when you need it most.\n\nHave a mechanic check the following items on your vehicle:\n\nBattery\n\nWipers and windshield washer fluid\n\nAntifreeze\n\nIgnition system\n\nThermostat\n\nLights\n\nExhaust system\n\nFlashing hazard lights\n\nHeater\n\nBrakes\n\nDefroster\n\nOil level\n\nInstall good winter tires. Make sure the tires have adequate tread. All-weather radials are usually adequate for most winter conditions. You may also want to carry a set of tire chains in your vehicle for heavy snow conditions.\n\nKeep a windshield scraper and small broom for ice and snow removal and maintain at least a half tank of gas throughout the winter season.\n\nFinally, plan long trips carefully. Listen to the local media report or call law enforcement agencies for the latest road conditions.\n\nDrive Safely\n\nThe leading cause of death and injuries during winter storms is transportation accidents.\n\nBefore getting behind the wheel this winter season, every driver could learn a lesson from our school bus drivers. It is elementary, but we have to keep our vehicles clear of ice and snow. Good vision is a key to good driving.\n\nPlan your stops and keep more distance between cars. Be extra alert. Remember, snowdrifts can hide smaller children. Moreover, always match your speed to the road and weather conditions.\n\nTrapped in a Car\n\nWhat would you do if a blizzard trapped you on the road?\n\nHere are some tips to follow:\n\nStay in your car and wait for help to find you.\n\nRun your engine for short periods of time to stay warm. Keep your down-wind window open and make sure your exhaust pipe is clear of snow.\n\nTurn on the dome light at night when you are running the engine to signal rescuers.\n\nHang a brightly colored piece of cloth or piece of clothing from your car.\n\nExercise from time to time by vigorously moving arms, legs, fingers and toes to keep blood circulating and to keep warm.\n\nOutdoor Safety\n\nDress for the Season\n\nWinter has arrived and you should dress for the season.\n\nWear loose, lightweight, warm clothing in several layers. Trapped air between the layers acts as an insulator. Layers can be removed to avoid perspiration and subsequent chill.\n\nOuter garments should be tightly woven, water repellent and hooded.\n\nAlways wear a hat or cap on your head since half of your body heat could be lost through an uncovered head.\n\nCover your mouth with a scarf to protect your lungs from extreme cold.\n\nMittens, snug at the wrist, are better than gloves because fingers maintain more warmth when they touch each other.\n\nPhysical Exertion\n\nWinter storm conditions and cold waves are the deadliest types of weather.\n\nCold temperatures put an extra strain on your heart. Heavy exertion, such as shoveling snow, clearing debris or pushing a car, increase the risk of a heart attack.\n\nTo avoid problems, remember these tips:\n\nStay warm, dress warm and SLOW DOWN when working outdoors.\n\nTake frequent rests to avoid over exertion.\n\nIf you feel chest pain -- STOP and seek help immediately.\n\nWinter Sports Safety\n\nNew York State offers an abundance of sports activities during the winter season. From skiing and snowboarding to ice climbing, hiking and other outdoor pursuits, parents and children should follow the safety rules of the sport.\n\nMost importantly, use the proper equipment and check to make sure everything is in proper working condition. A well-fitting ANSI/SNELL certified helmet will assure a safer, more enjoyable wintertime experience whether you are skiing, sledding, snowboarding or skating.\n\nDress in multiple, lightweight layers to stay warm and dry while enjoying the outdoors. Check the weather forecast but be prepared for anything.\n\nIf you are heading into the backcountry, never travel alone. Let someone know your route and estimated time of return.\n\nSkiers and snowboarders should go on runs that are appropriate for their ability. Stay in control at all times and be able to stop or avoid other people or objects. Obey all posted signs and warnings.\n\nNo matter what sport you participate in, always focus 100% of your attention on the activity and the terrain you are on. Moreover, rest when you are tired.\n\nSafe Sledding\n\nWinter is a fun time for children, but it also may be dangerous. Parents should be aware of some simple safety tips for their children when they go sledding or tobogganing:\n\nChildren should never use streets or roads for sledding unless they are blocked off from traffic.\n\nChildren should sled only during daytime hours.\n\nDo not sled on icy hills. Sledding hills should be only snow covered.\n\nAvoid sledding over snow bumps or anything that may cause the sled to become airborne.\n\nNever sled alone. An adult should always accompany small children.\n\nChildren should stay out of the paths of other sledders. In addition, if the slopes become busy, they should move off them quickly.\n\nParents, if you are sledding with your children, follow these rules yourselves.\n\nSafe Skating\n\nWinter is a fun time for children, but it also may be dangerous. Parents should be aware of some simple safety tips for their children when they go ice-skating:\n\nIf possible, skate at areas that have been approved and posted for ice-skating.\n\nNever skate alone. Always have at least 2 people present.\n\nChildren should never be allowed to skate on a pond unsupervised.\n\nRemember ice thickness is never consistent on lakes and ponds. Water currents, particularly around narrow spots, bridges, inlets and outlets are always suspect for thin ice.\n\nStay away from cracks, seams, pressure ridges, slushy areas and darker areas that signify thinner ice.\n\nNever skate after dark.\n\nHypothermia\n\nProlonged exposure to cold temperatures can cause hypothermia, especially in children and the elderly.\n\nWatch for these symptoms:\n\nInability to concentrate\n\nPoor coordination\n\nSlurred speech\n\nDrowsiness\n\nExhaustion\n\nUncontrollable shivering, followed by a sudden lack of shivering\n\nIf the persons body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit, get emergency medical assistance immediately! Remove wet clothing, wrap the victim in warm blankets and give warm, non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated liquids until help arrives.\n\nFrostbite\n\nPeople working or playing outdoors during the winter can develop frostbite and not even know it. There is no pain associated with the early stages of frostbite, so learn to watch for these danger signs:\n\nFirst, the skin may feel numb and become flushed. Then it turns white or grayish-yellow. Frostbitten skin feels cold to the touch.\n\nIf frostbite is suspected, move the victim to a warm area. Cover the affected area with something warm and dry. Never rub it!\n\nThen get to a doctor or hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nSnow Blower Safety\n\nDo you have a snow blower? Did you know that most snow blower injuries happen because the operator did not read the operating instructions?\n\nSo, read your owners manual and follow these tips:\n\nNever leave your snow blower running and unattended.\n\nMake sure the discharge chute is not aimed at passing motorists or pedestrians.\n\nNever put your hands into the discharge chute or augers to clear stuck snow and ice.\n\nNever add fuel when the engine is running and hot.\n\nMake sure you know how to turn the machine off quickly."
