        "text": "4.1 Validation of WRF Simulations\n\nTo evaluate the performance of WRF in simulating the winter storms and associated LES events, the following surface variables in the three selected winter snow events described previously are assessed: sea level pressure, 10-m wind, and 2-m temperature. The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) with a 32-km horizontal resolution is used for comparison. NARR assimilated a large amount of observational data from radiosondes, dropsondes, pibals, aircraft, satellite, and rain gauges. For all snow events (Figure 2), center locations of three selected surface cyclones from the WRF simulations (parent domain, 27 km) agree well with that from NARR. The intensity of sea level pressure is slightly overestimated in the WRF simulations, which was also found by Xiao et al. (2018) in their model downscaling experiments. The spatial pattern of 10-m wind and 2-m temperature from the WRF simulations also shows a good agreement with the reanalysis. By comparing the results between the VAR (Figures 2a, 2d, and 2g) and NON-VAR (Figures 2b, 2e, and 2h) experiments, we find that the LST variations do not have significant impact on the location and circulation of synoptic cyclones, which was anticipated because of much larger spatial scale of synoptic cyclones than that of the Great Lakes.\n\nThe simulated precipitation from the WRF parent domain (27 km) is verified against the 0.25° unified gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation from the Climate Prediction Center (Figure 3). The precipitation from the inner domain (3 km) is used for analyzing the impact of LST variation on LES in section 4.2. The uncertainties of precipitation during the storm events from the model and observations are both large, and the WRF model performs reasonably well in capturing large-scale patterns of the storm precipitations. To better assess the model performance skill, three statistic metrics for precipitation over the Great Lakes region are computed (Table 1). Both the VAR and NON-VAR simulations slightly overestimate the precipitation, with mean biases between 0.76 and 1.16 m/day. Results from the VAR experiment are moderately improved in terms of mean bias and root-mean-square error than that from NON-VAR experiment. The spatial pattern correlation (R) between model results and observations is similar from the VAR and NON-VAR experiments. Results from both experiments successfully capture the precipitation patterns for the three snow events (R > 0.6) over the Great Lakes region.\n\nStorm Mean bias (mm/day) RMS error (mm/day) Spatial pattern orrelation VAR NON-VAR VAR NON-VAR VAR NON-VAR 12 Dec 2016 0.97 0.98 2.08 2.09 0.62 0.62 12 Jan 2017 0.76 0.79 3.43 3.44 0.60 0.60 24 Jan 2017 0.98 1.16 3.20 3.30 0.74 0.74\n\n4.2 Impact of LST Variation on Lake Effect Precipitation\n\nFigure 4 compares the 72-hr accumulated precipitations from the VAR and NON-VAR experiments for three selected cases. For Case , LES occurs on the lee sides of lower Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario (Figures 4a and 4d). The most significant difference in precipitation between the two experiments (VAR vs. NON-VAR) for Case (Figure 4g) is observed in Lake Huron, where the area of strong precipitation (>20 mm) expands by 59.2% over Georgian Bay, and local precipitation increases by up to 34.5% along the east shore of the bay in the VAR experiment. Significant change in precipitation in Lake Erie between the two experiments also occurs over the lee side of the lake, stretching 100 km along the southeast coast, with precipitation increasing by 8–24%. For Lake Ontario, the increase in precipitation is confined within a relatively narrow area along the east coast, within a range of 8–30%. In contrast to the other three lakes, a moderate decrease in precipitation is shown in lower Lake Michigan in the VAR experiment compared to the NON-VAR experiment.\n\nStrong precipitation, associated with synoptic frontal activities, occurs over the majority of Great Lakes region in Case , centered along the east shoreline of Lake Huron and over Lake Erie. Significant changes in precipitation between the VAR and NON-VAR experiments are also shown over the Great Lakes region (Figure 4h). The precipitation on the lee side of Lake Michigan increases by 8–24%, and the influence of LST variation extends ~100 km inland to the east of Lake Michigan (Figure 4h). The increase in precipitation on the lee side of Lake Huron is slightly less, with a magnitude of <~8%. Alternating positive and negative bands of precipitation change occur over Lake Erie as well as ~200 km inland southeast of the lake. For Lake Superior, precipitation increases by ~2% over the water and decreases by ~8% over the land (Figure 4h).\n\nIn Case , large 72-hr accumulated precipitations (>20 mm) occur near Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario (Figures 4c and 4f). Increase in precipitation (~15–40%) in the VAR experiment is found over a large area of Lake Erie as well as over the inland east of the lake (Figure 4i). The precipitation on the lee side of Lake Huron also increases by ~16–30%.\n\nTo summarize the impact of LST variation on the location and intensity of the LES events, we calculate the meridional average of 72-hr precipitation in boxes A and B (boxes are shown in Figure 4a). Increases in meridionally averaged precipitation of 3–10% and 5–30% are observed on the lee sides of Lake Huron (Figures 5a–5c) and Lake Erie (Figures 5d–5f), respectively. Including LST, variation generally increases the precipitation on the lee side of Lake Michigan by 5–20% (Figures 5a–5c and 5e), except for the lower part of Lake Michigan in Case (Figure 5d). For Lake Ontario, increases in leeward precipitation of 5% are seen in Case (Figure 5a) and Case (Figure 5c). In Case , increase in precipitation of 5% is observed over Lake Ontario and a decrease in precipitation of 15% is observed on the lee side of the lake (Figure 5b).\n\nThe impact of LST variation on the areas receiving small (≥2.5 mm/day), medium (≥3.5 mm/day), and large (≥4 mm/day) amounts of winter-mean precipitation is presented in Figure 6. Winter-mean precipitation greater than the selected thresholds are marked in red (VAR) and blue (NON-VAR), respectively (red and blue areas that are overlapped are shown in purple). The regions receiving winter precipitation ≥2.5mm/day include the majority of the water bodies of Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario and a great extent of inland on the lee sides of these lakes. The only exception is Lake Michigan, over which winter-mean precipitation has not exceeded 2.5 mm/day, and precipitation ≥2.5 mm/day is only observed from the eastern lakeshore extending ~150 km to the inland on the lee side of the lake. The regions with winter precipitation ≥3.5 mm/day are much smaller, and the majority is confined on the lee sides of Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. A similar spatial pattern is shown for the regions with winter precipitation ≥4 mm/day, while the spatial extent of these regions is further reduced. The LST variation increases the leeward precipitation, most noticeably on the lee side of Lake Huron, where the land area receiving precipitation ≥4 mm/day has increased by 40%.\n\nThe impact of LST variation on frozen precipitation (snow) is investigated using the snow water equivalent (SWE) from WRF simulations. The area with the winter-mean SWE ≥140 kg m−2 from the VAR experiment (Figure 7a) matches well with the area receiving mean precipitation ≥4 mm/day (Figure 6c). Local SWE increases by >20% on the lee sides of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie (Figure 7b) in the VAR experiment. Increases in SWE on the lee side of Lake Superior are between 4% and 8%. Decreases in SWE greater than 10% are shown on the upwind sides of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie. This is summarized in Figure 8 with the changes in the meridionally averaged SWE in boxes A and B (shown in Figure 4), which shows a clear increase in SWE on the lee sides of the Great Lakes. The largest and the second changes occur on the lee sides of Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, with the maximum increase up to 9.34 kg/m2, and the impacted area extends up to ~150 km inland.\n\nIt should be noted that surface heat fluxes are certainly important factors of LES. In the design of the VAR and NON-VAR experiments, the lake-mean LST does not change between the two experiments at any given time over the simulation duration. This ensures that surface heat fluxes do not differ significantly between the two experiments, hence allows us to isolate and identify the LES variation induced only by the spatial variation of LST. Table 2 compares changes in the mean SWE and surface heat fluxes between the two experiments. Results show that the change in surface heat flux due to LST variation is not the major contributor to the increase in snowfall on the lee sides of the Great Lakes. The winter-mean SWE increases between 6% and 12% in the VAR experiment, while increase in the lake-wide SHF and LHF due to LST variations is much smaller. In Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, the increases in SHF and LHF flux are both ~1%. In Lake Erie, the increases of SHF and LHF flux are 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively. The percentage change in surface heat fluxes are relatively higher in Lake Ontario than in the other lakes, however still one order smaller compared to the change in the mean SWE.\n\nLake Mean SWE change Total SHF change Total LHF change Michigan +6.3% +0.8% +1.3% Huron +7.2% +0.9% +1.3% Erie +7.1% +0.1% +0.7% Ontario +12.6% +2.5% +3.3% Superior +3.2% +0.3% +0.4%\n\n5.1 Correlation Between Downwind LST Gradient and Surface Wind Convergence\n\nAbove results quantify the impacts of LST variations on LES events; underlying mechanisms are explored in this section (section 5). Initially, the correlation between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence is identified. First, two independent data sets (i.e., LST from GLSEA and surface wind from HRRR) are used to identify whether a realistic correlation between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence exists in the Great Lakes (Figures 9a and 9b and Figure 10, upper panels). Both data sets have similar, high spatial resolution (GLSEA LST [~1.3 km] and HRRR surface wind [~3 km]; notice HRRR includes 3 km radar assimilation) that resolves mesoscale features in the lake-atmosphere boundary layer. Second, we verify if the WRF simulations reproduce the correlation pattern and strength (Figures 9c and 9d and Figure 10, lower panels).\n\nThe downwind LST gradient, that is, the LST gradient along the direction of surface wind (Chelton et al., 2001; O'Neill, 2012; Schneider & Qiu, 2015), is mathematically defined as , where is the two-dimensional gradient operator with unit vectors and in the zonal and meridional directions, respectively, and is a unit vector in the direction of the surface wind. The downwind LST gradients are calculated using instantaneous wind at 3-hr interval. The mean values over winter are obtained by averaging 3-hr downwind LST gradients for DJF months.\n\nSimilar to SST and surface wind coupling at ocean SST frontal zones, positive correlation exists between the downwind LST gradient and the surface wind convergence in the Great Lakes (Figures 9 and 10). The LSTs derived from satellite observations as well as that from WRF simulations show consistent patterns of downwind LST gradients (Figures 9a and 9c) exist in coastal zones of the lakes. A strong negative downwind LST gradients zone appears near the east shore of Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario. The width of the negative LST gradient zones (<−1×10-5 K/m) expands ~50 km offshore from the eastern shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The downwind LST gradients over Lake Superior and Lake Erie are weaker compared to the other lakes. Wind convergence (Figures 9b and 9d, negative divergence) greater than 3×10−5 m/s is shown near the east and south shores of all five lakes. The highest pattern correlations between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence are seen in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. In the other three lakes, wind convergence zones (Figures 9b and 9d) generally cover larger areas than downwind LST gradient zones (Figures 9a and 9c). The correlation between the two can be seen more clearly in binned scatter plots (Figure 10). The increase in wind convergence corresponds linearly to the increase in the downwind LST gradient in all five lakes, that is, the stronger downwind LST gradient that exists, the stronger wind divergence/convergence coexists.\n\n5.2 Coupling of Downwind LST Gradient and Surface Wind Convergence\n\nIn open oceans, the well-organized linear pattern in Figure 10 indicates the coupling between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence, and the slope of the least squares fitting lines is often used to infer the sensitivity of surface wind convergence to the downwind LST gradient (Chelton et al., 2004; O'Neill et al., 2010; Putrasahan et al., 2013; Schneider & Qiu, 2015; Small et al., 2008). However, the same criteria cannot be directly applied to the Great Lakes. While a strong correlation has been identified between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence, it is inappropriate to draw a conclusion on the causal relationship between the two for the Great Lakes based only on their correlation. The correlation can be caused by the sensitivity of LST to nearshore shallow bathymetry (and therefore sensitive to atmospheric cooling) and coastal wind change due to the friction contrast between overwater and overland. Therefore, the coupling of downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence must be identified with further analysis.\n\nHere we quantify their coupling using the increase in the surface wind convergence from the NON-VAR to the VAR experiments in response to the inclusion of the downwind SST gradient. This allows us to isolate the surface wind convergence solely caused by downwind SST gradient from the convergence that can be induced by geometric features. Figure 11 presents the spatial patterns and statistical distributions of increase in the surface wind convergence induced by the downwind SST gradient. When LST variation is resolved in the WRF VAR experiment, surface convergence (i.e., negative divergence) increases by up to 2.0×10−5 m/s2 over the water bodies close to the lee side of each lake from that in the NON-VAR experiment (Figure 11a), and the most significant increase occurs over the eastern Lake Huron. Moreover, the statistical pattern in Figure 11b–11f also confirms the impact of downwind SST gradient on the surface wind convergence. Results clearly show that downwind SST gradients result in increases in surface wind convergence as shown in these well-organized linear trends. The slope, α, or coupling coefficient, indicates that the surface wind convergence is the most sensitive to the downwind SST gradient in Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie and the least sensitive to Lake Superior. The fact that large downwind LST gradient (section 5.1) and strong LST-wind coupling (section 5.2) exist in Lake Huron supports the results in section 4, which show that the most significant impact of LST variation on LES occurs on the lee side of Lake Huron. These are direct evidences for the causal relationship between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence, which reinforces the hypothesis on the dynamic linkage of the LST variation, surface wind convergence, and LES."
