        "text": "On the heels of the weekend lake effect snow that delayed the Buffalo Bills playoff game, parts of western New York are preparing for another blast of lake effect snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Buffalo has issued a lake effect snow warning for Genesee, Wyoming and Erie counties through 7 p.m. Thursday.\n\nHow much snow is expected to fall in western NY storm?\n\nBetween 1 and 3 feet of lake effect snow are expected to fall in the most persistent lake effect snow bands, with much of the area expected to see 1 to 2 feet of snow, according to the Weather Service. The pending lake effect snow is again expected to pummel the Buffalo area, where more than 2 feet of snow fell over the weekend in blustery conditions.\n\nWinter storm timeline: When to expect the heaviest snowfall\n\nThe heaviest snow is expected to fall on Wednesday - during the day and into the evening, said Weather Service Meteorologist Jim Mitchell. Wind gusts up to 40 mph are also expected on Wednesday afternoon and evening, which could create difficult travel conditions.\n\nWinter storm timeline: When will the heaviest lake effect snow hit and where?\n\nHow much snow will Rochester NY get in storm?\n\nMonroe County may see a few inches of snow from this lake effect snow band. Forecasters on Tuesday said they do not expect lake effect snow to reach too far inland to heavily impact Rochester and Monroe County.\n\nIt's possible that the western part of the Monroe County could see some lake effect snow from the band on Wednesday and bring snow accumulation, but it depends on how Tuesday's weather progresses, said Mitchell.\n\nWhat is lake effect snow?\n\nLake effect snow in places like Rochester and Buffalo develops when cold Arctic air passes over large, relatively mild lakes, creating narrow bands of clouds.\n\nThe unfrozen waters of the Great Lakes transfer warmth and moisture into the atmosphere, forming clouds that produce 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour. Wind direction plays a key role, causing heavy snowfall in specific areas.\n\nBuffalo receives more intense but less frequent bands of lake effect snow from Lake Erie, depositing up to 4 inches per hour, while Rochester experiences smaller but more frequent amounts lasting for days. These snow events typically occur in fall or early winter before the lakes freeze over.\n\nLake-effect snow records in western New York\n\nIn the lake effect parts of western New York state, for instance, Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester annually top the nation's list of snowiest big cities, each averaging more than 8 feet a year because of their proximity to lakes Erie and Ontario. The three cities vie each winter for the \"Golden Snowball,\" awarded to the region's snowiest city.\n\nNearly unimaginable snowfalls have occurred in New York thanks to lake effect snow: The tiny town of Montague, downwind from Lake Ontario, holds the \"unofficial\" world record 24-hour snowfall total of nearly 6Â½ feet, set on Jan. 11-12, 1997.\n\nAnd a crazy total of 5 inches of snow was once reported in just 20 minutes in Turin, Lewis County. Why crazy? Typically, a snow total of 2 to 3 inches an hour is considered \"heavy.\"\n\nHow cold will it be in Rochester NY?\n\n\"It will be very cold, far colder than what we've had so far this winter,\" Mitchell said.\n\nThe Weather Service predicted a high in the low 20s on Tuesday, upper teens on Wednesday, low to mid-20s on Thursday and Friday and mid-teens on Saturday. The lows will range between 10 and 18 degrees. The normal high in Rochester in mid-January is 33 and the normal low is 19, according to the Weather Service."
