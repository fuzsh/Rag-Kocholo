CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The lake effect snow watch for Geauga County has been upgraded to a warning by the National Weather Service in Cleveland, in effect from 6 p.m. this evening through 4 a.m. Saturday.

The warning states 6 to 12 inches of snow is possible for localized areas within the county, which will intensify this evening, and diminish sometime late Friday night. The heaviest snow will fall before Friday morning.

A lake effect snow advisory is now in effect for Lake, Ashtabula, and Trumbull counties for the same period of the warning, through 4 a.m. Saturday, for lighter snowfall amounts.

3 to 6 inches of snow is forecasted across the three counties.

Wind gusts up to 30 mph will cause dangerous driving conditions across the advised areas because of reduced visibility.

The Weather Service issued these winter weather statements because of cold air overspreading the Great Lakes tonight through Friday, which will produce the lake effect snow and squalls across the snow belt from Cleveland to Erie, Pennsylvania because of west-northwesterly winds. They outline the highest accumulations are expected south of I-90.

There is also a small craft advisory in effect for strong winds creating dangerous waves.
