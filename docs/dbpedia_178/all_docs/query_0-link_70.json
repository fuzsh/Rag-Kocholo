Rosalind Liverman Jopling\n\nIn August 1915 Watson Jopling with his wife Rosalind L. Jopling, and nine months old daughter, Dorothy, moved from Nashville, Arkansas, to Texarkana. The following year his father, Benjamin Lee Jopling, having retired from his farming and mercantile business in Garrison, Texas, joined the household. He became a part of the community, taking an active interest in the Fairview Methodist Church until his death June 10, 1929.\n\nUntil that time Watson Joplin had been a stockholder and employee of the Plunkett-Jarrell Grocery Company. In that year, 1929, he accepted the position of manager of the American Grocery Company, remaining in that position until 1931, when he organized his own company under the name Jopling-Sain. The firm grew and prospered at its original location, 223 Texas Avenue, until 1944 when he sold his interest to E. R. Sain and with his son-in-law formed Jopling-Eason Wholesale Grocer Company. They erected a building at 520 East Broad, where the business is now in operation.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Jopling have one child, Dorothy Jopling, born December 5, 1914, at Nashville, Arkansas. After graduating from Patty Hill School and Arkansas High School, she received her B. A. degree from the University of Arkansas in 1937. In that year, December 15, at the home of her parents, she married Thomas Rowe Eason of Fayetteville, Arkansas, born Dece.ber 15, 1912. They have one daughter, Carolyn Rosalind, born June 29,1941 – now a student at the University of Arkansas.\n\nThomas Rowe Eason is the son of Alcuin Pitt Eason and Emma Rowe Eason, pioneer residents of Fayetteville, his grandfather, John Thomas Eason, having established the Eason Insurance Company there in 1894 and serving for a time as mayor of that city. “Cap” Eason, as he was known, served in the Seventeenth Regiment, Mississippi Infantry, and was a staunch champion of the Confederate cause until his death May 20, 1918 – age 75 years. Emma Rowe Eason was the daughter of Emma Patton and Styles Taylor Rowe, a prominent lawyer and judge in Sebastian County, Arkansas. He was the son of Rev. Daniel Rowe and Margaret Ann Taylor, natives of Georgia. Daniel Rowe was the son of Joshua and Mary Rowe, and Margaret Taylor the daughter of Alexander B. Taylor and Mary ___. She was related to both Alexander H. Stevens and Zachary Taylor.\n\nWatson Jopling was born December 7, 1885, in Nacogdoches County, Texas, son of Benjamin Lee Jopling (b. Dec. 10, 1848, Tennessee) and Susan Long Fears (b. Dec. 31, 1849, Georgia). His paternal grandfather, Jesse Allen Jopling, was born July 23, 1822, North Caroline or Virginia [sic]. The married on July 12, 1846, in Tennessee, Laura Ann Dillen, a native of North Carolina (b. Sept. 24, 1829). Shortly afterward – 1850-1852 – the family moved back to Rusk County, Texas, and thence to Nacogdoches County, where they lived the remainder of their lives. Jesse Allen Jopling served with the Texas Lancers in the Civil War, dying October 8, 1874. His wife survived him until August 21, 1890. It was here, near Garrison, Texas, that Watson Jopling spent his boyhood – attending the Garrison and Nacogdoches schools until his work brought him to Arkansas.\n\nSusan Long Fears came to Nacogdoches County with her parents, Oliver Porter Fears and Sarah Ann Battle Long, from Troup County, Georgia about 1850. The Fears family was of English origin and early settlers of Virginia, owning land in York County before 1709. James Fears, father of Oliver Porter Fears, came to Georgia soon after the Revolution, with three brothers, all sons of William Fears and Ann Bulger (or Buhler). They were born in Virginia, February 16, 1746, and February 13, 1742, respectfully. William Fears served in the Revolution from Virginia. His plantation there is now the Prince Edward County State Forest.\n\nJames Fears married, in Georgia, Mary Anthony Porter, daughter of Oliver Porter and Margaret Watson. She was the daughter of Douglas Watson and Margaret Parks of Prince Edward County, Virginia. Oliver Porter, though quite young, served as Major in his brother William’s Company during the Revolution. His paternal grandmother was Mary Anthony, daughter of Joseph Anthony and Elizabeth Clark – first cousin to General George Rogers Clark and William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The Porters came to America in the person of John Porter from England in 1635. He served as a Virginia Burgess and married Mary Sidney, daughter of Col. John Sidney, of Norfolk, Virginia. Joseph Anthony’s father, Mark Anthony, was an immigrant from Holland to America.\n\nSarah Ann Long was a descendant of John and Elizabeth Battle, who came to Nansemond County, Virginia, in 1654 from Yorkshire, England – the same John and Elizabeth Battle from whom was descended Josiah W. Fort, who “erected on the south line of his headright a stout post, and on that post he nailed a board and on that board he painted the name which he originated for his dream city . . . . ‘Tex-Ark-ana’”. (The Battle Book by H. B. Battle, p. 65.)\n\nWatson Jopling and C. Rosalind Liverman were married in Keachie, Louisiana, July 20, 1910, at the home of her mother, Nancy Maria Hungerford Liverman, and the late Rev. George M. Liverman. As a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, George Liverman entered the Mississippi Conference December 1869. On December 2, 1872, he was transferred to the Louisiana Conference, where he served until superannuated in 1884, at which time he was elected President of the Fillmore Male and Female Academy at Keachie. He served as First Sergeant of Company E, Sixth Regiment of Mississippi Infantry, during the Civil War. He was actively engaged in the Battles of Shiloh, Corinth, Port Gibson, and the bombardment of Port Hudson. He was once wounded and twice captured – first at Alton, Illinois, and second at New Orleans – spending the remainder of the war as a prisoner on Ship Island. Jefferson County, Alabama, was his birthplace – December 29, 1838 – the youngest son of Jonathan Liverman (born 1786 in North Carolina) and Martha Boyd, daughter of James Boyd. He also served in the Revolution from Virginia – of Scotch Irish descent and born 1760 in Pennsylvania. In Blount County, Tennessee, 1797, he married Ann Miller. On May 8, 1798, in that county Martha Boyd and her twin sister Sarah Ann Boyd were born. He died January 14, 1853, in Newton County, Mississippi.\n\nOn her maternal side Rosalind Jopling was descended from Thomas Hungerford, who owned land in Hartford, Connecticut, as early as 1639 – “his home lot was on the west side of the road to the cow pasture – moved to New London about 1650 where he died 1663.” (Thomas Hungerford of New London, Connecticut, and Some of His Descendants with Their English Ancestors – E. P. Leach, p. 1).\n\nThe name is spelled as it is now as early as 1204 in England and is connected with Hingwar, a Danish chieftain who was drowned in attempting to cross a ford in Berkshire 870 A. D. and hence should be Hingwar-ford (P. E. Leach). “The first of the name of historical prominence was Sir Thomas Hungerford, who was register of Wyrie, Bishop of Salsbury, and is reported to have been the first speaker of the House of Commons 1377. Sir Thomas lived at Blark Bounton, County Oxford, and died 1398.” The ancestral home was Farleigh Castle. (E. P. Leach, p. iii).\n\nCharles Hungerford, born February 13, 1820, Harwinton, Connecticut, son of Anson Hungerford and Maria Baldwin, traveled to Georgia where he met and married, June 20, 1844, Lucy Ellington Hendrick, born Butts County, Georgia, March 8, 1827. Her parents were John Hendrick (born July 12, 1802, Wilkes County, Georgia) and Nancy Abernathy (born January 1, 1802, Lincoln County, North Carolina), daughter of Sterling and Mary Abernathy. They were married in Baldwin County, Georgia, June 29, 1820.\n\nRosalind L. Jopling was a graduate of the Louisiana Female College, receiving her Bachelor of Science Degree in June 1903, and Degree in Pianofort Playing, June 7, 1904. She has been for many years actively engaged in the work of the W. S. C. S. of the First Methodist Church, serving twice as its President, as well as the Texarkana chapters of the D. A. R., U. D. C., Colonial Garden Club, and Civic Music Association. She was born August 5, 1885, at Keachie, Louisiana. Mr. and Mrs. Jopling now reside at their home, 3103 Pine, Texarkana, Texas.\n\nThomas Fleming Kittrell, M. D.\n\nThomas Fleming Kittrell, M. D., was born at Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee in the year 1870. His father, George M. Kittrell, being one of the best known farmers in Maury County. Doctor Kittrell was educated in the public schools and the Academy at Franklin, Tennessee, and in 1894 was graduated from the Medical Department of Vanderbilt University. He came to Texarkana as a young man of twenty-five after serving his internship at Nashville City Hospital. He married Miss Eula Mae Thomas, daughter of Mrs. Louise Hannah Bates Thomas, who had come to Texarkana as a widow in 1894 from Shelby County, Tennessee. They had two sons, Thomas Fleming Kittrell, Jr., and James Bates Kittrell, M. D.\n\nIn 1900, Doctor Kittrell spent several months abroad and studied further at Middlesex and St. Thomas Hospital in London. It was in that year that he, in association with two other pioneer Texarkana physicians, Dr. S. A. Collom and Dr. G. G. Abell, established the Texarkana Hospital. Dr. R. H. T. Mann later became associated with them. Dr. Kittrell was the only surviving member of the original organizers of the hospital and was an honorary member of the board of directors at his death.\n\nDr. Kittrell served at one time as City Physician of Texarkana and was a member of the Miller County Medical Society, the Arkansas Medical Association and the American Medical Association. His success in surgery was marked by his acceptance as a fellow in the American College of Surgery. He also served as a medical nominator for the Provident Savings and Life Assurance Society of New York for a district embracing ten counties in Southwest Arkansas.\n\nThe “Annals of Arkansas,” published in 1947 about the prominent members of the medical profession says of Dr. Kittrell:\n\n“He has seen what is probably the most important transitory years in his profession. He has seen the country doctor with his faithful horse become the highly trained specialist. But he has not been a spectator, but has played an active role. He has not been denied the rewards that were justly due him.”\n\nDoctor Kittrell died at the age of 81, August 14, 1951.\n\nHewett – Hargett – Lumpkin\n\nMartha Walton Hewett, daughter of Travis Edwin Hewett, and Elsie Rowell Hewett, was born in Columbus, Ga., January 24, 1866. She was a descendent of George Walton, one of the signers of The Declaration of Independence, from Georgia, for whom she was named. Her father was in the Confederate Army for four years, at the close of which he lived with his family in Columbus, Georgia, until the spring of 1880, when he moved his family to Texas, in a covered wagon, and part of the way by boat, landing in Jefferson, Texas. Then they went on to Marshall, then to DeKalb, then to Texarkana, the latter part of 1880. She was married (2nd m.) to William Abner Hargett, November 22, 1893, in Texarkana, Texas, where she lived until her death, October 28, 1953.\n\nWilliam Abner Hargett was born in Obion County, west Tennessee, near Mason Hall, Tenn., January 24, 1861.

Postmaster of Garland, Arkansas since 1940.\n\nThe first record of the Lumpkin family of Georgia is Jacob Lumpkin. Col. Jacob Lumpkin is buried on the Mattapony River in St. James Parish, King and Queen County, Va. There is an old church built as early as 1690, known as the “Mattapony Church.” A marble slab lies near the north door of the church, which is inscribed with the death of Jacob Lumpkin Sept. 14, 1798, age 64. Tradition states that the stone which covers the grave was brought from England.\n\nThe public records of King and Queen County have been destroyed by fire in 1828 and 1864, however it is recorded that in 1690 Col. Jacob Lumpkin was granted land for importing 11 whites and three Negros.\n\nThe first family after Col. Jacob Lumpkin of whom there is authentic record consisted of three brothers, George, Joseph, and Anthony Lumpkin. There were grandchildren of Jacob [sic]; they were born about 1825 and lived in Pittsylvania County, Va. From all accounts Dr. Thomas Lumpkin was the intervening generation between Jacob and the three brothers.\n\nGeorge Lumpkin, the eldest of the three brothers, married Mary Cody, daughter of James and Sarah Womack Cody. (Tradition states that the Cody family is of Norman origin. From the family of Archeason, known among the Irish by the alias of McCody, which is a corruption of Mac-odo L’ Ercedekne of Archdenson, the first of the James Cody and Norman settlers in the country. James Cody and his wife, Sarah Womack, came from County Kilkenny, Ireland, to Virginia between 1735 and 1740; then to Georgia 1792, became a wealthy planter and died in 1795.\n\nAt least 30 land patents were issued in Virginia between 1623 and 1774 to various members of the Womack family. The land given earliest was to Richard Womack, 450 acres in Hennrico County [sic] 1672-37. The earliest grants were issued for the transportation of persons into Virginia, the later grants were sold outright. Also in 1691, 92, 98 patents were issued in Henrico County to Abraham Womack, Jr.)\n\nGeorge and Mary Cody had three sons, John, George and Robert, and one daughter, Mary. They left many descendants.\n\nJohn Lumpkin, the eldest of the three sons was born in Va. in 1763; married Lucy Hopson, and came to Oglesthorpe County, Ga. in 1784. (Lucy Hopson was the daughter of Capt. Henry Hopson and his wife Martha Neville – the later of the ancient Neville noble family. She was the daughter of Capt. Neville and wife, Lucy Thomas. Captain Neville (son of John Neville) was born in Isle of Wight County 1700 and died Goochland Co, 1752.)\n\nJohn and Mary (Hopson) Lumpkin had eleven children: William, Wilson, Jack, George, Henry Hopson, Samuel, Robert, Martha, Joseph, Henry, Thomas Jefferson and James Neville.\n\nWilliam settled on the James river, where he married and became the parents of a family of four sons, Joseph, Thomas, and Suirrelskin [sic], who became the progenitors of all the Lumpkins in this area and mentioned in this file.\n\nJoseph and Squirrelskin moved to Georgia, where they married and reared families whose descendents have held the highest offices in the land the gift of the people of that State – one becoming Governor, and other Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, both well remembered throughout the land. Robert remained in Virginia and his family’s history is little known to the writer. Thomas moved to South Carolina, where he married Miriam Ferguson, a daughter of the noted Tory Ferguson, who was captured at the battle of the Cowpeas by Gen. Marion. This couple were the grandparents of the subject of this particular part of the Lumpkin file.\n\nWe come next to the descendents of Richard Euell Lumpkin, born at Savannah, Ga., Feb. 22, 1819; married in 1954 [sic], Jane Cornelius Elliott born 1821, daughter of Richard McDowell Johnson Elliott, born St. Mary, Ga., July 23, 1787; (Alcade of the Republic of Texas); died 1856, married Dec. 25, 1801, Jane McCullough Chisholm born Feb. 26, 1781, died 1856, daughter of Capt. David McCullough born Ireland July 2, 1738, died Savannah, Ga. in 1795; married Dec. 25, 1765 to Phoebe Boyd, born Philadelphia, Pa., Jan. 10, 1746.\n\n(Captain David McCullough commanded a private owned ship named “Rattle Snake.” A commission of Marque and Reprisals for his ship was obtained from Congress and he put to sea immediately with his ship mounted with 20 guns. He cleared the Southern Coast and Gulf Stream of the enemies vessels; served his country well and was so honored.)\n\nThis brings us down to William Hays Lumpkin, son of the above Richard Euell Lumpkin, born in Jefferson, Texas July 3, 1855; marrier [sic] January 2, 1880 to Mary Jane McMickle, born Jackson, Miss., June 28, 1862. Lived in Texarkana, Texas for many years, reared eleven children born of this marriage and three foster children. The old home place is now a popular residential area being reached from Fish-Ghio Blvd. straight through to the Summerhill and Richmond Roads.\n\nEveret Powell Lumpkin, their son, born Sand Springs, Texas April 28, 1881, died Texarkana, Texas Feb. 27, 1957; married Sept. 2, 1907 to Lela Belle Casey, born Texarkana, Texas July 23, 1891. Moved to Texarkana as a small child with his parents and lived to see it become a city of fifty thousand people. He lived in Texarkana all his life, was a contractor and real estate dealer. Helped to develop Beverly Heights and has one street, Lumpkin Street, named in his honor. He lived for over thirty years in his place, 2617 Fish-Ghio Boulevard, Texarkana, Texas. Was a member of the First Baptist Church, Third and Pine, Texarkana, Texas for forty years. His wife, the former Lela Belle Casey, lives now in the old home at the writing of this file.\n\n“He who takes no pride in his ancestry\n\nwill not leave behind much of which his\n\nposterity may be proud.”\n\nThis file prepared by Doris Lumpkin Crank May 17,1960.\n\nColonel Woodford Haywood Mabry\n\nColonel Woodford Haywood Mabry was born at Jefferson, Texas, September 3, 1856. He was the son of General H. P. Mabry and Mrs. Sarah Haywood Mabry. The father was a Brigadier General in the Civil War, afterwards practicing law and holding the office of District Judge at Jefferson.\n\nColonel Mabry received his early educational training at Jefferson. At the age of sixteen he was sent to the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington, Virginia, and, after four years of study, he was, in 1875, graduated with the rank of captain, the youngest in a class of forty-three members, and one of five who took distinguished honors. He was offered a sub-professorship in mathematics at V.M.I., but declined it and engaged in civil engineering work for the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, assisting in laying out the right of way of that railroad through the western portion of Texas to New Mexico. Indians repeatedly threatened battle during this expedition and three times everything was made ready for fighting.\n\nAfter eight years in business in Jefferson and Ft. Worth, he was, in 1887 by Governor L. D. Ross appointed a colonel on the Adjutant General’s Staff and in 1891 received from Governor James S. Hogg appointment as Adjutant General of Texas, being later in 1895 re-appointed to this position by Governor Chas. A. Culberson, his boyhood friend and his classmate at the Virginia Military Institute.\n\nThe eight year period of Colonel Mabry’s occupancy of the Adjutant Generalship marked the peak of activity of the then important Texas State Militia. Colonel Mabry commanded these troops, and, for their better accommodation and training, selected the site for, established and improved Camp Mabry on a tract of 200 acres, where the State Encampments were thereafter held. Camp Mabry was also used by the United States during the World War as a ground school for aviation.\n\nWhen in 1898 war with Spain was declared, Colonel Mabry at once tendered his services and was given the position of Colonel of the First Texas Volunteer Infantry, Wheaton’s Brigade, Keifer’s ivision [sic], Seventh Army Corps, commanded by Major General Fitzhugh Lee. This was the Senior Texas Regiment.\n\nAt the head of his Regiment he was in the preparatory Camps of Mobile, Miami, Jacksonville, and Savannah, and, upon General Wheaton’s transfer, became Acting Brigadier General, serving at all of these camps.\n\nHe died at Camp Columbia, near Havana, on January 4, 1899. Funeral services were held in Havana, after which his body was sent to the United States and returned under escort to Jefferson, Texas, where he was interred in Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nLucie Mabel Allen was born August 11, 1861 in Jefferson, Texas. Her parents were Augustus C. Allen and his wife, Ellen Virginia Adams. She spent her childhood in Jefferson. In her early teens she attended, for a time, a small girls’ school in Marshall, Texas. At the age of sixteen, she married Woodford Haywood Mabry. They lived in Jefferson, Ft. Worth, and Austin, Texas. The couple had a large family of one boy and six daughters. They are: Allen Mabry, Abigail Mabry Wisdom, Nell Mabry Van Dyne, Jessie Mabry Briley, Lucie Mabry Cleveland, Haywood Mabry Bayless (deceased), and Dorothy Mabry Fitzpatrick.\n\nIn 1899, Mrs. Mabry was left a widow by the death of her husband during the Spanish American War. She moved to Texarkana with her children to be near her parents, who had moved here from Jefferson in 1886. The home which she purchased at 616 Pine Street was a gathering place for young people for many years, as six daughters grew to womanhood.\n\nMrs. Mabry became a member of the Lone Star Chapter of D. A. R. December 6, 1910.\n\nMrs. Mabry traveled a great deal in her later years, but Texarkana remained her home until her death in 1945.\n\nDescent of Sarah Abigail Haywood\n\nCompiled by Marshall DeLancey Haywood\n\nof Raleigh, North Carolina, January 14, 1915\n\nSarah Abigail Haywood, daughter of William Henry Haywood, of Marion County, Texas and Eliza Jones, his wife;\n\nThe said William Henry Haywood was the son of William Haywood of Franklin County, North Carolina, and Abigail Jones, his wife;\n\nThe said William Haywood was the son Major Egbert Haywood of Halifas [sic] County, N.

Mr. Martin came as an official of the Railway Mail Service, with offices in the Post Office building.\n\nMrs. Martin, a woman of great charm and talent, soon made many friends and became active in several organizations. They joined the First Methodist Church (Arkansas) and took active part in all services. Mr. Martin served on the Board of Stewards for twenty-five years and was Superintendent of the Sunday School for sixteen years. He also served as Church Treasurer for many, many years. Mrs. Martin was contralto soloist in the choir. Her musical talent led her into many activities in the Wednesday Music Club. She served as President and in other capacities. Her activities in the United Daughters of the Confederacy and in the Daughters of the American Revolution led her into state offices in both organizations.\n\nMrs. Martin’s most outstanding achievement was as Founder of the Arkansas Branch of the Huguenot Society of the Founders of Manakintowne in Virginia. (This was in 1937 at the Grim Hotel in Texarkana). Her National number is 218.\n\nMrs. Martin’s Wainwright Ancestry traces back through an illustrious line of Methodist ministers. Her uncle, Dr. Samuel H. Wainwright, was a medical missionary in Japan for fifty years.\n\nThe immigrant, Thomas Wainwright (born in England 1620; died Sept. 15, 1683, in New Jersey), came to Massachusetts in 1639, where his son Thomas was born Jan. 15, 1648.

Y., and died in Batavia, Ohio. He (Daniel) married Hannah (or Elizabeth) Stricklan, and their son was the Rev. Daniel Thomas Wainright, who married Amanda Fitzallen Agee. Her Huguenot ancestor is Mathew Agee, who came to Manikan Town, Virginia, on one of the early ships. (National Huguenot No. 218).

He is attending Rice University and is an honor student.\n\nThe Mathews Family\n\nI, William Harry Mathews, Jr., was born in Texarkana, Texas, on August 28, 1903. My father, William H. Mathews, Sr., was born near Jefferson, Texas on Sept. 21, 1871, and shortly thereafter the family moved to Queen City, Cass County, Texas, where my grandfather was a merchant and leading citizen of the community. My father was educated in the public schools of Queen City, and after a varied career as a “printer’s devil,” printer, editor, telephone lineman, professional photographer, and manufacturer of corn salve, he came to Texarkana in 1896 and took the examination for post-office carrier. He was among the five men who were selected from the 44 who passed the examination, to be the first letter carriers when postal delivery service was started in Texarkana on April 15, 1896.\n\nOn December 1, 1897, he was married to Ida Evelyn Earp of Linden, Texas, whom he had met when taking her picture during his photographic career. To this union were born Thelma, an infant daughter who died when several weeks old, and myself. After spending a total of more than thirty-eight years in the postal service, my father was retired in 1934 and passed away in 1953 at the age of 81, to be followed in death by my mother at the age of 83, in 1958.\n\nI was married on December 31, 1927, to Hildred Jahren Sellers, whose home was Dallas, Texas. To this union was born one son, William H. Mathews, III, on January 16, 1931. He is a career man in the United States Navy, having now served more than ten years and is now a petty officer first class. He married Naomi Register of Miami, Florida, and they have two children: Amy Carol, born June 18, 1955, and Blake Kent, born November 13, 1958, both born in Millington, Tennessee.\n\nI am supervisor in the Postal Transportation Service, in the terminal located at Texarkana, where I have been for 18 years.\n\nOn my father’s side, our lineage can be traced as far back as 1751, when Marty G. Mathews who served in the Revolutionary War, was born. His son was Josiah Mathews, born Nov. 15, 1785. His son was Joseph Pinckney Mathews, born in Alabama Nov. 22, 1817. His son was William Franklin Mathews, my grandfather, born in Talbot County, Georgia, Sept. 4, 1840. His son was William H. Mathews, Sr., born Sept. 21, 1871 in Marion County, Texas. Myself, William H. Mathews, Jr., was born Aug. 28, 1903, in Texarkana, Texas.\n\nOn my mother’s side (Earps), the lineage has been traced back only as far as Caleb Asbury Earp, my great grandfather. He was born in Anderson, South Carolina, in 1816. When a young married man, he joined a wagon train to Texas, and upon arrival at what is now the town of Jefferson, Texas, he built the first house there near where the highway bridge over the Cypress river is now located. His son was Caleb Alonzo Earp, born in Linden, Texas, in 1854. Caleb Alonzo Earp, my grandfather, was a second cousin of Wyatt Earp, the frontier marshal. He became a carpenter and contractor, and many of the pioneer homes of Cass and Marion counties were built by him. His daughter was Ida Evelyn Earp, my mother, who was born June 5, 1875, at Lanier, near Linden, Texas.\n\nMy earliest recollections of Texarkana naturally were of our home. My father bought 1½ lots at the corner of 13th and Wood Streets, and built a small frame house there. In 1912, the one story house was made into a two-story dwelling, and still stands at the same location at this time. At the time the house was built and for some years thereafter, the house was practically out in the country, being surrounded by open fields and pine woods. As late as 1910 when I started going to the Highland Park school, there were only three or four houses between our home at 13th and Wood and the school at 24th and Wood. Some of my earliest recollections were of trudging reluctantly down the sandy road which was Wood Street at that time, on my way to school. My return from school in the afternoons was usually made by wading up the small branch which ran from the school to within a block of my home, stopping frequently to fish for “craw-dads” with a piece of string and bits of meat saved from my lunch.\n\nOne of the main attractions of the horse and buggy days of my childhood was Spring Lake Park, which was owned at that time by the electric company, which did a thriving business during summer, spring and fall hauling families to the park on the street car line. A visit to the park was eagerly looked forward to by all, both adults as well as children. The street cars were open faced, not closed in, with benches facing sideways and a running board upon which those riders who could not obtain seats, rode standing up. The park was quite an establishment in those days, having boating, swimming, dance hall, skating rink, refreshment stands, picture show, zoo, and race track, as well as picnic grounds and tables. The first airplane to come to Texarkana landed in the center of the race track, a canvas fence was erected, and admission was charged to see the “flying machine.” A little later, a plane made a crash landing in Braumiller’s fields where Sussex Downs now is and Texarkanians had the opportunity of inspecting the wreck for free.\n\nA visit to the fire station was excitement for a young boy, especially if an alarm happened to come in at the time. The horses were stabled in stalls with their harness suspended above them so it could be dropped on them and buckled on in a minute or so. Meantime another fireman would be lighting the kindling beneath the boiler of the old steam pumper. Then, with a great clanging of bells and spouting great clouds of black smoke, the pumper would be off to the scene of the fire.\n\nThe automobile age began coming to Texarkana about 1909. The first two autos that I can remember belonged to Dr. W. K. Reed and to a real estate man named Hancock. They were very similar, both being bright red and with high buggy wheels and solid rubber tires. In 1914 my father bought our first Model T Ford from R. E. Dove at the Texas Motor Co., located where the P & M building now is. Shortly thereafter we made a trip to Sherman, Texas. With the state of the roads which served for highways at the time, and the unreliability of operation of automobiles, this was quite an achievement – so much so, that headlines appeared in “The Daily Texarkanian:” “Local Family Makes Trip by Auto to Sherman in TWO Days – No Accidents Reported.”\n\nTexarkana has been my home for 56 years, except for a year spent in Paris, Texas, and a short time in Baton Rouge, La., and I expect to continue to make it my home because “there is no place like it.”\n\nWilliam Henry Mathews, Jr.\n\nWilliam A. McCartney, Sr.\n\nWilliam A. McCartney, Sr., was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 12, 1870, the son of William H. and Anna McCartney. He came to Texarkana with his parents July 4, 1874, at the age of four years. After attending the local schools he attended Western Military Academy of Alton, Illinois, Pennsylvania Military Academy at Chester, Pennsylvania, and Rose Polytechnic Institute at Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nAfter completing his education he joined his father in the management of the Cosmopolitan Hotel which was located on one of the first lots purchased in Texarkana after completion of the old St. Louis Iron Mountain Railroad into this City.\n\nDuring the early days he became acquainted with a good many people of the stage playing in road shows in Texarkana. This interest in things theatrical lasted throughout his lifetime. In the late 20’s and 30’s he was instrumental in bringing to Texarkana nationally known attractions, such as Will Rogers, Galli-Curci, and many others. Also he staged and presented The Follies much to the enjoyment of Texarkanians who delighted in amateur theatricals.\n\nHe took a very early interest in good roads around Texarkana starting at a time when Texarkana was rather handicapped without any good roads and without any bridges across Red River and Sulphur River. These river barriers more or less circled the town within fifty miles of Texarkana, the road to Paris being the only route not requiring a bridge. Perhaps the growth of Texarkana may be dated from 1925-30 period when three ten mile stretches of concrete roads radiated from the City as well as good bridges. As a result of his interest in co-operation with the late State Senator Bob Hubbard a bridge located on Highway 59 just East of the new Texarkana Dam is named for him.\n\nMr. McCartney served on the School Board in the early 1900’s.\n\nMr. McCartney throughout his life kept in touch with his old and new friends and remained in touch with a good number of our leaders in Washington resulting in a number of benefits for the growth of Texarkana.\n\nHe was President of the Hotel McCartney and was one of the founders of the Arkansas Hotel Men’s Association.\n\nHe passed away in April 1952 at the age of 81.\n\nIn the McCartney Family two children, Mrs. Katherine McCartney Hibbitts and W. A. McCartney, Jr., were born in Texarkana and are still residents.\n\nGeorge Clinton McCoppin\n\nGeorge Clinton McCoppin was born in Ireland March 13, 1820 and with two older brothers came to America in the year 1835, when 15 years of age. He died January 18, 1878. The McCoppin brothers landed in New York and in a few years became separated, with George Clinton making his way to Mississippi where he married Rebecca A. Washington in 1848. Rebecca A. Washington was born June 25, 1826 and died November 5, 1905. She was born in Virginia but came to Mississippi at an early age. Both of these pioneers are buried in Sand Hill Cemetery near Simms, Texas, along with numerous other members of the family.\n\nIn 1859 George Clinton McCoppin and his wife and young family came to Texarkana, Texas from Mississippi, and in a very short time settled near Simms, Texas, where they obtained a grant of 160 acres of land known as the G. C. McCoppin Survey; they acquired an additional 340 acres known as the T. Y. Logwood Survey; 160 acres known as the John Barkman Survey; and 115½ acres out of the John Weaver Survey. The first home was built with logs and contained no nails or hardware. There were no windows and only a front and back door with front porch. The records in the General Land Office at Austin, Texas shows the above named tracts of land were granted to G. C. McCoppin and the estate now contains 747 acres (less 10 acres sold to Stone family). The old home and acreage now belongs to the heirs of Sally E. McCoppin Eitel who came into possession of the land at the death of her mother, Rebecca A. McCoppin shortly after her death in 1905. The land has been in the McCoppin family for over 100 years.\n\nGeorge Clinton McCoppin served in the Confederate Army and was discharged after the close of the War Between the States at Vicksburg, Mississippi. He traded a wool sweater made by his wife for a horse and rode back to Bowie County to rejoin his family.\n\nFrom this union were born six children:\n\nMary Jane McCoppin was born November 20, 1852 in Choctaw County, Mississippi and died September 25, 1910. She was married to Robert Morrow Johnson (see “Robert Morrow Johnson” as listed in index) April 1, 1868 in Bowie County, Texas. The following children were born to this union.\n\nEllen Johnson, born December 1868, married to Willie A. Welch early merchant of DeKalb, Texas. They had the following children: Arthur (deceased), Homer (deceased), Iva, who married Nathan Wright and now lives in Carlsbad, New Mexico, Robert (deceased), and Clyde, who lives in Austin, Texas.\n\nSusan Bulah Johnson, born January 28, 1871, died 1877.\n\nRobert Morrow Johnson, Jr. born July 28, 1873, died 1914, at one time served as Bowie County Tax Assessor, never married.\n\nSallie Johnson, born April 18, 1879, died 1880.\n\nEdward Webster Johnson, born July 20, 1881, died 1943.

They have two children: Bobbie Lee, married to Mercerd Hawkins, one child Greta Jean; and Charles who married Melba Kruse. Grover and his wife reside at Siloam near Simms, Texas, on the old Johnson plantation which comprises more than 1,000 acres.\n\nSue Francis McCoppin was born in Chocton County, at Greensboro, Miss., Aug. 15, 1854. She married Rev. Harvey Huley Echols July 13, 1871 in Bowie County, Texas. Rev. Echols died July 11, 1898 and Sue Francis Echols passed away in 1910 – both in New Boston, Texas. From this union were born eight children, of which only two are living: George Winston Echols, 610 East Elm Street, Hillsboro, Texas, and Lalla Rook Echols Salter, 4324 Glenwick Lane, Dallas 5, Texas.\n\nEthel, the oldest, married Henderson E.

They got as far as Missouri where they remained a year, then started again from Arkansas and at last reached Hempstead County where they settled at Washington, Arkansas. Arkansas was then a Territory and offered free homesteads to settlers.\n\nGrandfather McLain was married to Miss Bert, sister of F. Hewett Bert, Sr., who married Mary (Polly) Baird who was also the sister of my grandfather, Simon Baird, thus the McLain’s and Baird family have been related for several generations.

About 1885 he moved to Texarkana to a family home at 519 East 9th Street, where he lived until he passed away. He was always kind, courteous, and dignified; he was a gentleman of the “old school” and became one of Texarkana’s leading citizens. He amassed a comfortable estate which he left together with an honored name to his children.\n\nEgbert Powell McMickle\n\nEgbert Powell McMickle came to Texarkana from Paulding, Mississippi, Jasper County, in 1875.

Eleven children were born of this marriage: Jack, Anna, Abe, James Powell, Ella Josephine, Susan B., Virgie, Nellie Byl, Lillie Mae, Egbert Leroy, and Ethel Ledonia, twins.\n\nEgbert Powell’s father was William Squire McMickle, born February 26, 1806, in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, died in Paulding, Mississippi, Jasper County, September 10, 1861. His wife, Susan Daniel, born January 15, 1810, in Griffin, Georgia, died February 2, 1858. They were married November 6, 1827, in Monroe County, Georgia.

He was the seventh in direct line from the original immigrant, Richard Merrill, who landed on Staten Island in 1692, from which place descendants followed the frontiers through New Jersey into North Carolina. The direct line is as follows: Richard (1), William (2), William (3), Benjamin (4), William (5), Timothy (6). The family was conspicuously loyal to the colonies, one of them being a member of the Mecklenburg County militia and a signer of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence (1775). Benjamin (4) a Captain in the Colonial Guards, was hanged by the Tories and his lands confiscated, but these were later returned to his wife, Penelope, and his heirs. William (5), came through seven years colonial service unharmed, married Sally Haden and settled in North Carolina. From here his descendants drifted west to eastern Kentucky, Sumner and Carroll County, Tennessee, Arkansas territory, and finally in the 1830’s to Texas, receiving land grants in Fannin, Delta, and Hunt Counties. Timothy Merrill (6) received a grant in Mercer’s Colony, Hunt County in 1857. Richmond Pierson Merrill (7) received a grant of 320 acres May 28, 1850.\n\nHe was educated at McKenzie Institute, Clarksville, Texas, and began teaching the one-room frontier schools. Many prominent men of North East Texas learned the 3 R’s and discipline from R. P. Merrill. He came to Bowie County in the 1850’s and taught school at Red Bayou, four miles north of the present town of New Boston; he was a member of the Board of Stewards who in 1861 established the first Methodist Church in the County. In 1861 he entered the Confederate Army as a member of Company K, 11th Texas Calvary. His first detail was from the Pea Ridge Arkansas encampment, where he was assigned to return with materials to Boston, Texas, and have uniforms made for the Company. The women of Boston made the uniforms in the three weeks allotted; he rejoined his company and served the entire war with it. While foraging for provisions too near enemy lines he was shot through the ear by a sniper, his only injury. Being mustered out in Charleston, South Carolina, in the spring of 1865, and given his horse and saddle, he and a companion rode across the devastated South, living off the land for two months. Across Alabama and Mississippi blackberries were ripe.\n\nThe war over, R. P. Merrill began working at Myrtle Springs on the old post road paralleling Red River for Dr. Hooks, whose interests included a drug business at Jefferson, Texas, run by Dr. John Alford, a relative of the Hooks family. In 1886-87 Mr. Merrill was employed there learning pharmacy and making frequent trips to Bowie County. But the aftermath of war and the tragic conditions of reconstruction in the area were intolerable and on January 15, 1868, he and his brother, with Dr. Alford and wife, left Boston, Texas, for California. They traveled by carriage, stage, rail, and riverboat Lizzie Hopkins to New Orleans, arriving January 26. Through-tickets at Nashville, from where they visited Tennessee relatives and sent messages back to Texas. Through-tickets, New York to San Francisco via the isthmus of Panama, with cabin class accommodations as available were respectively $150.00 and $80.00 in greenback. They left New York by scheduled steamer and after a great deal of seasickness arrived at the isthmus February 18, crossing by “the cars” 47 miles through swamps to the Pacific, and embarking on the Constitution (“Old Ironsides,” War 1812) for ports of call and San Francisco. March 2nd log recorded a rough sea after leaving the Gulf of California and a waterspout was sighted. The next day the ship was struck by a tropical storm which lasted three days and delayed their scheduled arrival. Upon landing March 6, 1868, they found newspapers were carrying banner headlines: Old Constitution and All Aboard Lost.\n\nBut two days later, March 8, 1868, found him at the end of the rail line in Santa Clara and in San Jose in the home of George Stewart from Boston, Texas. Here learning that teacher’s were urgently needed he went to the Board of Education and took a three day examination in Spelling, Writing, Geography, History of the United States, Constitution of the United States, School Laws of California, English Grammar, Natural Philosophy, Arithmetic, and Algebra; he taught in the San Jose School three hours a day, twenty days a month for one month and was paid $50.00 in gold. He worked as a pharmacist as well as a teacher, as all frontier schools were short term and irregular, and was employed in Tule’ River, Visalia, Bakersfield, and Porterville; he served as County Superintendent of Schools of Tulare County. In 1872 he married Emily Catherine Coughran (b. 1845, Rocky Comfort, Arkansas), whose family left Brownstown, Arkansas in 1859, going by wagon train to California. They had seven children: James Edwin, Warren Hoskins, Lily Jewel, Zula Zong, Etta Wiley, Pearl Richmond, and Marvin Earl, five of whom were born in California. In 1881 the family returned overland to Texas and Mr. Merrill taught in Ballinger and Paint Rock. By the mid-1880’s they had reached home, Bowie County, and had renewed friendships with relatives, old settlers, and Civil War companions.\n\nBoston was moving northward. When the courthouse burned, his nephew Quincy H. Merrill gave the land for the new one and the street north through New Boston was named Merrill Street. Godley Prairie, Myrtle Springs, Chalybeate Springs, Three Springs and Red Springs were home to R. P. Merrill where the family living on a farm home depended on its produce as well as the meager salary from schools. It was the typical home of the period as well and the typical family. The fireside was the center of culture, guests were always welcome, conversation was entertainment. By the late 1890’s such a home was established at Corley: large rooms with high ceilings, open hallway, front porch and back “gallery,” hugh [sic] oak trees left standing, bee hives in the orchard, the smokehouse, the bored well, the spring under the hill. Inside: high beds with feather mattresses and handmade coverlets, Seth Thomas clock, pine cupboards, stoneware dishes, colonial rockers, family Bible and oil lamp on the reading table. These were the busy years of his life; the children were growing up, leaving for jobs and homes of their own and he was slowing down. At the turn of the century the last joint of his spine was removed, the result of an injury from his cavalry years. But the indomitable spirit was still strong; he was erect, dignified and active in his community. His newspaper, The Atlanta Constitution was eagerly read from headline to last period. Books were treasured and respected. The Bible, McGuffey readers, the blue-black speller, Peter Parley’s Universal History, the almanac, the family medical guide, the dictionary and factual reference books made up the home library. The Masonic Lodge, of which he had been a member since 21 years of age, had his deepest loyalty. He attended all Reunions of Confederate Veterans that were possible to reach, the last around 1908.\n\nOne daughter had died in California. His wife died in 1912 at the home of his daughter Zula in Texarkana; in 1913 Zula (McVeety) also died. In May, 1914, he was visiting in the home of his daughter, Pearl at Maud when the cyclone struck; then a man of 86, he was standing at the window trying to hold it in place when the house was completely destroyed and is daughter killed. The world was at war and in 1916 America entered it; the daily paper became a necessity. Awake and up the the day began, breakfast and coffee and his favorite pipe and he was ready for all with discussion of local, state, national, and world events. He spent the time with various members of the family, attended a performance of the Ringling Bros.-Barnum Bailey Circus in 1922, and in 1924 could still climb the stairs of the courthouse at Boston. He died April 4, 1924, at the age of ninety-six.\n\nSince the 1890’s the Merrill family has had representatives in Texarkana. At the present time these include two children of Warren Hoskins Merrill (d. 1943); Beulah Merrill Henley and Frank Coughran Merrill, and two children of Zula Merrill McVeety: Edwin McVeety and Marie McVeety Dennis; also two younger generations are represented.\n\nMarvin E. Merrill (m. Vivion Stokes 1918, two sons: Marvin Lofton and Richmond Stokes) is the youngest son of Richmond Pierson Merrill and the only surviving child. He has memories of Texarkana as sketchy as the city was at his earliest: He was privileged to come into town with an older brother to do the weekly trading. It was early morning; they waited along the streets for the stores to open; on Third Street off Main the first City Hall and jail was about to be erected, the ditches were being dug for the foundation. Much to the annoyance of his brother he climbed down and played along in the dirt and had to be helped out. Other memories: Mr. Kizer’s store was a good place to trade – he gave candy to children; the mule-drawn streetcar with a gaily tinkling bell was a thrilling sight when driven by a grownup brother; once he worked a week for a family neighbor, came into town on Saturday and spent his week’s wages having a tooth crowned; about 1907 he attended a Bowie County Teacher’s Institute and stayed at the E. K. N. Hotel at Third and Main. Another: It was the Fourth of July, 1908, and Texarkana celebrated with the customary picnic and political rally at Spring Lake Park. Bands played, flags flew, calliopes sounded, bunting draped everything, including the electric streetcars. With three girl acquaintances he caught the rear platform of a park bound car; he wore a white shirt, the girls wore white dresses and decorative hats. A summer storm came up and drenched them all; bunting colors ruined their hats and clothes, but the day was a great success. In 1912 he resided on West 24th Street off Pine; Bobotown was nearby; Highland Park was a wooded area; the Bob Hooks home and one or two others were the only dwellings until he reached the Collins place as he walked the mile and more to Henderson’s Business College in the 200 Block upstairs. He took his lunch as did the other students who were entering the business world in the city. Mr. Merrill and his wife live within two blocks of where he first resided and he is employed as Clerk of the Court of Civil Appeals, Sixth Supreme Judicial District, Texarkana, Texas, Municipal Building, where he has been since 1934.\n\nBibliography\n\n(1) Family records.\n\n(2) Photostats of original colony certificates Land Office, Austin, Texas.\n\n(3) A Genealogical History of the Merrill Family in North Carolina, by Prof. John Merrill, U. of N.

Mrs. Hodgens had two sons by a former marriage, George and Billy Briggs, and since Billy was about my age, we became playmates. Just across the alley, back of the Hodgens House, was L. C. Adam’s Livery Stable, and we enjoyed watching the beautiful horses being harnessed and rented to drivers. On the ground floor of the Hodgens House was “The Empire,” one of the first movie theatres in Texarkana. Somehow, in our childish minds, it was connected with the Japanese Empire, about which we had been studying, as it had just been involved in, and won the Russo-Japanese War. There was also a fruit stand operated by an Assyrian named A. Watkin. This man had returned to “the old country” and brought his bride to New Boston, where their first son was born. They named him Boston, in honor of the town. They they moved to Texarkana.\n\nOn Sunday afternoons all of our family would go for a walk, and sometimes would walk as far as “The Water Works,” on East Ninth Street, which was in the country at that time.\n\nMy father’s office was in the State National Bank Building, four blocks away, and to get there we had to pass at least one saloon in each block. They had swinging doors, and as the men went in and out we were intrigued to know what was inside. We could see sawdust under the doors but were cautioned by our parents not to try to look in.\n\nThere were no automobiles in Texarkana, and the more affluent owned horses and carriages. On Sunday afternoons it was the custom for families to take drives, and I remember the lovely matched spans of horses owned and driven by the families of T. L. L. Temple, W. T. Murphy, F. W. Offenhauser, M. D. Tilson and others.\n\nOne of the chief places of amusement for those not fortunate enough to own a carriage, was Spring Lake Park. To get there we rode the Hazel Street car out to 35th Street and Hazel, and then off at an angle, by the home of Wilbur Jacques, on to the Boulevard, which was through a pine woodland. The Lake at the Park looked huge to us, and across it was what looked like the longest bridge in the world. Deer, which had been donated to the Park, roamed in a fenced-in pine woodland.\n\nEach summer, Texarkana was on a Chatauqua circuit. Sometimes this was shown in a tent on the block where Sears-Roebuck and the Gazette Building now stands. At other times it was held in a pavilion at Spring Lake Park. I remember when a group of opera singers had performed at this pavilion and later rented boats and rode about on the lake, singing their songs. It was a thrill to hear them sing in Italian, “Ciri Biri Din.”\n\nI remember many of Texarkana’s Birthday Celebrations (Dec. 8), with the triangle in front of the Offenhauser Building the focal point.\n\nThe Ringling Brothers’ Circus parades down the full length of Broad Street was also a never to be forgotten thrill.\n\nCharles Moores and Allied Families\n\nTo Attract Relatives From Near and Far\n\nDirect Descendants of Charles Moores, and Allied Families, to have Gay Reunion Sunday\n\n(Reprint from Texarkana Daily News, Thursday, June 26, 1958)\n\nBy Annie May Turner\n\nDaily News Women’s Editor\n\nSunday, June 29, will be a great day for descendants of Charles and Mary Moores, early Texas pioneers who came to this part of the country when it was but a wilderness, “way out West.”\n\nSeveral hundred persons, members of the Moores, Ross, Harrison, Morriss, Rochelle, Godbold, Hooks, Whitaker, Watts, Rosborough, Janes, Fontaine, Cullom and other families will assemble in and around the pavilion at Spring Lake Park, situated a short distance from what once was the camp site of the Spanish soldier-explorer, Fernando De Soto, and followers. Old letters, papers, family Bibles, historical pictures and other keepsakes will be on display, as well as information on the coat of arms used by the Moores of Europe generations ago.\n\nBlue (truth and sincerity), gold (stainless honor) and red (military fortitude) were the colors of the heraldic emblem. The crest was an eagle “rising proper,” which donated high ambition, strength and ideals. Another feature was a saltire, or St. Andrew’s Cross, given as a token of valor to a crusader who fought valiantly in Holy Wars. Palets, also given to a crusader, represented staves of wood used in walking on long journeys, and annulets indicated strong family ties. “Juravi et adjuravi” – (I have sworn and have been sworn by. I have sworn and have taken a vow) – was the motto.\n\nTexas Pioneers\n\nCharles Moores, born in 1776 in Lincoln County, North Carolina, was the oldest son of Henry and Jean (or Jane) Ross Moores. His father, a lieutenant in Capt. William Mitchells’ company in the South Carolina Regiment of Artillery, was taken prisoner, during the Revolutionary War, in Charleston, May 2, 1780.\n\nHis wife was Mary Harrison of Longtown, S. C., daughter of Reuben and Sarah Burgess Harrison, who were early settlers in Fairfield County, where they faced hardships of pioneer life and depredations of ruthless Cherokee Indian tribes. Mary’s father was in Capt. Thomas Stark’s company, and Revolutionary War records mention several raids in which he participated.\n\nCharles and Mary were the parents of 14 sons and daughters – Nancy Harrison, Sarah, Elizabeth, Eli, Reuben, Jane Ross, Charles H. (died in infancy), Thomas Briggs, Richard, Mary David, Frances and William Henry Harrison.\n\nIn 1837, Charles and his five oldest sons, Eli, Reuben, Thomas Briggs, Anderson Rochelle and David scouted this area. When their father and brothers returned to Longtown to get the rest of the family, Eli and Reuben, with the help of slaves, cleared land, prepared fields for cultivation and built slave quarters.\n\nOn February 27, 1840, Charles, Mary and others in the family, with slaves and livestock, traveling by ox cart and wagon train, began the long, arduous trip from Longtown to Texas, and their arrival here marked the beginning of the Old Redwater road.\n\nA daily log of the three-month trip, kept by Anderson Rochelle, tells how they traveled first to Winnsoboro, then over the Blue Ridge, to Asheville, N. C., and on to Tennessee, where Thomas Briggs Moores married his cousin, a Miss Norvell of Bell Buckle. After the wedding, a festive occasion, the bride, bridegroom and others in the party made their way across the state to Memphis, where they crossed the Mississippi river by ferry.\n\nAbout 26 days later they were in Little Rock. As the trip continued they passed through Benton and Washington, then were waterbound two days by Red river. After the crossing they went through Lost Prairie, and on May 24 “arrived home.”\n\nWhere they lived\n\nCharles induced his sons-in-law, cousins and many others to come to this area. This was proved by old letters found by Mrs. J. C. Harkness (formerly Lucille Cullom) during remodeling of the home of her mother, Mrs. Maria Ross Moores Cullom, at 710 Main street.\n\nA plantation home for himself and family was built by Charles. He named it “Sweet Springs,” and added to the attractiveness of the grounds by creating a lake directly in front of the house.\n\nCharles owned a great many slaves. Many insisted on remaining with the family after they were freed.\n\nThe daughters of Charles and Mary married into the Rochelle, Moore, Whitaker and Rosborough families. Their sons, other than Thomas Briggs, married members of the Godbold, Jarrette, Allen, Janes, Cooper, Ross and Douglas clans.\n\nMrs. Sam Ragland, Sr., now lives in the town house of Rachel Godbold Moores. She is a descendant of Charles and Mary through Sarah Moores Whitaker.\n\nAcross the street from the Ragland home was the home of Mrs. Nora Moores Fontaine, the only living granddaughter of Charles and Mary. She now is in Austin with her daughter, Mrs. D. C. Harkrider.\n\nThe plantation home of David and Rachel was in Cass County, near what now is the Texarkana Dam. Gold was buried on the plantation during the War Between the States, and left there many years. When it was recovered, Mrs. Moores, S. H. Vance and a Mr. Powell drove other there the watch the digging. Mrs. Moores had a map showing where it was hidden.\n\nThe home of Reuben and Jane Godbold Moores, also was in Cass County near Texarkana Dam. He was the first postmaster of Mooresville.\n\nDuring the War Between the States when the home of Elizabeth Godbold Watts, in Center Ridge, Ark., was used as a hospital and relay station, she sent her slaves and wagons filled with precious possession to the home of Reuben and Jane for safe keeping.\n\nThe home of Mrs. Jane Moores Morriss, daughter of Reuben and Jane, was at 1101 Wood street.\n\nWilliam H. H. Moores, youngest son of Charles and Mary, inherited “Sweet Springs,” and made it a showplace. A small table was sunk into the lake in front of the house, and at the ringing of a bell, fish would come up to be fed. A tiny island in the lake enchanted visitors taken for rides in quaint boats, and ducks on the lake were shot by hunters on the front porch. Beautiful flowers surrounded slave quarters behind the house.\n\nMany letters found\n\nLetters now in the hands of the family were written by William while he was in Princeton, N. J. Willis Whitaker, Jr., was there at that time. The latter’s father, Willis Whitaker, Sr., first was married to Sarah Moores, and after her death became the husband of her widowed sister, Elizabeth Moores Rosborough.\n\nThe oldest family landmark in Texarkana is the home of Eli and Minerva Janes Moores, at 1609 New Boston road. It now is the home of Mrs. Minerva Watts Pryor. Eli was the oldest son, and the property was given him by his father “in consideration of natural affection,” as the 1847 deed reveals.\n\nThere have been may [sic] tall tales of how Eli, called “Mr. Pioneer Texarkana” by one writer, acquired the land on which down town Texarkana, Tex. now stands. One story is that it was traded for a yoke of oxen and a wagon by a Negro widow, but Eli had the land as early as 1859 and paid taxes 30 years.\n\nEli gave the railroad some land, and also donated lots for five churches – two were for Negros.\n\nParticular Girl\n\nBefore Charles Moores moved the rest of his family to Texas, his daughter, Jane Ross, in Longtown, wrote a letter to her brother, Reuben.\n\nIt was dated Dec. 16, 1838, and gave news of the family as well as her matrimonial intentions. Excerpts tell:\n\n“Sister Elizabeth H. Moores was married to Doctor James T. Rosborough on the 22nd of November. Doctor Rosborough and his lady have been staying with us since they were married. I do not expect that the doctor will go to Texas as his practice is very extensive in his neighborhood, and he has a good practice in Longtown. We had no doctor in Longtown since Doctor Abbott died.\n\n“Cousin John Harrison was married to Miss Woodward of Winnsboro in October last, and had large parties given for them by Uncle John Harrison and cousin, John Bryant. They were dancing parties.\n\n“Cousin Mary Harrison will be marrying Mr. Dranghan of New Orleans in a few weeks.\n\n“Longtown is resuming its former gaiety, although persons here are emigrating very fast. There are very few young ladies in Longtown at this time. I have never heard of so many marriages as in last year.\n\n“I have not the most distant idea of marrying until I get to Texas although I have many admirers at this time who are endeavoring to dissuade me. But I do not think I can companion of any of them. I flatter myself I can do better in Texas.\n\n“I heard a report current in Longtown a few months since, relative to my marrying Doctor Jones. The report was entirely false, and I am glad it was.\n\n“Tell Cousin William Moores that I wish him to select me one of the most magnificent looking gentlemen that Texas affords, and keep him in reserve for me until I emigrate to Texas. Tell him not to select one of your common looking sort of men, as I have neglected so many fine looking men in Carolina for one in Texas.\n\n“Cousin William must give the gentlemen a very flattering description of me, as you know my external appearance will require a good deal of flattering. As ladies are not very numerous in Texas, I presume I will stand a pretty good chance. At any rate, I go to Texas as Miss Moores.”\n\nLater on, after coming here, she married James Moore. They moved to Paris, Texas.\n\nNancy Moores, oldest daughter of Charles and Mary, married James Rochelle. After this couple died in South Carolina Charles Moores brought his four grandsons to Texas about 1844. John Ross Rochelle lived near Myrtle Springs, Charles Moores Rochelle lived near Nash, Henry Pinkney Rochelle’s headright survey was in North Texarkana, and Dr. Eugene Rochelle lived in Bowie County. They were slave owners.\n\nSarah Norvell, wife of Thomas Briggs Moores, headed Magnolia tree planting in Mt. Pleasant. Their son, Charley Washington Moores was vice president of Texarkana National Bank (succeeded by Ben Collins) and was president of the Mt. Pleasant Bank.\n\nAnderson Rochelle Moores married Pauline Jarrett and their family lived at Old Richmond, Ark. Their son, Anderson Ross Moores was one of the first Aldermen of Texarkana.\n\nAfter the death of Dr. James Rosborough, Elizabeth H. Moores Rosborough came to Texas, where their daughter, Mary, married James Hooks. The son of Dr. and Mrs. Rosborough was Capt. James T. Rosborough, whose home was at 501 Maple Street, now Texas avenue. Old-timers are reminded of Capt. Rosborough and his beloved wife, Mattie, when they pass the Confederate Monument on State Line.\n\nWilliam was married three times. His first wife was Matilda Cooper, second Maria Ross (Adams), third Mary L. Douglas. The family’s town house was at what now is 712 Olive street.\n\nRichard H. and sister, Mary Harrison, died unmarried.\n\nKith and Kin\n\nAn uncle of Charles Moores, William Moores, married Elizabeth Ross the sister-in-law of his brother, Lt. Henry Moores. John Wesley Moores of Arkadelphia, Ark., is a descendant of the couple.\n\nCharles and Mary Moores are among the four generations of the family buried in Harrison Chapel Cemetery on Old Redwater road. Reunion visitors will visit the graves of the early pioneers. The cemetery recently was cleared.\n\nMrs. Arthur Jennings is a double great-great granddaughter of Charles and Mary in direct descent from William Henry Harrison Moores on her mother’s line, and Eli Moores on her father’s.\n\nAmong pioneers who were early neighbors, other friends and in-laws of Charles and Mary were the Culloms, Estes, Collom, Trigg, Talbot, Jarrett, Janes, McKinley, Whitaker, Rochelle, Rosborough, Harrison, Feazelle, Godbold, Benefield, Brinlee, Latimer, Hooks, Holman, Dalby, Wooten, Wright, Bradshaw, Runnells, Hemphills, Bizzell, Braden, Lane, Brookshire, Burton, Henry, Lupton, Cantrell, Powell, Shipp, Glass, Carpenter, Boone, Smith, Day, Elliott, McWhorter, Page and Gaither families.\n\nRegistration at the reunion will begin at 9 a.m. After morning church services, a picnic will be held.\n\nThere will be prizes for the oldest and youngest members of the family, and the one who has traveled the greatest distance to attend the reunion.\n\nMrs. Minerva Watts Pryor and brother, Monroe Watts, will entertain early comers with a party Saturday night. It will take place in her colonial home on New Boston road.\n\nFrom clipping Texarkana Gazette Monday, June 30 in front page article by Sally Reese headed “Over 300 Attend Moores Family Reunion Here”:\n\n“Charles and Mary Harrison Moores would have been very proud Sunday. Charles and Mary had 14 children. Well over 300 of their descendants came together at Spring Lake Park for a family reunion . . . . Those descendents who represent some of Texarkana’s oldest and finest families were reunited with or met for the first time, others who came from California, Ohio, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. A golden shovel was presented to James and Betty Moores of Fayetteville, Tenn., who only a few days ago discovered the grave of Henry Moores (died 1814), father of Charles who was born the same year as American Independence. Through his 14 children Charles Moores had left his mark on Arkansas and Texas, sparsely settled territory to which he brought his family just a few years after the Republic of Texas was formed.\n\nCharles Harrison Moores and his wife,\n\nMary Tamar Hargroves Moores\n\nCharles Harrison Moores b. Dec. 17, 1848, Bowie County, d. June 12, 1906; Texarkana; buried Moores Chapel Cemetery; married Dec. 23, 1880, Texarkana (son of Eli Harrison Moores and Minerva Ann Janes).\n\nMary Tamar Hargrove Moores b.

Hargrove of Confederate Army, Miss.)\n\nCharley owned 320 acres of hill land on both sides (and including) of what is now Moores Lane. Here he built, in 1885-86, a colonial-style house. He owned 1200 acres of "
