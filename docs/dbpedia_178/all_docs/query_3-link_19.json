This volume has been produced with the utmost care to recreate the original edition as it was. This is a project of a local church in Birmingham, Alabama and is truly a labor of love.\n\n\"I have been collecting editions of 'The Pilgrim's Progress' for 25 years and this is undoubtedly my favorite. It is a faithful reprint of an 1891 edition. The cover is a work of art. The 170 illustrations inside are beautifully done and very helpful to visualize what Bunyan has in print. This oversize book is great to gather the family around and read together. The education of a child is not complete until they have read this complete edition of Bunyan's immortal work.\" - Pastor Mark Liddle, Dominion Baptist Church, Birmingham, AL\n\nJOHN BUNYAN [1628-1888] was C. H. Spurgeon's favorite author and his legendary work, THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS, is the most popular book ever written apart from Holy Scripture. Spurgeon loved reading and re-reading this work, claiming to have read it over 100 times!many times with his wife reading it to him in afternoon relaxation and meditation. He often quoted Bunyan in his sermons declaring, \"Though his writings are charmingly full of poetry, yet he cannot give us his Pilgrim's Progress, that sweetest of all prose poems, without continually making us feel and say, 'Why, this man is a living Bible!' Prick him anywhere, his blood is Bibline, the very essence of the Bible flows from him. He cannot speak without quoting a text, for his very soul is FULL of the Word of God.\"\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS FOUR-PACK CONSISTS OF -\n\n1891 ILLUSTRATED HARDCOVER EDITION OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ($42.00 Value)\n\nLECTURES ON PILGRIM'S PROGRESS & THE LIFE OF BUNYAN BY CHEEVER ($30.00 Value)\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH MARGINAL NOTES EDITED BY GEORGE OFFOR ($18.00 Value)\n\n1000 PIECE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS PUZZLE ($30.00 Value)\n\nPP Special sgpc dtdm\n\nPP2 ms8 nh12 10/3 bs1 ps6 bl2 tm9 fw5 pdt css bfs ovt mg68 PP5 /18 svs nhp bfss OVST 12s pp6 TT3 mg70 PP4*\n\nHARD-COVER, SMYTH-SEWN, ILLUSTRATED EDITION\n\nSGCB Price: $22.00 (list price $42.00)\n\n45% Discount\n\nORDER WITH OUR HARDCOVER EDITION OF 'LECTURES ON PILGRIM'S PROGRESS' BY GEORGE CHEEVER\n\nSGCB Price: $26.00 (list price $72.00)\n\nTHIS IS THE PRICE FOR BOTH HARDCOVER TITLES\n\nORDER OUR 'PILGRIM'S PROGRESS' FOUR-PACK AND SAVE EVEN MORE (OVER 70%)\n\nSGCB Price: $36.00 (list price $120.00)\n\nINCLUDES THE 1891 HARDCOVER, CHEEVER'S LECTURES, OFFOR FOOTNOTED EDITION & 1000 PIECE PUZZLE\n\nclick for detailsTHE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS: Edited by George Offor, including Bunyans own Marginal Notes\n\nJOHN BUNYAN\n\nTHIS IS A COMPLETE, UNABRIDGED EDITION CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL MARGINAL NOTES OF JOHN BUNYAN.\n\nOther than the Bible, there is no book written in the English language that has been published more than The Pilgrims Progress, by John Bunyan. We believe there are two primary reasons for this. First, the book is thoroughly and eminently Scriptural. But secondly, and just as importantly, it is profoundly practical, being a deeply experiential and spiritual account of the realities of the true Christian call, conversion, walk, opposition, and spiritual rewards, both temporal and eternal; all applied to pilgrims of various gifts and capacities.\n\nThe main reason this particular edition of Pilgrims Progress was selected is because the original editor, George Offor, carefully reviewed all eight of Bunyans own editions being careful to produce a copy that adhered strictly to Bunyans own revisions of the text. But in addition, Offor was also careful to include Bunyans Marginal Notes. Bunyan himself provided these notes and insisted that they were one major key to understanding the text, the other being the illuminating work of The Spirit. We have made no changes to Offors/Bunyans text in this edition. May it be blessed to your soul as it has been to millions before you is our prayer.\n\nCharles H. Spurgeon loved reading and re-reading this work, claiming to have read it over 100 times! Quite often his wife read it to him in the afternoon for relaxation and meditation. He often quoted Bunyan in his sermons declaring, \"Though his writings are charmingly full of poetry, yet he cannot give us his Pilgrim's Progress, that sweetest of all prose poems, without continually making us feel and say, 'Why, this man is a living Bible!' Prick him anywhere, his blood is Bibline, the very essence of the Bible flows from him. He cannot speak without quoting a text, for his very soul is full of the Word of God.\"\n\nGeorge Whitefield said of this book, \"It smells of the prison. It was written when the author was confined in Bedford jail. And ministers never write or preach so well as when under the cross: the Spirit of Christ and of Glory then rests upon them.\"\n\nJohn Newton added, \"Of all our author's writings, there is no one perhaps so universally and deservedly admired as his Pilgrim's Progress, in which he gives a delineation of the Christian life under the idea of a journey or a pilgrimage, from the City of Destruction to the heavenly Jerusalem. In this treatise Bunyan appears not only as a writer well instructed in the mysteries of the kingdom, but a man of real genius.\"\n\nJohn Owen once went to hear John Bunyan preach. Charles II, hearing of it, asked the doctor why someone as thoroughly educated as he would want to hear a mere tinker preach. Owen replied, \"May it please your Majesty, if I could possess the tinker's abilities to grip men's hearts, I would gladly give in exchange all my learning.\"\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS FOUR-PACK CONSISTS OF -\n\n1891 ILLUSTRATED HARDCOVER EDITION OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ($42.00 Value)\n\nLECTURES ON PILGRIM'S PROGRESS & THE LIFE OF BUNYAN BY CHEEVER ($30.00 Value)\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH MARGINAL NOTES EDITED BY GEORGE OFFOR ($18.00 Value)\n\n1000 PIECE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS PUZZLE ($30.00 Value)\n\npp22 bs1 bl2 dtdm fw5 pdt bfs ovt 6g 5s pp5 /18 /04 svs nhp OVST pp6\n\nPP5\n\nstst TT3 mg70 cwxs PP4* 24OSS\n\nBRAND NEW PRICE NEARLY 50% OFF\n\nSGCB Price: $9.95 (list price $18.00)\n\nTHIS BEAUTIFUL PAPERBACK EDITION IS NOW AVAILABLE TO SHIP\n\nORDER WITH OUR NEW 'PILGRIM'S PROGRESS' FOUR-PACK (NEARLY 70% OFF)\n\nSGCB Price: $36.00 (list price $120.00)\n\nINCLUDES THE 1891 HARDCOVER, CHEEVER'S LECTURES, OFFOR FOOTNOTED EDITION & 1000 PIECE PUZZLE\n\nclick for detailsTRIUMPHANT JOURNEY: 1000 Piece Puzzle of PILGRIM'S PROGRESS by John Bunyan\n\nJohn Bunyan\n\nINCREDIBLE SALE - OVER 75% OFF THESE 1000 PIECE PUZZLES\n\nSPECIAL NOTICE - WE CANNOT SHIP THESE BY MEDIA MAIL - THE COST TO SHIP ONE PUZZLE BY USPS MAIL IS $10.00 - WE ARE SORRY BUT MEDIA MAIL IS NOT FOR PUZZLES\n\n\"Triumphant Journey\"\n\nAn excellent art rendition of John Bunyan's famous allegory, \"The Pilgrim's Progress\".\n\n1,000 interlocking piece puzzle\n\nWhen assembled: 30\" x 22\"\n\nThe puzzle is a full color art rendition of John Bunyan's classic allegory: The Pilgrim's Progress\n\nIncludes: 1 FREE 12-page booklet with written descriptions and scripture references for each event of Christian's adventure in the art rendition puzzle\n\nPackaging: 2 piece box, 14\" x 10\" x 2\"\n\nAbout Pilgrim's Progress: John Bunyan, persecuted for his faith, in the cold isolation of a prison cell awoke from a dream.

And yet it is not new, but as old as the grace of God in the heart of sinful man; and now, so many have crossed the sea, and prepared charts and maps of their passage for the use of others, that there is scarcely a league over which some compass has not been drawn, or into which some fathoming line has not been let down; though there is scenery still hidden, and there are depths never yet sounded, nor ever will be, inasmuch as the grace of God in the heart of man is unfathomable; and in sailing over this ocean we can often do no more than cry out with the apostle Paul, 'O the depths!' There is always much that is peculiar with every individual mind in crossing this sea; and likewise in following the traces of so experienced and wise a navigator as Bunyan every individual will find something new to remark upon; so that these lectures, though on an old subject, will not necessarily be found commonplace, or monotonous, or superfluous.\n\nThis excellent commentary on Pilgrim's Progress consists on 10 Lectures.\n\nThe first nine lectures cover Pilgrim's Progress: Part One, and the final lecture covers the journey of Christiana to the Celestial City.\n\nThese are spiritually enriching lectures that will not only help you appreciate Pilgrim's Progress, but also the Bible itself.\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS FOUR-PACK CONSISTS OF -\n\n1891 ILLUSTRATED HARDCOVER EDITION OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ($42.00 Value)\n\nLECTURES ON PILGRIM'S PROGRESS & THE LIFE OF BUNYAN BY CHEEVER ($30.00 Value)\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH MARGINAL NOTES EDITED BY GEORGE OFFOR ($18.00 Value)\n\n1000 PIECE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS PUZZLE ($30.00 Value)\n\nPP6 Special ms8 PP2 2-5 bl2 dtdm fw5 pdt css bfs ovt 6g pp5 /18 /04 10s ovst TT3 20AS mg70 bl44 $5O PP4* 552923 5P720 24OSS HCS\n\nOver 80% Discount\n\nSGCB Price: $5.00 (list price $30.00)\n\nTHIS VOLUME IS NOW AVAILABLE\n\nORDER WITH OUR '1891 DELUXE ILLUSTRATED PILGRIM'S PROGRESS' HARDCOVER EDITION\n\nSGCB Price: $26.00 (list price $72.00)\n\nNEARLY 65% DISCOUNT FOR THESE TWO GREAT HARDCOVER VOLUMES\n\nORDER WITH OUR NEW 'PILGRIM'S PROGRESS' FOUR-PACK (70% OFF)\n\nSGCB Price: $36.00 (list price $120.00)\n\nINCLUDES THE 1891 HARDCOVER, CHEEVER'S LECTURES, OFFOR FOOTNOTED EDITION & 1000 PIECE PUZZLE\n\nclick for detailsSIGHS FROM HELL: The Groans of a Damned Soul, Being an Exposition of Luke 16\n\nJohn Bunyan, edited by Dr. Don Kistler\n\nSIGHS FROM HELL: The Groans of a Damned Soul by John Bunyan\n\nThis book is especially timely in light of Rob Bell's recent book release called \"Love Wins,\" in which he denies a literal hell, other than the one we make for ourselves. But over 300 years ago John Bunyan wrote this little work in which he exposits the story in Luke 16 of Dives and Lazarus, and shows biblically that hell is quite literal---at least Jesus thought so!\n\nThis book has been slightly updated as to language and grammar. It is hardbound and printed on acid-free paper. While this work of Bunyan's is not as well known as \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" it is very important, particularly for evangelism. This is what sinners need to be saved from!\n\nAn exposition of those words in Luke 16 concerning the rich man and the beggar wherein is discovered the lamentable state of the damned: their cries, their desires in their distresses, with the determination of God upon them; a good warning word to sinners, both old and young, to take into consideration quickly, and to see by faith in Jesus Christ to avoid, lest they come into the same place of torment.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nTo the Christian Reader by Bunyan\n\n1. The Two Men: Godly and Ungodly\n\n2. Both Departed Out of This Life\n\n3. The Proper Places of Both After Death\n\n4. The Ungodly Repented Too Late\n\n5.

In those early days as a young Christian, my tendency toward morbid introspection caused great mental anguish concerning the assurance of my salvation. During that dark period, I first became acquainted with John Bunyan when I was given two of his books, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners and The Pilgrim's Progress. At first I was actually afraid to read them, afraid that they would confirm my worst fears.\n\nHowever, as I began to read and ponder these works written so long ago, a glimmer of hope began to arise in my mind. I was not alone after all! John Bunyan suffered the very same things and wrote of them. At last I could give a name to the spiritual turmoil I had so often experienced. It was the murky Slough of Despond. The tormenting fear that so often held my heart and mind captive also had a name, Doubting Castle, baronial estate of Giant Despair. Thus I felt an immediate affinity with the humble tinker of Bedford that greatly encouraged me in those first days of my own pilgrimage.\n\nMany years later when I was asked to teach The Pilgrim's Progress to our teenagers in Sunday school, I gladly accepted the challenge and began an in-depth study of that great work. Using those early lessons as a foundation, I later expanded and revised them into a series of thirty meditational studies that were published in Adam's Rib, a monthly periodical especially designed for Christian women. These meditations provided the framework for an even more comprehensive study that resulted in the writing of this book.\n\nI truly believe that we write best of what we have learned from personal experience. At this point in my own journey, I have covered much of the ground that John Bunyan's pilgrim did and met the same characters he encountered along the way. As a result, I am well acquainted with the places Christian visited, as well as the trials, temptations, and difficulties he faced. An added benefit from the Lord is the privilege of being married to a godly pastor who faithfully expounds and teaches the Word of God. For the past forty-five years, I have served by my husband's side as his helper and co-laborer. The experience I have gained through the years and the spiritual lessons learned have been of invaluable assistance in giving me a more thorough understanding of The Pilgrim's Progress.\n\nThis best known work by John Bunyan is a captivating story told in a highly dramatic setting; but for those with eyes to see, it is much more than that. The truths of which he wrote are just as relevant to the people of God today as when he penned them in the 17th century. Therefore, every true child of God will find that he is on familiar ground when reading of Christian and his journey to the Celestial City.\"\n\nA strong endorsement was sent by Mack Tomlinson, Pastor of Providence Chapel, Denton, Texas-\n\n\"I am so glad this wonderful commentary on John Bunyan's 'The Pilgrim's Progress' will soon be available! I have been looking forward to it for a long time. When I first read through the manuscript, some of my first thoughts were, \"This is wonderful! Here is insightful interpretation, rich exposition, and wonderful practical application for the Christian life--this is truly quality, insightful, and excellent in every way!\" Carolyn Staley has truly captured Bunyan's heart in understanding his classic work.\n\nFrom the introduction and all the way through all fifty-three chapters of the wonderful work, Mrs. Staley has provided a marvelous gift to God's people in writing this superb work of exposition on Bunyan's masterful allegory. This book possibly breaks brand new ground in expounding on Bunyan's character of Christian as he journeys to the celestial city. While reading, I gained valuable new insights on certain points I have never seen or considered, and Bunyan's views on certain points were opened to me more than ever.\n\nAs is stated in the preface, the author considers at length the characters and places of Christian's pilgrimage, and has successfully endeavored to interpret Bunyan's lessons in light of the truth of Scripture. One of the great blessings of the book is the great number of scripture passages Mrs. Staley uses to interpret Bunyan's truth on the Christian life and journey. What a marvelous group study this volume will make! I heartily recommend it for that specifically.\n\nEspecially for those who have never read The Pilgrim's Progress, this book will yield rich treasures as one reads it along with Bunyan's work or just reads it by itself. Carolyn Staley has given Christ's church a marvelous book for generations to come, and I hope everyone who hears of it will buy it. I am persuaded that those who read it will be very thankful they did!\"\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPreface\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrologue\n\nPART ONE: THE JOURNEY COMMENCES\n\n1.

The account is historical fiction, told largely from the vantage point of his blind daughter, Mary, his first-born child and constant joy.\n\nMary became Bunyan's loyal, constant companion on every occasion when the authorities would permit her to visit her father at the prison, and his persistent petitioner for mercy and release before King Charles. This stirring account of how a young girl's faith in God grew, rather than diminished, during times of persecution, is an inspiring example of peculiar beauty for all believers today.\n\nNOW AVAILABLE TO SHIP!\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS FIVE-PACK CONSISTS OF -\n\n1891 ILLUSTRATED HARDCOVER EDITION OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ($40.00 Value)\n\nLECTURES ON PILGRIM'S PROGRESS & THE LIFE OF BUNYAN BY CHEEVER ($30.00 Value)\n\nPILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH MARGINAL NOTES EDITED BY GEORGE OFFOR ($15.00 Value)\n\n1000 PIECE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS PUZZLE ($30.00 Value)\n\nMARY BUNYAN: A Tale of Religious Persecution and Heroic Faith ($25.00 Value)\n\nPP Special /18 pp2\n\nNearly 50% Discount\n\nSGCB Price: $12.95 (list price $25.00)\n\nORDER WITH OUR PILGRIM'S PROGRESS FIVE-PACK\n\nSGCB Price: $54.00 (list price $140.00)\n\nclick for detailsBUNYAN'S CLASSICS\n\nJohn Bunyan\n\nDUE TO RISING COSTS THE RETAIL PRICE HAS NOW RISEN TO $79.99\n\nJohn Bunyan's famous work, The Pilgrim's Progress is, next to the Bible, the most popular book ever published.

Spurgeon\n\nJOHN BUNYAN [1628-1888] was C. H. Spurgeon's favorite author and his legendary work, THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS, is the most popular book ever written apart from Holy Scripture. Spurgeon loved reading and re-reading this work, claiming to have read it over 100 times! many times with his wife reading it to him in afternoon relaxation and meditation. He often quoted Bunyan in his sermons declaring, \"Though his writings are charmingly full of poetry, yet he cannot give us his Pilgrim's Progress, that sweetest of all prose poems, without continually making us feel and say, 'Why, this man is a living Bible!' Prick him anywhere; his blood is Bibline, the very essence of the Bible flows from him. He cannot speak without quoting a text, for his very soul is FULL of the Word of God.\"\n\nSpurgeon first became enthralled with this classic when but a small child, in the attic of his grandfather's manse. The old wood-cut illustrations were especially interesting to the young lad, and later his sermons were quite saturated with references to the characters and events in the story. Thomas Spurgeon, one of his twin sons, wrote the preface to these articles which were first published in The Sword and the Trowel Magazine after C. H. Spurgeon's death.\n\nPP Special\n\nSGCB Price: $12.50 (list price $15.00)"
