At age 12, he ran away to work as a deckhand on an Arkansas River flatboat. In 1818, he signed the petition that Arkansas Territory be formed from the southern part of the Missouri Territory.\n\nReligion: 1825 Arkansas.[2]\n\nHe underwent a conversion at a prayer meeting and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. He later served for ten years in Arkansas and southern Missouri as an itinerant preacher.\n\nMarried: Mary Greenlee Stewart, 25 Jun 1825 Clark County, Arkansas.[2][5]\n\n(her 1st husband; 6 children)\n\nAfter John's death, Mary married a Mr. McKenzie & they moved to Titus County. Nothing further known of her.\n\nTax List: 1828 Caddo Twp, Clark County, Arkansas.[6]\n\nMigration: Red River County, Texas.\n\nCrossed the river in company with Littleton Fowler (a preacher of some note) and settled near Clarksville.\n\nOccupation: abt 1838 Clarksville, Red River County, Texas.\n\nBecause the money he earned as a preacher was inadequate to support his family, he undertook the study of law. Six months later he was licensed to practice and went into partnership with John B. Craig at Clarksville.\n\nLand: 4 Oct 1838 Red River County, Texas.[7]\n\nReceived conditional land certificate #303, final certificate #24 (Red River, 3rd Class). Witnesses: John Stiles & Gilbert Clark.\n\nTax List: 1839 Hempstead County, Arkansas.[6]\n\nMilitary: abt 1840 Texas.[2]\n\nCaptain of a militia company under Col. Edward Tarrant.\n\nWill: 15 Jul 1840 Red River County, Texas.[8]\n\nThe Republic of Texas\n\nCounty of Red River\n\nWitness all men by these presents---\n\nThat I John B. Denton in view of the Mortality of man do make this my last will and Testament---\n\nFirst I will that my debts be paid out of my property.\n\n2nd I will that my beloved Wife Mary Denton have and hold all my personal property during her life,\n\n3rdly I will to my beloved Wife Mary six hundred and forty acres of land which I attained as a headright from the government of Texas. And also three hundred and twenty acres of land part of an undivided section belonging to Craig & Denton [i.e., his law partnership in Clarksville] West of Decable[?] on Mud Creek in fee simple to her and her heirs forever.\n\n4th I will to my daughter Elizabeth in fee simple one thousand acres of land to be taken out of the land held by Craig & Denton in partnership.\n\n5th The ballance of my undivided interest in land held with J.B. Craig to be Equally divided with my son Johnathan Denton my Daughter Narcissa J. Denton my son Eldridge H. Denton my son Ashley N. Denton & my son Brunard P.

Sometimes called \"Batttle of Village Creek,\" but it was only a small, brief skirmish.\n\nHandbook of Texas says he was killed while leading a company of Gen. Tarrant's militia in an organized attack on Keechi Village, and was struck by a rifle ball in the chest, dying instantly. This conflicts with the later account of Henry Stout, who helped bury him at the confluence of Oliver Creek & Denton Creek.\n\nBuried: County Courthouse, Denton, Denton County, Texas.[1][2][3]\n\nOriginally buried in an unmarked grave near the confluence of Oliver Creek & Denton Creek. Henry B. Stout, about 30 years later, was able to relocate Denton's grave, and the remains were reburied by John S. Chisum in a wooden box in the corner of the yard of his home on Clear Creek, near Bolivar. In 1901, the Pioneer Association of Denton County, after diligent search and thorough careful identification, again removed the remains and buried them with appropriate ceremonies in the southeast corner of the Denton County Courthouse lawn.\n\nProbate: Nov 18484 Clarksville, Red River County, Texas.[9]\n\nJohn D. Craig appointed executor of his estate in regard to some land he owned in Harrison County.\n\nCensus 1930\n\nClark County, Arkansas, p. 198.[10]\n\nDenton, John\n\nMales\n\nunder 5 = 1\n\n20-29 = 1\n\nFemales\n\nunder 5 = 2\n\n20-29 = 1\n\nJohn Denton was a Texan.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 John B Denton, Find A Grave: Memorial #14005053, accessed September 26, 2018.\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 Denton, John Bunyan, Handbook of Texas Online, accessed September 26, 2018.\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 John B Denton, Wikipedia.org, accessed September 26, 2018.\n\n↑ U.S. Territorial Papers, Vol. 19, p. 17.\n\n↑ John B.
