David was born in Acol, Isle of Thanet, Kent. In 1871, when David was 20 years old, he was unmarried, a farm servant, and lived with Thomas and Ann Sellerfield at Acol. Thomas Sellerfield was also a farm servant. David was a farm labourer and kept sheep. He had a beard. His first marriage ended after seven years when his first wife died - they had no children. On the 1881 Census for Acol, David is entered as a widower living with his mother, Harriet Gore, a widow. David Gore married Anne Jane Beer on the 6th October, 1881, at the Wesleyan Chapel, High Street, Minster, Thanet. This Chapel is built of red brick with a porch in front, and at the end of the 20th Century was still being used by the Methodists. Annie was 23 years old and David was 30 years. They both lived at Acol, Nr. Birchington, Kent, at the time of their marriage.\n\nANNIE GORE (1.1.1858-15.4.1939). Parents John and Martha Beer (formerly Giles). Ann Jane Beer was born on the 1st January 1858, in Beltinge, Herne, Nr. Canterbury, Kent. Her father at the time was a waggoner, but later in life was a farm labourer. He was illiterate. At the time of the 1881 Census, which was held on the 3rd April, Annie Beer was living at the home of James R. Ray, an Australian Methodist, in Devonshire Road, Lewisham, Kent, as a domestic servant. In a large guilded Victorian edition of John Bunyan which came from the home of Annie Gore, she had written her maiden name Annie Beer and the date May 1881 all entwined with flowers upside down on one of the back fly leafs.\n\nThe family first lived at Acol, Nr. Minster, Thanet, Kent, a long scattered hamlet at least until 1886.\n\nDuring the period 1886-1889 the family moved from Acol to Ringwould, Nr. Dover, where they lived in the Village Street. David Gore's occupation was then a farm bailiff. The village of Ringwould stands high on the Dover-Deal Road. Ringwould commands magnificent views over the adjoining countryside and over the sea. Its church has for centuries been a landmark for mariners. The ancient butts, originally the practice ground for the village archers, are now the playground for the school children. There is also a windmill. The public house is called the Five Bells, and the names of the Village lanes are Front Lane, Back Lane and Hangman's Lane. Ann and David were invited to a Dinner to celebrate Queen Victoria's Jubilee on the 1st July 1897 by John Henry Monins, a local landowner, whose daughter later married Lord Broome of the Kitchener Family. The Monins family came over with William the Conqueror and at one time owned Saltwood Castle. The Monins described David Gore as one of Nature's Gentlemen and too honest. There was another farmer in Ringwould who was more prosperous because he was less conscientious, and as a result David's farm suffered. David Gore taught the infants in the Sunday School at Ringwould St. Nicholas C.of E. Church for 13 years. David Gore was a Methodist, but was confirmed into the Church of England at Ringwould on the 17th February 1894, at the age of 43 years. On Sundays the family used to go to C of E church in the morning, Sunday School in the afternoon and Wesleyan Chapel in the evening, which was built in 1866 and nicknamed the cathedral. In the guilded John Bunyan book a small card was found detailing a Resolution to avoid sin and lead the life of a true servant of Jesus Christ, made at the Mission held in Ringwould on October 19th 1890.\n\nIn August 1903, the family moved to Lydden (halfway between Dover and Canterbury), where they lived at Lydden Court Cottages, Lydden Lane. David worked as a farm labourer on Lydden Farm opposite where he lived, which was owned by two old ladies called the Miss Broadley's. Their farmhouse is next to the Church at the top end of Lydden Lane, and at the bottom of the lane is the Bell Public House. Lydden, cupped in a hollow at the foot of a hill, on the Dover-Canterbury Road, is a picturesque little village. Coal was mined there, the first in Kent, early in the 20th Century. The surrounding country is very beautiful and from the crest of a hill to the Northeast there is a lovely view of Calais harbour and the French coast. The ancient church, of pre-Norman origin, is a perfect specimen of the early undecorated style and has a Leper squint.\n\nAnnie always used to enjoy a glass of stout after doing the washing, and used to send one of the children to The Bell with a jug to fetch it. She also kept chickens. David died on the 4th April 1911, from cancer of the prostate and exhaustion, after a very short and painful illness. He was 60 years, and is buried in the churchyard of St. Mary the Virgin Parish Church, Lydden. His grave is not far from the front entrance and the inscription on his grave reads In loving memory of David Gore who entered into rest April 4th 1911 aged 60 yrs. There remanneth therefore a rest to the people of God. Also of David, son of the above, interred at Ringwould 1892 age 6 yrs. Jesus called a little child. This tombstone broke and fell over in 1996, and was placed against the wall of the Churchyard.\n\nAnn was left a widow at the age of 53 years. The family for a while lived at 9 Wyndham Road, Tower Hamlets, Dover, the same address as Martha Beer, Annie's Mother. It is probable that Annie went into service for short periods at this time, which she found very exhausting. In 1912 they all moved to 6 Glebe Road, Carlinge, Nr. Birchington, Kent, a small terraced house. Birchington is situated on the North Kent coast at the point where the white cliffs begin their run to Dover, facing the Thames and the North Sea. This was rented accommodation, and the family remained there until Winnie died in 1984. Annie also took in summer guests and they were always the same families. One of the families were the Brendons' who were cousins of the Brendon family that Rosina was children's nurse to. Annie used to collect postcards. She always wore her black mourning clothes and used an ear trumpet. She also used to take home any newspapers she found to use as firelighters. She died in 1939 aged 81 years and is buried in St. John's Cemetery, Manston Road, Margate. After Annie died the lodge at the rear of the house in Garlinge was turned into a bathroom.\n\nThere are two large burial plots in St. John's Cemetery, Margate, where Martha Beer, Annie, Arthur, Rosie and Winnie are buried, but they are unmarked.\n\nAnnie and David had six children\n\n(1) Rosina Anne (16.7.1882 - 18.12.1971). Rosina was born in Acol. Rosie never married. She was a children's nurse. Up until about 1912 she worked for a family in Canterbury. In April, 1911, her address was Pivington, Old Dover Road, Canterbury. After that time she worked for a family at St. Johns Vicarage, Maidstone. She did alot of needlework and fine crochet work. The families Rosina worked for often went on long holidays in England, when Rosie would accompany them. By 193? Rosie returned home to live at 9 Glebe Road, Garlinge, to look after her mother. Rosina has been described as being rather prim. Rosie died very quickly - she was sitting in a chair waiting for her sister Winnie to make a cup of tea, and when Winnie came to give her the cup of tea she found she had died. Rosie was 89 years old, and is buried in St. John's Cemetery, Manston Road, Margate.\n\n(2) Arthur William (12.2.1884 - 19.10.1967). Arthur was born in Acol. He always jokingly said that he was the black sheep of the family and that his father favoured his sisters. Arthur was a member of the Church of England Temperance Society which was based in Canterbury, and one of their objectives was to provide the spiritual and temporal wants of the Cockney hop-pickers by visiting them in their huts to discuss their morals. As a very young man he first worked and lived in Ringwould, Nr. Dover. In September 1914 he joined Kitchener's Army - the 8th Buffs, Royal East Kent Regiment, at Canterbury, - Private A. Gore, Service No. G/2472, to fight in World War I. He arrived in France on the 31st August 1915. The 8th Battalion of the Buffs, under Colonel Romer, spent two days at Boulogne before going into billets at Maninghem, or. Etaples, remaining there for two weeks completing divisional training. On the 21st September they started to march to Bethune, a very trying journey mostly done by night over bad roads. On the second night 22 miles were covered. Bethune was reached in the very early morning of the 25th September, where they formed part of the 72nd Brigade commanded by Br. General B.M. Mitford, part of the concentration prior to the Battle of Loos. At 11 am on the day of arrival at Bethune, the battalion formed up and Colonel Romer addressed his men I am not going to make a speech to you, hut only to ask you to remember that you are 'The Buffs' . The battalion then moved forward towards the fighting line, gradually approaching Vermelles. They were ordered that night to attack Hulluch, but this was cancelled to allow artillery preparation. The battalion got into what were the original German second-line trenches and remained there till Ii am on the 26th September. At 10.30 am orders came for the division to attack at 11 am, when the 8th Buffs went over the top to take part in the Battle of Loos, without having gone through the apprenticeship and instruction under fire in the trenches, which was the rule in all cases of fresh troops arriving in the country. They advanced under steady and persistent shelling to the German fortifications east of Hulluch. At 11.55 the order came to withdraw and from that moment the hostile fire, especially from the left flank, became hotter and the casualties heavier. The Buffs casualties were tremendous, amounting to 24 officers and 610 other ranks. When night came parties were sent out to remove the killed and wounded, but because the Germans had re-occupied their old trenches along the Hulluch-Lens Road the rescue parties failed to get at the eastern slope of the valley on which Hulluch lies, and only a dozen or so of the more lightly wounded of the Buffs managed to crawl back after nightfall. What was left of the 8th Buffs were relieved during the night of the 26th/27th September. The attack drew off 16 battalions of the enemy, allowing the capture of Souchey and 14,000 prisoners. The 8th Buffs spent the rest of the War on trench duty. Arthur was captured at Vermelles and by the 21st November, 1915, was being kept prisoner at Kriegs-Gefangenen-Lager Munster II, Germany. His legs were injured by shrapnel. He returned to England on the 22nd November, 1918, arriving at Hull on the SS Porto. On the 20th March, 1919, Arthur was discharged to Class Z Army Reserve. He married Jenny Roberts later in his life, when he was about 40 years of age, and they never had any children. They lived at Bridge House, Pennington Walk, Retford, Nottinghamshire. Arthur worked in a rubber factory, and Jenny worked in a shop. After his wife died one of Arthur's legs became so bad that he had to have it amputated. The nurse who looked after him moved into his house to look after him. Eventually she married, and she and her husband carried on living in Arthur's house. Their first child used to call Arthur Cramps. After their second baby was born, however, she found she could no longer cope with Arthur, as by then he was older and becoming a bit of a handful. She got in touch with Arthur's sisters, Rosie and Winnie, at 6 Glebe Road, Garlinge, and arranged for him to live with them. Rosie and Winnie used to have long summer holidays at the Falkham Hotel in Bude, Cornwall, which was owned by one of Rosie's ex-employers, and while they were away Arthur used to stay with Norah's daughter Daisy, which could be a couple of months or so. Daisy's young sons used to hate it, because by then he ate a bit untidily. He lived until he was 83 years. Arthur is buried in St. John's Cemetery, Manston Road, Margate. (Arthur used to speak about an Uncle of his who had quarelled with his Grandmother, and went to Australia, and ended up owning lots of land out there).\n\n(3) David (1.1.1886 - 26.11.1892). David was born in Acol but died inRingwould, Nr. Dover, aged six years from Scarlatina Maligna.(According to Evelyn Gore, he died from dipheria). He is buried in Ringwould Churchyard, Nr. Dover.\n\n(4) Norah Jane (3.4.1890 - 16.3.1986). Norah was born in Ringwould. Norah worked for a family at Deal, and at Coxhill, Shepherds Well, Nr. Dover, as a nanny. Norah married Ernest Friend on the 15th July, 1911, and they had 5 children. (See separate text). She was always fond of her clothes and never felt dressed without a necklace on. Norah had a large non-malignant growth on her forehead, and when it was removed a tooth was found inside. She was 96 years old when she died.\n\n(5) Evelyn Mary (b 24.1.1893 d. 22.10.1972). Evelyn was born at Ringwauld. At school one day she was told off for slouching, and the following day told off for walking unnaturally, because she was trying to keep a straight back. Evelyn used to walk in her sleep as a child, on two occasions, when the family were living in Lydden, she actually left the house, one time being rescued from the side of the pond on the other side of the road from the Bell P.H., and the other occasion she startled another household by knocking on their door. She left home in 1907 at the age of 15 to work as a nanny for a family called Coring at Pontybat, Brecon, South Wales. The children were called Molly and Joan. There was also a family named Goring in Lydden, and there must have been some connection. While in Wales Evelyn gave a young boy 10 pence to teach her the Welsh National Anthem - in Welsh. She returned to Kent in 1911, when her father died. After that she lived for a while at 3 Tontine Street, Folkestone. Did she work there as well? In September 1913, Evelyn moved to 7 Adrian Street, Dover. Her mother at the time was living in Tower Hamlets, Dover. Evelyn married Leonard Godden on the 18th October 1913 in Dover Registry Office and they lived in Denton, Nr. Canterbury, and had 3 children (see separate Text). She lived until she was 79 years old and is buried in Denton Churchyard, Nr. Canterbury.\n\n(6) Winifred (b. 6.11.1896. d. 22.10.1984). Winnie was born at Ringwould. Winnie worked and lived at the School House, Dover College, Dover, Kent. In the 1st World War she joined the WAAF, and her address in 1917 was RA & RE Brick Town, Lydd Camp, Romney Marsh, Kent. Winnie never married. When she retired she lived at 9 Glebe Road, Garlinge with her sister Rosie. After Rosie died in 1971, Winnie lived there on her own for the next 13 years, and her niece Norah Godden regularly had her to stay at her home in Denton, as she was getting a little confused. Winnie developed tunnel vision when she got older. Winnie died on the 22nd October, 1984, aged 87 years, at Haine Hospital, Ramsgate, and is buried in St. John's Cemetery, Manston Road, Margate.\n\n26th June 1996\n\nPatricia payne\n\n5\n\nDavid married Anne Jane Beer [6086] [MRIN: 3993], daughter of John Beer [5737] and Martha Giles [6084], on 6 Oct 1881 in Wesleyan Chapel, Minster In Thanet, Kent.33 (Anne Jane Beer [6086] was born on 1 Jan 1858 in Herne, Kent 130, christened on 7 Feb 1858 in Herne, Kent 33 and died on 15 Apr 1939 33.)\n\nMarriage Notes:"
