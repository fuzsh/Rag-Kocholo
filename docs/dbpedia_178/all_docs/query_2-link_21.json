At the age of 12, he ran away to work as a deckhand on an Arkansas River flatboat.[4]\n\nAbout 1825, he underwent a conversion and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. For ten years served in Arkansas and southern Missouri as an itinerant minister.[4]\n\nClark County, Arkansas, 1830 census:[6]\n\nDenton, John\n\nMales\n\nunder 5 = 1\n\n20-29 = 1\n\nFemales\n\nunder 5 = 2\n\n20-29 = 1\n\nIn Jan 1836, Denton crossed the Red River into Texas with Littleton Fowler (also a preacher) and settled in Red River County. Because the money he earned as a preacher was inadequate to support his family, he undertook the study of law in 1838. Six months later he was licensed to practice and went into partnership with John B. Craig at Clarksville.[4]\n\nBy 1840, he was captain of a militia company under Col. Edward Tarrant. On 24 May, he was killed by Indians on Village Creek in northeast Tarrant County while on a scouting expedition with Henry Stout.[2][4]\n\nHis body originally was buried in an unmarked grave near the confluence of Oliver Creek & Denton Creek. According to some accounts, about 30 years later, Stout was able to relocate Denton's grave, and the remains were reburied by John S. Chisum in a wooden box in the corner of the yard of his home on Clear Creek, near Bolivar. In 1901, the Pioneer Association of Denton County, after diligent search and thorough identification, again removed the remains and buried them with appropriate ceremonies in the southeast corner of the Denton County Courthouse lawn.[2][4]\n\nReferences"
