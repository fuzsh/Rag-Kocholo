To support his family he also became a lawyer and practiced law in Clarksville and like other men at the time he joined the military when he was needed. On May 22, 1841 he accompanied Col. Edward H. Tarrant and other men in his company at the battle of Village Creek, a fight between the settlers and Indians near present day Fort Worth.

Today Denton is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States.\n\t\n\tThe 1896 courthouse still stands, known as the Denton County Courthouse-on-the-Square. It holds some county offices and a museum. Several blocks away you will find the current courthouse (above), known as the Denton County Courts Building, built in 1998.",
