In a few days the little sore place became infected, became red, painful and swollen. The infection spread rapidly, developing into pneumonia. And death resulted.\n\nTularama, or rabbit fever, was not know until recently. It was discovered in California, but has spread pretty well over the country. Not all rabbits or squirrels are effected. But many are. It is a germ disease, and thorough cooking kills the germs. So there is no danger in eating rabbit or squirrel that has been well cooked. But it is dangerous to get the raw blood on the hands, especially if there is a broken place in the skin. The only safe way to handle or dress rabbit, is to weat good rubber gloves, and wash them clean after use.\n\nBALL, Edward Ben The Pulaski Citizen 19 Aug 1970\n\nEdward Ben Ball, 67, died Tuesday night, August 11, in Giles County Hospital.
