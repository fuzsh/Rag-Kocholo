        "text": "Kirby Clawson, 89, of Plains, KS, passed away Friday morning, March 1, 2024, of congestive heart failure, at St. Catherine Hospital in Dodge City, KS, with his children gathered around. Kirby stayed active until the end, coming into the office Tuesday and still visiting about history and business with family members on Thursday night.\n\nKirby, the fourth of eight children, was born to C. H. “Dutch” and Bernice Pauline (Beaver) Clawson in the family home on the prairie, three miles east of Hitchland, Texas, on March 21, 1934. Kirby grew up riding a horse to attend a one-room schoolhouse in Hitchland as a child during the days of the Dust Bowl and Depression. In 1948, the family moved to a farm five miles west of Gruver where Kirby attended and graduated from high school in 1952. Kirby didn’t stray far from home when he attended Panhandle A & M College at Goodwell, OK, where he was active in ROTC, the photography club, the museum club, and the yearly cattle auction that continues to this day. Kirby took a mandatory art appreciation course there which seeded his love for art that continued throughout his life. Kirby was also on the livestock judging team and graduated with a B.S. in Animal Husbandry in 1956.\n\nAfter graduation, Kirby farmed, ranched, and continued to help his father at the Stateline Grain Company in Hitchland. On March 19,1960, Kirby married a lovely Kansas girl, Mary Collingwood, who had been teaching school in Liberal, KS. After marriage, they made their home in Hitchland, TX. On April 1, 1962, Kirby and Mary moved to the farm northwest of Satanta, KS, where they spent nearly 50 years raising crops, cattle, and their six children.\n\nKirby gave his life to Jesus Christ in the 5th grade. When the preacher gave the altar call, Kirby went up with a cousin and a neighbor. The other two boys who answered that altar call became life-long pastors.\n\nKirby was a humorous storyteller and shared interesting facts about his life. A couple of his favorite stories while growing up in Hitchland follow:\n\n“We had running water growing up. We took the bucket and ran it from the windmill to the house!”\n\n“Dad would always pull me out of the one room school to move cattle. I asked him once why he didn’t pick any of my other brothers. He told me it was because I would never get behind in my class. I was the only one in my class!”\n\nKirby loved the challenge of farming, looking after the land, and improving and making the land more productive. Kirby helped many young men get started in the farming business by renting them ground and offering them advice over the years. Kirby was also blessed to be able to hire some good friends to help in many different capacities. He and his family are very grateful for all these relationships and the positive things that resulted from the expertise and hard work of many people.\n\nKirby served as a member and officer of the Southwest Kansas Irrigation Association, was a director of the REA Board, a member of the Satanta Chamber of Commerce, the Satanta School Board, and was one of the original Ground Water Management #3 Board members. Kirby served on the board of the Collingwood Grain Company for twenty years and as Chairman of the Board of The Plains State Bank (now Bank of the Plains) from 1977 until the early 2000’s. Kirby was a partner in the High Plains Ponderosa Dairy for the past two decades. God blessed Kirby with a mind for business and an incredible memory for recalling details.\n\nKirby shared his business knowledge, passion for good cattle, and farming expertise with his children. He began turning over the reins of the businesses to them thirty years ago as he stepped into a guiding and nurturing role – encouraging them to start new ventures and learn from their successes, as well as their failures.\n\nKirby was a life-long supporter of the 4-H and FFA programs in Haskell and Meade counties and was active in the Methodist Churches at both Satanta, KS, and later at Plains, KS where he loved bringing bananas for Sunday fellowship time. Kirby became known around Meade and Haskell counties as the doughnut man, bringing boxes of doughnuts to share at the coffee shops, cattle brandings, 4-H events, and his grandchildren’s sports events for many years. Family members will remember his many homemade breakfasts, which included: cheesy eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, and blueberry pancakes.\n\nIn 2010, Kirby and Mary moved to Plains, KS, where Kirby spent most of his days sharing his wisdom and his humor with his children, grandchildren, and anyone who visited. People often came to the Clawson Office to seek him out for his advice.\n\nKirby was preceded in death by his wife Mary Ruth, son Andrew Jerome Clawson, granddaughter Heidi Grace Clawson, great-grandson Wesley Kade Klahr, his parents, three brothers, Max, Rodney, and Chuck, and one sister, Wanda Stevens.\n\nHe is survived by his children: Marilyn (Greg) Giles, Dan (Tamra) Clawson, David (Jeanne) Clawson, Kenby (Lana) Clawson, and Mary Beth (Brent) Woods. Nineteen grandchildren: Abby Giles, Betsy Giles, Matthew (Tami) Giles, and Josiah Giles; Cooper (Leah) Clawson, Jacqueline (Dean) Klahr, Walker (Laura) Clawson, Gatlin Clawson, and Korben Clawson; Layne (Rachel) Clawson, Ann Clawson, and Carl Clawson; Kyla (Brady) Larson, Kendal (Caroline) Clawson, Kurtis (Paige) Clawson, and Kathryn (Corey) Spraggins; Adeline Woods, Emmett Woods, and Audy Woods; and 14 great-grandchildren with three more on the way in the next few months. Kirby is also survived by his sisters: Ella Mae Clawson, Margaret Bell, Karen (Bill) Seyb and sister-in-law Jo Alice Clawson, and a host of other relatives and friends.\n\nKirby was really looking forward to visiting with all of his family and friends at his 90th birthday party later this month, but what a wonderful Heavenly Birthday he is celebrating instead.\n\nA celebration of life service will be held at the Plains Methodist Church at 10:30 am on Friday, March 8, 2024. After the service, the family welcomes everyone to a catered meal. The family would love to greet you there. Burial will follow at 2:30 p.m. at the Dudley Township Cemetery, Satanta, KS. Friends may call from 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m. with the family present from 5:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. Thursday, March 7, 2024, at Fidler-Orme-Bachman Mortuary, Meade, KS.\n\nThe family welcomes memorials to the Plains Methodist Church or to the charity of the donor’s choice in care of the funeral home.\n\nBeverly Faye Merkle Rogers, age 85, passed away Saturday evening, January 13, 2024, at the Medical Lodge of Goddard, Goddard, KS.\n\nShe was born February 13, 1938, at Meade, Kansas, the daughter and only child of Chas and Hazel (Kintner) Merkle. She attended school in Meade, graduating from Meade High School in 1956. Following graduation, she attended Dodge City Community College and the Venus Beauty Academy in Wichita. Many years later, she attended and graduated Friends University, graduating with a Master’s degree in Management in 2002. She was a lifelong resident of Meade County.\n\nShe was a licensed and practicing cosmetologist for many years, running Candlelight Curl in Meade. She also waitressed at Toni’s Café and managed Hazel’s Café in Meade. However, it would always be the stocking and management of the Bar M and X7 Cattle Ranches in both Kansas and Missouri with her father that she was most passionate about. She would continue to run the cattle operation for over 20 years following her father’s passing in 1977. She loved it when those baby calves were dropping with a good mama cow taking care of them and she always hated to see them loaded out on a trailer.\n\nShe was an active member of the Meade Saddle Club during its existence and always spoke of those years as the best time of her life. She won multiple individual and team awards running barrels, poles, kegs, and relay races. She enjoyed everything outdoors that had to do with animals and their care. She was involved in Meade County 4-H as a project leader and was involved in her children’s activities in school. She particularly enjoyed and spent countless hours cobbling things together to suit her immediate purpose. She did some just amazing, some might even say unbelievable, things with baling wire, twine, hot wires, tarps, and grain sacks.\n\nOn December 23, 1967, she married William N. Rogers at Manhattan, Kansas. He preceded her in death on September 8, 2020. She was preceded in death by her parents and a daughter, Tonya Faye Rogers, on August 23, 1968. She would really want everyone to know here that she is also preceded in death by a lot of her old Saddle Club buddies, several really good horses that she was so proud of, dogs and cats, and a lot of other critters, both big and small, that she did her best to take care of.\n\nOther survivors include a daughter Katherine (Kit) Rogers of Wichita, Kansas; two sons, Duke and Chas Rogers both of Wichita. She enjoyed spending time with family and friends, but there was usually an animal somewhere in the picture as well.\n\nGraveside services will be held at 3:00 p.m. Saturday, January 20, 2024, at Graceland Cemetery, Meade. Friends may call from 12:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m. with the family present at Fidler-Orme-Bachman Mortuary, Meade.\n\nThe family would welcome memorials to the Meade County Fair or the Meade Food Bank in care of the funeral home.\n\nMerl Dean “Buck” Rexford (80) passed away in the early morning of January 4, 2024 at Stormont Vail Hospital in Topeka, KS, surrounded by his family.\n\nHe was born on April 9, 1943 to Alva and Dorothy (Wilson) Rexford in Dodge City, KS. His parents preceded him in death.\n\nHe attended Meade Schools until graduation in 1961. He then attended the Kansas University School of Engineering for 3 ½ years before he was drafted to Vietnam. He proudly served his country in the Army 4th Infantry Division Charlie Company unit where many lifelong friends were made. When he returned from the war he went to work for his father on the family farm and dedicated his life to the land. He then later took over the family farm and worked hard to build his own additions to the farm and added 2 ranches. He worked with John Deere and Pioneer Seed to develop innovative equipment, technology, and products.\n\nHe placed 1st in the State of Kansas National Corn Growers Association National Corn Yield Contest multiple years. He placed 3rd in the National Corn Growers Association 2009 National Corn Yield Contest. He also won the 2020 People’s Choice and Promoter’s Choice awards for his prize1956 Corvette he had restored.\n\nOn December 15, 1979 he married his current wife Marilyn (Brehm) in Dodge City, KS with their beloved grandmothers there to give them away. Together they enjoyed fast cars, traveling, attending concerts, and bowling. He loved his coffee groups and time with family and friends.

Ron loved his family fiercely and cherished his friendships made through the years.\n\nRon was born May 24, 1941 in Meade, Kansas to Kenneth “Pink” and Velma Pemberton. He developed his love of animals on their family farm. Ron’s favorite story to tell his children when they were learning to drive was how much the owners of the local filling station liked him because he was one of the only teenagers that would not kick rocks when he pulled out of the station. Ron continued to live his life with a respect for others and property.\n\nRon graduated from Kansas State University with a degree in Pre-Veterinary Studies. Spurred by his love for animals, sharp mind and good friends, Ron graduated from Kansas State Veterinary School in 1967.\n\nRon met his soul mate at K-State. Jane had self-appointed herself to be a greeter to students and when she met Ron, her lifelong friend told her that she was going to marry him someday. That “someday” turned into June 25, 1966 when the couple were wed in Salina, KS. They recently celebrated their 57th year of marriage. Ron and Jane were blessed with two children – John (son) and Jenn (daughter).\n\nUpon graduation from Veterinary school, Ron spent two years in the United States Air Force as an Air Force Veterinarian in Wichita Falls, TX and Big Spring, TX. Ron then began his career as a private practicing veterinarian working for Vet clinics and finally working for himself at his own Vet Clinic. While he worked on all animals, Ron specialized in large animals – horses and cattle. The Pemberton family lived in Ardmore, OK, Hot Springs, AR and Grapevine, TX before settling in Roswell, NM. It was in Roswell, NM that Ron started his job with the United States Department of Agriculture as a federal veterinarian. Ron worked alongside many people he called his friends to keep Brucellosis and Tuberculosis out of the cattle herds. Ron was known by many as a veterinarian that was fair but took his job very seriously. He was responsible for a six County area but was also frequently called into other parts of the United States to keep foreign diseases out of the country.\n\nRon loved wood working, puzzles, reading and supporting his family. He often had projects that he made in his home shop, Sawdust Station, and gave them away as gifts to family and friends. He made everything from statement pieces of a child’s rocking chair to household decorations to pens. Whenever you were gifted with one of Ron’s projects, you felt an honor of the time he spent making it and his talent to create beautiful pieces. He was often called upon for his knowledge of fixing things, healing animals and life advice.\n\nRon is survived by his wife, Jane Martin Pemberton; children, John (Lori) Pemberton, Jenn (Jason) Sanders; grandchildren, Carter Sanders, Sophia Pemberton, Grace Ruiz and Kato Ruiz; sister Sandi Ergott whom he affectionally called “Briar”; brothers-in-law Harvey (Sherry) Martin, John (Lisa) Martin and Tom (Teresa) Martin; 8 nieces and nephews, lots of grand-nieces and -nephews, a few great-grand nieces and nephews and many good, lifelong friends.\n\nRon was preceded in death by his parents, Kenneth and Velma Pemberton.\n\nRon will be remembered for his smile, friendly personality, quick wit, love of his family and sayings such as “Peachy Keen” and “Finer than Frog’s Hair” when asked how he was doing. His absence will leave a large hole in many hearts but we are all better for our time spent with this wonderful son, husband, father, Papa, brother and friend to many.\n\nA Celebration of Life was held at the First United Methodist Church on Thursday, October 26th at 10:30am. The Family hosted a Private Burial at Oaklawn Cemetery.\n\nIf desired, memorials may be made to the First United Methodist Church in Decatur and the Wise County Animal Shelter.\n\nMargaret (Mudgie) Lucille (Dewell) Eaton passed away peacefully, surrounded by her children on June 22, 2023, from complications of pneumonia. She was 103 years old.\n\nMudgie was born on Nov. 25th, 1919, to Ralph and Dorothy Dewell in Fowler, KS. She was the 2nd oldest of 10 siblings. When she was in the 5th grade, her family moved to a farm in Pritchett, CO. When she was a sophomore, she moved back to Fowler, KS and graduated from Fowler High School in 1937.\n\nIn 1938, she enrolled in St. Anthony’s Hospital School of Nursing in Dodge City, KS and received her “RN” in 1941.

She was an avid fan of the KC Chiefs, KU Jayhawks and the Fowler Goldbugs.\n\nMudgie was preceded in death by her parents, her husband Jim (2001), and 6 of her siblings: Mary, Bill, Lyman, Alden (Duke), Hal, and Jimmy. She is survived by one brother, Ray, and two sisters, Marceline Hoffman and Pat Fisher. She also leaves a daughter, Kathie Brizendine (Tom) of Lee’s Summit, MO, and sons Robb Eaton (Lisa) of Lenexa, KS, and Kim Eaton (Cynthia) of Grandview, MO, as well as 7 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nMudgie was known for her deep faith in the Lord. She was baptized in Christ on April 6th, 1947 at the Christian Church in Fowler, KS. Since then she has been a faithful servant and lover of God. Her Bible was tattered, well-worn, underlined and written all over. She demonstrated her love for the Lord in the ways she served others – hosting Bible studies, visiting people in the hospital, cooking meals, sending support for widows/those in prison, sharing her faith, etc. The list goes on and on! She could hardly wait to see her Savior’s face. Today she’s enjoying the Holy Presence of the Lover of her soul!\n\nThe family requests in lieu of flowers that donations be made in memory of Mudgie to her home church, Foundry Church, 8835 Lackman Rd., Lenexa, KS 66219, in c/o FORGE Scholarships, a scholarship program for young people who wish to go into Christian Ministry.

Mae, the daughter of Joseph and Walburga Robben Baalman, was born in Oakley, Kansas. As a child, Mae lived in Wellington, Winfield, and Oxford, KS. She and her sister, Jeanie, lacking funds to purchase store-bought toys but having abundant imagination, made mud pies, built playhouses, made paper dolls from magazines and built high-heeled shoes from wood scraps. When Mae was 11 years old, they moved to Dodge City. She was a fun-loving teenager, who enjoyed speech and plays and driving the teachers crazy. She graduated from St. Mary’s of the Plains Highs School in 1953. Immediately after graduation, she began working as a bookkeeper at Southwest Oil and Supply. Mae briefly left Dodge City to live with Jeanie and her husband, Cap in Dearborn, Michigan, before returning to Dodge City. In 1957, she began dating Cap’s brother, Gerald Jacobs. She moved to Liberal, Kansas, to be closer to Gerald and worked as a bookkeeper at Doll Motor Co. The two were married August 30, 1958. They made their home on the farm in Plains, where they raised four children.\n\nMae dedicated the rest of her life to being a meticulous homemaker, which coined her the nickname “Mrs. Clean.” She prepared meals daily and often delivered them to the field. She was the financial manager of the family farm, along with driving grain trucks during harvest. She was an active member of the Altar Society at their church. A dedicated mother and grandmother, she enjoyed attending their many activities. In 1993, Gerald and Mae retired and moved to Dodge City. This allowed her to pursue her hobbies: antiques, shopping, reading, gambling, and collecting everything – especially Beanie Babies. In 2021, when her health declined, she moved to Wichita to be near her daughter, Dana.\n\nMae is survived by her four children: Lori Fleming and husband Rich of Copeland, KS; Rhonda Cook and husband Dave of Parker, AZ; Shawn Jacobs and wife Kathy of Plains; and Dana Handy and husband Jerrod of Wichita; her 10 grandchildren: Cami Faust and husband Mike of Houston, TX; Brendon Cook and wife April of Flagstaff, AZ; Taly Thiessen and husband Mark of Houston, TX; Savannah Downing and husband Marc of Ellis, KS; Brandi Gomez and husband John of Lake Havasu City, AZ; Rani Simon and husband Bryce of Lakin, KS; Deni Thill and husband Nolan of Garden City, KS; Rebi Ross and husband Kelby of Plains; Daley Handy and fiancé, Justin Mann, of Independence, KS; and Jacey Handy of Wichita; 21 great-grandchildren and one sibling: Lois Gish of Lake Elsinore, CA.

Her growing up years were spent in Oroville, CA. A few days after Betty’s eleventh birthday, her mother passed away, leaving Betty and her siblings forced to grow up faster than normal. Her Aunt Edna was a great blessing during these years, providing the stability needed. Betty’s father, whom she loved dearly, was a pastor, evangelist, and missionary in the Church of the Nazarene, traveling much of the time in itinerant ministry.\n\nDuring her youth, Betty and her family picked prunes one summer. She cleaned houses, helped out in the garden, and did what she could to earn money. Her family would have been considered poor by world standards, but they were rich in love and spiritual growth. During World War II, Betty, age 18, worked in the shipyards, delivering messages by motor scooter where needed.\n\nOn June 12, 1946, Betty graduated from Richmond Union High School in Richmond, California; the day before her 19th birthday; the day after, she married the love of her life, Sidney E. Jackson, in Richmond, California. She met Sid upon his discharge from the Army following World War II. They fell in love and with Sid’s call to pastor, Betty was determined to be a helpmate and support to him in ministry. He enrolled in Pasadena College in the fall of 1947, majoring in Religion and determined to preach the gospel. The happy couple lived on trailer row with many other newly married veterans. In their second year of marriage, they rode a motorcycle to Canada and back, encountering many delightful as well as hair raising experiences on that trip. While still in college, they began to supply pastor in Crestline, a small church up in the mountains close to Pasadena.\n\nWith Sid’s college graduation in 1951, the couple began a lifelong ministry, pastoring mainly in California, but also in Nevada, Iowa, Saskatchewan, and Nebraska.\n\nTo their union were born two sons, Paul Edward Jackson,1948, and John Robert Jackson, 1954. Both sons followed in their father’s and grandfather’s footsteps in ministry in the Church of the Nazarene, John as a youth leader and Paul as a song evangelist. The boys loved to sing together and would occasionally get Betty to join them in giving a “Tarzan yell “ in trio. In 1967, Paul was in a terrible motorcycle accident in his senior year of high school. In 1988, John, in his first years of ministry, suddenly went to be with Jesus. Both experiences were hard to live through, but Betty was conscious of the never failing strength and peace God gave her.\n\nBetty described herself as a “handmaid of the Lord, and a helpmate” for her husband—whatever Sid needed her to do, she did with God’s help. Through the years, she taught Sunday School for various age levels, sang specials, helped with the Nazarene missions program, entertained in the parsonage, worked as a camp counselor, and raised two wonderful boys to serve Jesus wholeheartedly.\n\nIn 1997, Betty & Sid moved to Meade, KS to be close to their son and daughter-in-love, Paul & Trish Jackson. They were an encouragement to the Meade community, socializing at the BEAM Center, picking up trash on the streets around the community, and loving on their Meade Nazarene church family.\n\nLate in 2007, Betty’s oldest son, Paul, was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, and passed away in 2009, after a lengthy battle. Betty was thankful she was there to support Paul & Trish during this time in their lives.\n\nIn her spare time, Betty loved to sew quilts and design clothing out of whatever she had on hand. She also spent much time reading God’s Word and other inspirational books. It was a great sorrow to her when she could no longer see well enough to do those things due to advancing macular degeneration.\n\nSid passed away in 2012, leaving Betty and his small dog, “Mitzi.” Although Betty had not been crazy about having another dog when Sid brought it home several years earlier, she came to depend on Mitzi to be her eyes and ears during the last several years. Mitzi was a faithful companion until she died of old age shortly before Betty’s 94th birthday.\n\nWith Sid’s passing, it seemed that Betty “came out of her shell,” loving on people wherever she found them. She was no longer able to get out and about, so she relied on the Lord to bring people to her and never failed to give a witness for the Lord and His soon return. She continued to attend church as she was able and had a testimony and a loving hug for everyone she met there. Folks were used to her getting right in their faces to ask, “Now, who are you???” and “What’s that, you say?” Macular degeneration and loss of hearing did not keep her from getting acquainted and encouraging those around her.\n\nAfter a bout with COVID-19, she entered the Fowler Residential Care facility in January of 2022, continuing to be a blessing to those around her. In her final days, her greatest desire was to be with Jesus and to take as many with her as she could.\n\nBetty was a member of the Church of the Nazarene and the Family Alliance for Christian Temperance. Her testimony in a nutshell would be: Don’t put off turning your life over to Jesus and trusting in Him. He has supplied every need and more. He is sufficient for this life and the one to come.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, Betty passed from this world into the loving arms of her Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ. She was preceded in death by her parents, Roland and Elsie Griffith, husband, Sidney Jackson, sons, Paul and John Jackson, sisters, Roberta Griffith Wiseman, Ann Griffith, Kay Adcock, and brothers-in-law, Keith Wiseman and Les Adcock. She leaves behind her daughter-in-love, Trish Jackson Reimer, a brother, Rolland Griffith (Donna) of Medford, OR, a half-sister, Connie Patrick (Bill), Hermitage, TN, two grandchildren, Gloria Custes (Jay) and Bart Marshall (Tiffany) of Louisville, KY, eleven great grandchildren, and a host of friends and extended family. Her winsome smile and her sharp witticisms will be greatly missed by all.\n\nA Memorial service will be held at the Meade Church of the Nazarene at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, May 22, 2023. Inurnment will follow in Graceland Cemetery, Meade, KS. Memorials may be given to Nazarene Missions International (NMI) in care of Meade Church of the Nazarene for use in building churches.\n\nEunice Amanda Friesen, 96, died April 24, 2023 at Fowler Residential Care (Fowler, Kansas), her home for the past two-and-a-half years. She was born to Cornelius K. and Anna Suderman Brandt on September 14, 1926, in Reedley, California. She grew up on a small farm outside of Reedley with her two sisters, near her beloved Suderman cousins. The vineyards and orchards of her youth near Reedley were the source of many legendary stories of fun and adventure told by her and her sisters.\n\nFollowing her graduation from high school, Eunice enrolled in Reedley College for nurses training and later attended the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (BIOLA). She enjoyed the opportunities the city provided, such as playing violin in orchestras and singing in radio choirs. During this time, Mennonite Central Committee was involved in mental healthcare reform in this country and looked for young people like her willing to serve. This adventure took her across the United States, from Pennsylvania to Mississippi to Newton, Kansas.\n\nWhile working for Prairie View, a new Mennonite-run mental health facility in Newton, Eunice met Elmer B. Friesen, who was also working with MCC constructing the new Prairie View facility. After finding a shared love of playing tennis, the two became a couple. They married on December 10, 1955, at the Reedley Mennonite Brethren Church, eventually making their home in Meade, Kansas, for many years. They had three sons, Dan, Don, and Duane.\n\nEunice was a hard worker. She worked as a nurse at the local hospital as well as manning the phoneline for her husband’s business, in addition to the tasks of keeping a house and raising three sons. She also found time to be creative. She created many paintings, ceramic dolls, embroidered items, and quilts in her years, earning her many blue ribbons at the county fair. Working in her yard and garden was another favorite activity, especially after adding a water garden in the 1990’s. A Saturday seldom passed where there wasn’t a pan of cinnamon rolls and maple bars on the table for morning coffeetime until just a few years ago. Elmer and Eunice loved to travel, from annual road trips to visit family in California to enjoying many bus tours in their retirement. They travelled to every state except Alaska, and also visited Canada and Mexico.\n\nOver the last years, dementia slowly changed her reality. Clarity turned to confusion, familiar faces of loved ones became strangers. Despite this, her spirits remained generally positive. She delighted in making new friends, which becomes a daily occurrence when facing severe memory loss. While the thought of living in a nursing home was originally a difficult one, she enjoyed her time there being with her friends all day long, playing board games and bingo, putting together puzzles and adult coloring. In her later years, she spoke often of looking forward to heaven. Her smile, generosity, and kindness will be deeply missed.\n\nEunice was preceded in death by Elmer, her husband of nearly 65 years, in 2020, her son Don in 2016, her parents and siblings, and many beloved cousins and friends. She is survived by her sons Dan and Duane, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Memorials may be sent to Fowler Residential Care or Mennonite Central Committee in care of Fidler-Orme-Bachman Mortuary. Memorial Services will be held at 1:00 p.m. Thursday, May 25, 2023, at the Countryside Bible Church, rural Meade. Interment will follow in the Graceland Cemetery, Meade.\n\nWilmer Merle Loewen passed away Saturday, April 8th, 2023 at the Iris Memory Care in Tulsa. He was 87 years old. A memorial service will be held 1:30 PM, Saturday, April 29, 2023 at South Tulsa Baptist Church, Tulsa, OK.\n\nMerle was born on June 6, 1935 to William W. and Margaret J. (Isaac) Loewen in Dodge City, KS. Merle and his parents lived on a farm in Meade County KS, and in 1937 they welcomed Roland Dean into their family. Merle and his brother, Rollie, had fun times playing and competing at sports on the farm, in between helping with chores. Since both extended families lived in the area, the boys also enjoyed many adventures with their cousins. The family was part of a German Mennonite community of farmers and so the Evangelical Mennonite Brethren Church was a central part of their lives. At the age of 12 Merle was baptized as a believer in Jesus Christ. He attended a country school through eighth grade and then he went on to the Meade Bible Academy, where he played basketball and sang in numerous musical groups. He graduated in 1953 with a High School diploma. Merle first attended Tabor College in Hillsboro, KS and then went to Omaha, NE to attend Grace College of the Bible. There he began courting Betty June Harder who was also from Meade. After they both received a three-year diploma at Grace College, they married July 6, 1956 at their home church.\n\nMerle and Betty moved to Topeka, KS where he fulfilled his CO Service at Menninger’s Psychiatric Hospital while taking education classes at Washburn University. Betty also worked at Menninger’s until the arrival of their first child, Michelle Renae in 1958. Their second child, Steven James, was born in 1960. After Merle completed his Degree at Washburn, he was offered a job teaching High School Political Science and History in Gardner, KS. He taught there for four years, and then the family moved to Haysville, KS where he taught for only one year. It was here that Don Learned became his life-long friend while they taught together. When Emporia State University called to offer a position at their Laboratory School, Roosevelt High, Merle made another career move. He remained at Emporia in the University’s Education department after the Lab School was closed. He received two advanced degrees, one in Education and one in Counseling during his time at ESU. Merle chose to pursue working as a High School Counselor at Eudora, KS from 1978-1984. He then finished his career in Ellinwood, KS as the High School Counselor, 1984-1997. He and Betty were very involved with their church, First Baptist of Ellinwood. They both sang in the choir and worked with the AWANA program. Merle also served as a church Deacon. One of his great joys was singing with the Kansas Mennonite Mens Choir and traveling with them to give concerts across the US and in Europe. At the same time Merle pursued an interest in genealogy and published several articles, including one about his grandfather Jacob F. Isaac. Merle and Betty enjoyed traveling to Africa and to Europe, as well as going to visit grandchildren in Emporia, KS and in Tulsa, OK. This season of life ended when Betty passed away in December 2015.\n\nIn October 2017, Merle decided to move to Tulsa, OK to be close to Michelle and her husband, Greg Bennett. He lived at University Village Retirement Community until a move to Heritage Point Memory Care was necessary. He was a member of South Tulsa Baptist Church where he enjoyed making new friends and singing in the choir. He also sang with the University Village Singers for a while. Merle was known for his sense of humor and his ready smile.\n\nAfter a long struggle with Alzheimer’s disease, Merle passed away to be with his Lord and Savior Jesus on Saturday, April 8, 2023. Merle is survived by his children: Michelle & Greg Bennett, Steve & Lisa Loewen, and his grandchildren: Emily & Evan McCall, Nate & Rebecca Loewen, Jeremy & Taylor Loewen, Andrew & Ashley Bennett, Amy & Daniel Knight, Dustin & Sarah Loewen, Brandon & Shannon Loewen, Joshua Loewen and Melissa Loewen. He also had eighteen great-grandchildren.\n\nThe family would like to express deep appreciation to Transitions Hospice for their wonderful care.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to First Baptist Church, 503A SE 110 Ave., Ellinwood, KS 67526, or to South Tulsa Baptist Church, 10310 S Sheridan, Tulsa, OK 74133 for the Sonshine Room.\n\nDavid Eugene Stoll was born on July 25, 1949, to Lavern and Lois (Stinemetz) Stoll in Colby, Kansas. He passed from this life to his eternal home on March 3, 2023, in Hays, Kansas, at the age of 73.\n\nDave was a lifelong resident of Logan County, Kansas. He grew up on the farm with his parents and three sisters that he later turned into his own family’s home. When he was eight years old, while helping his father plant wheat, his hand got tangled in the gears and resulted in the loss of a couple of his fingers. It never slowed him down as he played basketball, baseball, and learned to type with accuracy and speed.\n\nPulling pranks and practical jokes were some of his favorite activities. All of his nieces and nephews quickly learned who Uncle Dave was by playing his Money Grab Game. (The GREEN was where it was at.) He loved to be around people and make them laugh and have fun. He pulled many family and friends on car hood sleds on the snow.\n\nDave loved farming, especially harvest. He was the farm fix-it man with his skills in welding and mechanics. He enjoyed the many hours he spent on the tractor and saw many changes in farming practices and machinery. He was always willing to lend a hand to help a neighbor in need.\n\nAs much as Dave enjoyed the farming life he took great joy in having his family on the farm with him. It wasn’t surprising to see one or all three of his children (Letticia, Lance, or Layne) farming or doing chores with him. In later years his grandchildren also joined Dave as he continued farming, hoping to pass the torch to those who followed him.\n\nFollowing sports was a passionate pastime of Dave’s. Whether it was K-State sports, the Oakley Plainsmen, or the Golden Plains Bulldogs, Dave was ready to cheer for them with his game face on! It didn’t matter to him if it was football, basketball, volleyball, wrestling, track, FFA, or music, Dave was on the front lines for his kids and grandkids. Unique sports on the farm included his late-night rabbit hunts and fast-driving dog-chasing coyote hunts.\n\nWhile growing up Dave attended church with his family and at an early age accepted Christ as his Savior. He became a member of the Country Chapel Church of Oakley, Kansas, where he served many years as a board member. As a farmer he experienced many lessons about God’s sovereignty and learned to depend upon His providence.\n\nDave will be remembered by his family for his Big Red gum, his great steaks on the grill, as a wonderful father, grandfather, great grandfather, brother, cousin, uncle, and friend.\n\nDave was preceded in death by his parents, Lavern and Lois Stoll, nephew Jonathan Swhart, and a great niece, Tessa Ebert.\n\nLeft to mourn his passing are his daughter, Letticia Stoll of Friendswood, TX; his sons: Lance (Lisa) Stoll of Selden, KS and Layne Stoll of Oakley, KS. His sisters: Sylvia Stoll of Friendswood, TX; Linda Calhoun of Byers, CO; and Shirley (Bruce) Swihart of St. Francis, KS. He leaves eight grandchildren, ten great grandchildren, three aunts, many cousins, and lots of friends and neighbors.\n\nCelebration of Life Service is 10:30 a.m. Thursday, March 9, 2023 at the United Christian Church of Oakley with Pastor Bob Kelly officiating. Burial will follow in the Oakley Cemetery.\n\nMemorials: Oakley Booster Club, Oakley Country Chapel, and Oakley Wrestling Club may be sent in care of Kennedy-Koster Funeral Home, P.O. Box 221, Oakley, KS 67748.\n\nMitchall Wade Woodruff was born on May 1, 1961 in Beaver, Oklahoma he is the third child of Glenn and Ruby (DePew) Woodruff of Meade, Kansas. He left this life suddenly on Sunday, December 4, 2022 at Ashland, Kansas. Mitch grew up in rural Meade, Kansas and graduated with the Meade High School Class of 1979. While in high school he was involved in wrestling, football and track.\n\nMitch married Amber Snell in 1983 and to this union four children were born Chandra, Kirk, Morgan and Blake. While the family was young Mitch worked on the Fincham Ranch of rural Meade and later moved South of Ashland to work on the George Ranch. He then went to work in the Feed Mill at the Ashland Coop and was promoted to manager of the Ashland Coop Tire Shop until it closed. In 1991 The City of Ashland offered a scholarship to Pratt Community College to be certified to become an Electrical Lineman. Mitch was awarded the scholarship and off to college he went, on the weekends he worked for the City of Ashland until he graduated and became full time electrical lineman until 2014, where he made a career change and became a lineman for the City of Lucas, Kansas until 2018. In July of 2018 he returned to the City of Ashland and worked until the present.\n\nMitch’s true passion however was working with cattle or any livestock really. Anytime he could he wanted to be on the crew that was working cattle. He especially enjoyed that time with his son Kirk.\n\nMitch enjoyed hunting and later he was a supporter of his two boys as they traveled to many a 4-H trap shoot he enjoyed this so much that he volunteered to be the Shooting Sports Coordinator for the Clark County 4-H. He was also actively involved in helping all 4-H’ers from his children with their projects, to 4-H’ers today with their projects. He could be counted on to help get the Clark County Fairgrounds ready for the Fair each year. He was a past member of the Clark County 4-H Council and a 4-H project leader.\n\nMitch always had a twinkle in his eye, did not know a stranger and was always willing to stop and visit or tell a story.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his brothers Glenn Woodruff, Jr. and Ray Woodruff.\n\nMitch is survived by his parents Glenn and Ruby Woodruff of Meade, KS; Daughters, Chandra and Matt Walter of Hays, KS; Morgan and Lewis Nighswonger of Alva, OK, Sons: Kirk and Tess Woodruff of Ashland, KS, and Blake Woodruff of Alva, OK.

The bright oranges. reds, and yellows complimented her flaming auburn hair. It was the season for the landmarks of her life: her birth; marriage; the death of her life partner of 75 years; and 2 weeks later, her death.\n\nRuby Janice Jacobs Klein entered this world, October 24, 1926, as the daughter of Vernon Huntley Jacobs and Ruby Nancy Willett Jacobs. Her formative years were lived in Plains, KS. Janice’s characteristic personality emerged early: shy, curious, deeply intelligent, independent, with an appetite for learning and experiencing everything. By 8th grade she had proudly applied for a Social Security number and began a series of afterschool and summer employment opportunities at the local pharmacy, grain elevator and bank to earn money for college. Her dream was to attend medical school which did not materialize until her death, October 18, 2022, (one week short of her 96th birthday) when her body was donated to the KU Medical School Willed Body Research Program. Her family cheered! Mom earned an Associate Degree from Colorado Women’s College in Denver, CO., then studied pre-med at KU before she accepted the marriage proposal of her childhood friend, Wm. H. Klein Jr. It was a beautiful wedding in the Fall of 1947. The wheat crop had been bountiful and off they drove in Dad’s new Ford convertible for a six-week honeymoon in CA.\n\nWithin 3 years, they were homesteading on a farm 20 miles southeast of Tribune in what Mom described as a “chicken shed with an outhouse.” She felt like a pioneer living WITHOUT electricity, running water, an indoor toilet, or a telephone; and WITH a toddler, Kandee Kae, and a baby, William Huntley. Later Rock Alan followed by Kellee Jo completed their family.\n\nIt was no secret that Janice disliked living on a farm, “twenty miles from nowhere”. It was not the life she had earlier envisioned. However, Mom’s motto was “Bloom Where You Are Planted” and she did. In those early years, she concentrated on being the BEST Mom and wife she could be. Even then, the stack of notebooks on her bedroom dresser grew as she enrolled in academic classes through the Garden City Community College Outreach Program. Local instructors shared their talents with Janice in photography, art, crocheting and knitting. At the age of 57, Mom received her college diploma from St. Mary’s of the Plains College in Dodge City. Her proud family cheered.\n\nIn the late 1960’s after Mom launched her youngest child into elementary school, she seized the opportunity to become the X-ray technician at Greeley County Hospital and a clinical assistant to Dr. Willard Werner. As one of the first group of trained volunteer EMT’s, she rode in the ambulance with Dr. Werner to medical emergencies throughout the county. (The ambulance was the doctor’s station wagon!) She loved this emersion into the world of medicine and excelled at her responsibilities for 20 years. Her retirement coincided with her new goal of being the best Nana she could be to her grandchildren.\n\nJanice was into physical fitness and nutritional health way before it became a national obsession. Most mornings she started her day by walking or jogging a considerable distance followed by toning exercises on the living room floor. She was often seen riding her bike around town and walked the treadmill during inclement weather. Entrees from her kitchen were likely accompanied by vegetables, or fruit.\n\nMom was a classy, elegant lady. One of her “therapeutic” pastimes was shopping for clothing and shoes. It gave her a “high”, she said, and was a coping mechanism for stress. She had a knack for assembling tasteful outfits, meticulously accessorized, that brought many compliments.\n\nFaith was integral to her life. She read the “Daily Word” every morning-a habit inherited from her mother, Nana Jacobs. She actively studied the Bible underlining passages with yellow and pink highlighters. As a lifetime member of the Tribune Methodist Church, she held, at one time or another, most lay positions including Secretary and Treasurer. Generously and quietly, Janice donated regularly to local & national charities and helped individuals in need.\n\nKU sports was a passion. Attending a KU game brought her unlimited joy. At home she dressed in KU attire for every basketball and football game cheering for her team as she watched the game on TV. She never considered herself athletic but developed a love for tennis. She played regularly with a fun-loving group of women who caravanned to tennis camps and held an annual Wimbledon party complete with champagne and strawberries.\n\nIn the mid 1980’s when computers revolutionized the world, Janice was determined to ride the technology wave taking computer courses, reading software manuals and becoming proficient in basic applications. She gifted we kids and spouses with our first cell phones, converted the church office from paper to digital, & was the first on-line customer at local bank. In her 90’s, she continued to communicate with her family via e-mail, text and facebook from her i-Phone and MacBook Air. She NEVER stopped learning.\n\nIn October of 2016, our entire family gathered to celebrate Mom/Nana’s 90th Birthday. Three of her adult grandchildren summed up the ways in which Nana Klein had influenced their lives: Her faith; the way she led by example; her patience; her healthy lifestyle; her passion for KU; her love of lifetime learning, her philanthropy; her commitment to Papa and their marriage; and her unconditional love for family. That is her legacy.\n\nJanice was a dedicated Mom to her children: Hunt (Vickie) Klein, Rock (Teri) Klein, Kellee (Chris) Dixon, and Kandee Klein. She was a proud Nana to her grandchildren: Jennifer (John) Boggs, Levi (Michelle) Klein, Jeremi (Stewart) Whitham, Jentri (Nick) Hahn, Jasmine (Aaron) Kastner, Michael (Claudia) Klein, Robert (Amilette) Klein, William Joseph Klein and Karee (Taylor) Lundy and to her 16 great-grandchildren.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband; her parents; her dear sister, Patricia Joanne Utz, and husband, Carl; daughter-in-law, Marilyn Smith Klein; and nephew, Randy Lane Utz.\n\nJanice’s life was celebrated along with her husband’s, William H. Klein Jr., on October 22, 2022, in Tribune, KS. Memorials are suggested to the Wallace-Greeley Healthcare Foundation in care of Price & Sons, PO Box 161, Leoti, KS, 67861.\n\nA bright light was extinguished September 30, 2022, when William H. Klein Jr., age 97, took his last breath.\n\nBill was born on the family dairy farm southeast of Plains, Kansas, March 28, 1925. He was the last of 5 children and the only son. His sisters and mother, Dollie Elmena Packard Klein, spoiled him while his dad and namesake, William Henry Klein Sr., demanded hard work and strict discipline. Young Billy began milking cows at age 5-a mandatory chore, twice daily, for the next 11 years, instilling a strong work ethic that served him well in all facets of his life.\n\nIn the 7th grade a new music teacher arrived in Plains and discovered Bill’s natural, angelic, tenor voice. It was a gift he shared with the community as soloist for weddings, funerals, talent shows, church choir, and men’s groups. His ﬁnal public performance was at age 86 when he sang a duet with his then 7-year-old great granddaughter Grace. A birthday phone call to a family member regaling them with the Happy Birthday song was a treasured experience that he continued until his death.\n\nJust days after his high school graduation, Bill declined an agricultural deferment to join the US Army Air Corps. He returned 2 years later a 2nd Lieutenant with wings pinned to his lapel. The war ended before he could deploy with his ﬂight crew as a bombardier.\n\nIt was the Fall of 1947 when Bill married his lovely, red-headed, childhood friend, Ruby Janice Jacobs. They sped oﬀ to California in a new Ford convertible for their 6-week honeymoon. The wheat crop that year had been bountiful and sold for $2/bushel. Within 3 years they were homesteading on a farm 20 miles southeast of Tribune WITHOUT electricity, running water, an indoor toilet, or a telephone; and WITH a toddler, Kandee Kae, and a baby, William Huntley. Later, Rock Alan followed by Kellee Jo, completed the family.\n\nFarming and ranching were the core of Bill’s dry land agribusiness: growing wheat, milo and ensilage then grazing heifer calves on wheat pasture over the winter. It was a gamble to farm and ranch on this arid, ﬁnicky prairie; he prevailed with perseverance through the best and worst of times. The farm lives on!\n\nIn the 1970’s he joined other community investors to purchase the First National Bank of Tribune and sat on the Board of Directors for 29 years. Bill was a founding member of his beloved “Lunch Bunch”- a group of fun-loving individuals who gathered every weekday for lunch at the Dixon Drug cafe. Known for his personal and ﬁnancial generosity, Bill could not turn his head to a person or a community organization in need and likely contributed to every fundraiser ever held in Greeley County!\n\nHowever, Bill Klein will be remembered most for his charismatic, uplifting SPIRIT; his always-present SMILE and most of all, for his legendary, truly-unforgettable LAUGH.\n\nHe always cited his family as his most valued legacy: his wife of 75 years, Janice, to whom he gave all the credit for raising their 4 children; Hunt (Vickie) Klein, Rock (Teri) Klein, Kellee (Chris) Dixon, and Kandee Klein. He loved and was so proud of his 9 grandchildren and 16 great grandchildren,\n\nBill was preceded in death by his parents; four sisters, Myra (Olus) Vail , Ethel (Pete) McCormick, Agnes (Elwood) Hill, Shirley (Russell) McLaughlin, and daughter-in-law, Marilyn Smith Klein.\n\nHis life will be celebrated Saturday, October 22, 2022, 11:00 MST at the Tribune United Methodist Church pastored by Jeri Farmer Smith. Memorials are suggested to the Greeley County Library or the Tribune United Methodist church.\n\nRussell Olus Vail, age 81, passed away peacefully June 28, 2022, after a courageous battle with bladder cancer. Russell was born on January 28th, 1941, in Bushton, Kansas to Ruth Elizabeth Novinger and Russell William Vail. He grew up with two sisters, Joyce and Gloria, who helped raise him when his father unexpectedly passed away early in Russell’s life.\n\nHe grew up on the farms in Bushton, and later, Plains, Kansas. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout and always had a love for sports. His passion for hurdling and sprints led him to a successful college track career at Abilene Christian and Southwestern Colleges. He was a three time All American athlete/scholar.\n\nRussell married and moved to Washington, D.C. where he attended the American University for law school. He had an internship at the office of Senator Bob Dole and later entered the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Even though he later moved on from the FBI, he remained lifelong friends with this group of fine gentlemen. Always staying true to his legal mind, he worked with Ford Motor Company as a legal associate; and his later career took him to his own law practice and then real estate.\n\nRussell never lost an opportunity to travel and get to know new people. He always enjoyed a good meal with coffee and conversation to understand others’ point of view, political affiliations, and especially their sense of humor. He had a gift for disarming people with his candid and funny observations.\n\nIn his later years, post- heart attack, double knee and hip replacements, Russell still had that competitive spirit and social nature. He joined the Pegasus Race Walking Group. He greatly enjoyed all the members and had so much fun getting out on the track again. He was the example of how to stay active and make new friends, even in the later years.\n\nRussell is survived by his wife Jean Vail, daughters RaDawnna Rowland (Chris), DeLynne Siggaard (Torben) and son Britt Vail (Lauren), his grandchildren, William (Buster) Rowland, Russell Rowland, Conner Siggaard, Ryan Siggaard and Charleigh Williams, and his sister Joyce Vail Knott. He is preceded in death by his father, Russell William Vail, Mother, Ruth Novinger Vail, and his sister, Gloria Vail Fruechting.\n\nOf all the gifts Russell had athletically, which were many, he will be remembered by his kids for the time he spent just hanging out together. It was letting them make silly copies at the office, horseback riding, watching Saturday Night Live, spending time at the lake, and Sunday evening meals together.\n\nHe wasn’t the type to give a lot of advice, but the few pieces he did give will be remembered.\n\n“It’s easy to make friends, you just have to be one”.\n\nMemorial graveside services will be held at 11:00 a.m. Saturday, November 5, 2022, at the Plains Cemetery, Plains, Kansas.\n\nIf you would like to donate in memory of Russell, please consider Heart to Heart Hospice Services.\n\nCarol Ellen Borges Kuhns was born September 28, 1938, in El Paso, Texas to Thomas Edward and Ellen Brient Borges. She had one sister, Ann Borges Eubanks, of Houston, Texas. Growing up in El Paso she was surrounded by a loving family and many friends, especially those at First Church of the Nazarene, where she was a member. Her days were spent in various activities at school and church and socializing with her friends. Her parents both worked for the railroad and she had fond memories of visiting her mother at her job and watching her as she worked at her desk as a secretary. At an early age Carol began to have a real desire to be in the business world, working as part of a busy office staff.\n\nShe graduated from high school in May of 1956 and that fall she attended Pasadena Nazarene College. At the end of the first semester she returned to El Paso and enrolled at Texas Western College in El Paso. During this period of time, she met a handsome young soldier from Wichita, Kansas, by the name of Dick Kuhns, who was stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso. After attending college for one year she decided to get out into the business world. She had already held part time office positions for two different businesses and she soon launched into full time work at William Beaumont Army Hospital, working in their personnel department. However, her new career was soon interrupted by Dick, the soldier she had met and fallen in love with. After several months of dating and courtship Dick asked Carol to become his wife and they were married February 14, 1958. They moved to Wichita, Kansas where they set up their first home.\n\nThree children were born into this marriage – Henry Richard Kuhns, Jr., Thomas Edward Kuhns, and Julie Ellen Kuhns. After attempting to work and also be a wife and mother, Carol and Dick decided it would be better for her to stay home and care for their family. She spent the next 16 years being a housewife and mother, focusing most of her energy on her family and their needs. She was also active in the church, teaching 3rd grade Sunday School, teaching and helping in Vacation Bible School, and being active in other various children’s activities both at church and at the school her children attended. Sadly after 18 years of marriage, Dick and Carol divorced. However, this was not to be the end.\n\nWhen her children were teens Carol felt it was time to go back into the business world. She held various secretarial jobs for the next few years. In 1983 she began to feel God’s call on her life and knew that He was calling her to work at Nazarene Indian Bible College. In God’s timing she moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico to work at the Nazarene Indian Bible College. That was in February of 1985. She became Secretary to the President of the College. Shortly after arriving at NIBC her beloved Dick followed her and through God’s wonderful grace and mercy they were reunited in marriage, Dick accepted the job of Maintenance of the campus, which soon led to Work and Witness Coordinator and coordinator in the building of the campus. Carol and Dick enjoyed their work at the college very much and spent two different times working there – from 1985 to 1987 and then returned to the school to work in the same positions in 1994, staying in those positions until June of 1997 when First Church of the Nazarene called and asked Dick to consider returning to take over the care of the facilities there. Carol worked faithfully beside her husband for the next 10 years, helping with the care and maintenance of the building. In January of 2007, Carol and Dick retired and enjoyed their retirement years very much.\n\nCarol and Dick were blessed with three children, nine beautiful grandchildren who became the highlight of her life. She enjoyed having her children and grandchildren for Sunday dinners and babysitting the grandchildren. Her granddaughters liked to have sleepovers at Grandma’s house and she always made sure the refrigerator was stocked with good things. She always enjoyed watching them laughing and talking together. She also enjoyed her grandsons, going to their ball games and swim meets whenever possible. About the time the first of the eight grandchildren were all in high school, she was blessed with the ninth grandchild. He was such a delight to her and she enjoyed babysitting him and spending special “grandma time” with him. How often she remarked to Dick what a miracle of blessings God had bestowed on them giving them three wonderful children and their spouses and then to shower on them the blessing of nine fantastic grandchildren. Then as the grandchildren grew up they blessed them with 14 great grandchildren with a 15th on the way in 2023.\n\nThough her family was so very precious to her, Jesus was even more precious to her. She loved God with all her heart and strived to serve Him through her daily living. Through many storms and battles in life, Jesus was her strong anchor.\n\nCarol is survived by: two sons, Dr. H. Richard (Dick) Kuhns Jr. (Tamsel) of El Dorado, Kansas, and Thomas E. Kuhns (Denice) of Meade, Kansas; a daughter, Julie E. Omundsen (Dave) of Wichita, Kansas; nine grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her husband, Dick; parents, and sister, Ann Eubanks.\n\nMemorial service was held at Tuesday, October 25th, 2022, at First Church of the Nazarene (1400 E Kellogg Dr. S), Wichita, Kansas with Rev. Scott Marshall presiding.\n\nThe family welcomes memorials to the First Church of the Nazarene Living Water Ministry in care of Cozine Life Event Center, 11500 E 21st St N, Wichita, KS 67206.\n\nGerald Elmer Jacobs, 86, longtime resident of Plains, KS, passed away August 24 after a brief illness. Gerald, the son of Peter Jacobs and Felicitas Herrman Jacobs, was born in Plains where he was raised on the family farm along with his five siblings. This is where he learned his incredible work ethic. Gerald was an accomplished 3-sport athlete, a member of an undefeated football team, and earned multiple State gold medals in track & field. He graduated from Plains High School in 1956. He chose to forgo a college football scholarship offer in order to help his father, who was suffering from cancer, on the farm while also working at Beach Aircraft in Liberal. A vehicle enthusiast, this was when he purchased his first new car, a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500, which, regrettably, he was unable to keep long after realizing his $1.25 per hour pay meant an entire paycheck went to the car payment! He often lamented his sadness about not being able to keep that car.\n\nGerald married Lela Mae Baalman on August 30, 1958 in Dodge City, Kansas whom he met through his brother, Cap, who was married to Mae’s sister, Jeanie. Shortly after, Gerald’s father passed away, so he helped his mother by continuing to farm her land. This was one of many examples of his work ethic and generosity. To support his own family, he took on multiple odd jobs including installing water lines for the City of Plains, rolling discs for Glen Jones, loading grain for Collingwood, leveling ground with Ted Dreitz, custom cutting with Kyle Coats, farmed for Garrel Packard, and working the night shift on an irrigation well-drilling rig. In 1966, with the development of irrigation, Gerald became a full-time farmer and rancher. Working was his true passion and only hobby, constantly checking irrigation water and tending crops in the summer, and running wheat-pasture cattle in the winter. Additionally, he served on numerous boards, including the USD 483 school board from 1974 to 1985. He was a devout Catholic—a member of St. Patrick’s Catholic Church and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nGerald and Mae raised four children and somehow managed to never miss a single sporting event or activity. In 1993, they retired and moved to Dodge City. However, Gerald wasn’t suited for retirement, so he split his time between Dodge City and Plains, helping his son who had taken over the family farm. Gerald was very involved in his 10 grandchildren’s lives and enjoyed attending their activities. In 2017, he fully retired to care for Mae as her health declined.\n\nGerald is survived by his wife, Mae, of Wichita, KS; his four children: Lori Fleming and husband Rich of Copeland, Kansas; Rhonda Cook and husband Dave of Parker, Arizona; Shawn Jacobs and wife Kathy of Plains; and Dana Handy and husband Jerrod of Wichita, Kansas; his 10 grandchildren: Cami Faust and husband Mike of Houston, TX; Brendon Cook and wife April of Flagstaff, AZ; Taly Thiessen and husband Mark of Houston, TX; Savannah Downing and husband Marc of Ellis, KS; Brandi Gomez and husband John of Lake Havasu City, AZ; Rani Simon and husband Bryce of Lakin, KS; Deni Thill and husband Nolan of Garden City, KS; Rebi Ross and husband Kelby of Plains, KS; Daley Handy of Independence, KS; and Jacey Handy of Denver, CO; 21 great-grandchildren and two siblings: Alice Preedy of Keiser, OR and Dennis Jacobs and wife Wendy of Rogersville, TN. Gerald was preceded in death by his parents; his step-father, Aaron Marx; two brothers, Melvin and Casper Jacobs; and one sister, Eileen Dreher.\n\nVisitation will be Friday, September 2 from 9 am—3 pm at Fidler-Orme-Bachman Mortuary in Meade, KS. The vigil and celebration of Gerald’s life will be Friday, September 2 at 6 p.m. and the funeral Mass will be Saturday, September 3 at 10 a.m., both at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Plains.

Adrian farmed with his father and Mary worked at the Garden City Telegram until moving to the Fowler, KS area in 1960. Mary spent the next 24 years working alongside her husband on the family farm moving pipe, tractor and truck driving, swathing, and making the best field lunches in the county! All of this was done while raising six active children!\n\nMary enjoyed 4-H as a child and was a 4-H leader when her children joined. She participated in a local club called Coffee, Children, and Chatter (CCC) and a bridge club.\n\nMary was a very active member of Saint Anthony Catholic Church where she sang in the choir for many years, participated in the prayer chain, and helped cook many meals for church related events. She was a member of the Daughters of Isabella group. Mary and Adrian loved to jitterbug and relished the honor of leading numerous wedding marches over the years.\n\nEarly in her marriage, Mary worked at the Garden City Telegram and enjoyed writing a weekly article called “Mary-Go-Round.” In 1981, Mary returned to her print reporting roots as reporter and editor of the Meade Globe Press where she wrote “Kay’s Korner” for five years.\n\nIn 1986 Mary left the Meade Globe Press to work in the Register of Deeds Office. She was elected Meade County Register of Deeds in 1992. She retired as Register of Deeds in August 2007. She served many years as a member of the Fowler Library Board after her retirement.\n\nMary enjoyed gardening, cooking, crocheting, sewing, reading, attending all of her children’s school events and many of her grandchildren’s and great-grandchildren’s events as well. She was an avid fan of football, basketball, and track. Apart from being a diehard Goldbug fan, she rooted for the Kansas City Chiefs and Oklahoma City Thunder. She routinely provided the pro players and officials alike stern feedback when their efforts did not meet her expectations.\n\nThe family members that Mary leaves behind are numerous, diverse, talented, kind, and service-oriented—a group of people that she is, was, and always will be immensely proud of. She will look down from Heaven through all eternity with joy overseeing the good deeds of all her descendants.\n\n“Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.” – Ephesians 4:32 NLT\n\nIn lieu of flowers for her service, Mary would wish that you make a donation to the St. Anthony Catholic Church Building Fund or Fowler Residential Care.

They were together for 72 years. To this union four children were born: Jeanne, Butch, Jerry, and Tom. For the first three years, John farmed and did odd jobs. They moved to the new Cities Service Gas Plant (Hugoton Station) at Ryus, Kansas. They lived there for 35 years. They moved back to Satanta, Kansas, where John and Geneva retired.\n\nJohn was very active in his woodworking shop. He created many beautiful and wonderful things for his wife, children, grandchildren, and family members. Christmas was always an exciting time at the Alexander house. Lots of new surprises from Poppie’s “Chips and Sawdust” surround the Christmas tree every year.\n\nPoppie and Grammy loved to spoil their grandchildren and great grandchildren: cookies, candy, donuts, and ice cream were always found in the “freezer treasure box” downstairs. Poppie’s basement was the greatest playground for them all.\n\nIn September of 2018, they moved to the Lone Tree Retirement Center in Meade, Kansas. Poppie and Grammy enjoyed their years there receiving lots of TLC from the staff. He was always picking on someone, or they were picking on him.

George passed away at his home in Meade, January 28, 2022.\n\nGeorge was the 4th child of five born to Klaas H. & Helena (Doerksen) Reimer. As a young boy, he attended the McNaulty Country School. After his education, he served his IW service in Topeka, Kansas. After his service, he returned to Meade County and began his career as a farmer and stockman.\n\nGeorge, or as many people called him “Uncle George” was an uncle to everyone who was his friend. Uncle George had several passions during his lifetime. He loved to farm his land as well as doing custom cutting during the fifties. Another one of his passions was vehicles & motorcycles. He would enter his car in many car shows and received some trophy’s. He also, had a BSA motorcycle, which he would give a ride on it to anyone who asked. Uncle George also loved family and friends as he was always helping others. Even as his vision was deteriorating he would give rides to the Chuckwagon for dinner for those who couldn’t find a way there. He was an avid collector of belt buckles, and toy tractors with equipment. For several years he would travel around the U.S. with friends to enjoy the various treasures this country offers. During the last several years George was unable to be out very often as his vision was mostly gone. During this time his nephew Greg and friend Amy Delissa would care for him, bring him meals and have wonderful conversations about his life’s adventures.\n\nUncle George will be deeply missed. He is survived by 2 brothers: Ben D. Reimer and John D. Reimer both of Meade, many nephews and nieces, great nephews & nieces, cousins and friends. He is preceded in death by his brother Henry D.

He was born in Dodge City, KS, July 1, 1929, the oldest child of Roy H and Myrtle Pennington Fisher.\n\nDon’s childhood and elementary days were spent growing up on a farm in the Mertilla Township of northwest Meade County. He attended and graduated from Meade High School in 1947 and was recognized as a local and state-winning mile medal winner and center of the 1946 undefeated football team. Being a cowboy was about all Don Fisher ever knew. He had an innate love of animals of all kinds. His early love was horses, then Registered Hereford hogs for a few short years, then cattle and a good cow-dog. As a teen, Don raised a filly named Dixie Lou, and she became the foundation of Fisher Quarter Horses, 7-, with her bloodlines still going in his broodmares until their dispersal some eight decades later.\n\nHe began his calf-roping rodeo days as a teenager in the early 1940’s and was seen at rodeos across Western Kansas and Northern Oklahoma for many years. A special sweetheart was also seen accompanying him for the “ribbon roping” event. He and Warrenetta Marrs were married on June 4, 1947, at the United Methodist Church in Meade, and celebrated their 74th wedding anniversary in 2021. They raised their family of four sons in Meade, while Don was busy as a ranch hand, breeding and developing quality ranch horses, and working for several large cattle operations over the years in Western Kansas.\n\nDon is survived by his wife, Warrenetta, Garden City, sons Steven and Karla, Manhattan, KS; Stan and Cristyal, Derby, KS; Randy and Rhonda, Garden City, KS; and Bryan and Melonie, Duncan, OK. Also surviving are 13 grandchildren, 27 great-grandchildren; sister Carole Burner, CA; brothers and sister-in-law Jack Berghaus, Meade; Alfred Marrs, Meade; Virgil Marrs, Hays; Betty and Clarence Leis, AR. He was predeceased by his parents, sister Velva Berghaus and brothers Jimmie and Henry (Gene) Fisher.\n\nDon was mentored in the cowboy ways during his high school years by Western stockmen in the Meade area like Quimby Demmitt, A.W. Batman, and uncles Earl and Elmer Fisher and Roscoe Nash. A small roping arena built below the barn at the family home on the southwest corner of Meade made for easy practice, not only for Don but brother Jimmie Fisher and other Fisher cousins and friends. His four sons were also there to push calves, pull the chute string, and start learning their dad’s cowboy ways. Eventually, calf roping would give way to the team roping craze, where Don was as comfortable and skilled on either end of the steer. These hours of practice prepared Don for the days when running 2,000 to 4,000 head of cattle on wheat pasture and stalks would mean pasture roping every day to treat sick cattle.\n\nAs a self-taught livestock producer, Don seemed to have a natural instinct for knowing what animals needed. For several years, he spent most Tuesdays at the Meade Livestock Sale Barn, and if not buying cattle, spraying cattle, or processing cattle, he was there to help around the pens. In 1972, the lure of plentiful wheat pasture and flat plains that made for easy-to-build electric fence saw Don, Warrenetta, and Bryan move to Richfield, KS, where Don ran thousands of cattle for over 20 years. During this time, he also fulfilled a youthful dream of summering feeder cattle on ranches in northeast New Mexico. In the late 1980s, they lived in rural Menlo and have resided in Garden City since 1990.\n\nAs days grew shorter, the years passed faster, and the cattle market bottomed, Don traded in an electric fence for feedlot steel, and he practiced his honed skills of pulling sick cattle from pens and heading up the vet shack in several western Kansas feedlots. Feedlot managers and consulting veterinarians were known to brag about the reduction of sickness and death loss when Don was around their facility.\n\nA partial retirement brought Don and Warrenetta back to settle in Garden City in 1990. He continued to work at the horse barn where he stood his well know gray stallions, rode pens at a nearby feedlot, or helped out on a family livestock and hay operation until a major health issue slowed him down. His last feedlot cowboy paycheck came at age 86.\n\nDuring his teen years, Don was confirmed as a member of the Meade United Methodist Church, with continuing memberships in the Richfield and Garden City Methodist churches. He was a long-time 4-H leader in both Meade and Morton counties and served on the local County Extension Councils. Don was instrumental in the development of the Garden City chapter of Fellowship of Christian Cowboys, having served as President. He was an active supporter of the Journey to the Cross Rodeo Bible Camp in Garden City. He was a lifetime member of the American Quarter Horse Association and also a lifetime Gold Card member of both the United States Team Roping Association and the International Feedlot Cowboy Association, where he competed in the National Finals in Amarillo, Texas, and Garden City. Don was honored for his cowboy days of hard work and carrying on the western lifestyle as a participant in the Pro/Celebrity Team Roping Match held many years at the Beef Empire Days Rodeo and The Dodge City Round-up Rodeo. In 2005, Don was inducted into the Boot Hill Cowboy Hall of Fame as the “Working Cowboy” of Kansas.\n\nA celebration of Don’s life was held at the Meade First United Methodist Church, Monday, December 27, 2021, at 11:00 am. Burial was at the Graceland Cemetery, Meade.\n\nMemorials can be made to JTTC Rodeo Bible Camp, PO Box 1926, Garden City, KS, 67846, or left in care of Price & Sons Funeral Home.\n\nMary T. (Woodruff) Davidson was born June 11, 1936 in Fowler, KS. She passed peacefully with family by her side singing Amazing Grace at the age of 85, in Wichita, KS. Mary was the daughter of the late H. Dale and Clarice L. (Cook) Woodruff and had six siblings – Margaret, Dale, Kenneth, Phyllis, Glen and Eugene. She has always had a kind heart, caring nature, fiery spirit, and was full of spunk. She attended a one-room schoolhouse, Sunny Dale School in rural Meade County and later attended Fowler High School. Mary preferred being outside, playing with her brothers, or riding a horse bareback, with the wind in her hair.\n\nMary started dating Wesley J. Davidson after he returned from overseas and they subsequently married in July of 1955. When they were first married they lived in Dodge City, KS, relocated to a few different towns throughout the state, before settling in Wichita where they soon began their family. Wesley and Mary had two children together, Sondra (Davidson) Doll and Fred Davidson. From the time they were little and still now, the love that Grandma and Sondra/Fred have for each other is profound and strong. She was one of the most loving moms in the history of the world, understanding, patient, and thoughtful.\n\nWhen Sondra and Fred were a little older, Mary got a job at Wescon in Wichita, KS, where she worked her way up in the company from a plastics technician to a scheduler, staying for 33 years at Wescon until her retirement in 2001. Mary was known for being a hard-worker, never content sitting around when there was something that needed to be done. After retiring, Mary’s favorite thing to do was spend time with her family. Her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren were her pride and joy. She especially enjoyed attending her grandchildren’s concerts, plays, and sporting events and provided unending support. Mary was a member of St. Anne Catholic Church in Wichita, where she faithfully attended Eucharistic Adoration and was an active member of the Altar Society. She also was a long-time volunteer of the Lord’s Diner, where she enjoyed cooking and serving meals to those in need. Her strength came from her heart of service, her selflessness that never diminished, and the compassion for others.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her parents H. Dale and Clarice L. (Cook) Woodruff; husband, Wesley Davidson; siblings, Margaret (Merle) Mundy, Kenneth (Betty) Woodruff and Phyllis (Jim) Vanderpool. She is survived by her children, Sondra (Raymond) Doll, Cheney, KS, Fred (Cindy) Davidson, Augusta, KS, step-daughter, Diana (Jerry) Krehbiel, Haysville, KS; siblings, Dale (Joan) Woodruff, Glen (Ruby) Woodruff, Eugene (Carol) Woodruff; grandchildren, Valerie Ellis, Paul Doll, Theresa (Ryan) Runnells, Trevor Davidson (fiancé Corri Sanbeck), Zachary Davidson, Jaden Davidson; great grandchildren, Isabel Runnells, Gabriella Runnells, Jacob Runnells; step-grandchildren, Lavonna (Frank) Stoner and family, Karestin (John) Forge and family, and Theron (Kim) Lampe and family. She truly made the world a brighter and better place, and her generous and heartfelt nature and fiery spirit will be missed by all.\n\nThe Rosary was held at 7:30 pm on Sunday, Oct. 24, 2021 and the Memorial Mass took place at 10:30 am on Monday, Oct. 25, 2021, both at St. Anne Catholic Church, 2801 S.

He graduated from Meade High School in 1956 and attended Pratt Junior College on a track scholarship before enlisting in the United States Air Force in 1959. He was selected for Officer Training School and achieved the rank of Major by the time he retired. While in the Air Force, Lee earned his BS in electrical engineering from Oklahoma State University, a master’s degree in electrical engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology, and a master’s degree in computer engineering from the University of Massachusetts. He worked as a systems engineer in the Air Force, developing command and control systems for flight simulators. While working at the Aerospace Research Pilot School, he served under the command of General Chuck Yeager, where he received a letter of commendation from General Yeager. After his retirement from the Air Force in 1979, Lee worked for the Mitre Corporation as a consultant for the military until his retirement in 2000.\n\nLee often spoke about growing up in a small town in Kansas, where he was delivered by his aunts in his home. His father served as town sheriff, and for several years the family lived in the same building as the local jail, often eating meals with the prisoners. Possibly because of this, Lee was one of the most honest people you’ll ever meet. He had a love of country music (especially Don Gibson), home cooking, traveling, plays, and musicals. He was a man of many talents and was able to build anything without the need for instructions. He met his wife Dorothy, and the two married on March 3, 1962. He often shared that he couldn’t believe he convinced her to marry him. Together they moved around frequently for his job, living in Fairbanks, AK, Alexandria, VA, Stillwater, OK, Edward’s Air Force Base, CA, Wright Paterson Air Force Base, OH, Westford, MA, Rinteln, Germany, Heidelberg, Germany, Seoul, Korea, and Fredericksburg, VA. Upon his retirement, he moved to Hellertown, PA to be closer to his grandchildren, before finally moving to Center Valley, PA in 2018. Lee and his family traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia when he was stationed overseas and after he retired. He loved exploring new places and insisted on walking for hours, including a memorable trip to Rome with 8 straight hours of walking. Only later was it realized that the constant walking was because he had a hard time figuring out public transportation in foreign cities. Another one of his huge loves was dogs. He grew up surrounded by them, one of which met him every day after school to walk home with him. He was well known in his neighborhood for his beloved havanese, Meg, who came to live with him in March 2019. He made her home cooked meals every day and could often be seen taking her for walks.\n\nLee was predeceased by his wife, Dorothy (Snyder) McCullough in 2018, his parents, Glen and Alma McCullough, his sister, Loretta Gillen, and his brother, Art McCullough. He is survived by his son, Peter McCullough, of Doylestown, PA, his daughter, Susan (Seth) Tennant of Westfield, NJ, his brother, Charles McCullough of Richmond, VA, and several nieces and nephews. He was a loving “Poppy” to his six grandsons (Jackson, Max, and Luke Tennant; Riley, Reagan, and Logan McCullough) and enjoyed their concerts and sporting events until he was no longer well enough to attend.\n\nA service at Washington Crossing National Cemetery will be held in October. Helping others was always important to Lee. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the Mayo Clinic, 200 First St. SW Rochester, NY 55905, or to the Alzheimer’s Association, 225 N. Michigan Avenue, Floor 17, Chicago, IL 60601.

On August 11, 1930, she was born at home in rural Valley Falls, KS to John William Strawn & Luella Jane (Grahem) Strawn.

Together, they were blessed with five children: John Boley (Diana), Wakefield; Mark Boley (Connie), Concordia; Cindy Boley (Bennie), Myra Texas; Jay Boley (Deb), Meade; and Rex Boley, Mankato. Juanita was also a proud grandmother to 16 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren.\n\nWhen Louis and Juanita returned to her family’s farm her dad would often stop working when he saw family come home. He would say, “There is always time for work, but you never have enough time with family.” Juanita and Louis used this statement as the foundation to build their family. Juanita spent much of her life serving her family and others as a proud homemaker while her husband served in the Kansas National Guard. She valued the time she invested in her children in those primary years. When Louis retired, Juanita decided to return to work. She was employed at Cook Hardware in Eskridge, KS until it closed. She then accepted the Head Cook position at Eskridge Elementary School until her retirement. She loved to cook and often talked about her wonderful experiences with students and staff while working at Eskridge Elementary School.\n\nJuanita enjoyed supporting her husband during his military service while they lived in Topeka and Eskridge; however, they decided to move to Ellsworth, KS to be closer to their grandchildren. When they moved to Ellsworth, Juanita enjoyed spoiling her grandkids, cooking for others, being an active member of St. Bernard Catholic Church, Ellsworth County Senior Center, and Mutual Friends Investment Club. Juanita loved attending school functions of her grandkids and helping with the Ellsworth Ag Department annual greenhouse plant sale. She was proud of her rural up bringing and enjoyed telling stories about growing up being part of a large family on a rural farm in Jackson County.
