Dr. R. C. Sproul has called it one of the most important confessions of faith ever penned, and it has helped generations of Christians understand and defend what they believe. In Truths We Confess, Dr. Sproul introduces listeners to this remarkable confession, explaining its insights and applying them to modern life.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat book ruined by narration\n\nBy Mr. Steven K.

The audiobook is concise, gracious, and uncompromising. It is saturated with Scripture, church history, and practical experience. It is a handbook and encouragement for open air preachers. It is an apologetic for frontline evangelism. It is written for both individuals and study groups, pastors and laymen, open air preachers and Christians who evangelize. He who has ears to hear, let him hear this audiobook!\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThis is a good book\n\nBy Kindle Customer on 01-21-22\n\nGod vs. Government\n\nTaking a Biblical Stand When Christ and Compliance Collide\n\nBy: Nathan Busenitz, James Coates\n\nNarrated by: Bob Souer\n\nLength: 5 hrs and 50 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 33\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 30\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 29\n\nIn the spring of 2020, government mandates forced churches across North America to close their doors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As societal fear and unrest increased, Christians were forced to grapple with how God wanted them to respond to these state-imposed restrictions. After all, didn’t the closure of churches pose a serious threat in a time when people needed spiritual direction more than ever?\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nWorth the read\n\nBy C.

In this groundbreaking book, Matthew Barrett reveals a shocking discovery: We have manipulated the Trinity, recreating the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in our own image. We have distorted the biblical, orthodox Trinity to justify our countless social agendas. With clarity, creativity, and conviction Barrett mines the scriptures as well as the creeds and confessions of the faith to help you rediscover the beauty and simplicity of our Triune God.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nA must read for all Christians\n\nBy Anyone on 11-30-21\n\nMasculine Christianity\n\nBy: Zachary Garris\n\nNarrated by: David Webb\n\nLength: 9 hrs and 33 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 24\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 22\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 22\n\nThe Western church has gone feminist. God has given men authority in the home, church, and society. Yet the church has rebelled against God’s design and embraced the unbelieving world’s teaching that women should take on the same roles and duties as men rather than focus on the home and children. Christian scholarship and Bible commentaries are dominated by feminist arguments that both husband and wife should submit to each other (“mutual submission”).\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nMust read\n\nBy Anonymous User on 08-28-23\n\nActs 20\n\nFierce Wolves Are Coming; Guard the Flock\n\nBy: Alexander Strauch\n\nNarrated by: Micah Howery\n\nLength: 5 hrs and 44 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 8\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 6\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 6\n\nHistory amply demonstrates that the truths of Paul's message cannot be overstated or repeated too often. The appalling, centuries-long failure to stop false teachers from invading churches can be traced directly back to ignorance of or disobedience to Paul's prophetic warnings to the Ephesian elders. Paul's instructions and pleas to the Ephesian elders are just as critically needed today as they were that day on the shores of Miletus.\n\nTruths We Confess\n\nA Systematic Exposition of the Westminster Confession of Faith\n\nBy: R.
