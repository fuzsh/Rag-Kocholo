        "text": "Paperback. Condition: New. 400pp. [20.25 cm]. Illustrated wraps. Now available together in a single volume, these two classics were written by seventeenth-century England's most famous prisoner of conscience, Baptist John Bunyan (1628-1688). Imprisoned for twelve years for his preaching, he wrote first a dramatic allegory of Christian life and followed it with the compelling story of his own conversion. Both have been beloved by generations of spiritual seekers and still speak powerfully to modern readers. Pilgrim's Progress recounts the perilous journey of Christian from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, and in its second part, follows the journey of his wife, Christiana. Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners is Bunyan's fervent memoir of his own spiritual regeneration. Both works are enduring masterpieces of English prose, uniting the simple power of Biblical language with the vivid bluntness of untutored speech. A Vintage Spiritual Classics Original; First Edition.\n\nPaperback. Condition: new. Paperback. 'This fire is the work of grace that is wrought in the heart' In John Bunyan's classic allegory, Christian abandons his family and the City of Destruction and sets off for salvation. His path is straight but not easy, and he is beset by trials, including the terrible violence of the destructive Apollyon and the Giant Despair, as he pursues his pilgrimage through the Slough of Despond, the Delectable Mountains and Vanity-Fair towards the Celestial City. In the second part of the narrative his wife, Christiana, is escorted by Great-heart through the same difficult terrain. Written with the urgency of persecuted faith and a fiery imagination, The Pilgrim's Progress is a spiritual as well as a literary classic. In his introduction, Roger Pooley discusses Bunyan's life and theology, as well as the text's biblical and historial backdrop, its success and critial history. This edition also includes accompanying seventeenth-century illustrations, a chronology, suggested further reading, notes and an index. John Bunyan began this book while he was in prison for conducting unauthorised Baptist religious services outside of the Church of England. His path is straight but not easy, and he is beset by trials, including the terrible violence of the destructive Apollyon and the Giant Despair, as he pursues his pilgrimage through the Slough of Despond.
