It began as a hobby of sorts, until I showed some of the photographs and notes I had taken to a friend, Paul Montgomery. Paul introduced me to Shannon Davies, who looked over the initial scribblings and helped launch the project. Shannon was a great source of encouragement, and I am quite indebted to both Shannon and Paul. Bill Bishel, of the University of Texas Press, patiently waited for the volume and provided ideas critical to its content. Many people around the state provided information and help in finding gravesites, including Chanté Bryant, Llano Cemetery, Amarillo; Byron Kreuger, Austin Memorial Park, Austin; Kay Ann Yaklin, City of Austin; Greg Kreuger, Oakwood Cemetery, Austin; Alexandra Smith, Forest Lawn Cemetery, Beaumont; Edwina Thomas, Brenham; Monroe Shaw, Greenleaf Cemetery, Brownwood; Paul Dickey, Dreamland Cemetery, Canyon; Raymond Bouska, Greenwood Cemetery, Dallas; Pat Patterson, Laurel Land Cemetery, Dallas; Barbara Gross, Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park, Dallas; Kathy Johnson and Gail Heedley, Mount Olivet Cemetery, Fort Worth; Linda McBee, Galveston; Bonnie Ambrus, Glenwood Cemetery, Houston; Sammy Smith, City of Lubbock Cemetery, Lubbock; Eunice Anderson, Uvalde; James E. Evans, Oakwood Cemetery, Waco; and Joe Bob Wells, Richland Springs. Myretta Bell made a first review of the book, and her suggestions and ability to find errors were invaluable. Sherri Moore also reviewed the manuscript and provided many helpful comments. My love to my sister, Marilyn, for taking long trips to distant cemeteries and for reminding me with regularity, “I can’t wait until that book is finished!” Finally—for my friend John Graves—thanks for your inspiration and the wonderful hours spent talking on your back porch.\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 1\n\nintroduction\n\nI\n\nn the summer of 1967 I landed my first full-time job. The opportunity arose when a classmate resigned his job at Mount Olivet Cemetery, located just down the street from my northeast Fort Worth high school. He had been responsible for watering the acres of grass at the cemetery, and the tools of his trade—sprinkler heads, pipe wrenches, and joint sealant—now lay in want of new hands. He drove his own tractor and was his own supervisor, left alone to water the grass after class each day until the summer sun disappeared behind the headstones. It was a job highly coveted by the entire gang of boys who played football in the vacant lot across the road from Mount Olivet. All of us applied. Proving that in the corporate world it is not what you know but whom you know, the grounds superintendent recognized me as one of an endless stream of past neighborhood newspaper carriers. He gave me the job. It was to begin for me a lifelong interest in cemeteries. As water streams arched over headstones and shrubs, I often walked among the names and dates, trying to imagine how they might have looked and how they had lived. Friends were at rest in Mount Olivet. Occasionally, when the grass around the gravesite of a baseball teammate browned, I lingered over his flat, brass marker, daydreaming of once again lolling in left field while Terry patrolled center. The cemetery was replete with the people and history of Fort Worth, for each stone marked a life lived and memories created, some seemingly eternal, some painfully ephemeral. Working in the cemetery was a perfect union of my love of the outdoors and my love for history. The Fort Worth Independent School District was serious about the subject of Texas history as an element of public education. Maybe the state school board thought we might\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s forget the Alamo, I do not know, but the people and stories of Texas never left me. So why stop and walk through a cemetery in which none of your relatives are buried or where you know of no prominent person resting there? I suggest that the reason is that each cemetery is the same and each is different. A casual walk through a cemetery, any cemetery, provides a subtle sense of place and time, of what a town was in the past in contrast to what it is now. Cemeteries provide direct and often poignant links to our story, and no other section of a town more accurately records the legacy of its citizenry. For example, one need only stroll through the Old City Cemetery in Gonzales and feel the German presence recorded there to understand that Gonzales’ legacy is one of European immigrants in search of a better life in a distant and frequently dangerous land. The cemeteries of old Indianola, each with markers recording the seemingly instantaneous passing of entire families, document a populace that flirted with the catastrophic hurricanes, floods, and disease that swept the Texas coast in the late 1800s. And the huge granite mausoleums that line the streets of Oakwood Cemetery in Fort Worth stand in silent testimony to the rich trail-driving and ranching heritage that sprung from the Texas plains like prairie grasses. In a broader sense, Texas’ cemeteries reflect the entire American experience and the immense contribution that Texans made in the invention and reinvention of our nation. Texas has always been a place where big dreams and big landscapes collided to produce big legends. Texans are a pioneering people, independent, industrious, curious, bawdy, brave, proud, and occasionally outrageous. Texas is the final resting place of suffragists, industrialists, teachers, heroines, villains, and an American president. It is the home of innumerable veterans whose solitary white gravestones, scattered to every corner of the state, provide a sobering reminder of the staggering human currency paid to protect our homes and loved ones. Researching Texas history and traveling to hundreds of cemeteries tucked away in every corner of Texas were a revelation to me—an introduction to people and places that I scarcely knew existed. Terry Jordan’s book Texas Graveyards was an important source of information about cemeteries, but unlike that book, the present volume is not about the cultural significance of cemeteries, the occult mysticism that surrounds them, or a guide to deciphering the symbolism and traditions of burial. Jordan’s book and similar texts were written by peo2\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 3\n\ni n t ro du c t i o n ple who understand that side of the gravestone much better than I. Rather, this book is about the richness of humanity. Every cemetery has a story. In some cases, the story is the cemetery itself (Cowboy Cemetery near Mercury is a great example), sometimes it is both the cemetery and those buried there (Texas State Cemetery, Austin), and sometimes it springs from remarkable people in an otherwise unremarkable cemetery. In each cemetery listed, I searched for its story. As a result, some listings have extensive descriptions of the cemetery itself and minimal reference to the people who are at rest there. For other cemeteries, there is no description of the site itself but rather only references to those buried. Therein lies some level of what appears at first blush to be inconsistency among entries, but in fact, one finds remarkable uniformity in and among cemeteries, because each does have its own story. Traveling across Texas and slowly walking through hundreds of cemeteries was a wonderful experience. I came away from that journey with insights previously unheld. First, the contribution made by Texas’ women to the state’s history, culture, and quality of life is enormous and (in my view) largely underappreciated. Texas women have been great athletes, philanthropists, civic leaders, and pioneers. Of all the lessons learned in this exercise, that was perhaps the most personally important and gratifying. Second, the human capital cost of warfare is enormous. The rows of silent gravestones in our national cemeteries are a testament to young lives lost in defense of ideals that may be well worth that cost, but they also speak to our responsibility to ensure that warfare is an instrument of absolute last resort. Yet these gravestones also underscore the courage and commitment to comrades-in-arms that Texans have carried with them to all corners of the earth as they were called to service of this state and this nation. To those who read this book, it may seem I have a bias to military figures, particularly those Texans who have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Perhaps that is the case, but to include one recipient in these pages requires inclusion of all; no one sacrifice is any greater than another, and so all of those medal recipients who could be located have been included. The choice of the biographical sketches was made using three criteria. First, the deceased is buried in Texas in a public cemetery. Many noteworthy Texans lie at rest in family cemeteries on private property, and their gravesites are not readily accessible. Further, many other 3\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s notable Texans are buried in cemeteries outside the state, and those people were excluded. The second criterion was that of verifying the actual burial site. The gravesites of many Texans whose contribution should be acknowledged herein simply could not be found. Third, the person was a significant figure in Texas history or made a substantial contribution to its broadly defined culture. Texas history, folklore, and culture directly reflect the people who settled this state, fought for its independence, settled its frontiers, trailed its cattle, educated its young, and participated in its eternally wacky politics. Yet, if it appears as though a favorite cemetery, someone you know, or a prominent Texan is missing from this book and should be found among its pages, you are probably right: No single volume can encompass this state. My hope is that this book helps you find, visit, and enjoy just a few of the many stories to be discovered in Texas’ estimated thirty-five thousand graveyards. In a very real sense, producing Texas Cemeteries was a means to understanding the people who lived and died in a state that I have passionately loved my entire life. The responsibility inherent with being a native son, for me at least, required an interweaving of geography, history, and legend so that I could fully understand who I am. Somehow those of us lucky enough to have been born in Texas believe that we are different from those born somewhere else—not better, necessarily, but surely different. I always wondered why we believed that. Now I know.\n\n4\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nLocating the Cemetery and Gravesite You Are Seeking\n\nTips on Finding the Cemetery\n\nE\n\nstimates have placed the number of cemeteries in Texas as high as thirty-five thousand. Cemeteries are scattered throughout the state, and many have the same name. For example, there are at least thirty-five cemeteries named Evergreen in Texas and two cemeteries with that name in each of Bee, Harris, McLennan, and Runnels counties. But finding a cemetery or an individual gravesite is not impossible; in most cases it is only a matter of locating the right maps or library resources. Here are some good starting places. County Road Maps from the Texas Department of Transportation Of the map resources available for finding a Texas cemetery, I have found the county road maps from the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) to be very useful. TXDOT produces detailed road maps of each Texas county, and the locations and names of cemeteries within a county usually can be found on its TXDOT map. These maps are especially useful for finding locations of cemeteries within urban areas, and they negate the need for purchasing individual maps of cities. TXDOT county road maps are available in two forms, as singular sheets or in a bound volume of all Texas counties. These maps can be purchased from TXDOT, but most libraries maintain copies, and individual maps are often available at TXDOT district offices around the state. Information about purchasing maps, locations of district offices, and other useful information is available on the TXDOT website at .\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s County Genealogical Societies Almost every Texas county has a genealogical society, and its members are accurate and generous repositories of local history. In many counties, members of these societies have surveyed every identified cemetery in a county and have catalogued each of the gravesites in those cemeteries (up to the publication date of the catalogue, of course). Finding a member of a county genealogical society is usually as easy as contacting the county clerk’s office, the public library in the county seat, or a local funeral home. For example, the Rosenberg Library in Galveston has an extensive section on local history, including records of the local cemeteries. After inquiring at the library about the location of the gravesite of Angelina Dickinson, I was directed to a Galveston resident who helped in the search. A local funeral home provided maps of the Galveston cemeteries for me at no charge and then faxed them to me so I would have them when I visited two days later. The Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives and Library The Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives and Library Building, 1201 Brazos Street, Austin (directly east of the Texas State Capitol in the downtown area), is a terrific resource. Housed on the first floor of the building is a large, well-staffed Genealogy Collection with records of every sort imaginable, including complete cemetery records for many Texas counties. In many cases, not only are all the cemeteries in individual counties enumerated, but all the gravesites in those cemeteries are inventoried as well. If you know the county in which a person is buried, there is an excellent possibility the gravesite is recorded in one of these volumes. The Genealogy Collection includes an extensive microfiche collection and a useful array of other historical resources. The staff of the Genealogy Collection is helpful and available Tuesday–Saturday from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. U.S. Geological Survey Resources The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has mapped the entirety of the United States, and these maps (called “quadrangles” or “quads”) show the location of the surveyed cemeteries within the confines of that quadrangle. Each quadrangle map has a unique name and num-\n\n6\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nl o c at i n g t h e c e m e t e ry a n d g r av e s i t e ber. USGS quadrangles are produced at different scales, and the most useful scale for locating cemeteries is 1/24,000 (also referenced as 7.5minute series maps). Many libraries maintain a complete set of these maps, and the maps can be purchased from the USGS. The USGS maintains a website that allows easy access to a searchable database of all the surveyed cemeteries within a county, the location of the cemetery expressed as latitude and longitude, and the name of the 7.5-minute quadrangle map upon which the cemetery appears. However, my experience is that some cemeteries in a county do not appear in this database. Still, having access to the latitude and longitude of a cemetery can be very useful in finding the location of a cemetery using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Using GPS The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed from a constellation of twenty-four satellites and associated ground stations. The technology works by triangulation, with position on the surface of the earth calculated from signals transmitted from these satellites and received by a GPS unit. Upon receipt of these signals, geographic position (latitude and longitude) of the receiver is displayed. GPS is a powerful navigation technology that is readily available, inexpensive, and easy to use. In fact, many automobile manufacturers include GPS units as an option to help motorists locate destinations, speed of travel, estimated time of arrival, and current position. An internal function—often referred to as a “Go To” function—is used to navigate to that known location stored in memory. For example, if you enter the GPS coordinates for the Greenwood Cemetery in Weatherford and turn your GPS unit on as you travel, the unit’s “Go To” function will direct you to the cemetery. Further, many websites now have GPS coordinates for specific gravesites that can be downloaded. Entering these coordinates into the GPS unit will allow you to locate the gravesite almost immediately. As you thumb through this book, you will find GPS locations of all the cemeteries referenced in this volume. These are included to aid you in finding cemeteries throughout the state. But GPS locations for individual gravesites are not included—that would eliminate most of the fun of discovery!\n\n7\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s\n\nSkipping Stones—Tips for Finding a Gravesite Searching for a particular gravesite in a cemetery can be either great fun or a great source of frustration, depending on the size of the cemetery, the condition of the marker, and the depth of your patience. But here are some techniques that greatly enhance your skill in locating the site you wish to find. Contact the Cemetery’s Administrator If the gravesite you seek is in an expansive cemetery like SparkmanHillcrest in Dallas or Glenwood Cemetery in Houston, do not waste your time trying to locate the site on your own. These cemeteries are much too large for you to experience much success by walking or driving through the cemetery. Some cemeteries have twenty thousand or more gravesites, and finding a site without knowing its location in advance is akin to looking for a particular rock in a quarry. If you are searching for a series of sites, you may find some of them, but you will not find them quickly and it is highly unlikely that you will find them all. For example, I invested more than a hundred hours walking through Oakwood Cemetery in Austin, searching for about fifty individual gravesites, and there were several I could not find. A call to the administration office yielded quick results. The bottom line is that if time is at all a consideration, begin your search in the cemetery office. The administrators at urban cemeteries are extraordinarily helpful in locating gravesites. In many cases, they will provide not only the location of the site but a map of the cemetery as well. On several occasions a cemetery manager actually accompanied me through the cemetery to help in my search and provided interesting information in addition to that which I was seeking. The administrator of the Greenwood Cemetery in Dallas spent a very cold, wet morning showing me the interesting sites there and explained in detail the many types of stone used in grave markers, how they were carved, and the source of the stone. The staff at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Fort Worth quickly aided in my search and provided stacks of information about other cemeteries in Tarrant County as well. If your travels do not allow you to visit the cemetery during regular business hours, consider writing to the cemetery administrator prior to visiting and asking for a map of the cemetery with the gravesites indicated. It works. Check for Local Cemetery Associations In many cemeteries, administration is provided by local volunteers, 8\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nl o c at i n g t h e c e m e t e ry a n d g r av e s i t e usually in the form of a cemetery association. Quite often the phone number or address of an association representative is provided on the cemetery premises, either near one or more of the entrances, on the cemetery maintenance building, or on the door of the cemetery administration building. Also, check the local phone book; in some instances the phone numbers of local associations are listed there. On a venture to the Prairie Lea Cemetery in Brenham, after having looked two hours for a headstone, I found a phone number for the local cemetery association and called. Within a matter of seconds I was told exactly where to look, and the location was right on target. Search East to West In most cemeteries, the people interred there are laid to rest facing eastward. Markers are not called headstones without reason; the markers stand at the head of the deceased’s burial plot, and the inscriptions on the headstones appear on the east face of the stone. So, if you start from the east and go west in most cemeteries, the inscriptions on the stones will be easily readable as you walk or drive. That is not always the case, however; many of the stones in the International Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery in Georgetown face west, and the stones in the Panteon-Hidalgo Cemetery in New Braunfels face to every point of the compass. But the majority of cemeteries are laid out so that an east-to-west line of travel will save a lot of time in finding gravesites. Find the Large Upright Monuments and Mausoleums If you are searching for the gravesite of a prominent person, particularly one buried before World War II, look for an upright marker bearing the family name of the deceased. Many notable people buried in the late 1800s and early 1900s have large markers, obelisks, statues, or granite slabs as headstones. The oldest parts of the cemetery will almost invariably have the largest concentration of upright markers. This is an excellent means for immediately finding the historic section of the cemetery. If the deceased was wealthy, do not neglect the mausoleums. The cluster of private mausoleums in Fort Worth’s Oakwood Cemetery looks like a housing development where each successive builder tried to outdo his neighbor. Two of Texas’ most wealthy and successful cattlemen, Samuel Burk Burnett and John B. Slaughter, each rest in huge private mausoleums across a paved road from one another in this cemetery. 9\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s Know the Deceased’s Date of Death Quite often burials are clustered by date of death. In some ethnic-German cemeteries, for example, burials take place in near chronological order, so that knowledge of the deceased’s date of death will lead you to the gravesite rather easily. In other cemeteries, the oldest parts of the graveyard are also clustered and tend to have the vast majority of upright monuments. For example, walking into the Salado Cemetery, one notices that most of the upright and ornate monuments are located in a fairly small area in the center of the cemetery. If the date of death of the person you are seeking is not within a decade of the dates on the stones most proximate to where you are looking, there is a strong likelihood that the person whose gravesite you are seeking is buried somewhere else in the cemetery. This location method does not always work, but it is a great way to find a site in the majority of cemeteries I visited. Look for Texas Historical Markers If you are searching for the gravesite of a prominent local person or historical figure, keep an eye out for historical markers placed by the Texas Historical Commission. The historical marker may not mark the site you are looking for, but it is likely to be in a part of the cemetery where other interesting gravesites are located. Two of the most historically significant gravesites in all of Texas are in the Greenwood Cemetery at Weatherford. The graves of cattle trail legends Bose Ikard and Oliver Loving are in that cemetery, and both headstones are small, rather inconspicuous stones that lie flat on the ground. However, both men’s graves are also marked by Texas historical markers, easily seen from almost any vantage point in the cemetery. This strategy, as simple as it seems, works superbly. It is also an effective way to find information about local citizens or notable Texans who might be buried there. While visiting the Greenleaf Cemetery in Brownwood, I spotted a historical marker for writer Robert Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian), for whom I had no burial site location information prior to my visit. I would have missed his grave without the guidance of the marker. Use the Burial Lists at National Cemeteries Finding a gravesite in one of the national cemeteries is easy because complete lists of all burials in these cemeteries are maintained on the 10\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nl o c at i n g t h e c e m e t e ry a n d g r av e s i t e premises of each. For example, the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery has gravesite listings and maps available in several kiosks throughout the cemetery. Each tombstone in these cemeteries has a grave number on the back of the stone, so locating a gravesite is a simple matter.\n\n11\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nShooting Stones— Taking Great Photos in a Cemetery\n\nS\n\nhooting good photographs in a cemetery is no more difficult than in any other type of outdoor location, and any camera will take excellent photos of headstones or cemetery statuary under favorable light conditions. Like landscape photography, almost everything of interest in a cemetery is stationary, which multiplies the options for use of slower film speeds (sharper images), narrow lens apertures (greater depth of field), and long exposure times (low-light conditions). Unlike most landscape photography, there is little color and contrast variation in headstones. Still, there can be some situations unique to cemeteries that require a little work and planning if you want to capture a good image.\n\nEquipment In addition to a camera and a tripod, a few other items might come in handy when shooting photos in a cemetery: • A gallon-size water container (for wetting and cleaning headstones) • A white umbrella (for shade and rain protection) • A ladder or step stool (for unusual points of view) • White poster board (for shade and bounced flash) • Grass clippers (for removing stray blades) • A blanket (a lifesaver if you are wearing shorts and want to kneel) • A broom or brush (for cleaning markers) • A small rake (for removing debris and reptiles)\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 13\n\ns h o o t i n g s to n e s — ta k i n g g r e at p h o to s A word of caution is appropriate. Cemeteries, particularly those that are not regularly maintained and have high grass or accumulated debris, are havens for wildlife of every sort—including snakes and insects capable of quickly disturbing your visit. Stone markers can be especially attractive to snakes seeking a place to bask in the sun and warm their bodies. The cracks and crevices in and around headstones make excellent hiding places for spiders and my personal nemesis, scorpions. Before setting up to photograph objects in any cemetery, take a minute or two to closely examine the immediate area around and on the marker or statue. The largest snake I have ever seen crawled leisurely from under a flat marker in a McCulloch County cemetery and into my camera viewfinder.\n\nComposition Tips Like flash photography, composition is an art in itself. But following some easy composition tips will result in much better photos. Clean Up the Area First, make sure your subject and its surrounding areas are reasonably clear of litter. A modicum of leaves and sticks can actually add to the character and mood of an image, but too much organic litter is distracting. Raking away grass clippings and leaves that have accumulated around the base of a stone provides a much cleaner image, and I have often used a pair of grass clippers to trim upright blades of tall grass standing in front of a marker. Headstones, much like statues, are also a favorite perching place for birds, and a little housecleaning goes a long way. Dousing the headstone with plain water and brushing it with a broom quickly remove bird droppings, loose dirt, and other debris, as well as providing better contrast between the inscriptions and the marker itself. Although many cemeteries have a readily available source of water, carrying a gallon or two along with you is a good idea. After selecting your subject and before you snap the picture, take a few seconds to examine the edges of the viewfinder closely for distractions. A camera does not “see” the same way our eye gathers information. When we look at a subject, we tend to focus on what is important to us as we see it in the viewfinder. Somehow, our mind seems to filter out the distractions that our eyes see but do not register. We may see a perfectly carved granite headstone and not notice the weeds, wilted flowers, dead sticks, and loose papers around its base— 13\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s unless we take time to really look for them. However, the camera sees everything, and the beauty of an immaculately carved headstone or statue may be lost in the chaos of distractions captured in the exposure. I once spent several hours in a cemetery waiting for that single moment when the setting sun set the stone of an angel perfectly aglow. Later, upon viewing the image, I was thrilled with the light that bathed her face. However, also captured in the photo was a water sprinkler. Below eye level and unnoticed, it appearing to be growing out of her foot. Consider the Point of View Point of view, the camera position relative to the subject, is a critical element in taking good photos in general and cemetery photos in particular. Burial grounds are full of upright headstones, markers, statues, fences, and shrubs—all in proximity to one another. Such visual background noise can be distracting in the final image. Consider the relative position of the camera to the subject, and then select the light and background that best remove any distractions that compete with the viewer’s attention to the main subject. Take a few seconds to look at the background and edges of the viewfinder before you shoot; sometimes just moving a few inches can make a big difference in the impact of the printed image. Because headstones and markers come in so many shapes and sizes, managing the angle of view (the position of the camera relative to eye level) takes on a new significance. The most pedestrian photos in the world are photos of headstones shot “head-on” at eye level, while different perspectives captured by an unusual angle of view can be very interesting. For example, statues shot from a bird’s-eye view or obelisks photographed from directly below the spire can produce intriguing and powerful images. Finding interesting angles of view is a snap when photos are shot from elevated positions or from ground-level positions. Not only is a short stepladder necessary to get directly above upright markers and flat markers, but the elevated angle of view also creates unique perspectives. Similarly, a blanket provides a nice means of kneeling or lying on the ground to explore unusual angles of view below those of eye level. Clearly, there is no “best” point of view or angle of view. But often there are better ones than the first one you see. Composition is all about exploring alternatives to standing in front of the subject and firing the shutter. When you are photographing headstones and mark14\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 15\n\ns h o o t i n g s to n e s — ta k i n g g r e at p h o to s ers, you are not working with the most inherently colorful or dynamic subjects. Taking a little time to find an unusual point of view can make a big difference.\n\nChoosing the Right Film for Your Camera Any film will suffice when taking cemetery photos, but the choice of film speed can have a noticeable effect on the quality of the final image. Clarity of image is paramount in shooting headstones or statuary because much of the beauty and information conveyed is in the detail of the object. Film is a light-sensitive medium, and images are captured on the film by controlling its exposure to light. The film speed is a measure of the film’s sensitivity to light and is indicated by its ISO rating. The higher the ISO number, the more sensitive the film is to light, and the less light is required to capture the image. Although faster film—say, ISO 400—can certainly be used to shoot headstones or other images in a cemetery, the trade-off comes in image quality. In general, the “faster” the film (the higher the ISO number), the “grainier” the final image. I have had excellent results using “daylight” film with a film speed of ISO 200 or less. The quality of the image is sharp, and the colors are usually as vibrant as can be expected under the circumstances. After all, as often as not you are photographing a rock! Artificial lighting, low light, and the highly polished surface of crypts in a mausoleum cause some unique problems. Ordinary tungsten-filament light bulbs tend to give most “daylight” films a warmer tone than that observed by our eye. Special indoor films, or “tungsten” films, compensate for the color shift and are readily available. However, unless you are planning to shoot a whole roll of film in a mausoleum, you might consider using daylight film and a flash unit.\n\nUsing a Tripod In low-light situations, particularly when using slower ISO films (especially slower than ISO 100), a tripod or its equivalent is a necessity for sharp image production. Lengthened exposure times (slow shutter speeds) go hand in hand with dim light. If the camera’s exposure time setting is 1/30th second or longer, it is virtually impossible to operate a handheld camera without generating movement sufficient to produce a blurred final image. A tripod will save film costs and perhaps prevent return trips to 15\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s rephotograph markers. Tripods can be exorbitantly expensive, but I have used a small, lightweight “backpack” tripod (purchased for $15) that worked quite well. If your camera cannot be mounted on a tripod, a beanbag placed on the ground, a nearby marker, a ladder rung, or a box will produce a stable photography platform. Although flash photography is an alternative to slow shutter speeds and a tripod, polished stone and metal markers tend to reflect the light back into the camera lens, much like the flash reflection created by eyeglasses worn by a portrait subject. For most of us, slowing the shutter speed is certainly easier and usually more reliable than flash photography.\n\nLighting For consistently good-quality photographs, consider shooting headstones, markers, and statuary on cloudy or rainy days. The diffuse light tends to soften images, provides a subtle mood, and relieves problems like reflectance and uneven lighting produced by direct sunlight. The contrast is often not as good on cloudy days, but in general, there is not much contrast inherent in the subject or its environment. Plus, you can correct some of the difficulty with contrast by using one of a series of color-correcting lens filters. If you must photograph on sunlit days, early morning and late afternoon provide the best lighting for upright markers; midday sunlight provides good lighting for flat headstones.\n\nShooting Flat Headstones Midday sunlight tends to be harsh, particularly in a cemetery with few or no trees, and the direct overhead rays striking markers that are set flat with the ground can be blinding. In addition, sunlight filtering through tree leaves usually provides a dappling effect on the surface of a stone or marker, making correct film exposure more difficult. But solutions to the problems of midday sun are easily found in a gallon of water and a white golf umbrella. Stones and metal markers can get very hot when exposed to direct sunlight, even in winter months (remember the snakes and insects). Water slowly poured onto the surface of the stone cools the surface and reduces its reflectance. The water also collects in the carvings of the stone, making the letters and numerals much easier to visualize by improving the contrast between the inscription and its surroundings. 16\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 17\n\ns h o o t i n g s to n e s — ta k i n g g r e at p h o to s On very hot days, wet the stone thoroughly, let it dry, and then wet it again. The water evaporates more slowly after the second wetting, allowing time to focus the camera, secure a good exposure, and snap the shutter. A white golf umbrella provides an excellent means of shading flat markers and provides uniform lighting across the face of the stone. Golf umbrellas are inexpensive and large, perfect for providing maximum shade with frugality. Although any color of umbrella will suffice, white umbrellas allow more light penetration through the fabric onto the marker, again facilitating longer exposure times. Colored umbrellas will work, but my red one, for example, tends to produce an unnatural color and allows less illumination of the subject. Since flat markers are just that, flat with the ground, they are considerably more challenging to photograph than are upright markers. Interesting points of view are harder to find when shooting flat markers, largely because the markers tend to be two-dimensional. But a stepladder provides some alternatives because it allows the photographer to position the camera above and away from the marker. The quality and choices in composition of flat marker photos are much better when the camera is elevated. For example, before I used a stepladder, most of my photos of flat markers were accentuated by the presence in the image of one or both of my feet.\n\nShooting Upright Headstones Early morning or late afternoon sunlight is much less direct, creating warmer tones and eliminating the glare or reflectance that is characteristic of almost all polished stone markers. Unfortunately, photographing upright markers and statues depends upon the east-west orientation of the structure and its engraving. Markers usually receive morning sunlight because most people are buried facing east, but that is not always the case. For example, many of the numerous upright markers in the Texas State Cemetery are engraved or carved on both sides of the stones. Letters and numerals on upright markers can be hard to visualize clearly through the camera lens at midday, when the sun is directly overhead, because there is little contrast between the carvings and the surface. Moreover, upright markers with raised letters and numerals can produce long and rather ugly shadows on the marker face during midday. Still, as with flat headstones, the contrast of carvings and inscriptions on upright markers can be enhanced by pouring water on the stone’s surface. 17\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s If your desire is to photograph upright stones in a cemetery, plan on being in the cemetery at sunrise and sunset to take advantage of sun angles and the direction of light. For example, shooting an eastfacing marker at sunset results in the full sun directly behind the marker and shining straight into the camera lens. Unless you choose to fill the frame with the headstone or statue so that the backlighting is completely blocked, the resulting image will often be poorly exposed. In addition, an east-facing monument itself shades the markings on it as the sun sets in the west, making the inscription difficult to read. The bottom line is that east-facing stones are best photographed in the morning, and west-facing stones are best photographed in the afternoon.\n\nUsing a Flash In some lighting situations, a flash unit can vastly improve the quality of the photos you take. However, if there is insufficient ambient light to illuminate a marker fully, then using a flash unit will illuminate the stone, but the background of the photo will be almost totally black. Flash units therefore should be used only to supplement natural light and not to replace it. Flash photography is an art in itself, and its nuances are beyond the scope of this volume. Still, here are some ideas that will help you use a flash to photograph cemetery objects. Again, highly polished headstones and metal markers tend to reflect the flash strobe back into the lens, particularly if you photograph the marker head-on. Head-on pictures are usually not very interesting even in the best of light, and when flash is used, the results are often terrible: a huge light burst in the middle of the image. You can generally get better results by taking an angled, indirect shot of the headstone, usually from the left or right side of the marker. A little water on the stone sometimes, but not always, helps reduce reflectance. When headstones are in bright overhead light, the shadows from surrounding vegetation and the shadows cast by the stone itself often obscure inscriptions and other details. These can be revealed, and shadows lightened, by using your flash; this technique, called fill flash, illuminates those areas that ambient light does not reach. Keep in mind that reflectance off the face of the stone may still be a problem if the shot is taken head-on. Fill flash also works well to illuminate an upright marker when the sun is shining on the side of the stone opposite the engraved side. For 18\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 19\n\ns h o o t i n g s to n e s — ta k i n g g r e at p h o to s example, using a fill flash on an east-facing marker at sunset, when the west face is being illuminated, can produce a well-exposed image. The fill flash brightens the shaded side of the stone, and the attendant backlighting provided by the sun can be quite beautiful. This technique, in my opinion, works nicely when photographing statuary. The fill-flash exposure of a statue against a clear blue sky can be striking and “opens” the statue’s numerous shadows and its subtlety. If your flash-head angle is adjustable, try bouncing the flash off a sheet of white poster board and onto the subject. Position the white poster board over or near the marker or crypt face, making sure that the poster board does not appear in your viewfinder. Aim the flash unit at the white poster board surface, and bounce the flash off the poster board onto the subject. Be sure to use only white poster board; otherwise the subject may pick up the color cast by the board. A bounce flash technique can be useful if you are photographing in a mausoleum. The flash tends to overcome the tint of tungsten lights in a mausoleum and also compensates for low light levels. I have generally found that daylight film used in conjunction with a bounced flash yields quite satisfactory results in these situations.\n\nUsing Lens Filters Lens filters come in a variety of sizes and colors and can produce dramatic special effects. Three types of filters can be handy in photographing cemetery stones: a polarizing filter, a warming filter, and a UV/haze filter. Polarizing filters work in the same manner as polarizing sunglasses and are effective in removing reflecting light from surfaces like polished stone, glass, or water. Polarizing filters are most useful for increasing general outdoor color saturation and contrast. Polarization is angle-dependent, and as you aim your camera either more into or away from the sun, the effect will gradually diminish. There is no polarizing effect if your lens is pointed directly toward or away from the sun. Warming filters do a great job of improving image quality on rainy and overcast days, although these filters are more useful for capturing landscape images than for creating images of headstones. On overcast days or in shadows on sunny days, the light is a bit cool and bluish. The yellow-amber 81 series of filters remove the blue tone, resulting in a warmer tone to the photo. Film often exhibits sensitivity to invisible, ultraviolet (UV) light. 19\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nt e x as c e m e t e r i e s Ultraviolet filters absorb UV light, usually without affecting visible light. These filters are used most often outdoors, especially at high altitudes, where the UV-absorbing atmosphere is thinner, and over long distances, such as marine scenes. Ultraviolet light can show up as a bluish color cast with color film, or it can cause a low-contrast haze that diminishes details, especially when viewing distant objects. UV/haze filters absorb the ultraviolet rays that can make outdoor photographs hazy and indistinct. These filters also serve as a lens protector and can be kept mounted to the camera lens at all times.\n\n20\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nAround the State\n\nAbilene Elmwood Memorial Park Highway 277 at Twilight Trail N 32 24.862, W 099 48.021 J e s s i e K e n a n Wi l d e r Jo n e s Jessie Jones (1882–1969) dedicated much of her public life to civic service. On a trip to Colorado with her children in the 1930s she found that there was no shady spot along the road where she could stop with her children and rest or eat lunch. Apparently, as she ate under the shade of a railroad trestle, an idea took root. At a highway beautification meeting, she proposed a project to construct roadside parks. The concept gained momentum after finding a champion in Governor Miriam Ferguson. The multitude of roadside parks that now dot the Texas landscape are the direct result of her interests. Her service to the people of Abilene continued throughout her life, and her gifts touched the lives of every citizen of that city.\n\nActon Acton Cemetery FM 4, near intersection with FM 1192 N 32 26.412, W 097 41.062 Acton Cemetery has within its confines the smallest state park in all of Texas.

Mrs. Crockett received a grant of 320 acres in Hood County (although it was still part of Johnson County at the time) from the state of Texas for her husband’s sacrifice at the Alamo. Their 0.006-acre gravesite is maintained by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department as a state historic site and is marked by an immense granite stone (erected in 1911) and the westward-facing statue of Elizabeth Crockett. The cemetery also has several excellent examples of limestone false crypts, most of which are near the Crockett gravesite. The excellent stonework of these crypts, particularly the monolithic limestone tables that cover them, is among the finest to be found in Texas. A series of impressive oak trees surrounds these crypts, and these trees were alive with both raucous chickadees and barking squirrels on the November day that took me there. Along the back border of the Acton Cemetery is a rock fence meticulously constructed of unmortared limestone. In several places, trees have grown through and toppled a bit of the fence, but it remains in remarkably good condition and is a monument to patient hands. If you visit the Acton Cemetery, try to go after the first freeze of the fall. This cemetery is replete with native Texas pecan trees that produce an abundance of nuts. Walking among the markers in the cemetery, I gathered a small sack of the richest pecans imaginable.\n\nAlleyton Alleyton Cemetery FM 102, south of Interstate 10 N 29 42.495, W 096 28.865 Da l l as Sto u d e n m i r e Dallas Stoudenmire (1845–1882) is said to have looked the part of a lawman. At six feet four inches, he had dark brown hair, green eyes, and the long moustache characteristic of the day. His reputation as a gunfighter grew from his participation in several shoot-outs near Columbus, Texas. When he later traveled west to El Paso, Stoudenmire was hired as city marshal on April 11, 1881. His career as marshal was short, about a year, but eventful. His reputation and ability to outshoot and outdraw anyone looking for trouble had an immediate calming influence on the town. 23\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 24\n\na l l e y to n\n\nGravesite of Dallas Stoudenmire, Alleyton Cemetery, Alleyton.\n\nFour days after assuming office, Stoudenmire was involved in the legendary “Four Dead in Five Seconds” shoot-out.

But as is often the case, those who “live by the gun” eventually “die by the gun,” and Stoudenmire proved no exception. During his tenure a feud developed between Stoudenmire and three brothers, George (Doc), Frank, and James Manning.

But the situation rapidly deteriorated when Doc Manning and Stoudenmire reached for their guns. In the ensuing gunfight Stoudenmire was wounded and fell into a wrestling match in the street with Manning. During the life-or-death struggle, Jim Manning shot and killed Stoudenmire. Both James and Doc Manning went on trial for murder, and each was acquitted in separate trials. The body of Dallas Stoudenmire was returned to Alleyton and was buried in a simple grave surrounded by an ironwork fence. The grave is just inside the gate to the cemetery along its only dirt road.

On August 18, 1882, he married his childhood sweetheart, Mary Gilbert (1862–1951). Bivins moved the family to the Panhandle in 1890 and there acquired his first ranch, the Mulberry Pasture, south of Claude. In the 1920s Bivins was said to be the largest individual cattle owner in the world and the largest landowner west of the Mississippi. At one time he leased or owned more than a million acres of land, and Texas legend has it that he once rode a horse ninety miles from Dalhart to Amarillo without leaving his property. Mrs. Bivins put the family money to many philanthropic uses (including the donation of the family home as a library), public charities, and support for needy families in the area. She actively supported the Amarillo Tuberculosis Association, the School Children’s Relief Fund, and the American Red Cross. Jo h n s o n B l a i r C h e r ry Johnson Blair Cherry (1901–1966) began his football-coaching career in Ranger after graduating from Texas Christian University in 1924. In 1930 Cherry took the job as head coach at Amarillo High School, where his teams won four state championships in seven years. Cherry was hired at the University of Texas in 1937 and served as first assistant on the Longhorn staff for ten years. When Dana X. Bible retired after the 1946 season, Cherry was named head coach. In Cherry’s four years at Texas, he had one Southwest Conference championship and an overall record of 32-10-1. Cherry was voted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1966. Th o m as E .

In January 1934 he helped found the Maverick Club, an organized sports program with a goal of providing boys a place for exercise and learning. In 1939 he founded Cal Farley’s Boys Ranch and soon devoted his full attention to helping homeless and delinquent boys. Farley was a district governor of Rotary International and is in the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame. He was named Outstanding Citizen of Texas and given the Veterans of Foreign Wars Silver Citizenship Medal, the Bronze Keystone Award of the Boys Clubs of America, and an honorary doctor of humanities degree from Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) in 1963. Dutch Mantell Dutch Mantell (1881–1941) was born Alfred Albert Joe de Re la Gardiur, in Diekirch, Luxembourg. Although he began his sports career as a prizefighter, he took up wrestling and became a champion in the sport. He became an American citizen in 1906 and for the next six years toured the nation as a wrestler. From 1913 to 1915 he was a cast member of Hollywood’s Keystone Cops. In 1925 Mantell made Amarillo his permanent home, and there he helped promote the Wun-Stop-Duzzit tire business, which belonged to his close friend Cal Farley. Mantell was the inspiration for Farley’s Flying Dutchman trademark. Although he was a tough—often mean—competitor in the ring, outside the ropes Dutch Mantell was generous and kind to a fault. Much of his fortune was handed over to those in need. After his death, his estate was split between two organizations he had helped build—the Maverick Club in Amarillo and Cal Farley’s Boys Ranch. Au s t i n A . M e r e d i t h Austin A. Meredith (1891–1963) was one of Texas’ most influential water conservationists. As early as 1926, Meredith recognized the need for a water storage reservoir on the Canadian River as a reliable water source for the Panhandle and South Plains areas. Largely as a result of his work, in 1953 the Texas Legislature created the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority. On July 1, 1962, Meredith joined U.S. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall in officially beginning construction of the Sanford Dam on the Canadian River. After his death, Congress named the reservoir formed by the dam “Lake Meredith.” 27\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 28\n\na n d e rs o n Bas c o m N o l l e y Ti m m o n s Bascom Timmons (1890–1987) was born in Collin County, Texas. He developed an interest in politics and national affairs at an early age and was writing newspaper articles by age 18. At the 1912 Democratic National Convention he represented the Washington Post and was the youngest reporter in attendance. Timmons established his own Washington news bureau in the mid-1920s and soon had nationwide distribution of his news reports. Timmons wrote three biographies: Garner of Texas (1948), Portrait of an American: Charles Gates Dawes (1953), and Jesse H. Jones: The Man and the Statesman (1956). Timmons was a lifelong animal lover and had 125 of his cats buried in a cat cemetery in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnderson Odd Fellows Cemetery FM 149, west of Anderson N 30 29.210, W 095 59.840 B e n ja m i n B r i g g s G o o d r i c h Benjamin Briggs Goodrich (1799–1860) studied medicine in Baltimore and practiced throughout the South prior to his 1834 arrival in Texas.

The cemetery is rather unique in that it overlays a dense limestone formation, such that about 75 percent of the gravesites are actually excavated from underlying rock. As a result, it requires about five times as many man-hours to dig a grave in this cemetery as it does in a dirt cemetery. Da n a X . B i b l e Dana X. Bible (1891–1980) came to Texas in 1916 to coach the freshman football team at Texas A&M. In 1917 he was promoted to head coach and won the first of five Southwest Conference championships he would win at the school. In the 1922 Dixie Classic, Bible inadvertently created the famous Texas A&M “Twelfth Man” tradition. Playing heavily favored Centre College, A&M had only eighteen roster players at kickoff. Early in the contest, three Aggies were lost to injury, and the team faced possible forfeiture of the game because of a lack of players. Bible called upon a reserve halfback, E. King Gill (who was in the press box, keeping statistics for the team), to suit up and be ready to play if needed. The Aggies defeated Centre College, and although Gill never took the field, his determination to play if called upon became a legend. In the tradition of the twelfth man, A&M students stand throughout football games to show their willingness to play if needed. Bible left A&M for a stint at the University of Nebraska but soon returned to Texas and assumed the head coaching position at the University of Texas. Bible won Southwest Conference titles in 1943 and 1945, retired from coaching in 1946, and was UT athletic director from 1947 to 1956. Bible was a charter member of the National Football Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1959. 29\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 30\n\nau s t i n B i b b Fa l k Bibb Falk (1899–1989) coached and was the last surviving member of the 1920 White Sox, a team rebuilt after the World Series “Black Sox” gambling scandal destroyed the 1919 team. Falk has the distinction of having been the player who replaced Shoeless Joe Jackson in left field after Jackson was banned from the sport. Falk played for the Chicago White Sox, 1920–1928, and the Cleveland Indians, 1929– 1932. He had a .314 batting average in 1,354 games. In April 1940, Falk assumed the coaching duties of the University of Texas baseball team, leading the Longhorns to the conference championships in 1940 and 1941. At the outbreak of World War II, Falk enlisted in the Army Air Corps and served until his return to the university in 1946. Under his leadership, Texas became the first college team to win back-to-back national championships, in 1949 and 1950. Falk remained at Texas until 1967, compiling a 478–176 record (278–84 in the Southwest Conference), and recorded fifteen outright Southwest Conference championships. He was elected to the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988. Fr a n c i s Au g u s t u s H a m e r Francis A. (Frank) Hamer (1884–1955) was the embodiment of the twentieth-century Texas Ranger. Flinty, tough as nails, and an expert shot, Hamer served two years with the Rangers (1906–1908) and resigned to become marshal of Navasota, a position he held until moving to Harris County in 1911.

Although Frank Hamer’s contributions to law enforcement in the years after he left the Texas-Mexico border were impressive, he is perhaps best known for his role in tracking down the legendary outlaws Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. On February 1, 1934, Hamer was assigned a position as special investigator for the Texas prison system, with the expressed assignment of putting an end to the crime spree of “Bonnie and Clyde.” Relentlessly tracking the pair for months, he set a trap for them near Gibsland, Louisiana, and on May 23, 1934 (with the aid of several other officers), sprung an ambush that ended the crime spree. Hamer’s gravesite is marked by a simple stone in Austin Memorial Park, and he is at rest next to his son Billy Hamer, who as a member of the Third Marine Division was killed in action on the island of Iwo Jima. Ja m e s A . M i c h e n e r James Michener (1907–1997) was one of America’s most prolific and beloved writers. His success began with Tales of the South Pacific, which won the 1948 Pulitzer Prize.

His list of students reads like a who’s who of the golf world, including Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, and six members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall of Fame. His first golf instruction book, Harvey Penick’s Little Red Book (cowritten with Bud Shrake in 1992) became the all-time best-selling sports book, and it remained on the New York Times best-seller list for fifty-four weeks.

After graduation from the University of Texas in 1939, he undertook his acting career in earnest and was soon on Broadway. His first starring role in the movies was in 1944, and he would appear in more than thirty motion pictures during his career. He received an Academy Award nomination for his acting in The Southerner.\n\nHornsby Cemetery FM 969, approximately 1 mile west of FM 973 N 30 15.372, W 097 37.289 Reuben Hornsby Hornsby Bend, also known as Hornsby or Hornsby’s, was named for Reuben Hornsby (1793–1879), who settled there in 1832 and served as postmaster during the Republic of Texas era. The Hornsby Community may be the oldest settlement in Travis County. The Hornsby Cemetery is located near the site of the original home of the Hornsby family and is likely the oldest cemetery in Travis County. It is partially surrounded by a sturdy stone fence, and a Texas historical marker in the cemetery speaks to the fate of Texas Rangers killed by local Indians. Hornsby landed in Texas at Velasco in 1830 and received a grant from Stephen Austin in the new Austin Colony near the present site of Austin. A surveyor by trade, Hornsby selected and surveyed his onelabor headright at Hornsby Bend, east of the Colorado River and 32\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 33\n\nau s t i n\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame legend Rogers Hornsby is at rest in the rustic Hornsby Cemetery, near Austin.\n\nthirty miles north of Bastrop. He occupied this headright in July 1832 and received title on March 4, 1841. At that date, the Hornsby home was the northernmost on the Colorado and was often the target of Indian raids. In June 1836, Indians killed one of Reuben’s sons, Daniel, and a companion while the boys were fishing in the Colorado River. Ro g e rs H o r n s b y Rogers Hornsby (1896–1963) is generally considered the finest righthanded hitter in the history of professional baseball. Called the “Rajah of Swat,” Hornsby began his career in 1915 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in batting seven times and batted over .400 in three seasons. In the years 1921–1925 his batting averages were .397, .401, .384, .424 (a modern record), and .403; a record considered by some as the most extraordinary period of batting greatness in baseball history. Hornsby’s lifetime batting average was .358, the highest in National League history and second only to the .367 of Ty Cobb. Hornsby was named most valuable player of the National League in 1925 and 1929. He managed the St. Louis Cardinals to their first world championship in 1926. In 1942 he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 33\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 34\n\nau s t i n\n\nOakwood Cemetery 1601 Navasota St. N 30 16.586, W 097 43.719 In 1839, as Austin gained favor as the location for the capital of the Republic of Texas, a cemetery was established in what is now the southwest part of the current Oakwood Cemetery. It was not until September 1856 that the cemetery became city property, when the Texas Legislature transferred the tract to the city of Austin. Although the cemetery had a succession of names, it was christened as Oakwood Cemetery in 1912. Temple Beth Israel has provided care of the two Hebrew sections of Oakwood Cemetery since 1876. One is located in the southwest corner of Oakwood; the other (also enclosed) is located on the north side of the tract. Oakwood is acceptably maintained, and the oak, mature cedar, and pecan trees provide lovely shade in the hot Texas summers. The cemetery office is housed in a cut-limestone building located near the cemetery’s center. Oakwood is a large cemetery with interesting gravesites spread throughout. Information concerning gravesite locations can be obtained at the office between about 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. However, if you plan to get information concerning Oakwood Cemetery prior to visiting, you should call the Austin Parks and Recreation Department for contact information. Another great source of information on gravesite locations in Oakwood is contained on microfiche in the Genealogy Collection at the Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives and Library Building, 1201 Brazos Street. Oakwood Cemetery exemplifies the history of Texas perhaps more than any other cemetery in the state, largely as a result of Austin’s role in its exploration and governance. Oakwood also is a testament to the remarkable contribution that Texas’ women have made to the state’s history and heritage. Some of Texas’ most prominent women are at peace in Oakwood, including Annie Webb Blanton, Ima Hogg, and Anna Pennybacker. A random walk through Oakwood in 1995 and the chance discovery of the gravesite of one of Texas’ most famous women provided inspiration for this volume. A small state historical marker located in the south central area of the cemetery indicates the grave of Susanna Dickinson (1814–1883). As I stood facing her gravestone, I wondered how many living Texans knew where this Alamo survivor had finally 34\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 35\n\nau s t i n\n\nGravesite of Susanna Dickinson Hannig, survivor of the Alamo.

Following her husband, Almaron, to the Alamo mission, she and her baby daughter had survived the battle. It was Susanna Dickinson who would deliver the message of defeat to Gen. Sam Houston. She had been swept into history in the blink of an eye, only to settle into Austin and the quiet life of a cabinetmaker’s wife. Although John Wayne immortalized her in a film version of the story of the Alamo, I suspect that the location of her gravesite remains a mystery to most— as it is with many of the old ones. Wi l m e r A l l i s o n Wilmer Allison (1904–1977) began his successful career as a tennis player when he enrolled in the University of Texas in 1925. Allison won the Wimbledon doubles title in 1929 and 1930 (with partner John Van Ryn) and won the U.S. Open Championship in 1935. Allison was elected to the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1957. L au r i n e C . A n d e rs o n Laurine (L. C.) Anderson (1853–1938) received his B.A. from Fisk University and came to Texas in 1879 to assist his brother, E. H. Anderson, at Prairie View Normal Institute (now Prairie View A&M University). L. C. Anderson was the first president of the Colored Teachers State Association. He served as president of the college from 1885 to 1889 and embarked on a personal crusade to improve educational conditions for African-American Texans. Anderson left Prairie View after seventeen years and moved to Austin to serve for thirtytwo years as principal of the school for African Americans that later was named Anderson High School in his honor. Jo h n Ba rc l ay A r m s t ro n g John Barclay Armstrong (1850–1913) was known as “McNelly’s Bulldog.” He arrived in Texas in 1871, and in 1875 he enlisted in the Texas Ranger company led by Capt. Leander McNelly. That same year, he accompanied McNelly to the Rio Grande, quickly rising to the rank of sergeant. When McNelly retired from Ranger service, Armstrong was named second lieutenant of the Special Force of Texas Rangers under 1st Lt. Jesse L. Hall (1877). John B. Armstrong’s most daring act was the capture of gunman John Wesley Hardin. Hardin was wanted for the murder of a Brown County lawman and had fled Texas before he could be arrested. Arm36\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 37\n\nau s t i n strong tracked Hardin to Alabama and then to Florida, where he confronted the outlaw and four of his gang on a train in Pensacola. With lightning-fast reaction, Armstrong shot and killed one of Hardin’s men, struck Hardin unconscious with his pistol, and took the remaining gang members into custody. Armstrong returned Hardin to Texas, where Hardin stood trial and was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. In 1882 Armstrong established the fifty-thousand-acre Armstrong Ranch in Willacy County. Armstrong is a member of the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame. E u g e n e C . Ba r k e r Eugene C. Barker (1874–1956) was born in Walker County, Texas. After his father’s death in 1888, he moved to Palestine, where he worked as a blacksmith during the day and attended school at night. Barker enrolled in the University of Texas in September 1895 and really never left. He received a B.A. degree (1899) and an M.A. (1900) and then served the history department as tutor (1899–1901), instructor (1901–1908), adjunct professor (1908–1911), associate professor (1911–1913), professor (1913–1951), and professor emeritus (1951– 1956). In 1910 Barker assumed the chair of the University of Texas history department, a position he held until 1925. When the title of distinguished professor was inaugurated in 1937, Barker was among the first three professors to be so honored. Barker’s contributions to the understanding and documentation of Texas history were immense. He wrote several volumes on Texas history and served as managing editor of the Southwestern Historical Quarterly and director of the Texas State Historical Association (1910–1937). He was a revered teacher and one of the recognized leaders of the faculty. In 1950 the University of Texas named the Barker Texas History Center in his honor, the first time that such an honor had been bestowed upon a living faculty member. A n n i e We b b B l a n to n A lifelong educator, Annie Webb Blanton (1870–1945) came to Austin in 1888 to teach elementary and secondary school. She attended the University of Texas, supporting herself by teaching, and graduated in 1899. From 1901 to 1908 Blanton taught English at North Texas State Normal College (now the University of North Texas) in Denton, where she became active in the Texas State Teachers Association. In 1916 she was elected as the first female president of the association. 37\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 38\n\nau s t i n In 1918 women obtained the right to vote in Texas primaries, and they immediately began to flex their democratic muscles. The suffragists backed Annie Blanton in a run for state superintendent of public instruction, and in the July 1918 primary, when Texas women exercised their voting rights for the first time, Blanton defeated the incumbent. Her victory in the November general election made her the first woman in Texas elected to statewide office. She served two terms as superintendent and then ran unsuccessfully for Congress. She earned her master’s degree in 1923, taught in the UT education department until 1926, and then took a leave of absence to pursue a Ph.D. from Cornell University. After returning to the University of Texas in 1927, she remained a professor of education there until her death. Annie Blanton published several books during her career and founded the Delta Kappa Gamma Society (an honorary society for women teachers). A l b e rt S i d n e y Bu r l e s o n Albert Sidney Burleson (1863–1937) represented Texas in the Fiftysixth through the Sixty-third U.S. Congresses (1899–1913). Woodrow Wilson appointed him postmaster general in 1913, and he served in that capacity until 1921. During his tenure the post office developed the parcel post and airmail service. Burleson was chairman of the U.S. Telegraph and Telephone Administration in 1918 and chairman of the U.S. Commission to the International Wire Communication Conference in 1920. Oscar B. Colquitt Oscar Branch Colquitt (1861–1940) served as Texas state senator (1895–1899) and succeeded John H. Reagan as state railroad commissioner (1903–1911). He made an unsuccessful run for governor in 1906 but was elected to the office in 1910. After being reelected in 1912, he held the office until 1915. Abner Cook Abner Cook (1814–1884) came to Texas in 1839, just as the republic was beginning construction of its new capital, Austin. In 1847 Cook built a residence for Thomas Ward (commissioner of the General Land Office), the first of many homes and commercial buildings he would design in Austin. Among his many works is the Texas Governor’s Mansion. 38\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 39\n\nau s t i n Jo h n C . D u va l John C. (Texas John) Duval (1816–1897) came to Texas in 1835, where he joined a company organized by his brother Capt. Burr H. Duval to fight in the Texas Revolution. Both John and Burr Duval were with James W. Fannin when he surrendered to Mexican forces. In the Goliad Massacre, Burr Duval was killed, but John escaped. He went on to serve with William A. A. (Bigfoot) Wallace as a member of John C. (Jack) Hays’ company of Texas Rangers (1845) and later served in the Confederate army. In his later years, Duval took up writing and has been called the first Texas “man of letters.” His account of his escape from the Goliad Massacre is a Texas classic. Duval also wrote The Adventures of Bigfoot Wallace, the Texas Ranger and Hunter (1870), and at the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of Fannin’s illfated force. R e b e c c a Ja n e G i l l e l a n d Fi s h e r Rebecca Jane Gilleland Fisher (1831–1926) settled with her family in Refugio County in 1837. In 1840, Comanche Indians attacked the Gilleland home, killed Rebecca’s parents, and took her and her brother, William, as captives. Texas soldiers under the command of Albert Sidney Johnston later rescued the children. Rebecca Gilleland attended Rutersville College from about 1845 to 1848 and married Orceneth Fisher, a Methodist minister. Rebecca Fisher became one of Texas’ most important historian-preservationists. She was a charter member of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and served as its state president for eighteen years. Her portrait was the first of a woman to be hung in the Senate Chamber at the Texas Capitol. G e o r g e Was h i n g to n G l as s c o c k George Washington Glasscock (1810–1868) was born in Hardin County, Kentucky. In 1830 he went to St. Louis, Missouri, and for a period in 1832 partnered with Abraham Lincoln in a flatboating business. In 1835 he moved to Texas and participated in the Siege of Bexar.

He served in Isaac N. Moreland’s company, which operated the Twin Sisters cannons in the Battle of San Jacinto. Green settled in Texas and began a long career in public and military service. He fought in the U.S.-Mexican War in 1846, and after secession in 1861, he was elected colonel in the Fifth Texas Volunteer Cavalry, part of Gen. H. H. Sibley’s brigade. In the spring of 1863 Green commanded the First Cavalry Brigade in Louisiana and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In April 1864 he led a division in successful attacks on federal forces at the Battle of Mansfield and then at the Battle of Pleasant Hill. A few days later, on April 12, 1864, he was killed while leading an attack on federal gunboats patrolling the Red River at Blair’s Landing. Tom Green County was named in his honor. A n d r e w Jac k s o n H a m i lto n Andrew Jackson Hamilton (1815–1875) was educated and admitted to the practice of law in Alabama. In 1846 he came to Texas with his brother Morgan. After practicing law in La Grange and Austin, he was appointed acting attorney general in 1849. Hamilton actively opposed secession, was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1859, and participated on the House committee formed in 1860–1861 to search for a solution to the growing North–South crisis. He returned to Texas in 1861 but left for Mexico in the face of rumored assassination plots. President Abraham Lincoln appointed him military governor of Texas in 1862, and he served as provisional governor for approximately one year (1865–1866). He ran for governor on the Republican ticket in 1869 but lost to Edmund J. Davis. Ja m e s M . H i l l James Hill (1818–1904) came to Texas with his father, Texas patriot Asa Hill, in 1835. After the fall of the Alamo, Hill and his father joined Sam Houston’s army. At San Jacinto, James M. Hill served in Company H of Col. Edward Burleson’s First Regiment, Texas Volunteers. James Hill was one of the those few who witnessed the first postbattle meeting between Houston and Gen. Santa Anna. Hill also appears in William Henry Huddle’s painting The Surrender of Santa Anna, now hanging in the Texas Capitol. Hill joined his two brothers and father in the Somervell Expedi40\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 41\n\nau s t i n tion, continuing on to Mexico with the men of Mier Expedition. All of the family members were captured. His personal reminiscences of the Battle of San Jacinto have become an important part of the historical documentation of the conflict. Ima Hogg Ima Hogg (1882–1975) was the daughter of Governor James Stephen Hogg and was born in Mineola, Texas. As a young woman, she studied music, and although she became an accomplished pianist, Ima Hogg’s contributions to Texas came through her generosity and philanthropy. Her family fortune had gushed from the earth in the form of oil discovered on the Hogg property in Brazoria County. By the 1920s she had begun what would be lifelong devotion to public giving. She founded the Houston Child Guidance Center (1929) and the Hogg Foundation for Mental Hygiene (which later became the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health) at the University of Texas. She was elected to the Houston School Board (1943) and the presidency of the Houston Symphony Society (1946) and in 1948 became the first female president of the Philosophical Society of Texas. In the 1950s Ima Hogg restored the Hogg family home at Varner Plantation near West Columbia, and in 1958 she donated her home to the state of Texas as Varner-Hogg Plantation State Historical Park. She served in a multitude of organizations throughout the rest of her life. In 1969, along with Oveta Culp Hobby and Lady Bird Johnson, she was honored as one of the first three women to be members of the Academy of Texas, which honors persons who “enrich, enlarge, or enlighten” knowledge in any field. Ja m e s St e p h e n H o g g James S. Hogg (1851–1906) was the first governor of Texas born on Texas soil. After studying law, he was elected county attorney of Wood County in 1878 and served as district attorney for the Seventh District (1880–1884). In 1886 he was elected attorney general and became a nineteenth-century consumer advocate. He succeeded in a series of initiatives that returned land holdings to the state, set aside money for schools and institutions, and broke up the Texas Traffic Association (a freighting cartel operating in violation of state law). Hogg recognized the need for a new means of regulating the powerful railroad interests and was a leading proponent of the establishment of the Texas Railroad Commission. Running on that platform, 41\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:21 PM\n\nPage 42\n\nau s t i n he was elected governor in 1891. His tenure in office was marked by his attempts to level the business playing field and to provide secure funding for higher education. After his public service, Hogg returned to private life, where he continued a lucrative law practice and championed progressive reforms. Jim Hogg County was named in his honor. Th e H o l l a n d Fa m i ly Bird Holland (?–1864) came to Texas around 1837 and by 1840 had settled in Travis County. During the U.S.-Mexican War, he was elected captain of a company of volunteers but became seriously ill in Matamoros and resigned his command. After the war, he served as chief clerk and assistant secretary in the State Department. He was appointed secretary of state on March 16, 1861. In all likelihood, Bird Holland was the father of three sons— James, Milton, and William—born as a result of his relationship with a slave named Matilda. William H. Holland (1841–1907) was born into slavery in Marshall in 1841, and his brother Milton (1844–1910, also born into slavery) was born either in Carthage or Austin. At some point in the 1850s Bird Holland apparently purchased the three brothers’ freedom and sent them to Ohio. There both William and Milton attended the Albany Enterprise Academy, a school owned and operated by African Americans. As the Civil War erupted, Bird Holland volunteered for duty in the Confederate army and served as adjutant of Col. Richard B. Hubbard’s Twenty-second Texas Infantry. Two of his sons volunteered for service in the Union army. Milton joined the Fifth United States Colored Troops in Athens, Ohio, in 1863 and fought in the Petersburg campaign in Virginia during 1864 and at Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in January 1865. He rose to the rank of regimental sergeant major. William enlisted in the Union army’s Sixteenth United States Colored Troops. On April 8, 1864, Bird Holland was killed while leading his Confederate regiment at the Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana. Five months later, his son Milton would charge into the history of the Union army. During the night of September 28–29, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler’s Army of the James crossed the James River to assault the Richmond defenses north of the river. The columns attacked at dawn. After initial Union successes at New Market Heights and Fort Harrison, the Confederates rallied and stalled the federal onslaught.

Holland’s troops suffered heavy casualties but won the battle. Although wounded, he led a charge on Fort Harrison later the same day. Milton Holland was cited for his bravery and valor on the battlefields of Virginia and was the first African American born in Texas to win the Congressional Medal of Honor (it is likely that Milton Holland was the first person born on Texas soil to win the Congressional Medal of Honor). After the Civil War, Milton led a prosperous life in Washington, D.C. Milton’s brother William entered Oberlin College in Ohio in 1867 and returned to Texas after two years to teach school in Austin. He later moved to Waller County and in 1876 won election to the Fifteenth Legislature in 1876 as a representative from that county. In the legislature he sponsored the bill providing for Prairie View Normal College (now Prairie View A&M University). William Holland was instrumental in establishing the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youth in 1887, and Governor Lawrence S. Ross appointed him to serve as the institute’s first superintendent. The legacy of the Holland family is one of kindness and service to country and to fellowman. Had Bird Holland not purchased the freedom of his sons, it is unlikely that Milton and William would have enjoyed the opportunities they had as they grew into manhood. The clear irony of the death of Bird Holland in defense of the Confederacy—with its attendant stance on slavery—and the triumph of Milton Holland as he fought to maintain the Union and to deliver all Americans from slavery is one of the most compelling in Texas history. William went on to serve Texas in a series of important roles, and every graduating class at Prairie View A&M speaks to his dedication to the education of African American Texans. Bird Holland was laid to rest next to his wife, Matilda Rust, in Oakwood Cemetery in 1865, and his son William was buried there (next to his mother—also named Matilda) in another section of Oakwood. Milton Holland was honored by burial at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. Jo h n B . Jo n e s Major John B. Jones (1834–1881) was commander of the famous Frontier Battalion of the Texas Rangers. Established by the Fourteenth Legislature, the Frontier Battalion was ordered to end the long history of Indian raids on the frontier and to provide a much needed law enforcement presence in the state. Perhaps Jones’ most famous 44\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:22 PM\n\nPage 45\n\nau s t i n law enforcement episode involved a gunfight in Round Rock that resulted in the death of train robber Sam Bass on July 19, 1878. G e o r g e Was h i n g to n L i t t l e f i e l d George Washington Littlefield (1842–1920) came to Texas in 1850 and grew up on the family plantation in Gonzales County. Littlefield enlisted in the Confederate army and served with Company I, Eighth Texas Cavalry (Terry’s Texas Rangers), which fought in the Army of Tennessee. After the war, he returned to Texas and began a series of business ventures, including his entry into the cattle business. By 1881 Littlefield had become a wealthy man. When George Littlefield moved to Austin in 1883, he was one of the largest landowners in Texas and, upon moving to the capital, he expanded his activities into the banking business. In 1911 Governor Oscar B. Colquitt appointed Littlefield to the Board of Regents of the University of Texas. Over the next decade Littlefield donated generously to the university, providing more money than any other single donor in the first fifty years of the institution. Ja n e M c Ca l l u m Jane McCallum (1877–1957) was born in La Vernia, Texas, and in 1896 married Arthur Newell McCallum, Sr. She settled with her husband in Austin, where he was school superintendent from 1903 to 1942. Jane McCallum jumped into politics as a supporter of prohibition and as a suffragist. In 1915 she was elected president of the Austin Women’s Suffrage Association and soon was a recognized leader in the statewide campaign to secure the vote for Texas’ women. In 1926 she actively campaigned for Daniel J. Moody’s run for the office of governor, and after his election she was appointed secretary of state, a position she held until 1933. After leaving office, she remained active in Austin civic affairs. E l i s h a M a rs h a l l P e as e Elisha Marshall Pease (1812–1883) arrived in Texas in 1835 and immediately became involved in the smoldering Texas Revolution. At Washington-on-the-Brazos in March 1836 he authored part of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. Pease served in a variety of positions in the republic and was the state’s first comptroller of public accounts. After annexation, Pease represented Brazoria County in the first three legislatures and was elected governor in (1853–1857). While in 45\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:22 PM\n\nPage 46\n\nau s t i n office, Pease’s administration established the permanent school fund and supervised the building campaign that led to the completion of the Governor’s Mansion, the General Land Office building, and a new Capitol. O r a n M i l o Ro b e rt s Oran M. Roberts (1815–1898) came to Texas in 1841, where he settled in San Augustine and began a successful law practice. He served as district attorney (1844–1846) and was appointed district judge. After service in the Confederacy, he was appointed chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court in 1864 and served until he was removed along with other state incumbents in 1865. In 1874 he once again began service on the Texas Supreme Court and was chief justice for four years. In 1878 he was elected governor and served two terms. Upon his retirement Roberts was immediately appointed professor of law at the University of Texas, a position he held for the next ten years. Roberts County is named in his honor. Jo h n H . Ro g e rs John H. Rogers (1863–1930) joined the Texas Rangers in 1882, rising to the rank of captain in 1892. During his service he was twice wounded, and as a result of one of the wounds his arm was shortened, after which he carried a specially constructed Winchester rifle. In 1913 President Woodrow Wilson appointed Rogers as U.S. marshal for the Western District of Texas, and he served in that position for eight years. Rogers later served during the tenure of Governor Dan Moody as a Ranger captain (1927–1930). John Rogers is a member of the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame. Ja m e s G i b s o n S w i s h e r James Gibson Swisher (1794–1862) served in the War of 1812 and participated in the Battle of New Orleans. In 1833 he arrived in Texas and settled in Washington County. Swisher was elected captain of a military company organized in Washington Municipality at the beginning of the Texas Revolution. He participated in the Siege of Bexar in December 1835 and was one of the three commissioners to negotiate the surrender of the city on December 11, 1835. Swisher remained with the army until he was elected one of four delegates from Washington Municipality to the Convention of 1836. James Swisher signed the Texas Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. 46\n\n*harvey pages final\n\n9/24/04\n\n3:22 PM\n\nPage 47\n\nau s t i n\n\nBen Thompson was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Austin, after dying in a San Antonio gunfight.\n\nB e n Th o m p s o n Ben Thompson (1842–1884) was born in England and brought to Austin as a child. He became one of Texas’ most notorious gunmen. Thompson served for a period as city marshal of Austin, but his gunplay and love for drink and gambling led to his eventual demise. He was killed along with flamboyant outlaw-turned-lawman John King Fisher in a San Antonio vaudeville theater on March 11, 1884. E l i z a b e t h E l l e n Jo h n s o n Wi l l i a m s Lizzie E.

In 1873 she began teaching from her home and keeping books for prominent cattlemen of the area. An astute businesswoman, she quickly realized the profits to be made in the cattle business. She achieved legendary status as an early Texas “cattle queen” and is thought to be the first woman in Texas to ride the Chisholm Trail with a herd of cattle that she had acquired under her own brand.\n\nTexas State Cemetery 909 Navasota St. N 30 16.016, W 097 43.604 The Texas State Cemetery is located approximately one mile east of the State Capitol between Navasota and Comal streets. General Edward Burleson was the first person buried at the Texas State Cemetery. After his death in 1851, a committee of the Texas House of Representatives convened to plan a funeral, and Andrew Jackson Hamilton provided a parcel of his personal property in east Austin as a state burial ground. The state of Texas assumed ownership of the site in 1854, and from 1856 to 1866, burials of Texas leaders, Civil War generals, and those who had fought for Texas Independence were common. As the 1800s drew to a close, the state of Texas assumed management of the Confederate Men’s and Women’s Home. As the survivors of the Civil War began to pass slowly into history, many of them were buried at the state cemetery. The early part of the twentieth century saw a substantial change in the cemetery. Civil War hero Albert Sidney Johnson was memorialized with a beautiful monument upon which Elizabet Ney carved his likeness. Several of Texas’ most famous and prominent citizens were reinterred at the cemetery, including Stephen F. Austin, Joanna Troutman, and Gen. John Wharton. Between 1929 and 1936 more than seventy Texas notables were brought to the Texas State Cemetery. Many of Texas’ earliest patriots are buried there. Several of those who signed the Texas Declaration of Independence are buried in the state cemetery, including John W. Bunton (1807–1879), William C. Crawford (1804–1895), Richard Ellis (1781–1846), Thomas Jefferson Gazley (1798–1853), Jesse Grimes (1788–1866), Bailey Hardeman (1795–1836), William Menefee (1796–1875), Martin Parmer (1778–1850), Robert Potter (1799–1842), William B.
