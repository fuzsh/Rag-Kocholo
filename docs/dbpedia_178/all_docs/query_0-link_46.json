        "text": "History of Wasco County, Oregon\n\nby Wm. H. McNeal\n\nChapter 1\n\n(approximately 275 pages when printed)\n\nPhotograph titled\n\n\"The Dalles Scene 1858\"\n\nTHE DALLES\n\nTHE DALLES, the city of 14 names and three courthouses, located on the \"bend of the river\" where the amphitheatre walls are mountain high. It is the richest city in history in eastern Oregon. Its name is known far and wherever the Columbia river is mentioned, or any part of the history of the Columbia river gorge or valley is mentioned, The Dalles plays or has played an important part. It is the AND of the Old Oregon Trail. It is the oldest town in eastern Oregon and has 300 days of sunshine. It is 90 miles east of Portland by rail and highway, a hundred miles by water and 30 minutes by air.\n\nWhen the first missionaries, traders and trappers passed by The Dalles the Indians called it WINQUATT, meaning a place encircled by rocks. Lewis & Clark called it FORT ROCK when they camped here in 1805. The Hudson Bay Co. men called it LES GRANDES DALLES, meaning the narrows of the Columbia about 8 miles east of the city where the river \"turns on edge\" and is only 140 feet wide and when the Hudson Bay Co. maintained a trading post here in the 1820's, with James Burnie in charge the Union Jack flew over The Dalles indicating British territory. When the Methodist missionaries occupied the place it was called WASCOPAM after the Wasco Indians who inhabited the city. When the first soldiers occupied the Methodist mission buildings they called it FORT LEE after their Capt. H.A.G. Lee. Next soldiers under Capt. Nathan Olney called it CAMP DRUM (1847) and those of early 1848 called it FORT DRUM and later that same year the soldiers changed the name to FORT WASCOPAM. The military authorities of 1850 called it FORT DALLES and the people of the village at the landing called it FORT DALLES LANDING which name was changed during the next two years to THE DALLES LANDING, the fort retaining the name Ft. Dalles. The post office mail was directed to The Dalles Landing in 1851-52. The post office name was changed in 1853 to WASCOPAM. In 1857 when Wascopam city officially organized a city government they adopted the \"official, legal name of DALLES CITY\" which prevails for legal purposes until this day; but the post office continued to be known as WASCOPAM until 1880 when the official government designation and name was changed to THE DALLES, which name prevails to this date for railroad and postal purposes. The city in 1952 has two names and three courthouses.\n\nThe Dalles has stood at the head of river navigation for over 100 years and has always been a commercially important t rading center for the mid-Columbia area. Before the coming of the white man the Indians recognized its importance as a trading, hunting and fishing center where the Willamettes, Klickitats, Multnomahs, Yakimas, Walls Wallas, Spokanes, Coeur d' Alenes, Umatillas, Cayuses, Warm Springs, Modocks all came here to trade, barter, hunt, fight, hold athletic events with the powerful Wasco tribes. The centers of Indian populations always become centers of the white man's population. The Columbia river was the natural roadway that led all tribes to The Dalles where river obstructions made it impossible to by-pass this place. The Klickitats controlled the Washington side of the river.\n\nAbout 1828 the Hudson Bay Co. post was established at The Dalles to aid their boatmen in getting around the obstructions in the river just east of here, provide a place to rest up and make repairs to equipment. It was in charge of James Burnie and flew the Union Jack to indicate British possession, but Indians resented encroachment and the company gave up the station.\n\nThe METHODIST MISSION AT THE DALLES by Lulu D. Crandall\n\nThe Methodist Mission was established here in 1838. The logs of the mission were felled here with the aid of Indians. The boards for the floors and ceilings were sawed by hand. The shingles were split 12 miles from the mission and brought by pack horses. The main building consisted of one room, later a kitchen and woodhouse was added. It was located about a mile south of the river (at 11 & Washington). The front door of the house opened toward the river, in which direction there was a fine yard with a playground for the children. From the south and of the houses, door opened onto the common promenade. On the opposite side of the square, to the south, stood the church, a plain log building. Near it stood the school house. On the east was the house of H.K.W. Perkins and opposite his residence to the west was the barn and near this the workshop. A shot distance from the square was a spring (on 11 between Washington and Federal). The larger spring to the west (on the high school grounds) was called by the Indians WASCO from which the mission took its name WASCOPAM. The Wasco spring irrigated a garden from which they obtained vegetables, potatoes, corn in season. It was not too thickly wooded about the station. A little further to the west the forest became dense but to the east it disappeared altogether.\n\nThe Indians always thronged the houses, came early and were in no hurry to leave and expected to be treated to something to eat at any time and when no food was given they became morose. It was found necessary to keep the doors closed to get any quiet and rest and even then they would rattle the doors or rap on the windows for admittance. The vicinity abounded with rattlesnakes. They were shot and slow of movement and easily killed, nor was their poison deadly, but the exposure of the children was cause for alarum. The reptiles stayed in the crevices of a large rook nearby and came out in the cool of the evening and would even come into the mission houses. Coyotes were another unwelcome neighbor which came forth of an evening and if pressed for hunger would chase deer into the mission enclosure where the cattle were kept. Their dismal howlings were heard in the distance every evening.\n\nThe station lay on the Old Oregon Trail from the states to the Willamette valley. In 1843 wagons, for the first time, were used through the whole distance to The Dalles. Every year the emigrants came in larger numbers and their demands upon the hospitality of the missionaries became greater. In 1848 the lost Stephen Meek party of 225 wagons, which followed the Meek's cutoff in Central Oregon, lost their way, exhausted their provisions and driven to the necessity of killing their cattle, which were already worn down by labor and disease, bringing on fever, and merry died. Survivors who arrived at the station were subjects of unspeakable distress, hunger and privation, ready to die. Others bore the corpses of deceased relatives or friends to be interred with Christian rights. Many were on beds of sickness and pain.\n\nThe Orphan Indian Boy\n\nWm. McKendus, the little Indian boy who received his name from the Missionaries, lost his parents when he was young. Until he was 12 he lived in the family of his uncle and during this time he became expert in spearing salmon and catching them in a net. He was considered one of the best hunters of his age in the Wascopam tribe. From his 12th year he became a member of the missionary family. He exchanged his Indian dress for the decent clothes afforded him by his teachers. He showed aptness in working in the garden and taking care of cattle on the mission farm. He seemed much pleased with his new life and listened with deep interest to the stories related to him of the states, and he would say, \"it will not be long before I shall see the states.\" He made progress in his learning English and was converted a christian.\n\nIn 1843 when Gen. John C. Freemont and his military explorers stopped for rest and supplies at the Christman spring (15 & Dry Hollow road), after accompanying the first emigrants to Oregon that year under Marcus Whitman's leadership; some of his soldiers left him and he asked for a recruit to guide him through the southern Oregon country and the missionaries recommended the Indian boy who was now 18, active and intelligent. He was given a horse to ride and one to carry his bedding and clothes. He had never had a horse before. His long hours of learning had started to pay off. His long cherished wishes to \"Go back to the states\" was being fulfilled as General Freemont was going to take him to Washington, D.C. He toured California and the eastern states with General Freemont's party, visited Washington, D.C. \"met the great white father in the capitol\"; returned with Freemont to California. All during that time he acquitted himself much to the satisfaction of his employer. He married a Spanish woman in California, retained his Christian habits, came back to The Dalles and was known as \"Billy Chinook\" and died at the Warm Springs Indian reservation in 1894. (Briefly this is just as great a movie story as has ever been shown on the screen to the American public.)\n\nThe mission at The Dalles and Walla Walla and those in the valley were the result of a trip made (see under the White Man's Book of Heaven) by 4 Indian chiefs to St. Louis to ask Gen. Wm. Clark for information about the White Man's Book of Heaven. The story of the Indian's request received much publicity and Daniel Lee, Jason Lee, H.K.W. Perkins and Ben Wright came west in 1834 to establish missions for the Indians. They returned to The Dalles I4r,1¢,1838 to locate the Methodist mission (840 acres) claim and buildings between 10 and 11 and Washington to Federal using the old W.N. Wiley spring for water and gardening on ground now occupied by the high school buildings.\n\nThere were 2000 Indians of the Wasco, Walla Walls, Chinook and Klickitat tribes at or near the mission during the winter of 1839-40 and some of who attended services at Pulpit Rook (11 & Court). The semi-circle of tents of the Indians covered about ½ acre of what we call the football field of the high school grounds below the spring. Rev. Daniel Lee and his wife, H.K.W. Perkins and his wife, H.B. Brewster and wife, Dr. and Mrs. Babcock, Jason Lee and Ben Wright were the occupants of the mission from time to time. The first white child born at The Dalles was a daughter to H.K.W. Perkins born in January 1841. The missionaries taught the Indian agriculture, some 30 sores were in garden and grain. They taught a school for Indian children, cared for some of the sick, had a number of head of horses and cattle, some of which were milk cows, had a workshop for repairs and building purposes, aided the emigrants, operated their own supply line over the Lee Cattle Trail via Lost Lake, Bull Run, Sandy to the Salem area mission. The mission was supplied by wood from the oak and pine trees nearby, the acorns being considered good food which was supplemented by fish, wild game, wild berries and the grain and garden they raised.\n\nIn an interview March 21, 1908 by Mrs. Wentworth Lord, early Dalles Historian, JOSEPH LUXILLO, Yakima Indian Chief told her he had personally heard Rev. Daniel Lee and other Dalles missionaries preach from Pulpit Rock and that he was baptized a Christian in the Wascopam (high school) spring and considered its waters sacred and returned to The Dalles every year he could to drink of the waters of that spring claiming they seemed to give him new life and inspiration and strength. On one of those pilgrimages to The Dalles to drink of the sacred waters of the high school spring, Joseph LuAllo posed for Banjo A. Gifford, internationally famous Dalles photographer, seated on the chair section of Pulpit Rock and faoting the rostra and demonstrating how the missionaries preached to the Indians. This photograph is one of the prized possessions of The Dalles Camera Club, thanks to the thoughtfulness of Mr. Gifford. The Camera Club also has 2 earlier photos of the mission in their collection. The mission was sold in 1847 to Dr. Marcus Whitman of Walls Walla who had plans for moving his mission to The Dalles on account of unfriendly acts of the Indians of that area who finally massacred him and several others of that mission Nov. 29, 1847. The mission buildings were occupied by the soldiers of the Cayuse Indian war of 1848, being abandoned by the missionaries on account of Indian troubles. The buildings were later burned during the Yakima Indian war to keep the Indians from occupying them after Ft. Dalles was built in 1850. In 1880 Dalles City won title to 112 acres of the claim by U.S. Supreme Court test case. So ended the first white settlement in The Dalles. (By E.B. Brewster).\n\nIt was in the dead of winter in 1842 that Dr. Marcus Whitman of the Walla Walla mission went east, after being informed by Elijah White, Indian Agent who escorted 120 emigrants to Oregon that fall, that the Ashburton Treaty with England was to define the Canadian boundary and that 140 Englishmen were bound for Oregon to settle and claim the country for England. Gen. Amos. Lovejoy accompanied White and was well posted on national affairs and after talking the matter over he, Whitman, decided no time could be lost in getting back to Washington to convince Pres. Tyler and Secretary of State Daniel Webster that Oregon should remain American territory. Gen. Lovejoy accompanied Whitman east and at Ft. Hall Capt. Grant tried to impress upon him the hopelessness of trying to cross the Rookies, but Whitman headed for Salt Lake and from there to Santa Fe and St. Louis. Blizzards of the Rockies delayed them almost a month and the crossing of the Grand river, partly froze over with ice almost cost them their lives. At St. Louis Lovejoy remained to recruit the 1843 emigrant party while Whitman went on to Washington to successfully plead the Oregon cause and save the territory from being traded by Daniel Webster for a mess of cod fish; promised to lead emigrants to Oregon as soon as spring weather would permit. President Tyler granted his request to insist on the 48th parallel as the boundary between the U.S. and Canada.\n\nEmigration of 1843\n\nHe returned to St. Louis to find Lovejoy had emigrants waiting at Kansas City, Leavenworth and other points, with their wagons, horses, cattle and families and they started west in June. Dr. Whitman was the real leader of the party, first up in the morning to help and advise, last to go to bed at night after attending to repairs and the sick. At Fort Hall Capt. Grant of the Hudson Bay Co. began at once to tell about the terrors of the mountains ahead and the impossibility of taking wagons any further showing them a corral full to prove his statements. But the emigrants listened to Dr. Whitman who had taken wagons over the route 6 years before and so the 125 wagons, 1000 head of stock and 1000 men, women and children pushed on to Oregon and The Dalles where they built rafts of pine trees and floated their wagons and families down to the Cascades while their stock was driven over the Lee Cattle Trail via Odell, Doe, Band Flat, Archway, Chilwood (Lost) Lake, Bull Run river, Walker's Prairie and Milwaukee or Oregon City. For this accomplishment in saving Oregon for the U.S. and bringing the first emigrants to Oregon and The Dalles, Dr. Marcus Whitman is credited with being another and probably our No. 1 outstanding citizen in our 100 years of history, and the \"father of Oregon and Wasco county\". As stated above Gen. John C. Presmont's military expedition accompanied or followed very closely this first emigration and camped at the Christmas spring at 15 & Dry Hollow road for several days, making repairs, resting and obtaining supplies from Ft. Vancouver so they could go on south through the Warm Springs Indian reservation, Madras, Prineville, Fort Rock, Silver and Summer Lake, Klamath Falls and on to California where he became civil governor, participated in the Mexican war, was U.S. Senator in 1850, was a Civil War veteran, a railroad builder and governor of Arizona (1878-81) and was retired as a mayor general of the U.S. Army in 1880.\n\nIn the fall of 1843 Mr. Joslin, who came west with the Whitman emigration that year built a cabin here of logs and stayed in The Dalles for a while. Down at Champoeg the emigrants established the first Provincial government of Oregon. The missionaries were at the mission up near the present location of the high school and the Hudson Bay Co. fur traders and trappers made their usual trips up and down the Columbia river.\n\n1844\n\nIn 1844 Daniel Wall made an exploratory trip all over eastern Oregon territory, by pack train, for the newly formed provincial government, gathering agricultural and topographical information which would be of value to settlers. The emigration that year through The Dalles was 1500 people and they reported thieving by the Indians.\n\n1845\n\nThe emigration party of 1845 amounted to 3000 and was led by Samuel K. Harlow and Joel Palmer. They were held up so long here awaiting scows, rafts and other means of transportation down the Columbia river that Harlow proceeded to try and find a pass over the Cascades to the Willamette valley. Some of the party explored up the Indian trail up on Dutch Flat but found that an impossible route. Horsemen went up 15 mile and other intervening country only to be stopped by the topography and timber. Indian trails from Tygh, Wamic and that vicinity found a favorable grade but lots of timber. It being just a matter of cutting their way through the timber they started over the decades that fall but were stopped by early snows in Barlow Pass and had to go onto the valley with their stock and what supplies they could carry by pack train method with the intention of returning next spring and finish bridging their wagons over the mountains. During their struggle Joel Palmer climbed Mt: Hood, almost bare-footed, in the, snow to get better views as perspective lay of the country and passes over the mountain. During that winter's session of the Provincial legislature they appealed for permission to build a toll road over the mountains for emigrant foot purposes. After such discussion the permit was granted.\n\nIt was also in 1845 that the lost Stephen Meek train, which suffered as many hardships and deaths as the i11-fated Bonner Party worked its way across the deserts of Central Oregon to the Deschutes and down to about where Sherar's Bridge is, where they ferried with their wagons and stock and came an into The Dalles over the same route Samuel Barlow had that year went out to Tygh Valley over. They got what supplies they could here, buried their dead, treated their sick, abandoned their wagons and most of their stock and refitted down to Vancouver and thence to Oregon City and Milwaukie. (See Meek Train article for more story). As stated above the missionaries at the Methodist mission here gave all the help their limited resources would permit, to these poor unfortunate destitute emigrants of that party.\n\nThe Dalles 1848\n\nThere were 2000 emigrants and their livestock which reached The Dalles that fall. Not all of them had to raft down the Columbia for Samuel K. Barlow, with 50 men, finished cutting a path over the mountains from Wamic to Oregon City. Phillip Foster was a partner in the deal and they operated a toll gate out on Rock creek near Wamic. While the road changed ownership it continued to be operated as a toll road until 1912 when Henry Wymme of Portland obtained it and made it a public road. Later in 1919 George Joseph gave it to the stage of Oregon as a public road. That same year Jesse Applegate founded his southern Oregon pass over the Cascades to the valley.\n\nThe Dalles in 1847\n\nThe Indians were getting a little more hostile toward the whites and the Methodist mission at The Dalles was abandoned by its occupants who went to the Willamette valley mission where there was more protection from Indians; and the mission buildings and claim was sold to Dr. Marcus Whitman of Walla Walla who intended to wind up his affairs there in the spring of 1848 and move his activities to The Dalles. He put his nephew Perrin Whitman in charge here. Then on Nov. 29, 1847 Dr. Marcus Whitman, his wife and 9 others were massacred by the Cayuse Indians at their mission house at Walla Walla. The Catholic Priests at the nearby Catholic mission made the first report of the massacre to the Hudson Bay post at Wallula and they rushed messengers down the Columbia to inform Dr. McLaughlin at Vancouver. They informed Perrin Whitman of the massacre and he fled to the valley for protection. The word spread to the settlers at Oregon City and they immediately held a legislative session, organized a \"state army\" under General Joel Palmer and Col. J.W. Nesmith to protect the people from the Indians. A company of 40 riflemen under Maj. H.A.G. Lee arrived at The Dalles by Christmas and occupied the Methodist mission buildings as Fort Lee; forbid all Indian gatherings; forbid any white settlement; forbid Father Rosseau and Bishop Blanchet from establishing their Catholic mission here and proceeded to roundup the unfriendly Indians. There were only a few emigrants of 1847, probably less than 1000, but it was these emigrants who had measles in their party as they passed the Walla Walla mission, and the Indians who could not be kept away from the wagons, got the measles and carried the disease to their families wiping out hundreds of them. All they thought of was \"revenge against the whites\", and despite the fact the white children of the Walla Walla mission had the measles too and the fact Dr. Whitman was administering to all alike, they took their revenge out on him, the best friend both the Indians and the white man ever had in the Pacific northwest.\n\nThe Dalles in 1848\n\nThe Dalles in 1848 was the headquarters for the Cayuse Indian Jar campaign against the unfriendly Indians of the Walls Walla area and the roving bands between here and there. There were several mounted companies under Col. Wm. Gilliam and Col. J. W. Nesmith, Capt. Nathan Olney of The Dalles. Joe Meek, \"ambassador from Oregon\" to Washington, D.C. accompanied the soldiers to Walla Walla to get first hand information so as to complete his request to Washington for federal troops to protect the people from the Indians. During the Campaign the Cayuse Indians were destroyed as a nation; the unfriendly Indians between here and Walla Walla were wiped out and safety restored. There was no emigration that year on account of Indian trouble. The construction on the Catholic mission buildings here at the Wasco county hospital grounds proceeded under Bishop Blanchet and Father Rosseau. They built 2 cabins and a log church near the county spring and held services for the Indians. In 1848 Nathan Olney, who had came to The Dalles early that year in charge of (Capt.) a company of soldiers, established his log trading store on the banks of Mill creek near First street. He was the first permanent resident of The Dalles and the first merchant and figured prominently in all the affairs of the community (1847-1887) and is therefore to be rated as one of the most outstanding men in the history of our community and county. He did a good business here and later when Ft. Dalles military authorities made him move out of town he established another store on the banks of Olney (Chenowith) creek about where highway 30 crosses and continued to do a good business with emigrants, soldiers and early settlers or travelers. The people in those days arrived here starved for fresh meat and garden produce and other supplies which were running low by the time they got to The Dalles.\n\nRafting Down the Columbia\n\nIf emigrants chose to go down the river by raft the logs were out within the present city limits of The Dalles, hauled to Chenowith creek where they were assembled into rafts of various sizes, depending upon the number of wagons to be loaded on one. The mouth of Chenowith creek was not only a protected place but it was easier to work at and easier to load wagons. Also there was an abundance of fish and fresh water mussels to be had to satisfy starving appetites. Rafts were poled out of the mouth of the creek into the Columbia river where they were floated down to the Cascades, being steered by long oars. They had to be unloaded there and the rafts let down over the rapids with ropes and floated to re-loading locations below North Bonneville; and the wagons pulled down the 4 miles or so over a rough twisty road for re-loading and floating to Vancouver where Indians were hired to help propel them up the Willamette to Milwaukee, the first settlement. Roads led from there to Oregon City and other valley points. There were Indians and early rivermen who made it a business to barge wagons down to the upper Cascades and others took them on down from North Bonneville. Sometimes wagons were abandoned here, the women and children taken down in \"dug-out canoes\" by the Indians or rivermen and the stock driven down and supplies packed on the backs of stock. Others, of course, took the old Barlow road. It was so steep going down Laarbl hill that the wagons had to be let down by ropes tied around trees, or by dragging logs and locking the wheels. No matter which method was chosen it was a hard trip from The Dalles on down to the Willamette valley points.\n\nThe Dalles in 1849\n\nCol. W.W. Loring arrived in The Dalles in 1849 with 6CO riflemen, 160 wagons, horses, teamsters, scouts and military equipment. As he came west he left soldiers at Ft. Laramie, Fort Hall (Idaho) then a part of Wasco county (1854). He left Major Tucker here at The Dalles with 2 companies of men. The whole expedition was ragged, hungry, worn out and exhausted and starving upon arrival here and they occupied the Methodist mission buildings which they called Fort Drum. Col. Loring went on down to Oregon City for the winter. An estimated 2000 emigrants passed throw The Dalles that year and 20,000 are credited with heading for the gold fields of California, turning off at Fort Hall.\n\nThe Dalles in 1850\n\nIn the spring of 1850 Maj. S.S. Tucker proclaimed Fort Dalles Military reservation to be 10 square miles, and denied settler's rights to emigrants within the reservation. Nathan Olney was therefore forced my Maj. Tucker to move his store to Chonowith creek. Maj. Tucker started construction of the log Fort buildings at Fort Dalles and when they were completed for occupancy he ordered the Methodist missior1 buildings burned. Maj. Tucker named the Fort \"Fort Dalles\". It is interesting to note that Col. (later General) B.S.L. Bonneville, after whom Bonneville Dam is named, and who had made 2 trips out to the Oregon country, is credited with suggesting to the military authorities that a military post be established at The Dalles due to the strategic location of this place and being at the head of river navigation and also on and at the and of the emigrant road which needed protection. The Dalles should be the supply station for all other military posts established in eastern Oregon territory, he pointed out. He had came west in 1832 and again in 1837 and was better able to judge the needs of the region than any other military man. He was put in command of the 4th U.S. Infantry after the establishment of Fort Dalles and Fort Vancouver. Col. W.W. Loring's men were recruited at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan. and given some very intensive drilling preparatory to the 2000 mile trip west with the 600 men, 31 officers their wives and children, 160 wagons and 700 horses and while they arrived at The Dalles in a hungry, ragged and barefooted condition, horses too weak to carry their burdens, yet they accomplished their task of establishing forts for protection of emigrants, just as Joe Meek had requested the government on behalf of the Oregon Provincial government. Justin Chenowith came west in the military party of 1849. In 1850 several trains of emigrants arrived, like the soldiers the year before, in a starving; and ragged condition and Maj. Tucker outfitted them free with flour, salt pork, rice, beans etc. from the Fort Dalles commissary. John Bell operated a sutlers store at the fort garrison and he sold out to Wm. Gibson, the next year (1851) who moved the store down closer to the boat landing, in a log building at first and Union formerly occupied by Nathan Olney. Dr Allen Steel was post surgeon. W. C. Laughlin, Henry Williams (8 Mile creek) and S.L. Brooks were among the 1850 carpenters who aided in erecting the LOG BUILDINGS of Old Fort Dalles in 1850 and they received $10 a day wages ($50 in 1952 values) and the buildings were reported to have cost $80,000 each. The long officers barracks on 18 street faced north, there was the main soldier's barracks at 9 & Mt. Hood, there was a store house, guard house, sawmill, mess house at 9 & Mt. Hood, commanding officer's quarters and stables and corrals. W.D. Biglow also came west with the 4th Inf.\n\nCol. B.E.L. Bonneville was born in France (1795), was a graduate of West Point (1815) and in 1832 made his first expedition west and again came west in 1837. He was a Mexican war veteran and retired on disability in 1881. He was in command of the 4th U.S. Infantry at Vancouver when Gen. U.S. Grant was his quartermaster.\n\nCol. W.W. Loring was born in N.C. and served in the Mexican war where he lost an arm at Mexico City. During the Civil war he served under General Lee for the Confederate states. After the war he went to Egypt and was made Chief of Staff of the Khedive and was known as Loring Boy, soldier of fortune in the Turkish army. He wore a fez and was a factor in the statesmanship of Turkey. He wrote \"The Story of a Confederate Soldier!\" about his own life and died in 1868.\n\nCOVERED WAGON SERIES by Lulu D. Crandall\n\nIt was May 13, 1850 that Col. Loring, carrying out Gen. P.F. Smith's orders to establish garrisons along the Old Oregon Trail, sent 2 companies of rifle regiments to The Dalles to locate a supply post, for posts east of here to be supplied by teams and wagons. Capt. Clairborne was detailed for this purpose and with him were Lt. May and Lt. Ervine and his surgeon was C.H. Smith. The troops set about erecting buildings out of logs. The headquarters building was a long building of logs with a number of rooms, one after another opening out on a common veranda and looking north. The building was always called the \"log barracks\" and was used as officers quarters. It stood on 15 & 16 between Trevitt and Bridge. There was also a store house; a guard house, a sawmill, a mess house, a commanding officers house and quarters for the men, they occupied the flat along 9 street to Mt. Hood with endless corrals for hundreds of government mules and cavalry horses. There was a wagon shop, a saddle shop, a blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop. The sawmill was built on 9 & Mill creek from which the creek took its name and it stood on the north side of 9 street bridge. There is a pathetic story connected with it.\n\nMajor Tucker had orders to build a sawmill at Ft. Dalles to be operated by mule power. His men working on the fort argued that his superior officers were not familiar with the availability of the water-power so he built the better water power mill and was court martialed for disobeying orders, found guilty and dishonorably discharged, from the army. He felt the humiliation and disgrace keenly, went to California where he died of a broken heart in a few years. In 1860, the DONATION LAND CLAIM ACT was, passed by congress Sept. 27 giving married men 640 acres. The law expired Dec. 1, 1855. All Donation Land Claimants were first citizens of Wasco county. In 1850 the BRIDGE OF THE GODS book was written by Fredrick Homer Balch, first author of Wasco county and its most outstanding writer. It was a \"best seller\" with 27 editions. There has been no story that has came out of the west that comes anywhere near the popularity of the Bridge of the Gods.\n\nEdward Crate settled at Crates Point, on his Donation Land Claim.\n\nThe Dalles in 1851-52\n\nThe POST OFFICE at The Dalles Landing was established November 5, 1661 by Nathaniel Coe, territorial postmaster for Oregon and he appointed William Gibson, keeper of the sutlers store at the Landing here a postmaster. This makes the post office the oldest business institution in The Dalles and in existence more than 100 years! As stated above Wm. Gibson's sutlers store was located on the bank of Mill creek at First and Union in Nathan Olney's log store building. Justin Chenowith, after whom Chenowith creek was named, was given the contract by Capt. Nathaniel Coe for transporting the mails from the Cascades to Fort Dalles Landing. He used a sail boat, Indian dug-out canoe with husky Indian paddlers for assistants on days when the wind was not favorable for sails. Wm. Gibson sold his store to Victor Trevitt who moved the building to his property at the north-west corner of And & Union, across from the present post office building. The military authorities relaxed their restrictions against settlement. This allowed Allen & McKinley to establish their store at First & Court with Perrin Whitman in charge. Henry Chase established a store which he sold to John Simms. W. C. Laughlin located his home at the foot of Laughlin street where the Stadelman Ice plant is now located. The Dalles Hotel was established by Mr. Tompkins; W.D. Biglow established a store in a tent and Milo M. Cushing operated a store axed hotel.\n\nTHE DALLES IN THE 1850's by Elizabeth Laughlin\n\nElizabeth Laughlin (Mrs. Wentworth Lord) in her REMINISCENCE, (THE FIRST HISTORY OF THE DALLES) published at the turn of the century, we quote as follows: \"My father, William C. Laughlin, and my mother (Mary Yeargin Laughlin) came to The Dalles by oxteam in 1850. The garrison buildings consisted of 6 logs houses. The soldiers were housed in tents. There were 100 men working at the mill (9th & Mill creek) and on the fort buildings that winter. The pine trees upon the hill were just small bushes in those days and a wagon could drive over any of them. Nathan Olney had a store on Olney (Chenowith) creek and father erected a log house, with the help of mother, near Olney's store and lived in it that first winter. It didn't even have a floor in it, except for the good old mother earth. We were so poor that mother made shirts out of canvass wagon covers. Salt was sold by Olney for 12¢ a pound. When we ran out of money, flour and other food mother stewed birds to eat! Occasionally we could trade a little work for some flour with John Bell at the fort. Father worked in the government sawmill (at 9 & Mill creek). We had a cow and sold milk to the soldiers at the fort. Mother made gloves for the soldiers out of buckskin. She remodeled officers uniforms to help make a living.\n\n\"In 1851, when the soldiers left the fort, we lived in one of the fort cabins which had a dirt floor. Later we moved into a cabin across Mill creek from the fort and then we moved back to the fort where mother cooked for the men and lived there. We accumulated a small herd of beef and sold fresh meat to the emigrants that fall. The emigrants would abandon their poor, weak, thin animals here and father would buy them and pasture them out until by next year they shapened into good animals that either could be worked or eaten. He got them cheap and sold them at good prices. We also sold pickles, butter, eggs and garden stuff to the emigrants who were almost wild to get some 'real American food' after 6 months of dried foods.\n\n\"In 1852 we started a store at FAIRBANKS (on lower 15 mile) with Frank Camp, selling beef, flour, dried fruit, cakes, bread, pickles, coffee, tea, candy; or traded them for horses and cattle so that by fall we had 100 head of cattle and 100 horses which increased to 400 by winter. That fall we went to Hood River with Dr. Farnsworth and lost nearly all our livestock by the deep snow and cold winter down there. We only had 14 head of cattle and 17 horses left out of 4001 We came back to The Dalles in 1853 to stay and by that time there ware several houses erected in town, called The Dalles Landing. It was a regular city of tents here then. We were so poor in 1853 we lived in a tent down by the river. In 1654 N.H. Gates built his hotel; Lt. Forsythe built the pioneer hotel; A.H. Curtiss built a hotel; Mr. Martin built the Oregon House and 2nd & Washington and sold it to father in 1880. Louis Eppinger built to Occidental hotel.\n\n\"In 1850 The Dalles was dominated by gamblers and the tough element. First and Washington was the main business corner of the town. Fort Dalles was then being built of logs. Henry Williams (of 8 mile) S.L. Brooks and father were among the carpenters who erected the buildings of the log fort. Witness Tree marked the center of the Military Reservation, which was 5 miles in all 4 directions from that tree, located on Mt. Hood street between 12 & 13. The selection was made by Maj. S.S. Tucker in May of 1850. The location of Witness Tree was painted out by C.W. Denton, 1854 Nurseryman of Mill Creek to members of Fort Dalles Historical Society in 1906. In 1852 Capt. Bend. Alvord arrives at Fort Dalles with several companies of U.S. Infantrymen. In 1853 the Military Reservation was cut down to one square mile permitting settlement of The Dalles Landing and Jonas Mosier erected many of the dwellings and business buildings.\"\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1850 by J.W. Covington\n\n\"The Dalles Landing is a desolate location of 100 abandoned emigrant wagons and starved cattle roaming about the flats and hill sides. There was only one cabin in The Dalles at that time, located on the bank of Mill creek and used by Nathan Olney, who came there in 1848, as a combination store and dwelling.\"\n\n1852 was the year of the BIG EMIGRATION when 18,000 people were credited by historians as passing through The Dalles and many of them remained or returned to The Dalles to make their homes.\n\nThe side wheel steamer FLINT was built here in 1851 and taken to Portland for the passenger trade in 1852; and Nathan Olney that year (1852) established a ferry at the mouth of the Deschutes. The winter of 1852 was so severe that Edward Crate lost nearly a11 his stock at Crate's point.\n\nThe Dallas in 1853\n\nIn 1853 the Military Reservation was cut down to one square mile. Emigrants were allowed to settle at the Landing. Jonas Mosier, after whom the city of Mosier was named, built many of the dwellings and business establishments becoming the first contractor of The Dallas. Nathan Olney sold his Chenowith store to Dr. C.W. Shaug, one of the earliest family physicians of The Dalles and Justice of the Peace when The Dalles was a part of Clackamas county and owner of the George Snipes farm, after whom Snipes acres was named; and went to the mouth of the Deschutes to establish a ferry to help emigrants cross that stream. After about 4 years he sold his ferry and farmed near the mouth of 5 mile creek. The emigration that passed through The Dalles that year was estimated to be 8000. The steamer Allen of Allen & McKinley Co. operated from The Dallas to the Cascades hauling mail, passengers and freight. C.W. Denton settled on his Donation land claim on Mill creek on property now owned by the Neilsen Bros. where he established the first nursery in the county. In his place was \"treaty oak\" under which the Indian treaty of 1855 was signed by the Indians and Joel Palmer, Supt. of Indian affairs for the government. On Sept. 5, 1853 the name of the city was changed to WASCOPAM and remained known as Wascopam until March 22, 1860 altho the fort remained known as Fort Dalles. In the latter part of 1853 when the talk began to get strong for creating a separate county east of the Cascades with WASCOPAM the county seat, Major Gabriel J. Rains, in charge of Fort Dalles, was \"opposed to extending the newly proposed county boundaries from the summit of the Cascades to the summit of the Rookies and from the Columbia river to the boundary of California, for the reason that it was too large in size and because there were only 35 white people within its borders.\"\n\nThe above is a much quoted statement made by Major Rains when he came to Fort Dalles with 2 companies of soldiers in 1855. It is often that politicians and military men make \"political statements\" in opposition to movements that exaggerate the truth. The following is a list of 1854 known First Families of Wasco County when it was created January 11. The initials DLC indicate Donation Land Claimants who had to file on their claims between 1850 and 1855, nearly all of whom were married and obtained the full 640 acres:\n\nDaniel Bolton DLC; W.G. Biglow DLC; J.M. Bird; John Bell, sutler; John Booth, saddler; A.D. Bolton; Justin Chenowith DLC; Edw. Crate DLC; Catholic Mission DLC; Father Mesplie; T. Mesplie DLC; Lafayette Calwell DLC; Mr. Chase; M.M. Cushing, merchant; Nathaniel Coe DLC; James Benson DLC; Frank Camp, merchant; A.H. Curtiss, hotelman; S.L. Brooks, carpenter; J.W. Covington; P. Craig, druggist; Daniel Butler DLC; Chas. Denton DLC; J. Doherty, merchant; W.L. DeMoss, baker; Louis Eppinger; Lt. B.M. Forsythe, hotelman; W.C. Fauntelory; Mr. Foreman, blacksmith; Dr. Farnsworth; N.H. Gates, hotelman; Wm. Gibson, merchant; J.C. Gore; Rev. James Garrish; John Halligan DLC; L.R. Henderson DLC Dufur; Orlando Humason, father of Wasco Co.; J.L. Henderson, merchant; John Irvine DLC; H.P. Issac, merchant; Jacob Juker, merchant; Rev. Jenkins; Warren Keith; Wm. C. Laughlin DLC; Talbot Lowe DLC; Dr. Wm. Logan; Nathan Morris DLC; Josiah Marsh DLC; Josiah Mosier DLC; Richard Marshall DLC; Mr. Martin; W.C. Moody, first jailer; C.R. Meigs, first recorder; Capt. Issac Mc Farland; John F. Noble; Nathan Olney, first merchant; Orville Olney; Wm. Olney; Peter Rudie DLC; Dr. C.W. Shaug DLC; John A. Simm DLC; Geo. Snipes DLC; Victor Trevitt DLC; John Thompkins; Capt. R.R. Thompson DLC Thompson Addition; Perrin Whitman, clerk; Henry Williams, homesteader on 8 mile; W.C. Wallace, contractor; H.J. Waldron, druggist; Louis Eppinger, hotelman; W.C. Moody, warehouse; a total of some 60 names of heads of families, which, together with their wives and children would account for about 200 people. One of the early directories credited Wascopam as having a population of 300 in 1854 and this latter figure is probably much closer to the actual number of people here than the 35 figure Maj. Rains is credited with claiming. The further fact that Orlando Humason, Clackamas County legislator who lived in The Dallas and sponsored the bill creating Wasco county, didn't seem to have any trouble in getting his bill passed, would be a good indication that the legislative politicians didn't take very serious the claim that only 35 white people lived in Wasco county.\n\nWASCOPAM in 1854\n\nMaj. Granville O. Halter came to Fort Dallas with one company of man in 1854 relieving Maj. Rains. The Ward emigrant train massacre near Ft. Boise in August drew Maj. Fuller to that area with half his men and a few additional volunteers but the Indian had f1ed, and it was not until 1855 that scout troops took and hung the murderers responsible for the massacre, under command of Maj. Fitzgerald, who was in charge of Fort Dalles in 1855. The \"township act\" was passed by Congress authorizing the legal laying out of cities altho cities could be platted under the act of May 23, 1844. Orlando Humason, the Father of Wasco County introduced his bill in the Oregon legislature to create Wasco county. As stated above he was a representative of Clackamas county but lived in Wascopam. The bill was adopted January 11, 1854. Scholl & Noble started a sawmill on Mill Creek at the Urquert place, about 3 miles up the creek at the first bridge, to saw lumber for Fort Dallas and Wascopam houses and business buildings, sheds, barns and the like. The steamer MARY was built at the Cascades for trade between there and The Dalles (Wascopam). Passengers in those days had to stay all night at the Cascades, on the trip in each direction. John Simms was first county sheriff, Geo. Snipes was Court Crier and Justin Chenowith was first county judge. WASCOPAM was platted as a town and the year 1854 MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE CITY as well as the county, many historians have claimed. There seems to have been enough people here and enough business activity to advance that date to 1852 as the \"beginning of the city\".\n\nPhotographs titled\n\n\"Flood - 1894\"\n\n\"Freighting in 1890's\"\n\nWASCOPAM 1855\n\nJoel Palmer, government Indian agent, made the much publicized treaty of 1855 with the Indians under the Charter Oak on the Denton (Neilsen) place up Mill creek. This treaty provided for the Warm Springs Indian Reservation of 464,000 acres, provided that Indians could hunt and fish in their \"usual and accustomed places\" and forbid white men from trespassing upon their lands, provided for schools, and Indian agent and other provisions. The Donation Land Claim Act expired December 1 1855. It was adopted Sept. 27, 1850. All Wasco County Donation land claims, on file in the Wasco county assessor's office had to be filed on between those dates. While the Indians on the Oregon side of the Columbia river accepted the terms of the Treaty of 1855 those on the Washington side were not ready to submit to being placed on reservations and having all their other lands taken by the white man without fighting for their homes. The powerful Klickitat Indians especially prided their freedom. They were known to hunt on the plains, east of the Rocky mountains, for buffalo hides which were highly prized; and early miners relate about meeting them in the gold fields of California. They traveled widely for Indians of that time and had lots of friends in other tribes who felt as they did about the white man's encroachment and spent much of the year of 1855 preparing to resist the white man. Things came to a head that fall when they murdered A.J. Bolan, Indian Agent, on the Washington side of the river almost within sight of The Dalles while on a peaceful mission. A friendly Deschutes Indian, sent into the country to find out why Bolan had not returned found that he was murdered and that the powerful Klickitat, Yakimas and Walla Wallas were all united for action.\n\nTHE DALLES CO. B. OREGON MOUNTED VOLUNTEERS\n\nIn Sept. 1855 that Major Gabriel J. Rains ordered Major Granville O. Haller, also stationed at Fort Dalles, with a company of 150 men mounted, into the Yakima country to punish the Indians and find the murders of Bolan. The met the Indian on Oct. 6, 1500 strong. Out-numbered 10 to one they fought all that day and night and all the next day and night when they dispatched a messenger to Fort Dalles for re-enforcements. On the evening of the 3rd day they turned their extra stock loose and prepare for a night retreat. They built fires to keep from being separated and the Indians put up an all night running fight with them to within 25 miles of The Dalles (Wascopam) where they met Lt. Day with 45 men of the 3rd artillery. Haller reported 5 men killed and the loss of practically all his horses and supplies. Haller called for 1000 men but was given only 319 under Capt, Fitzgerald who took charge of Ft. Dalles. The governors of Oregon and Washington made calls for volunteers and The Dalles (Wascopam) organized Co. B. Oregon Mounted Volunteers under Capt. Orlando Humason, the Father of Wasco county, October 11, 1855. Joel Palmer was General and J.W. Nesmith was Colonel. We are going to give the list of names of this company here because these men, most of them at least, were \"first citizens\" of The Dalles and Wasco county at that time, further refuting Maj. Rains credited statement, \"that there were only 35-white people in Wasco county in 1854\":\n\nJohn T. Jeffers, 1st Lt.; James McAuliff, 2nd Lt.; Jerrmah E Dennis, Serg.; Tom Martin, Serg., B.F.

They were called into the service by Proclamation of the governor of Oregon Oct. 11, 1855 and served from the 20th of Oct. 1855 to May 19, 1856.\n\nThe following Dalles men served in Capt. Benj. F. Burche's Co. B. under Col. Thomas R. Cornelius called into the service by Proclamation Jan. l6, 1856 to serve until May 8, 1856, the original co. being from Salem: - John W.

Rexford, John Brownlee, Richard Fry, James Houston, Thomas B. Haller, Wm. L. Kendall, James W. Kelley, James B. Morgan, Arthur F. McBride, Thomas B. Mitchell, Oliver Price, Josiah B. Smith, Silas B. Story, Casper Snook, Hiram Wood, Abel White, Jarrett Walker.\n\nMaj. Gabriel J. Rains was in charge of the Yakima Indian war campaign and Col. Geo. W. Wright of Ft. Dalles commanded the entire expedition. Col, Wright's tactics were to kill all Indian horses leaving them dismounted so they couldn't fight; and to starve them into submission by not allowing them to either fish or hunt, raise wheat or other crops or livestock. Capt. Orlando Humason's Dalles company fought in the Walla Walla campaign, going up there on the 24th of Nov. under Col. J.W. Nesmith. Nathan Olney of The Dalles went along as Indian agent. They were reinforced at Umatilla in Dec. by Col. Kelley and 350 men. There was snow on the ground and the weather was very cold causing much suffering among the men.\n\nWASCOPAM (The Dalles) 1856\n\nThe Dalles company found Ft. Walla Walla (Wallula) burned. Enroute to Walla Walla they met Pan Pan Mox Mox the Indian Chief and several of his followers who were made prisoners. They encountered the main body of 1000 Indians and had a running fight with them to the Whitman Mission. The prisoners tried to escape and were shot to death and different parts of the Chief's booty was taken by the soldiers as trophies of war: The Indians were estimated to have lost 100 men while 24 soldiers were thinned from the military ranks in a 3 day battle. The winter spent at Walla Walla was very severe, like, that at Valley Forge, the temperature at times being 20 below and lots of snow and clothing, shoes and blankets scarce. The feet of many of the boys were frozen. Horse meat that winter at Walla Walla was called \"Cayuse Beef\". When the weather opened in February the troops pushed on into the Paluse country.\n\nIn April as Capt. Cornelius was leaving Ft. Dalles for Walla Walla. The Indians stampeded his horses leaving the command dismounted near the forks of 15 and 8 mile creeks. Two companies were sent to Tygh where they had a skirmish with the Indians near the Devil's Half Acre. Col. Wright had closed the Columbia river from Indian fishing, closed the Yakima river also; built a blockhouse at the Cascades to keep the river open for traffic and built a portage road of wooden rails to step up movement of supplies. Horses and mules were used for motive power on the Washington side of the river. This blockhouse and settlement was attacked in March 1856 and several lives were lost in a massacre. The steamer Mary hurried to The Dalles for military aid and Col. Wright took 250 men down on the Mary March 28. The Bells and Fashion brought 100 men from Portland and Vancouver. The Indians scattered.\n\nCol. Wright finally was able to push on to Walls Walla on the 6th of May and by the 27th had chased all the Indians into the Yakima country where he killed 800 of their horses, prevented them from hunting or gathering any food or fishing thus starving them into submission on Indian reservations. Mayor Layton did the same thing on the Oregon side killing some 900 horses for Indians, took their supplies and forced 1000 Wasco, Tygh, Deschutes and John Day Indians in to the Warm Springs reservation. By August of 1856 the Yakima Indian war was over.\n\nFORT DALLES IN 1856\n\nThe military garrison at Fort Dalles was strengthened that fall under Col. George Wright with 3 companies of the 9 U.S. Infantry. Steps were taken to replace the old log Fort Dalles buildings with more modern saved lumber buildings and for the next 2 or 3 years a rebuilding expansion program was laid out with Capt. Thomas Jordan in charge and Louis Scholl the architect. He was born at Calsroke, Germany, educated at Lyceum as an architect and apprenticed in wood and iron work. He came to America in 1848. His plans for the post buildings, \"the like of which did not exist at any other army post\", Mrs. Crandall writes, \"the buildings were in a semi-circle, looking toward the river, and consisted of the commanding officer's quarters (occupied by Col. Wright); the surgeons quarters (Ft. Dalles Historical Building) on the left; further to the left were quarters for the noncommissioned officers; to the right of Col. Wright's quarters was Capt. Thomas Jordan's quarters and the commissary. The band stand and the flag pole of the parade grounds is the same as the; playgrounds of the Col. Wright school and its flag pole. The Guard house was just west and down 14 street from the Col. Wright school. The stables were on 11 & Mt. Hood while corrals for hundreds of horses and government mules occupied practically all the rest of the ground down to 9th street. There was the saddlery, carpenter shop, wagon shop, blacksmith shop, bakery, hospital, main barracks buildings far, both the cavalry and the infantry with cook houses in the rear of each.\"\n\n\"The cost of the fort buildings ran from $5000 for the smaller ones to $22,000 for the barracks and up to $90,000 for Col. Wright's quarters which had a fireplace in every room. The carpenter work was all done by hand! according to an article published in 1915 by Roxa Shackelford, president of the local Ft. Dalles Historical Society; \"well seasoned materials was used, 2 year time was required for completion of the fort. Col. Wright's quarters had oak sideboards, wardrobes and mantle pieces and it was destroyed by fire Dec. 24, 1888.\n\nCarpenters were paid $10 a day, owing to demand for labor in the mines. It was estimated that the total cost run about 1 million dollars. The fort was established May 13, 1850 as a guard to the emigrant road. First built of log buildings that were replaced in 1856 for more adequate ones to handle the business of supplying outlaying forts, guarding emigrant trails, surveying public lands, protecting emigrants, prospectors and miners from the Indians. All expeditions into the wilderness of eastern Oregon and Washington had to be outfitted at Fort Dalles. New posts and forts had to be established and maintained in the Indian country and mining districts. All traffic in those days were by oxen, mules, horses, wagon's and pack trains. The government mule in those days was a respectable animal worth lots of money. Large stables and corrals were necessary. The blacksmith shop, wagon shop, harness shop, saddle shops; carpenter shops were all very important in those days at Fort Dalles. The officers and men had to have good quarters and in 1856 when Col. George Wright came to Fort Dalles, it was a bee-hive of activity.' \"The sawmill, located at 9 & Mill creek, was shipped around the Horn. Its installation gave Mill creek its name and provided much of the sawed lumber for Fort Dalles. The post at that time had one of the best military bands in the U.S. and military marches and other band music floated out into the breezes of the wilderness of those days here. The band also provided music for dances and other social activities of the garrison at Fort Dalles. The fort was abandoned in 1871 and remained unoccupied until 1884 when the grounds of the reservation was laid out by the government as Fort Dalles Military Addition to Dalles City, with streets dedicated to the city and lots sold by the government giving U.S. PATENTS, rather than deeds, to the lots. (In 1952 patents, are still being issued for these government lots.) (Louis Fritz, born at Fort Dalles, generally collaborated with Mrs. Crandall and Mrs. Shackelford or other persons writing about Fort Dalles.) (Louis Scholl was born in Germany in 1829 and died in Los Angeles June 6, 1911)\n\nPhotographs titled\n\n\"Old Court House 1854\"\n\n\"Ruins of Fort Dalles\"\n\nGov. Issac Stephen of Washington was outfitted at Fort Dalles before leaving for the peace treaty grounds at Walla Walla in 1855. Maj. Rains provided him with a squad of soldiers under Lt. Gracie. Dr. Hammond was one of the surgeons at Fort Dalles in 1856, and he afterwards became an eminent doctor in San Francisco and sill later was Surgeon General of the U.S. at Washington, D.C. Louis Scholl, Fort Dalles architect, came to The Dalles 7.n the big emigration of 1852. He drew the plans for Ft. Walla Walla, Simcoe and Colville. He was living at Walla Walla in 1904 at age 80. The original plans for Ft. Dalles was presented to Ft. Dalles Historical Society by Mr. Scholl. Fort Dalles was occupied until the Civil War when the soldiers was sent east. For the next 20 years it was looked after by Jacob Fritz, father of Louis Fritz from whose scrapbook much of this information was obtained by courtesy of Louie's daughter Mrs. Thelma Cox of The Dalles. As caretaker, Jacob Fritz was paid by the government until 1884 when it was laid out as an addition to Dalles City. Capt Thomas Jordan selected the best lumber out at the 9 & Mill creek sawmill for the Fort buildings. The sandstone for the foundations and chimneys was quarried on the bluff above Scenic Drive. Much native alder was worked into the stairway rails, manta1s and fancy woodwork. The construction on the fort buildings made it necessary to hire much skilled labor. That labor had to have a place to live so the military authorities was forced to cut down the size of the military reservation and permit some settlement at Fort Dalles Landing down near the wharf (called Wascopam).\n\nThe government had purchased the Methodist Mission buildings from the Methodist society in 1868 for $24,000, notwithstanding the fact that they had bargained with Dr. Marcus Whitman in 1847 to sell to him for $600. This resulted in litigation between the Methodist society and the government until its settlement in 1888. The rails of the mission were stood on and to make a compound fort.\n\nThe buildings of the fort fell into decay and destruction by squatters who carried off the doors, windows, stairs and lumber, burning what remained. No friendly hand ever reached out to save any of the old fort buildings except the surgeon's quarters acquired by Fort Dalles Historical Society, the plaster patched, roof repaired, windows replaced and caretaker hired. Mrs. Wm. Shackelford, Mrs. J.M. Marden, Mrs. Wentworth Lord and Mrs. C.J. Crandall were the 4-Horsewomen of the Historical Apocalypse who conceived the idea of preserving that last building. The first efforts to secure the building was made by the Taine Class of Jay P. Lucas of the U.S. land office and he was appointed to contact the Interior Department regarding securing the building for the Historical Society. Much correspondence ensued. The building was appraised at $1100. The Serosis club in May 1903 looked into the matter and made a trip to Portland to see the officers of the Oregon State Historical Society. Judge Bellinger was president, George Himes was secretary and they were much interested. We contacted Congressman Williamson of The Dalles and he introduced legislation to donate the building to the Oregon State Historical Society in 1904; and they appointed Mrs. William Shackelford, Mrs. C.J. Crandall, Mrs. W. Lord, Mrs. John Marden, Mrs. S.L. Brooks and Dr. Belle Furgeson to look after the property. Out of that committee grew the Fort Dalles Historical Society in 1904. Working under the Oregon Historical Society they elected Mrs. Wm. Shackelford, president, Mrs. Wentworth Lord, Vice-President, Mrs. John Marden 2nd Vice-president, Mrs. C.J. Crandall, secretary and Dr. Belle Furgeson, treasurer. The society spent $1000 on the building and secured Mr. and Mrs. Paddock as custodians.\n\nOn the grounds is an old Indian dug-out canoe 20 feet in length, hollowed out by fire and dressed with sharp stones by Indians before carpenter tools were brought to Oregon. Tablets fastened to trees in the yard are in memory of Joseph G. Wilson, first judge of this district and J.K. Kelley, first mayor of The Dalles and U.S. Senator. The file of the Mountaineer, donated by John Michell, is in the building (now in Portland - 1952). The original plans of the old fort, given by Louis Scholl are in the building, as are the first oil lamp brought to The Dalles; an old table used at the fort in 1850; Indian curios of stone and wood from Mr. Scholl; a china sugar bowl from Father Mesplie's Catholic mission; a section of the \"witness tree\" (14 & Mt. Hood) from which early surveys were made; ancient flint lock fire arms; one of the first melodeons brought to Oregon and photons of many local pioneers. GENERAL ORDER: -- HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC, FORT DALLES, O.T., JUNE 29, 1857 NO WHITE PERSON SHALL BE PERMITTED TO SETTLE IN INDIAN COUNTRY EAST OF THE WHITE SALMON RIVER AND NORTH OF THE COLUMBIA IN WASHINGTON TERRITORY, AND EAST OF THE DESCHUTES IN OREGON.\n\nThis order was revoked by Gen. Harney Oct. 31, 1858. By that time Col. Wright had compelled all Indian tribes to sign treaties of peace and this opened the Inland Empire to settlement, The Dalles being the first original gateway. Emigrants came in long trains to settle in the valleys east of The Dalles (Wascopam) where thousands of horses and cattle grazed on the bunch grass hills that knew no plow for years afterwards. Safe settlement was assured by forts at The Dalles, Walla Walla, Boise, Simcoe, Yakima and Colville.\n\nThe 4th U.S. Infantry brought a number of soldiers to The Dalles who afterwards became pioneer families. Among them being M.M. Cushing and Jacob Fritz, the latter who came via Panama with Col. Bonneville and his quartermaster Lt. U.S. Grant in 1852 and 700 men. The trip took 6 weeks and they lost 100 men by Cholera. In 1878 Pros. Grant told S.L. Brooks at the Cascades, \"I was never stationed at The Dalles, but once was there a few days on an inspection.\" Jacob Fritz was born in Germany 1828) came to Penn. at 16, joined the 4 U.S. Inf. in 1852 coming to Vancouver where he remained till 1856 when he came to Fort Dalles (1863) and was 20 year the caretaker of old Fort Dalles, also employed by the Oregon Steam Nov. Co. as storekeeper and in 1875 was in charge of the commissary of the O.R. & R. Co. shops in The Dalles. He was quartermaster sergeant in the 4 U.S. Inf. He was a very well liked man by children and adults alike, a trait that is handed down in the Fritz family for 4 generations. He married Sarah Collins and they had 10 children among them being Louis, John and Charlie, Mary, Agnes, Ida and Lettie all born at the Fort Dalles garrison home of the family. Jacob Fritz died Feb. 4, 1898. His son Louis, first white child born at Fort Dalles (1867) died Oct. 29, 1848 at 80. He was a member of the National Guard, a painter by trade, a state game warden, a member of The Dalles band and Legion drum & bugle corps. He assisted Mrs. Crandall in writing her Covered Wagon series of pioneer articles on the early history of The Dalles and took a great interest in historical matters and did considerable research work, as the files of the Oregon State Library at Salem shows. Fig married Lora B. Johnson (1892) and they had Thelma (Mrs. Leonard Cox) of The Dalles and Col. Chester Fritz of Salem, manager of the gasoline tax refund department of the State Department\n\nCOL. GEORGE WRIGHT\n\nIn 1881 Col. Geo. Wright was promoted to general and was placed in command of the Pacific department with headquarters at San Francisco where he remained until 1865 when the Oregon department was established with headquarters at Vancouver. He was returning to Fort Vancouver on the Brother Jonathan which struck a reef off Crescent City, Cal., in a storm, sinking within minutes July 9, 1865 with the loss of 200 lives including those of Gen. Wright and his wife whose bodies was found 150 miles south of the wreck. He was born in Vermont and a West Pointer of 1822, a veteran of the Florida and Mexican wars in addition to the Yakima Indian war. They were buried with military honors in the state house square at Sacramento, Cal. Det.21, 1865. The Times-Mountaineer said, \"the lives of Gen. Wright and his wife were beautiful examples of unvarying devotion; and in death they were not divided.\" The Brother Jonathan was considered a good seaworthy boat but in an endeavor to run in to Crescent City, out of the storm, the vessel struck a sunken reef and within minutes went to the bottom with 200 passengers powerless to escape. Gen. Wright had a large sum of gold with him to pay soldiers at Vancouver, which was lost. Wm. Logan, Warm Springs Indian Agent also had a large sum of gold with him to pay Indians and those in the Indian service, which was lost. Many attempts were made to salvage the gold but the sea continues to hold the secret of its location. (Roxa Shackelford).\n\nAt the dedication ceremonies of the Col. Wright school in 1925 Louis Fritz said, \"the old Fort Dalles flag pole and parade grounds are the same as the Col. Wright school grounds, except for the change in size of trees. The saddlery and commissary departments stood just below the school (north), south of which was the hospital. The Guard house stood almost where the school building now is erected. The old flag pots, made on 2 sections, was later out down by emigrants for firewood. The stables for the cavalry equipment and horses were down about where 9th street now is.\" The Col. Wright school was opened Sept. 8, 1925. There were 12 lots in the grounds and the building cost $53,511.36 plus the furnishings of $3778.70.\n\nDALLES CITY 1857\n\nFort Dalles was \"officially\" incorporated as Dalles City June 26, 1857 by Col. N.H. Gates.\n\nThe Umatilla House, the best known hotel in the Pacific northwest, was built by the Nixon Bros. and sold to Mr. Graves. The steamer Hassalo was built at the Cascades for the middle river run to Wascopam (Dalles City) by Bradford do Co. Orlando Humason, Father of Wasco County, built the MOUNTAINEER at DUFUR and launched it at the mouth of the Deschutes river to add to his fleet of sail-boat scows that operated between Deschutesville and Wallula, with R.R. Thompson, of Thompson Addition to The Dalles, as a partner. They used the Old Oregon Trail as a freight and Portage wagon road between The Dalles and Deschutesville via the Old Oregon Trail and Fairbanks and he had Wascopam wagon makers make him some of the largest freight wagons ever seen in the west. They operated this Portage wagon road from 1857 until they were absorbed by the Oregon Steam Nov. Co. in 1862, whom that year (1882) built The Dalles to Celilo Portage railroad. The above wagon road, during those 5 years carried the largest volume of traffic any road of the pioneer west ever carried in the history of the west!\n\nThe Masonic lodge was established in The Dalles March 28 of that year. Five feet of snow was recorded.\n\nWASCOPAM (Dalles City) 1858\n\nR.R. Thompson and Orlando Humason built the upper Columbia river steamer Col. Wright at Deschutesville to take care of the increased volume of passenger and freight traffic to the mines. The Wright paid for itself in a few trips. The Columbia Steam Nav. Co. and the Oregon Steam Nav. Co. operated boats on the middle river from the Cascades to The Dalles. M.M. Cushing built his hotel in Wascopam that year and the Wasco Hotel was built making 3 hotels to take care of the \"floating population\" passing through the city. Bradford a Co. established their boat office in Wascopam. W.G. Biglow started his grocery store, McCormick's hit Hood saloon was in business, McAuliff had a grocery, W.A. Moody had an assay office for weighing and accepting gold dust. P. Craig, who came to the city with military forces, opened the first drug store of the city, W.L. DeMoss opened a bakery. These were the leading merchants of The Dalles City -- WASCOPAM that year and were considered the wealthiest in Oregon\n\nWASCOPAM (Dalles City) 1859\n\nThe Journal, the first newspaper of the city appeared that year, edited by Capt. Thomas Jordan. W.A. Moody built his meeting hall and opera house for public gatherings and entertainment, on First street (south side) between Union and Court. Long lines of freight wagons, pack trains, emigrant schooners lined the streets. Orlando Humason's portage road was dust-choked with traffic day and as late at night as possible, weather permitting. Bradford A Co. warehouse was jammed with freight. Historical writers credit the city with a \"floating tent population of 10,000\", which if true would be the highest the city has ever had. Gold dust was the medium of circulation everything being on a gold basis with no services for less than $1. Mrs. Lord said, \"the town was controlled by gamblers and the tough element and night life was a virtual uncontrolled riot.\"\n\nCol. N.B. Sinnott and Maj. Daniel Handley (a 300 lb. man) acquired the Umatilla House at First and Union and they made it a world famous hotel of 128 rooms. (See special article on). The Dalles fire department was established. The first courthouse of Wasco county was built and the city limits was extended to the 2nd bluff. The Congregationalist church was established. Oregon was admitted to the Union. The lumber for the first courthouse was sawed at the Jonas Mosier mill at Mosier and floated up the river on a scow. The demand for lumber for construction far exceeded the supply so Mr. Mosier, who was The Dalles's first contractor went to Mosier for a good source of lumber and power using barges for transportation, called scows, which had sails for self propulsion.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1860\n\nThe name of the post office of Wascopam was changed to THE DALLES March 22, 1880. The first public school at 4th and Jefferson was erected that year. The wooden Catholic church was erected on Lincoln between 3rd and 4th, facing north, by Father F.A. Vermaas, marking the Catholic religious center being transferred from the County hospital grounds to the area at 3rd and Lincoln streets where it has remained for 92 years.\n\nEdward Crate said he paid $1 for 12 corn seeds that spring which indicated high gold prices that were being charged in The Dalles at that time (almost as bad as in 1952).\n\nIt was along about this period that Chas. White of Los Angeles said he came to The Dalles for the first time with his father Oliver(the White family lived later where the library is); and they stayed at Col. N.H. Gates hotel,(3rd & Union). Playing across the street in the sand he found 3, 50X pieces the first he had ever possessed and went on to explain that 3rd and Union was the \"turning lot\" for the soldiers when they were heading to and from Fort Dalles; and on pay day they would come down in town and get full of liquor and there seemed to be enough Irish in them to always be fighting on that corner lot, going or coming. He added that those Irish soldiers didn't need any reason for starting a fight all they needed was the opportunity, and as they rolled around in the sand they would lose coins out of their pockets which Chas. White and other small boys of the city soon learned to watch and dig around in the \"sand bank\" for. Lots of times the soldiers had regular gang fights or free-for alls in which anywhere from 15 to 50 would be making the blood dust fly and the dust rose like a whirl wind had hit the place. The father Oliver White was a carpenter and help built the old wooden first Wasco County courthouse which sat where the city hall is now located. Capt. R.R. Thompson, Chas. White and Dr. Bonner (who founded Bonner's Ferry, Idaho) ran an early Dalles butcher shop in which he worked 16 hours a day. Still later Mr. White was sheriff of Wasco County. (Chas. White of Los Angeles).\n\nDalles Merchants of 1860\n\nThe census of 1860 showed W.H. Newell, printer; E.W. Waterman, wagonmaker; Lind & Liebe, blacksmiths; F.A. Stern, bootmaker; Francisco Vallard, saddler; Tom & H.C. Gordon, saddle shop; J. H. Murray, sheet metal and iron; Phillip Koster, blacksmith; Fred Bottler, brewery; John Noble, saw mill; U.S. Army, saw mill; Tom Smith, O. Masher, J.M. Thompson, L.T. Henderson and Orlando Humason were saw mill men.\n\nThe Dalles in 1860 by Fred Lockley, Oregon Journal staff.\n\nThe Dalles saw a hectic time in the early 60's as a result of the discovery of the rich placer mines of Canyon City, Auburn and Idaho points. It was the outfitting point for the upper country and the streets were thronged with pack trains outfitting for the mines. The merchandise houses did a big business and the saloons and gambling houses were perfect mints as they ran 24 hours a day. Some years ago I interviewed Col. Henry E. Dosch who was a business man of The Dalles in the early 60's and he said:\n\n\"In the spring of 1864 I was working for Block, Miller & Co. at The Dalles and they had the LARGEST STORE IN OREGON. We not only handled general merchandise and miners supplies but we operated the warehouse from which the goods were taken by pack trains to the mines. The Dalles had a permanent population of about 2500 but the streets were always thronged with transients on their way to and from the mines. There was more activity in The Dalles in one day than in Portland in a month. I had charge of buying of gold dust for the firm. The saloons and merchants of The Dalles accepted gold dust in payment for their wages and we bought the gold dust from them. At that time there was no currency in circulation whatever. There were gold coins from $1 gold pieces to $50 gold slugs, but most of the trading was done by the miners, fresh from the mines, with the dust they themselves washed or rocked out.\n\nThe Dalles in those days was a wide-open town. George Clayton ran the biggest gambling house in eastern Oregon. You could get plenty of action on your gold dust in his place with poker, faro, 3-card monte or you could bet your money on the small horses. The silver quarter was the smallest coin used. Cigars were 50¢ each and drinks ranged from two bits to four bits each. Victor Trevitt ran the Mt. Hood saloon, which was really a sort of a gentlemen's club. He wouldn't allow a drunk in the place nor would he allow gambling. He wouldn't stand for a rough house nor rough talk. As a matter of fact you saw few drunken men in The Dalles in those days. Everyone went \"heeled\" so there was little fighting, for, in case of trouble, the survivor was the one who was the quickest on the trigger. This made people a little cautious about starting anything they couldn't finish.\n\nSo much gold dust was coming into The Dalles that citizens started action for a mint and Congress appropriated $100,000 in 1865 for its construction and the contract was let, the rock being quarried 5 miles up Mill creek. Congress provided no more money and the uncompleted building was sold and converted into a flour mill. The Dalles was the trading center for Idaho, Montana, eastern Washington, all of eastern and southern Oregon. Merchants came from Boise and Walla Walla to purchase supplies.\n\nThe Umatilla House took in more money over their bar than all the rest of the hotels in town put together. The Oregon Steam Navigation Co. had a monopoly on the river and made money hand over fist. They charged $60 a ton for freight from Portland to The Dalles (its now $20 a ton) and the boat fare ran $20 per passenger with meals on the boat at $1 each. Boats were crowded to capacity and had more business than they could handle. Breakfast on the boats was ham and eggs, tenderloin steak, venison, fried potatoes, hot cakes and coffee and that kind of a breakfast sticks to your ribs. Steamboats made from $3000 to $5000 on a single trip! The record May 13, 1862 was $10,000 on a single trip for one boat! Steamboat men were W.S. Ladd, Capt. J.C. Ainsworth, Capt. R.R. Thompson (of The Dalles) Simon G. Reed, B.F. Bradford, Capt. L.W. Coe (of The Dalles) Benj. Stark, Joe Myrick, Richard Williams and George Hoyt. (Lulu D. Crandall clippings, Dalles Library).\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1861\n\nStreets in the city commenced to take their names and Union was named after the northern or Union states of the Civil war, Lincoln after Abraham Lincoln and Liberty for Lincoln's action in setting the slaves free, Washington was named after George Washington, and Court was named on account of the location of the first courthouse east of the Cascades on the site now occupied by the city hall, Federal for the federal government, Laughlin for W.C. Laughlin, Jefferson, Monroe, Madison and Taylor were for presidents, Pentland for Robert Pentland who installed the first water system in the city, Garrison was the street up to the garrison buildings, Wright for Col. George Wright, Jordan for Capt. Thomas Jordan, Mission for the Catholic mission boundary line and Kelley Ave. for Col. J.K. Kelley first mayor of The Dalles, Trevitt for Victor Trevitt, Mt. Hood for the road up toward the mountain. First street was known as Plain and the street below that was Water.\n\nThe winter of 1861 was 24 below and the Columbia river froze over. There was lots of stock lost. Edward Crate Jr. carried the mail to Walla Walla that winter by pack train. The boats generally hauled the mail in better weather to Umatilla and Wallula from Deschutesville.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1862\n\nThe Dalles in 1882 was a \"bee-hive of activity\" following the discovery of gold at Canyon City. The Pony Express service between The Dalles and Canyon City was established (see under Pony Exp.) The pack trains, saddle trains and pony express trains all used the newly established Todd Bridge across the Deschutes below Tygh. It was only a pack horse bridge until it fell into the Deschutes river and was replaced by the wider horse and wagon bridge in 1864; but as a pack horse bridge it handled a vast volume of pack horse traffic to the Canyon City and southern Oregon area. It also was used by pack horse mining trains that came up over the Barlow road from the Willamette valley to the mines. The Homestead act was passed that year allowing some of those miners to take up ranches on the, pack train route to Canyon City. Baker and Umatilla counties were taken off Wasco. The Oregon Steam Navigation Co. was formed that year under the leadership of Capt. J.C. Ainsworth and bought out all other boat operators on the Columbia, and built The Dalles to Celilo railroad at a cost of $50,000 a mile to handle the vast volume of traffic which was clogging the warehouses at both Portland and The Dalles(for complete story see under BOATS). The 1862 to 1888 was the GOLD MINING PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF WASCO COUNTY and CANYON CITY and THE DALLES WERE THE TWO LARGEST CITIES IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. $15,900,000 was taken from Canyon creek by 5000 miners.\n\nThe Times-Mountaineer was established by Wm. M. Hand who operated the paper until his death in 1881. T.S. Lang was editor. The Methodist church was built under the direction of Rev. J.F. DeFoe and the Congregationalist church was built that year under the direction of Rev. Thomas Condon, geologist. The first wooden sidewalks were authorized constructed by the city council and Robert Pentland and James Reynolds laid the first water pipes in the city streets. They sold (187T) to S.L. Brooks and Orlando Humason who in turn sold (1890) to Dalles City, It was claimed in 1890 that The Dalles had sufficient water for a 20,000 town and the best and purest water in the U.S. In 1952 the same volume of water won't hardly care for 5000 people and \"health authorities\" say it is so badly contaminated that \"special chemicals have to be added to it to \"purify it\".\n\nThe winter of 1882 was one of the hardiest on livestock on record.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1863\n\nOn April 20 the first trains operate over The Dalles to Celilo Portage railroad which continued to operate until 1882 when it was taken over and became a part of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Co. (Now the Union Pacific) right of way and track. The Oregon Steam Navigation shops in The Dalles, across Mill creek at First, employed 500 men and had a payroll of $33,000 a month. The Dalles ferry, a sort of a sailboat-barge, propelled by oarsmen on quiet days, was owned and operated by J.B. Dickerson. Governor Zenith Moody of The Dalles founds the town of Umatilla Landing. James K. Kelley was elected first mayor of The Dalles and afterwards became U.S. Senator and he is credited with being the \"Father of The Dalles\".\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1864\n\nThe year 1864 was important in the transportation history of The Dalles. It saw a passable wagon road from Ft. Harney (near Burns) to The Dalles made by Maj. Stems and this permitted the establishment of The Dalles to Canyon City stage-coach service, by Henry H. Wheeler (more complete story under stage coaches) between the two LARGEST CITIES IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. This stage service continued to operate until the completion of the railroad lento Baker about 1884, it being closer to Baker for freight and passengers after that.\n\nRobert Mays and Ezra Hemingway owned the bridge across the Deschutes below Tygh and they had rebuilt it for wagons. This not only made possible wagon and stage service to Canyon City but it also cut 100 MILES OFF, the wear y route of the emigrants between the top of Cottonwood canyon in Sherman county and Tygh Valley on the Barlow road to Oregon City. The emigrants no longer had to come on into The Dalles to find a road back out to Tygh and at a rate of travel of 15 miles a day that meant a WEEK of travel, time saved.\n\nUnion and Grant counties were taken off Wasco making The Dalles less important.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1865\n\nThe Dalles to Salt Lake City mail stage, express and passenger run of 800 miles was established. (more complete story under stage coaches). The sinking of the Brother Jonathan took the lives of Gene George A. Wright and his wife and Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Logan, Indian agent at Warm Springs. The Dalles was credited with a population of 1898 in 1865.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1866\n\nFort Dalles was abandoned by the government in 1866.\n\nThe first earthquake of about 3 seconds duration was felt in The Dalles Nov. 30, 1886 and swayed the lamps, pictures and tinware of the Bunnell & Miller store. A large band of cattle at North Dalles stampeded and ran themselves into exhaustion. Emigrants commenced to head into the Yakima country. George A. Liebe made wagons in The Dalles and did general blacksmith work at 3rd and Laughlin. Lewis Davenport received a new shipment of buggies from Portland which were on display for sale at his livery stable. The government horses broke out of the corrals at Fort Dalles and strayed by the hundreds all over the mountains clear back to the Meadows and their roundup took a week. Over 16,000,000 in gold was received in The Dalles that year. Robert Pentland established his flour mill at 6 & Mill creek. The Dalles Lumber and sawmill was established 16 miles up Mill creek, the lumber being flumed down to the garrison buildings where they established a planing mill and later the flume was used for city water purposes.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1867\n\nThe U.S. Mint construction was started on 3rd between Madison and Monroe and $125,000 was spent on the 75 foot square, one story building before it was abandoned (see special story on). In 1867 Robert Pentland sold his flour mill to The Dalles Woolen Mill Co. who made cloth, blankets and socks. In 1880 it was sold to J.A. Schmidt who converted it back to a 50 barrel flour mill. The machinery for this mill came from the Dufur four mill and the timbers were out of the old government sawmill at 9 & Mill creek.\n\nA county hospital was operated in The Dalles by Dr. Jackson, the first mention of any hospital in histories pertaining to The Dalles. Wm. Thompson and Fred Lusher were treated in the hospital for broken legs by Dr. Jackson. E. Schultz's orchestra played for a dance in the Gymnasium Hall in 1867. He was a deputy sheriff. A.W. Buchanan was Wells Fargo agent.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1868\n\nWhen the mines gave out The Dalles commenced to suffer from its first real depression in 1868. The Dalles to Goldendale, Yakima and Ellensburg stage line was established and continued to operate until the railroad was built into that country in 1884 (for more details see under stages). The telegraph line from Portland to The Dalles and Celilo was strung by the Oregon Steam Nav. Co. The Empire Hotel was started by Tom Smith and French & Co. formed a wholesale liquor and merchandise establishment at 2nd and Washington where they later operated their bank.\n\nThe ads in the Times-Mountaineer of this period were Humason & Odell; Gates & Haft & W. Lair Hill, attorneys; Doctors D.B. Warner, C.B. Brooks, B.11. Mitchell, J.F. Kellogg; druggists Waldron Bros., P. Craig, S. Lemon, Gates & Chapin. First street was the business section while 2nd street was the red light, saloon and chinese district.\n\nTHE FIRST RACE TRACK\n\nThe Indian Race Track, on the beach, about 2 miles east of town (back of the present Tie Plant), was an important place for race events. The Indians liked to race as well as the white man and \"talk up\" their fast ponies, offer to place money on them if any white man cared to call their bets, The Indians most all wore blankets in those days and as soon as the horses started from the line-up they would take their blankets off, wave them and yell and shout, and this waving and yelling all too often caused the white men's horses to bolt or at least shy and slack speed permitting the Indian ponies to win. (Chas. White, Dalles resident of 1856). In later years this Indian race track was used for Sunday and holiday racing events.\n\nPractically all men had horses of one kind or another, if they were residents of the community, so there was a lot of local interest in horse racing. The out-of-town freighters, stage coach, pony express, pack train men and farmers all had horses as well as cowmen and sheepmen. Always some man thought his horse was better than someone else's horse and that's all it took to make a race and the best place to settle it was on the Indian Race track. This track continued to be used for more than 30 years.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1869\n\nThe most important event for that year was the establishment of The Dalles to Prineville stage line for that marked early settlement date for central Oregon which had to obtain its supplies from The Dalles until the building of the Columbia Southern railroad into Shaniko in 1901. The Cow Canyon Toll road was established from Bakeoven to the foot of Cow Canyon by Wm. Clark & Low Doherty to shorten the distance from The Dalles to Prineville (see under stages). A group of Dalles business men formed The Dalles to Boise Military Road Co. via the John Day valley to improve service to that part, of the country (for more story see under Dalles to Boise Military road). The Union Pacific railroad was completed that year into Salt Lake City and Kelton, Utah May 10, 1869 and that stepped up the mail and passenger and express business on The Dalles to Salt Lake City stage line and made it possible to get letters to and from the east in less time than the old route via Panama.\n\nBusiness men of The Dalles in this 1880-69 period (George Owens Directory, Portland & State Lib.) J.W. Adams, J.C. Baldwin, Al Bettengen, J.W. Blakeley, M.M. Cushing, R.W. Crandall, J. Doherty, Ad Edgar, E.P. Fitzgerald, D.M. & J.W. French, R.F. Gibons, Henry Klint, Geo. A. Liebe, Wentworth Lord, J. McNulty, Wm. Mitchell, Geo. Rush, N.B. Sinnott, Max Vogt, H. Whitmore, W.N. Wiley, James Fenton, John Booth, Robert Pentland, Anton Wintemier (made Umatilla House bus), Geo. Liebe, Peter Neal, a sawmill man, McKay & Jackson, sawmill and Geo. Bradford, sawmill. F. Wakerman's ad in the Mountaineer said his boot and shoe store was on Main (lst) opposite Chapin's Hall (1868). The Dalles seemed to have 3 halls then the Moody, Chapins, and Gymnasium where events were held in the 1860 period.\n\nTHE DALLES IN 1870\n\nThe A.M. Williams & CO. STORE\n\nThe second oldest business institution in The Dalles is the A.M. Williams store founded May l, 1870 as a general merchandise store by Edward Wingate and Griffith Williams both of whom came to The Dalles (Chronicle May 1, 1952) as employees of the Oregon Steam Nav. Co. In those days The Dalles was a typical frontier town with board sidewalks, false front stores and mud-filled streets. It was the terminal for freight wagons from as far away as Ellensburg, Baker and Prineville and Lakeview on the south. The store was originally called E. Wingate & Co. with Mr. Wingate the manager while Mr. Williams stayed with the boat company until 1872. Mr. Wingate died in 1883 and Mr. Williams took over the management until his death in 1888 when it was jointly managed by Mrs. Wingate and Mrs. Williams. Mrs. Williams was Anna Marshall so she retained the initials A.M. in front of her married name. She was the mother of 10 children. In 1891 her son Edward took over the management of the store and in 1893 it was changed to a dry goods store. It has always occupied its present location expanding to its present frontage in 1896, and has always been known as the A.M. Williams store since 1888.\n\nIn 1898 Edward Williams and W.E. Walther formed a partnership in the hardware and implement business gradually changing to the Walther-Williams automobile agency. Edward Williams died in 1928 and his brother Carlton P. Williams managed the store until 1938 when J.F. Moore became manager, Mr. Williams moved to the presidency of the firm which he still holds and resides in The Dalles. The store was remodeled in 1939 with new front and display windows, a full basement and improved main floor with 30 departments. Richard Rodman became manager July 31, 1951. The company has 3 stores, one in Corvallis and one in Eugene besides The Dalles which is the home office and employs 85 persons, 35 of whom are in The Dalles. The store has remained in the Williams family for 3 generations.\n\nThe Dalles in 1870 had a population of 3356.\n\n1871-72\n\nThe big $100,000 fire on Aug. 17 started in the Wenz furniture shop and would have taken the town had not the wind changed. It was stopped by the popular trees at Dr. Thomas Condon's home on 3rd between Laughlin and Jefferson. The Union street park school was established that year. In 1878 the First Baptist church was founded by Rev. O.D. Taylor. The Modoc Indian war started Nov. 29 of that year in south-eastern Oregon and it was a hard winter campaign to force them to submit. The 1870's was a period of depression in the history of the city and not very much activity occurred. Lake county was taken off Wasco, in 1874 showing settlement in that part of the state and wheat was being raised generally in the central part of the county but lack of cheap transportation prevented too much expansion.\n\nCATTLE DRIVES\n\nThe 1870 period did see eastern cattle buyers at the Umatilla House to arrange for purchase of cattle to be formed in large bands or herds to be driven to the railroad terminal at Kelton, Utah, for shipment on the Union Pacific railroad to eastern markets. These big sheep, cattle and horse drives are all but forgotten pages in the important history of The Dalles and Wasco county, but they were important annual events of those days in the 1870's to 1884 when the railroad was extended west to Wallula. Either a number of cattle or stock raisers would join together on those 800 mile drives or else the regular buyers bought \"on foot, as is\" and formed their own bands and hired their own professional drivers who made it a business to drive stock through to Kelton or Salt Lake City. The sheep and horse drives were made in the same way, except that the horse drives were generally from The Dalles area to Army Posts, forts or camps in other localities. Daniel Cooper of Fairbanks had 2 sons who devoted the best years of their lives in the 1870's driving horses to Montana and Wyoming and the Dakotas for delivery to army forts for Indian fighting purposes or freight hauling teems. The flood of 1876 stood at 57.3 June 23. In 1877 the Umatilla House burned but was rebuilt. The half million dollar fire Of 1878 started in Corum's saddle shop (211 E 2nd). H.J. Waldon died from over-exertion during this fire. This was an Oct. 27 fire.\n\nThe Dalles to Wapinitia stage, mail and express line was established in 1878 (see under stages). In 1879 the Pioneer Hotel fire proved to be another ½ million dollar fire before it was stopped after 3 hours burning May 21, 1879. The snow was reported to be 29 inches that winter and the flood the next spring stood at 48.7.\n\nTHE DALLES IN THE 1880's\n\nAfter the big fires cleaned out the old, wooden, shacks Max Vogt built the Vogt and Chapman business blocks on 2nd street out of fireproof brick made at The Dalles brick yard kilns which were located on the \"brickyard road\", adjoining the I.O.O.F. cemetery (1880) and also built his 3 story Vogt Opera house, the pride and joy of his heart, which allowed the best in the entertainment world of those days to be brought to and shown at The Dalles and it was at these operas in the Vogt Opera house that Wm. Birgfeld's orchestra would amaze the show performers and managers by being able to play their light opera music with his orchestra; often without a single rehearsal There was not another orchestra north of San ' , Francisco or west of Chicago who could do that in those days!\n\nThen Wasco Independent Academy was established in 1881 as a private school to which many of the pioneers of that period attended. It was created a state normal school in 1889. Prof. Tom Gatch was principal, Mrs. S.A. Stowell, preceptress, Mary Smith, primary department with about 60 students in the first attendance. By 1893 it was found support did not meet expanses so it was sold to school district 12 and became a part of The Dalles public school system.\n\nThe RAILROAD EXPANSION PERIOD 1882-84\n\nThe railroad construction period in The Dalles history brought a \"big boom\" to the little city which was equal to the gold rush days of 1880, but it only lasted about 2 years and the railroad took far more away from The Dalles than it ever brought to it. We lost all of our eastern Oregon and Washington trade and our importance as a trading center and shipping center. Central Oregon, the mid-Columbia area and the eastern portion of Klickitat county were the only crumbs left. We lost Central Oregon in 1901 with the construction of the Columbia Southern railroad into Shaniko. The railroad did continue their shops in The Dalles and the directory of 1883 contains the names of practically all of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Co. employees, some 500 in number and their shops including offices, tin shop, round-house, blacksmith, drafting, foundry, pump works, tanks, store rooms were credited with covering 18 acres, west across Mill creek or First from the Umatilla House. These shops were moved to Portland in 1883 another blow from which The Dalles never recovered from as 1500 people left town with them.\n\nThe History of Central Oregon said, \"The Dalles in 1880 gained notoriety as being a 'tough town' the undesirable element flocked to the city the result being robberies, homicides and for a period almost a reign of terror. The growth of the city has exceeded expectations equal to the mining excitement when box houses would be built like magic.\"\n\nIn 1882 Lang & Ryan drove 13,000 head of cattle to Salt Lake City for shipment east on the Union Pacific railroad which had not yet been constructed west, until September 11, 1883.\n\nThe new Wasco County Courthouse at 3rd and Union was constructed at a cost of $23,000.\n\nThe Wasco Warehouse was incorporated (1883) by J.W. French, S.L. Brooks, E.B. McFarland and managed by Wentworth Lord. They handled millions of pounds of wool, hides, pelts, sold hay, grain and supplies for farmers and construction work. (See story under ELECTRICITY).\n\nThe Columbia river fish wheels at The Dalles, developed by Frank Seufert, was credited with taking 20 car loads of fish per day (1884) and this marked the development of a new industry in The Dalles. (For more fish story see under SEUFERT).\n\nGilliam county was taken off Wasco in 1885 and Morrow county taken off in 1886 which dates mark the settlement of those parts of old Wasco county. In 1887 Malheur and Wallows counties were lost. In 1883 the Times-Mountaineer said that sawmills and a flour mill, printing machinery and planing mills were taking power from Mill creek waters and that there was lots of water going to waste, that could furnish power for other manufacturers. The Dalles at that time had 2 breweries, several carriage shops, an iron and brass foundry and that the railroad employed 500 map and had $1,000,000 invested in Dalles property.\n\nI.C. NICKELSEN BOOK STORE\n\nWe mention the I.C. Nickelsen Book store in 1883 for it was the predecessor to Weigelt Book store and is one of the oldest business institutions in The Dalles. In 1883 he carried a large stock of toys, notions, music, school books, pianos, organs and other musical instruments and has been located at 315 E 2nd for more than 50 years. Mr. Nickelsen was born in Germany (1842) son of Peter and Christina (Petersen) Nickelsen. He received his early education in Germany and came to New York in 1859 where for 8 years he was in the restaurant business. Then he went to San Francisco by boat and on to Portland where the ship was nearly wrecked on the Columbia bar at Astoria. He came on up to The Dalles (1867) where he worked 2½ years in the Umatilla House before starting his own notion and book store. He was burned out in the big fire of 1891 but rebuilt and continued in business. In 1872 he married Josine Fredden of Germany and they had daughters Christina (Mrs. Harry Grubb), Julia and Clara. Mrs. Nickelsen died in 1883. Gus and Paul Weigelt bought the store in 1927.\n\nZ.F. MOODY STORE\n\nAnother of the larger stores here in 1883 was that of Gov. Zenas F. Moody, located at l & Washington where the Model Laundry is now. Mr. Moody was called \"the merchant prince of The Dalles\", at that time and he carried one of the largest stocks of merchandise in the city consisting of dry goods, groceries, hardware, clothing, boots and shoes. He had a water operated elevator in his store, one of the first in The Dalles. (For more Moody story see under MO"
