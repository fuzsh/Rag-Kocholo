He was a member of Stephen B. Austin's first settlement in what was then Mexico and later Texas. Both the city and county of Denton ain Texas are named after John Bernard Denton. From Stephen F. Austin's Register of Families, edited by Villa Mae Williams from the original in the General Land Office, Austin, TX. The introduction is by Empresario Esteven F. Austin under law of colonization of State of Coahuila and Texas, March 24, 1825: John Denton is listed as single and is give the 1/4 league between Miller and Laky to lay between the wood and the river; one quarter adjoining John Brown on Carancahua Creek. Denton CO, TX is a 900 square-mile county situated in the Grand Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers region of north central Texas. Although earlier a part of Nacogdoches CO, in its first session the Texas Congress included the area in Fannin CO where it remained until 1846 when Denton CO was created. Both the county and county seat are named after John B. Denton who was killed in 1841 near the south county line in a battle with the Keechi Indians. A lengthy first-hand account of the Indian battle in which John Bernard Denton was killed is a part of the Library of Sue Montgomery-Cook."
