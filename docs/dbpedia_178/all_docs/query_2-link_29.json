Denton Gravesite - Denton County Courthouse Square Historic District - Denton, TX\n\nPosted by: QuarrellaDeVil\n\nN 33° 12.889 W 097° 07.972\n\n14S E 674008 N 3676654\n\nThe gravesite of Colonel John B. Denton is considered as \"contributing\" to the Denton County Courthouse Square Historic District, and is located on the grounds of the old Denton County Courthouse, 110 W Hickory St, Denton, TX.\n\nWaymark Code: WMQVAC\n\nLocation: Texas, United States\n\nPublished By: QuesterMark\n\nViews: 11\n\nJohn Bunyan Denton didn't live to see the county or the city that bear his name. A 1936 Texas Centennial Marker is at his gravesite on the courthouse grounds, and it provides a little background:\n\nBorn in Tennessee\n\nJuly 26, 1806, came to Texas in January, 1836\n\nAs a Methodist circuit rider\n\nKilled in the Village Creek Indian Fight\n\nMay 24, 1841\n\nIn what is now Tarrant County\n\nNamed for Gen. Edward H. Tarrant\n\nWho commanded the volunteers\n\nDenton City and County were named for the\n\nPioneer lawyer, preacher, soldier\n\nOf that name\n\nDenton was killed in what is now Arlington, TX. He was originally buried near the mouth of Oliver Creek, near its confluence with Denton Creek (in today's Denton County), but was disinterred some years later by John S. Chisum and reburied on Chisum's ranch near Bolivar, TX. In 1901, Denton was disturbed one final time, as his remains were brought to the courthouse square and placed to rest.\n\nThe 1977 Texas Historical Marker behind Denton's headstone provides some information about the City of Denton:\n\nPioneers settled this locality in the 1840s. In 1846 the Texas Legislature created Denton County - one of several carved from the Peters Colony grant. After trying other sites, the voters in 1856 accepted for county seat this tract donated by Hiram Cisco, William Loving, and William Woodruff. The city and county were named for John B. Denton (1806-41), a minister killed while defending frontier settlers.\n\nWoodruff, fellow surveyor C.C. Lacy, and attorney Otis Welch platted the townsite. In 1857 city lots were auctioned, the post office opened, and a church was founded. J.M. Blount, Joseph A. Carroll, W.F. Egan, and I.D. Ferguson were pioneer leaders. A cotton gin and plants for making bricks, corn meal, flour and ice soon developed. The \"Monitor,\" a newspaper, began its career in 1868. Sam Bass (1851-78), legendary western outlaw, trained and raced \"The Denton Mare\" while living and working as a local farm hand.\n\nNorth Texas State University originated here as Texas Normal College in 1890, and Texas Woman's University opened in 1903 as the College of Industrial Arts. Agriculture-related businesses, education, and small factories sustain the economy. The city grew from 1,194 in its first census (1880) to 39,874 by 1970.\n\n--\n\nA hotel, operated by the aforementioned C.C. Lacy, once stood at the northwest corner of Oak and Locust Streets, and Sam Bass had a job there as a stable boy before becoming an outlaw. A modern building stands there today, visible from Denton's gravesite.\n\nName of Historic District (as listed on the NRHP): Denton County Courthouse Square Historic DistrictLink to nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com page with the Historic District: [Web Link]NRHP Historic District Waymark (Optional): [Web Link]Address:\n\n110 W Hickory St, Denton, TX 76201How did you determine the building to be a contributing structure?: Narrative found on the internet (Link provided below)Optional link to narrative or database: [Web Link]\n\nSearch for...\n\nGeocaching.com Google Map\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nMapQuest\n\nBing Maps\n\nNearest Waymarks\n\nNearest NRHP Historic Districts - Contributing Buildings\n\nNearest Geocaches\n\nCreate a scavenger hunt using this waymark as the center point"
