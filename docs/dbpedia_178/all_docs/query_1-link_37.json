        "text": "Denton Family- by Marybeth Taylor Vessell\n\nDescendants of Samuel Denton, Sr.\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1. SAMUEL1 DENTON, SR. was born 1734 in Orange Co, NY, and died 1811 in Pendleton District, SC. He married MARGARET MOORE 1752, daughter of SAMUEL MOORE. She died in Granville Co, NC.\n\nNotes for SAMUEL DENTON, SR.:\n\nSamuel was a Revolutionary War Solider in the NC Continental Line and received bounty land in White Co, TN, as did his brothers James and Joseph.\n\nHe is in the Patriot Index, Part 1, page 820. He was a Private in the NC line.\n\nBy 1769 both Abraham III and samuel had joined a wagon train from the Shenandoah Vallet to Lord Granville's land sale in North Carolina. This wagon train was made up of the then curent younger generation of the Pllumleys, Weavers, Moores, Hoggs, Dentons, etc. This, the growing up children of the original immigrants to the Virginia frontier were marrying and developing familes of their own. They could not afford the local land and family holdings were not large enough to divide among all of the children. When Lord Granville began to advertise his land for sale, it was a new frontier to these young families. Tax lists and early censuses show that Samuel settled in what is now Granville Co, while Abraham III settled in Caswell Co. Each chose to settle near where their wives' relatives bought land--the Moores around Samuel and the Hoggs around Abraham III's family.\n\nMore About SAMUEL DENTON and MARGARET MOORE:\n\nMarriage: 1752\n\nChildren of SAMUEL DENTON and MARGARET MOORE are:\n\n2. i.

He was born July 06, 1780 in Washington CO, TN, and died 1845 in Fannin CO, GA.\n\nNotes for BENJAMIN CHASTAIN:\n\n[chastain.ged]\n\nBenjamin was born on the land his father patented in 1782. He moved with his father's family to South Carolina where they are found in Pendleton District SC in the 1790 Census. Benjamin moved his family to Habersham CO, GA. In 1821 he was sworn in as one of the Justices of the Peace of Habersham CO. The town of Clarkesville was officially incorporated and made the county seat on Nov. 26, 1823. Benjamin Chastain and Benjamin Cleveland conveyed 32 acres (land lots number 2 and 19) to the Justices of the Inferior Court and the town was laid out and sold lots to its first inhabitants.\n\nIn 1826, Benjamin represented Habersham CO in the Georgia House of Representatives, beginning a long period of public service by himself and his five sons. He served in the House from 1826 through 1834 and as Justice of the Inferior Court 1821-1825, 1829 and 1833-35. By 1834 he had moved his family to Gilmer CO, GA and settled on the Toccoa River.\n\nDuring the year of 1826, he served as an agent of Indian Affairs. The following letter attests to that fact: \"Elijay Decr. 19th Sirs: Yours of the 4th instant is now before me and the contents noticed in answer I would say that Benjamin Chastain did exercise the duties of agent during the year 1836. But his being situated in a remote part of the County I know but lettle of his actings. For the last year there has been no agent in this county. On inquiring for some person who would be willing to serve as agent and who at the same time would be relied on for the faithful discharge of said office I am urged upon by my friends to recommend to your notice Benjamin M. Griffith who is my son and feeling a delicacy in doing so, in consequence of the relation I refer you to the next page.\" (The reply:) \"B. Griffith Georgia, Gilmer County. We take a pleasure in recommending to his Excellency George R. Gilmer, Benjamin M. Griffith as a fit and suitable person the States agent of this County Decr. 19th 1837.\"\n\nBenjamin Chastain is buried at the Antioch Baptist Cemetery in Fannin CO. Rebecca is buried next to him. Benjamin and Rebecca Denton Chastain must have raised their children to be aware of and active in their community, religious and political affairs. One son was a preacher, two of their daughters married preachers, a third married the son of a preacher, and all six sons were active in some extent in the political arenas of their particular counties.\n\nMore About BENJAMIN CHASTAIN and REBECCA DENTON:\n\nMarriage: January 30, 1798, Pendleton District, SC\n\nChildren of REBECCA DENTON and BENJAMIN CHASTAIN are:\n\ni.
