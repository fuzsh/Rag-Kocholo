I definitely\n\nwould go again.”\n\n— an American Vietnam Veteran\n\nrom the Delta to the DMZ, young Americans\n\nanswered the call to duty and proudly served —\n\nmany with “Old Slabsides,” better known as the\n\n“.45.” In military nomenclature, Uncle Sam called it the\n\n“M1911A1 Service Pistol.” It was the most powerful\n\nmilitary sidearm ever issued in the world. And with it\n\nin Vietnam, we drove more nails in the coffin of\n\nCommunism, which would lead to its eventual fall.\n\nBut Vietnam would be the .45's last war. Soon\n\nafterwards, it was retired and replaced by the lesspowerful 9mm so we could comply with NATO ammo\n\nlogistics. So now, the .45, the “.45 era” and our Veterans\n\nwho fought with it are passing into military history.\n\nHow much longer will the .45 be made? No one\n\nknows. But while it still is, The American Historical\n\nFoundation is proud to salute those who served in the\n\nArmed Forces between 1959 and 1975, and the patriotic\n\nAmericans who supported them, by appropriately,\n\nissuing this firing museum-quality Limited Edition .45.\n\nF\n\n24-Karat Gold Plating\n\nWhen you pick up this three-pound slab of steel and\n\ngold, you will know you are holding a special, firing\n\nLimited Edition, custom gunsmithed to museum quality.\n\nLike the polished black granite of the Vietnam\n\nMemorial, you can see your reflection in its mirrorpolished steel, blued to gloss black and richly plated\n\nwith genuine 24-Karat Gold.\n\nHistorical Symbolism\n\nDeep bas relief etchings, selectively plated with\n\n24-Karat Gold, form the central panoply, with borders of\n\nstrapped bamboo and dragons, the Asian symbol of\n\npower and protection, all designed by Vietnam Veteran,\n\nthe late B.J. Weber. Historical inscriptions include the\n\ndates of the war and General Westmoreland’s praise of all\n\nwho served — ”No one could have done it better” with\n\nthe Vietnam Service Medal surmounted on napalm\n\nflames. In keeping with the high-quality custom gunsmithing, all the 24-Karat Gold plating—including across\n\nthe trigger, hammer, slide stop, magazine catch, magazine\n\ncatch lock, safety lock and grip screws—is to Jewelers\n\nGrade-Heavy thickness, for lasting beauty and value.\n\nThe grips are specially hand-finished to look like\n\nbamboo, but are actually custom-crafted American\n\nOak. Inset in each grip is a full-color, fired enamel\n\nTo safely protect your Vietnam War .45 from dust and\n\nunauthorized handling, a solid American Walnut\n\nDisplay Case is available, with locking glass lid and\n\nJungle Green velvet-lined interior. Wall mounts or\n\ndisplays on shelf or desk or mantel. 14\"x8\"x4\".\n\ncloisonné, incorporating the flag of the Republic\n\nof Vietnam (which colors appear, vertically, in the\n\nVietnam Service Medal).\n\nFires .45 ACP\n\nEach is custom-built to military specifications by\n\nAuto-Ordnance/Thompson, founded by General John T.\n\nThompson, who helped develop the .45 ACP round\n\nand the Thompson Sub-Machine Gun. Made to\n\nuncompromising standards, the NRA test firing showed\n\naccuracy “Significantly better than the average asissued M1911.” All parts are interchangeable with military-issued pistols. And it fires .45 ACP ammo, so it\n\ncould be used to defend your home, family or nation.\n\nThe Vietnam War Commemorative .45 is strictly\n\nlimited to only 2,500 pistols, worldwide. Each pistol is\n\nengraved with its special Registry Number between\n\nVN0001 and VN2500. A Certificate of Authenticity\n\nattesting to the special Registry Number, edition limit and\n\nthe purity of the 24-Karat Gold plating accompanies your\n\nLimited Edition M1911A1 .45.\n\nSatisfaction Guaranteed\n\nThis museum-quality .45 is available exclusively\n\nfrom The American Historical Foundation.

Conley\n\nChase Studios\n\nAs veterans,\n\nit is our\n\nduty to\n\nhelp set\n\nthe record\n\nstraight.\n\no chapter in U.S. history is so\n\nhaunting, complicated or misunderstood. From early operations\n\nadvising civilian irregulars, to rooftop\n\nextractions of ﬂeeing refugees, to elaborate\n\npost-mortems by all manner of experts,\n\nthe Vietnam War fueled unparalleled\n\nmetamorphosis in America.\n\nRegarded as our longest military conﬂict,\n\nVietnam put America’s most volatile years\n\nsince the Civil War on a world stage. It lit a\n\nfuse that sizzled across college campuses,\n\nthrough big cities and small towns, into\n\nour radios, newspapers and TVs. It touched\n\noff revolutions in civil rights, gender\n\nequality, popular culture, religion, government, education and the environment. The\n\nwar deﬁned the times, then and now.\n\nVietnam uprooted American teen-agers\n\nraised on post-World War II prosperity and\n\ndropped them into a dangerous jungle of\n\nrain, sweat, snakes, bullets and blood – to\n\nbattle an enemy force willing to feed more\n\nthan a million lives into the meat grinder\n\nof its war plan. The enemy, rarely discernible, did not measure progress by body\n\ncounts or battles won. Success was to\n\nendure: if necessary, forever.\n\nThe public had difﬁculty understanding\n\nVietnam, a war so unlike any other we\n\nhad fought. The media converted that\n\nmisunderstanding into a Vietnam mythology that, with rare exceptions, sensationalized isolated incidents and grossly\n\nmisrepresented the men and women who\n\nfought there. Most disturbing of all, those\n\nmisrepresentations became the basis for\n\nmuch written history on the subject. TimeLife Books in “The Vietnam Experience,”\n\nfor example, described those who proudly\n\nserved their country as “outcasts …\n\nsoldiers ﬁghting a war nobody wanted.”\n\nThe mythology painted an image of the\n\nVietnam War as a hallucinogenic kaleidoscope of unrest, drug abuse, draft-card\n\nburning and government mistrust. True,\n\nthese elements were part of it. But how\n\nlittle we see of our reason for being there –\n\nto protect a free society from invasion and\n\nconquest. Acts of heroism on the battleﬁeld were routinely overshadowed by acts\n\nof civil disobedience at home. It is little\n\nwonder that, despite thousands of volumes\n\non the subject, history has failed to tell the\n\nVietnam War story well. Too often, it has\n\nbeen explained by those who were not\n\nthere – or worse, by those who were there\n\nbut chose to accelerate the mythology\n\n4\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\nrather than tell the truth. Exaggeration, as\n\nHollywood soon discovered, pays better.\n\nAdmittedly, it is a difﬁcult story to tell,\n\none that bears consideration from many\n\nangles. This issue of The American Legion\n\nMagazine offers a new contribution to an\n\nevolving understanding of the war, how it\n\nshaped modern America and the world. It\n\nis presented in honor of those who fought\n\nthere – people who came home and started\n\ntheir lives over, those who didn’t come\n\nhome and those who came home changed\n\nin ways we don’t fully comprehend. This\n\nissue is for them, my fellow veterans of the\n\nVietnam War era.\n\nLegion’s Support of Freedom. The war,\n\nthe public’s understanding of it and the\n\naftermath have been integral to The\n\nAmerican Legion agenda since the 1950s.\n\nBefore U.S. troops other than specialoperations personnel were committed to\n\nthe region, the Legion supported aid to\n\nSouth Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in\n\ntheir quests for self-government.\n\nWhen U.S. destroyers were attacked in\n\nthe Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 and U.S.\n\nmilitary action was authorized, National\n\nCommander Don Johnson said there was\n\n“but one answer for Americans … and\n\nthat is victory, a victory which will stem\n\nthe tide of red aggression not only in\n\nVietnam but in all of Southeast Asia … For\n\nthis nation, we must ﬁ rst stem the communist invasion and then talk of peace.”\n\nThe Legion urged swift, decisive military action. Nearly every year of the war,\n\nAmerican Legion national commanders\n\ntraveled to Vietnam and came back with\n\nthe same conclusions: interdiction of the\n\nHo Chi Minh Trail, breakup of enemy\n\nstrongholds in Laos and Cambodia,\n\naggressive strikes against supply posts and\n\nroutes in North Vietnam, and closing the\n\nport at Haiphong would go a long way\n\ntoward ending the war. But as it progressed, Vietnam became more politically\n\ncomplicated and publicly divisive, and in\n\n1970, the Legion supported the decision to\n\nbegin withdrawing U.S. troops.\n\nThe Legion’s stated belief on Vietnam\n\nwas that we were there for all the right\n\nreasons, reasons not unlike those which\n\nsummoned U.S. GIs to save the world from\n\ntyranny less than 25 years earlier. The\n\nsame ideals were employed to protect\n\nSouth Korea from communist aggression\n\nin the early 1950s.

We went to Vietnam to\n\ndefend human freedom and to\n\noppose aggressive conquest. Since\n\nthe end of World War I, the\n\nLegion has steadfastly agreed that\n\nthese are values worth ﬁghting\n\nfor, “to make right the master of\n\nmight.” The men and women who\n\nwent to defend those values, often\n\nto the death, did so with the same\n\nspirit of duty, honor and country\n\nthat guided our troops in the ﬁ rst\n\nworld war, the second world war,\n\nthe Korean War and in all U.S.\n\narmed conﬂ icts that followed.\n\nThroughout the Vietnam War,\n\nas turmoil and dissent captivated\n\npublic attention – much to the\n\nenemy’s pleasure – The American\n\nLegion stood by its principles.\n\nAntiwar demonstrators were\n\nburning American ﬂags and\n\ndisparaging our troops; the Legion\n\nwas passing out U.S. Flag pins and\n\nputting up billboards proclaiming\n\n“To Our Guys in Vietnam, Give\n\n’Em Hell! We’re With You 100%.”\n\nThe Legion’s “Operation Show\n\nYour Colors” program was a\n\nnationwide rallying cry to support\n\nour troops and returning veterans\n\nalike. The Legion organized\n\nparades to show that support,\n\nincluding one in Nassau County,\n\nN.Y., that drew 25,000 marchers.\n\nBut the protest movement\n\npersisted, standing in the way of\n\nthe war’s swift prosecution,\n\nwhich the Legion so strongly\n\nurged. Legionnaires knew from\n\nexperience that anything less\n\nthan support at home is a disservice to the men and women of the\n\narmed forces. Anything less can,\n\nand did, cost lives.\n\nAnd so The American Legion\n\nworked dutifully at the local and\n\nnational levels to support U.S.\n\ntroops ﬁghting there – from\n\nfashioning care packages to be\n\nsent overseas to lobbying for\n\nsubstantially better education\n\nbeneﬁts in expanded versions of\n\nthe GI Bill. The Legion poured its\n\npassion into a “Jobs for Veterans”\n\nprogram and hosted career fairs\n\nand served as a liaison between\n\nemployers, schools, community\n\n6\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\nleaders and returning veterans.\n\nThousands found work this way.\n\nThe Legion was an early, ﬁ rm\n\nvoice demanding a full accounting of U.S. POWs and MIAs.\n\nLegion posts became information\n\nclearing houses for returning\n\nveterans who needed to know\n\nabout VA beneﬁts. The Legion\n\nfought for a succession of increases in compensation for those who\n\ncame home with service-connected disabilities. How those disabilities were to be deﬁ ned was, and\n\nstill is, a serious issue for Vietnam\n\nveterans and the Legion alike.\n\nAfter the War. By the 1970s, staff\n\nin the Legion’s Veterans Affairs &\n\nRehabilitation division had\n\nbecome increasingly suspicious of\n\na link between the chemical\n\ndefoliant Agent Orange and dozens\n\nof health problems reported by\n\nveterans who came into contact\n\nwith it during the war. Problems\n\nranged from skin rashes to cancer\n\nto birth defects among the children of those who handled the\n\nherbicide, which was later banned.\n\nIn 1979, the VA reported receiving\n\n500 applications for compensation\n\nfrom sick veterans exposed to it. A\n\nyear later, that number grew to\n\n4,800. By 1982, it was 67,000.\n\nBy that time, the Legion had\n\nalready mobilized its members to\n\nidentify any and all veterans who\n\nhad contact with Agent Orange.\n\nThe VA promised thorough\n\nmedical examinations, but almost\n\nno research had been amassed on\n\nthe subject, and all claims for\n\nbeneﬁts based on exposure to\n\nAgent Orange had thus far been\n\nrejected. The Legion wanted\n\nresults sooner than the VA or the\n\nCenters for Disease Control would\n\nproduce. “The American Legion is\n\nnot going to put this issue in the\n\ncloset until 1987,” National\n\nCommander Al Keller said after\n\nthe CDC announced it would take\n\nﬁve years for conclusions from its\n\nnational study. “We will urge the\n\ntimely release of all relevant\n\nﬁ ndings as they become available.”\n\nTimely releases did not happen.\n\nDissatisﬁed with the CDC’s\n\nresponse, the Legion joined forces\n\nwith two epidemiologists – Drs.\n\nJeanne Stellman and Steven\n\nStellman – to produce an independent study of 15,000 Vietnam War\n\nveterans from six different states.\n\nMore than 700 Legionnaires were\n\ntrained to assist in “The American\n\nLegion and Columbia University\n\nStudy of Vietnam-Era Veterans,”\n\nwhich was produced within the\n\nyear and still stands as the\n\nfundamental Agent Orange study\n\nthat brought about VA recognition\n\nand beneﬁts. That process continues today, as more conditions,\n\nsuch as type 2 diabetes and\n\nnumerous cancers, are now\n\nrecognized by VA as Agent\n\nOrange-linked.\n\nThe Legion similarly pioneered\n\nclinical acceptance of posttraumatic stress disorder among\n\nVietnam veterans in the 1980s.\n\nThe modern cousin to a malady\n\nLegion founders described as\n\n“shell shock” that afﬂicted U.S.\n\ncombat veterans after World War I,\n\nPTSD was taken seriously as a VAcompensable disability only after\n\nsteady pressure from the Legion.\n\nAnd it was the Legion that successfully lobbied to keep VA from\n\nclosing down facilities that treated\n\nPTSD-suffering veterans.\n\nSo many strides regarding\n\nVietnam and its veterans have\n\nbeen arduous. Even the blackgranite Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington was an uphill\n\nbattle the Legion fought. Our\n\nmembers raised more than $1.2\n\nmillion, making the Legion the\n\nWall’s single biggest contributor.\n\nSince then, the memorial has\n\nbecome a national treasure. As\n\nCommander Keller said when\n\nground was broken, “There is no\n\nshame in serving with honor and\n\ncourage in difﬁcult times. And\n\nthere is no shame enshrining the\n\nnames of fallen comrades in\n\nimmutable stone for generations\n\nto recall.”\n\nBehind those enshrined names\n\nis a story. It is a story of fortitude\n\nand sacriﬁce, courage and camaraderie, of war and in its aftermath. It is not a myth, not the\n\nVietnam portrayed by Hollywood,\n\nbut the truth. It is our duty as\n\nveterans to deliver that truth in\n\nour own words, in the names of\n\nthose with whom we served.\n\nVETERANS, CURRENT, AND\n\nRETIRED MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\nGET A $500 ADDITIONAL\n\nCASH ALLOWANCE\n\nON THE PURCHASE OR LEASE OF A JEEP VEHICLE.\n\n2004 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE\n\n2003 JEEP LIBERTY\n\n2003 JEEP WRANGLER\n\nNow all veterans, current, and retired U.S. military personnel can receive a $500 cash allowance—in addition to\n\ncurrent incentives—good toward any Jeep Liberty, Grand Cherokee, or Wrangler.* It’s a small gesture of gratitude\n\nfor the men and women who have served and continue to serve in our nation’s armed forces.\n\nPOWERTRAIN LIMITED WARRANTY†\n\nSEE YOUR JEEP DEALER.\n\nJeep is a registered trademark of DaimlerChrysler Corporation. *Must present current military ID, retirement or discharge papers at time of purchase.\n\nSee your dealer for details. †7-year or 70,000-mile Powertrain Limited Warranty on all Jeep vehicles.

The ﬁrst involved the\n\naftermath of the carnage and destruction of World War\n\nII, which left scars on every country in the region and\n\ndramatically changed Japan’s role in East Asian affairs.\n\nThe second was the sudden, regionwide end of\n\nEuropean colonialism, which created governmental\n\nvacuums in every second-tier country except Thailand\n\nand, to a lesser extent, the Philippines. The third was\n\nthe emergence of communism as a powerful tool of\n\nexpansionism by military force, its doctrine and\n\nstrategies emanating principally from the birthplace of\n\nthe Communist International: the Soviet Union.\n\nF\n\nEurope’s withdrawal from the\n\nregion dramatically played into\n\nthe hands of communist revolutionary movements, especially in\n\nthe wake of the communist\n\ntakeover of China in 1949. Unlike\n\nin Europe, these countries had\n\nnever known Western-style\n\ndemocracy. In 1950, the partitioned country of Korea exploded\n\ninto war when the communist\n\nNorth invaded South Korea, with\n\nthe Chinese Army joining the\n\neffort six months later. Communist insurgencies erupted\n\nthroughout Indochina. In Malaysia, the British led a 10-year antiguerrilla campaign against Chinabacked revolutionaries. A similar\n\ninsurgency in Indonesia brought\n\nabout a communist coup attempt,\n\nalso sponsored by the Chinese,\n\nwhich was put down in 1965.\n\nThe situation inside Vietnam\n\nwas the most complicated. First,\n\nfor a variety of reasons the\n\nFrench had not withdrawn from\n\ntheir long-term colony after\n\nWorld War II, making it easy for\n\ninsurgents to rally the nationalistic Vietnamese to their side.\n\nSecond, the charismatic, Soviettrained communist leader Ho Chi\n\nMinh had quickly consolidated\n\nhis anti-French power base just\n\nafter the war by assassinating the\n\nleadership of competing political\n\ngroups that were both antiFrench and anti-communist.\n\nThird, once the Korean War\n\narmistice was signed in 1953, the\n\nChinese had shifted large\n\namounts of sophisticated weaponry to Ho Chi Minh’s army. The\n\nViet Minh’s sudden acquisition of\n\nlarger-caliber weapons and ﬁeld\n\nartillery such as the 105-millimeter Howitzer abruptly changed\n\nthe nature of the war and contributed heavily to the French\n\nhumiliation at Dien Bien Phu.\n\nFourth, further war became\n\ninevitable when U.S.-led backers\n\nof the incipient South Vietnamese\n\ndemocracy called off a 1956\n\nAgain\n\nDo It\n\nSeptember 2003\n\n9\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nelection agreed upon after\n\nVietnam was divided in 1954. In\n\ngeopolitical terms, this failure to\n\ngo forward with elections was\n\nprudent, since it was clear a\n\ntotalitarian state had emerged in\n\nthe north. President Eisenhower’s\n\nfrequently quoted admonition\n\nthat Ho Chi Minh would get 75\n\npercent of the vote was not\n\npredicated on the communist\n\nleader’s popularity but on the\n\nimpossibility of getting a fair vote\n\nin communist-controlled North\n\nVietnam. But in propaganda\n\nterms, it solidiﬁed Ho Chi Minh’s\n\nstanding and in many eyes\n\njustiﬁed the renewed warfare he\n\nwould begin in the south two\n\nyears later.\n\n1963\n\nUnder President John F.\n\nKennedy’s three-year,\n\n$3 billion tax-cut package,\n\na typical family of four\n\nwith an annual income\n\nof $3,000 would pay $42,\n\nrather than $60, in\n\nfederal income taxes.\n\nSouth Vietnam President Ngo\n\nDinh Diem is assassinated.\n\nPresident Kennedy is\n\nassassinated in Dallas.\n\nIn 1958, the communists\n\nunleashed a terrorist campaign\n\nin the south. Within two years,\n\ntheir northern-trained squads\n\nwere assassinating an average of\n\n11 government ofﬁcials a day.\n\nPresident Kennedy referred to\n\nthis campaign in 1961 when he\n\ndecided to increase the number\n\nof American soldiers operating\n\ninside South Vietnam. “We have\n\ntalked about and read stories of\n\n7,000 to 15,000 guerrillas operating in Vietnam, killing 2,000 civil\n\nofﬁcers a year and 2,000 police\n\nofﬁcers a year – 4,000 total,”\n\nKennedy said. “How we ﬁght that\n\nkind of problem, which is going\n\nto be with us all through this\n\ndecade, seems to me to be one of\n\nthe great problems now before\n\nthe United States.”\n\nAmong the local populace, the\n\n10\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\ncommunist assassination squads\n\nwere the “stick,” threatening to\n\nkill anyone who ofﬁcially afﬁ liated with the South Vietnamese\n\ngovernment. Along with the\n\nassassination squads came the\n\n“carrot,” a highly trained political cadre that also inﬁ ltrated\n\nSouth Vietnam from the north.\n\nThe cadre helped the people\n\nprepare defenses in their villages,\n\ntook rice from farmers as taxes\n\nand recruited Viet Cong soldiers\n\nfrom the local young population.\n\nSpreading out into key areas –\n\nsuch as those provinces just\n\nbelow the demilitarized zone,\n\nthose bordering Laos and Cambodia, and those with future access\n\nroutes to key cities – the communists gained strong footholds.\n\nThe communists began spreading out from their enclaves,\n\nﬁghting on three levels simultaneously. First, they continued\n\ntheir terror campaign, assassinating local leaders, police ofﬁcers,\n\nteachers and others who declared\n\nsupport for the South Vietnamese\n\ngovernment. Second, they waged\n\nan effective small-unit guerrilla\n\nwar that was designed to disrupt\n\ncommerce, destroy morale and\n\nclasp local communities to their\n\ncause. And ﬁnally, beginning in\n\nlate 1964, they introduced\n\nconventional forces from the\n\nnorth, capable of facing, if not\n\ndefeating, main force infantry\n\nunits – including the Americans\n\n– on the battleﬁeld. Their gamble\n\nwas that once the United States\n\nbegan ﬁghting on a larger scale –\n\nas it did in March 1965 – its\n\npeople would not support a long\n\nwar of attrition. As Ho Chi Minh\n\nfamously put it, “For every one of\n\nyours we kill, you will kill 10 of\n\nours. But in the end it is you who\n\nwill grow tired.”\n\nHo Chi Minh was right. The\n\ninfamous “body counts” were\n\ncontinuously disparaged by the\n\nmedia and the antiwar movement. Hanoi removed the doubt in\n\n1995, when on the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon ofﬁcials\n\nadmitted having lost 1.1 million\n\ncombat soldiers dead, with\n\nanother 300,000 “still missing.”\n\nCommunist losses of 1.4\n\nmillion dead compared to Ameri-\n\nca’s losses of 58,000 and South\n\nVietnam’s 245,000 stand as stark\n\nevidence that eliminates many\n\nmyths about the war. The\n\ncommunists, and particularly the\n\nNorth Vietnamese, were excellent\n\nand determined soldiers. But the\n\n“wily, elusive guerrillas” that the\n\nmedia loved to portray were not\n\nexclusively wily, elusive or even\n\nguerrillas when one considers\n\nthat their combat deaths were\n\nfour times those of their enemies,\n\ncombined. And an American\n\nmilitary that located itself\n\nhalfway around the world to take\n\non a determined enemy on the\n\nterrain of the enemy’s choosing\n\nwas hardly the incompetent,\n\ndemoralized and confused force\n\nthat so many antiwar professors,\n\njournalists and ﬁlmmakers love\n\nto portray.\n\nWhy Did We Fight? The United\n\nStates recognized South Vietnam\n\nas a political entity separate from\n\nNorth Vietnam, just as it recognized West Germany as separate\n\nfrom communist-controlled East\n\nGermany and just as it continues\n\nto recognize South Korea from\n\ncommunist-controlled North\n\nKorea. As signatories of the\n\nSoutheast Asian Treaty Organization, we pledged to defend South\n\nVietnam from external aggression.\n\nSouth Vietnam was invaded by the\n\nnorth, just as certainly, although\n\nwith more sophistication, as South\n\nKorea was invaded by North\n\nKorea. The extent to which the\n\nNorth Vietnamese, as well as\n\nantiwar Americans, went to deny\n\nthis reality by pretending the war\n\nwas fought only by Viet Cong\n\nsoldiers from the south is, historically, one of the clearest examples\n\nof their disingenuous conduct. At\n\none point during the war, 15 of\n\nNorth Vietnam’s 16 combat\n\ndivisions were in the south.\n\nHow Did We Fight? The Vietnam\n\nWar varied year by year and\n\nregion by region, our military’s\n\nposture unavoidably mirroring\n\npolitical events in the United\n\nStates.

While reﬂecting\n\nAmerica’s ﬁnal months in Vietnam, they hardly tell the story of\n\nthe years of effort and battleﬁeld\n\nsuccess that preceded them.\n\nLittle recognition has been\n\ngiven in this country of how\n\nbrutal the war was for those who\n\nfought it on the ground and how\n\nwell our military performed.\n\nDropped onto the enemy’s terrain\n\n12,000 miles away from home,\n\nAmerica’s citizen-soldiers performed with a tenacity and\n\nquality that may never be truly\n\n1963\n\nThe ZIP code is born.\n\nThe Rambler is Motor Trend\n\nmagazine’s Car of the Year.\n\nAveraging 143.137 mph,\n\nParnelli Jones wins the\n\nIndianapolis 500.\n\nunderstood. Those who believe\n\nthe war was fought incompetently\n\non a tactical level should consider\n\nthe enormous casualties to which\n\nthe communists now admit. And\n\nthose who believe that it was a\n\n“dirty little war” where the bombs\n\ndid all the work might contemplate that it was the most costly\n\nwar the U.S. Marine Corps has\n\never fought. Five times as many\n\nMarines died in Vietnam as in\n\nWorld War I, three times as many\n\nas in Korea. And the Marines\n\nsuffered more total casualties,\n\nkilled and wounded, in Vietnam\n\nthan in all of World War II.\n\nAnother allegation was that our\n\nsoldiers were over-decorated\n\nduring the Vietnam War. James\n\nFallows says in his book “National Defense” that by 1971, we had\n\ngiven out almost 1.3 million\n\nmedals for bravery in Vietnam, as\n\nopposed to some 1.7 million for\n\nall of World War II. Others have\n\nrepeated the ﬁgure, including the\n\nBritish historian Richard Holmes\n\nin his book “Acts of War.” This\n\ncomparison is incorrect for a\n\n12\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\nnumber of reasons. First, these\n\ntotals included air medals, rarely\n\nawarded for bravery. We awarded\n\nmore than 1 million air medals to\n\nArmy soldiers during Vietnam.\n\nAir medals were almost always\n\ngiven on a points basis for\n\nmissions ﬂown, and it was not\n\nunusual to see a helicopter pilot\n\nwith 40 air medals because of the\n\nnature of his job.\n\nIf we compare the top three\n\nactual gallantry awards, the\n\nArmy awarded:\n\nn 289 Medals of Honor in\n\nWorld War II and 155 in Vietnam.\n\nn 4,434 Distinguished Service\n\nCrosses in World War II and 846\n\nin Vietnam.\n\nn 73,651 Silver Stars in World\n\nWar II against 21,630 in Vietnam.\n\nThe Marine Corps, which lost\n\n103,000 killed or wounded out of\n\nsome 400,000 sent to Vietnam,\n\nawarded 47 Medals of Honor (34\n\nposthumously), 362 Navy Crosses\n\n(139 posthumously) and 2,592\n\nSilver Stars.\n\nSecond, although the Army\n\nawarded another 1.3 million\n\n“meritorious” Bronze Stars and\n\nArmy Commendation Medals in\n\nVietnam, this was hardly unique.\n\nAfter World War II, Army Regulation 600-45 authorized every\n\nsoldier who had received either a\n\nCombat Infantryman’s Badge or a\n\nCombat Medical Badge to also be\n\nawarded a meritorious Bronze\n\nStar. The Army has no data\n\nregarding how many soldiers\n\nreceived Bronze Stars through\n\nthis blanket procedure.\n\nAtrocities? We made errors,\n\nalthough nowhere on the scale\n\nalleged by those who have a\n\nstake in disparaging our effort.\n\nFighting a well-trained enemy\n\nwho seeks cover in highly\n\ncontested populated areas where\n\ncivilians often assist the other\n\nside is the most difﬁcult form of\n\nwarfare. The most important\n\ndistinction is that the deliberate\n\nkilling of innocent civilians was\n\na crime in the U.S. military. We\n\nheld ourselves accountable for\n\nMy Lai. And yet we are still\n\nwaiting for the communists to\n\ntake responsibility for the\n\nthousands of civilians deliber-\n\nately killed by their political\n\ncadre as a matter of policy. A\n\ngood place for them to start\n\nholding their own forces accountable would be Hue, where during\n\nthe 1968 Tet Offensive more than\n\n2,000 locals were systematically\n\nexecuted during the brief communist takeover of the city.\n\nWhat Went Wrong? Beyond the\n\nbattleﬁeld, just about everything\n\none might imagine.\n\nThe war was begun, and\n\nfought, without clear political\n\ngoals. Its battleﬁeld complexities\n\nwere never fully understood by\n\nthose who were judging, and\n\ncommenting upon, American\n\nperformance. As a riﬂe platoon\n\nand company commander in the\n\ninfamous An Hoa Basin west of\n\nDa Nang, on any given day my\n\nMarines could be ﬁghting three\n\ndifferent wars: one against\n\nterrorism, one against guerrillas\n\nand one against conventional\n\nforces. The implications of these\n\nchallenges, as well as our successes in dealing with them,\n\nnever seemed to penetrate an\n\nAmerican populace inundated by\n\nnegative press stories ﬁ led by\n\nreporters, particularly television\n\njournalists, who had no clue\n\nabout the real tempo of the war.\n\nAnd one of the most underreported revelations after the war\n\nended was that several top\n\nreporters were compromised\n\nwhile in Vietnam, by communist\n\nagents who had managed to gain\n\nemployment as their assistants,\n\nthus shaping in a large way their\n\nreporting.\n\nMost importantly, Vietnam\n\nbecame an undeclared war fought\n\nagainst the background of a\n\nhighly organized dissent movement at home. Few Americans\n\nwho grew up after the war know\n\nthat a large part of this dissent\n\nmovement was already in place\n\nbefore the Vietnam War began.\n\nMany who wished for revolutionary changes in America had\n\npushed for them through the\n\nvehicles of groups such as the\n\nban-the-bomb movement in the\n\n1950s and the civil-rights movement of the early and mid-1960s.\n\nIn this regard, it is interesting to\n\nnote that the infamous antiwar\n\ngroup Students for a Democratic\n\nSociety was created at the University of Michigan through the Port\n\nHuron Statement in 1962 – three\n\nfull years before American\n\nground troops landed at Da Nang.\n\nThe SDS hoped to bring revolution to America through the issue\n\nof race. They and other extremist\n\ngroups soon found more fertile\n\nsoil on the issue of the war.\n\nFormer communist colonel Bui\n\nTin, a highly placed propaganda\n\nofﬁcer during the war, recently\n\npublished a memoir in which he\n\nspeciﬁcally admitted a truth that\n\nwas assumed by American\n\nﬁghting men for years. The Hanoi\n\ngovernment assumed from the\n\n1963\n\nThe average annual\n\nincome is $5,807.\n\nA new house costs\n\nan average of $12,650.\n\nA loaf of bread is 22 cents.\n\nbeginning that the United States\n\nwould never prevail in Vietnam\n\nso long as the dissent movement,\n\nwhich they called “the Rear\n\nFront,” was successful at home.\n\nMany top leaders of this movement coordinated efforts directly\n\nwith Vietnamese communist\n\nofﬁcials in Hanoi. Such coordination often included visiting the\n\nNorth Vietnamese capital – for\n\ninstance, during the planning\n\nstages for the October 1967\n\nmarch on the Pentagon – a few\n\nweeks before the siege of Khe\n\nSanh kicked into high gear and a\n\nfew months before the Tet\n\nOffensive.\n\nThe majority of the American\n\npeople never truly bought the\n\nantiwar movement’s logic. While\n\nit is correct to say many wearied\n\nof an ineffective national strategy\n\nas the war dragged on, they never\n\nstopped supporting the actual\n\ngoals for which the United States\n\nand South Vietnam fought. As late\n\nas September 1972, a Harris\n\nsurvey indicated overwhelming\n\nsupport for continued bombing of\n\nNorth Vietnam – 55 percent to 32\n\n14\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\npercent – and for mining North\n\nVietnamese harbors – 64 percent\n\nto 22 percent. By a margin of 74\n\npercent to 11 percent, those polled\n\nalso agreed that “it is important\n\nthat South Vietnam not fall into\n\nthe control of the communists.”\n\nWas It Worth It? On a human\n\nlevel, the war brought tragedy to\n\nhundreds of thousands of American homes through death, disabling wounds and psychological\n\nscars. Many other Vietnam\n\nveterans were stigmatized by their\n\nown peers as a classic Greek\n\ntragedy played out before the\n\nnation’s eyes. Those who did not\n\ngo, particularly among the nation’s\n\nelites, were often threatened by\n\nthe acts of those who did and as a\n\nconsequence inverted the usual\n\nsyllogism of service. If I did not go\n\nto a war because I believed it was\n\nimmoral, what does it say about\n\nsomeone who did? If someone\n\nwho fought is perceived as having\n\nbeen honorable, what does that\n\nsay about someone who was asked\n\nto and could have but did not?\n\nVietnam veterans, most of\n\nwhom entered the military just\n\nafter leaving high school, had\n\ntheir educational and professional lives interrupted during their\n\nmost formative years. In many\n\nparts of the country and in many\n\nprofessional arenas, their having\n\nserved their country was a\n\nnegative when it came to admission into universities or being\n\nhired for jobs. The fact that the\n\noverwhelming majority of those\n\nwho served were able to persist\n\nand make successful lives for\n\nthemselves and their families is\n\nstrong testament to the quality of\n\nAmericans who actually did step\n\nforward and serve.\n\nOn a national level, and in the\n\neyes of history, the answer is\n\neasier. One can gain an appreciation for what we attempted to\n\nachieve in Vietnam by examining\n\nthe aftermath of the communist\n\nvictory in 1975. A gruesome\n\nholocaust took place in Cambodia, the likes of which had not\n\nbeen seen since World War II.\n\nTwo million Vietnamese ﬂed their\n\ncountry – mostly by boat. Thousands lost their lives in the\n\nprocess. This was the ﬁrst such\n\ndiaspora in Vietnam’s long and\n\nfrequently tragic history. Inside\n\nVietnam, a million of the south’s\n\nbest young leaders were sent to\n\nre-education camps; more than\n\n50,000 perished while imprisoned, and others remained\n\ncaptives for as long as 18 years.\n\nAn apartheid system was put into\n\nplace that punished those who\n\nhad been loyal to the United\n\nStates, as well as their families, in\n\nmatters of education, employment\n\nand housing. The Soviet Union\n\nmade Vietnam a client state until\n\nits own demise, pumping billions\n\nof dollars into the country and\n\nkeeping extensive naval and air\n\nbases at Cam Ranh Bay. In fact,\n\ncommunist Vietnam did not truly\n\nstart opening up to the outside\n\nworld until the Soviet Union\n\nceased to exist.\n\nWould I Do It Again? Others are\n\nwelcome to disagree, but on this I\n\nhave no doubt. Like almost every\n\nMarine I have ever met, my\n\nstrongest regret is that perhaps I\n\ncould have done more. But no\n\nother experience in my life has\n\nbeen more important than the\n\nchallenge of leading Marines\n\nduring those extraordinarily\n\ndifﬁcult times. Nor am I alone in\n\nthis feeling.

Additionally, 89\n\npercent agreed that “our troops\n\nwere asked to ﬁght in a war which\n\nour political leaders in Washington would not let them win.”\n\nOn that ﬁnal question, history\n\nwill surely be kinder to those who\n\nfought than to those who directed\n\n– or opposed – the war. n\n\nJames Webb served as a riﬂe\n\nplatoon and company commander\n\nwith the Fifth Marine Regiment in\n\nVietnam.

Westmoreland remains\n\nproud of his soldiers.\n\nBY JOHN RAUGHTER\n\nt the dawn of the Vietnam War,\n\nWilliam C. Westmoreland was on top of the\n\nworld. A respected superintendent of the U.S.\n\nMilitary Academy, “Westy” had already\n\ndistinguished himself in two wars. The\n\nramrod straight, silver-haired southern\n\ngentleman was by all accounts a great\n\nsoldier, dubbed “the inevitable general”\n\nby his West Point classmates.\n\nComparisons to Robert E. Lee were\n\nnatural. He was an obvious choice for\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson to appoint\n\ncommander of Military Assistance\n\nCommand, Vietnam. In 1965,\n\nWestmoreland was the toast of\n\nthe town when Time named him\n\n“Man of the Year.” Yet, just two\n\nyears later, he was burned in efﬁgy\n\non college campuses across\n\nAmerica. And like Lee, he also\n\nwas denied the ﬁnal victory he\n\nso desperately wanted.\n\nA\n\nGen. William C. Westmoreland was\n\ncommander of Military Assistance\n\nCommand, Vietnam, from 1964 to\n\n1968. Corbis\n\n‘A lot of people in the media\n\nthought they were smarter than\n\neverybody else. But they were\n\nin an environment that they\n\ndidn’t understand.’\n\nAt 89, some memories have\n\ndimmed for the retired general,\n\nbut the military feistiness\n\nremains. Aware that many\n\nhistorians and journalists have\n\ncriticized his Vietnam leadership, Westmoreland told The\n\nAmerican Legion Magazine in\n\n2002, “I don’t give a damn.\n\nWhen you’re in a position of\n\nauthority, you do the best you\n\ncan. Lives were at stake.”\n\nCritics contend that Westmoreland was deceptively light in\n\nestimates of enemy troop\n\nstrength that he reported to his\n\nsuperiors in Washington. The\n\ngeneral vehemently denies the\n\ncharge. In a 1984 libel suit he\n\nﬁ led against CBS, Westmoreland\n\ntestiﬁed that the numbers he\n\nused were “people we wanted to\n\ndestroy in a military way.” The\n\nhigher numbers he is accused of\n\nignoring were not an offensive\n\nforce, Westmoreland says, but\n\nwomen, children and old men.\n\nWestmoreland later withdrew\n\nthe lawsuit, but the absence of\n\nmedia presence in his daily life\n\nhas not made his heart grow\n\nfonder. “A lot of people in the\n\nmedia thought they were smarter\n\nthan everybody else,” Westmoreland says of those who covered\n\nVietnam. “But they were in an\n\nenvironment that they didn’t\n\nunderstand.”\n\nHe points to the Tet Offensive\n\nas a speciﬁc instance where the\n\nmedia got it wrong. “It was a\n\ngreat victory for Americans, but\n\nthey were told otherwise.”\n\nToday, Westmoreland and his\n\nwife of 56 years, Kitsy, divide\n\ntheir time between a retirement\n\nhome near Charleston, S.C., and\n\ntheir mountain cabin in Cashiers, N.C. Although decades\n\nago Westmoreland was a lightning rod for those dissatisﬁed\n\nwith the war’s progress and for\n\nothers who felt America should\n\nnot be in Vietnam at all, to many\n\nAmericans Westmoreland\n\nremains a hero. His place in\n\nhistory is as conﬂ icted as it is\n\nmisunderstood.\n\n“The American people don’t\n\nknow who I am and don’t give a\n\ndamn who I am. They don’t\n\nknow about war. They don’t\n\nunderstand war.”\n\n“Now Westy,” Kitsy says, “we\n\ncan never go to a ﬁ lling station\n\nIke: Westy had it tougher\n\nHistorians have often pondered how great generals from different\n\neras would have performed in Vietnam. MACV commander Gen.\n\nWilliam C. Westmoreland himself often wondered. In the biography\n\n“Westmoreland: The Inevitable General,” Ernest B. Furgurson\n\nreports that during a wartime dinner party, Westmoreland surveyed\n\nhis colonels and generals on how World War II generals would have\n\nﬁt into the Vietnam War. Their conclusion: the smartest generals\n\nwould be successful in any war, but “the full-speed-ahead types like\n\nPatton would be hopeless in a war like that in Vietnam.”\n\nWestmoreland had the solid support of one great World War II\n\ngeneral: former President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Notes at the\n\nJohnson Library reveal a candid discussion between presidents\n\nJohnson and Eisenhower in 1968 at Eisenhower’s winter home in\n\nPalm Desert, Calif. A war-weary Johnson seeking military advice\n\nfrom Eisenhower was taken aback when Eisenhower refused to\n\nsecond-guess the commander in the ﬁeld. Westmoreland had “the\n\ngreatest responsibility of any general I have ever known in history,”\n\nEisenhower told a startled Johnson.\n\nJohnson reminded Eisenhower that Westmoreland commanded\n\nonly 500,000 troops, as opposed to the 5 million Ike commanded\n\nduring the invasion of Nazi-controlled Europe. “Westmoreland’s\n\njob is tougher,” Eisenhower said. “I always knew where the\n\nenemy was.”\n\n– J.R.\n\nSeptember 2003\n\n17\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nor anyplace without someone\n\ncoming up to you and paying\n\nrespects.” He admits this is true\n\nand quickly gives in.\n\nHis criticisms of the media,\n\nwar protesters and his old boss,\n\nDefense Secretary Robert S.\n\nMcNamara, are more matter-offact and less bitter than they\n\nonce were.\n\nOf McNamara’s 1995 memoir,\n\nwhich contained an apology\n\nfor U.S. policy in Vietnam,\n\nWestmoreland charitably says,\n\n“I admired him for it. It took\n\na lot of courage.”\n\n“You were mad as hops at\n\nhim,” Kitsy gently reminds him.\n\n“When that book came out, you\n\ndidn’t like it.”\n\n1964\n\nSoviet leader Nikita\n\nKhruschev falls from grace\n\nwith the Communist Party\n\nand is deposed from ofﬁce.\n\nThe Beatles top the\n\ncharts with “I Want\n\nto Hold Your Hand.”\n\nCivil rights leader\n\nRev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nis awarded the Nobel\n\nPeace Prize.\n\nThe Ford Motor Co.\n\nintroduces the sporty\n\nnew Mustang. Sticker\n\nprice: $2,368.\n\nA brief pause follows. “McNamara was a bright man, but not\n\nas bright as he thought he was,”\n\nWestmoreland adds. “Particularly on military matters.”\n\nThe Westmorelands’ devotion\n\nfor each other might be expected\n\nfrom a couple still together\n\nnearly 70 years after ﬁ rst meeting. But that devotion also faced\n\ngreat tests. Commanding troops\n\nin a war wasn’t just a job to\n\nWestmoreland; it was how he\n\nwas to be deﬁ ned by history.\n\nAnd, during the time, it was how\n\nhis family was to be deﬁ ned.\n\nIn 1965, after a series of\n\nattacks by Viet Cong terrorists,\n\nPresident Johnson ordered the\n\nevacuation of all U.S. military\n\n18\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\ndependents from Vietnam. Kitsy\n\nand the three Westmoreland\n\nchildren moved to Hawaii, where\n\nKitsy faced verbal attacks by\n\nantiwar activists, vandalization\n\nof the family’s home and an\n\nerroneous radio report of her\n\nhusband’s assassination. The\n\natmosphere grew so intense that\n\nKitsy and the children moved to\n\nthe Philippines, while her\n\nhusband, a decorated veteran of\n\ntwo previous American wars,\n\nserved in Vietnam.\n\nAll war commanders bear the\n\nburdens that come with the loss\n\nof life. But Westmoreland was\n\ntouched personally by it as well.\n\nKitsy’s brother, Lt. Col. Frederick\n\nF. Van Deusen, died when his\n\nhelicopter was shot down over\n\nthe Mekong River. Westmoreland\n\nlearned the news just hours\n\nbefore he was promoted to Army\n\nchief of staff in Washington. He\n\ndid not tell Kitsy until after the\n\nceremony.\n\nDespite their close friendship,\n\nWestmoreland and Johnson often\n\nhad tactical disagreements.\n\nWestmoreland wanted more\n\ntroops and strikes against\n\nCambodia and Laos, hotbeds for\n\nenemy activity. Johnson would\n\nnot listen.\n\n“He had many advisers –\n\nMcNamara was one of them,”\n\nWestmoreland recalls. “They\n\nwere afraid China would enter\n\nthe war.” Despite their disagreements, the public perception that\n\nthe president and the commander were close friends was an\n\naccurate one, he says. “I got to\n\nknow LBJ pretty well. He had\n\ngood personal instincts and,\n\nearly on, thought I was after his\n\njob. Once I assured him that I\n\nwasn’t, we got along ﬁ ne.”\n\nAssuring others, however, was\n\nnot so easy.\n\nIn 1967, the South Carolina\n\nGeneral Assembly passed a\n\nresolution “to prevail upon”\n\nWestmoreland to enter the\n\npresidential race. But Westmoreland was a soldier and strongly\n\nbelieved soldiers should loyally\n\nfollow the orders of their civilian\n\nleaders. The Constitution demanded it, and Johnson demanded it. “I hope you don’t pull a\n\nMacArthur on me,” Johnson told\n\nWestmoreland early in the\n\nVietnam War, clearly referring to\n\nGen. Douglas MacArthur’s\n\nchallenge of Truman’s Korean\n\nWar policies.\n\nIt was Westmoreland’s loyalty\n\nto Johnson, an increasingly\n\nunpopular president leading an\n\nunpopular war, that diminished\n\nWestmoreland’s own standing\n\namong many Americans.\n\n“I guess the people did not see\n\nthe relevance of that war to our\n\nnational interest,” he says.\n\n“Unlike World War II, our\n\nsecurity was not threatened.”\n\nThe outcome of that war,\n\nWestmoreland believes, could\n\nhave been different if Congress\n\nhad been willing to enforce the\n\nprovisions of the Paris cease-ﬁ re\n\nagreement. Instead, as a weakened President Nixon attempted\n\nto survive the Watergate scandal,\n\nlawmakers banned all forms of\n\nU.S. military assistance to\n\nVietnam.\n\nWhen Saigon fell, Westmoreland was hospitalized for previously undisclosed reasons. The\n\ngeneral and Kitsy now admit it\n\nwas a stress-induced heart\n\nattack. “Anger and sorrow” is\n\nhow he describes his emotions at\n\nthe time.\n\nThe Vietnam War, Westmoreland believes, was not a failure\n\nof America’s soldiers. “They did\n\na heck of a good job,” he says.\n\nKitsy wants history to similarly remember her husband.\n\n“He was an honorable man who\n\nlived honor, duty, country in\n\nevery way.”\n\nDuring the war, Westmoreland\n\nkept a written quote on his desk\n\nto remind him why America was\n\nin Vietnam. Ironically, it came\n\nfrom a man who many in the\n\nantiwar movement also respected. “Let every nation know,”\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy said,\n\n“whether it wishes us well or ill,\n\nthat we shall pay any price, bear\n\nany burden, meet any hardship,\n\nsupport any friend, oppose any\n\nfoe to assure the survival and\n\nsuccess of liberty.” n\n\nJohn Raughter is editor of The\n\nAmerican Legion Magazine.\n\nLEGENDS OF\n\nSHOT GLASS\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nGlasses at left, the 1913 Gold Medal Commemorative glass\n\nand the Old No.7 Black Label glass.\n\nDisplay shown smaller than actual size of 15 7⁄8\" high by 14 5⁄8\" wide.\n\nThe inside story on Jack Daniel’s®\n\nis on the outside of these fine glasses.\n\nThere’s a bit of history in every sip of Jack Daniel’s®.

Corbis\n\ncommentary\n\nBY JIM BOHANNON\n\nuch has been written about media bias during the\n\nVietnam War. Without doubt, it can be said the\n\nenemy viewed reporters as tools for achieving their\n\ngoal of victory. “Our purpose is, through a progression\n\nof all-out attacks, to cause many U.S. casualties and so\n\nerode the U.S. will that the antiwar inﬂuences will gain\n\ndecisive political strength,” said Pham Van Dong,\n\nformer prime minister of North Vietnam. Moreover, Ho\n\nChi Minh famously predicted, “For every one of yours\n\nwe kill, you will kill 10 of ours. But in the end, it is you\n\nwho will grow tired.”\n\nM\n\nTheir strategy of winning away\n\nfrom the battleﬁeld worked – an\n\nespecially fortunate circumstance\n\nfor the communist cause, since\n\nthey never came close to winning\n\non the battleﬁeld against U.S.\n\nforces.\n\nThe biggest single question of\n\nmedia inﬂuence on the outcome\n\nof the Vietnam War centers on\n\nthe Tet Offensive of Jan. 31, 1968,\n\nand ample evidence shows that\n\nheadlines dealt a lot more with\n\nexpectations than fact.\n\nTrue, North Vietnamese\n\nregular army forces and the Viet\n\nCong guerrillas attacked Saigon\n\nand most provincial capitals,\n\nbrieﬂy overrunning some. But\n\nexcept in the old imperial city of\n\nHue, these communist occupations were principally measured\n\nin hours. When Tet was over,\n\nHanoi had gained exactly zero\n\nterritory and lost thousands of\n\ntroops. The North Vietnamese\n\nArmy suffered severe losses. The\n\nViet Cong were never again a\n\nsigniﬁcant factor in the war. It\n\nwas one of the most lopsided\n\nmilitary defeats in history – for\n\nthe communists, that is. But U.S.\n\nnews stories harped on earlier\n\nexpectations of light at the end of\n\nthe tunnel. Those expectations\n\nmay indeed have been too rosy,\n\nespecially given the decision not\n\nto prosecute the war to win, as\n\nwas well within our capabilities.\n\nBut that doesn’t alter the facts:\n\nthe United States and its allies\n\nwon decisively, and any honest\n\nreporting of Tet must be in that\n\ncontext. Victory should have\n\nbeen the lead to the story. But\n\nmost coverage dwelled on how\n\nthis was more than the communists had been expected to do, as\n\nif there were any doubt that they\n\ncould temporarily grab some\n\nterritory if they were willing to\n\nvirtually commit suicide.\n\nIn his book “Vietnam, the\n\nNecessary War,” journalist\n\nMichael Lind cites sensationalism\n\nas the reason Western journalists\n\nexaggerated the power and\n\npopularity of the Viet Cong. But\n\nin terms of Pham Van Dong’s\n\ndesire to erode U.S. will, Tet and\n\nits news coverage were the\n\nturning points.\n\nAnother battle that lasted\n\nthrough and beyond Tet also\n\ndeserves mention for what some\n\nperceived as a historical parallel.\n\nAs James Grifﬁths, a veteran of\n\nthe 11th Armored Cavalry, notes\n\nin his book “Vietnam Insights,”\n\ngloomy media depictions were\n\nnot limited to the Saigon area but\n\nalso occurred at the northern\n\nMarine base at Khe Sanh during\n\nTet. Bob Young of ABC and\n\nWalter Cronkite of CBS linked the\n\nvictorious general of Dien Bien\n\nPhu, Vo Nguyen Giap, to the\n\nsiege at Khe Sanh, and Time put\n\nhim on its cover. It was as if\n\nGiap’s presence would cause a\n\nMarine defeat at Khe Sanh to be\n\na foregone conclusion. Newsweek\n\njumped on the antiwar bandwagon with its March 18, 1968, issue.\n\nUsing the Khe Sanh ammo dump\n\nexplosion as its cover, it failed to\n\nlet readers know that the incident\n\nhad occurred two months earlier,\n\nconcluding, “Though the U.S.\n\ndilemma at Khe Sanh is particularly acute, it is not unique. It\n\nsimply reﬂects in microcosm the\n\nentire U.S. military position in\n\nVietnam. U.S. strategy up to this\n\npoint has been a failure.”\n\nWilliam Jayne, a Marine\n\nveteran of Khe Sanh said, “The\n\nNorth Vietnamese never mounted\n\na determined ground offensive\n\nagainst us.” Sadly almost 200\n\nAmericans died there, but\n\ncompare that to the 14,000 enemy\n\ndeath count. However, neither\n\nbattle provided the dramatic\n\nimpact of two photographs.\n\nThe ﬁrst is of Kim Phuc, the\n\nlittle girl running from a napalm\n\nattack that burned her clothes off.\n\nB.G. Burkett writes in his book\n\n“Stolen Valor” that this “became\n\nthe perfect illustration of America’s ‘indiscriminate’ napalming of\n\ncivilians. A picture may be worth\n\na thousand words, but it also can\n\ndistort reality. There were no\n\nAmerican planes involved, and\n\nthere were no American ground\n\ntroops at the scene. It happened\n\nin June 1972, when a South\n\nVietnamese Skyraider dropped\n\nnapalm on orders of a South\n\nVietnamese ofﬁcer, after almost\n\nall American combat units had\n\nbeen withdrawn. Following the\n\nfall of South Vietnam, the communists tried to use Kim Phuc\n\nand her injuries as propaganda\n\nagainst the Americans. But she\n\nrebelled, ﬂeeing to the West. She\n\nnow lives in Toronto.” And yet, as\n\nJames Grifﬁths notes, as late as\n\n1992, Time made reference to “the\n\n1972 photo of children ﬂeeing an\n\nAmerican napalm strike.”\n\nSeptember 2003\n\n21\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nGrifﬁths wrote Time with a\n\ncorrection and received a letter\n\nback thanking him. Time refused,\n\nthough, to print Grifﬁths’ letter or\n\nany correction.\n\nThe second dramatic photo is\n\nthe pistol shot ﬁ red by a South\n\nVietnamese ofﬁcial into the head\n\nof a captured Viet Cong. It\n\nhappened during the Tet offensive, when South Vietnamese\n\nNational Police Chief Gen.\n\nNguyen Loc Loan executed Bay\n\nLop in the streets of Saigon.\n\nGrifﬁths writes, “This incident\n\ndoes show the horror and\n\nbrutality of war, but it has been\n\nportrayed for the most part as\n\nunprovoked. Photographer Eddie\n\nAdams said Lop ‘was the same\n\n1964\n\nCongress votes in favor of a\n\nresolution to give President\n\nJohnson greater authority\n\nto strike back against\n\ncommunists in North Vietnam.\n\nU.S. combat deaths in\n\nVietnam total 136. Another\n\n1,022 are wounded, and 11\n\nare listed as MIA.\n\nPresident Johnson signs the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nMinimum wage is $1.25\n\nan hour.\n\nguy who killed one of Loan’s\n\nofﬁcers and wiped out his whole\n\nfamily.’” Former South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Cao\n\nKy writes in his book “Buddha’s\n\nChild” that Lop was captured\n\n“carrying papers identifying\n\nhimself as a Viet Cong captain in\n\nthe act of murdering a police\n\nsergeant, his wife and three\n\nsmall children. The guerrilla\n\nwore civilian clothes. The\n\nGeneva Conventions do not\n\nextend the protections of prisoner-of-war status to spies,\n\nmercenaries and guerrillas who\n\nfail to distinguish themselves\n\nfrom civilians.” Burkett notes\n\nsimilar executions of German\n\nsaboteurs during World War II’s\n\nBattle of the Bulge, without\n\ntrials. “Gen. Eisenhower was\n\n22\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\ncompletely within his authority\n\nto order the executions. So was\n\nGen. Loan.” The difference was\n\nthe treatment by the press and\n\nthe fact that Loan performed the\n\nexecution personally. When did\n\nyou read press reports of VCdirected children dropping hand\n\ngrenades near American GIs?\n\nHave you read any Tet press\n\nreports noting that communist\n\nforces sent in kids high on opium\n\nas a ﬁ rst wave, carrying sticks,\n\nto be used as cannon fodder by\n\ndrawing tracer ﬁ re and revealing\n\nAmerican positions to the second\n\nwave, the ones with the AK-47s?\n\nThese are merely the major omissions and distortions. There were\n\nothers.\n\nRetired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub cites in his book, “Hazardous Duty,” an American magazine article about ARVN ofﬁcers\n\nwho were more interested in\n\nprocuring prostitutes for GIs than\n\nwaging war. Singlaub’s senior\n\nembassy adviser encountered the\n\nreporter who wrote the article\n\nand “lit into him over the piece.”\n\nThe reporter said, “I ﬁ led my\n\nstory citing that as VC propaganda. But my editors rewrote it the\n\nway they wanted.”\n\nThen there’s the case of the\n\nPentagon Papers, covered by\n\nEdward Jay Epstein, author of\n\n“Between Fact and Fiction: The\n\nproblem of Journalism.” This\n\nclassiﬁed DoD study on U.S.\n\ninvolvement in Indochina was\n\nsecretly copied by Daniel Ellsberg, a former government\n\nofﬁcial then working at the\n\nRAND Corp. He delivered it to an\n\noutspoken critic of the war, New\n\nYork Times reporter Neil Sheehan. Epstein notes, “In comparing the Times reports with the\n\nactual text of the Pentagon study,\n\nit becomes clear that the Times\n\nversion is something more than a\n\nsimple paraphrasing of the secret\n\nhistory, or even an abridged\n\n‘rendering.’ Substantial revisions\n\nin the history were made on\n\nmajor issues.” The Times reported, “The Johnson administration\n\nreached a ‘general consensus’ at\n\na White House strategy meeting\n\non Sept. 7, 1964, that air attacks\n\nagainst North Vietnam would\n\nprobably have to be launched.\n\nThe administration consensus on\n\nbombing came at the height of\n\nthe presidential election between\n\nPresident Johnson and Sen. Barry\n\nGoldwater, whose advocacy of\n\nfull-scale air attacks on North\n\nVietnam had become an issue.”\n\nEpstein notes that none of the\n\nactions recommended at the\n\nSept. 7 meeting involved American bombing of North Vietnam,\n\nand that three days later the\n\nadministration ruled out any\n\nbombing of the north, either by\n\nthe United States or South\n\nVietnam.\n\nLind notes cases of admitted\n\nbias, such as the 1967 report ﬁ led\n\nby Mary McCarthy, which began,\n\n“I confess that when I went to\n\nVietnam early last February I\n\nwas looking for material damaging to the American interest.”\n\nOthers were more ambiguous.\n\nIn his book “A Better War,” thirdgeneration West Pointer Lewis\n\nSorley notes that Cronkite, in his\n\nmemoirs, writes, “A generation of\n\nofﬁcers later, there still lurks in\n\nthe Pentagon the belief that the\n\nmedia lost the war.” But then Sorley skips ahead 100 or so pages,\n\nto ﬁnd Cronkite writing with\n\napparent pride, “The daily\n\ncoverage of the Vietnamese\n\nbattleﬁeld helped convince the\n\nAmerican public that the carnage\n\nwas not worth the candle.”\n\nWhile few media members\n\nwere out to harm their country, a\n\ncombination of subjective\n\nreporting, ignorance of war and\n\nignorance of the historical\n\ncontext of our involvement in\n\nIndochina combined to provide\n\ncoverage of that conﬂ ict which\n\nwas often misleading and sometimes erroneous. No matter how\n\none feels about the war, few can\n\ndeny that the enemy would have\n\napproved of the coverage. n\n\nJim Bohannon served in the U.S.\n\nArmy Security Agency from 1966\n\nto 1970 and in Vietnam from 1967\n\nto 1968 with the 199th Light\n\nInfantry Brigade “Redcatchers.”\n\nHis radio talk show is broadcast\n\non nearly 500 stations through\n\nWestwood One Radio.

But Hemphill is\n\nuniquely motivated to press his\n\ncomplaint – his former unit and\n\nhe, himself, were falsely portrayed on screen by Hollywood\n\ndirector Oliver Stone in the 1986\n\nmovie “Platoon.”\n\n“That really hit home,” says\n\nHemphill, who was moved to\n\nwrite a book and speak publicly,\n\nurging veterans to tell the truth.\n\nHemphill began his crusade in\n\n1987 after watching the movie.\n\n“Platoon,” which centers on\n\nan American infantry unit in\n\nVietnam, depicts U.S. soldiers\n\nsmoking dope, assaulting villagers and attempting to kill one\n\n24\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\nanother. Ultimately, their commander calls in an air strike on\n\nhis own position.\n\n“The movie was completely\n\ndistorted,” Hemphill says, “and\n\nnothing like my own experience\n\nor that of anyone I knew.”\n\nHemphill was appalled that the\n\nﬁ lm identiﬁed his old unit, Bravo\n\nCompany, 3rd Battalion, 25th\n\nInfantry Division. He was more\n\nshocked when he realized Stone\n\nwas a riﬂeman in the unit.\n\n“I was stunned,” Hemphill\n\nsays. “Stone was a good soldier. I\n\ncould not believe he would create\n\nthis distortion about the people\n\nhe served with.”\n\nWhen Hemphill confronted\n\nStone, he claimed he had used\n\nartistic license. Stone did not\n\nrespond to repeated requests to\n\ndiscuss the matter with The\n\nAmerican Legion Magazine.\n\nHemphill then began to reexamine the underpinnings of\n\nother Vietnam-themed movies.\n\n“Some were in fact very\n\nstraightforward,” Hemphill says.\n\n“Hamburger Hill,” for example, is\n\na traditional combat movie based\n\nin Vietnam. And not all ﬁ lms\n\ndenounce American involvement\n\nin Indochina. John Wayne’s “The\n\nGreen Berets” clearly supports\n\nthe U.S. presence.\n\nAntiwar Scripts. The reason for\n\nthe imbalance is twofold. “When\n\nthe veterans came home from the\n\nwar, they didn’t talk about it,” he\n\nsays. “But the protesters did.”\n\nThe antiwar movement spoke\n\nso stridently that its views\n\ndominated national dialogue.\n\nSome of the most eloquent voices\n\nmigrated to Hollywood.\n\n“For the most part, the scripts\n\nabout Vietnam came from the\n\nantiwar movement,” Hemphill\n\nsays. “So they presented only one\n\nside – a distorted side.”\n\nContrary to Hollywood mythmaking, the American soldier\n\nfought the war honorably.\n\nThe popular image of the\n\nVietnam serviceman as a murderous, drug-addled malcontent\n\nis a complete misrepresentation,\n\nHemphill says. “There were\n\nisolated incidents that received so\n\nmuch press for that very reason:\n\nthey were out of character. But to\n\napply an anomaly to an entire\n\ngroup is wrong. It’s a disservice\n\nto the men who served.”\n\nHemphill challenged the image\n\nby writing a book, “Platoon:\n\nBravo Company,” chronicling the\n\ntrue story of his unit. Hemphill\n\nsent copies to former platoon\n\nmembers. All the men – eyewitnesses to the unit’s true history –\n\nresponded with approval. All,\n\nthat is, except Stone.\n\nIn 2001, “Platoon” was released\n\non DVD, drawing a new round of\n\npublicity. Many reviews praised\n\nthe ﬁ lm for its authenticity and\n\nrealism, echoing the old misconception that it was based on\n\nStone’s own experience in\n\nVietnam. That’s an indication,\n\nHemphill says, that the Vietnam\n\nstereotype lives on.\n\nHow, then, do veterans counter\n\nthe myth?\n\n“Dig up the old memories,”\n\nHemphill says. “Preserve the oral\n\nhistory of what happened in\n\nVietnam. Tell your story. Tell\n\nyour truth.” n\n\nSusan Katz Keating is author of\n\n“Prisoners of Hope: Exploiting\n\nthe POW/MIA Myth in America”\n\nand director of special programs\n\nfor the Freedom Museum in\n\nManassas, Va.\n\nJUST RELEASED!

At 35, she was the older woman in a world\n\nﬁlled with 19-year-olds. Her fragile, blonde good looks\n\nveiled a forceful, no-nonsense edge reminiscent of her\n\ninfamous 1930s namesake.

Others were simply made\n\ncomfortable with morphine until\n\nthey died.\n\n“These men were the most\n\nhorribly wounded casualties we\n\nhad in any war,” Barker said.\n\n“The dear souls would have died\n\non the battleﬁeld if it hadn’t been\n\nfor the helicopters. Some of them\n\nwe could save; some of them we\n\ncould not. But to provide them\n\nwith care was one heck of a job\n\nbecause these fellows might have\n\nall their extremities gone … part\n\nof their jaw, an eye, head injuries. It was so sad. Their prime\n\nconcern, as long as they could\n\ntalk, was their manhood. They\n\nalways put it in other terms, but\n\nwe would tell them exactly what\n\nthe situation was. I have to\n\nadmit, because of the tremendous\n\ninjuries and my own rusty\n\nclinical skills, I was scared stiff.”\n\nAlthough Barker’s background\n\nwas in ICU, she had been on\n\nrecruiting duty for three years\n\nand at school for two years prior\n\nto her assignment.\n\nPerhaps her tough “Ma”\n\npersona pulled her through the\n\nuncertain, hellish times. She\n\ndoesn’t know. What is clear is\n\nthat Barker didn’t just meet her\n\nfears; she excised them.

Then I’d get another one,” she\n\nsaid. “It was where I worked and\n\nall the infection I was exposed to.\n\n1965\n\nAmong 770 civil-rights\n\ndemonstrators arrested in\n\nSelma, Ala., is the Rev.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\nFollowing his release,\n\nhe leads a 50-mile\n\nfreedom march to protest\n\ndiscrimination.\n\nU.S. troop numbers in\n\nVietnam increase from\n\n20,000 to 190,000.\n\nA Soviet cosmonaut takes\n\nthe ﬁrst walk in space.\n\nRace riots in Watts,\n\nCalif., rage for ﬁve days.\n\nApproximately 20,000\n\nNational Guardsmen are\n\ncalled in to help\n\nrestore order.\n\nJames Michener’s “The\n\nSource” is the year’s\n\ntop-selling novel.\n\nThere was so much infection\n\nthere you wouldn’t believe it.\n\nSome of the guys would be\n\nwounded and be out in the ﬁeld a\n\nwhile before they got in. So by\n\nthe time we saw the wound, it\n\nwas really bad. My little infections were nothing compared to\n\nwhat we were taking care of.”\n\nA month after she returned to\n\nthe United States, an abscess on\n\n28\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\nher face became so septic Barker\n\nfell into a near-fatal coma.\n\nBruised Yet Unscathed. Despite\n\nthe perceptible scar on her cheek\n\nand the haunting recollections of\n\nthe war as a nonstop ritual of\n\ntriage, pre-op and intensive care,\n\nBarker came through the Vietnam\n\nexperience bruised but emotionally unscathed. She has no\n\nnightmares, no hate, no rancor.\n\n“I’m sure there were some\n\nwomen who were affected, but I\n\nwasn’t tremendously affected by\n\nthe war,” she said. “I’ll tell you\n\nthe reason. None of us over there\n\nwere required to do the same\n\nthing the men did. Yes, I was\n\nafraid of being taken prisoner. But\n\nwhen I was going to work at dusk\n\nto some nice, little air-conditioned\n\nhooch – and yes, with a lot of\n\nbadly wounded men – I’d see\n\nthese young Marines having a\n\ncigarette before they went out into\n\nthe jungle. The danger they\n\nencountered was horrendous.\n\nThat’s a hell of a lot different than\n\nme going to work. If I saw my\n\nfriend’s head blown off, I don’t\n\nthink I’d recover from that.”\n\nBefore Vietnam, Barker had\n\nconsidered herself fundamentally\n\nnarrow-minded. “I gradually\n\nbegan to realize I was a real\n\nbitch on wheels. I wanted\n\neverything done to perfection –\n\nthe way I wanted it – and I pretty\n\nmuch got it that way. But then I\n\ngot to Da Nang, and I realized\n\nthere was more to life than\n\nhaving a perfect career.”\n\nThat awakening made the\n\nadjustment back to her regular\n\nduties an exasperating time. She\n\nsaid she feels lucky other Vietnam veterans were at Chelsea\n\nNaval Hospital, Mass., in whom\n\nshe could conﬁde.\n\n“We had been in a day-by-day,\n\nlife-or-death situation,” Barker\n\nsaid. “And we would get so\n\nfrustrated when we got back to a\n\nhospital, and it became an\n\ninternational incident when you\n\nwere missing four sheets on your\n\nlinen count. It was those kind of\n\noccurrences that burned us up.”\n\nThose were minor irritations.\n\nFor someone like Barker, who\n\nhad wielded a considerable\n\namount of responsibility, the\n\ngreater difﬁculty was surrendering the authority the nurses had\n\nso rightfully earned in Vietnam\n\nto a batch of young, inexperienced stateside physicians.\n\n“We didn’t have many doctors\n\nin Vietnam so we did a lot of\n\nthings on our own, especially\n\nsomeone like me, who was the\n\nhead nurse in intensive care,”\n\nBarker said. “I was used to\n\ndepending on myself and taking\n\ncharge without consulting a\n\ndoctor. Not that I endangered\n\nany patient’s life, but I got\n\nmyself into a little bit of hot\n\nwater over that.”\n\nReliving the Experience. In\n\nApril 1975, “Ma” found herself\n\nreliving her Vietnam experience\n\nas director of nursing at Subic\n\nBay Naval Hospital in the Philippines during the evacuation of\n\nSaigon. The stoic sailor recognized the same people with\n\ndifferent maladies in a familiar,\n\npainful setting.\n\n“I didn’t work with families in\n\nVietnam, but I was accustomed to\n\nthe Vietnamese people,” she said.\n\n“Before being assigned to ICU, I\n\nran the prisoners ward. I found a\n\nVC doctor who’d been captured to\n\ncare for the patients, and I even\n\nhad Vietnamese corpsmen. I\n\nmade myself understood with\n\nsign language, whatever it took. I\n\nhave great respect for how they\n\ntook care of their own.”\n\nBarker belongs to a Navy nurse\n\nveterans group, attends reunions\n\nand keeps in touch with Vietnam\n\nveterans, yet she remains philosophical about her experience.\n\n“You can serve in the military for\n\na career and never be associated\n\nwith a war or a disaster. Then\n\nthere’s people like me who get\n\ninvolved in more than their share.\n\nWell, I joined the Navy to serve in\n\nthe best way I could. Over the\n\nyears, I hope I accomplished that.”\n\nIn 1979, Barker retired as the\n\nNavy’s director of nursing services after 22 years in uniform. n\n\nMargarette Chavez, a retired\n\nMarine chief warrant ofﬁcer-5, is\n\ncurrently editor of The Wilson\n\nCounty News in Floresville, Texas.\n\nTM\n\nWin a FREE\n\nThis Amazing New\n\nScooter PowerFolds\n\nto a Compact Size\n\nin Seconds!\n\nNo-Obligation\n\nand No Purchase\n\nNecessary!\n\nTM\n\nPowerFolding Scooter!\n\nAnd Now...Enter to Win Yours\n\nFREE in our Monthly Drawing!\n\nThe sleekly-styled AutoGo electric scooter\n\ndoes everything better...and much more!

Civic dissent results when conﬂicts drag on,\n\noffer no apparent resolution or clear purpose, and\n\nbecome especially bloody – the Athenian-Spartan\n\ndeadlock during the 27-year Peloponnesian War, for\n\ninstance, and the stalemate on the Western Front in\n\n1916 and 1917 that ruined a generation of European\n\nyouth. In this context, the American antiwar\n\nmovement’s role in opposing U.S. involvement in\n\nVietnam, was not at ﬁrst unusual.\n\nW\n\nThe complexity of America’s\n\ntask in Vietnam was daunting\n\nfrom the onset: repel communist\n\naggression, create and preserve\n\nthe foundations of consensual\n\ngovernment in South Vietnam,\n\nand somehow avoid drawing\n\neither communist China or the\n\nSoviet Union into the conﬂict.\n\nThe latter powers were formidable – equipped with nuclear\n\nmissiles, enjoying vast numerical\n\nsuperiority in the theater, and\n\nsupplying their clients with\n\nsophisticated weapons and\n\nhighly trained advisers.\n\nPractical difﬁculties were just\n\nas challenging. While relying on\n\na largely conscripted army\n\nduring the greatest period of\n\ndomestic racial, gender and class\n\nupheaval in some 50 years, the\n\nU.S. military was asked to wage a\n\nlimited war 7,000 miles away.\n\nFighting was to take place in\n\ncities and on difﬁcult terrain,\n\nagainst adversaries who were\n\n30\n\nThe American Legion Magazine\n\nSeptember 2003\n\noften indistinguishable from\n\ncivilians and sometimes showed\n\nallegiance to both sides. Our\n\nenemies, it should be noted,\n\ngalvanized support not on the\n\nslogans of their own adherence\n\nto communism and authoritarianism but disingenuously\n\nthrough calls for Western ideas\n\nof freedom and liberty.\n\nQuite unlike most great powers\n\nof the past, America had little\n\ninterest in appropriating foreign\n\nland or treasure. Indeed, our\n\nultimate – and often naïve –\n\ngoals were to foster consensual,\n\nAmerican-style government\n\nwhere it had not existed before,\n\nand thereby allow the Vietnamese to live free of communist\n\ntotalitarianism that had engulfed\n\nhundreds of millions on the\n\ncountry’s borders. Given both the\n\nstrategic constraints and limited\n\nobjectives, American soldiers\n\nwere not customarily asked to\n\ntake and hold ground, occupy\n\nenemy cities or invade the north,\n\nthe source of the aggression.\n\nInstead, our troops were there\n\nsimply to resist those who sought\n\nto impose their will on others.\n\nContainment, not conquest, was\n\nthe order of the day. At best, we\n\nenvisioned life support for\n\nsomething like a democratic and\n\ncapitalist Japan – at worst,\n\nanother independent though\n\nauthoritarian South Korea or\n\nTaiwan that in theory could\n\neventually evolve into a liberal\n\nsociety if protected against\n\ncommunist aggression.\n\nIf initially the United States\n\nreacted clumsily to such bafﬂing\n\nchallenges, it began by early 1968\n\nto achieve a series of important\n\nmilitary victories. After the failed\n\ncommunist Tet offensive of winter\n\n1968, America – for all practical\n\npurposes – destroyed the Viet\n\nCong network in the south for\n\nmore than a year. American\n\nmilitary forces also inﬂicted a\n\ncrushing military defeat on North\n\nVietnamese regulars when nearly\n\n50,000 of the enemy perished in\n\nthe bloody battles at Khe Sanh\n\nand Hue. Tens of thousands more\n\nwere wounded or missing. The\n\ncontroversial and occasionally\n\nmismanaged Phoenix program,\n\nwhich targeted enemy operatives\n\namong civilian cadres, nevertheless had disrupted and demoralized communist agents and\n\ninﬁltrators. A new, more accurate\n\nand sophisticated American\n\nbombing campaign that culminated in 1972 and 1973 – aimed at\n\nconventional communist invasion\n\nforces and strategic command\n\nand control in North Vietnam –\n\nYoung men burn their draft cards at an\n\nantiwar demonstration in front of the\n\nPentagon in October 1967. Corbis\n\nessentially ended large-scale\n\ncommunist aggression from the\n\nnorth altogether.\n\nInﬂuential Minority. Despite the\n\ncorruption of the struggling South\n\nVietnam government, American\n\nmilitary and economic aid –\n\ncoupled with land reform and\n\npolitical liberalization – had\n\npersuaded most South Vietnamese\n\nthey could sustain a viable anticommunist government. And so\n\nby 1973, an exasperated North\n\nVietnam was mostly ready for a\n\ncease-ﬁre. The war appeared to be\n\nover. The Vietnam quagmire had\n\nevolved into a Korean-like armistice, enforced by fear of American bombing should the communists renege on agreements.\n\nYet less than two years later,\n\nafter a series of treaty violations,\n\nthe north invaded the south and\n\nuniﬁed the country. A weary\n\nUnited States concluded it could\n\ndo no more in the aftermath of\n\nthe Nixon Watergate scandals. A\n\nsophisticated, mature antiwar\n\nmovement had, at last, convinced\n\nan inﬂuential minority of Ameri-\n\ncans that defeat was preferable to\n\ncontinued and costly resistance.\n\nThroughout the war, there was,\n\nof course, room for legitimate\n\ncriticism of such a difﬁcult and\n\ncontroversial mission, one that\n\nAmerican military and civilian\n\nplanners themselves had not\n\nfully grasped for years – perhaps\n\n"
