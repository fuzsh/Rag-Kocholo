And the world opens up in a way that is consistent with a certain point of view.”–Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth\n\nThe following listing is comprised of books, magazines, stories, articles, poetry, manuscripts and dramatizations that Robert E. Howard either may have possessed as part of his library, or that he mentions in his correspondence or stories. The list also includes writers he mentions, whether or not he names a work by them. The listing is intended to assist those who wish to study literary, historical and other influences that may have found their way into Howard’s work, and those who may wish to explore for themselves the world that opens up from the reading Robert Howard had done.\n\nThis project was originated by Vernon M. Clark and Steven R. Trout, who set out, initially, to acquire all the books listed as part of “Robert E. Howard’s Library” in The Dark Barbarian: The Writings of Robert E. Howard, A Critical Anthology (ed. Don Herron; Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984). Glenn Lord provided them with the names of other authors and books mentioned in Howard’s letters, and the project began to mushroom. I joined in somewhat later, at first a bit hesitantly, later with real enthusiasm. Vern, Steve and I have each spent, probably, hundreds of hours in used book stores, and added hundreds of titles to our own libraries. I have pored over and over all of Howard’s letters (at least all that I am aware of!); I have gone into all his stories, for verse headings, quotations, allusions; I have been through the memoirs of his friends and associates, Tevis Clyde Smith, Novalyne Price Ellis, Harold Preece, and E. Hoffmann Price, to find mentions of writers and works he discussed with them; all in order to make this as encyclopedic a listing of Howard’s reading interests as it is possible to recreate. I have logged uncounted hours in the Library of Congress (one of the real perks of living in the Washington area!) and other libraries tracking down information about obscure authors and titles. I have also been assisted immeasurably by my friend Larry Richter, who introduced me to the wonders of Internet book searches (such as the excellent used-book search services, Bibliofind and Advanced Book Exchange), and keeps sending bibliographic information my way.\n\nAs much work as we have done, however, our task was made immeasurably easier by the pioneering efforts of Mrs. Corrine Shields, Dr. Charlotte Laughlin, Glenn Lord, and Steve Eng.\n\nIn the first issue of Paperback Quarterly, “A Journal For Paperback Collectors” (The Pecan Valley Press [Billy C. Lee], Brownwood, TX, Spring 1978), Dr. Laughlin recounted the events leading up to her publication, beginning with that issue, of “Robert E. Howard’s Library: An Annotated Checklist.” After first relating Dr. Isaac Howard’s donation of his son’s library, consisting of “some 300 books, the great majority of which deal [sic] history and biography” (Brownwood Bulletin, 29 June 1936), to Howard Payne College (now University) in Brownwood as the foundation of a Memorial Collection, she writes:\n\nAfter the first few years, the Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection was forgotten at Howard Payne; and the books were gradually placed on the open shelves for general circulation. It was not until the recent revival of the popularity of Howard’s fiction that interest was again shown in separating the Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection from the rest of the Howard Payne Library. With the intervention of forty years much has been lost, but what we have been able to reestablish is the result of the work of an enterprising reference librarian.\n\nWhen John Bloom, a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald, asked the librarian, Mrs. Corrine Shields, for help in researching an article on Robert E. Howard, she began trying to locate the remnants of his collection. She first checked the shelf lists; but she found that these did not begin until 1948, when the library had stopped keeping accession lists. She then located the old accession lists in a dusty library closet; but since the entries were not dated or alphabetical, she could not determine which books were in the Howard collection. Working from the information in the June 29, 1936, Brownwood Bulletin, she knew that a large part of the collection was history and biography. Mrs. Shields went to the section of the library where biographies are shelved and began to pull books off the shelves to look for the bookplate of ‘The Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection.’ After several failures, she hit the jackpot with The Saga of Billy the Kid by Walter Noble Burns. On the front pastedown endpaper, was the bookplate and stamped inside the book was the accession number. Armed with this number, she went back to the dusty accession records and found the book listed. She checked the preceding and following books in the accession records and established a list of 268 books which were probably in the original Howard collection. Checking first the card catalog and then the books themselves, Mrs. Shields found that many of the books are no longer in the library and that some which are in the library do not have the bookplate and therefore may be copies obtained from another source.\n\nOf the 268 books believed to have composed the Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection, 45 remain with the bookplate in place. All of these have remnants of a blue slip of paper which was pasted on the back free endpaper. This slip, which is intact in The Saga of Billy the Kid, reads ‘THIS BOOK IS FOR USE IN THE LIBRARY.’ This evidence indicates that the books were placed originally in a special collection for library use only, as Dr. Howard had wished.\n\nBefore Laughlin had finished publication of her article (which ran in four issues), three more books had been located with the bookplate. Later, L. Sprague and Catherine Crook de Camp located a few others, during the course of their research.\n\nAnother transcription of the accession listing was made by Glenn Lord, then the agent for the heirs to Robert E. Howard’s work, and still the foremost authority on Howard, and circulated with the twelfth mailing (July 1978) of The Hyperborean League, an amateur press association dedicated to Howard and to Clark Ashton Smith. Lord’s listing differed from Laughlin’s in a few details; the original lists were handwritten in an accession ledger, and contained numerous errors, such as garbled titles, mistranscribed names (in one instance at least, an illustrator was credited as the author of the book), and other indications of haste and carelessness — to say nothing of simply illegible handwriting. Lord and Laughlin differed in some of their readings.\n\nSteve Eng took Laughlin’s and Lord’s lists and prepared a revised and significantly improved listing of “Robert E. Howard’s Library” for The Dark Barbarian. Steve did yeoman work in libraries to track down information on the authors and titles, and the result must still be considered the standard listing of Howard’s library. While the present list corrects some errors in Eng’s (most carried over from the earlier ones), and fills in gaps, this listing is not confined to Howard’s library alone. For that matter, this listing includes authors whom Howard says he’s never read (such as Joseph Conrad)!\n\nWhile the vast majority of the books originally donated to Howard Payne College by Dr. Howard were presumably owned or read by Robert, some may have belonged to his mother or father, to friends who had loaned them to him, etc. It appears, also, that the cataloging of the Howard collection was often interrupted in order to note other acquisitions: it is hard to imagine, for example, that Robert E. Howard owned two copies of a book titled Curriculum Making in the Elementary School! Eng dropped a number of such titles that had appeared in Laughlin’s listing. I have chosen to list them in Appendix Four. While books on pedagogical methods seem unlikely to have interested Howard, it is quite possible that some of the works on nature, such as guides to trees or birds, would be part of an author’s research library. And I, personally, wonder whether some of the books on religious subjects which were retained in Eng’s listing were indeed Howard’s: Howard Payne is a Baptist school.\n\nBut with a writer whose interests were as wide-ranging as Howard’s, and whose friends attested to his ability to pull a book from the shelf of a library or bookstore and in minutes have read it, with excellent recall, there can never be a “final word” as to what he did or did not read. It is my hope, however, that this listing will at least provide a solid foundation for such speculations, rather than the flimsy suppositions, based on superficial similarities in incident or plot, that have too often passed for “evidence” of “influence” on Howard’s work.\n\nI can also personally vouch for another benefit to be gotten from this listing: I have made the acquaintance of a number of writers who would have otherwise remained unknown to me. If this project had introduced me only to Donn Byrne, once a popular writer of Irish romances, now seemingly forgotten, it would have been worth it: Howard doesn’t seem to have cared much for Byrne (finding his work “tainted” by his “Orange leanings”), but I have now acquired an almost complete collection of his works. My own library — and my own life — have been immeasurably enriched by the acquisition of many of the titles listed here. It is my hope that others will benefit similarly.\n\nI can say with confidence that no man, however mature, ever loved reading for its own sake more than I. I did not read because of any particular urge for learning, or to merely pass the time, or to escape the realities of life. I read simply because I loved reading for its own sake alone. The printed page was like wine to me. — Robert E. Howard\n\n[Main Menu]\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTES\n\nAt the time Robert E. Howard’s library was donated to Howard Payne College, the library recorded new accessions in an accounting ledger. The ledger in which the Howard collection was listed appears to have been previously used for accounting purposes — a few pages have what appear to be expenses posted on the first few lines (one is dated October 1924, and the others are in the same hand). At least two, and possibly three, different hands appear to have been involved in the listing of the Howard books. In the right-hand column is stamped an accession number for each book. For all those books which were listed in the Howard Payne accessions ledger, I have recorded this number following the publication information. The number is followed by initials indicating the previous listings of Robert E. Howard’s library in which the title appeared:\n\n“PQ1,” “PQ2,” “PQ3,” and “PQ4” are references to the first through fourth issues, respectively, of Paperback Quarterly, “A Journal For Paperback Collectors” (The Pecan Valley Press [Billy C. Lee], Brownwood, TX) in which Dr. Laughlin’s “Robert E. Howard’s Library: An Annotated Checklist” first appeared.\n\n“GL” refers to Glenn Lord’s listing in The Hyperborean League, Mailing Twelve (July 1978).\n\n“TDB” refers to Steve Eng’s “Robert E. Howard’s Library,” in The Dark Barbarian: The Writings of Robert E. Howard, A Critical Anthology (ed. Don Herron; Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984).\n\n“Still in HPU holdings” indicates items from the Robert E. Howard Memorial Collection that are still in the special collection at Howard Payne University Library. The information on these editions is taken directly from the books in that collection.\n\nFor those books that are no longer in the Howard Payne library, we cannot know what edition Howard owned: the accessions listing made no note of editions, dates, etc. This is also, of course, true of the works which Howard mentioned in letters or stories but which were not a part of his actual library. I have generally recorded the date of the first edition, when known, with preference given to the first American edition when that information was available. For a number of the books which I have myself acquired, where I am reasonably certain there were not other contemporary editions, I have recorded the information directly from my copy. During Howard’s lifetime, however, it was a common practice to issue inexpensive reprints of popular books much sooner after first publication than is the practice in publishing today. In particular, Grosset & Dunlap and A.L. Burt & Co. were publishers of popular reprint fiction, and it seems likely that Howard would have bought these editions, when available. Howard was also a fan of Emmanuel Haldeman-Julius’ Little Blue Books, a series of 3½” by 5″ paperbound reprints of classic fiction, as well as many non-fiction works, from philosophy to self-improvement. He may have read a number of the works listed herein in those editions.\n\nWhen Howard mentioned an author or work in his correspondence, this is indicated by reference to the correspondent and date (when known) of the letter, as in “REH to E. Hoffmann Price, 15 February 1936.” If the story or author was mentioned in a Howard story, poem, essay, or other work, the title is given. I have chosen to quote matter from the letters directly from photocopies of Howard’s typescripts, when available, rather than from later published sources, preserving all typographical errors, misspellings, punctuation, etc. When I do not have a copy of the actual typescript, I have used Glenn Lord’s transcripts of these; only as a last resort have I used published versions.\n\n“SL 1” refers to Robert E. Howard: Selected Letters 1923-1930, edited by Glenn Lord (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press, 1989). “SL 2” refers to Robert E. Howard: Selected Letters 1931-1936, edited by Glenn Lord (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press, 1991). The number following the “SL” designation refers to the number assigned to that letter in those volumes.\n\nHoward’s friend Tevis Clyde Smith wrote several brief memoirs of REH, in some of which were mentioned books and authors, including “Report on a Writing Man,” “Adventurer in Pulp,” “Conversation on the Bridge,” and “So Far the Poet…” (the last being notes for a planned biography of Howard). All of these were collected in Report on a Writing Man and Other Reminiscences of Robert E. Howard (West Warwick, RI: Necronomicon Press, 1991).\n\nOne Who Walked Alone is a memoir by Novalyne Price Ellis (West Kingston, RI: Donald M. Grant, 1986) of her relationship with REH during the final two years of his life, 1934-1936. This memoir was based on journals Mrs. Ellis (then Miss Price) was keeping at the time.\n\n“The Eyrie” was the letters column of Weird Tales. Howard wrote several letters in praise of authors and stories in the magazine.\n\nOf incalculable reference assistance were:\n\nAshley, Mike. Who’s Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction.

May-June, 1933 [SL 2 #67]: “Magazines were even more scarce than books. It was after I moved into ‘town’ (speaking comparatively) that I began to buy magazines. I well remember the first I ever bought. I was fifteen years old. I bought it one summer night when a wild restlessness in me would not let me keep still, and I had exhausted all the reading material on the place. I’ll never forget the thrill it gave me. Somehow it had never occurred to me before that I could buy a magazine. It was an Adventure. I still have the copy. After that I bought Adventure for many years, though at times it cramped my resources to pay the price. It came out three times a month, then….I skimped and saved from one magazine to the next; I’d buy one copy and have it charged, and when the next issue was out, I’d pay for the one for which I owed, and have the other one charged, and so on.”\n\nREH to Carl Jacobi, ca. June 1934: “Yes, I noticed the Popular company had bought Adventure, and as you probably have read, they’ve changed editors again. Corcoran sold a serial to Cosmopolitan and threw up the job to free-lance — probably proving Jack London’s assertion that most editors wanted to be writers, secretly or otherwise.” [Howard submitted a number of stories to Adventure, but none were accepted.

Howard’s “Am-ra” fragments are brief, but even so share some common elements with Anderson’s series: the hero is both a warrior and an artist, he is exiled due to a clash with the tribe’s priests, he fights against a race of black men, the Ta-an are referred to as “the people of the caves,” etc. Such similarities seem unlikely to be coincidental. Anderson’s Ta-an series consisted of “The Son of the Red God” (Argosy, 31 January 1920), “The Lord of the Winged Death” (Argosy, 6 March 1920), “The Cave That Swims on the Water” (Argosy, 8 May 1920), “The Master of Magic” (Argosy, 17 July 1920), “The Wings of the Snow” (Argosy, 28 August 1920), and “Up From the Abyss” (Argosy, 22 March 1924).

Norton & Co., 1928), wrote: “Nevertheless detailed study shows that the form and size of the body are not entirely shaped by heredity. Records of the stature of European men that date back to the middle of the past century show that in almost all countries the average statures have increased by more than an inch. It is true, this is not a satisfactory proof of an actual change, because improvement in public health has changed the composition of the populations, and although it is not likely that this should be the cause of an increase in stature, it is conceivable. A better proof is found in the change of stature among descendants of Europeans who settle in America. In this case it has been shown that in many nationalities the children are taller than their own parents, presumably on account of more favorable conditions of life.” (p. 33) A note on p. 238-239 states, “Comparisons of parents and their own children are given in F. Boas, Changes in Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants, pp. 28, 30.” Clark Wissler, in Man and Culture (q.v.), cites Boas on p. 317: “It came about that some years ago a distinguished anthropologist hit upon the idea of rounding up in America the descendants of the foreign born and comparing them with their parents. The result was rather startling, for in matters of head form there were clear-cut differences between the parents who grew up in Europe and their children who were born here. For example, the longer-headed parents of European growth, produced children in America who grew up with shorter heads, greater stature, etc.” His notes cite Boas, Franz, Changes in Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants (The Immigration Commission, Senate Document No. 208, Washington, 1910).\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nBoccaccio, Giovanni\n\n(1313?-1375).\n\nREH to Tevis Clyde Smith, 25 February 1925: “I’ve read Boccaccio…and a lot of those old libertines…” In “Children of the Night,” Conrad’s library is said to include “the Mandrake Press edition of Boccaccio.” The Mandrake Press published two works of Boccaccio: (1) Amorous Fiammetta. “Reprinted from the original English edition, translation of Bartholomew Young (1587); now edited with an introduction by K.H.

Why, the O’Neills — God knows they’re as true and fine a pure Irish family as ever lived but he made the hero half Norman and why did he pick the O’Neills? Because they’re Ulster stock; maybe the reason why a just God hasn’t blasted Ulster long ago. And he can’t even give the O’Donnells of Donegal justice. Aborigine, he calls them and all other native Irish families. Oh well — you said he’s half d’Arcy, didn’t you? I’ve gotten so I’m suspicious of all Celtic seemings. I expect to find a Fitzpaul or a Fitzgerald lurking under every straightforward Costovan and O’Brien.” [Donn-Byrne’s mother was Jane D’Arcy McParland.

Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1928.\n\nREH to Harold Preece, ca. September 1929: “I’ve been reading Destiny Bay and in a way the book’s left a bad taste in my mouth. I remember several years ago, picking up the magazine with one of those stories in it. I read it avidly for awhile, until — I remember what a distinct shock it was when I suddenly discovered that the characters were a bunch of damned Orangemen. I was not only shocked but astounded. In those days, I in my innocence supposed that the only Irish who ever found their way into decent literature were South-country people. I supposed that, naturally, all Irish writers and men of intellect came from the South — and that the Ulstermen, realizing their low moral and psychic status, make it a point to conceal their shame as much as possible. Such the innocence of youth. Yet here was an Orangeman flouting his shame, and his people’s shame, in my very face — blatantly and brazenly announcing his color, and apparently proud of it. I have received many literary shocks. Few have equalled this. I felt vaguely outraged and insulted. I finally took up the reptilian thing and tried to read it, but the zest had gone out of it. Bred in the traditions of Munster and Connaught, or at least a handed down remnant of those traditions, a violent hatred of all things Orange was as natural to me, and as much a part of me, as patriotism and love for the striped flag is to the average American youth, reared with Boy Scout standards. ¶ Well, I know more now and I’m broader-minded. I’m no more like an old Irish acquaintance of mine from Leinster who used to almost have apoplexy at the very slightest mention, even, of Belfast. But still I can’t stomach that Orange tint with which the late Byrne besmeared all his works — well, maybe not all. He professed a fine national Irish flavor. And he was a liar when he did.” REH to Harold Preece, postmarked 18 September 1929: “I’ve been reading Destiny Bay. There’s a book for you! Take it by and large, I believe I like Hangman’s House better, but Destiny Bay is fine in spite of its Orange leanings.

I passed up the job because de Castro wouldn’t meet my price. At that period Long had a temporary affectation of leaving off his first name.”] REH to H.P.

The reason for its echoes in Dr. de Castro’s work is that the latter gentleman is a revision-client of mine – into whose tales I have stuck these glancing references for sheer fun.”\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nDefoe, Daniel\n\n(1660-1731).\n\nREH to Tevis Clyde Smith, 7 July 1923, in a listing of parodic book titles is “‘Snobinson Do-So,’ by Daniel DeFoe.” [Robinson Crusoe, 1719]\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nde Gourmont, Rémy\n\n(1858-1915)\n\n“Orange.”\n\nREH to Tevis Clyde Smith, 25 February 1925: “I’ve read Boccaccio, Dumas, Hugo, and a lot of those old libertines, but for polished obscenity, Remy de Gourmont takes the cake. I’ll quote a few lines, direct from one of his stories: ‘The captain’s hand slipped from her shoulder to her breast, while the other supported her yielding waist. It is an eminently classical pose, the sequel of which is, not far from a bed of verdure, the difficulty of lifting a skirt caught under a recumbent body. Sometimes the tender victim, her sense of folds not entirely lost in the ecstasy of her senses, comes to the lover’s aid.’ And so on.” The quotation is from “Orange,” originally published in Couleurs, contes nouveaux suivis de choses anciennes (1908). This story is included in Little Blue Book #541, Stories in Green, Zinzolin, Rose, Purple, Mauve, Lilac and Orange: Howard’s quotation does not match it quite word-for-word, but he may have quoted from memory. I have found no other English translation of “Orange” prior to 1929.\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nDe Halve Maen\n\n[Publication of The Holland Society.]\n\nREH to Wilfred B. Talman, ca. July 1932: “Thanks very much for De Halve Maen. I found it very interesting indeed, particularly the list of words of Dutch origin. Noting that the Holland society is made up of people whose ancestors came to America before 1675 makes me feel almost like a recent immigrant.” REH to H.P. Lovecraft, ca. November 1933: “Thanks for the loan of De Halve Maen. Talman used to mail me a copy, but I didn’t get it this time. I read the article you mentioned with much interest…” [See Lovecraft, “Some Dutch Footprints in New England.”]\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nde la Mare, Walter\n\n(1873-1956)\n\nREH to H.P. Lovecraft, ca.

Lovecraft, ca. November 1932 [SL 2 #65]: “De Maupassant has power – undoubted power. Too much power for me to read extensively. Talk about Nordic gloom – his tales of French peasant life are enough to make a man want to cut his own throat. After reading some of his more realistic yarns, I’ve been unable to see any good in anything, except thankfulness for the fact that I wasn’t a Frenchman.” De Maupassant is mentioned in Howard’s poem, “A Poet’s Skull” (as “de Maupason”).\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nDe Quincey, Thomas\n\n(1785-1859).\n\nREH to Tevis Clyde Smith, ca. December 1928 [SL 1 #19]: “I’ve been reading the old masters for the past days and find that I get more solid enjoyment out of them than the moderns. That age was more robust than ours, and they thought deeper, if more heavily – De Quincey at least, was certainly the forerunner of the school to which Poe contributed and I at present honor with my presence – literarily speaking – I mean the school of fantasy and horror writing.”\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\nDerleth, August William\n\n(1909-1971).\n\nREH began corresponding with Derleth at the end of 1932 and continued to do so until his death. REH to Tevis Clyde Smith, ca. September 1930 [SL 1 #44]: “I got a letter from Lovecraft and he referred to August Derleth; you know, the fellow that writes the very short stories that appear regularly in Weird Tales. I was amazed to learn that Derleth is only twenty-one years old. He must have started writing when he was about ten.” REH to H.P. Lovecraft, ca. September 1930 [SL 1 #43]: “I was amazed to learn that August W. Derleth is only twenty-one. He must have begun marketing his work at a very early age, for it seems that I have been reading his stories in Weird Tales for years. My friends and I have often commented on the excellence of his products and wondered why he did not try his hand at longer stories.” REH to H.P. Lovecraft, ca. September 1932: “Good for Derleth! Which of his stories got the citations? I’ve known for years that was of ‘the right girt’, as John A. Murrell used to say. He’s deserved much more notice from Weird Tales readers than he’s gotten — doubtless because of the shortness of his stories; the readers seem to like ’em long, generally. More power to him; I wish him all the luck in the world.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. 15 December 1932: “I have followed your work in Weird Tales for several years, with great interest, and have more than once expressed my admiration for your stories both to Lovecraft and to the editors of the magazine.”\n\n“Afternoon in June.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 4 July 1935 [SL 2 #75]: “Thanks very much for the article, ‘Afternoon in June’. I got a big kick out of it.”\n\n“An Elegy for Mr. Danielson.” Weird Tales, August 1933.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. August 1933: “I got a kick out of your story in the current Weird Tales. The idea of the Druidic stones and that chant for raising corpses carried real power and seemed to partly raise a dim curtain on monstrous twilight vistas.”\n\n“Birkett’s Twelfth Corpse.” The Fantasy Fan, December 1933.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. December 1933: “I read with much interest your recent story in Fantasy Fan. I remember you mentioning this yarn to me, when you first wrote it, saying it had been suggested by a drowning in the Wisconsin River. It was a damned good story.”\n\n“A Cloak from Messer Lando.” Weird Tales, September 1934.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. October 1934: “I liked your ‘Cloak From Messer Lando’. You handle this type of story remarkably well.”\n\nEvening in Spring. Ms. [New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1941]\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. November 1933: “I am reading your splendid ‘Evening in Spring’ sent me by your friend in Arizona. It is not a work to be read sketchily, and I am reading it slowly and with the deepest appreciation. Thanks for the opportunity of seeing it.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. December 1933: “Yes, I’m enjoying ‘Evening in Spring’ very much indeed. I must finish it before I’ll feel capable of expressing my exact reactions, but all I’ve read so far has impressed me with your keen insight into human nature, and what is of equal value to me, your broad understanding of humanity, which is the only basis for intelligent tolerance.”\n\n“Five Alone.” Pagany, July-September 1932.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 23 March 1933: “By the way, in what publication was the story, ‘Five Alone’ published? I’d like very much to read it.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. May 1933: “I sure would like to read ‘Five Alone’ if you can lend me a copy of it.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. July 1933: “Thanks immensely for the opportunity of reading ‘Five Alone’. It is magnificent; real power, there. I was gripped by it. It really got under my hide as few stories can do. The living members of that strange family, clinging to their morbid obsession, conversing with departed kin – say, did you draw them from real life? Anyway, you managed to invest them with a startling reality…. I’m sure glad to hear that ‘Five Alone’ is to be published in the anthology you mentioned; it certainly deserves it.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. August 1933: “Yes, I certainly did enjoy ‘Five Alone’ and am not at all surprized that it received recognition from O’Brien and others.” [See also Derleth, Place of Hawks]\n\n“Hawk on the Blue.” Ms. [London Daily Express, 4 October 1934].\n\nThis story is based on an incident related to Derleth by Howard in a letter ca. October 1933. In his next letter (also October 1933), Howard says, “By all means use the hawk incident if you wish… Far from having any objections, I’d feel sincerely honored. I wish you the best of luck with it.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. November 1933: “I enjoyed reading your ‘Hawk on the Blue’ very much indeed. That’s the difference between a real writer and an ordinary one. It never occurred to me that the incident held any particular literary possibilities, yet you have woven it into as fine a story of its kind as I ever read.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. December 1933: “I think Scribner’s was nuts to turn down ‘Hawk on the Blue.'”\n\n“Hawks Down the Wind.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 28 November 1935: “Thanks for the opportunity of reading of ‘Hawks Down the Wind’ and ‘Woodcock in the Marshes’. I admired very much the vividness of their style, and I heartily agree with their sentiments.”\n\nThe Heritage of Sauk City. Preface (and alterations) by E.K. Hayes. Sauk City, WI: The Pioneer Press, 1931.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. February 1933: “…thank you again for the book. I found it most fascinating, and am rather sorry you decided to publish it anonymously; surely so rich and accurate a work should bear the name of its creator. ¶ It is easy to see that you have done a vast amount of research in gathering your data, and you are to be complimented on your energy, as well as on your ability in presenting this data.¶ Again, let me thank you for the history of Sauk City….”\n\n“January Thaw.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. January/February 1935: “First of all let me express belated thanks for the article ‘January Thaw’ which I read with much interest and appreciation.”\n\n“July Night.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 1 November 1935: “I should have written you months ago to thank you for the opportunity of reading ‘July Night’, one of the finest bits of literature I’ve seen in many a day.”\n\n“Lesandro’s Familiar.” Weird Tales, May 1936.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 9 May 1936: “I enjoyed your ‘Lesandro’s Familiar’ a lot. It was the best yarn in an issue not otherwise remarkable.”\n\n“The Metronome.” Weird Tales, February 1935.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. January/February 1935: “I got a big kick out of ‘The Metronome’; one of the best weird shorts I ever read.”\n\n“Mr. Berbeck Had A Dream.” Weird Tales, November 1935.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 1 November 1935: “I enjoyed your story in the current Weird Tales – clever, and very well written, as of course all your yarns are. It was somewhat different from most of your stories, but just as interesting.”\n\n“Nellie Foster.” Weird Tales, June 1933.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 3 July 1933: “I hardly have to say that I liked your latest story, because I’ve never encountered a story of yours that I didn’t like.” (Mention of Derleth’s comments on “Black Colossus” make it likely it is the story in the June 1933 issue to which he refers.)\n\n“Nine Strands in a Web.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. August 1933: “I look forward to reading… ‘Nine Strands in a Web’.” [See also Derleth, Place of Hawks]\n\n“The No-Sayers.” [Brooklyn Eagle Magazine of Features, 21 April 1935].\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. December 1933: “I think Scribner’s was nuts to turn down ‘Hawk on the Blue.’ Hope you’ve hit them in the belly with ‘The No-Sayers’.”\n\n“One Against the Dead.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. October 1933: “Thanks very much for the opportunity of reading ‘One Against the Dead’, which I enjoyed greatly. Like most of your work it has an intense feeling of reality – as if it must have happened. I don’t see why any high class magazine should reject it. I especially like the suggestion of eeriness running through the story, not over-emphasized, but none the less powerful. Or at least so it seems to me.”\n\n“Panelled Room.” Westminster Magazine, 1933.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. October 1933: “And I intend to read your ‘Panelled Room’ if I can find the magazine mentioned.”\n\n“Phantom Lights.” The Fantasy Fan, May 1934.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 30 May 1934: “I enjoyed your story in Fantasy Fan…”\n\nPlace of Hawks. New York: Loring & Mussey, 1935.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. May 1933: “I hope you’ve had good luck with ‘Place of Hawks’ and the other stories.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. August 1933: “I look forward to reading ‘Place of Hawks’…” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. September 1933: “Hope you placed the ‘Place of Hawks’ with Scribner’s.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. March/April 1934: “I look forward to seeing ‘Place of Hawks’ in book form…” [The volume contains “Five Alone,” “Faraway House,” “Nine Strands in a Web,” and the title story.]\n\n“Retreat to Nature.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 9 May 1936: “Thanks very much for ‘Retreat to Nature.’ You’ve put into words, vividly and powerfully, what I’ve tried to say in my stumbling way several times – to derision of various would-be sophisticates. I’m going to keep your article handy and brandish it in their faces next time instead of busting them over the head with a branding iron as I contemplated.”\n\n“Tendency.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. October 1933: “The announcement of ‘Tendency’ looks good.”\n\n“Those Who Seek.” Weird Tales, January 1932.\n\nREH to The Eyrie, March 1932: “If I were to express a preference for any one of the tales, I believe I should name Derleth’s Those Who Seek…”\n\nUnnamed poems.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. July 1933: “Thanks too for the poem; it is a fine piece of work. I’d like to see more of your poetry.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. August 1933: “Thanks immensely for the poems. You can certainly conceive magnificent titles, and the poems match the titles. I like your verse fully as well as your prose, and that, God knows, is no depreciation of your prose. There is depth and power in your poetry, a strong tranquill flowing as of a deep river. I am not merely weaving complimentary images politely; this is my honest emotion.” REH to August W. Derleth, 4 September 1933: “I found your poems, as always, delightful. I don’t know which I like best. Each has poignant charm of its own, and all its own. Your poetry clings close to the very roots of Life.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. October 1933: “I also liked your poem, and sympathize with your feeling in regard to hawks.” REH to August W. Derleth, ca. December 1933: “I enjoyed your poem greatly. I do not pretend to understand all its imagery…But I have read it again and again, fascinated by its melody and depth and power.”\n\nUnnamed story.\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, ca. October 1933: “I note with interest Scribner’s criticism of your story, saying that the atmosphere was too much superior to the story. That is a peculiar criticism. As far as I’m concerned, atmosphere and story are both splendid.” REH to August W. Derleth, 11 December 1934: “I liked your story in the Not at Night Anthology.”\n\n“Woodcock in the Marshes.”\n\nREH to August W. Derleth, 28 November 1935: “Thanks for the opportunity of reading of ‘Hawks Down the Wind’ and ‘Woodcock in the Marshes’.

Derleth, 11 December 1934: “I enjoyed your yarn in the latest Weird Tales. You have collaborated with Schorer on quite a number of stories, have you not? I do not seem to remember ever having seen his name except in collaboration with you, though doubtless he has written numbers of stories.”\n\nDerleth, August, and Mark Schorer. “The Return of Andrew Bentley.” Weird Tales, September 1933.\n\nREH to August W.

November 1932 [SL 2 #65]: “I wouldn’t take anything, though, for my early readings of Scott, Dickens, and other English writers. I doubt if I could read Dickens now – with the exception of Pickwick Papers which is my favorite of all his books. He gets on my nerves, not so much by his tedium, as by the spineless cringing crawling characters he portrays. I don’t doubt he was drawing them true to life, but that realization makes the matter more damnable. Nicholas Nickleby was about the only one of his characters who had any guts at all. Why good gad, his characters submitted to indignities and insults and outrages that made me grind my teeth merely to read about.
