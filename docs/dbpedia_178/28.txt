When Denton was established in 1857 as the county seat of the 900 square mile Denton County, the courthouse square was a favorite hunting ground for wild turkey and prairie chickens. Named for pioneer preacher, lawyer and soldier, John Bunyan Denton, whose remains are buried on the courthouse lawn, the North Texas area was the home of cattle baron John Chisum and the outlaw, Sam Bass.

Today, Denton smoothly combines the past with progressive modern development. From the historic Courthouse-on-the-Square to the elegant turn-of-the-century homes on “Silk Stocking Row”, there is abundant history for even the most enthusiastic history buff.
