        "text": "Odeya Rush and Brenton Thwaites in The Giver\n\nBrenton and Odeya made a stop in my hometown of sunny Miami, and I was lucky enough to chat with them about their new movie, The Giver. They also talked about their craft, auditioning, interactions and gifts from fans, and even movies they can’t wait to see. Check it out after the jump!\n\nQ: Amongst all the young adult releases, what stands out to you about The Giver?\n\nBrenton: What stands out to me is that the hero is armed with a series of memories. He’s given this skill of knowledge. That is the power that leads him to make good choices.\n\nOdeya: It’s very detailed and it’s not something that’s just for teenagers. It’s a message that a lot of adults will take away. The topics that we bring up are really mature, you know?\n\nQ: Did you guys do anything off set to enhance the chemistry on screen?\n\nBrenton: No. We just talked and had fun.\n\nOdeya: Jeff likes to play music and likes to play guitar. I like to sing, so I think that’s how we enjoyed ourselves when we weren’t acting.\n\nQ: From watching actors like Meryl and Jeff, is there anything that you picked up on?\n\nBrenton: It’s great to watch them act and prepare. They are very confident and secure, but at the same time very open and positive. That combination is hard to create.\n\nQ: Is there anything you’ve received from fans that you love? Or do you recall fan interactions that stood out to you?\n\nBrenton: Someone gave me some guitar picks at Sundance before this movie came out. One said my name and the other said my favorite song. It was the sweetest gift.\n\nOdeya: I think it’s just seeing girls my age saying, “I’m so excited for you and that you have the opportunity to do this, and it makes me believe that I can do it too.” I think it’s great that I can be that for someone because growing up in Israel I didn’t really have someone like that. The fact that a lot of girls are telling me “I also want to do what you’re doing” is really special.\n\nQ: As young actors, as far as auditioning, is it still a painful process? I know it’s very competitive. Is it just another try-out or is it still daunting?\n\nOdeya: It’s just hard because you can’t control who you are. There’s essence about people. You really get said ‘no’ to so many more times than you get said ‘yes’ to. It’s hard because growing up you already have so many insecurities and to have people pick at you and say, “She doesn’t have a quirk,” or, “She’s not cosmopolitan.” Someone in this movie thought I wasn’t cosmopolitan enough for a while. And I was like, “I don’t know how to control that.”\n\nQ: So did you fight for this part?\n\nOdeya: Yes, I had to because there were so many people that I had to convince. Phil (the director) and Jeff were really on my side and I’m so thankful for that. Every time I thought I had the part I would hear, “We want to see girls from London or we’re seeing girls who are older.” I’ve been told “no” to a lot especially when I first moved out to LA. For six months there was nothing. I auditioned for really bad parts (laughs) but I just wanted to work and have that experience. I feel like maybe this project picked me, maybe sometimes I’m not right for certain things. And the fact that I was right for a movie like this and I am so proud to be in–I’m so thankful.\n\nBrenton: Phil fought for me as well. He believed in us even when we didn’t believe in ourselves. I mean, I know I didn’t. You just kind of do it because you love it, not because you believe you’re going to be in this huge movie.\n\nQ: Do you guys have any dream roles or people you want to work with?\n\nOdeya: It’s weird sometimes to work with a director and you feel like maybe this isn’t right, but you have to realize this is their creation and you’re a small part of it. I want to work with Clint Eastwood, Sofia Coppola and Tarantino. I want to work with more female directors and direct as well. I want to change it up because I feel like every movie is a different experience because of the director. You’re always going to have to change your style of acting.\n\nQ: Do you guys have formal training? Are you a “method” actor, or do you approach every movie differently?\n\nBrenton: It’s different with each movie, but my process is the same. I studied a style that derives from Lee Strasberg. But at the end of the day, you throw it all away and try to be real in the moment.\n\nOdeya: I did go to an acting class in New York and our teacher always told us to be real. We’re not “acting” this part, we’re living it and to always come from truth. I feel like my style of acting always evolves. It depends on who I am working with and who the character is. For me, it’s trying to be as comfortable as I am and then, like Brenton said, take it all away (laughs) when you get to set.\n\nQ: Is there any upcoming films that you can’t wait to see? Maybe another book that’s being turned into a movie or something else all together?\n\nBrenton: I can’t wait to see Boyhood.\n\nOdeya: Gone Girl.\n\nBrenton: Did you read the book?\n\nOdeya: No (laughs).\n\nRead part 1 of an interview with Brenton, Odeya and author Lois Lowry here.\n\nAnd make sure to check out our review of the movie here.\n\nThe Giver is out NOW!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelissa Berne\n\nShe is twenty-something and was born in Miami, raised in Haiti until she was 8, then came back to Miami.
