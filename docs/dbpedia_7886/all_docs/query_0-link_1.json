The film stars Hunt, Luke Wilson, Brenton Thwaites and Leonor Varela.[1] A mother travels cross-country to California to be with her son after he decides to drop out of school and become a surfer.\n\nThe film had a limited release in theaters and was released on video on demand beginning on May 1, 2015 by Screen Media Films.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAn editor for a publisher in NYC, single mother Jackie Durning has been on top of her son Angelo his whole life. From a very young age, she has been grooming him to become a writer. He gets into NYU to major in writing, but he lacks self-confidence as she's always been his biggest critic and editor.\n\nAngelo travels cross-country to California to spend some time with his father Peter's family in the summer before starting classes. Although Jackie had asked him to call when he landed, it takes her five days to reach him. When she stops by Angelo's NYU dorm room to drop off some things, she's told he's dropped out.\n\nJackie immediately goes home to pack a bag and flies to California. Not having told anyone, she has her driver Ramon take her to outside of Peter's. They stay watching all night until dawn, when Angelo comes out with a surfboard. They follow him to a beach, where they see he's become a surfer.\n\nAs Jackie hasn't called for a while, Angelo calls her but she lets it go to voicemail. He mentions an e-mail he'd sent her, explaining he wants to experience life far from NYC. As Jackie insists Ramon follow so closely, they accidentally touch bumpers. Discovering his mother is following him, Angelo confronts her and tells her the NYC life doesn't interest him, but Santa Monica does.\n\nJackie insists she can figure out how to surf, regardless of Ramon's scepticism. Ian, a nearby surfer, comes when Ramon insists she's having difficulty. Jackie hires Ian to teach her, eventually realizing she needs instruction.\n\nAfter their second day of lessons, Jackie and Ian sleep together. The next day at the beach, when they come across Angelo and his surfing friends, she, Ian and Ramon follow them to an outside cafe. Mother and son address each other by their first names, and the younger group soon leaves. As Angelo accidentally drops a bag of weed, Jackie decides to try it again. Becoming very giggly, she confesses that she got fired.\n\nThat evening, Jackie shows up at Peter's. She meets his pregnant second wife and their young daughter. Going up to Angelo's room, she interrupts him with a female friend. Angelo confronts Jackie, telling her she's smothered him ever since his brother's accidental death and he wants no more of it.\n\nThe next day, Jackie and Ian agree to see each other, but she flies back to NYC first. She gets her second son's ashes to disperse in the ocean. A few days later, on Angelo's birthday, Jackie gets him to meet her at the beach so he can see her surf.\n\nJackie announces that she's moving to LA and will no longer smother him. In turn Angelo announces he's gotten his spot back at NYU, after sending off his surfing friends who are heading to college and contemplating the older writer he'd met. Mother and son surf together before they each go on their own way.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nHelen Hunt as Jackie[1]\n\nLuke Wilson as Ian[1]\n\nBrenton Thwaites as Angelo[1]\n\nLeonor Varela as Danielle[1]\n\nDavid Zayas as Ramon[1]\n\nRichard Kind as Boss[1]\n\nMike White as Roger[1]\n\nJay Huguley as Co-Worker[1]\n\nCallum Keith Rennie as Tim[1]\n\nDanielle Lauder as Karen[1]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 30, 2013, Deadline reported that Helen Hunt would star, direct and produce her script of a surf film Ride.
