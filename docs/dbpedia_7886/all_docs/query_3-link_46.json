        "text": "In case you’re all wondering, yes, Brenton Thwaites IS as good looking in person as he is on screen. He’s also very endearing and as you’ll soon see, a great actor to carry on the Pirates of the Caribbean legacy. As the son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Brenton Thwaites plays Henry Turner and is on a quest to free his father from the Flying Dutchman. The fantastic news is that you don’t have to wait any longer to see what all the fuss is about, because Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is in theaters today! First, get the scoop on Brenton Thwaites, right here, from my exclusive interview with him.\n\nGetting Involved with Pirates of the Caribbean\n\nBrenton auditioned for the film multiple times. The movie was pushed back a year or so, he auditioned again and then got the call.\n\nStepping in as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann’s son\n\n“I feel as though as it was kind of easier than not having them because they provided such a backstory for my character. We start the movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales with the boy version of my character, basically saying, you know, I believe there’s a treasure that can break your curse, and I can spend more time with you. And he says, okay, well if there is, go find Jack Sparrow. He can help you find it. And so I feel like the goal and obligation for my character has already been set, and that kind of gives Henry a lot more drive and focus for the whole movie.” – Brenton Thwaites\n\nWorking with Johnny Depp\n\n“It was terrifying!” Brenton says working with Johnny is terrifying because you never know what he’s going to say or do, and it always results in humiliation….for Brenton. He says Johnny is “irreverent and impulsive. As an actor it kind of improves your acting in the sense that you’re always open and free and relaxed to go with the flow, but also pretty terrifying.” Brenton reported that he and Kaya were constantly found with their heads down, trying to hide their laughter, as Johnny talked.\n\nGiving input as a newcomer\n\nWhen asked if it was difficult to be a newcomer to the Pirates family, or if the directors valued his input, the is what Brenton had to say:\n\n“I think they did value my input as an actor- as a newcomer. There were so many different characters coming into this one to make it a fresh new thing, and I think all the old-school dudes really wanted to make it fresh and exciting and something they hadn’t done before. So Javier coming on board, myself, Kaya, and the two new directors who had primarily done independent films were kind of supported and encouraged on this one.”\n\nBreakthrough Performer of the year\n\nBreton Thwaites was recently named the breakthrough performer of the year, and here is how he feels about it. “When I first heard of CinemaCon and to get that award, I had no idea what it was, to be honest. I did a bit of research and looked at the guys that had received that award in the past five/ten years and kinda just went, wow, I don’t think I’m in that caliber of actor with those guys. But just to be even considered or thought of in that same group of actors is really exciting.”\n\nA typical day\n\n“Typically a day on a set for me is- I get picked up eight o’clock. I get out of the house at seven; I run down for a quick surf. I rush home; I’m half an hour late, So my driver speeds down the highway and risks our lives trying to get to work on time. And then I get made up and sit in the trailer for five hours while makeup and sets get ready, and then we start working”\n\nHamilton Island\n\nBrenton’s favorite place to shoot for this movie was Hamilton Island, on the Great Barrier Reef. He said White Haven Beach was a beautiful squeaky beach. The best part was when Javier was done shooting a scene, he was “like a five year old kid, you know? As soon as he finishes a scene, he’s stripping off, and jumping in the sea, playing, and like fighting in the sand. It was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.” This I’d like to see!!\n\nNow that we all know Brenton a tad better, it’s fun to see him as Henry Turner in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. I hope you enjoy watching him as much as I did.\n\nI was provided an all expense paid trip for the purpose of covering the new Pirates of the Caribbean and Bambi releases.
