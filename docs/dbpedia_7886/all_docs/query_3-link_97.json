        "text": "The last time we saw Henry Turner was with his mother, Elizabeth Swann when they stood on the shore to wait for Will Turner’s ship, the Flying Dutchman, to appear. Due to the curse he is only able to appear for one day every ten years. Henry Turner, a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy played by Brenton Thwaites, is now all grown and on a mission to break the Flying Dutchman’s curse.\n\nHenry soon finds that he will need to team up with Captain Jack Sparrow and Carina, a young astronomer on her own quest. They find their paths cross with Barbossa on their hunt for the trident of Poseidon while trying to stay alive while Salazar, the ghostly pirate is in pursuit of Jack.\n\nOur exclusive interview with Brenton Thwaites showed his humor and smile that lit up the room. He will surely be a heart throb for the next generation opening Today! Friday May 26th in theaters.\n\nT2T: How did you become involved on the film?\n\nBT: I auditioned a multiple amount of times with Ron and Chris here in L.A., and then I met the directors at a place in Venice Beach, and then the movie got put on hold for awhile, and I re-auditioned about a year later, or a little bit more. And then I met Jerry Bruckheimer and the producers, and then I just, and then I got cast out of nowhere.\n\nT2t: What’s it like stepping into a role with having Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner as your parents, and having to take that story on?\n\nBT: I feel as though as it was kind of easier than not having them because they provided such a backstory for my character. We start the movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales with the boy version in my character, basically saying (to his father Will), I believe there’s a treasure that can break your curse, and I can spend more time with you. And he says, okay, well if there is, go find Jack Sparrow. He can help you find it. And I feel like the goal and obligation for my character has already been set, and that gives Henry a lot more drive and focus for the whole movie.\n\nWhen asked, What was it like working opposite Johnny Dep and the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow?\n\nBrenton said simply, “It was terrifying.”\n\nThen adding, “It’s still terrifying. It’s always terrifying because you never know what he’s gonna say or do and it always results in humiliation for me. So you are always entering a scene thinking this guy now is five movies worth of Jack Sparrow.” “He’s on the ball and kind of irreverent and impulsive. You anticipate what he’s gonna do and say, so that’s great because as an actor it improves your acting in the sense that you’re always open and free and relaxed to go with the flow, but also pretty terrifying.\n\nT2T: How many locations did you film at, and did you have a favorite location?\n\nBT: We shot at about five or six different locations; mainly the studios. I was talking about Saint Martins Square twenty minutes west of the studios where all the mud was. We shot there for a good month and a half, and we shot in Northern New South Wales; they had a beautiful beach called Hastings Point for our entrance into, our entrance into Saint Martins, I think the coastal element.\n\nAnd my favorite location was up on Hamilton Island, shooting out on the Great Barrier Reef. We had some days we shot at a beach called Whitehaven Beach which is a beautiful squeaky beach. You know, when you walk on the sand, it squeaks which is not so good for the sound, but it’s great for effect, and it looks beautiful, and I think we had the most fun right there.\n\nBrenton also gave us a little insight on Javier when filming on Whitehaven Beach, “Javier’s like a five year old kid, as soon as he finishes a scene, he’s stripping off, jumping in the sea, playing, and like fighting in the sand. It was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThis is a must-see movie. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead men Tell No Tales Opens today!
