        "text": "Review: 'The Giver' too predictable and heavy-handed\n\nCritic%27s review%3A 2 stars\n\nThe cast is game but given little to do.\n\nIt%27s not a bad movie%2C just one that falls flat.\n\nIn a crowd of young-adult works about dystopian futures%2C the film doesn%27t stand out.\n\nThe future doesn't look bright.\n\nNot if you judge by movies based on young-adult novels, anyway. Whether it's \"The Hunger Games\" or \"Divergent\" or now \"The Giver,\" one would surmise that we are heading toward a dystopian future in which various of our freedoms will be curtailed or taken away completely. It'll be up to a teenager to save the day, or at least bridge the gap between sequels.\n\n\"The Giver,\" a rather lackluster, too-obvious effort, is no different in any of those regards. Based on the much-loved, oft-taught book by Lois Lowry, director Phillip Noyce's film is set in a near future that would seem to be a utopia. There is no pain, no war, no class distinction. Everything is black and white. No joke; the scenes at the beginning of the film are monochrome.\n\nOf course, there is also no freedom of choice, or freedom of anything, really. No love, no romance, no hugging and kissing. Makes you wonder where all the people come from. Everyone dresses in the same drab, white outfits. All the kids ride the same kind of clunky, white, one-speed bicycles. (Hills seem to have been removed from the equation.) Mention words like \"love\" and you get smacked down with a \"precision of language!\" admonition.\n\nOnce a year there is a ceremony in which all of the kids who are becoming adults are assigned jobs by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep, no less). They have no say in the matter, of course; it's all decided for them by the Elders. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) awaits anxiously as his friends Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) are given their jobs.\n\nJonas won't get one. He is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory. He alone will know man's real history, with all of its ugliness and — duh — beauty, and will use this wisdom to help the Elders run the place. The current Receiver (Jeff Bridges) thus becomes the Giver; during sessions at his bunker-like library (the only books left in society are housed here), he passes everything, good and bad, to Jonas.\n\nThese scenes are among the film's strongest. It's a crash course in what a 15-year-old would probably string together as history's most important events, along with life's experiences. Flowers bloom, people die. They could have said \"circle of life\" and been done with it, but Disney would doubtless protest.\n\nWhatever the case, the visual mash-up as Jonas receives the information (by clasping hands with the Giver) is exciting, if somewhat rushed. (There's a lot of history to cover, if you're going for all of mankind.)\n\nJonas begins to see in color, and to realize that maybe this seemingly perfect society isn't so perfect after all. What transpires deviates from the book but surprise anyone who has seen this type of movie before (and, given the glut of them, that group probably includes ... I don't know, every girl 16 and younger, probably).\n\nThe cast is good but not given much to do in terms of real acting. Alexander Skarsgard is so muted as Jonas' father, for instance, that he's practically somnambulant. Katie Holmes, as Jonas' super-strict mother, meanwhile, is ... well, Katie Holmes.\n\nThis isn't a terrible movie. It just falls flat, in almost every way. It exists and not much else.\n\nIt's all too predictable, and way too heavy-handed. Movies like this don't trust their audience enough, as opposed to, say, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" or \"The Spectacular Now,\" two young-adult films based on books that let their audiences discover what they're trying to say, instead of hitting them over the head with it.\n\nFor \"The Giver,\" you might as well wear a helmet.\n\nReview: 'The Giver,' 2 stars\n\nDirector: Philip Noyce.\n\nCast: Brenton Thwaites, Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep."
