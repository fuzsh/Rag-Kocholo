What’s next–Fahrenheit Fantastic 451?”\n\nDue to popular demand, Spider-Man ’84 will pick up where Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends left off in the early eighties.\n\n“I needed the cash, so I let Sexy Lexy take a ride in my clown car–if you know what I mean.” Marvelous Movies has declined to print Quinn’s full statement."
