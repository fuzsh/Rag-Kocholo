        "text": "We have an interesting trailer and a poster for you today for a new crime thriller called A Violent Separation. The trailer has a lot of twists and turns and has a very heavy, sad feeling to it that touches on love, loss, murder, and loyalty, all while navigating complicated family relationships in a small town. The movie stars Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent, The Giver) as:\n\n“a Sheriff's deputy named Norman Young (who) is faced with an impossible decision: arrest his older brother Ray for murder or help him cover it up. Norman chooses family. As the ensuing investigation withers, neither of the brothers are prepared for the weight of their guilt or how that guilt will strain their loyalty to each other when a passionate romance blossoms between Norman and the victim’s younger sister, Frances. Family bonds are tested as impossible choices must be made to protect the ones they love.”"
