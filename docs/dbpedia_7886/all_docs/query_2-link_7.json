The film is set to begin shooting early next year and 13 Films is handling international sales on the project at AFM this week. Written by Benjamin Hurley, the pic follows a young man who mysteriously awakens in a super high-security office building.

Craig Perry and Sheila Taylor of Practical Pictures will produce with Content Media’s Tom Butterfield. Dan Spilo of Industry Entertainment will executive produce. Thwaites stars in Disney’s upcoming sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales alongside Johnny Depp. He is repped by WME and Industry Entertainment.\n\nWatch on Deadline"
