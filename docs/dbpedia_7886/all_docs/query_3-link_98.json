        "text": "More on The Giver\n\nMovie session times\n\nFull movies coverage\n\nAustralian actor Brenton Thwaites was unemployed when he was offered the chance to star with Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep in The Giver. Unlike Jennifer Lawrence, who initially hesitated with The Hunger Games, the 25-year-old Thwaites says he didn't think twice before signing onto the science-fiction film, based on Lois Lowry's beloved 1993 novel.\n\n\"I was unemployed, looking for a job, and I got it,\" the laidback rising star says.\n\nHe was drawn to the story about a future society where pain, suffering and emotions don't exist – except in memories handed down to his character, Jonas. On top of that there was the drawcard of working with Bridges and Australian director Phillip Noyce.\n\n\"(So) I just went for it,\" he says. \"I probably should have stopped and thought about it, but I don't tend to do that. Maybe I should more often.\"\n\nLife certainly has changed for the former Home and Away star. Earlier this year, you might have seen him playing Prince Phillip in Angelina Jolie's Maleficent. Now with The Giver, he is on his way to becoming a household name.\n\nWith major movies in the pipeline – including in Son of a Gun with Ewan McGregor, Ride with Helen Hunt, and Gods of Egypt with Gerard Butler – Thwaites' star power is only set to climb.\n\nBut the Cairns-born actor hasn't let Hollywood go to his head.\n\n\"I was a big Big Lebowski fan (so) meeting Jeff for the first time I was pretty star-struck.\"\n\nHe admits that Brad Pitt's visit to the Maleficent set was another big moment. \"But it quickly fades because you have a job to do and you do your best work in a relaxed environment.\"\n\nIf anyone is going to spread a chilled-out vibe on set, it's Bridges. The Oscar winner, who has been trying to get The Giver onto the big screen for nearly two decades, apparently has an interesting way of articulating things.\n\nThwaites says because Bridges is a musician, it's like everyone on set is in a band. \"So he uses those words, like 'dance' or 'let's just jam on this scene for a little bit'.\"\n\nAnd its Bridges' attitude that Thwaites tries to keep in mind while navigating Hollywood. \"One minute you're auditioning and you're unemployed, the next minute, you've booked a huge movie,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't know how actors do it man, (but you) just got to relax, take it easy, wait for the next thing to come and don't freak out.\"\n\nThe Giver opens on September 11.\n\nAAP"
