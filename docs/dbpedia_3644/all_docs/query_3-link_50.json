        "text": "Allocating ZIP Codes to Census tracts, Counties, or CBSA\n\nThe address ratios in 3 files listed below can be used to allocate data from the ZIP code to Census tracts, counties, or Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA). In these files the denominators used to calculate the address ratios are the ZIP code totals. All three files share an identical structure with the exception of the geographic codes in the second column, which differs between the three crosswalk files – tract, county, and CBSA – respectively.\n\nZIP - Tract\n\nZIP - County\n\nZIP - CBSA\n\nWhen a ZIP is split by any of the other geographies, that ZIP code is duplicated in the crosswalk file. In the example below, ZIP code 03870 is split by two different Census tracts, 33015066000 and 33015071000, which appear in the tract column. The ratio of residential addresses in the first ZIP-Tract record to the total number of residential addresses in the ZIP code is .0042 (.42%). The remaining residential addresses in that ZIP (99.58%) fall into the second ZIP-Tract record. So, for example, if one wanted to allocate data from ZIP code 03870 to each Census tract located in that ZIP code, one would multiply the number of observations in the ZIP code by the residential ratio for each tract associated with that ZIP code. Note that the sum of each ratio column for each distinct ZIP code may not always equal 1.00 (or 100%) due to rounding issues.\n\nZIPTRACTRES_RATIOBUS_RATIOOTH_RATIOTOT_RATIO 03870330150660000.00420.00000.00000.0039 03870330150710000.99581.00001.00000.9961\n\nZIP5 digit USPS ZIP code TRACT11 digit unique 2000 or 2010 Census tract GEOID consisting of state FIPS + county FIPS + tract code.

In these files the denominators used to calculate the address ratios are the totals of each type of address in the tract, county or CBSA. All three files share an identical structure with the exception of the geographic codes in the first column, which differs between the three crosswalk files – CBSA, County, and Tract – respectively.\n\nTract - ZIP\n\nCounty - ZIP\n\nCBSA - ZIP\n\nWhen a Census tract, county or CBSA is split by a ZIP code, that tract, county or CBSA code is duplicated in the crosswalk file. In the example below tract 01001020200 is split by two different ZIP codes, 36008 and 36067, which appear in the ZIP column. The ratio of residential addresses in the first tract-ZIP record to the total number of residential addresses in the tract is .0272 (2.72%). The remaining residential addresses in that tract (97.28%) fall into the second tract-ZIP record. So, for example, if one wanted to allocate data from Census tract 01001020200 to the ZIP code level, one would multiply the number of observations in the Census tract by the residential ratio for each ZIP code associated with that Census tract. Note that the sum of each ratio column for each distinct ZIP code may not always equal 1.00 (or 100%) due to rounding issues.\n\nTRACTZIPRES_RATIOBUS_RATIOOTH_RATIOTOT_RATIO 01001020200360080.02720.00340.02780.0217 01001020200360670.97280.99660.97220.9783\n\nTRACT11 digit unique 2000 or 2010 Census tract GEOID consisting of state FIPS + county FIPS + tract code.

As a result, there may be some 5-digit USPS ZIP codes that will not be included in these crosswalk files. Less than 1% of the total number of active 5-digit ZIP codes in the country are excluded from the current version of the crosswalk files. Since the HUD geocoding base map is updated regularly, an effort is made to re-geocode these records with every new quarter of data. As a result, these crosswalk files will be generated on a quarterly basis and may differ slightly from quarter to quarter.\n\nWhen are Crosswalk Files typically posted?\n\nWe try to publish the Crosswalk Files by the end of the month following the quarter. For example, we aim to publish fourth quarter by the end of January, first quarter by the end of April, and so on.\n\nDo ZIP Codes align with political or administrative boundaries?\n\nZIP Codes do not align with political or administrative boundaries. ZIP Codes frequently cross county, city, and town jurisidctions. ZIP Codes may also potentially cross state borders.\n\nAre names for ZIP codes available?\n\nNo. Unfortunately, the underlying data used to create the Crosswalk Files does not contain USPS Recommended City Names. However, Recommended City Names can be searched on the USPS ZIP Code Lookup page. Please note that Recommended City Names do not match Census defined names, please see Misalignment Between ZIP Codes and Municipal Boundaries: A Problem for Public Health for an analysis.\n\nWhy do ZIP Codes appear multiple times in the Crosswalk Files?\n\nZIP Codes have the potential to intersect with multiple geographies. Each record in the Crosswalk File represents a geography that intersects with a particular ZIP Code. For example, if you are reviewing a ZIP to County file, if a ZIP Code appears twice then it intersects with two counties. The ratio fields describe the percentage of the respective addresses that fall in both that ZIP Code and each county.\n\nAre Crosswalk Files available prior to 2010 Q1?\n\nUnfortunately, Crosswalk Files are not available prior to 2010 Q1.\n\nAre Crosswalk Files available for the 9-digit (ZIP+4) level or the 3-digit level?\n\nNo.\n\nAre PO Box only ZIP Codes available in the Crosswalk Files?\n\nNo.\n\nAre annual Crosswalk Files available instead of quarterly?\n\nNo. The files are a snapshot in time at the close of a quarter.\n\nDo the address ratios change over time?\n\nYes. As addresses are created or removed, this changes the ratios in the associated geographies.\n\nWhy is there a large jump in the number of addresses from 2011 to 2012?\n\nMany addresses were added when the USPS implemented their Move to Competitive program.\n\nWhat type of organizations use the Crosswalk Files?\n\nIndustries that use these questions include but are not limited to health, financial, energy, policy/think tank, government, and journalism organizations. Many students also use the files."
