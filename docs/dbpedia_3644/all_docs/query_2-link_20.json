        "text": "Although the name may vary from country to country, you will find a postal code system similar to the US's ZIP codes wherever you go. It makes the ZIP-code system one of the very few universally accepted systems in the world.\n\nBut what makes the ZIP-code (Postal Code) system so special? Why does almost every country in the world adopt it? Why are we still using it even after so many years with only minor changes made to it? The simplest answer to the question “What is zip code?” is that they are the postal code system used in the US.\n\nHowever, that does not answer the question. ZIP codes help businesses of all kinds with their day-to-day operations. Product or mail delivery, in particular, is dependent on ZIP codes for accurate and fast delivery.\n\nTo understand what a ZIP code, is and the different cases where we can use it, you should begin with its origin. Reading further on will take you through the history. Furthermore, we will also attempt to understand the ZIP code from a global perspective.\n\nAs we move along, we will discuss the significance of the ZIP code in business operations. In addition to that, the article also elaborates on the US ZIP codes list and how you can get all 41,000+ ZIP codes. Finally, we also look at how you read a ZIP code and use it effectively for your business.\n\nWhy Are ZIP Codes Important?\n\nZIP Codes are not just data that postal service providers use to optimize their postal delivery process. Even though some of you may find it hard to believe it, the ZIP Codes play a significant role in business operations in the US.\n\nSending Bills And Invoices\n\nBusinesses of all kinds have to send bills and invoices to their customers. These are essential documents. If the customer receives it late or does not receive it at all, they could miss the payment.\n\nHaving a full ZIP+4 code for the addresses ensures that the mail is delivered without any delays. This is why businesses employ address verification tools like PostGrid. You can get access to the full ZIP+4 Code of all your addresses using PostGrid's bulk address verification.\n\nFraud Detection\n\nZIP codes enable businesses to conduct a quick check on their background. You can see which addresses are accurate and deliverable by pushing them through address verification tools like PostGrid. So, you can sort the real and fake addresses and detect any fraud in the address data provided by the customer.\n\nDemographic Information\n\nZIP codes can be used by businesses to get access to demographic information. This data can prove vital for your business's marketing effort. For example, you may determine specific demographics likely to buy a product or service from you. Tools like PostGrid even come equipped with geocoding capabilities to target your campaigns for higher response.\n\nHistory of ZIP Codes\n\nAs we have mentioned before, the ZIP-code system first came into existence back in the 1960s. However, the first postal code system in the US was employed decades earlier, in 1943. In the beginning, postal zones were used instead of ZIP codes. However, these zones were only created for large cities.\n\nIt was only in the early 60s that it became evident that a more organized postal coding system was required. This was when they first introduced the ZIP code – a 5-digit ZIP code implemented throughout the nation.\n\nState Abbreviations\n\nThe US Post Office Department or USPOD also published a list of abbreviations with ZIP codes. So, the capitalized abbreviations that we have for US states are a result of ZIP code implementation. All of us are familiar with the two-letter abbreviations that are used to denote states.\n\nInitially, the plan was to use abbreviations that ranged between two and five letters. But, it was later decided to use capitalized two-letter abbreviations. The new standard abbreviations are based on a maximum 23-position line. Shorter abbreviations further made the ZIP codes easier to understand and sort.\n\nEarly ZIP Code System\n\nPostal inspector Robert Moon first proposed the early ZIP code system in 1944. Although the early ZIP codes are five digits, Moon is only credited for the first three digits of the IP code that we now use.\n\nThe first three digits of the ZIP code are used to identify or describe a Sectional Center Facility, also known as SCF. It acts as the central mail processing facility, which sorts the mail to different post offices that fall under it.\n\nThe last two digits of the five-figure ZIP code were proposed by Henry Bentley Hahn Sr. Fourth and fifth digits further narrow the location of the address within the SCF. Hence, the postal authority used these two digits to sort the mail once it reached the SCF.\n\nIntroduction of ZIP+4 Code\n\nThe USPS introduced a more elaborate ZIP code system known as ZIP+4 Codes in 1983. They are also known by the names “plus-four codes,” “add-on codes,” or “add-ons.” When writing an address with a full nine-digit code, the ZIP+4 codes follow the original five-digit ZIP code.\n\nIt is also worth noting that each Post Office Box has its own unique ZIP+4 Code. Generally, the last four digits of the PO Box number are used as the ZIP+4 Code for PO Box addresses. Similarly, they could also use zero plus the last three or two digits of the PO Box number.\n\nPostal Bar Code\n\nThe ZIP code written on a mailpiece is converted into an Intelligent Mail Barcode to efficiently process mail. Barcodes enable automated machines to sort the mail, saving them valuable time and effort. In addition, the sender may choose to print the barcode themselves via some word-processing programs.\n\nHowever, it is not preferred because the information the sender has may be out of date. So, it is best to leave the postal barcode printing to the post office. They use OCR technology for printing the postal bar codes and also use a manual process if necessary.\n\nBusinesses or organizations that send bulk mails can get a discount on postage if they print the barcode themselves. However, to do this accurately, you'd need the help of a CASS-certified direct mail service provider like PostGrid.\n\nSolutions such as PostGrid can access the USPS's official address database and print accurate postal barcodes on your mailers. This way, not only does your direct mail get processed faster, but you also get to save money on postage.\n\nHow Does a ZIP Code Area Work?\n\nWe know that ZIP codes are five-digit numbers that help the USPS to make fast and timely deliveries. The five-digit ZIP code represents post offices all across the US. There are different names by which the ZIP codes are known worldwide, but the concept remains the same everywhere.\n\nThe five-digit ZIP codes can be split into three major parts, and they are as follows:\n\nNational Area\n\nRegion or City\n\nDelivery Area\n\nFurthermore, it is also worth noting that the USPS has segmented the whole country into 10 ZIP Code areas. These ZIP Code areas start from the northeast and are numbered 0-9. This means that the first digit can tell you which state the mailer is supposed to go to.\n\nThe following table can help you understand the destination of a mailer based on the first digit of its ZIP Code.\n\nDigit Destination ZIP Codes starting with 0 Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virgin Islands, Army Post Office Europe, Fleet Post Office Europe ZIP Codes starting with 1 Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania ZIP Codes starting with 2 District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia ZIP Codes starting with 3 Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Army Post Office Americas, Fleet Post Office Americas ZIP Codes starting with 4 Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio ZIP Codes starting with 5 Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin ZIP Codes starting with 6 Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska ZIP Codes starting with 7 Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas ZIP Codes starting with 8 Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming ZIP Codes starting with 9 Alaska, American Samoa, California, Guam, Hawaii, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, Palau, Washington, Army Post Office Pacific, Fleet Post Office Pacific\n\nAlso Read: What are FIPS Codes?\n\nAs you are already aware, the ZIP Code is not just random numbers thrown together. Each digit in the ZIP Code number has a specific role to play. We have already discussed how the first digit in the ZIP code denotes the state to which the direct mail is addressed.\n\nSecond Two Digits of ZIP Codes Indicate the City\n\nThe USPS assigns the second two digits in a ZIP Code to denote a city. If a specific geographical region has a central town or city, then the first ZIP Codes are assigned to that city. Once that is done, the ZIP codes get assigned in alphabetical order.\n\nFirst Three Digits Together Indicate the Sectional Center Facility\n\nTogether, the first three digits of the ZIP Code indicate the Sectional Center Facility of the mail piece. The Sectional Center Facility is where mail pieces get sorted and distributed for a specific area or zone.\n\nIt is worth keeping in mind that some Sectional Center Facilities may have more than one three-digit code assigned to them. So, if you do happen to notice a Sectional Center Facility like that, do not get alarmed. However, it does not hurt to double-check the ZIP codes in such cases.\n\nFourth & Fifth Digits Indicate The Area of The City/Town\n\nThe area of the city or town in which the mailer is addressed is indicated by the fourth and fifth digits of the ZIP Code. This greatly simplifies the mail sorting and delivery process at the local level and enables USPS to make optimal delivery routes.\n\nAs you can see, each number in the US ZIP code serves a purpose. The USPS effectively uses the ZIP-code system to ensure that your direct mail is delivered without any delays. Therefore, having the wrong ZIP code for your addresses can stand in the way of efficient direct mail delivery.\n\nBusinesses should use address verification tools like PostGrid to get access to the full ZIP code of addresses. This way, you can ensure that your direct mail does not encounter any unnecessary delays.\n\nMany of you may not know this, but the US is one of the member countries of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). It means that whatever postal delivery standards developed and followed by the US align with UPU's guidelines. Doing so ensures the free exchange of global mail with minimal hiccups.\n\nUniversal Postal Union\n\nThe Universal Postal Union or UPU is a regulatory body that functions under the United Nations. One of the crucial functionalities of UPU is to build new postal systems for developing countries. UPU accomplishes this by utilizing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology from the US.\n\nCountries like the United States primarily fund UPU. However, the benefits UPU receives from its top funding members like the US goes beyond monetary ones. For example, UPU also gets access to the ZIP-code system used by the US and its expert knowledge regarding postal service.\n\nCanada Post Postal Codes\n\nThe UPU provides specific guidelines to maintain universal standards for postal services around the world. However, that is only possible to a certain extent because, in real-life situations, the postal codes of two countries may look nothing alike. You can see this if you compare the postal codes in Canada and the US.\n\nZIP codes are created explicitly for addresses in the United States. Furthermore, the ZIP codes are managed by the official postal authority of the country, which is USPS. When it comes to postal codes in Canada, the system is controlled by Canada Post.\n\nEarly History\n\nSimilar to the US, Canada also maintains a well-refined postal code system that enables easy and fast mail processing. The first postal system in Canada evolved in the 50s and 60s and initially used a three-digit postal code system. However, the system later evolved to become a six-digit system in 1969.\n\nUnderstanding Canada Postal Code\n\nCanada Post uses an alphanumeric postal code. The first three digits in the postal code are called Forward Sortation Area or FSA. Canada Post corresponds geographical regions like a province to an FSA. The remaining three digits of the six-digit postal code correspond to an LSU or Local Delivery Unit.\n\nThe LDU usually includes a group of addresses, and they act as the local level of address for making mail deliveries. Direct mail first gets sent to the FSA, from where the mail gets sorted and forwarded to LDUs, where the final sorting happens. Finally, the mail is then delivered to the addressee.\n\nSimilarities to ZIP Codes\n\nThe postal code employed by Canada Post is very similar to the ZIP code used by the USPS. Consequently, the major mailing processes of both Canada Post and the USPS are more alike than different. The major mail operations that are classified similarly by both postal service providers are listed below.\n\nMail sorting\n\nAutomation\n\nDemographic data management"
