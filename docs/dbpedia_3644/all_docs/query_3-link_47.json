        "text": "Dear all,\n\nProblem\n\nThe dataset I use includes address data. I would like to be able to dissect my data visually based on the different postal code regions as incorporated within the address column, in which the postal code regions are shown. This can be done using the Filled Map visual. Initially I set this up using the postal code column in the 'location' field and the postal code column in the 'legenda' field. However, when setting this up, several of the postal code regions are located outside of the Netherlands (in Belgium), which is incorrect, since the data only describes addresses in the Netherlands. This is also the case if I remove the postal code column from the 'legenda' field of the visual. I can understand why this problem arises, since postal code regions can be the same for different countries. I have tried different solutions to no avail. These solutions are described in the next paragraph. Images of my data and the visual itself can be found at the end of the message.\n\nTried solutions\n\nThe following list highlights several solutions I have tried, which are derived from the links to other threads, as shown using the links in the list. None of these solutions seem to work for my situation. The images at the end of the message highlight the results for these solutions.\n\nCreate a new calculated column with concatenated postal code with country and place, in several different configurations, and use this column in the 'location' field of the visual --> The visual does not appear to understand this input, no data is shown. While the regular 'map' visual does understand this input, the 'filled map' visual does not;\n\nhttps://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Problem-with-map-and-postal-code/m-p/11072/page/2\n\nhttps://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Incorrect-map-location/m-p/19374\n\nInclude both a country and postal code column in the 'location' field of the visual, and use the drill through option to show only the postal codes. --> This does not result in a drilled through option, only in a country wide region view;\n\nhttps://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-can-I-locate-Places-on-map-using-PostalCode/td-p/123407\n\nhttps://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Map-showing-wrong-locations-even-with-country-added/m-p/531...\n\nUsed the modelling tab to set categorisation for specific columns to either address or postal code. --> This results in the same error as initially present (no change): postal code regions shown for both the Netherlands and Belgium;\n\nhttps://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Map-showing-wrong-locations-even-with-country-added/m-p/531...\n\nRename the columns when placed inside the location field of the visual to names such as 'zipcode', 'postal code', 'postal region', 'region', 'postal code + country', 'country + postal code', etc. --> This results in the same error as initially present (no change): postal code regions shown for both the Netherlands and Belgium;\n\nhttps://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/MAP-showing-wrong-locations/m-p/208772\n\nQuestion\n\nIt seems as if the solutions as described above do not work as intended for the 'filled map' visual, as they do for the 'map' visual. Can anyone provide me with an explanation as to what I am doing wrong? Images on my data and the visual can be found below. Thank you in advance!\n\nImages of data & visual\n\nThe 'filled map' visual is shown in the centre. The data used is shown in a table to the right of the 'filled map' visual. The top shows the modelling tab which reveals the categorisation of the selected column. The first image might not be entirely clear due to low contrast: what you see here in the 'filled map' visual is a set of regions in Eindhoven in the Netherlands (top right) and another set of regions in the lower left of Belgium. These regions should all lie in Eindhoven.\n\nMany thanks and kind regards,\n\nSjef Hereijgers"
