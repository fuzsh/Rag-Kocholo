        "text": "What is the PCCF? | PCCF Retired File | PCFRF File | PCCF+ | PCCF vs PCCF+ | More PCCF Resources | How to access PCCF Data\n\nWhat is the PCCF?\n\n(Source: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/92-154-X)\n\nCensus data do not include postal codes. Therefore, if you have data with postal codes which you want to link to rich data from the Census, the Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) is probably the tool for you!\n\nThe Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) links six-character postal codes to standard geographic areas such as dissemination areas, census tracts, and census subdivisions. By linking postal codes to standard geographic areas, the file facilitates the extraction and subsequent aggregation of data for selected geographic areas. The PCCF also associates each postal code with a longitude and latitude coordinate to support mapping applications.\n\nNote: The March 2024 update of the Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) is now available.\n\nNew versions of the PCCF are released with each census and aligned with new census geographic areas. Limitations and usage of the PCCF can be explored in the\n\nFor even more information about the PCCF series, review this presentation:\n\nMore things to note regarding the updated PCCF and PCFRF Files:\n\nThe Postal Code Project is responsible for linking the approximately 900,000 single postal codes in Canada to Statistics Canada’s Census dissemination geography (presently 2021 Census geographic areas).\n\nThe term population centre will replace the term urban area. A population centre will be defined as an area with a population of at least 1,000 and a density of 400 or more people per square kilometre. All areas outside population centres will continue to be defined as rural area. This new terminology will be implemented consistently across the Agency.\n\nPopulation centre and rural area classification has been added to the file.\n\nPopulation centres will be divided into three groups based on the size of their population to reflect the existence of an urban-rural continuum:\n\nsmall population centres, with a population of between 1,000 and 29,999;\n\nmedium population centres, with a population of between 30,000 and 99,999;\n\nlarge urban population centres, consisting of a population of 100,000 and over.\n\nPCCF Retired File\n\nPostal codes retired before January 1, 2016 are included in a separate file available with the PCCF. The retired PCCF is now being released quarterly so it will be included in each release (where as in the past it was only released every 5 years). The record layout is the same as the PCCF so they share the same reference guide (available above).\n\nPCFRF File\n\nThe December 2022 update of the Postal Codes by Federal Ridings File (PCFRF) (2013 Representation Order) is now also available. This product, a subset of the PCCF, provides a link between the six-character postal code and Canada's federal electoral districts (commonly known as federal ridings). The \"unique link\" variable indicates if the postal code is linked to one or more federal electoral districts (FEDs). When the postal code is linked to more than one FED, the \"weight\" variable estimates the proportion of the population of the postal code that resides within each FED.

PCCF+ automatically assigns a range of Statistics Canada’s standard geographic areas and other geographic identifiers based on Postal Codes. The PCCF+ differs from the PCCF in that it uses population-weighted random allocation for Postal Codes that link to more than one geographic area. It also includes options for institutional postal codes and procedures to link partial codes to geographic identifiers where possible.\n\nThe PCCF+ also Includes:\n\nNeighborhood income quintile\n\n(An income quintile is a measure of neighbourhood socioeconomic status that divides the population into 5 income groups (from lowest income to highest income) so that approximately 20% of the population is in each group)\n\nImmigrant tercile\n\nA set of data arranged in order with values that partition the data into three groups, each containing one-third of the total data)\n\nHealth regions and alternate health regions\n\nAirstage (isolated fly-in communities)\n\nIt also outputs a problem file to identify postal codes for: hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, university residences, coroner’s offices, children’s aid societies, public trustees, government offices. Included in this problem file are problem records, diagnostics and reference information for possible solutions.\n\nNote: The latest issue of this publication was the Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+), Version 8A based on the 2021 census.\n\nThe postal code reference date includes postal codes up to December 2022\n\nThe residential flag (ResFlag) and institutional flag (InstFlag) have been updated\n\nUpdated air stage offices (January 2023)\n\nFor more information, review the following resources:\n\nDocument:\n\nPCCF+Userguide-2021.pdf (1.11 MB)\n\nThis webinar on the Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+): How it works, when to use it, and how to use it. As well as these slides on setting up and running the PCCF+\n\nQueen's University PCCF+ Guide\n\nYouTube video on how to use the PCCF+ and SAS\n\nUniversity of Toronto's PCCF+ Guide\n\nDocument:\n\nSettingupPCCF+_PowerPoint.pdf (1.4 MB)\n\nPCCF vs PCCF+\n\n(Source: https://guides.library.queensu.ca/c.php?g=710466&p=5062245)\n\nThere are situations where a postal code can span over multiple census geographies.\n\nThe PCCF file contains a Single Link Indicator (SLI) field to indicate the geographic area with the majority of dwellings assigned to a particular postal code.\n\nThe PCCF+ is a SAS program using a population weighted random algorithm to increase accuracy where postal codes span over more than one geographic area.\n\nThe PCCF, using the single link indicator, forces all the postal codes into DA1 since it has the highest population. The PCCF+, using the population-weighted random allocation for postal codes, assigns postal codes to each of the 3 DAs according to their size. So, in this example, 60% are assigned to DA1, 30% to DA2 and 10% to DA3.\n\nMore PCCF Resources\n\nTo learn more about PCCF data, visit the <odesi> repository by going to our main page and clicking on <odesi> website:\n\nClick ‘Browse’ in the top right-hand corner and click through the Geography>Canada>PCCF tabs on the left-hand side.\n\nExplore the documentation to learn more about the PCCF!\n\nAlso, check out the following resources:\n\nIllustrated glossary of the census geography areas\n\nHierarchy of standard geographic areas for dissemination, 2021\n\nDissemination Geography Unique Identifiers\n\nChoosing census geography\n\nPCCF Guide from the University of Toronto\n\nPCCF+ Guide from the University of Toronto\n\nPython script to parse the PCCF\n\nR Script to Extract and Parse the PCCF Database\n\nHow to access the PCCF Data\n\nTo access the data please follow the steps below:\n\nRead Carleton University's End-Use Licence Agreement for Postal Code Conversion Files;\n\nThen, contact Data Services."
