A food pantry gets its food from a food bank and gives it directly to people.\n\nVisiting for the first time might feel scary, but friendly volunteers are there to help.\n\nWhen you arrive, they may ask questions or have you fill out a form about your family's needs. These questions help them give you the right amount of food and connect you with other programs."
