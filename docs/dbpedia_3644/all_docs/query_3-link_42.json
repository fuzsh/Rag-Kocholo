        "text": "Category: Boundaries Data Type: Polygon GIS data Steward: UGRC\n\nZone improvement program (ZIP) code boundaries are an ongoing effort to approximate the geographic extents of five digit ZIP codes as polygons. The dataset was produced using a combination of methods and is based on several sets of source data. Editing methods include:\n\nUsing local ZIP code polygon data obtained from counties and cities.\n\nIdentifying place locations (cities, towns, populated areas, etc.) from the postal service website and address information system (AIS) and building ZIP code boundaries around these places.\n\nUsing the 2000 Census TIGER line fileâ€™s ZIP code attributes.\n\nTip\n\nZIP codes are primarily used for mail delivery by the United States Postal Service (USPS). They do not represent specific geographical areas or boundaries.\n\nIn addition, UGRC has used the locations of mailing addresses known to be valid to fine tune this dataset. The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset. Users are encouraged to attribute content to: State of Utah, SGID.\n\nUpdate history\n\nApril 2022 - Improved boundaries in Davis county\n\nNovember 2019 - Added 84765 polygon for Motoqua in Washington County\n\nJanuary 2019 - Added 84059 ZIP code in Utah County\n\nFebruary 2016 - Updated 84321, 84235, 85326, 84332, 84339\n\nJuly 2015 - Split the 84095 (South Jordan) ZIP code along the Bangerter Hwy to create the new ZIP code 84009 (South Jordan)\n\nJanuary 2015 - Improvements were made to 84773 (Teasdale) and 84775 (Torrey)\n\nJanuary 2015 - Adjusted the 84747 (Loa) and 84716 (Boulder) ZIP code boundaries to follow the address grid quadrant boundaries"
