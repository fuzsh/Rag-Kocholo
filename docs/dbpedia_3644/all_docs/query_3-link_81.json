        "text": "A ZIP Code is a five digit numeric code that identifies a collection of mailing addresses within the United States and its territories to simplify the distribution of mail by the United States Postal Service (USPS).\n\nA ZIP Code is a delivery sort sequence and the USPS does not associate an area with each ZIP Code. Said another way, ZIP Codes are lists of addresses for delivering the mail. They are not areas. However, many ZIP Codes have delivery areas, and some ZIP Codes are for buildings or campuses that have defined borders. Boundaries can also be created by grouping small areas (defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for their nationwide street map) based on the dominant ZIP Code of the addresses in each small area, but this is an approximation because carrier routes may overlap and portions of the country have no deliverable addresses. The ZIP Code areas often do not adhere to boundaries of cities, towns, counties, or states.\n\nEvery ZIP Code can be shown as a point. The point is at the post office for the ZIP Code, if there is one, or, if the ZIP Code can be shown as an area, at a central location within the ZIP Code area.\n\nMapping Software for ZIP Codes\n\nThough the ZIP Code areas are approximations, Maptitude Mapping Software includes the most accurate ZIP Codes on the market.
