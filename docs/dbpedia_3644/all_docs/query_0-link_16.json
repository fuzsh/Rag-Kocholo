        "text": "City in Utah, United States\n\nThis article is about the city in Washington County. For the census-designated place in Morgan County, see Enterprise, Morgan County, Utah.\n\nCity in Utah, United States\n\nEnterprise is a city in northwestern Washington County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,711 at the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nA post office called Enterprise has been in operation since 1899.[4] It was settled largely by residents of the town of Hebron, later abandoned. The town was so named for the settlers' enterprising plan to find a water supply.[5] Cattle ranchers thrived in the area, but the town needed a consistent water supply to sustain themselves and for agriculture to spread. The settlers decided to take on the ambitious project of constructing a dam. Many thought that the dam would be impossible to accomplish and left the area. The rest of the settlers began work on the dam. With a lot of work and little return, the dam was completed, and the reservoir has supported the town ever since.[6]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nEnterprise is located on the south rim of the Great Basin, at an elevation of 5,329 feet (1,624 m).\n\nEnterprise is about 40 miles northwest of St. George and 45 miles southwest of Cedar City\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.9 square miles (7.5 km2), all land.\n\nEnterprise is the nearest community to Mountain Meadows.\n\nThe hillside letter E can be seen in the southwest.
