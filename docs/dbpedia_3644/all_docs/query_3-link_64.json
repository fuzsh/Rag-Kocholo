ArcGIS Enterprise portals use geosearch and geocoding locators.\n\nGeosearch (also known as location search)—Locate an address or point of interest and have the map zoom to that location. The result can be displayed on the map, but the result is not stored in any way for later use. Geosearch is available to anyone who accesses Map Viewer or a public app that includes a location search on a map.\n\nArcGIS Enterprise uses the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service to find addresses, cities, landmarks, business names, and postal codes in more than 100 countries around the world. Additionally, ArcGIS World Geocoding Service is used to find the location of x,y coordinates using longitude and latitude.\n\nIf your organization wants to optimize search results for addresses and places of interest, members with privileges to create content can create a new view of ArcGIS World Geocoding Service to search only for specific types of locations within an area of interest. For example, you might create a locator view to limit search results to a particular country or area or to only return results that match a specific category such as street addresses or airports. Once you create a locator view, members of the default administrator role can configure the organization so it uses your locator view when members perform geosearches.\n\nIn addition, if your organization needs to geocode addresses or places based on its own data, administrators can configure your organization to use its own locators running on an ArcGIS Server site, for geosearch, geocoding, or both. For example, an oil organization could add locators to search their oil wells, or a city could add a locator to find their fire hydrants.\n\nIf you add additional locators or locator views, members see an arrow in the geosearch box and can choose which locator or view to use.\n\nCreate a locator view\n\nYou can create a new view of ArcGIS World Geocoding Service to search only for specific types of locations within an area of interest. For example, you may want a locator view to limit search results to particular areas, or you may want to enforce a specific level of precision when members perform batch geocoding of addresses.\n\nThe option to create a locator view is available only if your portal is configured to use the Esri World Batch Geocoder.\n\nLocation types and categories\n\nThis section describes the location types, categories, and subcategories available when you configure your locator view.\n\nAddresses, Postal Codes and Populated Places\n\nWhen you choose Addresses, Postal Codes and Populated Places as the types of locations you want to find, you can further refine the locator view's search results by selecting the categories and subcategories you want to search. The following categories for Addresses, Postal Codes and Populated Places are available:\n\nAddress—Selecting this category automatically includes all of the address subcategories listed in the table below. This category limits search results to places that can be categorized as addresses while filtering out results for places of interest, postal codes, countries, or states. For more precise search results, choose any combination of address subcategories that meet your search requirements.\n\nPostal—Selecting this category limits search results to any type of postal code match, including 5-digit and longer postal code formats. To limit search results to matches that are at least this precise, select both the Postal category and the top-level Address category.\n\nPopulated Place—Selecting this category automatically includes all of the populated place subcategories listed in the table below. This category limits search results to administrative divisions (or boundaries), such as cities, provinces, or countries, while filtering out results for addresses, places of interest, and postal codes. For more precise search results, choose any combination of populated place subcategories that meet your search requirements.\n\nCategorySubcategoryDescription\n\nCoordinates\n\nWhen you choose Coordinates as the types of locations you want to find, you can further refine the locator view's search results by selecting the categories you want to search. These are described in the table below.\n\nCategoryDescription\n\nPlaces of Interest\n\nWhen you choose Places of Interest as the types of locations you want to find, you can further refine the locator view's search results by selecting the categories you want to search. These are described in the table below.\n\nCategoryDescription"
