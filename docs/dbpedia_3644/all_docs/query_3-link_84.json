        "text": "ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) \"are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent the most frequently occurring five-digit ZIP Code found in a given area. Simply put, each ZCTA is built by aggregating 2010 Census blocks, whose addresses use a given ZIP Code.\"\n\nThere is a single, really big CSV file for viewing the relationships between ZIP Codes and census tracts for the entire United States. It includes over 60,000 census tracts and over 40,000 ZIP Codes, and there are multiple lines for many of the census tracts, resulting in a 22 MB Excel file with 25 columns and 148,898 rows.\n\nThe boundaries of ZIP Codes and census tracts often don't match. If looking up which census tracts relate to a single ZIP Code, that overlap of boundaries doesn't create a major problem in terms of relative social and economic characteristics, but the counts won't be precise. If the analysis is being done for an area larger than a single ZIP Code, then just add up the data directly from the census tracts rather than converting their data to ZIP Codes.\n\nDon't add up the ZIP Code data by allocating all of the data for each census tract to each ZIP Code which overlaps with each census tract and then summing the results; many of the census tracts would be counted multiple times unless additional steps were taken to deduplicate them. The example below shows the results for all of the ZIP Codes in Lake County, Florida; each of the Lake County census tracts in red appears in more than one ZIP Code (0301.02 would be counted five times). Instead, leave ZIP Codes out of the calculation and just add up the data for the selected area by census tract.\n\n32102 - 0301.02 (plus 1 external tract)\n\n32134 - 0301.02 (plus 9 external tracts)\n\n32159 - 0304.07, 0304.08, 0304.09, 0304.10, 0304.11 (plus 4 external tracts)\n\n32195 - 0304.11 (plus 2 external tracts)\n\n32702 - 0301.02, 0301.04, 0301.05 (plus 1 external tract)\n\n32720 - 0301.02, 0301.06, 0301.07 (plus 13 external tracts)\n\n32726 - 0301.05, 0302.03, 0302.04, 0302.06, 0302.07, 0302.08, 0302.09, 0308.07\n\n32735 - 0302.07, 0303.05, 0303.06\n\n32736 - 0301.05, 0301.06, 0301.07, 0301.08, 0302.03, 0302.06, 0309.02\n\n32757 - 0302.03, 0308.07, 0309.02, 0309.12, 0309.13, 0309.14, 0310.00 (plus 2 external tracts)\n\n32767 - 0301.02, 0301.07\n\n32776 - 0301.08, 0309.02 (plus 2 external tracts)\n\n32778 - 0303.08, 0307.02, 0308.03, 0308.04, 0308.05, 0308.06, 0308.07, 0310.00\n\n32784 - 0301.04, 0301.05, 0301.07 (plus 1 external tract)\n\n34705 - 0310.00, 0313.01\n\n34711 - 0312.02, 0312.04, 0313.05, 0313.06, 0313.07, 0313.08, 0313.09, 0313.10, 0313.11\n\n34714 - 0312.02, 0313.11 (plus 1 external tract)\n\n34715 - 0312.04, 0313.01, 0313.07, 0313.09\n\n34731 - 0304.05, 0304.06, 0304.07, 0305.04, 0306.01\n\n34736 - 0311.01, 0312.02, 0312.03, 0312.04, 0312.05, 0313.11\n\n34737 - 0311.02, 0311.03, 0313.01\n\n34748 - 0303.02, 0305.02, 0305.03, 0305.04, 0306.01, 0306.02, 0307.01, 0307.02, 0311.01, 0311.02, 0312.03, 0312.04\n\n34753 - 0312.03, 0312.04, 0312.05\n\n34756 - 0313.01\n\n34762 - 0311.01, 0311.02\n\n34787 - 0313.06, 0313.07, 0313.08 (plus 6 external tracts)\n\n34788 - 0303.02, 0303.05, 0303.06, 0303.07, 0303.08, 0307.02\n\n34797 - 0311.02\n\nIn the four-county Orlando metropolitan area multiple ZIP Codes exist in the census tracts 270 times. For example, Lake County census tract 0301.02 includes portions of ZIPs 32102, 32134, 32702, 32720, and 32767.\n\nThe tables below provide all of the ZIP Codes (actually ZCTAs) for the Orlando MSA (Lake, Orange, Osceola, & Seminole counties), extracted from the national CSV file. NOTE: Some of the ZIP Code boundaries may have changed since 2010.\n\n48 of the ZIP Codes also cover some census tracts in neighboring counties outside of the Orlando MSA. The tables below include lines for each of those external census tracts, but those external census tract numbers are not listed in the Census Tract column (see instead the Tract Code column). For example, ZIP 32134 covers a portion of Lake County census tract 0301.02, plus six census tracts in Marion County and three census tracts in Putnam County. Marion County Tract Code 401 translates to Census Tract 0004.01.\n\nOrlando MSA ZIP Codes in 2010:\n\n32102-32195 (Lake)\n\n32701-32798 (Lake, Orange, Seminole)\n\n32801-32839 (Orange)\n\n33848-33896 (Osceola)\n\n34705-34797 (Lake, Orange, Osceola)\n\n34972 (Osceola)"
