        "text": "integer\n\nThe schema revision of the PostalAddress. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision.\n\nAll new revisions must be backward compatible with old revisions.\n\nstring\n\nOptional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.\n\nIf this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default).\n\nExamples: \"zh-Hant\", \"ja\", \"ja-Latn\", \"en\".\n\nstring\n\nOptional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. \"Barcelona\" and not \"Catalonia\"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.\n\nstring\n\nUnstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.\n\nBecause values in addressLines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language.\n\nThe minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a regionCode with all remaining information placed in the addressLines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved.\n\nCreating an address only containing a regionCode and addressLines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas)."
