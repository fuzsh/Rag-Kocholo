The United States Postal Services (USPS) introduced a postal code service known to the common public as Zip Code all the way back in 1963. Just as the acronym suggests, USPS‚Äô intentions for this code was to allow mails and other products to be sent from one location to another efficiently. USPS‚Äô registration for the word ‚ÄúZip Code‚Äù expired in 1997 and is now being used all over the globe for its original purpose. Here is how the little process is done:\n\nHow does ZIP code work?\n\nA ZIP Code is five digits long but is never four or six. It is always a fixed number of digits that changes depending on the location. Each location has a fixed ZIP code that never changes as well. The five digits are broken down into:\n\nFirst digit represents the broader are, from zero to nine. Zero represents the far Northeast, while nine represents the far West.\n\nSecond and third digits represent the central post office facility of that region. For example, a central post office in Los Angeles will have different second & third digits as compared to a central post office in Springfield.\n\nThe final two digits of the ZIP code are meant to symbolize the small post office or postal zone. This is usually for post offices in a certain city. A post office in the Faircrest Hills of Los Angeles may have different last two-digit codes as compared to Beverly Hills.\n\nTypes of ZIP Code:\n\nHere are four types of ZIP codes, depending on where they are used:\n\nUnique ‚Äì these are assignment to a single high-volume address, such as a warehouse.\n\nPost Office Box-only ‚Äì these are assigned to PO Boxes of a certain facility and are only for use by the post office.\n\nMilitary ‚Äì special ZIP codes used exclusively by the military for mail.\n\nStandard ‚Äì the normal ZIP codes that are given to a post office in any region.\n\nLicence\n\nCreative Commons 4.0\n\nData Source\n\nGeonames\n\nWikipedia\n\nMade for developers , by developers\n\nUsing this dataset a developer will be able to:\n\nConnect apps to the database and consume date via an GraphQL API\n\nCopy the database, edit and consume data via an REST API\n\nDownload the database in a JSON or CSV format\n\nAdvantages for a developer\n\nSave time looking for boilerplate data\n\nSave time with our ready to use APIs\n\nConnect to multiple dataset with a single API key\n\nGet Started\n\nNodeJS - Fetch Data with Node JS Code\n\nJavaScript - Fetch Data with Java Script Code\n\nSwift - Fetch Data with Apple Swift Code\n\nObjective-C - Fetch Data with Apple Objective-C Code\n\nKotlin on Android - Fetch Data with Kotlin on Android\n\nKotlin - Fetch Data with Kotlin\n\nJava on Android - Fetch Data with Java on Android\n\nPHP - Fetch Data with PHP\n\nPython - Fetch Data with Python\n\nJava - Fetch Data with Java\n\nFlutter - Fetch Data with Flutter\n\nDart - Fetch Data with Dart\n\nPlease check more ready to use example in our ZIP Code API Playground\n\nZip Code for all 50 US States Covered\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nArizona\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nHawaii\n\nIdaho\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nIowa\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nMississippi\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska\n\nNevada\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew York\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nPennsylvania\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nVermont\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWisconsin\n\nWyoming\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHere are some FAQs you might need to know:\n\nPricing\n\nAll data is free to use.
