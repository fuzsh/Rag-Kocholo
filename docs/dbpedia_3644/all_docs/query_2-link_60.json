        "text": "Utah System of Higher Education Board Policy R512, of which we are legally bound by, says,\n\n“3.1 “Continuous Utah Residency for One Full Year” means the student has resided in Utah for 12 continuous months prior to the term for which the student is seeking resident student status…\n\n5.2.3 Determining Resident Student Status: The burden is on the student to prove that they are eligible for resident student status…\n\n5.3.5 Student Who Has Come to Utah for the Purpose of Attending an Institution of Higher Education: A student who has come to Utah for the purpose of attending an institution of higher education may be granted resident student status if, prior to the first day of classes of the term for which the student seeks resident student status, the student has: (1) maintained continuous Utah residency for one full year…”\n\nThe applicant applying for the Undergraduate One Year Rule Policy is required to start their 12-month continuous timeline a minimum of 12 months immediately prior, within no more than 23 months (one year and 11 months) immediately prior, to the term the student is applying for resident student status.\n\nFor example, if a student wants to apply for resident student status for Fall 2026 (semester starts August 2026), they must have the requirements for a 12 continuous month period going back no farther than September 2024:\n\nSeptember 2024 to September 2025 or\n\nApril 2025 to April 2026 or\n\nDecember 2024 to December 2025\n\netc.\n\nThe University of Utah Residency evaluator staff will default the processing of the application to a 12 continuous month period immediately prior to the term for which the student is seeking resident student status. The student must request in writing if they would like a different 12 month period to prove their continuous Utah residency.\n\nProof of physical presence records MUST have all 3 of the following on them:\n\nStudent’s name\n\nExact dates\n\nProof of an event happening in Utah\n\nWe have a number of accepted methods for proof of physical presence including:\n\nEnrollment at the University of Utah or another Utah institution\n\nEmployment with a Utah employer\n\nBank or credit card statements showing purchases made in-person and in the state of Utah at least once every 7 days or fewer\n\nGym punch-in records in the state of Utah at least once every 7 days or fewer\n\netc.\n\nThe complete list of accepted methods can be found here.\n\nAny form of proof of physical presence in Utah submitted is subject to review and acceptance is not guaranteed.\n\nThe applicant applying for the Undergraduate One Year Rule Policy is required to start their 12-month continuous timeline a minimum of 12 months immediately prior, within no more than 23 months (one year and 11 months) immediately prior, to the term the student is applying for resident student status.\n\nThe University of Utah Residency evaluator staff will default the processing of the application to a 12 continuous month period immediately prior to the term for which the student is seeking resident student status. The student must request in writing if they would like a different 12 month period to prove their continuous Utah residency.\n\nProof of physical presence records MUST have all 3 of the following on them:\n\nStudent’s name\n\nExact dates\n\nProof of an event happening in Utah\n\nMany records cannot prove that the student applying for resident student status was at an event in Utah, such as an in-person purchase in a store or an in-person class at the University of Utah for example. Other records are not accepted due to their unreliability, such as cell phone records or social media records.\n\nThe following CANNOT be used to demonstrate proof of physical presence (this list is not exhaustive):\n\nUtah utility bills\n\nUtah leases or rental agreements\n\nW-2s\n\nPresence of Utah property\n\nPersonal statements\n\nLetters from friends/parents/landlords\n\nRecords from apps such as DoorDash, UberEats, Uber, Lyft, Venmo, Door Dash, GrubHub, etc\n\nPhotographs or images of people/locations\n\nSocial media posts such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc.\n\nCell/Mobile phone records\n\nTime spent on University of Utah-sponsored programs, that are out of state, but with supporting documentation and institutional verification, still count as proof of your physical presence in Utah.\n\nIn order for any time outside of the state of Utah to count as in-state, our office would need to see proof that it is a University-sponsored program:\n\nSubmit a signed and dated letter on letterhead from the University of Utah organizing department\n\nLetter must have student’s name, the exact dates of the program, and where the program was physically located\n\nPrograms MUST BE organized or sanctioned by the University of Utah\n\nLetter needs a U of U staff member contact information and signature\n\nThis pertains to internships, sports or study abroad sponsored by the University of Utah.\n\nIf it is not a University-sponsored program, then your internships, sports or study abroad would count as outside the state of Utah. Programs from University of Utah affiliates are not accepted (clubs, faith groups, sororities/fraternities, etc.).\n\nFor the Undergraduate One Year Rule Policy, you must show proof of physical presence for 12 continuous months in Utah.\n\nYou may not have more than 29 days total with presence unaccounted for or outside of the state of Utah.\n\nIf you are unable to prove your presence for any days requested, those days will be listed as absences and will count against your 29 day total with presence unaccounted for or outside of the state of Utah.\n\nEach time you visit the Residency window and request a Physical Presence Check-In, our staff will review your two forms of ID (University of Utah ID card and other photo ID required; the driver’s license or state ID can be from any location as long as it is valid) and record the timestamp of your visit in an internal log.\n\nWhen you submit your Residency Reclassification Application, we will utilize your check-in records towards your proof of physical presence requirements.\n\nPhysical Presence Office Check-Ins at the Residency Office window, at least once every 7 days or fewer (Example calendar of every 7 days) will count one week (or less, whichever is counted first) towards the requirement.\n\nExample: if you do 52 office check-ins every Wednesday for a full year, and there are 52 weeks in the year, then your proof of physical presence requirement will be fully completed\n\nNo. If you are not employed or do not make enough to file, we can use your parent or guardian’s taxes to determine if you are not claimed as a dependent on the federal taxes of a non-Utah resident.\n\nIf you made little or no income in the previous year, you may also qualify for free tax preparation assistance with the “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance”, or VITA, program; find out more here at the United Way of Salt Lake.\n\nWorking remotely for an out of state company will not impact your residency status as long as you can provide proof of physical presence in Utah. If your pay stubs show that your employer deducts Utah state income taxes for your work (see an example here and another example here), you can use those pay stubs as proof of physical presence in Utah. If you don’t have proof like that, you can still use other forms of proof of physical presence in Utah to meet the requirement.\n\nIf you are able to provide additional documentation to overcome the reason(s) for your denial, you may be able to appeal your denial. Please contact our office and make an official request for an appeal via email at residency@utah.edu. This appeals meeting must be requested within ten business days of the date of your denial letter.\n\nIf a denial is upheld by the Residency Officer after your first appeal, and you wish to appeal further, you have a right to request a second appeal with the full Residency Appeals Committee. Again, you must request a hearing with the committee within ten business days of the Residency Officer’s final appeal decision.\n\nThere is no appeal process for retroactive residency, for incomplete applications that were removed after the census deadline or applications submitted after the semester’s tuition deadline.\n\nIf a technical error prevents you from uploading your documents through the application process or through the Post Submission Form, please take screenshots of the error messages, and also let us know what internet browser you are using. We can forward that information to our technical systems team to evaluate if there is a larger problem that needs to be fixed.\n\nPlease do not use a mobile device to submit an application, or to try to upload documents using the Post Submission Form; mobile devices are blocked from our document processing system. You must use a desktop or laptop computer.\n\nFor best results, please check that you are using a supported browser before starting to fill out your form, and only use:\n\nBrowser Version Apple Safari 15 and newer Google Chrome 101 and newer Microsoft Edge on Chromium 101 and newer Mozilla Firefox 100 and newer Mozilla Firefox ESR 91 and newer\n\nWe also accept documents via email to residency@utah.edu. Please include your full name, date of birth, and UNID when submitting documents over email. Our email server is not encrypted, and we strongly recommend using one of our encrypted, dual-factor authentication systems to submit documents to us.\n\nIf you will meet the 12 months of physical presence by the start of the semester that you are wishing to reclassify, please submit an application by the tuition deadline of that semester.\n\nWe will work with you to submit additional documents to complete your residency application and requirements.\n\nPlease Note: Applications submitted between the day after the application deadline to the tuition deadline are late. We will work on these applications until the census deadline. Incomplete applications are removed after the census deadline. We cannot guarantee a decision by the first day of the semester for late applications.\n\nTime spent on University of Utah-sponsored programs, that are out of state, but with supporting documentation and institutional verification, still count as proof of your physical presence in Utah.\n\nIf you must leave the state during the 12 months in which you are attempting to qualify for reclassification to satisfying the requirements for other internships, courses, study abroad programs, or athletic training, this time will count against the 29 days total with presence unaccounted for or outside of the state of Utah.\n\nOur office requires verification of independence/dependence through tax documents.\n\nYou can cross out any sensitive information as long as we are able to see who is claimed as a dependent or if you are able to be claimed as a dependent.\n\nWe also need to see that they the tax documents were submitted to the IRS. Tax returns submitted must be signed by the taxpayer to verify submission to the IRS. If the taxes were electronically filed, proof of an e-signature is required. If tax returns do not have a signature, other means of verifying submission of the tax return to the IRS will be required\n\nProcessing time depends on the time of year and our volume of applications, and if we need to reach out to you for more information.\n\nWe recommend you submit your application as soon as possible. Applications submitted by the application deadline are guaranteed to receive a decision by the first day of the semester you are applying for residency.\n\nApplications submitted between the day after the application deadline to the tuition deadline are late. We will work on these applications until the census deadline. Incomplete applications are removed after the census deadline. We cannot guarantee a decision by the first day of the semester for late applications.\n\nDo you meet the requirements of the Undergraduate Policy/One Year Rule?\n\nIf you have not started your graduate program, you are eligible to reclassify under any qualifying policy prior to starting your graduate program.\n\nThe only exceptions is students admitted by the School of Dentistry, College of Law and the School of Medicine as non-residents, as they are held to the policies of their respective schools."
