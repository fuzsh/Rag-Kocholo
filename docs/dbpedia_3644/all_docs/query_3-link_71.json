Two segments make up a postal code: Forward Sortation Area (FSA) and Local Delivery Unit (LDU).\n\nThe FSA is a combination of three characters (alpha-numeric-alpha). It identifies a major geographic area in an urban or a rural location.\n\nThe LDU is a combination of three characters (numeric-alpha-numeric). It identifies the smallest delivery unit in an FSA."
