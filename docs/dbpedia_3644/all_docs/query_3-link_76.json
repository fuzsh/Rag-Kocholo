        "text": "The postal codes had a massive impact on all the activities related to postal delivery, and this goes for every country in the world. A system that is simple yet effective enough to manage the postal operations of big countries such as the US. As an address verification company that works closely with postcodes, we can’t help but get a little excited when talking about the origin of postal codes.\n\nSo the story begins when the cities in the US start to grow bigger and bigger. As the cities kept on growing, the delivery of postal mail also became more and more challenging. Soon there were not enough postmen or post offices to deliver all the letters; keep in mind that this was at a time when letters were the only means of communication for the vast majority of the population.\n\nThe most obvious solution at this point was to simply meet the increased demand for postal services was optimizing the logistic capability of the postal body. To optimize the logistical capabilities, more post offices were built and more postmen were hired. But the problems were only beginning because the postal delivery was potentially a management nightmare.\n\nWhy? Because despite having new post offices and new postmen to deliver the mails, it still did not rectify the problem of how one would find the different addresses.\n\nThere were a lot of questions that were left unanswered, such as which post office would deliver to an address that is exactly halfway between two post offices.\n\nAn efficient way had to be developed that is productive in a way that none of the resources went to waste.\n\nA similar situation prevailed in different parts of the world during the time. It was in London that they first started using postal codes in the late 1800s. London was subdivided into ten different districts to meet the postal delivery requirements and is often signified as the first source of postal codes. They called these newly classified districts postal districts or postal zones.\n\nTo keep track of them effectively, they were all numbered, and that is how “postal district numbers” or “postal zone numbers” came into being. Although during the First World War, such systems already existed in various European countries, the one from London is often regarded as the origin.\n\nThe US began using the postal code system a bit later but not later than the 1920s. Since then, the postal delivery system has gone through numerous changes and optimized for better and faster deliveries. Even with all the progress that we have made since then, the district numbering system is still the foundation on which the modern-day postal codes are built.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nUsing Postal Codes Across the Country for Every City and State\n\nThe postal code that had its inception in London was merely the tip of the iceberg. The district code created in London was a primitive one because it only ever covered a big city and nothing more. As one would expect from a new system, even though it had some sound logic behind the first postal code was not effectively implemented. The system was perfected over the years and evolved into what we now see around the world.\n\nFor starters, the first postal code was created only for big cities like London. It was never equipped to cover larger areas like states or the country. They lacked the systematic superiority to implement them on a larger scale. It was the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic that first implemented a country-wide postal code system back in 1932. However, this did not last as they failed to implement it efficiently, and it was finally discontinued in 1939.\n\nIf you are looking for a functioning example of a postal system in history, then you will have to go to Germany in 1941. Even though they were dealing with the war at the time, the Germans still managed to keep effective postal communication throughout the country. Later in 1963, the US also joined the club by implementing the ZIP-code system. In the meantime, it took another decade for the UK that actually begin the practice of postal code to implement it nationwide.\n\nBut we have not once had to look back ever since the introduction of a nationwide postal code system. The beauty of the system and probably the reason that it has not been replaced by an alternative system is its ability to expand. It allows countries to expand and accommodate new or additional areas simply by adding new digits to the already existing code."
