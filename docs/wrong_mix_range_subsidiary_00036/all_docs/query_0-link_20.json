        "text": "Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) is making major inroads into the multibillion global sequencing market thanks in large part to the success of its newest long-read sequencing system, Revio. Though the high-fidelity (HiFi) whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology on which Revio is based is highly accurate to begin with, PacBio has tapped into the machine learning and algorithm development capacities of Google to improve it further. On August 7 the company unveiled a new Revio-related strategic venture with Google to evaluate the system’s capacity for improving diagnosis of genetic conditions in neonatal care.1\n\nThe New PacBio-Google Revio Collaboration\n\nNeonatal care could be a major opportunity for PacBio and other developers of WGS technology. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on July 11, 2023, found that WGS outperformed conventional gene panels in diagnosing babies with suspected genetic conditions.2\n\nUnder the new deal, PacBio will team with GeneDx, the genome testing and interpretation firm previously known as Sema4, and the University of Washington to perform a study called SeqFirst at Seattle Children’s Hospital. The objective of the project, according to the PacBio press release announcing the collaboration, is to determine “whether whole genome sequencing of children with suspected developmental differences at point-of-diagnosis, as opposed to conventional diagnostic evaluations, will lead to earlier, more rapid diagnoses, reduce costs of these diagnoses, and improve therapeutic outcomes.”1\n\nGeneDx will use the Revio system for the study to perform long-read WGS sequencing and analysis of samples from 350 people, including 120 samples from participants in the SeqFirst study. The researchers will also use short-read sequencing technology to analyze the samples, looking out for novel variants associated with specific genetic conditions, particularly those that are detected with Revio but undetected with short-read sequencing. Google’s role will be to provide an undisclosed amount of funding for reagents and other elements of SeqFirst while also developing informatics methods based on project results.\n\nThe Google Advantage\n\nHaving Google at its side has been a major boost for PacBio. Previous research between the companies led to the publication of a 2021 paper finding that Google’s DeepConsensus machine learning tool can increase the yield of highly accurate (99.9% accuracy) HiFi reads by as much as 27 percent per instrument run.3 In January 2022, the partners entered into a new research partnership allowing PacBio to implement DeepConsensus on the Revio system and improve overall long-read WGS performance.4\n\nFor PacBio, the Revio investment has paid off. On August 2, the firm announced that strong sales of Revio drove a 34 percent increase in overall 2023 second quarter year-over-year earnings.5 PacBio placed 45 Revio instruments and two other sequencers during the quarter, up from 36 instruments in Q2 2022. This momentum enabled the company to raise its 2023 full-year revenue guidance to between $185 million and $190 million, or growth of 44 percent to 48 percent, as opposed to its original forecast of $170 million to $185 million.6,7\n\nTakeaway\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence have the potential to improve the performance and accuracy of diagnostics platforms. The PacBio-Google collaboration is an excellent reminder that if your underlying diagnostic technology is sound, you may be able to access the capacities you need to improve it without developing them in-house.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-and-genedx-launch-research-collaboration-with-the-university-of-washington-to-study-long-read-whole-genome-sequencing-for-increased-diagnostic-yield-in-neonatal-care/\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2807081\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.31.458403v1.full.pdf\n\nhttps://www.pacb.com/press_releases/pacbio-and-google-collaborate-to-use-machine-learning-to-optimize-long-read-sequencing-data-analysis/\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pacbio-announces-second-quarter-2023-financial-results-301891955.html\n\nhttps://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PACIFIC-BIOSCIENCES-OF-CA-6797675/news/PacBio-Raises-Earnings-Guidance-for-Full-Year-2023-44542467/\n\nhttps://ca.style.yahoo.com/pacbio-pacb-tops-q1-earnings-153503544.html\n\n****\n\nHere’s
