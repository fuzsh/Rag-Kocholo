Carlos is absolutely right that this\n\nproblem is not always a killer. It depends on a number of factors including\n\nthe nature/size of the system and the frequency of restarts (this off the\n\ntop of my head without actually going back to look at the paper myself). I\n\ndo know that under some conditions the artifacts can be really really bad.\n\nI think we have tried to warn folks about this, but we really have to modify\n\nthe amber code to make reuse of ig in a situation like this harder to\n\nignore); we intend to do this for amber 11).\n\nRegards - Bob\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: \"Carlos Simmerling\" <carlos.simmerling.gmail.com>\n\nTo: \"AMBER Mailing List\" <amber.ambermd.org>\n\nSent: Wednesday, February 18, 2009 9:04 AM\n\nSubject: Re: [AMBER] IG not change at each restart of NPT simulation\n\nI'm not sure sure that I would be that worried- people have done this\n\nfor a while and gotten pretty reasonable agreement with expts. I think\n\nin theory there is a problem, but it's not really that clear that it\n\ncauses severe problems in large, complex systems. I'm not saying that\n\nI disagree with Bob, or the paper cited, just that one needs to be\n\ncareful in looking at the past and saying that since we found a\n\npotential problem that we should throw out our old work. Clearly much\n\ngood work was done with older force fields that we not optimal, and so\n\non. We make lots of approximations in our work, and we often improve\n\nthem but if you understand the limitations of certain methods it\n\ndoesn't mean work done with them should be discounted. It's not as\n\nsimple as saying that simulations with highly complex systems that\n\nused the same ig value and Langevin thermostat are not acceptable.\n\nnothing we do is perfect- the challenge in being successful in this\n\nfield is in understanding and managing the limitations.\n\nOn Wed, Feb 18, 2009 at 8:57 AM, Robert Duke <rduke.email.unc.edu> wrote:\n\n> Jeffrey,\n\n> Sorry, but I would be worried if I were you.
