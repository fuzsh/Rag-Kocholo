K., E-mail: pk-ahluwalia7@yahoo.com and Pathania, Y.},\n\nabstractNote = {This paper presents the results from a molecular dynamics simulation of mixture of argon and krypton in the Poiseuille flow across a rough walled nanochannel. The roughness effect on liquid nanoflows has recently drawn attention The computational software used for carrying out the molecular dynamics simulations is LAMMPS. The fluid flow takes place between two parallel plates and is bounded by horizontal rough walls in one direction and periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the other two directions. Each fluid atom interacts with other fluid atoms and wall atoms through Leenard-Jones (LJ) potential with a cut off distance of 5.0. To derive the flow a constant force is applied whose value is varied from 0.1 to 0.3 and velocity profiles and temperature profiles are noted for these values of forces. The velocity profile and temperature profiles are also looked at different channel widths of nanochannel and at different densities of mixture. The velocity profile and temperature profile of rough walled nanochannel are compared with that of smooth walled nanochannel and it is concluded that mean velocity increases with increase in channel width, force applied and decrease in density also with introduction of roughness in the walls of nanochannel mean velocity again increases and results also agree with the analytical solution of a Poiseuille flow.},\n\ndoi = {10.1063/1.4915458},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22391768}, journal = {AIP Conference Proceedings},\n\nissn = {0094-243X},\n\nnumber = 1,\n\nvolume = 1661,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Fri May 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015},\n\nmonth = {Fri May 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015}\n\n}"
