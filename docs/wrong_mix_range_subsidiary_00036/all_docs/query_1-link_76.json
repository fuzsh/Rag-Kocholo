This is probably because these creatures, also known as sea squirts, are mostly small, gelatinous and transparent, and their patchy distribution in the ocean makes them difficult to study. But they have certain characteristics that potentially make them potent players in the ocean’s carbon cycle. They may even play a significant role in mitigating global warming.\n\nMore Life Than We Ever Realized Could Survive in The Deep Dark of The Ocean\n\nThe Sun gives life to our planet through its rays, and yet some fascinating lifeforms don't need light to live.

Cold temperatures, darkness, high hydrostatic pressures, low oxygen concentrations, and food scarcity characterize the habitat of the deep sea. Moreover, no light penetrates the ocean waters at depths beyond 1000 m below sea level. Even at depths of 150 m below sea level, the light levels are reduced to 1% of the surface, which makes it insufficient to support photosynthesis. However, despite such extreme conditions, different faunal creatures live in the deep sea and have special adaptations that help them survive in the fathomless depths of the ocean. Much deep-sea fauna is still unknown and is yet to be discovered by scientists. The following article discusses some of these mysterious yet fascinating deep-sea creatures.\n\nScientists discover fantastical creatures deep in the Indian Ocean\n\nThe bottom of the ocean is a tremendously inhospitable place to live.

The project results were published this week in Frontiers in Marine Science.\n\nMarine Science Goes to Space\n\nWhen the Cassini spacecraft first flew above the south pole of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, it did something no solar system explorer had done before: It took a shower. The craft zipped through plumes of water vapor and ice grains spewing from cracks in the icy moon’s surface. Cassini didn’t need to towel itself dry because the spray was thin. Combined with the craft’s earlier images, however, it provided strong evidence that a global ocean lies beneath the moon’s crust. Later analysis found hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and tiny particles of rock in the plumes, suggesting the ocean could contain all the major ingredients for life.\n\nU.S. and Australia Team Up to Explore and Map Pacific Ocean\n\nNOAA and two of Australia's leading science agencies announced a formal agreement Tuesday to work together to advance Pacific Ocean exploration and mapping, a major priority for NOAA and of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.\n\nDevastating Puerto Rico 1918 Tsunami Wasn't Caused by a Landslide\n\nSeafloor video collected by a remotely operated vehicle off the coast of Puerto Rico indicates that an underwater landslide was not the cause of a devastating tsunami that hit the island’s west coast after a 1918 earthquake.\n\nSea urchins spotted wearing ‘hats’ at strange party on Atlantic seafloor, video shows\n\nResearchers stumbled, uninvited, onto a strange party on the seafloor, video shows — but even more unusual, there appeared to be a strict dress code to attend. Light from a remotely operated vehicle reveals a “huge” crowd of sea urchins, gathered in the dark roughly 1,350 feet below the surface, all wearing “hats,” made of debris, on the tops of their dome-like bodies, video captured near the U.S. Virgin Islands shows.\n\nSECNAV Names Future Oceanographic Survey Ship USNS Robert Ballard\n\nSecretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Carlos Del Toro announced Dec. 21 that a future Pathfinder-class oceanographic survey ship will be named USNS Robert Ballard (T-AGS 67).\n\nIo may have an underworld magma ocean or a hot metal heart\n\nAn entire ocean of liquid magma, or maybe a hot heart of solid metal, may lurk in Io’s underworld. The surface of Jupiter’s innermost moon is covered in scorching lava lakes and gored by hundreds of active volcanoes, some spitting molten rock dozens of kilometers high (SN: 8/6/14). Over the years, the moon’s restless, mesmerizing hellscape has attracted the attention of many planetary scientists (SN: 5/3/22).\n\nListen to 'the bloop,' a strange noise recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean that stumped scientists for years\n\nIn the summer of 1997, scientists recorded a strange, loud noise originating from an area west of Chile's southern coast. They dubbed it \"the bloop.\"\n\nThe Top Eight Ocean Stories of 2022\n\nIn case you’ve missed any of the biggest saltwater happenings, the National Museum of Natural History’s Ocean Portal team has rounded up the biggest ocean stories of the year here.\n\nThese 3 Bizarre Sea Creatures Have Scientists Stumped\n\nI love a good ocean mystery, from a bizarre \"yellow brick road\" in the Pacific to \"blue goo\" in the Atlantic. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ocean specialists are revisiting some of the strangest things they've seen under the waves. They're still puzzling over three mysterious sightings.\n\nThe deep sea discoveries and sightings of 2022 are fascinating\n\nAn age of discovery is upon us. Big vessels, carrying robust robotic explorers and sometimes submersibles piloted by humans, embark on deep sea expeditions each year. This lightless realm remains a largely mysterious place, and just around 25 percent of the seafloor is decently mapped. Deep ocean missions are often considered the new exploration of little-known — or just never-visited — places on Earth.\n\nWe know very little about our impact on one of Earth's largest ecosystems\n\nStudy highlights need to protect deep sea reefs, warning that the rapidly changing climate could have serious impacts on these important marine environments.\n\nHow much of the ocean has been explored? Surprisingly little\n\nThe oceans have enthralled humanity for millennia. Since the dawn of time, we have traversed the blue horizons in a quest for new nations and adventures. Throughout history, the oceans have been an essential source of survival, transportation, commerce, growth, and motivation.\n\nThe seas of Avatar: James Cameron on the real science behind his fictional world\n\nJames Cameron is diving into the deep: this time, into the oceans of an alien world. The filmmaker and ocean explorer’s latest science-fiction epic, Avatar: The Way of Water, promises to transport viewers to the vibrant aquatic ecosystems of a world 25 trillion miles from Earth, with a documentary’s level of detail.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the viperfish with fangs too big for its mouth\n\nDeep-sea viperfish have razor-sharp fangs so big they don’t fit inside their mouth, but they interlock in front of their jaws forming an inescapable, glassy cage. “When people think of deep sea fishes, the viperfish is one of the first things that comes into their mind,” says Yi-Kai Tea, a fish expert from the Australian Museum in Sydney. “They’re very charismatic, very iconic.”\n\nHow Did Ancient Fish Colonize the Deep Sea?\n\nThe deep sea holds more than 90% of our oceans’ water, but only around one-third of all fish species. Scientists have long assumed that the reason was obvious: shallow ocean waters are warm and rich in resources, making them an ideal environment for new species to grow and flourish. However, according to recent University of Washington research conducted by Elizabeth Miller, there were multiple eras in Earth’s early history when many fish preferred the cold, dark, barren waters of the deep sea.\n\nWhitehouse Secures Major Oceans Policy Wins in NDAA\n\nU.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) released the following statement today on the inclusion of several major oceans provisions in the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The defense bill will accelerate maritime technology innovation, improve ocean and coastal mapping, protect marine mammals, and harden our defenses against pirate fishing, among other important provisions.\n\nMarine sciences must cast off an imperial legacy of ocean exploitation\n\nA century and a half after HMS Challenger embarked on the first global survey of the ocean, some ideas from the era still linger. They urgently need to be left behind, says Helen Scales.\n\nNASA mission will study how hidden ocean swirls soak up heat of global warming\n\nEddies have been overlooked for too long. These turbulent swirls of water, ranging in size from a few kilometers to hundreds of kilometers across, peel off large ocean currents and mix heat and carbon dioxide into deeper ocean layers, like cream stirred into coffee. They are the most energetic feature of the ocean, critical to getting climate models right—but also largely invisible to satellites, except when they happen to sweep up a massive bloom of green phytoplankton.\n\nEngineers Propose an Ambitious Plan to Bury Excess Carbon at The Bottom of The Ocean\n\nOur failure to decisively mitigate climate change is prompting researchers to examine more drastic approaches, like fertilizing the oceans to combat the massive excess of carbon dioxide in our air.\n\nA batfish and a blind eel: Deep sea creatures discovered by researchers in remote ocean\n\nHair-raising photos of newly discovered sea creatures that evolved to survive the world's deepest depths reveal an extraordinary look at life from the abyss.\n\nOceanX and Black in Marine Science Announce Collaboration to Further Scientific Research of the Oceans\n\nGlobal ocean exploration nonprofit OceanX announced today an expansion of its partnership with Black in Marine Science, the premier organization celebrating Black marine scientists, spreading environmental awareness, and inspiring the next generation of scientific thought leaders.\n\nWhat is the latest on the High Seas Treaty?\n\nWe may not think about it often, but our lives draw and depend on the ocean. More than 80% of all goods we consume are transported via the ocean, the ocean absorbs around 30% of the carbon dioxide that we release into the atmosphere and 17% of our food comes from the ocean. Our internet connection relies on submarine cables and we use cosmetics that include marine extracts, not to say about the importance of marine bacteria to produce tests to detect Covid-19.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the squid that makes a decoy out of its own skin\n\nSelf-camouflage is just one of the tricks of Brenner’s bobtail squid, a newly found species that is also helping research into microbes in the human gut.\n\nThe ocean in a cup: Environmental DNA successfully captures marine biodiversity\n\nMeasuring marine biodiversity with \"environmental DNA\" — an application of gene sequencing to environmental biology s—hould permit rapid assessment of changes in marine life. That makes environmental DNA (eDNA) a critical tool for managing our response to climate change. But eDNA only works well if key implementation steps are followed, according to a new study of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area published in the journal PeerJ.\n\nGlassy fangs and glowing fins: amazing deep sea animals found near Cocos Islands\n\nA shipload of scientists has just returned from exploring the uncharted waters of the Indian Ocean, where they mapped giant underwater mountains and encountered a multitude of deep-sea animals decked out in twinkling lights, with velvety black skin and mouths full of needle-sharp, glassy fangs.\n\nFrom a blind eel with gelatinous skin to a hermaphrodite lizard fish with long sharp teeth: Meet the bizarre ocean creatures discovered living near deep-sea volcanoes in the Indian Ocean\n\nA new world of weird and wonderful creatures has been discovered living near deep sea volcanoes in the Indian Ocean. Scientists from the Museums Victoria Research Institute returned from a 35-day expedition mapping the seafloor in Australia's remote Cocos (Keeling) Islands Marine Park last week. During their 6,800 mile (11,000 km) journey, they came face-to-face with a blind eel with gelatinous skin, and a hermaphrodite lizard fish with long sharp teeth.\n\nTerrifying Images Show Monstrous Deep-Sea Creature With Enormous Fangs\n\nDeep in the ocean lives a ghoulish fish with huge and menacing, fang-like teeth. The aptly named common fangtooth fish (Anoplogaster cornuta)—sometimes referred to by its nickname \"ogrefish\"—inhabits deep waters all around the world, occurring at depths between 650 and 6,500 feet, although the species has been observed as far down as 16,000 feet. This makes it one of the deepest-living fish.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the sharks that glow in the dark\n\nKitefin sharks (Dalatias licha) have been known about since the 18th century, but it was only in January 2020 that scientists saw them glowing in the dark for the first time. They are not the only bioluminescent sharks – roughly one in 10 species has that ability – but at up to 1.8 metres, kitefins are by far the biggest that have been found.\n\nPursuing New Frontiers in Ocean Exploration and Characterization\n\nNewly released report identifies strategic priorities for ocean exploration and characterization to improve federal agencies’ understanding and knowledge of previously underexplored marine habitats and ecosystems.\n\nSpace Travel and Deep-Ocean Exploration Are Becoming More Accessible\n\nTravel to earth’s final frontiers is more possible than ever before, with exciting plans on the horizon. The question today isn’t whether you can actually get there anymore, but whether you can afford it.\n\nBlack, Deep-Sea Coral That Can Live in Warm Waters Discovered\n\nScientists have recently announced a new black coral species thriving in warm temperatures. Teams with ocean exploration non-profit OceanX initially made the discovery in 2020 during an expedition in the Neom region of the northern Red Sea in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTiger Sharks Help Scientists Uncover World’s Largest Seagrass Ecosystem\n\n“That’s the last one!” a voice called over the lapping of the ocean waves against the hull of the boat. He was referring to the biologging camera tag - one of seven - attached to the enormous tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) that was being prepped for release. Sweat beaded across the foreheads of the scientists as they high-fived one another, exhausted from both the hard work and the Bahamian sun. Rocking gently in the turquoise waters over the Great Bahama Bank, the boat tilted to the side as everyone leaned over to unhook the shark and watch her swim away into the blue.\n\nEerie creatures of the deep sea\n\nNOAA's Ocean Exploration Team shares what scary creatures are lurking deep down in the dark ocean floor.\n\nScientists astonished by rare octopus and 'zombie' sea sponge in stunning footage\n\nScientists were astonished after they found a rare ‘warty’ octopus and ‘zombie’ sea sponge in deep sea footage. The video, which was captured by marine explorers in the US, showed two profoundly rare sights from underneath the ocean surface.\n\nTraces of ancient ocean discovered on Mars\n\nA recently released set of topography maps provides new evidence for an ancient northern ocean on Mars. The maps offer the strongest case yet that the planet once experienced sea-level rise consistent with an extended warm and wet climate, not the harsh, frozen landscape that exists today.\n\n11,100-year-old trap proves people lived in Alaska 1,000 years earlier than believed\n\nRemains of an elaborate stone fish trap have been discovered on the seafloor off Southeast Alaska, and scientists say it proves Indigenous people occupied the region 1,000 years earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe Case Against Deep-Sea Mining\n\nSeldom do we have an opportunity to stop an environmental crisis before it begins. This is one of those opportunities. The mining industry is on the brink of excavating the deep ocean, creating a new environmental disaster with irreversible consequences for our ocean and climate. We urgently need a deep-sea mining moratorium to thoughtfully assess the full impact before a new crisis is created.\n\nGiant, Horrid Deep-Sea Louse-Like Creature Filmed Feasting on Fish Head\n\nA creepy video captured during a research dive off the coast of Florida shows a deep-sea creature feasting on the head of a fish. The video was featured in the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Office of Ocean Exploration and Research's \"31 Dives of Halloween\" web series, which is highlighting a host of fascinating deep-sea creatures in the run-up to the popular holiday.\n\nIntroducing FathomNet: New open-source image database unlocks the power of AI for ocean exploration\n\nA new collaborative effort between MBARI and other research institutions is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate efforts to study the ocean.\n\nScientists discover a new ecosystem in the deep ocean of Maldives\n\nScientists on a mission in the Maldives have discovered a new ecosystem 500 meters deep in the ocean. The discovery is expected to result in enhanced safeguards for the marine life and fisheries in this special region, according to a press release published on Tuesday by Nekton.\n\nBlue snailfish discovered in the darkest ocean depths\n\nSnailfish are found in all of the world’s oceans, at depths varying from shallow intertidal to the deepest oceanic trenches. Of the approximately 400 identified species, 20 are known from the eastern Pacific, off the west coast of South America. Although the shallow-living species are relatively well studied, those that inhabit the deepest oceanic habitat, known as the hadal zone, are not well known.\n\nHumans can dive deeper into the world’s oceans than ever before with Alvin\n\nBlack smoke appears to rise from chimney-like formations of the hottest and deepest known hydrothermal vents on Earth. Over the summer, Anna Michel was able to see them for herself — a few miles beneath the ocean’s surface. Michel, an associate scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, was part of a three-person crew aboard the submersible Alvin as it dove down to the Mid-Cayman Rise. Known as the Beebe Hydrothermal Vent Field, these vents exist on the ocean floor where two tectonic plates are separating about a half an inch (15 millimeters) per year south of the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe Deepest Part of the Ocean Is Practically an Alien Planet\n\nAlmost three-quarters of our world is covered in saltwater, and, on average, the ocean is about 12,100 feet, or 2.3 miles deep. But in certain places, the sea floor plummets to truly astonishing depths.\n\nYour gaming skills could help teach an AI to identify jellyfish and whales\n\nToday, there are more ways to take photos of the underwater world than anyone could have imagined at the start of the millennia, thanks to ever-improving designs for aquatic cameras. On one hand, they have provided illuminating views of life in the seas. But on the other hand, these devices have inundated marine biologists with mountains of visual data that have become incredibly tedious and time-consuming to sort through.\n\n'Forest of the weird' discovered in Pacific Ocean\n\nIn 2017, as part of an expedition by the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, scientists discovered a ‘forest of the weird’ over a mile beneath the Pacific Ocean. Oddly shaped corals and glass sponges with their concave sides directed towards the current made up the unexpected terrain.\n\nGiant Shark Tooth Found Deep in the Ocean May Be Millions of Years Old\n\nTalk about chompers.

Living on Earth’s Jenni Doering called up Merry Camhi, director of the New York Seascape at the Wildlife Conservation Society and New York Aquarium to learn more about what protecting Hudson Canyon could mean.\n\nGuest post: Why ocean depth is key for how warming will affect marine life\n\nThe world’s oceans are home to more than 240,000 known species, each with specific conditions in which they need to thrive. However, human-caused climate change is altering the marine environment through changes in temperature, oxygen content and acidity levels, threatening the habitats of these species.\n\nThis new underwater camera is powered by sound\n\nWhat if you could photograph the deepest depths of the sea using a camera powered only by the ocean's soundscape? That's the end goal of a new prototype device developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) — a wireless, battery-free underwater camera that runs on sound waves.\n\nIn the ocean’s twilight zone, a fish that could feed the world – or destroy it\n\nLanternfish, the Earth’s most abundant vertebrates, may be the ultimate food source. But will catching them ruin the climate?\n\nThis ship tried to warn the Titanic about the iceberg. Now scientists have found its wreckage\n\nThe wreck of a ship that tried to warn the RMS Titanic of the iceberg that sank it on its maiden voyage has been found at the bottom of the Irish Sea. The British merchant steamship SS Mesaba sent a warning radio message to the Titanic on April 15, 1912 while crossing the Atlantic. The message was received by the Titanic -- which was advertised as unsinkable -- but did not reach the main control center of the vessel.\n\nExploring MBARI and the Tech Behind Deep Sea Videos\n\nWe here at Nerdist love watching videos about the ocean. Especially when there’s critters in them that we never even knew existed. Like the barreleye fish and its translucent head. Or the carnivorous harp sponge. Whether you want to learn or just vibe out to deep sea videos, there’s an amazing collection on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI) YouTube channel. Scientists have described more than 240 new species based on footage and collections by MBARI. Jordan Peele even used some of them as inspiration while designing aliens for his film Nope. So we jumped at the chance to visit MBARI and see just how much science, technology, and manpower is behind those wonderful deep sea videos.\n\nThe centuries-long quest to map the seafloor’s hidden secrets\n\nOcean explorers have long tried to survey the contours of the seafloor, but today's charts still pale in comparison to those of distant planets.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the crustacean with eyes for a head\n\nShrimp-like Cystisoma are protected from predators by being virtually invisible – thanks to unique retina and a body that casts almost no shadow.\n\nWho Owns the Ocean’s Genes? Tension on the High Seas\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of recent United Nations negotiations in New York City, countries from around the world failed to finalize an ambitious treaty that would create enormous marine protected areas and enforce stricter rules for industry on the high seas—the two thirds of the ocean beyond any country’s exclusive ocean territory. The deal faltered in the final hours, mainly over an issue that has long dogged international ocean talks: how to share profits from commercializing the high seas’ genetic resources.\n\nFact check: NASA continues to explore ocean, did not stop in 1978\n\nSome social media users are sharing a YouTube video that claims NASA halted ocean exploration efforts in 1978.\n\nHow marine predators find food hot spots in open ocean 'deserts'\n\nA new study finds that marine predators, such as tunas, billfishes and sharks, aggregate in anticyclonic, clockwise-rotating ocean eddies (mobile, coherent bodies of water). As these anticyclonic eddies move throughout the open ocean, the study suggests that the predators are also moving with them, foraging on the high deep-ocean biomass contained within.\n\nAn intense marine heat wave is setting ocean temperature records in the North Atlantic\n\nAs climate change causes the pace of warming to accelerate, scientists are concerned about the potential consequences for marine ecosystems, sea-level rise and extreme weather.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the ‘Elvis worms’ that sparkle in the darkness\n\nNearly 4,000 metres (13,000 feet) underwater in the Pescadero basin in the Gulf of California lie some of the Pacific’s deepest hydrothermal vents – and they’re covered in small iridescent worms. “You’ll see little pink sparkly worms, blue ones, red ones, black ones and white ones,” says Avery Hiley, a graduate researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.\n\nWhat is this thing? ‘Blue goo’ found on floor of Caribbean Sea stumps NOAA explorers\n\nAn alien-looking “goo” creature is growing on the floor of the Caribbean Sea and it bears more than a slight resemblance to the shapeless 1950s science fiction monster The Blob. Scientists with NOAA Ocean Exploration made the discovery, but were at a loss as to what to call it — or even what category of life it fits into.\n\nNOAA seeks new members for Ocean Exploration Advisory Board, welcomes others\n\nNOAA is seeking up to two new members for its Ocean Exploration Advisory Board, a federal advisory committee that advises the NOAA administrator on matters pertaining to ocean exploration. The panel advises NOAA on strategic planning, exploration priorities, competitive ocean exploration grant programs and other matters as requested.\n\nHow my exploration of the Titanic led to a realization about the future of spaceflight\n\nIn July, I took part as a scientist in a commercial deep sea company’s amazing dive to explore the wreckage of the RMS Titanic, over 12,000 feet beneath the North Atlantic. Next year, I am scheduled to fly to space aboard commercial space company Virgin Galactic to conduct a suborbital research mission for NASA. Both of these activities are examples of modern-day exploration using high tech vehicles that didn’t exist until recent years.\n\nNever-before-seen details of Titanic shipwreck revealed with new 8K video\n\nNearly 40 years after the discovery of the RMS Titanic shipwreck, newly released video is providing new details about the ship that sunk over a century ago.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the incredible fish with a transparent head\n\nIn the ocean’s shadowy twilight zone, between 600 and 800 metres beneath the surface, there are fish that gaze upwards through their transparent heads with eyes like mesmerising emerald orbs. These domes are huge spherical lenses that sit on a pair of long, silvery eye tubes – hence its common name, the barreleye fish (Macropinna microstoma).\n\nThere's a 'Lost City' Deep in The Ocean, And It's a Place Unlike Anywhere Else\n\nClose to the summit of an underwater mountain west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a jagged landscape of towers rises from the gloom. Their creamy carbonate walls and columns appear ghostly blue in the light of a remotely operated vehicle sent to explore.\n\nSearching The Ocean's Depths For Future Medicines\n\nWe are headed to the deep sea today, off the west coast of Ireland.

It's a world of the unknown, but in some tropical and subtropical waters coral reefs thrive. Very few scientists have ventured to these deep reefs, known technically as mesophotic coral ecosystems, meaning \"middle light,\" and many assumed that the lack of light and chilly temperatures meant few species could exist there.\n\nDiscovered in the deep: the worm that eats bones\n\nThe deep sea is home to a group of animals that look like tiny plants. They have no mouths, no stomachs and no anuses. They live inside a tube with a feathery red plume sticking out of one end and a clump of roots at the other.\n\nUncrewed Saildrone to Explore Remote Alaskan Waters\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the Saildrone Surveyor departed Dutch Harbor in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, embarking on a multipartner project to better understand the ocean and seafloor in one of the most remote and understudied parts of the United States. NOAA Ocean Exploration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) are the primary sponsors of this work.\n\nSurprise Discovery: Sleeping Giant Could End Deep Ocean Life\n\nA previously overlooked factor — the position of continents — helps fill Earth’s oceans with life-supporting oxygen.

Whatever the cause of their increased size, whether the colder temperatures, the reduced pressures of predation or the increased scarcity of food in the ocean depths, animals such as crustaceans and cephalopods simply become bigger the deeper that they swim.\n\nNew model sheds light on day/night cycle in the global ocean\n\nPhytoplankton is the foundation of all life on the planet. Understanding how these photosynthetic organisms react to their ocean environment is important to understanding the rest of the food web.\n\nThis Shaggy Deep-Sea Creature Looks Like an Undulating Wad of Orange Spaghetti\n\nA bizarre seafloor creature covered with luminous orange, spaghetti-like tentacles recently made its internet debut in newly released video footage. The unusual pom-pom-shaped creature is actually a type of segmented marine worm known as a polychaete, and it belongs to an appropriately named group: spaghetti worms.\n\nExploration Is Fundamental to Human Success\n\nSchoolbooks typically present explorers as intrepid individuals who, at the behest of colonizing leaders, sail wooden ships to new lands, ride on horseback across uncharted mountains or slash their way through the jungle. But today most explorers who are making fundamental discoveries are scientists. And whether the frontiers are minuscule, like the human genome, or massive, like our deepest oceans, we still have much left to learn about planet Earth. The quests that modern scientists pursue rival anything in a history book or an adventure novel.\n\nHope for New Drugs Arises from the Sea\n\nAfter completing six long rounds of chemotherapy, 75-year-old Pedro R. L. received the news he and his family had been hoping for: his chronic lymphocytic leukemia was in complete remission. But while his body was still recovering, he contracted COVID-19. He was admitted to the Quirónsalud Madrid University Hospital on January 30, 2021. Initial treatments failed, and by February 25 he had developed severe pneumonia. That's when his doctor, Pablo Guisado, recommended they try plitidepsin, a potent antiviral compound in a phase 3 clinical trial for treating hospitalized COVID patients.\n\n‘They look almost human made.’ NOAA finds weird lines of holes in Mid-Atlantic floor\n\nScientists exploring a submerged mountain range in the Mid-Atlantic stumbled onto something they can’t explain: An organized series of holes punched in the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nScientists find 30 potential new species at bottom of ocean\n\nResearchers from the UK’s Natural History Museum used a remotely operated vehicle to collect specimens from the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the central Pacific.
