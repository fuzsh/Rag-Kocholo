        "text": "Bacteria are smart organisms that create drug resistance by decreasing the effect of antibiotics in different ways, such as secretion of the Î²-lactamase enzymes. Finding the compounds that can act as the inhibitors of these enzymes is a great help in reducing drug resistance and treat all types of infections. In this study, using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques, we introduced two Relebactam substructures as new inhibitors of class A Î²-lactamase enzymes. Results of molecular docking show that the conformation of these two compounds in the active site of class A Î²-lactamase enzymes has a good match with Relebactam and their binding affinity to enzymes is equal to or better than Relebactam. Results showed a good tendency for binding and the formation of van der Waals and hydrogen interactions between the desired compounds and the Î²-lactamase enzymes. The results of the analysis of the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories showed that in the presence of the desired compounds, the second structures of the enzymes did not undergo many changes and in none of the systems, the binding of the compounds to the enzyme did not cause much instability, and in most cases made the structure stable. The hydrogen bonds were stable during the simulation time and in most cases, the new compounds formed more hydrogen bonds and had better binding affinity than Relebactam confirms the docking results. The results of this study can be helpful in designing new beta-lactamase inhibitors and new treatment methods to deal with drug resistance.\n\nCommunicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma"
