Certain contours of that future are already clear. Canada will be committed to do its part in the global effort to finally confront climate change and environmental degradation. Our economy will have to discover innovative ways to sustain its competitiveness as data and information become the key factors of production and as the superpower rivalry between the U.S. and China creates new challenges and opportunities for Canada's traditional trade and investment relationships. Health care will need to embrace an expanding array of innovative treatments and technologies while coping with a chronic fiscal challenge in the face of an aging population. These developments will be occurring in a social and political context that has finally begun to acknowledge and address long-standing inequities in the distribution of opportunities and burdens among groups in Canadian society, notably Indigenous peoples and racial minorities.\n\nEach of the foregoing issues is systemic in scale and scope. Each will therefore require innovative responses that integrate across disciplines and competencies and that situate technological solutions, more than ever, in their social and cultural context. To that end, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) invited an informal working group of some 40 thought-leaders to identify potential developments over the next 10 to 15 years that would be significant for Canada. It is emphasized that this report is advisory to the NRC and represents the perspectives of the Working Group alone and not of the NRC or of the Government of Canada.\n\nThis report is a collaborative product of that Working Group. It is a horizon scan focused on the 2030-35 time period that seeks to frame strategic thinking at a relatively high level but with enough detail to convey a sense of realism. The horizon scan was structured under six broad subject areas:\n\nClimate Change\n\nResource Futures\n\nBig Data and Artificial Intelligence\n\nCybersecurity and Privacy\n\nHealth-care Futures\n\nNew Models of Innovation\n\nFor each subject area, the view of the \"horizon\" in 2030-35 is described under two or three over-arching \"Statements\" created to organize and summarize the input and discussions of the Working Group. Each Statement is illustrated with two or three specific examples drawn from ideas submitted by Working Group members.\n\nThe Statements are not intended as hard and fast predictions. Neither do they purport to encompass all relevant aspects of the six subject areas. The Statements are informed views of the principal contours of what might be called the \"space of challenge and opportunity\" facing Canada in approximately 10 to 15 years. The emphasis is on the science & technology aspects but complemented with the relevant social and economic context.\n\nFive common themes, summarized in the final chapter of the report, cut across the broad subject areas:\n\nCompetitiveness\n\nData as a strategic resource\n\nSustainability and resilience\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion\n\nThe Working Group's perspectives on 2030-35 paint a portrait of a successful society in which technology is developed in the service of human goals with the benefits equitably shared. The viewpoint is justifiably optimistic in view of Canada's extraordinary gifts and capabilities but also acknowledges that significant challenges will need to be overcome. Technology will play a vital role, enabling Canadians to meet the challenges and embrace the opportunities, guided by human purpose.\n\nCompilation of Statements\n\nThe Statements should be read as reflecting the imagined situation in 2030-35, i.e., from a future perspective. Neither the Statements nor the illustrative examples are listed in any intended order of priority.\n\n1.

Canadian digital platform co-ops increase and flourish in sectors beyond traditional \"sharing economy\" businesses.\n\n6.3(b). Interdisciplinary creative hubs in neighbourhoods across Canada foster a new sense of purpose and creative entrepreneurialism among citizens.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEventually the COVID-19 pandemic will be resolved, economies will recover, and Canada's attention will refocus on the future. Certain contours of that future are already clear. Canada will be committed to do its part in the global effort to finally confront climate change and environmental degradation. Our economy will have to discover innovative ways to sustain its competitiveness as data and information become the key factors of production and as the superpower rivalry between the U.S. and China creates new challenges and opportunities for Canada's traditional trade and investment relationships. Health care will need to embrace an expanding array of innovative treatments and technologies while coping with a chronic fiscal challenge in the face of an aging population. These developments will be occurring in a social and political context that has finally begun to acknowledge and address long-standing inequities in the distribution of opportunities and burdens among groups in Canadian society, notably Indigenous peoples and racial minorities.\n\nEach of the foregoing issues is systemic in scale and scope. Each will therefore require innovative responses that integrate across disciplines and competencies and that situate technological solutions, more than ever, in their social and cultural context. Achieving this broader perspective will be a challenge for every organization, public and private. To that end, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) invited an informal working group of some 40 thought-leaders to identify potential developments over the next 10 to 15 years that would be significant for Canada.\n\nThis document is the report of that Working Group.Footnote 1 It is a horizon scan focused on the 2030-35 time period that seeks to frame strategic thinking at a relatively high level but with enough detail to convey a sense of realism. The Working Group did not engage in scenario creation or technology forecasting but rather sought to provide informed views of what might be called the \"space of challenge and opportunity\" facing Canada in approximately 10 to 15 years.\n\nThe horizon scan described here completes the first phase of a two-phase initiative. It will inform a second phase of focused consultations organized by the NRC and intended to help identify the science, technologies, skills, and other capabilities that will enable Canada to succeed and prosper in the mid-term.\n\nIt is emphasized that this report represents the perspectives of the members of the Working Group alone and not of the NRC or of the Government of Canada.\n\nThe horizon scan was structured under six broad subject areas:\n\nClimate Change\n\nResource Futures\n\nBig Data and Artificial Intelligence\n\nCybersecurity and Privacy\n\nHealth-care Futures\n\nNew Models of Innovation\n\nHorizon Scanning Methodology\n\nThe methodology employed is a variation of a horizon scanning approach developed by Professor William Sutherland at the University of Cambridge (U.K.). In the present version, the Working Group was divided into six Subgroups consisting of six to seven members and corresponding to the foregoing subjects (see Annex I).\n\nEach Subgroup member was asked to develop two to three statements, together with a brief (100-200 word) rationale, that describe developments of potential significance for Canada that might plausibly be realized over the next 10-15 years but were unlikely to be already very familiar outside the relevant expert communities. The developments were not restricted to specific aspects of science and technology (S&T) but could also refer to the social and economic context in which prospective S&T developments would be embedded.\n\nWithin a Subgroup, each individual member submitted statements to the NRC secretariat for the project.Footnote 2 The full set of anonymized statements (typically numbering about 15) was then circulated to all Subgroup members who scored the statements with respect to potential importance for Canada as well as likelihood within the 2030-35 timeframe.Footnote 3\n\nDuring October and November 2020, each Subgroup met once virtually for a half-day discussion of the set of statements and ranking results. Those conversations ranged broadly over specific technologies identified in the statements, but they tended to focus primarily on contextual issues—for example, competitiveness, inclusiveness, resilience, the prominence of data, and related matters of trust.\n\nFollowing the discussions, the secretariat prepared short papers for each of the six Subgroup subject areas. These papers—which ultimately became the following chapters of this report—were based on the statements originally prepared by Subgroup members, interpreted and amended as necessary in light of the Subgroup discussions, bolstered with further supporting evidence, and structured under a small number of over-arching statements together with illustrative examples. The draft chapters were reviewed offline by the relevant Subgroups, amended, and compiled into a single document that was shared with the full Working Group prior to a plenary meeting on March 5, 2021. That meeting provided an opportunity for all members to comment on the output of other Subgroups and to identify a number of cross-cutting themes that are summarized in the concluding chapter of this report. A complete draft was shared with the Working Group for any final comments.\n\nDisclaimer: This report is a collaborative product of the Working Group prepared with the assistance of the secretariat. It is not intended to be a formal consensus document although it has benefitted from, and reflects, the input and critique of all Working Group members. Nevertheless, not every member of the Working Group would necessarily agree with every statement or with the choice of emphasis. A spectrum of views regarding the future is both inevitable and proper.\n\nNote on Interpretation\n\nEach of the following six chapters begins with a presentation of the broad context. The view of the \"horizon\" in 2030-35 is then described under two or three over-arching \"Statements\" created to organize and summarize the input of the Subgroup and full Working Group. For example, the first Statement under Climate Change is:\n\nCanada makes progress towards carbon-neutral energy production, but important technological, economic, and political challenges remain.\n\nThe Statements should be read as reflecting the imagined situation in 2030-35, i.e., from a future perspective. Each of the over-arching Statements is illustrated with two or three specific examples drawn from the ideas that were originally submitted by Working Group members. For example, the foregoing Statement in the Climate Change chapter is illustrated with two examples:\n\nClean, renewable energy and broad application of carbon capture, utilization, and storage are cornerstones of Canada's climate strategy.\n\nImproved efficiency in energy storage facilitates greater adoption of wind and solar.\n\nAll told, the report contains 17 over-arching Statements and 41 illustrative examples elaborated with supporting text and evidence.Footnote 4 The following considerations need to be born in mind when interpreting the Statements and examples.\n\nThe Statements should not be read as hard and fast predictions. They are informed views of the principal contours of what might be called the \"space of challenge and opportunity\" facing Canada in approximately 10 to 15 years. The emphasis is on the S&T aspects but complemented with the relevant social and economic context. The objective was not to write the last word but rather to stimulate thinking about a future that is necessarily uncertain.\n\nThe Statements are to some extent aspirational although the Working Group believes they are achievable by 2030-35 with sufficient commitment from the public and private sectors and from individuals. While new public policies may be required to achieve aspects of the envisioned future, this document should not be read as specific policy advocacy.\n\nGiven the great breadth of each of the six subject areas, it was not possible for the Working Group to cover all relevant aspects. The over-arching Statements attempt to capture what were thought likely to be the most salient features. But gaps will inevitably remain.\n\nThe examples are intended to illustrate the over-arching Statements through specific S&T or social and economic developments. Obviously these are not the only possible illustrations. They are drawn from the ideas submitted originally by Working Group members and have been constrained by that process.\n\nNeither the Statements nor the illustrative examples are listed in any intended order of priority.\n\nFollowing the next six chapters, the report concludes with observations on themes that were common across several of the subject areas.\n\n1. Climate Change\n\nThe Context\n\nThe UN forecasts that, without action to dramatically cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the world is on course to warm 3.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, well beyond the Paris Agreement target of between 1.5 and 2.0°C. Without action, average Canadian temperatures are projected to increase by between 1.8 and 6.3°C by the end of the century, with much higher levels in the far north. The global effects of climate change are already being felt in the oceans and on every continent—extreme weather events, sea level rise, permafrost thawing, inland flooding, desertification, wildfires, infestations of invasive species, and a host of other more subtle factors, many of which we have likely not yet identified.\n\nThe largest impacts are impossible to accurately quantify—for example, mass migration of displaced people as a result of extensive reduction of habitable land, particularly in Africa and Asia and low-lying coastal areas everywhere. While sea level rose by about 19 cm in the 20th century, it is expected to rise by at least twice that much in the 21st. A billion people around the world now live no more than 10 metres above sea level and are thus greatly at risk from inundating storm surges as the sea level rises and storms intensify. Some forecasts predict more than a billion \"climate refugees\" by 2050. Such migration would test the limits of national and global governance as well as international cooperation.\n\nOver the next 15 years, significant investment worldwide will be required to adapt to damage resulting from climate change. Even though a certain amount of temperature increase is now inevitable due to the global failure so far to mitigate GHG emissions, we must act immediately to keep the situation from getting even worse. That's why the global campaign to reduce, and then eliminate, net GHG emissions is essential.\n\nCanada will have to do its part. This country produces only about 1.6% of global GHGs but, along with Australia and the U.S., is among the top three per capita emitters among OECD countries. Canada's emissions in 2018 were 729 megatons (Mt), essentially the same as in 2005 and more than three times the global per capita average. More positively, Canada's per capita emissions have declined by more than 13% since 2005 and, per dollar of (real) GDP, emissions have fallen by more than 21%. Although the GHG intensity of the economy has continued to improve, absolute emissions—which are what really determine global warming—have remained stubbornly high and failed to come close to the reduction targets set over the past 24 years since the Kyoto Accord (Figure 1.1).\n\nTo address this problem, Canada—and the world—must radically transform the energy system. However, the world is still dependent on fossil fuels for more than 80% of primary energy. Canada, with its vast resources of oil and gas, will almost inevitably continue to use and export fossil fuels over at least the next 15 years (Table 1.1). Different technological approaches to achieving deep emissions reduction are being taken around the world. What is common is that countries are attempting to take carbon out of the energy mix—through use of non-carbon sources like wind and solar or by capturing carbon before it enters the atmosphere—while greatly increasing the role of electricity in domestic energy supply systems. This requires vast new investments of money and effort to meet the technological, financial, regulatory, political, and behavioural challenges that arise during such a massive transition.\n\nFigure 1.1.

The Canadian government is committed to more than a 30% reduction in GHGs by 2030 on the path to net-zero in 2050. To that end, in December 2020 the government released a Climate Plan built around a carbon tax increase from $50/tonne of CO2 in 2022 to $170/tonne by 2030, along with regulations for the Clean Fuel Standard and $15 billion in incentives for energy efficiency and new technologies. This was followed by a Hydrogen Strategy, featuring a $1.5 billion investment in a Low-carbon and Zero-emissions Fuels Fund, and a Small Modular Reactor Action Plan (the latter without a specified investment commitment).\n\nTable 1.1. Canada's Production of Primary Energy Energy source Total energy amount, 2012 (%) Total energy amount, 2018 (%) Crude oil 42.9 48.7 Natural gas 34.9 33.3 Primary electricity 9.9 8.5 Coal 8.6 5.4 Gas plant natural gas liquids 3.6 4.0 Total energy (petajoules)Footnote * 17,335 21,603\n\nSources: The Daily - Energy Supply and Demand, 2018; The Daily - Energy Supply and Demand, 2012. 2018 is the most recent year for which data is available.\n\nFor the objectives of the new Climate Plan to be achieved, significant investments will need to be put in place in a short period of time relative to the scale of the transformation required. Canada has done a good job on non-emitting electricity thanks to hydro power and nuclear capacity combined with a program to phase out coal. However, Table 1.1 shows that Canada's primary energy supply is still very heavily weighted to oil and gas: 82% of the total in 2018, an increase from 78% in 2012. Some can be replaced by further hydro development, nuclear, and bioenergy, but massive non-carbon electrification will require a variety of technologies including increased use of wind and solar, natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS),Footnote 5 geothermal, and possibly others.\n\nBecause of the intermittent supply of wind and solar, there is a need both for enormous energy storage capacity and for flexible means of electrical generation to smooth and complement variable supplies. Given Canada's rich resources of natural gas and the need to minimize GHGs emitted during extraction of oil for as long as it continues to be produced, the deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies will be essential.\n\nLooking forward, advances in information technology will have an impact on smart grid development. And, more speculatively, quantum computing may eventually enable innovative ways to reduce GHG emissions through design of new catalysts useful in carbon capture, energy production and storage, fertilizers, and cement and other materials whose production currently emits significant GHGs.\n\nPerspectives on the Future\n\nDrawing on the foregoing context, the ideas developed and discussed by the Subgroup can be encapsulated in the following three Statements that identify key features of Canada's response to climate change from the perspective of 2030-35:\n\n1.1 Canada makes progress towards carbon-neutral energy production, but important technological, economic, and political challenges remain.\n\n1.2 Canada embraces electrification of road transportation on the path to eliminating approximately 150 Mt of GHG emissions before 2050.\n\n1.3 Decisions in Canada on climate change mitigation and adaptation earn social trust through alignment and co-development with affected communities.\n\nSeveral of the specific ideas originally submitted by Subgroup members are featured under each of the foregoing Statements to provide concrete illustrations of the broader theme. These Statements and illustrative examples are not intended to be hard and fast predictions or to present a comprehensive picture of Canada's climate change future. Rather, they comprise a number of informed perspectives on potential developments that Subgroup members believe will be important for Canada. Moreover, the Statements are to some extent aspirational, although the Subgroup believes they are achievable with sufficient commitment from the public and private sectors and from individuals.\n\n1.1 Canada makes progress towards carbon-neutral energy production, but important technological, economic, and political challenges remain.\n\nOver the next 10-15 years, Canada will need to make significant progress towards substantially reducing energy sources that generate carbon dioxide, either by substituting carbon-free forms or by capturing CO2 from, or before it enters, the atmosphere. The scale of the challenge is illustrated by the fact that the production of oil and gas and the dominant use of petroleum products in transportation generated more than half of Canada's GHG emissions in 2018 (Table 1.2), and thus were the focus of the Subgroup's submissions. But other significant GHG-emitting sectors, such as buildings, heavy industry, and agriculture—which together comprise a third of Canada's emissions—all require situation-specific technologies and approaches if Canada's net-zero objective is to be achieved. The economic transformation required will generate tremendous opportunities over the next decades for new green industries and innovative clean tech companies.\n\nTable 1.2. Canada's GHG Emissions by Sector Sector Megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (2005) Megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (2018) % Change 2005-18 Oil and gas 157.6 193.2 + 23% Transportation 160.7 185.9 + 16% Buildings 86.2 92.5 + 7% Electricity 119.3 64.3 - 46% Heavy industry 87.4 78.3 - 10% Agriculture 72.1 73.1 + 1% Waste & others 46.3 42.2 - 9% Total 729.6 729.5\n\nSource: Canada's Official Greenhouse Gas Inventory. 2018 is the most recent year for which data is available.\n\nMeeting the country's ambitious reduction targets in a relatively short time means that R&D alone cannot be relied on to do the heavy lifting.Footnote 6 Instead, the challenge is to improve and further deploy those technologies that are already relatively mature—the \"safe bets\" that we know will be employed on the path to net-zero. A very significant increase of solar and wind can be expected in Canada's energy mix by 2035. But this will need to be complemented with other clean sources, both to meet rapidly growing electricity demand and to smooth the intermittency of wind and solar. Several technologies will play a role depending on how they develop economically and in specific circumstances, e.g., new sources of hydro, nuclear (particularly the new design of small modular reactors or SMRs), and hydrogen.\n\nHow to interpret the illustrative examples.\n\nThe specific developments that appear throughout this document to illustrate the broader Statements are based on examples provided by members of the various Subgroups. It is important to bear in mind that the technologies and approaches described in these illustrations will usually also be applicable in other situations that may not be described in depth or explicitly mentioned.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n1.1(a). Clean, renewable energy and broad application of carbon capture, utilization, and storage are cornerstones of Canada's climate strategy.\n\nLooking forward to 2035, wind and solar are expected to be the primary component of electrical energy supply growth in Canada while advances in storage during times of surplus generation would contribute to enhanced reliability (see 1.1(b) below). Baseload capacity would still need to be provided by some combination of hydro, natural gas, and nuclear. According to the \"Evolving Scenario\" in Canada's Energy Futures 2020, Canada's overall electricity generating capacity is estimated to grow by 28% between 2018 and 2035, with wind and solar accounting for 62% of that increase (Figure 1.2). However, despite this rapid growth, by 2035 wind and solar would only constitute 22% of total capacity (according to the scenario) because these clean renewables are starting from today's very low base. The remaining 78% of generating capacity in 2035 would be contributed by hydro (48% of the total), nuclear (6%), biofuels (2%), and fossil fuels (22%). In this scenario, coal and oil generation would decrease sharply over the next 15 years while natural gas would increase as a proportion of generating capacity from 15% in 2018 to more than 21% by 2035. This scenario is not a forecast, but it is an informed view from Canada's Energy Regulator and highlights the importance of encouraging even greater development of wind and solar while implementing CCUS technologies to sharply mitigate emissions from natural gas generation of electricity (see chapter on Resource Futures).\n\nFigure 1.2 Canada's Electricity Generating Capacity, 2010-35\n\nFigure 1.2 - Text version\n\nSolar Wind Other 2010 281 3,746 127,731 2015 2,135 10,946 131,301 2020 3,028 13,901 128,330 2025 4,697 16,976 129,286 2030 7,193 23,554 139,736 2035 11,401 29,369 147,817\n\nSource: Canada Energy Regulator.\n\nDespite progress in decarbonizing the electricity grid in Canada, some sectors, including transportation and oil and gas production (particularly from the oil sands), have proven difficult to decarbonize. Because reliance on fossil fuels can only be reduced relatively gradually, capture of carbon emissions from these sources will be needed to meet Canada's 2030 and 2050 climate targets. And the economic necessity of doing so will increase as the imposed \"cost of carbon\" continues to rise to $170/tonne by 2030. CCUS is the only group of technologies that helps both to lower emissions in these sectors directly and to remove CO2 from the air to balance those emissions that are extremely difficult to avoid.\n\n1.1(b). Improved efficiency in energy storage facilitates greater adoption of wind and solar.\n\nThe cost of electricity generation from wind, and particularly solar, has declined steadily to the point where these clean renewable sources are often the least cost for new generation capacity. However, increasing their share of Canada's energy mix requires better management of intermittent supply along with further improvements in the performance of large-scale power storage technologies.\n\nBattery storage is the most common large-scale option today, mostly due to the ubiquity of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and their increasing energy density (i.e., the amount of energy that can be stored per unit of weight). Over the past 10 years, Li-ion energy densities have almost tripled, paving the way for longer-range electric vehicles coming to market. Quebec is already a leader in energy storage, with Hydro-Québec poised to launch EVLO, a new business unit that will design, sell, and operate battery-based energy storage equipment, with a focus on Li-ion technology. Due to the technology's mature state, abundant supplies of lithium, and current deployment at scale both in Canada and globally, continued improvement and expanded use of these batteries would be Canada's best bet for very large-scale storage over the next 10-15 years.\n\nDespite the dominance of Li-ion batteries, other technologies will be superior in some specific situations. Storage options include mechanical systems such as compressed air and flywheel energy storage systems; pumped storage systems; and passive energy storage where energy is stored in the same form (e.g., passive heating, cooling) as it will be used. Hydrogen may eventually be an economic storage medium in many circumstances—whether generated on site via electrolysis from carbon-free electricity (hydropower, wind, solar or nuclear), or via natural gas (with CCS) and stored for peaking needs or to fill gaps when renewables are down.Footnote 7 Hydrogen has the further important advantage that it can be transported, most readily in liquid form to minimize volume. As with many energy system challenges, successfully integrating a number of solutions may generate the biggest payoffs.\n\n1.2. Canada embraces electrification of road transportation on the path to eliminating approximately 150 Mt of GHG emissions before 2050.\n\nThe road transportation sector is a key target in Canada's new Climate Plan. It accounted in 2018 for 154 Mt of GHG emissions or 21% of Canada's total, up from 18% in 2005. The growth in emissions from half-ton trucks and SUVs over the last 15 years has nullified the progress made in reducing the emissions of cars.\n\nThe electrification of road transport—other than heavy freight hauling—is now an established global trend. In 2019, 2.6% of new vehicle sales globally were electric, a 40% year-on-year increase. Norway's fleet of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) is the highest per capita; more than 40% of all cars sold in 2019 were electric. Canada is not yet among the leaders. In 2019, only 133,840 EVs were sold, constituting 2.7% of new vehicle sales, about equal to the global average. Canada's target is for EVs to reach 30% of new passenger vehicle sales by 2030 and 100% by 2040. Quebec has set a more ambitious target of 100% by 2035, similar to California.\n\nMeeting these targets is of course much easier said than done. Fortunately most of the world's major vehicle manufacturers have committed to substantial, or total, electrification of new models in the 2030-40 timeframe, albeit with slightly hedged bets. Their marketing strategies should be effective in bringing the public along, although this will require complementary public policies to encourage gas to electric switching; clean electricity generation; ubiquitous charging infrastructure; and power grid upgrades. Co-ordination may be the much bigger challenge than technology, per se.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n1.2(a). Parked electric vehicles store energy in their batteries and deliver it back to the \"smart grid\" as needed while the owner is paid by the utility.\n\nElectric utilities are moving to massive Li-ion battery installations for energy storage to deliver energy from intermittent sources, such as wind and solar, as needed. A huge number of Li-ion batteries in EVs, which are parked, on average, for more than 80% of the day, should also be used for energy storage. The \"smart grid\" and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communication, which are at various stages of development and implementation around the world, could enable seamless use of vehicles for storing energy. Vehicle owners would provide a \"schedule\" of when their vehicles are tethered to the grid and the minimum amount of energy to be left in the battery to support the next drive. All this could be accomplished using software. In addition, modern Li-ion cells could support 10,000 charge-discharge cycles, which is much more than any vehicle would need for driving alone.\n\nLion Electric in Quebec is planning to install V2G technology in all its electric school buses. Its projects in California and New York have already demonstrated the feasibility of V2G for school districts and utilities. However, scaling up these efforts within the next 15 years depends on achieving a critical mass of EVs on the road; customer buy-in; and investment by utilities that may nevertheless be reluctant in the face of cost challenges. Several factors suggest that EV sales in Canada will grow very rapidly: as noted above, all of the major car makers have made EV production the core of their future; cost and performance (particularly range) will continue to improve; and the rising carbon price will be a further incentive, as will federal and provincial regulations and subsidies.\n\n1.2(b). Battery and hydrogen fuel-cell technologies enable electrification of the various modes of road transportation.\n\nNote on other applications: Although this example specifically addresses electric buses, the technologies are also relevant to the electrification of other modes of transportation, particularly cars and certain types of trucks where the potential for emissions reduction is larger.\n\nThe appropriate technology for vehicle electrification depends on the purpose. While Li-ion batteries are well-suited for cars and light trucks, their weight makes them less suitable to provide the power required for heavy freight haulage. Hydrogen fuel cells could be a zero-emissions alternative. Urban buses are an intermediate case where both battery and fuel-cell electrification are viable.\n\nGlobally, battery electric buses and hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses are gaining momentum due to their ability to reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality. More than 425,000 electric buses are on the road worldwide, with the majority in China. By 2040 two-thirds of all buses are expected to be powered by batteries although fuel cells could also become a significant part of the mix.\n\nCanada could benefit more from transit electrification than many other countries given its relatively low-carbon provincial electricity grids: about 80% of electricity generation in Canada is non-emitting. Nevertheless, despite Canada's manufacturing capacity in electric buses—represented by GreenPower Motor Company, The Lion Electric Company, New Flyer Industries, and Nova Bus—and Ballard's world-class capability in vehicle fuel-cell engineering, very few Canadian-made electric buses are on the roads today. Toronto, with 60 electric buses, has North America's largest fleet and plans to be fully electrified by 2040. Many other Canadian municipalities have announced short- to mid-term electrification plans, and several transit agencies are adopting electric buses. A recent EKOS poll indicated that 80% of Canadians support a $1.5 billion federal investment to help municipalities put 5,000 electric school and transit buses on Canadian roads by 2025.\n\nElectric buses provide an opportunity for fulfilling a jobs-rich manufacturing mandate while addressing climate change. The biggest challenge is cost: a battery-powered bus currently costs roughly double a diesel bus. Bloomberg, however, expects that e-buses will achieve approximate price parity by 2030, mainly due to the decreasing cost of batteries. Once purchased, electric buses are cheaper to run and require fewer repairs, but governments and transit agencies first need to invest in charging stations. Fortunately, the limited range of a battery vehicle is not a significant concern for urban electric buses since routes are relatively short and re-charging can be centralized in a small number of locations. The recent $1.5 billion investment in electric buses announced in the Canada Infrastructure Bank Growth Plan also includes charging infrastructure. And the Canadian Urban Transit Research and Innovation Consortium (CUTRIC)Footnote 8 is investing almost $1 million in the development of a cheaper electric bus charging system. CUTRIC is also developing North America's first centralized and cyber-secured data trust, which enables real-time sharing of data on e-bus performance, charging patterns, energy and electricity loads, and energy intensity.\n\n1.3. Decisions in Canada on climate change mitigation and adaptation earn social trust through alignment and co-development with affected communities.\n\nPolicy tools such as carbon pricing, regulation, and financial incentives are necessary to make Canadian behaviour more climate friendly, but they are not sufficient. Traditionally marginalized communities and groups such as remote and Indigenous communities, and those whose livelihoods are \"carbon-intensive\", will be understandably skeptical that their welfare will be a front and centre consideration when policy decisions are being made. Governments must therefore build trust to earn the necessary public support for the far-reaching changes that are needed. There is no guarantee that this will be forthcoming.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n1.3(a). Robust Indigenous authority over infrastructure project decisions, together with (non-Indigenous) local community engagement expectations, transform business models, government decision making, and the timing and nature of responses to climate change.\n\nIndigenous governments and communities in Canada are pivotal decision-makers for infrastructure projects shaping both climate mitigation (e.g., electricity generation and transmission, hydrocarbon production and transport) and adaptation (e.g., building resilient infrastructure). Some say that the future of the oil and gas industry depends on its relations with Indigenous peoples and governments. Moody's recently identified the failure to achieve social licence from Indigenous communities for natural resource projects as a factor that may downgrade the credit ratings of the implicated corporations.\n\nIndigenous ownership, equity partnerships, and Indigenous-led impact assessments are becoming the norm for projects on Indigenous territory. Many communities are clarifying the respective governance roles and responsibilities of hereditary and elected chiefs, thus potentially facilitating community involvement in projects. Federal/provincial policy authorities, regulators, and investors are starting to work in lockstep with Indigenous authorities in decision making.\n\nIn fact, local communities everywhere today expect and demand meaningful engagement in infrastructure project decisions that affect them. The world of elite centralized decision making is becoming a thing of the past. Indigenous and non-Indigenous community concerns for factors other than climate mitigation—such as local economic benefits, environmental impacts, climate adaptation, fairness, and transparency in decision-making—are often the key determinants of community support or opposition to individual projects and technologies. Successful climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives are those co-developed with communities to align with local interests, expectations, values, and world views.\n\nIn the specific case of Indigenous communities, developing robust processes for consensus building, both within those communities and between communities and governments, is essential. Strong political leadership must bring divergent interests together, resolving differences and building trust over the next 15 years. The challenge should not be underestimated. It will play out in the context of the implementation in Canada of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and evolving judicial and political interpretations of \"free, prior and informed consent\" of Indigenous rights holders. While the Supreme Court has not interpreted the Crown's duty to consult and accommodate as conferring a veto over energy or other major projects, it can be expected that Indigenous views and institutions will have greater legal and political weight in the future.\n\n1.3(b). Unstable citizen trust in institutions and intense political polarization challenge effective climate policy development and implementation.\n\nAnnual Edelman Trust Barometer results in 2017 suggest that \"trust is in crisis around the world\". In 2020 the trust gap between the \"informed\" and \"mass\" publics has grown to an all-time high, with distrust \"driven by a growing sense of inequity and unfairness in the system\". At the same time, group identity and extreme partisanship are driving political polarization. In this context, when people form their opinions on climate risk and risk mitigation (including technology options), they are apt to reason in a motivated fashion, selecting evidence that aligns with their world views, identities, and group affiliations. Evidence-based policy making suffers. These political and social dynamics challenge consensus building and the coherence and stability of climate change policy. In Canada, these factors are exacerbated by the significant regional differences in the impact of GHG reductions.\n\nLeadership from government, industry, community leaders, NGOs, and academics is necessary, but likely not sufficient. Providing more information about the need for climate action is also necessary, but not sufficient. There is a need to transform communication and engagement strategies to focus on building the trust and consensus needed to effectively address climate change in the long term. Inclusive, collaborative approaches that respond to peoples' needs and values will be required to achieve the durable behavioural changes necessary to avert the effects of climate change. The research field of climate change communication (e.g., Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Alberta Narratives Project) is still in its infancy but offers relevant advice. There is also a role for K-12 education to improve the scientific literacy of Canadian children and teach them how to analyze and judge information delivered by news and social media sources. Although the effects of basic education are felt only in the longer term, climate change is a long-term challenge that nevertheless must be confronted from this day forward.\n\n2. Resource futures\n\nThe Context\n\nVast geography has endowed Canada with an abundant supply of fresh water, arable land, forests, marine life, and energy and mineral resources. These continue to shape the country's economic, social, and political development. In 2019, the natural resource industries (minerals and metals, energy, and forest products) contributed, directly and indirectly, almost 17% of GDP, 10% of employment, and 45% of goods exports. In addition, the agri-food industry generates more than 3% of GDP, employs more than 550,000 people, and contributes about 10% of goods exports.\n\nWhile Canada's economy relies on a great deal more than raw natural resources, and is among the world's most sophisticated, resources can continue to be as much a part of the country's future as of its past. This potential derives not only from natural endowment but also from a deep base of skills and growing global demand as affluence spreads across the world. But success is not guaranteed. The traditional wealth generation model of Canada's resource-based industries is challenged by a warming world that must eliminate GHG emissions and by a more environmentally sensitive world that demands responsible resource extraction. Canada can only meet these challenges through innovation in products and processes and through respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples as partners in responsible resource development.\n\nThe most significant structural factors that will affect Canada's resource industries over the next 15 years are global demand, climate change (the focus of the previous chapter), the impact of digitalization, and economic competitiveness.\n\nGlobal demand—Growing affluence in emerging economies ensures that demand for Canada's agri-food products, metals and minerals, and forest products will continue to increase. At the same time, the prospect of long-term falling demand for oil and gas, due to measures to eliminate GHG emissions and to electrify transport, leaves significant parts of the Canadian economy vulnerable. The forestry sector, which historically has relied on pulp and paper and lumber production, has already been hard hit by the transformation towards a paperless society and must now focus on new ways to add greater value to this unmatched renewable resource while also protecting biodiversity.\n\nClimate change—Canada's resource extraction industries, particularly fossil energy, contribute to GHG emissions and will be significantly affected by measures to mitigate climate change. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that meeting the Paris target will require a reduction by 2040 in world oil demand of about one-third; a reduction in natural gas demand of approximately 12%; and a reduction in coal demand of two-thirds. The impacts are not limited to oil and gas production. Biological resources such as forests, crops, and wildlife are highly sensitive to climate, which threatens people's livelihoods in resource-dependent communities. For example, climate change is affecting tree growth and vulnerability to new insects. While climate change is exposing agriculture to greater extremes, longer frost-free growing seasons are creating potential benefits. Mining operations can also be disrupted by climate change. New opportunities, however, are arising from growing demand from low-carbon technologies that will require massive supplies of specific minerals for solar cells, batteries, and windmills. In sum—(i) all of Canada's resource sectors will face significant adaptation requirements that can be mitigated, however, by management measures to increase resilience; (ii) the shift towards a \"circular economy\" will require resource industries to design out the concept of waste by rethinking the potential value of materials before they become waste; and (iii) the forest and agriculture sectors can play a large role in reducing atmospheric CO2 by sequestering carbon and adopting innovative practices that minimize emissions.\n\nDigitalizationFootnote 9— Larger Canadian resource companies are generally at or near the leading edge in applying digital technology although much of the forestry and agricultural sectors is behind the adoption curve. A rapid increase in uptake by small and medium-sized enterprises is urgently needed. In many cases, this depends on the availability of high-speed internet throughout rural Canada. The federal government has set a target to make speeds of 50/100 Mbps available to all Canadian households by 2030. Currently, the target speed is available to virtually all urban households, but to only slightly more than 40% in rural areas and 30% on First Nations reserves; so there is urgent work to do. Remote operations and inspection (via the Internet of Things) could expand once data connectivity issues are resolved and technologies improve operations in environments that lack GPS service. As low-orbit satellite systems become available and provide ubiquitous high-bandwidth connection, robots \"in the wild\" may be possible. Robotics will also help alleviate the chronic labour shortage in many resource industries that otherwise have had to rely on temporary foreign workers. As resource industries become progressively more digital, issues of cybersecurity and data governance will need to be addressed in many novel contexts.Footnote 10\n\nCompetitiveness—The foregoing structural factors will combine to challenge the competitiveness of Canada's resource industries on whose export earnings Canada depends heavily. Most sectors have relied for generations on the sheer scale of the nation's endowment and on a business strategy that involved relatively little upgrading (\"rip and ship\"). In many sectors—certainly oil and gas and forestry—that model is already losing viability and in virtually every case there are unexploited opportunities to add greater value to Canada's natural resources and expand markets more aggressively, while adopting practices that are more sustainable. Needed is a much greater commitment to innovation and technology investment.\n\nTo compete and thrive in the context of changing global demand, climate change, and rapid digitalization, the development of Canada's resource sectors will need to embody the following four characteristics, which also emerged as over-arching considerations in the discussions of other Subgroups.\n\nResilience: Building resilience is needed to cope with the varieties of stress due to climate change. Local resilience is essential in remote communities whose economies depend on resources and are also challenged by the consequences of accelerating climate change, which include exacerbated food insecurity. Since increased resilience will often require some sacrifice of short-run economic efficiency and profitability, ways need to be found to increase the incentives that encourage resilient practices and investment.\n\nTrust: The inherent volatility of resource industries, now exacerbated by climate change, has heightened anxiety in communities that depend on resources, potentially leading to fragile trust. Trust is also an issue in Indigenous communities where land rights remain unresolved or where there is a legacy of unfulfilled promises. Trust and credibility gaps must be bridged if Canada's resource economy is to achieve its potential.\n\nGovernance: Robust, innovative governance and legal structures can help build resilience and trust. Outdated frameworks risk perpetuating what now may be perceived as an inequitable sharing of the benefits and costs of resource development. Modern governance structures need to accommodate increased engagement of citizens as well as the established decision-making rights of Indigenous communities.\n\nInnovation: Canada's resource industries—facing the challenges of climate change but also the opportunities of digitalization and growing global demand—must become more innovative in product and practice. Innovation is a creative process, and it typically disrupts entrenched habits and vested interests. It therefore often emerges in contested spaces where contending objectives at first appear incompatible, e.g., between resource companies and affected Indigenous communities. The tension motivates the very creativity from which, ideally, all parties can benefit.\n\nPerspectives on the Future\n\nDrawing on the foregoing context, the ideas developed and discussed by the Subgroup can be encapsulated in the following three Statements that identify key features of Canada's resource future from the perspective of 2030-35:\n\n2.1 Advances in technologies to decarbonize production and use of oil and gas enable Canada to achieve substantial emissions reductions while continuing to produce these resources for domestic and export markets.\n\n2.2 Canada employs innovative technology to augment its natural advantages in agri-food production.\n\n2.3 Canada's forest and mineral resources meet growing global demand through innovative ways to extract greater value with reduced environmental impact.\n\nSeveral of the specific ideas originally submitted by Subgroup members are featured under each Statement to provide concrete illustrations. These Statements and illustrative examples are not intended to be hard and fast predictions or to present a comprehensive picture of Canada's resource future. Rather, they comprise a number of informed perspectives on potential developments that Subgroup members believe will be important for Canada. Moreover, the Statements are to some extent aspirational, although the Subgroup believes they are achievable with sufficient commitment from the public and private sectors and from individuals.\n\n2.1 Advances in technologies to decarbonize production and use of oil and gas enable Canada to achieve substantial emissions reductions while continuing to produce these resources for domestic and export markets.\n\nThe energy sector as a whole accounted in 2019 for more than 10% of Canada's GDP and 23% of goods exports, with exports of oil and gas alone totalling more than $122 billion. Governments and the oil & gas sector have until recently assumed that the prosperity generated by hydrocarbons would continue. Forecasts of declining demand were often questioned. While there is still considerable uncertainty about the time path of future demand for oil and gas, the \"Evolving Scenario\" in Canada's Energy Futures 2020 shows domestic consumption of fossil fuels to be 12% lower in 2030 than the 2019 peak, and 35% lower by 2050. Meanwhile, the 2020 IEA Outlook foresees, in its \"Sustainable Development Scenario\", a decline in global demand between 2019 and 2040 of about 35% for oil and 15% for natural gas (Figure 2.1). (The IEA's \"Stated Policies Scenario\"—essentially the status quo—sees global oil demand increasing slightly, then flattening by the mid-2020s, whereas demand for natural gas would increase by about 30% between 2019 and 2040.)\n\nAs a relatively high-cost oil producer, Canada is at risk of losing market share in the face of falling global demand and average price reductions in a future where GHG emissions eventually decline towards zero. The outlook for Canadian natural gas is more optimistic in view of its lower emissions and continuing use in (dispatchable) electricity generation to complement the intermittency of wind and solar, as well as growing export opportunities for liquefied natural gas.\n\nNevertheless, in light of Canada's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, policies need to shift from facilitating the growth of oil production to transitioning to a non-carbon-intensive energy system. The ongoing importance of the energy sector in Canada creates a large incentive for innovation to reduce emissions associated with hydrocarbon extraction; to enable very low-emission combustion (e.g., carbon capture, utilization, and storage: CCUS); and to develop clean renewables (wind, solar, bioenergy, geothermal) adapted to Canadian conditions.\n\nFigure 2.1 Global Fuel Supply by Scenario, 2010-40Footnote 11\n\nFigure 2.1 - Text version\n\nThis chart shows the impact of two scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) from 2010 through 2040 on both oil and natural gas supply, expressed in Megatonnes of Oil Equivalent or MTOE. The first scenario is the Stated Policies Scenario, also called STEPS. The STEPS scenario reflects the impact of existing policy frameworks and policy intentions in order to illustrate consequences for energy use, emissions and energy security for policy makers. The second scenario is the Sustainable Development Scenario, also called SDS. The SDS scenario outlines a major transformation of the global energy system in order to achieve the outcomes of energy-related United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nIn both scenarios, oil supply rises from around 4,000 MTOE in 2010 to around 4,700 MTOE in 2017 before falling to between 4,100 and 4,200 MTOE in 2020, likely due to the effects of oversupply and COVID-19. Under the STEPS scenario, oil supply recovers from this dip and likely rises to a value just under 5,000 MTOE by 2040. However, under the SDS scenario, oil supply rises slightly after 2020, but then drops rapidly after 2022 to end up at just over 3,000 MTOE by 2040.\n\nOn the other hand, natural gas supply rises from 2010 around 2,800 MTOE in 2010 to around 3,400 MTOE by 2017, before falling slightly to between 3,200 and 3,300 MTOE in 2020. Under the STEPS scenario, natural gas supply resumes rising from 2020 to approximately 4,400 MTOE by 2040. Under the SDS scenario, however, natural gas supply continues dropping from 2020 to end up back around 2010 levels of 2,800 MTOE by 2040.\n\nNote: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. SDS = Sustainable Development Scenario.\n\nAll credible energy decarbonization scenarios foresee a role for carbon capture and storage (CCS) due to the significant lock-in associated with current fossil energy infrastructure and the difficulty in decarbonizing some industrial sectors, notably cement production, steel, and petrochemicals. Canada is already a global leader in CCS, particularly due to the Shell Quest facility in Alberta, plus many other \"made-in-Canada\" innovations.Footnote 12 For example, Carbon Engineering's breakthrough technology uses a chemical scrubbing process to remove CO2 directly from the air while Mangrove Water Technologies' electrochemical reactor is equipped with ion-selective membranes that desalinate wastewater and convert the CO2 emitted from oil and gas operations into carbonate salts and acids for on-site use. CarbonCure and Solidia have developed technologies that use captured carbon in concrete production where it remains trapped indefinitely.Footnote 13 Policy to support continued investment combined with public procurement would catalyze the growth and maturity of these emerging technologies and products, consolidating their role as cornerstones of Canada's low-carbon future and creating jobs and export opportunities.\n\nAchieving Canada's ambitious emissions reduction targets, on the path to net-zero in 2050, requires significant increases in electricity generation and use. By 2050 electricity could provide more than 27% of Canada's final energy use according to a recent scenario as compared with 16% currently. This increase would include, in addition to a transition to electric vehicles, electrification of many high-temperature industrial processes that are currently reliant on fossil fuels. Dramatic reduction in GHG emissions from electricity generation is therefore needed, while maintaining the reliability of large grid electricity supply.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n2.1(a). Natural gas combined cycle with carbon capture and storage helps assure Canada's electricity supply while reducing GHG emissions.\n\nOngoing technology advances and supportive government policies could enable natural gas \"combined cycle with CCS\" to realize CO2 capture efficiencies of 90% or more and be cost competitive with other low-emission generating sources for major grid supply. This could capitalize on Canada's abundant natural gas supply and carbon storage capacity, develop a technology and skills base for export, and create value through use of captured CO2. The International CCS Knowledge Centre at University of Regina is doing leading work on this technology.\n\nCurrently, the commercial viability of CCS is mitigated by significant capital costs and the cost of the energy needed to extract carbon from combustion processes. Continued innovation will encourage broad deployment, resulting in scale economies. At present, CCS adds typically three or four cents per kilowatt-hour to the cost of electricity produced with natural gas. Creating value from the captured carbon will continue to improve the economics of the process. Captured CO2 could be used to manufacture a diverse range of products, including concrete, fuels, chemicals, and plastics, with some produced at market-competitive rates.\n\nUnlocking the full benefits of energy innovation in resources is challenged by the technical and organizational complexity of integrating multiple solutions, e.g., storage, generation, grid integration, and, where feasible, use of the captured carbon in other products where it can be securely sequestered for very long periods.\n\n2.1(b). Canada is a global leader in \"blue\" hydrogen supply and use coupled with carbon capture and storage.\n\nIn December 2020, the federal government released a document describing a hydrogen strategy for Canada, outlining the role of this potentially important fuel choice for net-zero energy systems of the future. It is in Canada's interests to pursue both \"green\" hydrogen (produced from electrolysis of water using carbon-free electricity) and \"blue\" hydrogen (produced from natural gas and coupled with CCS). Canada has a competitive advantage in blue hydrogen production, which may be a game-changer for energy use, not only as an industrial feedstock but also as an end-use fuel supporting transportation, heating buildings, and generating electricity. Hydrogen production (including in the compact liquid state) could provide another market channel for Canada's abundant natural gas supply and, when applied to oil sands upgrading and refining, could materially reduce lifecycle GHG emissions intensity.\n\nA supportive policy environment, continuing advances in technology, and collaborative partnerships to develop the necessary production and distribution infrastructure would be required for Canada to establish a leadership position in blue hydrogen. Currently, only two facilities produce blue hydrogen from natural gas with CCS: Shell's Quest plant in Alberta and Air Products' plant at the Valero Port Arthur Refinery in Texas. Equinor has recently announced its plan to build Europe's first large-scale blue hydrogen facility in northeast England by 2026. Among many uncertainties associated with blue hydrogen, cost will be a factor in the context of alternatives and objectives for emissions reduction. The volume of demand for hydrogen, despite its promise in principle, remains uncertain as does Canada's relative competitiveness as a supplier to domestic and export markets. Nevertheless, the urgency of the global challenge posed by climate change means that Canada will have to place some bets on technologies despite significant uncertainties.\n\n2.2 Canada employs innovative technology to augment its natural advantages in agri-food production.\n\nAgri-food production is an area of tremendous opportunity for Canada, employing more than half a million people and generating about $60 billion of export sales, making Canada the world's fifth largest food exporter. With ample land and water resources, and a global reputation for food safety, Canada has the potential to produce, process, distribute as well as export far more than our relatively small population consumes although there is also potential to more effectively supply our own market. The growth opportunity is illustrated by the fact that Canada's agri-food exports to China—a market with huge future potential—almost quadrupled between 2009 and 2018.\n\nComplementary to increased agri-food production and export growth, Canada must ensure that the agri-food industry innovates so as to mitigate and adapt to climate change, enhance health outcomes, prevent or reduce land degradation, and improve food security and resilience. The scale of the challenge and opportunity is illustrated by the fact, for example, that approximately a quarter of GHGs come from the food and agriculture sector and, without mitigation, emissions are expected to increase by another 30% by 2050. Meanwhile, chronic diseases in Canada related to poor eating cost the public purse an estimated $26 billion per year despite the recent promotion of healthy diets. The agri-food industry—through its product development and marketing strategies—bears some share of the responsibility to promote healthier choices and to complement the poverty-reduction measures needed to overcome food insecurity.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n2.2(a). \"Smart\" farms boost production, reduce potentially harmful agri-food inputs, enhance soil health, and bolster Canada's reputation as the world's trusted source of safe and sustainable agricultural exports.\n\nFarm management decisions are increasingly being made by algorithms operating on huge amounts of data on soil, genomic, market, and climate/weather conditions. These tools can help boost production and reduce the environmental footprint of farming, allowing Canada to produce food more intensively but with greater ecological sensitivity. Today's \"smart\" farms require investments in a range of robotics and AI-related fields. Canadian farms are already using robots, e.g., hands-free tractors, drones, and a variety of specialized harvesting devices. Becoming a global leader in precision agriculture also requires Canada to invest in rural broadband, data management and governance, and cybersecurity. Stronger environmental policy could create financial incentives to reduce pollution and promote ecosystem services. It is expected that the government's commitment to a steadily rising carbon price will significantly sharpen the incentives to adopt technologies that result in more efficiently used agricultural inputs.\n\n2.2(b). Autonomous and year-round indoor fruit and vegetable production improves Canada's food security by reducing its dependency on imports.\n\nTechnological advances, combined with new land-use and environmental policies, have the potential to make Canada a horticultural powerhouse in the near future. The year-round production of clean and nutritious food could be a cornerstone of our post-pandemic green recovery platform by scaling up existing indoor food production expertise to increase yield and produce more varieties of fruits and vegetables. Current initiatives include year-round tropical fruit in British Columbia, strawberries in Ontario, and greenhouses in northern communities during the long daylight in summertime.\n\nContinued research on rapidly maturing, affordable, and appropriate technologies including, but not limited to, robotics, LED lighting, plant microbiomes, genomic-led assisted diagnostics and crossbreeding, and a cybersecurity data infrastructure could put Canada among the global leaders, joining countries like the Netherlands and Israel at the leading edge of ag-tech, and more self-sufficient in fruits and vegetables. It would also create new export opportunities in foodstuffs and ag-tech services. Moving fruit and vegetable production indoors, and linking this with land-use planning, could enable transformation of currently farmed land into refuges for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. The cost of energy inputs is the key challenge, but indoor production sites co-located with industry would provide an opportunity to use waste heat.\n\n2.2(c). Consumers increasingly choose safe, nutritious, and economically efficient protein sources that are good for animal welfare and have a minimal environmental footprint.\n\nBroad advances in cellular agriculture—the production of animal proteins in laboratories—and plant-based protein sources portend a major disruption in the traditional protein sector over the next 10 years and beyond. Already, major livestock companies such as Tyson and Maple Leaf have made large investments in alternative protein supplies, including those that are plant-based. Advances in cellular agriculture have lowered the cost of lab-based animal proteins such that they are almost cost competitive with traditional livestock protein. And since \"alt-protein\" feedstock is yeast-based, it can use waste products from other industries, such as wood processors that are looking for new markets for their residue to offset the decline in pulp and paper. In addition to creating an entirely new sector of the economy, alt-protein must overcome resistance from the well-entrenched traditional producers and the cautions from a health point of view to avoid excessive consumption of highly and ultra-highly processed foods.\n\nFor Canada to become a global leader in this emerging field, investments in the fundamental science of cellular agriculture are required as well as policies to assist the transition of the livestock sector to a variety of new paradigms. Canada is currently lagging in this research with most investment focused on maximizing production under the prevailing model. In addition, there are legal and regulatory issues involving food labelling that effectively protects traditional sources, e.g., which products have the right to be labelled as \"dairy\" and how existing policies could apply to entirely new products that are substitutes for those currently supply-managed.\n\n2.3 Canada's forest and mineral resources meet growing global demand through innovative ways to extract greater value with reduced environmental impact.\n\nIn 2019, Canada's mining, oil and gas, and forest industries (including pulp and paper) accounted for almost 10% of GDP, or $200 billion of real (2012 $) value added. About two-thirds consisted of oil and gas and almost 20% of other unprocessed minerals. On the positive side of the ledger, these industries continue to be of vital importance, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of communities, and providing billions of export earnings. On the negative side, their environmental impact is much less tolerated today than formerly. Progress has been made, but standards keep tightening. Perhaps most significantly, the oil and gas sector generates about a quarter of Canada's GHG emissions (including petroleum refining and fugitive emissions from production), a proportion that has been increasing with oil sands output. The mining and pulp and paper industries, on the other hand, together generate only about 1.5% of Canada's GHG total, and this proportion has been declining.\n\nThe future for these primary resource industries is challenging. They need to stop pollution, drastically cut emissions, restore land, minimize waste, and add greater value to the raw materials. And they need to do all this while being profitable. That in a nutshell is the competitiveness challenge. Fortunately, the world needs more Canadian resources to support the rapidly growing demands of huge, more affluent populations, particularly in Asia. But the intense competition for these growing markets means that Canadian resource industries must become more innovative, particularly in the use and disposal of waste materials, and more outward looking beyond traditional U.S. markets, notably in developing capabilities along the global value chain for strategic minerals.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n2.3(a). Bioproduct platforms generate consumer materials with new properties while also promoting decarbonization.\n\nTo meet Canada's target of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, the economy requires both an industrial shift and a consumer shift away from petroleum-based products towards greater use of products based on current biological materials that are recyclable/compostable (i.e., part of the \"circular economy\"). Lumber production, for example, generates significant wastes that are normally redirected to wood panels or pulp and paper production. With reduced paper demand, a large supply is now available to feed a developing bioeconomy. The use of fibres from biomaterial depends on their ability to provide differentiating functions, while respecting manufacturing specifications. The technology to functionalize fibres/molecules with new properties uses the same chemistry as petroleum, but with a sustainable source of materials. Recent work demonstrates the potential of using regenerated fibres from chemically modified pulp, dissolved in an aqueous solution, to produce designer fibres from cellulose. The novel high-quality fibres could be used in applications that require high absorbency, such as diapers and other hygienic products, as well as for wound care. They could eventually be used in construction and electronic materials, and for more speculative uses such as engineered human tissue.\n\n2.3(b). The growing global commitment to environmental protection and human safety challenges Canada to be a world leader in the safe and efficient management of mining waste.\n\nSafety is the top issue facing the global mineral extraction industry (including mining and oil and gas production). The concern encompasses both environmental protection/restoration and the safety of workers and adjacent communities. Storage facilities are failing more frequently and with more severe outcomes, e.g., the tailings dam failure at Vale's Córrego do Feijão mine. An international group of 142 scientists, community groups, and NGOs from 24 countries recently published 16 guidelines for the safer storage of mine waste, asserting that the ultimate goal of tailings management must be zero harm to people and the environment. Technology is key in helping miners comply with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, guidelines released in August 2020 and aimed at strengthening current practices\n\nAs a leading mining jurisdiction, Canada should be, and in many respects is, a world leader in setting and meeting standards for reducing the environmental impact of mineral extraction, both above and below ground, while allowing greater resource recovery. For example, minimizing the environmental footprint of oil sands production and cleaning up abandoned oil and gas wells (which can emit GHGs and potentially pollute water supplies) are high-profile opportunities to demonstrate commitment and best practices and development of new technology and expertise that can generate new businesses that can export their expertise to other jurisdictions. However, if other jurisdictions do not impose standardized regulations requiring safe waste disposal, those that do are placed at a competitive disadvantage. Canada therefore has a strong incentive to promote high international standards with meaningful penalties for violation. The challenge is more than technological and economic. Trust in the mining and oil and gas industries has, in many cases, been eroded because the concerns of directly affected communities—often Indigenous and remote—were not sufficiently respected. While there are a great many examples of positive and constructive industry-community relationships, this has not always been the case, leaving a credibility gap that requires creative social and political engagement to overcome.\n\n2.3(c). Canada is challenged to go beyond \"action plans\" to sustain its position as a key global supplier of many strategic minerals.\n\nCanada is an important supplier of 13 of the 35 minerals that the U.S. has identified as critical to economic and national security: it is the largest supplier of potash, indium, aluminum, and tellurium; the second largest supplier of niobium, tungsten, and magnesium; and supplies roughly one-quarter of U.S. uranium needs. China is one of the top suppliers of 20 of these minerals and, of those, the top supplier of 10. Canada could potentially become a reliable source of other critical minerals, particularly rare earth elements that are essential inputs to the low-carbon and digitalized world economy. But, to maximize this potential, Canada needs to develop capabilities along the value chain beyond mining where our activity is currently concentrated.\n\nThe Canada–U.S. Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals Collaboration, finalized in January 2020 but with many details still to be negotiated, signifies the intention to advance a mutual interest in securing supply chains for the minerals needed for important manufacturing sectors, including communication technology, aerospace and defence, and clean technology. Implementing the Action Plan, and overcoming the technical and capital challenges faced by many Canadian producers of strategic minerals, requires significant industry support and resources that go beyond guided cooperation and promotion of joint initiatives. The federal government has an important role to play in ensuring the future of this strategic industry and achieving mineral security by encouraging wider domestic production and use of value-added mineral products, particularly through government procurement (e.g., by the Department of Defence). Failure to take action would result in Canada being left behind as other countries, notably China, continue to drive prices down, pursue nationalist protective agendas, and further secure dominant positions in strategic global supply chains.\n\n3. Big data and Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe Context\n\nThe globally interconnected network of microchips, and the software that endows them with capability, constitutes a \"cyber-nervous system\" for the planet. This system is both generating and consuming exponentially growing volumes of data—hence \"Big Data\"—on the basis of which its subsystems are learning and becoming progressively more artificially intelligent. This has given rise to the ubiquitous prefix \"smart\", associated first with phones, and now attached to just about anything that seeks to represent the future. Even with the rapid evolution of Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI), their revolutionary impact on the economy, society, and culture appears to be still only in its early stages.\n\nData Generated by the Internet in a Single Day.\n\nIn 2019, a single day in the life of the Internet involved:\n\n95 million photos and videos shared on Instagram;\n\n350 million photos uploaded to Facebook;\n\n500 million tweets sent via Twitter;\n\n3.5 billion Google web searches (around 70% of all web searches);\n\n65 billion messages sent over WhatsApp; and\n\n294 billion emails sent, most of them spam.\n\nAI, like all disruptive technologies, is a double-edged sword: benefits come bundled with risks and downsides. This means we need to think deeply about the vulnerabilities and potential unintended consequences that AI creates, so as to proactively mitigate the risks that can be reasonably foreseen: disruption of current jobs, industries, politics, and relationships; and new vulnerabilities as AI comes to play a greater role in critical systems like health-care delivery, finance, power generation and distribution, along with government, societal, and business processes of all kinds.\n\nCanada has played an outsized role in AI development where we rank among the world's leaders thanks to some farsighted investments in talent and research, and government policy that has helped foster a thriving domestic AI ecosystem. Canada's leadership is mostly due to its machine-learning expertise, with initial research supported by CIFAR and later by the federal government's Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy (see recent impact assessment). Since 2010, this expertise, along with Canada's unique combination of AI-related public and private investment, has generated more than 50,000 jobs and nearly $3 billion in investment, including from global technology giants like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. The impacts of Canadian AI developments have been felt far beyond our borders and illustrate the double-edged nature of the technology. For example, while machine learning has helped catch animal poachers in Africa and loggers illegally cutting the Amazon rainforest, it is also being used to produce \"deepfake\" images and videos that harass and degrade women or promote child abuse and human trafficking. In fact, the use of AI algorithms to alter virtually any digital object—an image, a video, a voice recording—in ways that are undetectable has the frightening potential to further undermine trust and social agreement regarding what is \"true\".\n\nCanada's status among the leaders in AI is far from assured as the public and private sectors in the U.S., China, the EU, India, and others establish AI as a national priority. For example, China's AI strategy underpins its aim to become the world leader by 2030. Similarly, the 2021 National AI Initiative Act constitutes the U.S. plan for ensuring leadership in AI R&D. Since AI must be \"trained\" on very large volumes of data, smaller countries like Canada are at a disadvantage. This makes it doubly important that we overcome challenges such as the huge amount of data that cannot be used because it is not integrated into a homogenous format, the fragmented administration of data, and individuals' mistrust in sharing their data. Canada's labyrinthine federal and provincial data privacy laws are confounding, disconnected, and often conflicting. One consequence is that this privacy quagmire forces health-care researchers to create siloed data repositories that hinder development of domestic AI health-care applications. In response, some researchers have relocated to the U.S. In applications that must be sensitive to local conditions, it is important that the AI algorithms be trained on local data (e.g., reflecting prevalent health conditions or particular speech patterns). In these cases, Canada should not have to rely on tools developed elsewhere. To be given access by Canadians to their personal data, however, trust must be earned. Partly that is a matter of explaining the benefits. But it also requires credible and transparent safeguards of security and privacy.Footnote 14\n\nThe development and training of AI systems must reflect the diversity of the affected populations. For example, algorithmic bias can arise due to a lack of diversity in the data on which these systems are trained. This has perpetuated biases in machine-learning systems used in law enforcement, health care, and human resources, among others. Canadian organizations (e.g., Montréal AI Ethics Institute) are prominent in work that seeks to correct such biases, but clearly more needs to be done. Because AI will increasingly affect the lives of all Canadians, it is essential to minimize the unconscious bias that can easily creep into many applications. This means that the developers of the systems should include a diversity that approximately reflects the make-up of the population. In this regard, the under-representation of women in developer communities has been recognized as a major problem.\n\nPerspectives on the Future\n\nDrawing on the foregoing context, the ideas developed and discussed by the Subgroup can be encapsulated in the following two Statements that identify key developments in Big Data and AI from the perspective of 2030-35:\n\n3.1 Sustained heavy investment by government and industry in fundamental AI research and niche applications enables Canada to retain its competitive edge and reputation as a world leader in the field.\n\n3.2 Growing cost pressures drive greater efficiency in the provision of health care in Canada, finally overcoming the reluctance of the fragmented system to share data and accelerating the adoption of AI in clinical and administrative practice.\n\nSeveral of the specific ideas originally submitted by Subgroup members are featured under each Statement to provide concrete illustrations. These Statements and illustrative examples are not intended to be hard and fast predictions or to present a comprehensive picture of Canada's future. Rather, they comprise a number of informed perspectives on potential developments in Big Data and AI—a general purpose technology that could eventually affect almost everything—that Subgroup members believe will be important for Canada. Moreover, the Statements are to some extent aspirational, although the Subgroup believes they are achievable with sufficient commitment from the public and private sectors and from individuals.\n\n3.1. Sustained heavy investment by government and industry in fundamental AI research and niche applications enables Canada to retain its competitive edge and reputation as a world leader in the field.\n\nCurrent machine-learning methods are based primarily on detecting correlations in data, e.g., if A occurs often, then B occurs often as well. Deep learning (a technique for implementing machine learning) is engineered to find complex correlational patterns in data and has advanced to the point of outperforming humans in specialized tasks that can be precisely defined and bounded, e.g., deciphering hand-written text or spoken words, diagnosing skin cancer in medical images. Impressive as these types of performance are, such brittle \"idiot savant\" systems are limited in generalizing from past (training) data to handle new situations. For example, a machine-learning system could tell photos of huskies and wolves apart only because snow appeared in the husky images, but not the wolf images. An image of a wolf in snow (i.e., a new situation) would be identified (incorrectly) as a husky. To resolve a wider array of situations, the AI would need exposure to larger, consistently annotated training data (images, video, audio, text, and structured data) that featured those situations—clearly a potentially open-ended requirement.\n\nCurrent approaches to addressing this limitation focus on reducing training data requirements via few shot or one shot learning, or generalizing learned patterns to related situations via transfer learning. A more revolutionary approach involves the reorientation of AI R&D towards building models based on a causal \"understanding\" of relationships between real-world variables, rather than simply finding more elaborate pattern recognition methods. For example, curriculum learning is based on how very young children learn, and reinforcement learning on an iterative simulation with rewards and penalties tied to a desired outcome. Related research is aiming to teach AI systems different types of \"common sense\" that could be used to build a model of the world from text or video, including physical common sense (i.e., knowledge of objects and real-world physics) and social common sense (i.e., knowledge of what people do, why they do it, and its emotional impact). AIs that incorporate such a knowledge system could learn the answer to questions like: \"Which of the following household items is the best to roll dough: a) a plate, b) a bottle, or c) a spoon?\" It is usually the case that tasks that are trivial (or unconscious) for humans are very difficult to render as AI, whereas tasks that are very tough for humans (like complex math calculations and logic puzzles) are child's play for a properly engineered AI.\n\nAs well as work to improve AI understanding of causality, the development of explainable AI is needed so that users can trust the output, which otherwise could remain completely unintuitive and inscrutable. For example, more explainable AI would help address rising concern about the potential for algorithmic bias influencing automated decision making. Interest in explainable AI is increasing as various jurisdictions (e.g., New York City, EU, Canada) consider adding a \"right to an explanation\" within legislation and guidelines on automated decision making, particularly for life-altering decisions like prison sentencing or mortgage approvals. Such initiatives would establish a degree of fairness, accountability, and transparency between an AI system and those who are affected by its recommendations and decisions.\n\nBy understanding causal relationship and improving the ability to explain recommendations or decisions, the next generation of AI systems would be more robust in new or unexpected circumstances, more data- and energy-efficient to train, and easier to trust since humans easily understand explanatory causal models. But developing these systems would require interdisciplinary teams of data scientists, software engineers, ethicists, designers, and user experience practitioners—all seeking to bridge the gap between humans and the AI systems working on their behalf. This would open the door to building AI tools that work alongside humans on tackling complex problems such as climate change or finding the biomarkers of disease progression.\n\nIllustrative examples\n\n3.1(a). Natural language processing systems are indistinguishable from human communication in both intelligence and empathy.\n\nRapid advances in natural language processing (NLP) systems, which aim to teach machines how to interpret the nuances of human language, have the potential to improve human productivity and manifest ingenuity in unparalleled ways. Recent developments such as Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT-3, language models that use deep learning to generate human-like text, are demonstrating the capabilities and potential applications of advanced NLP models, particularly in education and the workplace. However, building these applications carries risks related to the scale and nature of data needed to train models as well as ethical considerations such as the potential for bias, racial insensitivity, and false information. Ignoring the risk of factually incorrect and socially inappropriate models has resulted in NLP-based chatbots that spew hate speech or AI systems that misunderstand simple situations.\n\nAlthough most NLP models are currently developed elsewhere, Canada has the research capability and trained talent pool to position the country for building the next generation of models. Canada's development of many of the deep-learning methods used for NLP models has attracted AI talent, much of which has stayed and launched AI startups.\n\nCanada's low energy costs and availability of renewable energy create an attractive training location for AI (which is very energy intensive) and technology companies. A 2019 study found that CO2 equivalent emissions from training a model using a server in Quebec, where virtually all electricity is hydro-generated, was around 20 g, versus 736 g (less than 3%) from an Iowa-based server.\n\n3.1(b). Brain-computer interfaces and haptic (\"touch\") simulation are common ways to interact with computers.\n\nThe ubiquitous keyboard predates every other component of modern personal computers by a century. However, this interface device is likely to be at least partially replaced in the next five to seven years with interfaces that enable human-computer communications via simulated touch (haptics) or even thought (brain-computer interfaces).\n\nDue to their inherent sensitivity, hand or finger-based haptic interfaces create the pos"
