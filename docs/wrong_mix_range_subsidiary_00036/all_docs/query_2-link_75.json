        "text": "Molecular dynamics simulations can complement experimental measures of structure and dynamics of biomolecules. The quality of such simulations can be tested by comparisons to models refined against experimental crystallographic data. We report simulations of DNA and RNA duplexes in their crystalline environment. The calculations mimic the conditions for PDB entries 1D23 [d(CGATCGATCG)2] and 1RNA [(UUAUAUAUAUAUAA)2], and contain 8 unit cells, each with 4 copies of the Watson-Crick duplex; this yields in aggregate 64μs of duplex sampling for DNA and 16μs for RNA. The duplex structures conform much more closely to the average structure seen in the crystal than do structures extracted from a solution simulation with the same force field. Sequence-dependent variations in helical parameters, and in groove widths, are largely maintained in the crystal structure, but are smoothed out in solution. However, the integrity of the crystal lattice is slowly degraded in both simulations, with the ...\n\nThe (4′→6′)-linked DNA homolog 2′,3′-dideoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl nucleic acid (dideoxy-glucose nucleic acid or homo-DNA) exhibits stable self-pairing of the Watson–Crick and reverse-Hoogsteen types, but does not cross-pair with DNA. Molecular modeling and NMR solution studies of homo-DNA duplexes pointed to a conformation that was nearly devoid of a twist and a stacking distance in excess of 4.5 Å. By contrast, the crystal structure of the homo-DNA octamer dd(CGAATTCG) revealed a right-handed duplex with average values for helical twist and rise of ca. 15° and 3.8 Å, respectively. Other key features of the structure were strongly inclined base-pair and backbone axes in the duplex with concomitant base-pair slide and cross-strand stacking, and the formation of a dimer across a crystallographic dyad with inter-duplex base swapping. To investigate the conformational flexibility of the homo-DNA duplex and a potential influence of lattice interactions on its geometry, we used molecular dy...\n\nObjective: The objective of the study was to elucidate the structural activity of a natural DNA sequence modified by a hydrophobic base-pair which didn't form Watson-Crick (W-C) hydrogen-bond. The modified unnatural base-pair (DNAM-D5SICS) was introduced in DNA sequences of 14-mer for molecular dynamics study in water solution. Methods: A 200 ns molecular-dynamics-simulation in orthogonal-box-water-solvent, using Particle-mesh-Ewald-method (PME) within periodicboundary-condition (PBC) was performed by using AMBER-14 code. The force-field-ff12SB-force-field was used during the simulation while the force-field-parameters of modified base-pair, compatible to ff12SB-force-field, were calculated by Gaussian-09-code using ab-inito/Hartree-Fockmethodology. The code CPPTRAJ, (a module of AMBER-14) CURVE and Chimera were used in the analysis of the data. Results: Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of heavy atoms of the trajectory revealed that the structure of the equilibrated duplex was stable, sequence-dependent and had mixed DNA-conformation. A little distortion near to the neighbor of the modified base-pair in the duplex strand was observed. However, we got a stabilized structure of such type of duplex if we placed modified base-pair after the third place in the strand. Conclusion: The study concluded that the distortion produced by modified-base-pair in the overall structure of duplex was local while the confirmation of such type of duplex was mixed and maintained the Watson-Crick (W-C) integrity of DNA. The study would help in the use of hydrophobic base-pair materials in biotechnological applications and the understanding of their structure-function relationship.\n\nA combined molecular dynamics/density-functional theoretical study was carried out to address the propensity of ambient water to form cross-strand bridging water (CSBW) and their effects on the electronic properties of a fully hydrated DNA duplex 5'-d(CCATTAATGG) 2-3'. The simulation shows ubiquitous presence of up to five CSBWs along the minor groove, each with residence time ranging from 400 ps to 750 ps. The molecular orbitals localized on these CSBWs are nearly degenerate in energy with the highest occupied molecular orbital of DNA localized on guanine bases, strongly indicating that the hole-transport along the guanines is mediated by the ubiquitous CSBWs."
