AMBER: building a box

From: kepa koldo burusco <kepaquestions.yahoo.es>

Hi amber users!!!

I am trying to do something apparently "wierd" and amber gives me problems all the time.

I have built up a molecule made of 5 units. One is the central unit, and the other 4 are linked to that one. We are trying to study the bulk behaviour of a liquid enterely made from molecules of the same type. I mean, we are trying to create a solvent box surrounding our molecule with lots of molecules of the same type. We have been doing this with xLEaP typing:

solvatebox new_petLin new_bPl 10.0

and also

solvateDontClip new_petLin new_bPl 10.0

(new_petLin and new_bPl are "the same molecule", the different unit names are to allow easier ptraj analysis after running Molecular Dynamics)

We have tried to enlarge/reduce the box size, to change the molecular conformation (unfolded/folded), to use different versions of xLEaP (amber 7 version and amber 8 version)... and each time we get an error message similar to the one attachd to this mail:

The "solvent" molecules directly surrounding the "solute" molecule appear laking some residues due to avoid molecular overlaping, so on new "wierd" links are created among distant molecules.

It seems that se algorithm that solvates molecules expect the solvent to be a single-unit molecule...

We have also tried to delete the problematic molecules directly from the box aided by xLEaP windows tools once created, but "unfortunately" the software complains, xLEaP exists and the shell shows a "segmentation fault" message...

So... any idea? any help? anybody knows how I could build my box avoiding problems such as these???

Thank you very much in advance for your help.

Solvent has no box, so preparing by making box including vdw

(Use 'setBox centers' first if box was pre-equilibrated)
