Since May 2022 there is a new professorship for experimental physics at the Institute of Physics. We have moved from the Max-Born-Institute in Berlin to the University of Kassel to set up a new research group investigating `Structural Molecular DynamicsÂ´. We will apply experimental methods from the cutting-edge research frontier of attosecond physics to interesting scientific problems in the crossroads of physics, chemistry and material science. Processes on these unprecedented timescales represent one of the most exciting frontiers in contemporary physics.
