Marta Filizola, Professor, Pharmacological Sciences and Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, will give a talk on "Modern Drug Discovery Using Enhanced Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Artificial Intelligence."

ABSTRACT

By contributing distinctive atomic-level understanding of how drugs bind and activate their target receptors, enhanced molecular dynamics simulations leveraged by artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods are playing a pivotal role in shedding light on the complexities of receptor pharmacology, thus efficiently guiding the design of improved therapeutics. The opportunities offered by emergent technologies such as AI-based statistical machine learning and deep learning methods are unprecedented and finally made possible by access to ultra-large collections of compounds, large amounts of data generated by increasingly more accurate biochemical and biophysical studies of complex biomedical systems, as well as more powerful supercomputers and cloud computing.
