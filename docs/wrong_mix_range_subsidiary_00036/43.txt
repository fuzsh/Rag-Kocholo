Hi all,

From past one week, Iam not able to connect VMD to NAMD to run Interactive Molecular Dynamics for my system. It always shows the same error : " Unable to connect to host localhost on port number ****"

I have tried with many port numbers. But still, no change.

It'll be great if someone can provide solution for this problem.

Thanking you,

R.Daram
