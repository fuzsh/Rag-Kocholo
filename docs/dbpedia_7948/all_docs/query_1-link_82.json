But they do occasionally envision him as a master swordsman, tracker and hunter. They also might enjoy picturing him hanging out on set with fellow Princess Bride villain Wallace Shawn, who played self-proclaimed genius Vizzini.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nCult king: Chris Sarandon reigns as both evil prince and pumpkin king at Calgary Expo Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“I did no scenes with Wally at all,” says Sarandon. “It’s interesting, because people often say to me, for instance: ‘What was it like doing the sword-fighting scenes?’ And I say ‘I didn’t sword fight.’ I imitate the sword fight at the end of the sword fight. It’s pretty much the same with Wally’s scene. I come on at the very end of Wally’s scene and elucidate what happened as Prince Humperdinck, (who) never fails to know, (he’s) the hunter to end all hunters.”\n\nSarandon did, however, do a couple scenes with Cary Elwes, who played the dashing Westley. Sarandon, Shawn and Elwes will be doing separate events this weekend at the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo at Stampede Park, but will also do joint photo ops for fans of the iconic film.\n\nHaving the three actors at fan conventions is becoming a fairly regular thing, Sarandon says. Rob Reiner’s film has managed to grow in stature with each passing year. Obviously, there were hints during filming that the cast and crew had something special going on. But, as with most films, there was no way to anticipate how the end product would turn out or how the public would respond. Sarandon had read William Goldman’s book years earlier and it immediately became a favourite. The script, also by Goldman, was fantastic and Reiner was on an amazing winning streak after directing This is Spinal Tap, The Sure Thing and Stand By Me. But there are never any guarantees, he says.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“There is no way to know when you do a movie, it’s such as gossamer kind of experience,” said Sarandon. “Not only is the shooting important, the casting is important, the director is important, the screenplay is important, but also just the timing of the release and how it’s perceived by the public. In our case, for instance, it wasn’t that the movie was badly received, but it had a kind of tepid initial release. The movie really has been discovered over time via television and, at first, VHS and then DVD and now Blu-ray. People have passed it on generation after generation and it’s become an extraordinary cultural touchstone that I don’t think any of us were really prepared for.”\n\nIn fact, the film has become so widely embraced that it’s hard to define The Princess Bride as a cult movie. But as memorable as Sarandon was as the loathsome Prince of Florin, his career is full of roles that make him a perfect fit for fan conventions. After an early career in theatre and soap operas, he made his film debut in Sidney Lumet’s 1975 classic Dog Day Afternoon. In what was considered a golden age of daring and quality films, Dog Day is generally regarded as one of the best of the 1970s. Sarandon received an Oscar nomination playing Leon Shermer, the pre-op transgender wife of Al Pacino’s desperate bank-robber, Sonny Wortik. It was an auspicious entry into the world of cinema. Since then, he has studiously avoided typecasting in a remarkable career that has seen him play everything from a demon in the oddball 1977 shocker The Sentinel to Jesus in the 1980 TV movie The Day Christ Died, while continuing to work on stage.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nExpo evolution: New ownership won't change things at Calgary comic show\n\nDeadpool creator gives thumbs-up to Hollywood's take on his anti-hero\n\nBut, alongside The Princess Bride, the films he tends to be asked about most at fan conventions include Tom Holland’s 1985 teen-horror classic Fright Night, in which he played a debonair vampire, and Tim Burton’s 1993 stop-motion animated film The Nightmare Before Christmas, in which he voiced the role of Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town.\n\n“It also has an enormous following,” says Sarandon about Burton’s film. “You knew you were doing something extraordinary or special, but there was no way to know it was to become this major cultural phenomenon.”\n\nSarandon was even less certain about 1988’s Child’s Play, where he was again enlisted by writer-director Holland. This time he played the good guy, a heroic police detective investigating murders committed by a possessed doll named Chucky.\n\n“Halfway through the film, we thought ‘How is this going to work?'” Sarandon says with a laugh. “Working with different iterations of the doll was a labour of blood, sweat and tears. It was very difficult. But Tom Holland had it all in his head and he carried it off. I’m giving all appreciation to Tom for that one.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs horror buffs know, Chucky went on to become a cultural touchstone all his own, commanding an endless number of sequels. Actually, there’s been seven films altogether, including 2017’s Cult of Chucky. One gets the impression that Sarandon has not watched all of them. Or any of them, for that matter.He admits he’s not overly invested in the series.\n\n“The first one was the first one and I’ve moved on,” he says. “I don’t really think in terms of ‘Oh, they’re ruining my series of great American films.’ It is what it is.”\n\nChris Sarandon will appear at the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Stampede Park.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
