        "text": "Academy Award nominee Chris Sarandon (“Dog Day Afternoon”) chatted about his upcoming live taping of “Cooking By Heart” with Mario Cantone on April 20 in New York.\n\nSarandon will host “Cooking By Heart” with special guest Mario Cantone, a Tony-nominated actor and comedian, on Thursday, April 20 at 7:00 PM at The Green Room 42 in Manhattan. “We are really pumped about this because this is the first time that we will be doing one of the these live in New York City,” he said.\n\nAn Oscar-nominated actor\n\nHe is best known for his roles as Prince Humperdinck in “The Princess Bride,” the speaking voice of Jack Skellington in Tim Burton’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” the cunning vampire in “Fright Night,” and his Oscar-nominated role in “Dog Day Afternoon” opposite Al Pacino. “Working with Al Pacino was a very positive experience,” he said.\n\n“The Oscar nomination was interesting,” he admitted. “I started out in the theater and when I first stated doing this, I was never interested in becoming famous, I was interested in working. ‘Dog Day Afternoon’ was my first big studio movie and it happened coincidentally with all of the other theater work I was doing. It seemed like a natural progression and the fact that I was nominated for an Oscar for my performance is in it was a thrill.”\n\n“I didn’t think of my work as an actor as being one of winning awards or becoming a movie star, it was really about being a part of a process and in collaboration with others,” he added.\n\nRevisiting his Greek roots\n\nSarandon grew up working in his Greek immigrant father’s restaurant in West Virginia. Both of his Greek grandfathers owned diners and coffee shops, and his son is a trained chef, the family business. Sarandon was initially taught to cook by his mother and various cooks in his father’s restaurant. He combines his love of food with an actor’s ear for human stories. “I worked at a restaurant since I was nine years old so many of my formative memories are about food,” he said.\n\nMost recently, he has appeared in I Smile Back with Sarah Silverman, and in Adriana Trigiani’s Big Stone Gap. On television, he has appeared in recurring roles on “ER,” “The Practice,” “Felicity,” and “Judging Amy.”\n\n‘Cooking By Heart’ podcast\n\nHe created “Cooking By Heart,” a new podcast featuring his celebrity guest friends. They discuss their relationship with food, stemming from youth. In addition to the conversations, each celebrity guest will share one of their favorite recipes.\n\nOn the idea for this “Cooking By Heart” podcast, Sarandon said, “My brother-in-law and I were talking midway through the pandemic, at a time when everything was shut down, and he encouraged me to do a podcast on food, because he is a big aficionado of the podcast format. I’m always cooking for them when they come over. I thought about it and I started listening to food podcasts.”\n\n“My guests and I talk about the vivid memories of the food we grew up with, in particular, the people and the stories attached to that time of our lives. What is stronger than childhood memories. Now, it has gotten to be such an extraordinary experience in so many ways,” he added.\n\n“The podcast comes from deep within me, which is me growing up around food, the traditions, and the family, and that’s what we talk about the podcast. The stories that come out are very much attached to the deepest kind of impulses in us to connect with family and memory. Food is such a great part of that for everybody. The stories that come out of this podcast are very extraordinary, and they are a result of people remembering on the spot,” he elaborated.\n\nThe digital age\n\n“The digital age has become such a learning experience for me having grown in the analog age,” he said. “I’ve learned so much about digital media and how the gap between the digital and analog is closed by the stories we tell. The form is incidental to the stories.”\n\n“Some of the stories have been so remarkable and so heartwarming,” he said. “The human connections are still quite vivid.”\n\nSuccess\n\nOn his definition of the word success, Sarandon said, “Being able to work and doing what you love to do for most of your life, if you are lucky. It’s really about the process of doing good work and doing what I love to do. For me, it has been a wonderful ride.”\n\nFans\n\n“Thank you for bearing with me all through this,” he said. “I hope that in some way, the things that I have done have brought them a measure of joy or resolution of whatever it is that they have meant to them. That is a success as well.”"
