«Dancing even on the top Bicycling at high gear»

The song "Tour de France" in 1983 indissolubly connected the name of Kraftwerk to the world of cycling.This windbreaker pays tribute to this alliance by reproducing the album cover in the original French colours.

Kraftwerk, a German band, became famous in the early 1970s with their experimental electronic music and they are nowadays still a legend, not only in Germany but all over the world. The song "Tour de France" sampled voices and mechanical sounds associated with cycling that were used to supplement a simple electro-percussion pattern, inspiring both electronic music and cycling enthusiast.

Good music and matching clothing will make your ride unforgettable.
