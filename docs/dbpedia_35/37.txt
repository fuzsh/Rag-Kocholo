Tour de France Soundtracks is the tenth studio album by German electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk. It was released on August 4, 2003 after much anticipation, becoming their first release since 1986’s Electric Café.

The album’s recording process took around 16 years. The title track was initially released way back in June of 1983 and was originally intended to be part of the band’s scrapped Techno Pop album concept. However, for its inclusion on Tour de France Soundtracks, a completely new recording of the track featuring a new arrangement was made.

Inspiration for the album came from the Tour de France bicycle race and the band’s newfound obsession for cycling in general. Tracks on the album use sounds of bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and cyclists breathing to build percussion patterns. Unlike their previous albums that received separate language releases, only one version of Tour de France Soundtracks was released and features a hybrid of German, English and mostly French lyrics.

Coincidentally, during the recording of the title track, band member and cycling enthusiast Ralf Hütter was involved in a serious accident while riding his bicycle and remained in a coma for a few days.
