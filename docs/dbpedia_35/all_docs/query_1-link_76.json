        "text": "During every “Eras Tour” concert, there comes a time that audiences are always waiting for: surprise-song o’clock.\n\nThis is when Taylor Swift sits down with just a guitar and a piano to play acoustic versions of two songs — sometimes mashups, sometimes not — that change between each show. And fans don’t know what songs she’s chosen that night until the surprise-song set starts.\n\nSwift kicked off the European leg of her “Eras Tour” May 9 in Paris, fresh on the heels of releasing her 11th album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” on April 29. While the setlist saw some significant changes — including the addition of a new era — Swift upheld her tradition of performing surprise songs.\n\nLast year, Swift said she’d aim not to repeat surprise songs during the “Eras Tour,” leaving fans to track each night’s performances like detectives, watching their favorite songs get picked off in the lead up to their own concert date.\n\nBut after Swift announced that she “reset” the eligibility of all songs for 2024 and introduced twists, it’s impossible to predict what she’ll do next.\n\nIntrepid Swifties keeping record of all the songs Swift has performed have noted that, while there are several songs that have been played multiple times, there are some songs that the singer has not at all. Those include:\n\n\"Change\"\n\n\"That's When\"\n\n\"Bye Bye Baby\"\n\n\"Girl At Home\"\n\n\"Ronan\"\n\n\"Forever Winter\"\n\n\"I Did Something Bad\"\n\n\"London Boy\"\n\n\"Soon You'll Get Better\"\n\n\"Only the Young\"\n\n\"Beautiful Ghosts\"\n\n\"So Long, London\"\n\n\"Florida!!!\"\n\n\"Cassandra\"\n\nHere's a list of all the surprise songs Swift has performed since the start of the \"Eras Tour\" in March 2023.\n\nA running list of Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' surprise songs\n\nAug. 1: Warsaw: \"Mirrorball\" and \"Clara Bow\" mashup; \"Suburban Legends\" and \"New Year's Day\" mashup.\n\nJuly 28, Munich: \"I Don't Want To Live Forever\" and \"Imgonnagetyouback\" mashup; \"Loml\" and \"Don't You\" mashup.\n\nJuly 27, Munich: \"Fresh Out the Slammer\" and \"You Are In Love\" mashup; \"Ivy\" and \"Call It What You Want\" mashup.\n\nJuly 24, Hamburg: \"The Last Great American Dynasty\" and \"Run\" mashup; \"Nothing New\" and \"Dear Reader\" mashup.\n\nJuly 23, Hamburg: \"Teardrops on my Guitar\" and \"The Last Time\" mashup; \"We Were Happy\" and \"Happiness\" mashup.\n\nJuly 19, Gelsenkirchen: \"Paper Rings\" and \"Stay Stay Stay\" mashup; \"It's Time To Go\" and \"Better Man\" mashup.\n\nJuly 18, Gelsenkirchen: \"Speak Now\" and \"Hey Stephen\" mashup; \"This Is My Trying\" and \"Labyrinth\" mashup.\n\nJuly 17, Gelsenkirchen: \"Superstar\" and \"Invisible String\" mashup; \"Slut!\" and \"False God\" mashup.\n\nJuly 14, Milan: \"Getaway Car\" and \"Out of the Woods\" mashup; \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\" and \"Red\" mashup.\n\nJuly 13, Milan: \"The 1\" and \"Wonderland\" mashup; \"I Almost Do\" and \"The Moment I Knew\" mashup.\n\nJuly 10, Zurich: \"Closure\" and \"A Perfectly Good Heart\" mashup; \"Robin\" and \"Never Grow Up\" mashup.\n\nJuly 9, Zurich: \"Right Where You Left Me\" and \"All You Had To Do Was Stay\" mashup; \"Last Kiss\" and \"Sad Beautiful Tragic\" mashup.\n\nJuly 6, Amsterdam: \"Sweeter Than Fiction\" and \"Holy Ground\" mashup; \"Mary's Song,\" \"So High School\" and \"Everything Has Changed\" mashup.
