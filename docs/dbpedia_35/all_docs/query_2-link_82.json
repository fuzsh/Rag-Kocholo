        "text": "Another successful tour has come and gone. I traveled most of it and have been so busy I just used the same profile all week. I chose stages 14 and 19. Stage 14 we started flat and fast, then hit some smaller hills. It was a great, fun workout! We took a break before the last song so that we could push hard the last song. The competition in the room was fierce!\n\nStage 19 was a challenge. The mountain climbs were brutal! I taught it Saturday for the last time and when I taught Sunday none of us could push hard. Even this morning several of us had to go easier than usual on the hills. My glutes are still burning!\n\nAnd now sadly I’m working on yet another tribute ride for next week. Have you heard this version of Hunger Strike yet? I cry every time.\n\nStage 14:\n\nArtist Song Name Song Length Workout Gloria Gayner I Will Survive 4:57 Warm-up American Authors Go Big or Go Home 2:52 Standing run with pushes Volbeat A Warrior’s Call 4:22 Booty Backs Bond Explosive 3:24 Endurance Run Together, have the teams alternate 30 second pushes Guns N Roses Welcome To The Jungle 4:34 Sprint Pyramids – :15 -:30 – :45 – :60 – :45 – :30 – :15 Motley Crew Kick Start My Heart 4:07 Kongos Come With Me Now 3:32 Standing Fast Climb – Alternating Pushes Rolling Stones Not Fade Away 1:57 Recovery Nine Inch Nails The Hand that Feeds 3:30 Standing Fast Climb – Alternating Pushes Metallica Turn The Page 6:06 Climb – Alternating Pushes Blue October Drop 4:36 Rolling Hills – Together Haik Naltchayan The Will of a Man 1:32 Recovery into Final Push Pitbull Wild Wild Love 3:22 Ant Hills – Race hard until the end!!!

I simply cannot contain my excitement. Neither could my students, we had over 30 students in the spin room on a Wednesday night in the summer! We never pull those kinds of numbers. There were faces in there I hadn’t seen in a long time, all waving and saying “The Tour!” as I walked by. SO.MUCH.FUN. I honestly can’t stand it. I get there early and decorate the room with my Tour flags and pictures from prior tours.\n\nThere is some great Tour De France materials on ICA to talk about the terrain, etc. I keep mine more simple and competitive. I put stickers on their bikes to break them into teams. I also choose a team captain for each team before class (more on this in a minute). I print up copies of the profile for the day and create a playlist that matches it (same number of hills, etc). Obviously incredibly brief – we have 50 minutes to do what they do in over 100 miles. Then we race stationary bikes around a dark room and all is AWESOME. Blue team – GO! Green team GO! They hoot and holler and cheer each other on as they race. And then for the last song it’s up to the team captains chosen earlier. If the tour finishes on a hill that day whoever pops out of a saddle into an attack first will win IF they can hold a strong attack until the end they win. If they back off the other team wins. When they get up, the entire class has to get up and chase them. Similar on a downhill or flat – the captain who gets out of the saddle to a standing run push first gets us all up. I count us down from 10 to 1 and then we hit the saddle and sprint to the end.\n\nThe winner gets a trophy and an awesome bike bottle opener. I added these this year and couldn’t be happier with them – awesome little prizes\n\nThis year my first Tour ride was stage 5. We started together to get our legs under us. During the fast flat and the break in the middle we had Tour de France fun facts. And this year we are all super excited because Houston has it’s first ever rider in the tour – Go Lawson!!!! An extra fun fact is that my husband who is an ex pro cyclist used to ride with Lawson on the track when Lawson was a kid (ok, he still is a kid – he’s 24 and in the TOUR!!!).\n\nGreat fun was had by all (I hope) on Wednesday. Our winner jumped out of the saddle with almost 5 minutes left – we were all dying by the end of the attack but he pulled it off.\n\nArtist Song Name Song Length TOUR PROFILE Workout Rudy Theme 4:20 Warm-up Billy Idol Rebel Yell 3:45 Standing run with pushes Van Halen Jump 3:59 Booty Backs Bond Explosive 3:24 Flat Run – fun facts about the tour and get your legs under you Bon Jovi Born To Be My Baby 4:39 Slight Uphill Standing fast climb Deep Purple Fireball 3:21 Flat and fast Sprints :15 -> :30 -> :45 -> :60 -> :45 -> :30 -> :15.

After Orlando I wanted to do something pride related. Then I remembered it is pride month (how could I forget? I celebrated the SC ruling just 1 year ago at the pride parade in NYC!) and had to do something. However, I live in maybe the most conservative areas of the country. I am always careful about my music and not offending people (little to no f-bombs, etc) and although I hate to say it my playlist couldn’t be in your face this time. So I made a secret pride ride. All artists and songs we normally play, except for the fact that whether you know it or not all of them (or a member of the band) are GLBT! The only exception were songs addressing GLBT issues (take me to Church) or adopted by the community (I Will Survive). I use this for several classes and they all loved it, even if they didn’t know the meaning behind it.\n\nArtist Song Name Song Length Workout Gloria Gayner I Will Survive 4:57 Warm-up Neon Trees Everybody Talks 2:59 Standing run with pushes Scissor Sisters I Don’t Feel Like Dancing 4:48 Booty Backs Queen Don’t Stop Me Now 3:31 :30 on / :30 off sprints Queen and David Bowie Under Pressure 4:03 Climb – build and release pressure Blondie One Way or Another 3:30 Index Card Sprints Joan Jett & the Blackhearts Bad Reputation 2:48 Hozier Take Me to Church 4:02 Hill With Pushes Dusty Springfield Son Of a Preacher Man 2:25 Rest REM End of the World 4:05 :20 / :20 / :20s The Who Baba O’Riley 5:01 Rolling Hill – increasing resistance climb into a run / sprint at the end Queen Bohemian Rhapsody 6:00 Increasing resistance climb with a finishing sprint Elton John Tiny Dancer 6:16 Cool-down Eli Lieb & Brandon Skeie Pulse Stretching"
