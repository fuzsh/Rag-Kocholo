        "text": "Every Surprise Song Performed On Taylor Swift's Eras Tour So Far\n\nBy Katie Louise Smith\n\nWhat surprise songs did Taylor Swift perform on The Eras Tour? Here's the full list. (Updated live during every show)\n\nListen to this article\n\nLoading audio...\n\nTaylor Swift's The Eras Tour is in full swing, and just as fans had hoped, Taylor has confirmed that she will be performing surprise songs on every single night of the tour.\n\nIf you've been a fan of Taylor for a while, you'll know that she always includes a surprise song or two in her tour set lists. The tradition goes all the way back to the Speak Now World Tour, where she included the surprise covers she performed during that era.\n\nWith the tour now officially underway, the surprise songs are back, back, back again! There are 45 songs in the setlist already, which means she's got well over 200 songs (!!) to choose from for the surprise slots.\n\nInitially, Taylor told fans that she will only play each surprise song once, unless she messes it up. But she has now confirmed that she has ended that rule, and she will play whatever she wants, however many times she wants!\n\nSo, what surprise songs has Taylor Swift already performed on The Eras Tour and what can fans expect for the rest of the dates? Here's the full list. (We'll update this article live, during each show.)\n\nRead more: How To Listen To Capital (Taylor’s Version)\n\nTaylor Swift surprise songs: What surprise songs did Taylor Swift perform on tour?\n\nTaylor Swift surprise songs: Every surprise song that Taylor has performed on The Eras Tour so far...\n\nTaylor will be playing two surprise acoustic songs per show. After 66 dates in 2023, Taylor ended up playing an extra 124 songs, not including repeats or songs that weren't her own.\n\nAt the end of her 2023 Eras Tour shows, Taylor confirmed that the full list of surprise songs will be completely reset. In February 2024, she began adding mashups to the acoustic section. She has also confirmed that she will now completely scrap the 'only playing it once' rule, and will repeat songs if she feels like it.

A few of them are incredibly emotional and personal so she may not even perform them at all.\n\nHere's all the songs that Taylor Swift has not yet performed live on the Eras Tour:\n\nTaylor Swift: [All songs from Taylor Swift have now been performed.]\n\nFearless (Taylor's Version): 'Change', 'That’s When', 'Bye Bye Baby'\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version): [All songs from Speak Now (Taylor's Version) have been performed.]\n\nRed (Taylor's Version): 'Girl At Home', 'Ronan', 'Forever Winter'\n\n1989 (Taylor's Version): [All songs from 1989 (Taylor's Version) have now been performed.]\n\nReputation: 'I Did Something Bad'\n\nLover: 'London Boy', 'Soon You’ll Get Better'\n\nFolklore: [All songs from Folklore have now been performed.]\n\nEvermore: [All songs from Evermore have now been performed.]\n\nMidnights: [All songs from Midnights have now been performed.]\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department: 'So Long, London', 'Florida!!!', 'Cassandra'\n\nTaylor has not yet performed 'Tolerate It' as a surprise song after removing it from the official setlist.\n\nAlongside those listed album tracks, there's also several standalone and soundtrack songs that Taylor could add into the mix: 'Only The Young', 'I Heart?', 'Beautiful Eyes', 'Beautiful Ghosts'... And of course, 'Macavity' and 'Christmas Tree Farm'. (You never know!)\n\nThere's also the small possibility that she could potentially perform the songs she's featured on, like she did with Gracie Abrams on London Night 3, maybe even with special guests: 'The Joker and the Queen', 'Two Is Better Than One', 'Renegade', 'Both of Us', 'Gasoline', 'Birch', 'Highway Don’t Care' and 'The Alcott'.\n\nWhat surprise songs will Taylor Swift perform again?\n\nAt the start of the The Eras Tour, Taylor revealed that she had two rules when it comes to playing surprise songs more than once. Rule 1: If she messed up, she's allowed to play it again. Rule 2: Midnights songs are exempt and she can play them \"however many times I want...\"\n\nHowever, in February 2024, she confirmed that that rule is no longer in place. She will play whatever songs she wants, however many times she wants.\n\nSo, if you're going to a London show in August, or one of the final shows in Vancouver and you're hoping to hear 'You're On Your Own, Kid'?
