        "text": "Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is an incredibly broad genre, one that encompasses various common genres and sub-genres, each with their own mood, atmosphere, instruments, characteristics, and even tempo ranges.\n\nWhen it comes to tempo, the performance speed of a piece of music – that is, how fast or slow it is played – can have a tremendous impact on the vibe of a DJ mix. It can also influence how people respond to a DJ mix, and the style of EDM that they will most likely associate those songs with.\n\nFor this reason, it is important that you understand how tempo works, what the most common tempo ranges are for different styles of EDM, and how you can use the latest software for beat-matching in order to create the most seamless and cohesive DJ mix possible.\n\nTL;DR#\n\nBPM stands for Beats Per Minute;\n\nThe BPM of a song determines how many beats there are in a minute;\n\nDifferent styles of EDM have a different average BPM range, which influences how fast or slow a song in that particular style is played;\n\nUsing software like DJ.Studio can help DJs identify the BPM of a song, and then use AUTOMIX to instantly create more cohesive DJ mixes.\n\nWhat is BPM? And How Does it Relate to Electronic Dance Music?#\n\nBPM is a useful way to determine the performance speed of a piece of music. It stands for Beats Per Minute, and it helps composers, musicians, performers, and DJs quickly understand how fast or slow a piece of music is to be played.\n\nWithin the context of DJing, knowing the BPM of each song in your set will help you decide how easy (or difficult) it will be to transition from one song to the next. If the BPM of the songs in your set differ a lot, then you will struggle to create a cohesive DJ mix.\n\nTo understand how BPM actually works, it helps to have some knowledge of music theory. And while this knowledge is not essential to becoming a DJ, it can help make the process of creating DJ mixes a bit easier.\n\nWhen composing for sheet music, the music is split up into measures (or bars), which helps the performer (the one reading the sheet music) keep track of the tempo and their position in the song. The number of beats that occurs within a measure is defined by the time signature. The most common time signature is 4/4, where the top 4 is the number of beats per measure and the bottom 4 is the note that represents one beat.\n\nThe value of the BPM then determines the speed at which those beats are played out per measure. Which means, the higher the BPM, the faster those beats will occur, and vice-versa for lower BPMs.\n\nWhat is the Average BPM for EDM Genres?#\n\nAs mentioned at the start of this article, electronic music is an incredibly diverse genre. That means that it is possible for two very different sub-genres to exist under the same EDM umbrella.\n\nFrom the slow, sustained grooves of Dub music of the 1970s, to the mad, frenetic pace of Drum and Bass in the 1990s and beyond, they are all part of the EDM family. They just each have their own roots, history, influences, and notable artists, which have given each sub-genre their own distinct sound and flavor.\n\nWhen it comes to DJing, it is important to understand the common tempos for certain genres. This knowledge can help reduce the risk of trying to mix-and-match styles that don’t really work together, thus saving you precious time and hassle. So, without further ado, here is a breakdown of the common tempos for EDM genres and other genres.\n\nDub – 60 to 90 BPM\n\nDowntempo and Chillout – 80 to 110 BPM\n\nHip Hop - 85 to 110 BPM\n\nBreakbeat – 110 to 150 BPM\n\nHouse – 115 to 130 BPM\n\nTrance – 120 to 140 BPM\n\nTechno – 120 to 140 BPM\n\nFuture House - 120 to 130 BPM\n\nElectro House - 125 to 135 BPM\n\nTech House - 125 to 130 BPM\n\nHardstyle – 140 BPM to 160 BPM\n\nDrum and Bass – 165 to 180 BPM\n\nOf course, there are exceptions to these common tempos. It is possible for a song to fit a certain genre, but also be faster or slower than other top songs in that style. Some EDM songs even have a half time tempo, where the time signature of a song is cut in half. So instead of a track with 4/4 it would be cut down to 2/4.\n\nWith this in mind, consider these estimates as a useful reference point. But always use your best judgment when creating DJ mixes. You never know when you might find a track that is out of the ordinary, but also perfect for your DJ mix.\n\nHow to Match BPMs for Your DJ Mixes#\n\nNow that you know what BPM is, and the average BPM range for different dance music styles, it is time to put this knowledge into practice.\n\nBut what is the easiest, and most efficient way, to beat-match the right song in your set? Sure, you could manually calculate the BPM of each song. But that process can be very time consuming, especially if you are creating multiple DJ mixes, with up to 20 songs or more. One way to speed up the beat-matching process is to use software like DJ.Studio, which can help you save time and create more cohesive DJ mixes.\n\nWith DJ.Studio, you can import songs into your library and then use the Automix feature. When you click on Automix, DJ.Studio will automatically rearrange the order of your own tracks in your set. This will change the track order, so that only songs with the same or similar BPMs will be played together.\n\nTo demonstrate this feature, let’s say you have a DJ mix with 5 songs. And the order of these songs is as follows:\n\nRainbow (145 BPM)\n\nCloud (140 BPM)\n\nRain (142 BPM)\n\nThunder (148 BPM)\n\nSun (147 BPM)\n\nOnce you import these songs (in this order) into DJ.Studio, you can click on the Automix button.\n\nYou see that you can Lock First Track and Lock Last Track. If you tick either of these boxes, then DJ.Studio will keep the first and last tracks of your set in the same place while automixing. . This is a great feature to use if you have already decided what track you want to start and end your set with. Of course, you can always change the order of those tracks afterwards.\n\nBased on the configuration of our Automix, DJ.Studio will then rearrange the set order into something like this:\n\nRainbow (145 BPM)\n\nRain (142 BPM)\n\nCloud (140 BPM)\n\nThunder (147 BPM)\n\nSun (148 BPM)\n\nAs you can see, the Automix has calculated a new order of the tracks in your mix. You can also see that the songs 'Rainbow' and 'Sun' are in the same place, as they were locked. The only problem with this mix is that there is a noticeable jump in BPM between the songs 'Cloud' and 'Thunder.' To remedy this, DJ.Studio will scan your library and suggest a song with a more compatible BPM to replace it. You could also digitally adjust the BPM of the two songs."
