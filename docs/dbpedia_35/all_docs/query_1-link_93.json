        "text": "Songs you need to hear is CBC Music's weekly list of hot new Canadian tracks.\n\nFor this special edition, we're shining a light on some artists who have been made it on the 2024 CBC Searchlight Elite 50 list, as judged by music industry experts.\n\n'Badgirl Workout,' Omega Mighty feat. Taabu\n\nThe last year has been a big one for Omega Mighty: in October 2023 she released Notorious & Noble, the stellar followup to her debut album, which led to her first ever Juno nomination. \"Rush Dem,\" featuring Omega's sister, rapper Haviah Mighty, was nominated for reggae recording of the year, and now Omega's hoping to keep the ball rolling with a Searchlight win — and her song \"Badgirl Workout\" is a high-energy run for the crown. Joined by background dancers Jonna Abrams and Kayanna Aldred, the singer skillfully mixes R&B and dancehall rhythms for something you can dance, run or lunge to, while showcasing her deft vocals and powerhouse presence. Move over Jane Fonda, there's a new workout video in town. — Holly Gordon\n\n'What I Gotta Say,' Jr. Rhodes feat. Tea G\n\nI need your loving, what can I say\n\nIn every colour, you're the perfect shade.\n\nEdmonton's Jr. Rhodes and Tea G engage in an irresistible call-and-response while delivering those lines from the pre-chorus of this lyrical hip-hop song, all about celebrating \"the one.\" Jr. Rhodes cleverly draws on many subjects for his spitfire verses, especially music itself: \"If our love was like a song, it would never need a 'feat,'\" he declares in verse 2; \"Wish you could stay, 'cause I think you're the one/ But I can't entertain anything that ain't funk,\" he and Tea G sing in unison during the chorus — their latter assertion being confirmed by the song's soulful bassline, moody keyboard and driving, danceable beat. — Robert Rowat\n\n'Don't Stress,' Jaguar Sun\n\nJaguar Sun, the one-man project of Toronto multi-instrumentalist Chris Minielly, wants you to kiss your worries goodbye on this mellow, folksy number. \"Don't Stress\" begins with the buzzing hum of guitar before Minielly's vocals float in: \"I think you're right, don't stress it all.\" The track hums with optimism, yet Minielly's semi-brooding, talk-singing delivery creates a spark and gives the song a unique tension. Bursts of twinkling piano punctuate each verse, against the backdrop of a road trip gone awry: \"I think the van's dead, sun's set, hold it/ We'll get there in the end,\" he sings over a soft drum beat. Minielly's Searchlight entry is one of the singles from his EP, For You, which was released in March. — Natalie Harmsen\n\n'I Lied,' Housewife\n\nIt can be tricky to transition from friends to lovers, and Housewife's Brighid Fry doesn't deny that on \"I Lied.\" \"Always had this ability/ To make my own messes/ Turn friends to exes,\" she admits on the track's opening verse. But that doesn't stop her from baring her feelings over an irresistibly crunchy guitar riff, expertly produced by Derek Hoffman (Arkells, Ralph) and mixed by Lars Stalfors (Soccer Mommy, Matt and Kim). The result couches Fry's vulnerable lyrics inside a larger-than-life '90s-inspired anthem, urging her and listeners alike to break free of their lies and shout their true feelings out at the top of their lungs. — Melody Lau\n\n'Pray for You,' Mauvey\n\nChilliwack, B.C.-based artist Mauvey was born in Ghana and grew up between the U.K. and Canada, and his eclectic sound is a reflection of that cross-continental upbringing. The Afro-fusion artist merges traditional styles with pop, hip-hop and electronic music to create a genre-defying sonic landscape. A shortlist of his past collaborators provides a bit of insight into his exploratory style: electro-pop star Lights, drill rapper Temia and grungy rockers Dear Rouge. Fresh off a world tour and performances at Glastonbury and SXSW, he's now gunning to win Searchlight. His entry, \"Pray for You,\" is a chilled-out Afrobeats number full of lush percussion and soothing grooves, with an underlying message of rising above the haters. Mauvey goes from a melodic vocal delivery to subtle, but cutting, rapping: \"They were never really your friends/ Me, I wanna see you be happy/ They don't wanna see you make progress.\" The song shows off his dexterity as an artist, while also serving as reminder to know your worth so no one can take advantage of you. — Kelsey Adams"
