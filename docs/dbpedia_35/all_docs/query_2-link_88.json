        "text": "With nine riders in each team, plus dozens of support staff, the musical playlists on the bus each day can be pretty varied.\n\nAll you need is one teammate with a terrible taste in music and your entire morning is ruined. Velon went behind the scenes at the Tour de France to discover what everyone is listening to this year.\n\nTeam Sky's Wout Poels says Luke Rowe has the worst musical offerings, as Haddaway's seminal 1993 classic What is Love blared out on the bus. Rowe also outed Poels earlier in the Tour for playing the Crazy Frog song.\n\nTrek-Segafredo's Gregory Rast blasted the team's bus driver Dany for having the same music on for the past seven years, while Simon Geschke (Giant-Alpecin) says he has no time for the Ludvigsson brothers house music whenever they are on the bus.\n\nOrica-BikeExchange's Luke Durbridge revealed that Australian rock music was the flavour on their bus, except when Ruben Plaza gets on the decks and plays some of his Spanish hits.\n\nEach to their own, I guess."
