        "text": "Pop music, a popular music genre, is loved for its catchy rhythms that urge us to sing along and dance. Its lyrics, known for their repetitiveness, are easy to remember and sing along to, enhancing its appeal. Furthermore, pop music frequently explores universal themes, making it broadly relatable.\n\nIcons like Michael Jackson and Taylor Swift have significantly shaped this music genre, showcasing its ability to evolve while maintaining its core characteristics that fans cherish.\n\nâ€‹Pop music is a genre of popular music that is defined by its ability to produce hit songs with an energetic sound. The metropopolis genre is often associated with writing catchy tunes that are easy to remember and sing along to, featuring a good rhythm and memorable melody and lyrics. This style of music is defined by its ability to sound like multiple things at once without losing direction or key elements in transitions. Ultimately, the defining characteristic of pop music is its widespread popularity among listeners.\n\nPop music and popular music are two different types of music. Pop music often relies heavily on the production of the song and the hook for it to be successful, commonly featuring elements of dance music. It usually consists of catchy, upbeat melodies and instrumentals that can be easily heard on the radio or in dance clubs.\n\nPopular music, encompassing genres of popular music like art music, folk music, hip hop, and even jazz, is more dependent on trends within the music industry and what record companies are pushing out. For example, Michael Jackson was very popular in the 1980s due to his dance moves and catchy songs with big hooks that got stuck in people's heads.\n\nHowever, while pop songs have been created by songwriters since time immemorial, popular music has been around for much longer. Girl group songs have also become increasingly popular over recent years as they bring together female artists of various backgrounds who create an empowering sound.\n\nIn conclusion, while pop songs are created solely based on their catchiness and production value, popular songs rely more on their success within the music industry.
