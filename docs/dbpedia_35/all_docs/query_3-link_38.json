This genre has changed dramatically because of its appealing melodies and general popularity. Artists like Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande keep pushing the envelope by adding innovative sounds from genres including electronic and hip-hop.\n\nPop music originated in the 1950s when rock and roll first became known.

While modern D.J.s like Calvin Harris and David Guetta have brought E.D.M. to popular audiences, pioneering musicians like Daft Punk and The Chemical Brothers cleared the path.\n\nNotable E.D.M. musicians have transformed live presentations and ruled the charts.

Folk music lets listeners escape the fast-paced world and sink into the stories being recounted, offering a forum for thought and introspection.\n\nApart from nostalgia, folk music depends heavily on storytelling.

With its soulful melodies and sweet voices, R&B blends easily with Hip-Hop's rhythmic beats and lyrical flow. Along with generating top-notch singles, this mix has shaped the whole course of popular music.\n\nThe complementary character of R&B and Hip-Hop is one of the main factors ensuring the success of a mix of the two genres.
