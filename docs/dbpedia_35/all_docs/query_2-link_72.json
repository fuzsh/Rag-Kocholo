        "text": "Sonny73, you have been tried by your peers and found guilty of infiltrating our minds with the most annoyingly catchy tune in years.\n\nTo rescue your reputation, please furnish me with more information as to why on earth the Dutch chose this corner.\n\nTo start you on your study, I've copied this from the always-known-to-be-reliable source of Wikipedia.\n\n\"The Alpe has chaotic crowds of spectators. In 1999, Giuseppe Guerini won despite being knocked off by a spectator who stepped into his path to take a photograph. The 2004 individual time trial became chaotic when fans pushed riders toward the top. Attendance figures on the mountain have to be treated with caution. A million spectators were claimed for 1997. Eric Muller, the mayor of Alpe d'Huez, however, said there were 350,000 in 2001, four years later despite acceptance that the number rises every year. \"We expect more than 400,000 for the centenary race in 2003,\" he said.[7] The author Tim Moore wrote:\n\nAs a variant on a sporting theme, Alpe d'Huez annoys the purists but enthrals the broader public, like 20/20 cricket or nude volleyball. Last year, a full-blown tent-stamping riot had required heavy police intervention. During this year's clean-up operation, down in a ravine with the bottle shards and dented emulsion tins, a body turned up. He'd fallen off the mountain and no one had noticed. When the Tour goes up Alpe d'Huez, it's a squalid, manic and sometimes lethal shambles, and that's just the way they like it. It's the Glastonbury Festival for cycling fans.[8]\n\nAlpe d'Huez is the \"Dutch Mountain\", a Dutchman having won eight of the first 14 finishes. The writer Geoffrey Nicholson said:\n\nThe attraction of opposites draws them [Dutch spectators] from the Low Countries to the Alps each summer in any case. But all winter in the Netherlands coach companies offer two or three nights at Alpe d'Huez as a special feature of their alpine tours. And those Dutch families who don't come by coach, park their campers and pitch their tents along the narrow ledges beside the road like sea-birds nesting at St Kilda. The Dutch haven't adopted the Alpe d'Huez simply because it is sunny and agreeable, or even because the modern, funnel-shaped church, Notre Dame des Neiges, has a Dutch priest, Father Reuten (until a few years ago, it was used as a press room and was probably the only church in France where, for one day at least, there were ashtrays in the nave and a bar in the vestry, or where an organist was once asked to leave because he was disturbing the writers' concentration). No, what draws the Dutch to Alpe d'Huez is the remarkable run of success their riders have had there.\"[9]\n\nThe Dutch have won none of the last 13 stages, however; six have been won by Italians, three by Americans, twice by Spaniards, one by Fr√§nk Schleck of Luxembourg, and the most recent by French cyclist Pierre Rolland. [10]\"\n\nBlimey, they didn't notice a body in a ravine? Although I love the 'Glastonbury of cycle fans'.\n\n0"
