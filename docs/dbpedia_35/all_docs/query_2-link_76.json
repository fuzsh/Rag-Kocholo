Can anybody shed some light?\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeYPMddC_2E\n\nSorry, I forgot that sometimes Google can be your best friend . The tune is called \"Tomorrow\" by Billinger & Marsman feat. Jasper Vergeer. Nobody knew that in 2005 / 2006. Unfortunately, it was exclusively produced for this film and it is not available commercially."
