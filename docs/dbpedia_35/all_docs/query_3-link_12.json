        "text": "I listen to lots of electronic music, and I'm a professional DJ.\n\nElectronic music is a very diverse and complex music category, and have lots of genres and sub-genres. Electronic music producers usually try to transpose genre boundaries, and they usually produce songs contained in two or more equally important genres. For instance, a track can be contained in the genres \"house\" and \"techno\", or \"disco\", \"techno\" and \"acid\".\n\nAlso, it's really very common that electronic music artists collaborate with each other. Songs produced in collaboration do not belong to one single artist, but to two or more. In this case, it's not correct to say that one is the main artist, and the others are second artists (collaborators, composers remixes, or whatever) - they all detain the same equal authorship status over the composed track.\n\nThe problem with iTunes is that it supports one single genre, and one single artist per song. Sure, there's the album artist, but, again, that doesn't apply to albums where multiple artists participate with equal importance. And using \"V.A.\" or \"Various Artists\" in the song artist or album artist fields is ugly and useless - it doesn't say anything relevant.\n\nI know that Smart Playlists and Grouping features can help alleviate this deficiency, but they don't solve them at all. They're not elegant and complete solutions. If you browse the iTunes library, you will still see tracks as having only one genre and one artist, which is very frustrating.\n\nWhat I ask is really easy to implement. In fact, it wouldn't require to alter the existing ID3 and tag scheme. Just split artists and genres using a colon or semicolon character. For instance, in the \"Artist\" tag, iTunes can store the following:\n\n\"Christian Smith; Mark Broom; Renato Cohen\"\n\nand then, in the browser, iTunes could display \"Christian Smith\", \"Mark Broom\" and \"Renato Cohen\" as three distinct artists.\n\nThe same could be used for the \"Genre\" tag:\n\n\"Techno; House; Progressive\"\n\ncould be see, in the browser, as three different genres: \"Techno\", \"House\" and \"Progressive\".\n\nI've made an extensive web research, and I know that this deficiency doesn't annoy only me, but lots of other users. And it's a pretty old request too - dated from 2003.\n\nPlease, Apple, implement this feature. My huge electronic music collection really needs to be categorized into multiple artists and multiple genres.\n\nThank you.\n\nwhere do I start ed? First, this is a post about how rediculous it is that iTunes can't seem to give credit to multiple artists by allowing them equal standing on songs they have collaborated equally on, and how iTunes only allows for one genre per song, when if you know anything about music you will realize that a lot of it has multiple genres and artists. Second ed, you have done nothing but argue against this, and more specifically against all the users on this thread. No one wants to listen to you because you have nothing to bring to this thread but things like \"iTunes is not designed for a professional DJ. Its a consumer-grade freeware,\" \"Using a variable number of new tags does not strike me as any more elegant than putting a bunch of text in a single field,\" and \"I can assure you that most iTunes users will find that annoying,\" which no one cares about. This isn't for your oppinion of \"im against anything that doesn't love iTunes,\" this is for everyone agreeing and putting forward new ways to improve the thing known as iTunes. So if you can't say anything to improve the system and are just responding to everyone the negative way that you are, then get off this site cause no one will want you on their thread. Im sorry for doing exactly what you're doing, but someone has gotta call you out on it. Oh yeah, and don't bother responding to me like I know you will try, because this is the first time I have been on this site, and after seeing the way a \"level 6\" conducts himself on threads, this is my last.\n\nI understand your frustration with this. iTunes ***** for anybody who collects more then a few albums. I am an ameture DJ and I can't stand iTunes for music management. Before I recently began to use OSX, I used Mediamonkey 4 on Windows 7. This program does everything you are asking for and more. Just this week I found that someone had ported it to OSX using Wine. You can find it here. http://www.mediamonkey.com/addons/browse/item/mac-osx-mediamonkey/\n\nIt's not the prettiest of interfaces, but it's functionality is amazing. I've been using it to build playlists for DJ sets for years. It is constantly being improved. You will not be dissapointed. Just take the time to tag your music correctly then learn the power of autoplaylists and seperate libraries. I have s seperate library for my albums and one for my singles. I can create auto-playlists like \"Genre: House; Tech;/ Year; 2007 - 2011/ Mood: Upbeat/ Occasion: Warm-up; Driving; Peak/ Rating: >3.5 Stars\" or \"Genre: Rock; New Wave/ Year: 1978-1986/ Rating: >4 Stars\" etc. The options are limitless.\n\nNow they just have to mac a Mac OS version and all my prayers will be answered.\n\nbasically, if you delimit the artists names by a common symbol like ';' then all sorts of options open up. 1. the list could be setup to show multiple instances of the same song (not the most important thing). or more importantly 2. If I browse by artist, it wont list 3 separate artists as one artist or \"various\". In the artist browser, I could look up the song by any of the contributing artists without using the search function.\n\nThe same principe for genre is true. This technique has already established by J-Rivers media center for windows and it is a much more advanced system than itunes and is perfectly intuitive.\n\nDownload j-rivers media center and check it out... it leaves nothing to be desired except that it is not on the mac.\n\nFelipead, As you know, iTunes is not designed for a \"professional DJ.\" It is consumer-grade freeware.\n\niTunes only allows one genre, but you can make it as complicated as you like, depending on what information you wish to include. I have genres in my library that look like \"Funky/vocal/disco/club house,\" \"Uplifting/progressive trance,\" and \"Shoegaze/noise pop/pop/rock,\" and of course they will match on any of the words.\n\nThe multiple artists thing is a problem, and is in fact a subset of a bigger problem. Hip-hop fans would like the featured artist, classical fans would like the conductor, orchestra, and soloists, and so on. I cannot speculate why iTunes has not done more about this. But I would observe that iTunes is optimized for syncing iPods, most of which are real-estate limited to only display 3 fields (Artist, Title, Album) no matter how complicated you make the metadata for the tracks.\n\nIf you'd like to take one more kick at the can of feedback to Apple, you can do so here.\n\nEd\n\nFelipead, your post made me decide to send a suggestion to Apple and I decided to leave what I sent them here as well. I have made this template as a quick copy-paste deal so you guys can quickly submit this issue to Apple via their feedback page: http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html\n\nFeel free to edit this as needed, this was just a quick ten minute write up to get the point across to Apple. Please let Apple know that we demand these features in iTunes, wether you decide to use my template or your own.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"The problem with iTunes is that it supports one single genre, and one single artist per song.\" - A concerned user nicknamed felipead addressed this issue on your forums.\n\nIt's true, going through any iPod that hosts music under the Genres; Classical, Rap, Techno, House, Dubstep, and similar genres, is a nightmare. Having to deal with making playlists to accommodate listening to all songs featuring a certain artist without fiddling with iTunes or iPod controls.\n\nIt's unsettling seeing two or more artists listed for an artists when it could be solved by simply allowing users to tag featuring artists so it shows the song under multiple artists and genres. This would keep the fluid feel of your already great product. I find it more upsetting that Windows media player has had this feature for years already.\n\nWithout a doubt you have been sent requests for better support for songs with multiple genres and artists, and I feel it's self destruction to make devices that hold up to 40,000 songs, but have no support for better grouping of songs. It's really just too infuriating searching for this music, and having to have duplicate songs to accommodate this issue.\n\nI enjoy carrying my music library in it's entirety with me everywhere I go, but as an other non-DJ audiophile I demand these features for all the other audiophiles out there.\n\nLooking forward to your support,\n\n*YOUR NAME*\n\nFelipead's issue in this thread:\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3091571?start=0&tstart=0"
