        "text": "Justice fans rejoice. The French duo on Wednesday (Jan. 24) firmed up comeback rumors with the announcement that they’ll release release their fourth studio album, Hyperdrama, on April 26. The album will come via the group’s longstanding labels Ed Banger Records and Because Music. See the cover art for the LP — a take off of Justice’s classic cross symbol — below.\n\nThe duo — Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Augé — have also released the first two singles from the album. One is “One Night/All Night,” a sinewy, tough disco-influenced romp featuring vocals from Tame Impala‘s Kevin Parker.\n\n“We wanted this track to sound as if a dark/techno iteration of Justice had found a sample of a disco iteration of Kevin Parker,” de Rosnay and Augé say in a joint statement. “Kevin has a sense of melody that’s fascinating in the sense that he manages to write melodies that feel both simple and natural, but very peculiar at the same time. This song oscillates between pure electronic music and pure disco but you never really get the two at the same time.”\n\nThe pair offer some insight about what to expect from the album, saying, “This very idea of switching instantly from a genre to another within a song runs through the whole record, and is maybe showcased the clearest in ‘One Night/All Night.’”\n\nSee the song’s video — a sleek, pulsing voyage through the human body directed by Anton Tammi — above. This visual’s imagery informs the the album cover art, with Tammi envisioning “a journey inside the cross? … A strange and experimental object that looks like rave lighting inside human lungs and strobe light around a human heart.”\n\nThe other new song is “Generator” which fans will recognize as classic banging Justice fare. The duo call the track “like ‘Getaway’ by the Salsoul Orchestra, but with gabber and classic ’90s hardcore techno sounds. Disco/funk and electronic music at large have always been core elements of the music we make as Justice.\n\n“In Hyperdrama we make them coexist,” they add, “but not in a peaceful way.”\n\nJustice will launch a tour behind the album on April 12 at Coachella, where they’ll reveal their new live show. The tour will extend through August with dates in Mexico and Europe. The Coachella performances are currently the only U.S. shows on the schedule."
