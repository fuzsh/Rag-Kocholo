It will be like things never changed\n\nhttp://tourdetwit.com/ringtone.html\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IMjb6sU5Mg\n\nroll on the 7th when it hits Chelmsford!\n\nRe: TdF retro theme\n\nThis is an awesome find. I love it, reminds me of summer time-trials as a kid. Now I need to nip out and buy a pair of crocheted gloves, will be installing the mp3 on my 'phone directly.\n\nThe modern theme has been frenchified with that preposterous accordian motif. Not that I dislike French music, I just prefer Air to Sasha Distel.\n\nI also can't see how it is possible to say that the TdF stages in the Vosges or on the cobbles are boring. What was exciting about the 80's was working out exactly which riders were out of their mind on dope and speed without any testing.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nBorder Cycles Frontiera\n\nHechins Vade Mecum Model 6\n\nDispatches: Elswick Mistral, Coventry-Eagle, Raleigh Medale, Peugeot Premier (?), Coventry-Eagle Junior\n\nRe: Re:\n\nrusty bodie\":3v4fee47 said:\n\nthey should bring back cycling that was this exciting!!\n\ni'm totally bored watching the current tour already - all skinny, po-faced,\n\nanonymous riders with black plastic bikes, boring outifits, ugly oakleys, silly wheels . .i could go on and on and onnn.... :roll:\n\nYou watched the style of gutless sprinting the riders are doing in this years tour ??\n\nI have seen more exciting shits coming out of my arse :shock:"
