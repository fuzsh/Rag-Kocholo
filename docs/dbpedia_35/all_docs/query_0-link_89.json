Show this post\n\nI like their lyrics. I find most pop lyrics rely on embarrasingly bad symbolism and bad poetry. I generally shy away from lyrics all together, which is part of what got me into techno in the first place. But Kraftwerk take that bad/cheesy symbolism, and they reduce it to its most basic and literal form. Just like they were trying to make the most basic forms of pop by minimising the intruments and melodies. It is removed of all pretension and bs that is in so much other music.\n\nThe themes are obviously rooted in early futurism, but it fits with their production methods, and i'd still rather listen to Kraftwerk sing about computers than the Eagles sing about relationships with groupies.\n\nmy .02\n\nsherbert over 18 years ago\n\nThis post is hidden because you reported it for abuse. Show this post\n\nThe reason i raised this topic about Kraftwerks vocals/lyrics was not to be controversial but because we are all music lovers and i wanted to know other peoples opinions regarding this subject.I love Kraftwerk and i love music just like many of you but no artist is above constructive criticism.I agree the naive minimal, emotionless vocal delivery adds to the mechanical futuristic feel of certain tracks but when you realise how meticulous they were regarding each tracks production it`s like the words are an after thought \"oh that will do\".It`s like they fell into the \"verse chorus verse\" trap and didn`t have the vision to make purely instrumental electronic music like those they so influenced.Jean michel jarre a contemparary of theirs made Oxygene a ground breaking instrumental electronic album in 1975-76.Many of the subsequent producers realised you don`t need meaningless vocals to express emotions or subject matter the music says it all.All i`m trying to say is i wished they had made some instrumental versions.\n\nI do listen to vocal music as well as all the usual Detroit suspects,Eevolute,Black dog etc heres a couple of examples.\n\nRadiohead,Soft cell,Nina simone,Bill withers,Dusty springfield,Lonnie liston smith,sinatra,stones....\n\nkompressorkanonen over 18 years ago\n\nThis post is hidden because you reported it for abuse. Show this post\n\nVerse-chorus-verse doesn't have to be a trap. It's the formula for pop music, and Kraftwerk were a pop band. (\"Autobahn\" was written as a slightly tongue-in-cheek teutonified homage to Beach Boys, remember!) OK they were a pioneering electronic pop band, sure, but a pop band nonetheless. If you took the vocals out, it would feel like instrumental versions of italo disco - i.e. like something is missing; you'd be left with a bunch of well-made backing tracks with a lot of the wit and suss taken out of them IMO. And they'd never have been as influential as they became.\n\nSome of their lyrics might at first glance seem like random nonsense, but they're actually just as carefully put together as the music. There are no coincidental or thoughtless elements on a Kraftwerk album. Whether you like it or not is down to personal preferences, but everything is supposed to be there exactly the way it is, and has been subjected to an extremely thorough elimination process. The hooks and pop elements are necessary parts of their music IMO. And \"Metal On Metal\" is a very good instrumental track which points the way forward to a lot of the stuff us folks love.\n\nshmoo - if you don't like the \"Computer World\" or \"Man Machine\" albums, which I think are their best (\"TEE\" is on 3rd place for me), I think it's safe to say that you're unlikely to ever dig this band. Check their last one (TDF Soundtracks) for a pretty good current-sounding techno-inspired album which doesn't sound much like their old stuff.\n\nAnonymous over 18 years ago\n\nThis post is hidden because you reported it for abuse. Show this post\n\nThanks for sharing the knowledge KK. I found some soundclips of Computer World and i must admit i liked what i heard alot more than i thought i would. The vocals weren't my cup of tea to be honest but they didn't bother me too much either. I like Sigur Ros and i haven't a clue what he's singing about so i don't mind about things like that too much as long as it has some sort of cohesion with the music. Even from the short clips i heard i could see why people say they are such an important influence in Electronic Music. I think i'll buy a copy on CD, something i feel i should do really. Pay my respects to the pioneers sort of thing. Cheers\n\nsherbert over 18 years ago\n\nThis post is hidden because you reported it for abuse.

Show this post\n\nNow this is fun.. Sometimes; of course, the vocals get me. But, they were a pop band. Listening to them from that perspective. It makes total sense for them to sing about fun on the autobahn. They took their schtick and rode it on down the line and wrote beautiful songs about it.\n\nAlso through language they made completely otherworldy sounds which I am sure are the very elements that knocked many a person whom we love now off their nut and into the studio. Computer World should be just about enough to settle the use of voices and vocals once and for all.\n\nEich me son sche\n\nuno dos tres quatro\n\nThe vocals to a large degree are necessary for the songs to function. They were commenting on the world through the pop music structure in a very cold, detached and biting way.\n\nThey were German. Remember that. Not many others could do what they did and pull it off.\n\nTo flip it on its ear El Baile Alemán\n\nWhere Kraftwerk gets horribly and strangely translated into something very new and even more of a biting social commentary.\n\nAlso by a German.\n\ntracerfirefm over 18 years ago\n\nThis post is hidden because you reported it for abuse.

Show this post\n\nBoth were artists in their own right with completely needs and different tactics for what they needed to do. KLF; Their stuff is Splenda compared to Kraftwerk. So sweet, so good those first 30 times then they are absolutely revolting. They knowingly took the piss out of what they were doing much like Kraftwerk but the KLF were never for a minute, funky. Their music was big and over the top Motley Crue Girls Girls Girls and it was Stadium sized exactly like they were intended to be, just like their book set out. I agree their remixes made their material more worth listening to in the long run but it's different breeds. And to me KLF are more like the toy breed variety. Cute, but you really want to punt them into the wall cos they get annoying and that cute bark turns into an annoying shrill piercing yap. They both make for good commentary within music, but for very different reasons. Both absurd, but that's where they part ways. British absurdity is nothing compared to German absurdity.\n\nWait. What Time is Love essential? Oh god no. Not even close. Important maybe and they did in their own way push down doors and break boundaries (mostly legal) and stand out amongst the artists of their time for mostly media related reasons. They came, and they went. Really though. The sports fans can have them and I'm fine that if the next time I hear it is on the tv during a football (Amerikan) game. What time is love is like the Super Bowl compared to Tour De France. It's spectacle and nothing but. It needed a remix to be like a post game blow off. Tour de France needed a remix so you could double it up and stretch out the perfection and bug out like a good long hill and high speed."
