        "text": "Electronic music is music that is made with electronic musical instruments, digital instruments, computers, or other music technology. It is comprised of both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). It also includes any music involving electronic processing, such as recording and editing on tape, and whose reproduction involves the use of loudspeakers. Because of the ubiquitous nature of electronic music, and the influence and prevalence of digital processing in contemporary music, it has grown increasingly difficult to define what electronic music is. Jazz music, long considered an acoustic genre, has incorporated electronic instruments like electric pianos and electric basses for years. Most music is recorded and processed on what is called digital audio workstations, making most contemporary music digitally processed.\n\nNow that it's been established that any kind of music can feature electronic instruments or be processed through digital means, the question still remains: what is electronic music? Electronic music refers both to the method and means by which the music is produced, but also the genre of music and the historical context in which the music is created. Music genres like hip-hop, techno, and house music have traditionally been made solely through electronic means. So intention is just as important as creation. For instance, as a jazz musician composes music to be played by a quartet, or a classical musician creates music for a symphony, an electronic musician creates music using electronic instruments within an pre-established electronic framework.\n\nElectronic music first emerged at the end of the 19th century with what came to be the predecessor to modern-day synthesizers. During the 1920s and 1930s, electronic instruments began to be incorporated into compositions and performances shortly after they were invented. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape was introduced. Magnetic tape was special in that it allowed musicians to record sounds and change them by changing the tape speed, direction, and pitch. Subsequently, in France and Egypt, these innovations led to the emergence of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s. Musique concrete, created in Paris in 1948, was based on splicing together recorded fragments and tape loops of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s. Computers using algorithms to create music emerged during the same time.\n\nDuring the 1960s, digital computer music came to the forefront. Advancements in live electronics made their way to consumers and musicians, spearheaded by Japanese electronic music companies. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and Japanese drum machines were incorporated into popular music and electronic music became more prevalent in the music industry. The emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop and EDM, all created through electronic means, made electronic music a household name. In the early 1980s mass-produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. During the 1990s, music technology became more affordable and electronic music production became standardized, both in the industry and the marketplace.\n\nAkai MPC 2000XL sampler and drum machine.\n\nThe first person to successfully create sounds using electronic equipment was an American named Thaddeus Cahill. Cahill assembled rotary generators and telephone receivers and figured out a way to convert electrical signals into sound. Cahill dubbed it the telharmonium. He started to build it around 1895 and made various improvements to it over the years. Because amplifiers and speakers had not been invented yet, the device was not able to produce sounds with any magnitude. Regardless, Cahill had the right idea. Essentially Cahill had created the forerunner to modern-day synthesizers.\n\nThe Italian Futurist painter Luigi Russolo was another visionary. After building several experimental musical instruments called Intonatumori, he wrote a treatise on the creation of new instruments in a manifesto called \"The Art of Noises\" in 1913. Often regarded as one of the first noise music experimental composers, he performed several concerts of \"noise music\" concerts in 1913 to 1914 and in Paris in 1921. Unfortunately, Russolo's innovative instruments and most of his compositions apparently vanished during the tumult of World War II.\n\nThe history of modern electronic music begins with the introduction of tape, as both a medium and a creative tool. The tape recorder was invented in the 1950s and immediately became a new and exciting musical instrument. Because of early support from European governments, which helped fund initial experiments into tape, as well as helped establish early recording studios, Europeans were among the first to work in the medium. In 1948 two French composers, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry, and their colleagues at Radiodiffusion-Television Francaise in Paris, started to produce tape collages by cutting small sections of tape and combining them. The result created a collage-like soundscape which they called musique concrete. This small group of innovators are responsible for developing the foundation for tape and sound manipulation and modern day music sampling. These techniques, in some form or fashion, have been used by artists from Miles Davis to Public Enemy. Some of these innovations included speed alteration, playing tapes backward, and signal feedback loops.\n\nTape music eventually led to other composers developing different techniques, but these were students of classical music who approached composition from a European perspective. In regards to what we now know as electronic music, its development cannot be discussed without examining the nightclubs and discotheques in Europe and the United States. Electronic instruments such as synthesizers had already been incorporated into popular music through genres like jazz fusion, and more popularly disco. Disco during the 1970s was a cultural phenomenon, launching a global dance culture that found people all over the world crowding into their favorite clubs every weekend. As disco began to decline in the United States in the late 70s, it still maintained a high level of popularity in Europe. In Italy in particular, a new scene of Italian DJs (disc jockeys) started making their own disco-inspired records. Italo disco, as it came to be known, often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco's instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes commonly deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three, like in the song \"Robot Is Systematic\" by 'Lectric Workers and \"Spacer Woman\" by Charlie.\n\nYamaha DX7 synthesizer.\n\nDiscussing the history of modern electronic dance music (EDM) must first involve a look at the German band Kraftwerk. Kraftwerk is a German band started in Dusseldorf in 1969 by Ralf Hutter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of electronic music, Kraftwerk was among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation which included synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. Kraftwerk was a huge inspiration for hip-hop music, and their single \"Trans-Europe Express\" served as the inspiration behind the seminal hip-hop/electro song \"Planet Rock\" by Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force. Then in the early 1980s, Chicago radio jocks The Hot Mix 5 along with club DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles played various styles of dance music. These included older disco records; electro funk; newer Italo disco; B-Boy hip-hop music by Man Parrish, Jellybean Benitez, Arthur Baker, and John Robie; and electronic pop music by Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Some made and played their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape, sometimes mixing in effects, drum machines, and other rhythmic electronic instrumentation.\n\nAs electronic music was at first solely designed for nightclubs, these places became where electronic music got its wings. In places like Paris, Rome, and New York City in particular, nightclubs were where electronic records were field tested for an eager public. Between 1977 and 1987, the Paradise Garage was one of the most important and influential clubs in New York City with a devoted patronage comprised of sexual and ethnic minorities (primarily African-American gay men). With resident DJ Larry Levan and other DJs as the center of attention, it influenced dance, music, and culture both nationally and internationally as the birthplace of the modern nightclub.\n\nWhat Is Electronic Music?\n\nElectronic music is everywhere in 21st century America. It can be found in massive, multi-day festivals like the Electric Daisy Carnival, on top-40 radio, and in a myriad of commercials. Electronic music has a complex history that spans everything from obscure avant-garde art music to glittering disco ballrooms.\n\nElectronic music is exactly what the name suggests: music made with electronic instruments. The category of electronic music can best be understood in contrast to the categories of acoustic or traditional music, like classical, jazz, or folk. However, because musical traditions like classical, jazz, and folk are frequently recorded using digital technology, amplified using microphones, and distributed over the internet, it may be difficult to distinguish the distinction between electronic and non-electronic music in the 21st century.\n\nWith this in mind, we can understand the concept of electronic music as emerging out of the 20th century's remarkable revolutions in computing, electronics, and digital technology. Throughout the 20th century, pioneering engineers, inventors, and musicians built machines that could produce music in ways that had previously been unimaginable.\n\nEarly Electronic Music\n\nThe Russian musician and inventor Leon Theremin invented the theremin in 1920. The theremin is an instrument that creates electromagnetic fields that create sounds at different pitches when the musician moves his or her hands around the theremin. Theremins create a high, warbling sound most famous for its use in 1950s horror and science fiction movies.\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, numerous inventors developed different versions of what would come to be the synthesizer. These electronic instruments were originally intended to mimic the sounds of organs or other traditional instruments but would soon come to be seen as unique music-making tools in their own right. The avant-garde musical movement known as musique concréte used electronic instruments during the 1940s in a way that would be very influential to later styles of electronic music.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the highly creative Canadian musician Bruce Haack started making electronic music that was originally intended for children, appearing several times on the Mr. Roger's Neighborhood TV program with his various gadgets. In the 1960s Robert Moog began producing his famous line of synthesizers that would revolutionize the field of electronic music. Moog synthesizers are still widely used today.\n\nMusical Machines & the Birth of Disco\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, electronic music enjoyed an explosion of creativity, technological advancement, and popularity. This period of advancement would in many ways mirror the technological advancements in other branches of technology like personal computers and video games. After relocating to Germany, the Italian-born musician Giorgio Moroder became a deeply influential proponent of what would become electronic dance music, in particular the subgenre known as Italo disco. Germany was a hot bed of musical experimentalism during the late 1960s and early 1970s, particularly in the field of electronic music. Groups like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can, and Suicide used synthesizers and other electronic instruments to transform rock music into new forms, inspiring many people across the world to experiment with electronic music.\n\nAs the ethnographer and cultural theorist Sarah Thornton has observed, the space in which electronic music was experienced by fans in the 1970s was just as important as the music itself. The discotheque, later shortened to disco, was a place where new electronic dance records were played by a DJ and fans could dance to the music. This was a space freed from the constraints and expenses of having a live band where technology reigned supreme. These dance-centered environments were the forerunner of what would become rave culture and club culture.\n\nBy the mid 1970s, disco music was enjoying a peak period of popularity. Electronic synthesizers were combined with drum machines to create a dance-friendly style of music that gained popularity throughout the world. The European version, spearheaded by Giorgio Moroder, was very futuristic sounding and synthesizer-based. The American version of disco was much more rooted in funk, soul, and other African-American genres. In the United States, disco experienced a sudden drop in popularity in the early 1980s fueled, as some have argued, by homophobia and racism."
