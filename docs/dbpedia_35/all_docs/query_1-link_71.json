        "text": "Electronic music has of course a rather longer history than J-M Jarre, Walter/Wendy Carlos et al. Perhaps the most obvious place to start is the work of Stockhausen, who was producing major works of electronic music back in the 1950s. Personally I can't stand the stuff (it's not based on normal musical scales and I can't discern any sort of beauty in it), so I'm afraid recommended recordings, etc, are not something I could address.\n\nThe earliest pioneers of pop electronic music is arguably Walter/Wendy Carlos [in case you're wondering why I call the composer this - he started life as Walter Carlos, under which name he originally recorded Switched on Bach, and then changed sex at a later date]. Carlos's fame is really in that he showed that the then-new Moog synthesiser could be used for 'serious' music. The album to have is Switched on Bach. Note that there are two versions - the original and a newer version made for Telarc. Both are okay. Some of the other albums (The Well-Tempered Synthesiser, the Brandenburg Concerti, etc) are a matter of personal taste - some find them insightful, others rather kitsch (however, almost everyone likes the music he did for Clockwork Orange - again be aware that the original soundtrack album contains a lot of stuff which isn't Carlos's stuff). I'd advise listening before you buy. One slightly unusual piece by Carlos is worth checking out. It's a double album called Sonic Seasonings. It's what might be called the first ambient album, mixing synthsiser noises and melodies with natural sounds. Again, listen before buying.\n\nA few years after Switched on Bach, Jean-Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream opened up a new avenue in electronic pop. Until then, synthesiser music had sounded fairly 'clean-cut' (and ideal for composers like Bach), but they created much richer textures. Jarre's music is solidly aimed at accessible AOR (no sin in this, of course, unless you're a teenager with a closed mind), whereas TD were more experimental, and much of their music is the result of free-form improvisation. I've seen Jarre and TD in concert, and both were interesting, but curiously, both left me emotionally unmoved.\n\nKraftwerk are perhaps *the* greatest exponents of electronic pop and I seriously believe they are the equal of the Beatles in their own way. Any electronic dance music which has followed is a footnote on their work. Black American groups adopted the ideas to a black music idiom, but at heart it's still the basic format that Kraftwerk established. All their work from Autobahn onwards is brilliant, and if you've not encountered their stuff, then listen to the albums in chronological order (be sure to get hold of 'Tour de France', a single which was never incorporated into an album).\n\nAn honourable mention should be made for Yellow Magic Orchestra, a Japanese group (including Ryuichi Sakamoto) who were highly influential on 80s electro-pop bands. Certainly their influence was far greater than their record sales in the West.\n\nIn spite of this eulogy, I must confess that I'm not hugely keen on the electro music of the last decade or so. Several reasons:\n\n(a) melody was sacrificed for repetitious four to the floor beats (I know this is ideal for dancing, but it's crap to listen to)\n\n(b) am I the only one who thinks that repeating the same verbal phrase again and again in a song is annoying rather than hypnotic?\n\n(c) I really don't like black music, and most electro music these days is based on it. Please don't impute a racist comment in this - I just don't like the harmonic progressions used in most black music, pure and simple.\n\nThe only even vaguely modern electro group I like are the Pet Shop Boys, who are I guess a lot more famous in Europe than in the USA.\n\nnice post andrew!\n\ni love electronic music! everything from 80's to ambient to techno. if it involves a keyboard, i'm all for it. i have to give all the credit to the first a flock of seagulls album - my sister hated it and gave me her cassette! i was hooked!\n\nmy random thoughts on the world of electronica:\n\ni must agree that kraftwerk were true pioneers - the stuff the did was so innovative, especially for their time. i can still listen to tour de france over and over.\n\ni'm also a pretty big fan of yello - they have the same innovative feel as kraftwerk, but the musical style is very different. forget oh yeah...they have lots of better songs.\n\nmy all time favorite is depeche mode - nobody does it better. although they ventured into the world of analog (i still remember crackin' up with my friends when they busted out with a guitar and drum-set on the stage) i still consider them the electronic kings! give \"violator\" a whirl...you won't be disappointed.\n\nlest we forget new order - my second favorite group of all time. not really sure if you can call them electronic though...although \"low life\" is pretty electronicky.\n\nhow about saint etienne? definitely electonic based. very soothing female vocal lead. their best-of is a great place to start, otherwise check out \"foxbase alpha\" - their best album.\n\nfor more up-tempo stuff, all the usual suspects apply: underworld (\"second toughest in the infants\"), the crystal method (\"vegas\"), chemical brothers (\"surrender\"); the orb, bt, etc. all great artists for that genre\n\ni'm sure there's more i could post, but you get the picture.\n\ni do agree that some of todays stuff is too repetitive. i've got some song where the first three minutes is all the same, slow-building, looped sample. ugh!\n\nit's so overdone that it really takes something special to make it stand out."
