        "text": "The Tour de France is an epic endurance event comprised of miles and miles of perseverance and dedication with a series of high-intensity breakaways, break-throughs and bursts of energy. Just like life, it can be a struggle but the one who can push the hardest and recover the quickest will win.\n\nNo matter your experience in the saddle, indoor cycling is a good and safe way to prep you for any outdoor route. When riding inside, you can focus on your form, teach your body proper alignment, and discover how to generate maximum power.\n\nInside, you make your engine (your legs, lungs and heart) stronger for the outside ride. The muscles that you recruit in your legs are your quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes. Most people tend to be quad-dominant however it is most efficient and effective to balance all three equally. Meanwhile, the upper body should be relaxed and primarily used for balance (and steering outside).\n\nPutting it all together — and getting comfortable pushing your body through the tough stretches — can be tough. But scientific studies have proven music to be performance enhancing in sports, and it’s extremely important in studio cycling for an extra boost of motivation.\n\n“I am meticulous about finding songs that will pump you up as well as sync rhythmically to the RPM (revolutions per minute), says DailyBurn trainer Justin Rubin. [NOTE: BPM or beats per minute = 1/2 of the RPM] “When I teach I tell my class, ‘Don’t apologize for riding in rhythm, it’s the same workout either way, but this way is more fun…and with a little extra swagger!’”\n\nRubin notes that inspiring music is all around us. “I gather my music from every day life, in movies, commercials, the gym, Spotify, iTunes, social media, etc,” he says. “I like to have a balance of current and throw back, hip-hop and dance, house and rock. As a musician myself, (bass player raised in New Orleans) I listen to the beat and energy first and then notice the singer and lyrics second.” His playlists tend to gravitate towards positive energy, fun remixes and motivating beats that can create a moving meditation.\n\nHere’s Justin’s playlist for this week, in honor of the final days of the Tour. “I hope it makes your cycling fun and effective,” he says.\n\nWorkout Playlist: Tour de France Cycling Mix\n\nGood Life by One Republic\n\nRPM: 95 (BPM is twice RPM), warm-up\n\nRebel Beat by The Goo Goo Dolls\n\nRPM: 80-85, jog\n\nBailando by Enrique Inglesias\n\nRPM: 85-90, we’re adding wind resistance\n\nSomething Bigger, Something Better by Amanda Blank\n\nRPM: 70, begin climbing hill one, steady patient climb (song 1 of 3 for hill climb)\n\nRadioactive- The Dirty Tees Mix by Imagine Dragons Mix\n\nRPM: 65, continue on the hill, add a little resistance, 2 1-minute breakaways (pedal faster) (song 2 of 3 for hill climb)\n\nThis Is What It Feels Like by Armin van Buuren\n\nRPM: 65, second half first hill, break away to the top for 60 seconds; therefore first hill has 3 1-minute breakaways (song 3 of 3 for hill climb)\n\nBack That Thang Up by Juvenile\n\nRPM: 100 in rhythm, active recovery at the top of the hill, “celebration station” —“Life is full of struggles and celebrations,” says Rubin. “We struggled to the top of that hill and now we celebrate.”\n\nHouse Tabata by Tabata Songs\n\nRPM: 95, 20-second intervals followed by 10-second recovery, wind sprints\n\nWhen Love Takes Over by David Guetta\n\nRPM: 65, start of next hill, steady patient climb, 3 minutes (song 1 of 2 for hill climb)\n\nI Need Your Love by Calvin Harris\n\nRPM: 65, 2 1-minute break away to the top (song 2 of 2 for hill climb)\n\nBeautiful Pain by Eminem\n\nRPM: 85, active recovery 30 seconds, 3-minute jog\n\nAnimals- Summer Remix by Hadon Sky\n\nRPM: 65, final hill, game face on, climb for 3 minutes (song 1 of 2 for hill climb)\n\nSummer by Calvin Harris\n\nRPM: 65, final song, final climb, three 30-second breakaways to the top and the finish line (song 2 of 2 for hill climb)\n\nKings and Queens (acoustic version, unplugged) by Thirty Seconds to Mars\n\nEasy pedaling with little to no resistance, recovery, bring heart rate down"
