        "text": "8/10\n\nThroughout the last few years, Rian Peters's IAMTHELIVING project has been seen as one of the more progressive to have emerged recently. Now based out of Vancouver, the Londoner's sound has always looked to project a vibrant and soulful aura, while always paying homage to the more driven aesthetics within R&B as well. And after what has already been an extremely prolific year for him, he is capping it off with the shimmering new EP 'Nebra Sky, Pt. 1', a release brimming with fresh and inspired ingenuity throughout.\n\nMuch like what we have come to expect from him these last few years, 'Nebra Sky, Pt. 1' is both a nod to the classic soul sound, but with this forward-thinking edge to it. Blending a heady mix of retro-inspired instrumentation with a bright and soaring production at every turn, this new seven-track collection makes for a beautifully warm and embracing listen, all wrapped up in his rich and spellbinding vocal performance.\n\nThese last few months have certainly been littered with some of his most endearing work to date, but hearing it all under one roof really heightens his adventurous ways of late. With such a broad and immersive flow to his newest material, 'Nebra Sky, Pt. 1' is a strong and powerful return from one of the scene's more exciting names on the rise."
