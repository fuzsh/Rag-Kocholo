        "text": "Meet Dr. Amanda Peters\n\nI love being able to help people live without pain and be the best version of themselves.”\n\nAn Early Interest in All Things Health\n\nDr. Amanda’s passion for healing began early in life, with a fascination of how living things work. She was raised with anatomy pop-up books and the PBS TV show “Slim Goodbody.” She excelled in science classes at Watauga High School, then earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology at Appalachian State University and a minor in Chemistry.\n\nThen, Dr. Amanda moved onto the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she managed a federally funded research laboratory studying cell physiology, neurobiology, and embryology in the Neurosciences Research Center, and was co-author of publications in primary research journals such as PNAS.\n\nOutside of the Office\n\nDr. Amanda and massage therapist Justin Keiler met in Boone and have been married since 1996. Their teen son Michael is a budding artist and attends Caldwell Community College and sells his art at local markets from his studio, Sally Cat Art. They have a daughter named Sabine who is a local grocery store manager. They are proud grandparents of an elementary school boy named Westley. Dr. Amanda is fascinated by science, biology and how the body works, constantly working to understand how the body works and how to optimize it’s function.\n\nIn her spare time, Dr. Amanda likes to read fantasy novels, play video games and table-top Role Playing Games such as D&D, hike and take nature photographs of our beautiful High Country. She also volunteers for the local chapter of the non-profit group Free Mom Hugs.\n\nCall Today\n\nContact Willow Health and Wellness now to set up your first appointment!\n\nDr. Amanda Peters | (828) 832-6632"
