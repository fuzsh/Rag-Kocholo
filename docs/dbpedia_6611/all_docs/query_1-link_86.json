        "text": "Source: History of Sabine Parish, Louisiana, From the First Explorers and Settlers to the Present, by John G. Belisle,\n\nThe Sabine Banner Press, 1912;\n\ntranscribed by Genealogy Trails Transcription Team.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES\n\nARMSTRONG, DR. J. C.\n\nThe subject or this sketch is entitled to honorable mention in any history of Sabine parish, for the reason that it can be said of him as truthfully as of any one that he lived and labored for the good of its people rather than for wealth or personal aggrandizement. He was born in Dallas County, Ala., and came to this parish on or about 1850, where he lived until his death in 1896. This parish was, consequently, the scene of his labors for over forty years. While he was a popular and successful physician, and always did a large practice, all he got, or wished to get out of it, seemingly, was a very modest living. The poor and needy, especially, had cause to revere the name of Dr. Crit Armstrong, who guarded and frequently saved their lives, and did so, as often as other wise, \"without money and without price.\" It was said of the knightly Bayard, the beau-ideal of the age of chivalry, that he always exhibited an utter disregard for money and financial matters. This was pretty much the case with Dr. Crit Armstrong, our good and true knight of the scalpel, whose tender heart was as well known as his majestic figure to the people of every section of this parish. At one time Dr. Armstrong had the remarkable experience of being elected Parish Judge, without having any special knowledge of law or of court proceedings. Being well supplied with sound sense, however, he filled the position to the satisfaction of the people. But on one occasion there was a great tumult in his court. Two irate attorneys were apparently thirsting for each other's gore; the crippled clerk was tossed aside and the sheriff was unable to quell the uproar, until the judge from the bench gave the remarkable order to \"let 'em light,\" which had the effect of quieting the disturbers, as fighting was really the last thing the blustering attorneys wished to do. At this day and time, when love of money is properly regarded as the root of so many evils it is refreshing to contemplate a character with whom generosity and all kindly impulses were unaffected by sordid considerations, and whose moral and physical strength and breadth of brawn enabled him to exemplify such principles throughout his course. The grave of old Dr. Crit, in the cemetery at Many, is entitled to reverence as that of the kindliest fathers of our people and our parish.\n\nASHBY, A. D.\n\nMr. Ashby is a member of the Parish School Board from Ward Seven. He was born in Itawamba County, Miss., and lived there until 18 years of age, receiving such education as the small rural schools afforded, which was very limited. He came to Sabine parish in 1899 and resided here ever since. On March 9, 1910, he was married to Miss Mattie Bruce. Mr. Ashby's principal occupation has been farming, but in 1910 he entered the ministry of the Congregational Methodist church, with which denomination he is prominently identified. His chief regret is that he was unable to finish his education. In 1912 he was elected member of the Parish School Board and at the organization of the new board he was elected chaplain of that body, being the first man ever honored with that position. Mr. Ashby has always been an advocate of a modern educational system that would thoroughly fit the youths of the parish for the battle of life and the attainment of a more ideal citizenship, and his influence will be cast with all progressive movements for the public weal.\n\nARMSTRONG, T. C.\n\nT. C. Armstrong (Attorney-at-Law) - This gentleman was born in Sabine parish on October 18, 1857, and is consequently in the 56th year of his age. His birthplace was in the San Miguel neighborhood, in the northern portion of the parish. His father was William Hamilton Armstrong, who died when quite young and when Thomas, his only child, was a baby. Hamilton Armstrong, though young, was a teacher of high repute, to whom some of our old citizens, his former pupils, still refer with much respect and pride. He was equally known as a marksman and hunter.\n\nThomas' grandfather, on his father's side, was James H. Armstrong, who came to this parish or its vicinity in 1847, from Kentucky, originally, by way of Alabama. His grandfather, on his mother's side, was William D. Stephens, who came to this section of the state in 1835, before the organization of this parish, from Virginia, originally, by way of Tennessee and Ohio. In his boyhood \"Little Thomas\" attended the ordinary old-field schools of the San Miguel neighborhood, and the somewhat superior one at Old Pleasant Hill. In 1875 he entered Emery and Henry College in Southwest Virginia, where he graduated in 1878. While at the old-field schools referred to, he exhibited considerable precocity, so to speak, and when he graduated at college he pocketed the first honor of his class. He studied law at home in Sabine parish, and in New Orleans at the Law Department of the University of Louisiana, and was admitted to the bar in 1882. On beginning his professional life, instead of hunting a location more suitable for a lively career, he remained at home without regard to consequences. Up to this time, these have not been as serious as might have been expected. He ranks well in our cotorie of able and conscientious attorneys, has an interesting family, a pleasant home at Sodus and another residence at Many; and, at last accounts, a sufficiency of the necessaries of life. While he has been rather slow about completing an ambitious and patriotic literary task, commenced some time ago, we would hesitate to call him \"Le Faineaut,\" as we are not certain what he has up his sleeve. While he has not entered the arena of politics, he may do so (as this notice is not intended as his obituary), and may have good prospects in that direction.\n\nANTONY, MARION S.\n\nThe subject of this sketch is a citizen of Ward Two, and is now serving as constable of that ward. His grandfather was Christopher Antony, a pioneer of the Negreet community who came to this country in 1822 from Virginia by way of Kentucky and Texas. Christopher's father was Martin Antony, who was a native of Germany, and he and his eldest son, Jacob, were soldiers in the American army during the revolutionary war. William M. Antony, father of Marion S., was born at Negreet in 1827, being the eldest of a family of eight sons and two daughters, and in 1851 was married to Mary Alice, daughter of Aaron L. and Penelope Neil, to which union were born ten children, those now living being Thomas R., George C., Marion S., Charles W. and Mary E., wife of J. C. Salter. William M. Antony served his country in the war between the states, and his parish in various civil capacities and was a well-to-do and esteemed citizen.\n\nARMSTRONG, DR. REZIN LAURENCE\n\nDr. Rezin Laurence Armstrong was born in Dallas County, Ala., on December 30, 1821, and died at Pleasant Hill, this parish, January 4, 1899. He was of Scotch-Irish descent, and a worthy son of sturdy and heroic sires. Tradition relates that his great-grandfather was burned at the stake by savages in some portion of what was then referred to as \"the wilderness of the West.\" His grandfather, William Armstrong, was a pioneer and Indian fighter of Christian County, Kentucky, who made the savages pay dearly for the murder of his sire. The father of Dr. Laurence moved to Sabine parish in 1847, and from that time until his death the doctor practiced his profession in the vicinity of Pleasant Hill and was a prominent figure in the community for more than half a century. In his youth, while still a resident of Alabama, he graduated in medicine at the New Orleans Medical College, a prototype of their present Tulane University. Soon after wards, on February 27, 1845, he married his first wife, Cynthia Reed. Of the several children of that marriage, Dr. R. L. Armstrong, Jr., of Pleasant Hill is the only survivor. On August 5, 1858, Dr. Armstrong married Virginia A. Pullen, his second wife and surviving widow. Too modest and unselfish for a politician, the only public position that he ever occupied was that of state senator. Besides standing, as it were, a monument of incorruptible integrity and spotless honor, he was equally distinguished for the greater and softer impulses of the heart, for open-handed liberality and above all his true charity. Upon his memorial shaft is inscribed, \"He Was the Poor Man's Friend.\" He was buried at Pleasant Hill by the Masonic fraternity. Dr. R. L. Armstrong, Jr., was born June 9, 1857, near Pleasant Hill. He attended the Medical University of Louisiana in 1877-78 and graduated at the medical department of Louisville University in 1879. Soon after graduating he married Miss Hattie O'Pry and located at Pleasant Hill, where he has been a prominent physician for over thirty years. He has a son, Dr. Ralph Armstrong, who is now a physician, thus making in the family three generations of physicians.\n\nBOONE, SENATOR JOHN H.\n\nThe subject of this sketch was born at the old town of Sparta, in Bienville parish, November 7, 1871. His parents were Judge J. T. and C. L. Boone, members of old and estimable families. His father was a prominent figure in the politics of his parish and state for many years and occupied important public positions. The early years of John H. Boone's life were spent on a farm. In 1888 the family moved to Mt. Lebanon where he attended Mt. Lebanon College, and being an earnest and hard-working student he secured an education sufficient to enable him to enter his chosen profession. After concluding his college course he taught in the public schools and at Mt. Lebanon College for two years. In 1899 he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Bienville parish until 1901 when he came to Many, forming a partnership with Judge Don E. SoRelle. Upon Mr. SoRelle's election as district judge in 1908, the firm was dissolved, but the partnership was resumed during the present year. Mr. Boone is not only a hard-working lawyer, but has always taken an active and patriotic interest in the material welfare of the parish, and is a firm exponent of every move for the uplift of the people morally and intellectually. His popularity among the people is amply attested by the fact that they have elected him to every position for which he has offered. He served several years as mayor of Many, and on being elected a member of the Parish School Board he was unanimously chosen as the presiding officer of that body, and filled these positions with honor. In 1912 he was elected a member of the State Senate from the district composed of the parishes of DeSoto, Sabine and Vernon and has rendered his district and state splendid services. It is a safe prediction that among the young lawyers of West Louisiana no one has a more promising future, in any of the endeavors which a lawyer is privileged to make than Senator Boone. He was married, December, 1899, to Miss Minnie D. King, an accomplished young lady of Mt. Lebanon, and they have a most interesting family. Senator Boone is vice president of the People's State Bank of Many and owns a cozy home here.\n\nBROWN, W. S.\n\nFew men have spent a more extended and useful life as a citizen of the parish than W. Scott Brown. He was born in 1848 and spent his entire life in Sabine parish. His parents were pioneers of Ward Two, where some of the earliest settlers of this section of the state located. Mr. Brown has served his parish and ward in various official capacities for many years, as may be seen by reference to the annals of the parish government. He was an upright and conscientious citizen and commanded the respect of all who knew him. Mr. Brown was engaged in the mercantile business for many years and a few months ago opened a store at Hornbeck. While these memoirs were being printed Mr. Brown died at the home of his son, Mr. Edward Brown, in Ward Two.\n\nBYRD, J. W.\n\nThis gentleman is a member of the Parish School Board from Ward Two. He was born in Winn parish, September 21, 1867, and when a small child came to Sabine parish, near Negreet. He was reared and has always resided in the southern part of the part of the parish. He attended the old school at Fort Jesup during the first and third years of its existence, when Prof. T. R. Hardin presided as principal of that institution, after which he taught school for several years. Mr. Byrd was married to Miss Estelle Sanders, September 11, 1892, and to that union nine children have been born, five boys and four girls. He joined the Missionary Baptist church in 1892. He settled on a small farm after his marriage, and established Rattan postoffice in 1893, and was postmaster eight years. He was elected as a member of the School Board from his ward and was re-elected in 1912. He is a good citizen and stands for every move in the direction of parish progress.\n\nBARBEE, LESLIE\n\nNo history of this parish is in any manner complete without notice of Leslie Barbee, the most prominent pioneer of Fort Jesup, who came to this parish in 1842. He was born in Wake County, N. C., January 16, 1812, and died in 1900. He was a son of Mark and Tempey (Garner) Barbee, who were of English and Scotch descent. Irrespectively, when he came to this country he located at Fort Jesup and engaged in agricultural pursuits, although he was known as a \"Jack of all trades,\" and could turn his hand to any useful employment. He engaged in the mercantile business in 1860, in which he continued for many years. He always took a prominent part in parish affairs and in 1878-79 represented the parish in the State Legislature. Mr. Barbee was married in 1838 to Miss Argenene, a native of Georgia, and to them were born six children: Caroline, wife of M. P. Hawkins (deceased); Mary J., wife of W. W. McNeely (deceased); William H. (deceased), Joseph L., Nellie, wife of W. A. Ponder (deceased), and Nettie, wife of Amos L. Ponder, Joseph L. Barbee is now a resident of Fort Jesup and has a pretty home there. He has a family of six children, Joseph L., Jr., being the eldest. He has been engaged in farming and mercantile pursuits all his life. William H. Barbee was during his lifetime engaged in the mercantile business at Fort Jesup, besides taking a part in every move for the good of his parish and community, occupying at various times several public positions. His wife was Miss Emma Draughon. He died March 11, 1908, his wife's death occurring a few years prior to that time. Five children were born to them: Leslie, Effie, wife of I. L. Pace; Rena, wife Reese Pattison; Wm. J., and Nona.\n\nCLEVELAND, OSCAR O.\n\nOscar O. Cleveland, cashier of the recently established People's State Bank of Many, was born in Leak County, Mississippi, October 9, 1876. He went to public schools and after coming to Many with his father, W. B. Cleveland, in 1898, he entered the station of the K. C. S. Ry. to learn the railroad business remaining in the employ of that company until he engaged in business in partnership with J. H. McNeely in 1902. In 1905 he again entered the employ of the railroad as station agent at Many, and after three years service he resigned and accepted a position with the Santa Fe Railway. He filled some important positions with that company in Louisiana and Texas. He resigned to become cashier of the People's State Bank of Many, He is a conservative businessman and a genial gentlemen. Mr. Cleveland was married in 1904 to Miss Claudia, eldest daughter of Judge and Mrs. Don E. SoRelle.\n\nCORVUS, JULIAN\n\nJulian Corvus, M. D., was born at Negreet, Sabine parish, September 16, 1875, and is the third son of Dr. William R. Curtis, a pioneer physician of Sabine and a surgeon in the Civil War, and Emily Francis Moore. His childhood days were spent at Hemphill, Texas, and at Negreet, in this parish. At the age of 15 he entered the Fort Jesup Masonic Institute while the school was under the supervision of Prof. A. D. Carden, one of the South's ablest instructors. Early in life he married Miss Nona Jackson and resided at Negreet until his father's death in 1897. Being inspired to take up his father's profession where he laid it down, he entered the Alabama Medical College at Mobile, attending one term in the fall and spring of 1897-98, and then spent two years at the Memphis Hospital College, graduating in the spring of 1901 and passed the State Board of Louisiana in May of the same year. He located at Fort Jesup and practiced until October, 1904, when he accepted a position with the Rapides Lumber Co. at Woodworth, La., one of the Long-Bell plants, as physician and surgeon, resigning same in April, 1906, and moved to Many, where he continued the practice of his profession in partnership with Dr. D. H. Dillon until October of that year. The succeeding seven years have been delightfully spent in the service of the Brown Lumber Co. at Shamrock, La.\n\nCURTIS, JOHN J.\n\nJohn J. Curtis was born in Sabine parish on June 17, 1843, and is one of the oldest native citizens now living in the parish. His father was a pioneer of the Toro country, settling there in 1827. The subject of this sketch received what little education he was able to obtain in a log school house. In April, 1861, when only 18 years of age, he enlisted in the first company which left Sabine parish to fight in the Civil War, under the command of Capt. Arthur McArthur. This command was assigned to the army in Virginia in Gen. Stonewall Jackson's brigade. Mr. Curtis was in the most memorable battles of the campaigns of that famous commander. When the battle of the Wilderness was begun on the 5th of May, 1864, only fourteen men of Mr. Curtis' company responded for service, and his leg was broken in this bloody conflict, and his friend Bob Runnels was killed by his side. After lying wounded on the field for three days, he was picked up by the Yankees and taken to their hospital and he saw only two or three of his comrades after that time. He was taken prisoner by Stewart's cavalry. He recovered from his wound sufficiently to return home the following fall, and the war was ended a few months later, but, after more than half a century the scenes of that mighty conflict are still fresh in his memory. He was married and reared a family, all of whom have passed to their reward.\n\nCRANFORD, THOMAS JEFFERSON\n\nThomas Jefferson Cranford, the present sheriff of Sabine parish, was born near Pleasant Hill, Sabine parish, October 3, 1863, his parents being William H. and Cynthia (Anderson) Cranford. His father, whose death occurred while serving in the Civil War, May, 1864, was a native of Alabama, while his mother was born and reared in Sabine parish, her father being Wade Anderson, a pioneer, whose son, Jeff Anderson, was sheriff of this parish in 1863 and died while an occupant of that office, his father serving the unexpired term. When old enough to work Mr. Cranford followed the plow and helped to support his widowed mother. There were no schools in the country and he reached manhood with a very limited education. His mother, several years after the war, married C. D. Carroll, to which union two children were born, S. L. Carroll, who is now a prominent merchant of Zwolle, and Annie, who is the wife of John Paul and resides in Texas. Mr. Cranford followed the occupation of farming until 1902. He served two terms as Police Juror in the 1890's and was a member of that body from his old home ward (the Sixth) when the present courthouse and jail were constructed. In 1901 he moved to Many to accept a position as field deputy for Sheriff Henderson, purchasing a farm just outside the corporate limits. Mr. Henderson resigned his office in November, 1902, and Mr. Cranford was appointed sheriff by Governor Heard. He has occupied the position ever since, having been three times elected. As ex-officio tax collector, he has always collected the taxes and turned same into the parish treasury promptly on the first of July of each year, and has made it a rule to collect more than is charged. He is also proud of the fact that he has never found it necessary to seriously hurt a prisoner while in the discharge of his duties Mr. Cranford is a genial gentleman and courteous officer. In 1886 he was married to Miss Cora Hooker and to them have been born four children; Maggie, Rupert (died at the age of 7 years), Lola and Nellie.\n\nCOBURN, THOMAS G.\n\nThomas G. Coburn, of Coburn postoffice, was born in Coffey County, Alabama, April 23, 1844, and moved with his parents to Louisiana in February, 1852, arriving in Many that year. The family was going to Texas, but after staying here two years procured land in the southeast corner of the parish where the subject of this sketch now resides. Mr. Coburn might thus be considered a pioneer. He enlisted in the Confederate army in 1862, at the age of 18 years, under General Dick Taylor and served until the battle of Mansfield, April, 1864, when he was seriously wounded, and he has never fully recovered from the effects of the wound. After the war he returned to his home to start anew and to do battle against the outrages of reconstruction. On November 19, 1868, he was married to Miss S. J. Phares, and to that union ten children were born, seven of them still living. Mrs. Coburn died on March 6, 1899, and on January 1, 1890 [sic], he was married to Miss E. C. Bolton. Six children were born to them, five still living. On June 19, 1910, she, too, passed to her reward. Mr. Coburn served for a number of years as a member of the Parish School Board, and has been identified with all progressive movements in his community and parish.\n\nDILLON, E. C.\n\nThis gentleman enjoys the distinction of being the oldest citizen now living who was born in the town of Many, and whose life has been spent in this vicinity. It is not the portion of many men to live to witness the many changes and wonderful transitions that have been seen by the subject of this sketch. His maternal grandfather was John Baldwin, \"the father of Many,\" who felled the first trees for a home here and contributed much to the work of the early development of the country. Mr. Dillon was born at September 10, 1849. His father was Patrick Henry Dillon, a native of Virginia, and his mother was Jane Baldwin, daughter of John Baldwin. To their marriage were born two boys, John Dillon, a prominent citizen of Mansfield, and E. C., the subject of this sketch. His mother died in 1850, and his father's death occurred a few years later. He was reared by his uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Davidson. He is proud to recall that he received his instruction at old Bellwood College, near Many, under Prof. Preston, and later in a school conducted by that learned teacher in Texas. In 1871 he was married to Miss Louisa Sibley, daughter of Major William W. Sibley, and to that union six children were born: Daniel Harvey, W. Edward, Davidson (deceased), Elizabeth (wife of A. R. Petersen), Lattie (wife of Floyd C. Mitchell) and John P. Two of his sons, D. H. and W. E., are prominent members of the medical profession in this parish. After the death of Mrs. Dillon, he was married to Miss Rilla Self, daughter of Judge Elijah Self, a pioneer of Sabine and for many years an esteemed citizen and prominent in the political life of Vernon parish. Four children were born to them, three now living: Percy, Josephine and Bertha. Death again claimed his wife and companion and in 1892 he married Miss Annie Goss of Pleasant Hill and they have a pretty and pleasant home. Mr. Dillon is brisk and active for a man of his advanced age. He has always been a lover of his town and parish, has always stood for everything for their glory and material welfare, and has an abiding faith in the future of his country. In battling with the adversities of his long life he has ever been in the vanguard of the optimists, never losing sight of that star of hope which is the beacon of the just on earth and in the after-while. His geniality and open-heartedness have made him friends wherever he is known, and these traits of character are manifest every day. For many years Mr. Dillon was engaged in farming, but in later years in business pursuits, and conducted a drug business under the name of Dillon Drug Co. He served the past two years as mayor of Many, and was the prime mover in organization of the Parish Fair Association in 1909, and is the present president of that institution. Mr. Dillon is president of the People's State Bank of Many, and it was principally through his efforts that this bank was started. He remembers when there was not a cook stove or sewing machine to be found in the parish, observes that there has been great progress made since that time, but he hopes to see more.\n\nDILLON, W. E.\n\nW. E. Dillon, M. D., was born January 15, 1877, in Sabine parish, his parents being E. C. and Louisa (Sibley) Dillon. He attended parish schools and the Memphis Hospital Medical College, graduating from that institution on April 27, 1900. For the following six years he practiced at Fisher and Florien and for two years was located at Bon Ami. He returned to his old home at Many, where he is now engaged in the practice of his profession, about four years ago. In December, 1901, he was married to Miss Zeta Brown of Canton, Miss., and to them three children have been born, two of whom, a boy and a girl, are living. Dr. Dillon has a pleasant home in Many and is an enterprising citizen.\n\nDILLON, D. H.\n\nD. H. Dillon, M. D., was born in Sabine parish, May 12, 1873, being the eldest son of E. C. and Louisa (Sibley) Dillon. His early education was procured in the public schools and at Keachie College. He entered Memphis Medical College from which he graduated in 1898 and came to Sabine parish to practice his profession. For some time he was located at Fisher as chief surgeon for the Louisiana Long Leaf Lumber Company and local surgeon of the Kansas City Southern Railway. In 1904 he was elected representative of Sabine parish in the State Legislature for a term of four years. During that time he also practiced medicine at Many, one year in partnership with Dr. Julian Curtis. In 1908 Dr. Dillon was appointed president of the State Board of Health by Governor Sanders and occupied that position for two years and left a clean record. Resigning his place on the board, he returned to Many and practice of his profession. As a physician he has been very successful, being a hard and untiring worker. At this time he has as his professional associate Dr. W. D. Lester and has an office in the People's State Bank Building. Dr. Dillon was married in 1896 to Miss Nettie Self, daughter of Judge Elijah Self, and to them has been born one son. The doctor has always been progressive in his ideas, has always been a conspicuous figure in public affairs and is not ready to promise that he will keep out of the political game in the days to come.\n\nESTES, ADDISON W.\n\nAddison W. Estes - Sabine parish has never had a better citizen nor a more faithful public servant than Mr. Estes. He was born in this parish September 11, 1847. While still a young man he was crippled for life, but for many years thereafter he followed farming and the saddle maker's trade. He reared a family of four girls and two boys, three of whom are still living. His wife died in 1902 and he was later married to Miss McDonald, daughter of Robert McDonald, a pioneer of the parish, and to that union two children have been born. In July, 1884, Mr. Estes was elected parish treasurer and has held that position ever since. In 1892 he was elected clerk of the Police Jury and remained in that position until the present year, when he resigned and was succeeded by W. G. Caldwell. The esteem in which he is held by his fellow citizens is best exemplified by his continuance in his public position.\n\nFRASER, RICHARD A.\n\nRichard A. Fraser (Attorney-at-Law) was born in Mansfield, La., February 3, 1879, and was reared and secured his education in that town. In 1904 he graduated from the Law Department of Tulane University and returned to his home town and practiced his profession until 1909, when he formed a partnership with Silas D. Ponder at Many, which was dissolved in 1912. Besides having a good law practice, he is associated with Dan Vandegaer in the abstract business, the style of the firm being Vandegaer & Fraser, and is secretary and treasurer of the Sabine Realty Co. He was married in 1910 to Miss Lula Peters, an estimable young lady of Many, and they have a nice home.\n\nFULLER, JOHN B.\n\nJohn B. Fuller was born at Shiloh, Union parish, November 22, 1851, and spent his boyhood days there. On May 27, 1871, he was married to Evie Sherwood and in August of that year moved to Catahoula parish, near Harrisonburg, and in 1875 came to Sabine parish and has resided here ever since. In 1886 he was elected constable of his ward, but resigned in 1889 and was appointed postmaster at Mitchell and served in that position for two years. He served one term as member of the Parish School Board. In 1910 he was elected as a member of the Police Jury, and for one term was president of that body. In 1912 he was re-elected Police Juror. Mr. Fuller has always been a conservative exponent of every proposition for the public good and advancement, standing for the things that make for good citizenship, and has aimed to serve the people faithfully and impartially, and is esteemed as a man of sterling integrity and splendid character.\n\nGANDY, RUFUS SIBLEY\n\nRufus Sibley Gandy, member of the Police Jury from Ward One, was born on his father's estate near Many, November 29, 1861. His father was Daniel R. Gandy, one of the early settlers of the parish, whose prominence in parish affairs is recalled on other pages of this book. Mr. Gandy's parents died when he was quite young and he lived with his maternal grandfather, John I. Sibley, on Bayou Toro, this parish, until he was 14 years of age. He then lived with his uncle, L.

Gandy, a prominent farmer and president of the Police Jury, was born in Bibb County, Alabama, in 1847, and is a son of Harvey M. and Mary Caroline (Martin), whose deaths occurred in 1847 and 1854 respectively. His grandfather was John Gandy, a native of Georgia and his grandmother was the daughter of John Martin, a planter, of North Carolina. He was reared by an uncle, Wiley R. Gandy, but received only a limited education. When 14 years of age he joined Company B, Forty-fourth Alabama Infantry, which was assigned to the Army of Virginia, participating in the greatest battles of that famous army. He was wounded at the battle of Chickamauga and incapacitated for duty for several months, and during his service he was twice made a prisoner, but each time was paroled and returned to his command and was a sergeant when General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House. After the war he returned to Alabama, and in 1868 came to Sabine Parish, being married in 1872 to Mary J., a daughter of Elijah Self, she being born in this parish and dying eleven months after her marriage. Mr. Gandy's second union took place in 1874, his wife being Mary Caroline Sibley, a daughter of William and Minerva Sibley, who were born in St. Helena Parish. Six children were born to them.

For more than twenty years he has served as a member of the Police Jury and a large portion of the time as president of the body, and has rendered his parish most valuable services. He is held in the highest esteem by his fellow citizens for his conservative judgment and counsel, unimpeachable integrity and withal a most genial gentleman. Despite his advanced age, he takes a live interest in the affairs in his community and parish.\n\nGIAUQUE, FLORIEN\n\nWhile the subject of this memoir is not in the real sense a citizen of Sabine parish, he has been prominently identified with the material progress of the parish for more than a third of a century and is worthy of special mention. At one time he was one of the largest individual land owners in this parish and still owns considerable real estate here. The data for the following sketch was gleaned from biographies of Mr. Giauque which appear in histories of Wayne County, Ohio, \"Alibono's Dictionary of Authors\" and in \"Who's Who in America,\" and from his old friends and acquaintances in Sabine parish. Florien Giauque was born in Berlin, Ohio, May 11, 1848. His parents were Augustus and Sophia (Guillaume) Giauque, who were born of good families in the French speaking Canton of Berne, Switzerland, and immigrated to Holmes County, Ohio, where they were married. In 1849 they moved to Wayne County, Ohio, Mr. Giauque's father dying soon afterward, leaving to his widow only means enough to buy a modest cottage home in Fredericksburg, where she began the work of rearing her children, sending them to the public school and to the Presbyterian Sunday school. In 1855 she married Mr. Jeanneret, also a native of Switzerland, who followed the trade of a jeweler. The stepfather, while providing for the wants of the family, did not encourage young Florien's ambition to secure an education. One of Mr. Giauque's pleasantest as well as proudest recollections of his boyhood days was that, \"prizing first of all good character, he would make of himself a man as well educated and cultured and well-to-do financially as his people had ever been in Switzerland (they having suffered financial losses by immigrating to America), and to this end he determined to graduate at a good college, and, soon after, also determined to become a good lawyer.\" He never wavered from this determination, although his path was at times strewn with trials. In 1861 his mother died of typhoid fever and a few days later his eldest sister, who had married, also succumbed to the same disease. With $10 he had earned making ties, and with what he could earn while school was not in session, he attended a five months' session at Vermillion Institute, Haysville, Ohio, with a view of fitting himself for teaching. He worked for farmers that summer and secured a good school at Wooster, Ohio, for the following winter. But the Civil War was now going on and his state was calling for volunteers and he enlisted in Co. H, 102nd Ohio Infantry. He served under Generals Grant, Buell, Sherman, Rosecrans and Thomas. During his term of service in the army he never asked for nor received a furlough, and while he was in broken health when discharged at the end of the struggle, he has never applied for a pension and says he never intends to. He first came to Louisiana when the days of reconstruction were yet dark, but never tried to conceal the fact that he had been a soldier in the Union army neither did he ever make his political views the subject of a conversation calculated to offend anyone; his deportment always has been that of a polished gentleman, ever ready to extend kind words, good counsel and assistance and many citizens of Sabine parish are grateful for having formed his acquaintance. After the war Mr. Giauque resumed the work of completing his education by becoming a teacher-student at Vermillion Institute. In 1866 he entered Kenyon College at Gambier, Ohio, where he graduated with the highest honors in 1869, having won his way into the Phi Beta Kappa society by his high standing, the only way any person may become a member except by distinguished scientific or literary work. He wears the watch charm which was presented to him by that society and esteems it as one of his most valuable possessions. Though poor in the material things of the world, he won the respect and esteem of his wealthy classmates from the Eastern states, and in his senior year they elected him the class orator, the highest honor they could bestow. After teaching school for a while, he opened a law office in Cincinnati and has been practicing that profession ever since, and most of the time has had as a partner Henry B. McClure, Esq., who is reputed as an excellent gentleman, a finished scholar and an able lawyer. Mr. Giauque, besides being a hard working lawyer, has been the editor of several legal works and has contributed articles to the leading periodicals of the country on request, principally on scientific subjects, and has occasionally delivered lectures. He has taken a keen interest in American archaeology, and once had a splendid collection of stone and copper prehistoric implements, pottery, etc., which were exhibited and won medals at various expositions, including the World's Fair at Philadelphia in 1776. After beginning the practice of law Mr. Giauque gave some attention to buying and selling real estate, which business has been so fascinating for him that he has continued in this line and his ventures have been uniformly successful. He has promoted additions to Cameron, Mo., and Deshler, Ohio. When the Kansas City Southern Railroad built through Sabine parish he sold 82,700 acres of land to promoters connected with that road, and they honored him by naming the town of Florien in this parish for him. He still owns several thousand acres of land in several parishes in Louisiana, but he has disposed of a large part of his lands in Sabine. For many years he spent the month of December in Many, but in recent years his visits here have been brief and less regular. He still predicts a great future for the parish and that the South will yet become the richest and grandest country in the world. Mr. Giauque was married November 18, 1884, to Mary, daughter of William H. Miller, a lawyer of Hamilton, Ohio, who was killed in action while serving as an officer in the Union army. She was the grand-daughter on her mother's side of John Woods, during his life time a leading lawyer of Hamilton, a member of congress, auditor of the state of Ohio, and the promoter of several important public enterprises. Five of her ancestors did honorable service in the Revolutionary War, on the American side, and others in the earlier colonial wars. Mrs. Giauque died during the winter of 1912. No children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Giauque.\n\nGOON, W. P.\n\nW. P.

Having accumulated considerable money by the judicious handling of capital derived from land inherited, and thinking to find a better field for the pursuit of his profession, he removed to Texas in March, 1886, to meet with disappointment in finding the profession overcrowded, and, having invested his money in a speculative venture, he was compelled to await developments, which resulted in the loss of all by reason of the financial stringency of 1890. Presaging the tide of prosperity from Texas to Louisiana, in April, 1896, he preceded the railroad to Many, where he has since devoted himself to the honorable pursuit of his profession.\n\nHOMES, DAVID J.\n\nDavid J.
