I am currently working as an assistant professor in Educational Neuroscience at Leiden University.\n\nDuring my PhD research I studied the development of the brain, learning and school performance. Moreover, I focused on the influence of brain connectivity on risk-taking and alcohol use in adolescence.\n\n​\n\nI am coordinator for the EARLI Neuroscience and Education Group."
