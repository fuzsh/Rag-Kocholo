[ Bird screeches ] ...and Swainson's hawks.\n\nSome local, others just passing through.\n\nAll waiting for the right moment.\n\n♪♪ At sundown the bats prepare to leave for the night.\n\n♪♪ Diving through the crowd risks injury, and inexperienced raptors move early.\n\n♪♪ Moments later, the bats begin to stream out.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ In open sky, they're an easier target.\n\n♪♪ They fly at over 60 miles an hour.\n\n♪♪ Getting up to speed, the hunters aim for any stragglers.\n\n♪♪ Swallowing them on the wing.\n\n♪♪ The bats keep coming, and a feast begins.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ It takes hours for them all to leave the cave.\n\n♪♪ The less experienced birds have time to hone their skills.\n\n♪♪ While the real top guns show off... ♪♪ ...taking one bat in each foot.\n\n♪♪ The feast lasts four months through summer... ♪♪ ...before the bats return south.\n\nSome hunters stay the whole season.\n\nOthers move on, seeking new opportunities.\n\nOpportunities that can see them form extraordinary relationships.\n\n[ Wind howling ] [ Bird squawking ] Standing 3 feet tall, weighing 20 pounds, Steller's sea eagles are one of the world's biggest raptors.\n\nIn winter, they visit the remote coast of far northern Japan... ...where they're joined by white-tailed eagles, with an 8-foot wingspan.\n\nThey're all here for one thing.\n\nIn this small community, pollock fishing is big business.\n\n♪♪ For decades, the bycatch from all these boats has offered easy pickings through the toughest months of the year.\n\n♪♪ Known locally as the great eagles, they're a welcome sight.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ And on bleak winter days, they put on a spectacular show.\n\n♪♪ Coming all the way into the harbor.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Attracting another type of visitor.\n\nTourists.\n\n♪♪ [ Camera shutter clicking ] ♪♪ People flock from all over the world, drawn by an awe of giant raptors.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Needing boats to reach the sea ice, the tourist trade now rivals the fishing industry.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ For people, it's a once-in-a-lifetime shot to see a bird that spends most of its life in remote far eastern Russia.\n\n♪♪ The eagles are simply here for an easy meal.\n\n♪♪ But in an increasingly human world, what does the future hold for our planet's raptors?\n\nHabitat loss, persecution, and a changing climate means 1/3 of birds of prey are under threat.\n\nBut given the space, raptors can overcome extreme challenges.\n\n♪♪ And there are stories of hope.\n\n♪♪ The wetlands of Central Florida.\n\n♪♪ A patchwork of waterways.\n\n♪♪ Home to a rare and very special bird of prey.\n\n♪♪ The Florida snail kite.\n\n♪♪ So called for its unusual diet.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ One made up mostly of aquatic snails.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Snails are able to seal themselves inside their shells.\n\nIt takes a long, hooked beak to pry them open.\n\nA unique beak with quite the tale to tell.\n\n♪♪ In the early 2000s, an invasive snail species took over these wetlands.\n\n♪♪ The new snails were five times bigger than their usual prey.\n\nMost snail kites couldn't eat them.\n\n♪♪ Many birds vanished, along with any hope for their survival in Florida.\n\n♪♪ But 10 years later, the snail kites were back.\n\n♪♪ Their population tripling to over 2,000 birds.\n\n♪♪ And they were catching and eating the bigger snails.\n\n♪♪ But with some major changes.\n\n♪♪ Their beaks and bodies had grown up to 12% bigger in little more than a decade.\n\n♪♪ It turns out a few big-beaked birds could handle the new supersized prey.\n\n♪♪ And birds with bigger beaks pass those genes on to their young.\n\n[ Birds squawking ] ♪♪ Happening in less than two snail kite generations, the speed of change is almost unbelievable.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Florida's snail kites are evolving right in front of us.\n\n♪♪ Given the chance, even top predators can adapt to extreme changes.\n\nThis tiny chick will one day be a fearsome predator.\n\nThe talons on which she'll depend are already her most distinctive feature.\n\nBut what really stands out is where she lives.\n\n♪♪ The city of Durban, South Africa.\n\n♪♪ Surprising, because she's an African crowned eagle, the most powerful bird of prey on the planet.\n\n♪♪ While in the nest, Mom shows her tender side.\n\nShe is armed with talons that can crush bone.\n\n♪♪ She takes prey weighing up to 60 pounds.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ Imagine a raptor whose ancestors hunted our own nesting in your backyard.\n\n♪♪ Most people embrace the change.\n\nAnd while declining elsewhere, Durban's crowned eagles are thriving.\n\n[ Insects buzzing ] This nest on a sewer pipeline is the first ever known on an artificial structure.\n\n♪♪ And there's now a higher density of them here than anywhere in Africa.\n\n♪♪ In the wild, most nests are at least 3 miles apart.\n\nIn Durban, the nearest neighbors are just half a mile away.\n\n♪♪ This is why.\n\n♪♪ The city is full of prey.\n\n♪♪ Vervet monkeys fall quiet in the neighborhoods where eagles nest.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ [ Monkeys chittering ] ♪♪ Everyone's accounted for, the alarm raised in time.\n\n♪♪ But this rock hyrax wasn't so lucky.\n\n♪♪ A meal like this will keep the 6-week-old chick busy for days.\n\nBut she grows quickly... ♪♪ ...looking more eagle-like every day.\n\n♪♪ By 12 weeks, food drops are bigger.\n\n♪♪ And she can handle them by herself.\n\n♪♪ From now on, Mom and Dad's visits will be less frequent.\n\n[ Eagle screeching ] ♪♪ It's confusing when parents don't answer your calls.\n\n♪♪ But tough love encourages her to spread her wings.\n\n♪♪ She'll still depend on them for much of the next year.\n\n♪♪ Hunting large, smart prey will take a lot of practice.\n\n♪♪ It's a tough time ahead.\n\nShe'll need to carve out her place, not just among her own kind but alongside the people here, too.\n\n♪♪ A hunter's life is full of challenges.\n\n♪♪ Intense competition.\n\n♪♪ Other predators.\n\n♪♪ And the uncertainties of our changing world.\n\n♪♪ But armed with a fistful of daggers, raptors have risen to the top.\n\n♪♪ Theirs are powers we can only dream of.\n\n♪♪ A mastery of flight.\n\n♪♪ Specialized adaptations.\n\n♪♪ And mind-blowing senses.\n\n♪♪ They've conquered nearly every habitat with inventive solutions and surprising
