        "text": "Sabine Parish, Louisiana\n\nHistory and Genealogy LA AHGP\n\nReturn to Louisiana Main Page\n\nReturn to Sabine Parish Main Page\n\nSabine Parish is bounded on the north by the parishes of De Soto and Natchitoches, on the east by Natchitoches, on the south by Vernon and on the west by the Sabine River. The country is one of rolling oak uplands with a long leaf pine district in the southeastern corner. The total area is 1,008 square miles, of which the central prairie occupies 200. The long leaf pine 150 and the oak upland 658 square miles. There were 18,524 acres cultivated in 1879-80, of which 5,952 acres were under cotton; 7,971 acres under corn; 191 in sweet potatoes and 85 acres in sugar cane. There were 2,313 bales of cotton produced, or .39 bale per acre, of 555 pounds of seed cotton or 185 pounds of cotton lint. In 1889-90 the producing area and the products were nearly doubled. The population in 1890 (State census) is 10,529, comprising 4,216 White males and 3,983 females, 1,101 Colored males and 1,229 females. There are 684 men subject to military service. The population in 1880 was 7,344, of which number 5,486 were White and 1,858 Colored. In 1870 there were 4.592 White and 1,847 Colored, and in 1860, 4,115 White and 1,713 Colored. In 1850 there were 3,347 Whites and 1,168 slaves.\n\nThere are several kinds of land in Sabine, but, these in cultivation are what are generally termed uplands. Even the extreme uplands, a light gray sandy soil, produce well, and the hammock and creek bottom lands are very fertile, yielding, with proper cultivation, all that can be well gathered. The parish is literally threaded with streams of pure water, some of considerable size and others smaller.\n\nThe bayous San Patricio and St. Miguel run from the north center of the parish through Wards 5, 6, 7 and 8 to the Sabine River. Bayou Cie or Scie is a short stream flowing into St. Miguel. Bayou La Nana runs from Ward 4, through Ward 3, into the Sabine River, as also does Bayou Toro. Bayou Negreet runs into the Sabine. The White Sulphur Springs, in the northwestern corner of Sabine, one and one-half miles from the Sabine River and thirty miles from Mansfield, have been visited by invalids from the earliest times. Two miles east of Many are other medicinal springs, while the sulphur springs near Bayou San Patricio and the tar spring win some favorable notice. The saline springs and salt works in the southwestern townships were developed during the war.\n\nA fair lime rock is found in the Fort Jesup neighborhood, and in very early days a lime kiln was constructed there. In 1823, when the United States troops cleared the land for the fort, this kiln was discovered, and therein was burned the lime used in building the foundations of the houses. Not, far from the salines, iron ore is found, while lignite exists in several localities. Deer are still here and the skilled hunter is generally rewarded for his labor. The bear and panther are visitors, but the catamount is a resident. In January, 1890. Louis Buvens killed a large catamount near Many, and hunting this animal has become a favorite pastime. The rattlesnake and moccasin are the only dangerous reptiles here, but snake bites are seldom heard of. In August, 1890, two children of Mrs. P. Williams, residing near Many, were found playing with a large rattlesnake. In July, 1888, there was not a mortgage on record in this parish, but during the last few years a few mortgages, given as security for lands, are on record.\n\nThe settlement of this division of the State dates back to the second decade of the eighteenth century, when the great trails from the rapids of Red River and from the post at Natchitoches were opened into Mexico.\n\nNolan's Trace, between Alexandria and San Antonio, parallels the Natchitoches and San Antonio trace, four miles south. The great camp ground at Fallen Springs, four miles south of Many, is still remembered as the place where many murders and robberies were committed, and today searchers come hither to explore for lost treasures. There is now in possession of Leo Vandegaer a part of a silver cross, found by W. G. Lewing, four miles southeast of Many in 1888, and a part of a counterfeiter's outfit found near Carter's Ferry some years ago. Where the cross was found ruins of burned buildings are noticeable. On every side souvenirs of Spanish occupation fire brought to light, and as years pass by history and fable people the Sabine country with the extremes of good and bad in the Spanish character.\n\nOn November 14, 1795, Jacinto Mora was granted 207,300 acres on the east side of the Sabine River, twenty-five leagues distant from the village of the Lady of the Pillar, of Nacogdoches, Tex., known as Los Ormegas. In July, 1805, this tract was sold by Mora to Ed Murphy, William Barr, Samuel Davenport and L. Smith, and in December the tract was legally conveyed and the name Santa Maria Adelaida de Ormegas given to it. The Le Nana grant to Ed Murphy (twelve miles square) was made in 1797, and both grants were recognized by the United States in 1847. The neutral strip between Spanish and French America was settled at a very early day. Many stories are related of the inhabitants of this ancient No Man's Land, filling it with desperadoes of all races and later by regulators and moderators. Samuel Davenport, in his evidence before the Land Commission in 1824, stated that the neutral territory comprised all the country east of the Sabine and west of the Calcasieu River, Bayou Kisatchie to the mouth of Bayou Don Manuel, southeast of the latter bayou, Lac Terre Noir and Arroyo Honda and south of the Red River to the northwest line of Louisiana. He was a resident of-Nacogdoches, Tex., from 1798 to 1813. Jose M. Mora and Gregoria Mora the tax collector were born there, and John Carter, another witness, resided at Natchitoches. In November, 1824, the Rio Honda claimants presented evidences of settlement. In 1797 a square league was granted to Jose M. Mora, sixteen leagues from Natchitoches, at a place known as The Head of the Name of God.\n\nThe residents on the Rio Hondo in 1805 were John Yocum, M. Yocum, James Wilson, Philip Winfree and A. Winfree in Township 4, Range 12; James Walker, Nicholas Jacks and Hugh McNeely in Township 5, Range 11; Jacob Leahy, Thomas Arthur, Thomas Gray, C. Antheny and Benjamin Winfree in Township 5, Range 12; Green Cook in Township 5, Range 13; Edmund Quirk, William Quirk, Thomas Gray and Joseph Montgomery in Township 6, Range 12; Samuel Holmes and Benjamin Morris in Township 6, Range 10; John H. Thompson and Benjamin Billis, Township 7, Range 10; Jose Antonio Manchaca, Township 7, Range 12: Jacques Lepine, David Case and widow La Lena Faded, Township 7, Range 13; Manuel Gonzales, Jean Baptiste Perot, Andrew Bassum, Thomas Wilson, Jose Maria Procella (heirs of James Denney and Manuel Bustamento), Township 8, Range 10; Louis Latham, F. Gonzales and Jose Reus, Township 8, Range 11; Antonia De la Sarda, Jose Estrader, Peter Patterson, John Cortez, Widow Ganissieu Parrierd, Township 8, Range 12; Robert McDonald, Louis Latham, Henry Quirk, Henry Stoker, Dennis Dios, William P. Davidson, Manuel Chorion, James Kirkham, Hugh McGuffin and Maria Sanchez, Township 8, Range 10; Michael Early, John Litton and Asa Backum, Township 9, Range 12; Francisco Rosalis, Jose Bascus, Jose Autonia Rodriquez, John Maximillian and the Widow Interest Toval, Township 8, Range 12, and Gilliam Bebee, Township 8, Range 13. In 1819-24 the above named proved their claims, and after the survey of 1832 located their claims anew. The only relics of the first homes on the Rio Honda were explored four years ago by Surveyor Vandegaer. In 1841 the sales of the Yates & McIntyre lands in Sabine reached importance. Thomas Ford, J. Tynes, Williamson Maines, John Scritchfield, Mary Langford, B. Dally, James Lesley, W. H. Edmundson, Hosea Presley, William M. Polk, William and B. K. Ford, Henry Hall, N. H. Bray, Samuel Eldridge, S. S. Eason, W. G. Painter, J. G. Sibley, Elizabeth McDonald, C. Cherrington, Peter Buvens, J. Anderson, John Graham, A. Arthur and D. G. Etherege were among the first buyers of the lands of these speculators.

On this valuation a Confederate States war tax, amounting to $7,334.49, was collected, Thomas Franklin being supervising assessor. The owners of six or more slaves in that year are named as follows; E. L. Armstrong, 17; S. L. and Allen Arthur, 13; Wade Anderson, 8; T. A. and Mary Armstrong, 14; J. H. O.

Chapman was found to possess sixty-nine slaves, valued at $32,200. Aaron S. Neal had twenty-one slaves taxed, while the greater number of owners named above held their slaves and paid the war tax as levied that year.\n\nSabine Parish was established March 27, 1843, when Gov. Mouton signed the act defining its boundaries and providing for its government. The first record of the police jury is dated June 19, 1843, when the minutes of an adjourned meeting are recorded. T. Arthur, B. P. Biles, W. Estes, J. Lebo, E. B. Stille, J. E. Smart and A. Lavell were present as jurors: John Baldwin, treasurer, and S. S. Eason, secretary; John Lebo presided. A road from Hugo Wallace's house to the parish site was authorized. On June 20 a resolution postponing the sale of town lots at the original seat of justice was carried, the cause being the dissatisfaction expressed at the location.\n\nThe question of location was then taken up, and the Legislature petitioned to pass an act empowering the people to select a seat of justice in July. 1844. The Herald and the Reporter of Natchitoches were selected as advertising mediums. E. F. Presley was appointed assessor, John Q. McDonald, constable, and in September the following named administrators of public schools were appointed: Thomas Ford, D. E. Gandy, N. J. Alford, Hosea Presley and Voluntine Nash. In May, 1844, J. A. McLanahan replaced Arthur as juror; Hosea Presley was elected treasurer, Nathaniel Fashier, constable and George W. Thompson, surveyor. The line between Sabine and Rapids was ordered to be surveyed. In July, 1844. the jury considered that the electors had approved the original location of the seat of justice, and named Many in honor of Col. Many, then commanding at Fort Jesup. In November, John Ayres, B. P. Biles, A. Brown and James Kinner, qualified as jurors with the bitter president; the deed to the parish site was approved, and a building committee appointed. In 1845 E. K. McDonald, M. Fulcrod, J. B. Elam, T. G. S. Godwin and A. H. Redding qualified as jurors; A. Brown was president.\n\nIn 1846 J. B.

Horton and E. M. Cassel, qualified as jurors. In March, 1861, the question of disbursing the share of the $30,000 appropriated by the State toward the relief of the sufferers from floods and droughts was considered, and President Speight was authorized to draw upon the State treasurer for $1,500.\n\nOn May 6 the police jury held the next meeting, but beyond the provision made for the distribution of corn, from depots at Cobble Landing and Grand Ecores, little else was done. In June the election of Allan Holland, G. G. Garner and Silas Roberts is recorded. M. K. Speight, was chosen president and A. R. Mitchell clerk. The office of examiner of teachers for public schools was abolished, but restored next day, and A. R. Mitchell chosen examiner. E. C. Davidson was re-elected treasurer, and in August W. H.

Of this, $250 was appropriated for Capt. J. T. Jordan's company, then being organized. Acknowledgments were tendered Gov. Moore for his kindness in assuming for Sabine Parish the cost of uniforms and equipment, for the Sabine Rifles, and to N. H. Bray for equipping the Sabine Rebels. Twelve hundred dollars was appropriated to Capt. Smart's company in October, 1861. At this time $500 was granted to Capt. McAuretor's company, then at the front.\n\nIn January, 1862, the employment of a drillmaster was authorized. In April, 1862, the sum of $7,500, in parish warrants, was authorized. This was to be issued in scrip of $1, $2.50, $5, $10, $20 and $25. A further grant of $7 per month to the wives and mothers of soldiers was made, while to each child of men in service a grant of $2 per month was given. J. A.

W. Addison and J. M. Gibbs, Sr. were jurors. On June 4, the ultimatum of the board of school directors, asking that a tax for common school purposes not exceeding 2 mills, be levied. E. F. Presley, then secretary of the school board, drafted this requisition. F. D. Self, then State tax collector, was enjoined from collecting until a satisfactory bond would be entered into.\n\nOn June 7. 1877, E. F. Presley was elected treasurer, and, in October, attorney, and on July 2 the parish was redistricted into eight wards, under authority of the act of April 10, 1887. This act of July 2 did not come into force immediately, for, up to January 1, 1879, the same jurors managed parish affairs. On January 6, W. W. Arthur, Ward 1, president; T. J. Stringer, Ward 2; D. W. Carroll, Ward 3; Daniel Vandegaer, Ward 4; W. H. Farmer and H. H. Gallons, Ward 7; C. B. Darnell, Ward 5; and W. L. Shull, Ward 8, formed the post-reconstruction jury. E. W. Sibley, clerk, and E.

In January, 1880, the proposition of Editor.\n\nPresley, of the Southern, to do the public printing at a discount of fifty per cent on the legal rate of advertising, was met by the radical one of J. H. Caldwell & Co., of the Sabine Index, to do the same work gratis and pay the parish 30 cents for the privilege. The jurors agreed to accept the wild proposition of the Index people. In May, 1880, W. W. Arthur was chosen president, and J. H. Mitchell, clerk (succeeded in January, 1881, by E. W. Sibley). On May 5, 1880, J. T.

Webb as juror, and the death of H. Ferguson are recorded. In April, 1886, W. T. Alford was elected president, vice Forbis, resigned. Alford was succeeded in January, 1888, by Jehu Graham; but in June of that year the newly elected jury organized, with R. A. Forbis, president, A. W. Estes, clerk and treasurer, and the following named members: H. S. Elzey, T. J. Stringer, H. M. Gandy, W. M. Webb, H. H. Cassel, J. M. Fuller and William Tyler. At this term a tax of 7 mills for parish, and 2 mills for school purposes was authorized. The levy for 1890 is 6 mills for State, and 6 mills for parish purposes.\n\nThe first record of the district court is dated December 25, 1843. George R.

On December 27 ten indictments were returned, three for larceny, six for assault and battery, and one for selling liquor to a slave. On December 28 Francisco Negrovemis, a native of Catalonia, Spain, renounced allegiance to that country's monarch, and Nathan H. Bray gave notice of his intention to treat the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland in the same manner. In May, 1844, James Campbell of the Tenth District opened court. Daniel R. Gandy was sheriff, and Elias F. Presley, deputy sheriff. At this time the prisoners had to be taken hither from Natchitoches for trial, as Sabine had no jail. In December, 1845, C. Chaplin qualified as district attorney, to succeed W. L. Tuomey. James Taylor presented the commission of Gov. Johnson, in November, 1846, as judge of the Sixteenth District, and in May, 1847, Judge E. E. Ollcutt, of the Seventeenth District presided, vice Judge Taylor of this district. In August. 1850, Charles A. Bullard of the Sixteenth District was present. He presided here until September, 1853, when Chichester Chaplin took his place, with William T. Hamilton, district attorney. In November, 1854, Judge Land, of the Eighteenth District interchanged with the district judge, and appointed A. R. Mitchell, district attorney. S. H, Waples was admitted to practice law here in April, 1856, and some years later B. F. Presley began practice.\n\nFrom November, 1861, to April, 1863, there was no attempt made to hold court. Judge Chaplin presided. He was again present in November, 1864. In April, 1866, Judge William B. Lewis, of the Ninth District, opened court and continued to preside here until 1869, when Judge John Osborne was commissioned judge of the Ninth District and presided until November, 1873. For the two succeeding years there is no record of court, nor was there a regular term of court held. In November, 1875, Judge Chaplin was present and transacted the business of the court here until July 5, 1877, when David Pierson, of the Seventeenth District appointed John Davis, E. A. Forbis, William M. Antony and Daniel W. Carroll jury commissioners, and ordered the sheriff to call a special jury for the term of September. W. P. Hall was district attorney. The district is now known as the Eleventh; Judge Pierson still presiding with D. C. Scarborough district attorney. The docket has always been very light on the criminal side.\n\nOn May 10, 1878, Porter Brown was hanged here for aiding Ben Goodloe to murder Dr. H. W. Evans. Joseph Elijah Brown was hanged April 12, 1889, for a more serious crime. Other criminals have been summarily punished by the people, and not a few have been sent to prison under life sentences. The old bar comprised W. L. Tuomey, Joseph B. Elam, Chichester Chaplin, Chester Chaplin, Jr., W. T. Hamilton, S. H. Waples, E. C. Davison, A. R. Mitchell (now residing in Vernon Parish), J. F. Smith (died in 1890), E. P. Presley (now residing at Many), R. A. Hunter (now of Alexandria), George Head, T. C. Armstrong (now of Sodus), W. D. Carter (now of Sherman, Tex.), Amos L. Ponder (came in 1886), and W. G. McDonald (who settled in Many in 1890).\n\nThe journal of the parish court dates back to July 3, 1843, when William R. D. Speight, parish judge, presided. On July 7 the suit of G. Landrum vs. J. E. Roca was presented and C. A. Bui lard was appointed curator ad hoc to represent the absent defendant. S. S. Eason was clerk. In March, 1846, the district judge acted as judge in probate affairs. In July, 1849, E. F. Presley signs as clerk, and E. A. Gay as recorder. Some time after the abolition of the first parish court, G. Landrum, above named, killed Judge Speight opposite the hotel. In October, 1868, M, D. Edmondson opened the parish court with W. W. McNeely clerk. In March, 1871, W. W. McNeely presided as judge, and held this office until February, 1877, when J. C. Armstrong qualified. He was judge up to 1880. when the office was abolished under the new constitution.\n\nThe principal officers of the parish since 1843 are named as follows: District clerks: S. S.

John Jones, James Craig. Hugh Dowden, L. C. T. Sanders, James Sanders, W. H. Hollaway, Jordan Munson and W. S. Summers. Of the number the two last named are dead.\n\nCapt. McArthur's company was the first company raised in Sabine Parish for the Civil War. This was followed by Capt. J. T. Jordan's company (North Louisiana Cadets), Capt. N. H. Bray's company, Capt. Smart's company, Capt. Isaac Wright's Sabine Independents, a militia company, Capt. D, W. Self's volunteers and Capt. S. L. Holland's Sabine Guards. All the men of Sabine capable of military duty were in the field. In 1865-66 Capt. Carey was commandant at many. He was comparatively mild in his treatment of the Whites, and few, if any, complaints of his administration are made. The early anti-secessionists, such as E. P. Presley and the Stille's, won for their secession neighbors a measure of security, which would otherwise have been absent. The Sabine Southern was issued May 2, 1878, by W. P. Hutchison. His salutatory pointed out his true Democratic principles. On September 7, 1878, E. F, Presley and Henry Potts issued their salutatory as editors and proprietors, but from 1879 to September 4, 1890, Mr. Presley was owner and editor. On the date mentioned he sold the office to his sons, E. P. Presley, Jr., and H. M. Presley.\n\nThe Sabine Index was established in 1879 by Levi Stewart, J. H. Caldwell, John Blake and others. They were all contributors and opponents of the Southern. This opposition was carried to the extremes referred to in the page devoted to the transactions of the police jury, but like all extremists they exhausted themselves in little over a year. In September, 1890, the establishment of an anti-lottery journal was seriously entertained. The White pupils enrolled in Sabine in 1878 numbered 870; in 1879, 897; in 1883, 542; in 1884, 820; in 1885, 2,196; in 1886, 1,993 and in 1887, 2,313. The Colored enumeration for the same years is shown as follows: 150, 184, 315, 160, 333, 604 and 345. In the report, made by Supt. Amos L. Ponder (January. 1890), the parish is credited with 3,330 school children, Ward 4, containing 772 of the total number. In 1850 William D. Stephens was superintendent of free schools, and in 1851 E. A. Campbell held this position.\n\nThe physicians of the parish since 1840 are named as follows: Henry McCullen (the first physician at Many), James C. Armstrong, Dr. Goodloe (who resided on the west side of the Sabine), Dr. West (died in Texas), Dr. Cater (died in 1869), Dr. March (died in 1878), Dr. Nelson, Dr. Coleman, Dr. Thigpin, Dr. Elliot Smith, and during the war. Dr. Word, Dr. Collins (killed at Robeline, in 1888), Dr. Addison, Dr. Mills, Dr. Smart, George Dallas Armstrong, John Roily Franklin, Thomas Alexander Armstrong, Samuel Houston Cade, Thomas Welsh Abington (1861), Rezin Lawrence Armstrong, Jr., James Everett Mumford, Joseph Walker Speight, J.

Watkins, Joseph Edward Wall, John Foster, Joseph David Heard, John James Hatcher, Armistead Greenwood Dunn, Reddich Walter Sibley, Wiley Strickland Leggett.\n\nThe Farmers Co-operative Association, of the Farmers Union organizations, known as Central, Spring Ridge, Union, Wallace, San Patricio, Bayou Scie, Sardis, Oak Grove, Progress, Magnolia, Red Land, Buffalo, Rocky Springs, Red Bayou, Holly Springs and Emmanuel, organized November 22, 1888, with the object of establishing a place of business or supply store at Pleasant Hill. The Sabine Farmer's Supply Company was incorporated November 19, 1888, at Fort Jesup, with E. A. Forbis, John Mcllvain, Van Peters, P. B. Peters, T. J. Smith, J. E. Franklin, George T. Daily and W. E. Alford, directors. The Farmers' Commercial Co-operative Association was chartered March 11, 1889, with the following named directors: John S. Carroll (president), F. J. Davis (secretary), A. C. Lamberth (treasurer), W. S. Brown, J. M. Seever, J. W. Gandy, D. P. Gandy, G. W. Miller and J. H. Parrott. The capital stock was placed at $15,000, and the place of business in Ward 3. The store was located at Robeline.\n\nThe lumber manufacturing industries are few and insignificant compared with the great field and advantages which the parish offers. The saw mills are Leach's on Mill Creek; Nash's mill and James Leach's mill, in Ward 1; Peters in Ward 4; C. B. Darnell's in Ward 5; Robert's in Ward 3; Palmer's in Ward 2; Pugh & Son's in Ward 6; Taylor & Galloway's in Ward 7; Shuel's in Ward 8. The settlement of the town of Many and Fort Jesup dates back to the thirties. It was a wilderness when Fort Jesup was an important, military post, and was unknown when the Spaniards settled westward on the Sabine and eastward on Bayou Adayes. Twenty years after Port Jesup was established politics suggested the establishment of Sabine, De Soto and Bossier, and brought a new town into existence in each of the three divisions. Many was one of these creations, and to it was given the name of a popular officer at old Fort Jesup.\n\nOn May 17. 1843, W. R. D. Speight, I. W. Eason, G. W. Thompson and S. S. Eason donated to the parish of Sabine forty acres adjoining the line of Peter Buven's lands, beginning at the forks of the road east of Hosea Presley's house and along the Speight road. The plat, as surveyed December 21, 1844, by George W. Thompson, shows the public square and eight streets. The, first commissioners of the town were John Baldwin, Alex Biles, M. Fulcrond, Henry Earls and John Waterhouse. On December 31, 1844, they sold Lots 1 and 2 in Block 7, to Robert Parrott and William Edmondson for $39.50. Lots were also sold to J. B. Stoddard, P. H. Dillon, William Taylor, S. S. Eason, John Baldwin and later to L. Levinson, L. M. Rogers, B. K. Ford, C. Chaplin, T. McCarthy, H. McCallen, H. Hall, T. George, S. J. McCurdy, Tabitha Baldridge, J. B. Elam, G. E. Ward and B. Carpenter. In 1849 Baldwin, Stille and Ward, commissioners of Many, deeded to John Caldwell, John D. Tucker and Robert A. Gay for use of the Masonic society, known as Hamill Lodge, and to Abram Roberts, William D. Stephens, Robert D. Wright, William Maines and Henry McCallen, trustees of the Methodist Church South society Lots 19 and 20, in Block 7. The consideration was $20, and they erected a two-story building, the lower floor to be used for religious, and the upper for Masonic, purposes.\n\nIn October, 1852, D. E. Gandy donated to Antony McGee, Noah Martin and other trustees of the Baptist Church eight lots in Block 11. The first house built on the site of Many was the log house of John Baldwin, located where J. D. Stille's residence now stands. Additions were made to this house from time to time by E. B. and William Stille, who purchased the lot and house from Baldwin, and resided there up to 1879, when J. D. Stille purchased it. The old buildings (log and frame) were torn down in the fall of 1890, to give place to the present house. This building was the hotel in Baldwin's time, and was used as such up to its removal. The first store building, erected by John Baldwin, is still standing fronting the public square, and used as a cotton house by J. D. Stille. The second log house was constructed by Dr. McCallen. I t was his drug store and office and also Stille's general store, although the whole concern was only 1,728 cubical feet over a clay floor.\n\nThe first postmaster was John Baldwin, followed by E. H. Stoddard. Henry McCallen came next. Later William B. Stille was appointed and held the office until 1870, when Robert B. Stille was appointed. The latter died while a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1879, and John B. Vandegaer, the present master, was commissioned. In May, 1878, G. W. Small was mayor, and John Blake, clerk of the town of Many. J. B. Vandegaer, A. H. Hogue, E. B. Stille and J. P. Smith were councilmen. In 1880 J. B. Vandegaer was chosen mayor, and served until the council ceased to meet. Under the charter he is still mayor. J. D. Stille and Daniel Vandegaer were also members. Many Lodge No. 97 was a prosperous lodge from 1850 to 1872, when the charter was surrendered.\n\nKisatchie Lodge, at Mount Carmel, in 1859 continued in existence. Little Flock Lodge at Wineburg, in 1807, surrendered charter in 1878. The Church of San Miguel, at Adayes, within a mile of Robeline, was presided over in 1715 by Father Joseph Margil. The Church of Las Cabezas, on Bayou Scie (Vallecillo), is another old church, about equal distant from Many as that at Robeline. Then followed another church on Bayou Scie, called Nuestra Senora de la Guadalupe (the log buildings were standing in 1880). and in 1880 the Church of Nuestra Senora del Sagrado Corazon was erected, by Father Aubree. The Church of St. John at Many was erected by him in 1870, at a cost of about $2,000, on lands (14 acres) donated by W. H. Jack, of Natchitoches, P. Giauque, of Cincinnati, and Daniel Vandegaer. Among the members of the church at Many, in 1870, were the families of John Davis, John Buvens, Francis Buvens, John B. Vandegaer and Daniel Vandegaer, and to these families the building of the neat house of worship must be credited. The present congregation numbers about 250. The school (denominational) was established in September, 1887, with Miss Emma Curry, teacher, This lady presided here until 1889, when Miss Aimee Hertzog:, the present teacher, came. The enrollment shows forty pupils.\n\nPort Jesup was established as a frontier post in 1823. The adjutant's office was erected on the divide between the Red and Sabine Rivers, near the Natchitoches and San Antonio road, and here many of the officers, who in later years took part in the Mexican and Civil Wars, held command. Old Rough and Ready, Jefferson Davis, James Shields, Capt. May (the wild rider), Col. Many, Capt. Bragg, Gen. Grant and the gallant Phil Sheridan, were here, either as commandants or visitors. Shawnee Town and other trading villages were established outside the military reservation, along the Mexican trace, all making a settlement which became notorious from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Terrible tragedies were enacted in this vicinity in early years, and a thousand stories connect it with the romantic period in history. Sabine Lodge No. 75 (Masonic) was chartered March 4, 1850. In 1874 the life members were J. C. Armstrong and Leslie Barbee, past-masters, and J. H Martin.\n\nThe members were T. A. Armstrong, W. Y. Bainhill, J. H. Bozeman, T. Beck, S. D. Crump, S. M. Crump, J. Clark, A. E. Cassidy, C. B. Fleming, M. P. Hawkins, A. Harris, W. M. Lynch, J. T. Lynch, J. J. Mimms, J. P. March, E. P. Royston, J. E. Rogers, W. Stoker, H, P. Welch, J. W. Walker and J. W. Winn. The large Masonic hall was erected in 1877-78. Port, Jesup Masonic Institute was chartered May 5, 1887, by Lodge 75. On the spot where the college stands, Gen. Taylor had his quarters, and the water well, excavated by his orders, is today the supply well of the college. The directors of the institute in April. 1890, were J. P. Smith, president; J. M. Franklin, vice-president; L. Barbee, treasurer; T. J. Smith, W. D. Broughton and J. F. Vidler. T. E. Hardin was then president of the college.\n\nSodus is a modern railroad town in the northeast corner of the parish. Here are the Gooch, Davis, and Farmers' Co-operative Company's stores, and Dardy's hotel. Several substantial dwelling houses have been erected, and the town gives every evidence of progress.\n\nWilliam M. Antony, farmer and cotton ginner of Ward 2, of Sabine Parish, La., was born in the town of Negreet in 1827, being; a son of Christopher and Mileberry (Cook) Antony, who were born in Virginia and Georgia, the former in 1781, and the latter in 1805. When a small lad C. Antony was taken to Kentucky by his parents, and in that State he remained until about grown, when he went to Arkansas and was married in that State.\n\nIn 1821 be removed to Texas, and a year later to what is now Sabine Parish, La., and here married his second wife in 1820. He made his home in this parish until his death in 1841, being one of its very oldest American settlers at the time of his death. At first, the nearest trading point was Natchitoches, and the region, which was very heavily covered with timber, was teeming with wild beasts and Indians. He was the only one of his family who ever came to this State. His father was Martin Anthony (the name being formerly Anthony), a native German, who came to America prior to the Revolutionary War, in which he and his eldest son, Jacob, took part. The mother's father, Rev. William Cook, was born in Georgia. and was one of the first Baptist ministers of Northwestern Louisiana, having emigrated to what is now Sabine Parish, about 1825, his death occurring here in 1829, after a successful ministerial career. He had been a soldier in the War of 1812.\n\nThe subject of this sketch is the eldest of eight sons and two daughters, four of the family now living, all of whom were reared in the wilds of Sabine Parish, receiving such educational advantages as the primitive state of the country at that day afforded. In 1851 the daughter of Aaron L. and Penelope Neil became his wife, her name being Mary Alice. Mr. Neil was bora in Mississippi in 1808, and his wife in Alabama, their deaths occurring in 1872 and 1801, respectively, both passing from life in Mississippi, in which State they had spent the greater part of their lives. Mrs. Antony was born in that State, and her union with Mr. Antony has resulted in the birth of ten children; Thomas R., George C , Marion S., Charles W., Mary E. (wife of J. C. Salter), Mileberry (wife of C. M. Morris), being the only ones now living.\n\nSince his marriage Mr. Antony has resided in Ward 2, and since 1860 has been a resident of his present farm, which comprises 1,300 acres of land, about 200 of which are cleared, on which is erected a good steam cotton-gin, all of which property is the result of his own and his worthy wife's efforts. He was a police juror for some time prior to the war, and for a short time served as lieutenant in the Louisiana State troops and in the Second Louisiana Cavalry, but was soon after detailed to look after matters at home. He has been a member of Little Flock Lodge No. 180, of the A. F. & A. M., for some time, but since 1866 has been a member of that order, holding the rank of worshipful master since 1868. He and his wife are Methodists.\n\nL. Barbee, one of the pioneers and prominent citizens of Sabine Parish, was born in Wake County, N. C, January 16, 1812, and is a son of Mark and Tempey (Garner) Barbee, who were of English and Scotch descent, respectively. The parents were both natives of Virginia, the father born in 1776, and they both emigrated to North Carolina when young. There they were married, and there the father passed the closing scenes of his life. He was a farmer by occupation. They were the parents of six children, three of whom are now living: Polly (born in 1804), and Dorcas (born in 1810). Leslie, the youngest of this family and the subject of this sketch, passed his youthful days in North Carolina, received a fair education, and became familiar with the duties of the farm at an early age. In 1831 he emigrated to Greene County and Sumter County, Ala., and followed agricultural pursuits, and was overseer of a large plantation until 1842, when he emigrated to what is now Sabine Parish.\n\nThe country at that time was wild and unsettled, and the few settlers were miles apart. He lived in this manner until 1800, when he engaged in the mercantile business until 1887, but also engaged in tilling the soil. He moved to Fort Jesup, where he purchased another farm in 1800. He subsequently embarked in the mercantile business, and carried this on for eighteen years very successfully. He is also a mechanic, or what may be termed a \" Jack of all trades,\" and is successful in whatever he undertakes. He is now retired from business and is living on the fruits of his labor. Although in his seventy-eighth year, his memory is wonderful and his physical strength very good. He is unusually active for a man of his age, and bids fair to live many years more. He was postmaster at Fort Jesup for about eight years, was a member of the police jury for two years and represented Sabine Parish in the Legislature of 1878-79. He has been a prominent citizen all his life, and is probably the oldest man now living in Sabine Parish. He was married in 1838 to Miss Argenene Pillian, a native of Georgia, and the fruits of this union have been six children: Caroline (wife of M. P. Hawkins), Mary J. (wife of William McNeely), William H., Joseph L., Nellie (wife of W. A. Ponder), and Nettie (wife of A. L. Ponder). Mr. Barbee is a member of the Masonic fraternity and a charter member of Fort Jesup Lodge. He is also a worthy member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.\n\nRobert G. Brown, a native born resident of Sabine Parish, was born near where he now resides, on February 18, 1844, and is the second of eight children born to his parents, Charles E. and Martha J. (Pace) Brown, natives of Tennessee, the former born in Maury, and the latter in Montgomery County. Charles R. Brown went with his parents to San Augustine, Tex., while that State was a part of Mexico, but they were forced to leave on account, of political troubles, and he crossed the Sabine River to then Natchitoches Parish, a part of which afterward was organized into Sabine Parish, and remained there until his death in 1852. He was born in 1815. The mother came with her parents to Texas, and from thence moved to Louisiana, and there married Mr. Brown, and here the mother died in 1865. She was born; in 1820. After the death of her husband she married Wade Anderson, a well-known citizen of the community at that time.\n\nHe was an old settler and his death occurred on May 11, 1890, at the age of seventy-seven years. Robert G. Brown passed his boyhood and youth in Sabine Parish ( and in March, 1862, he enlisted in the Twelfth Louisiana Infantry, and served in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. He was in the following battles: Champion's Hill, Jackson, Corinth, Dallas, Atlanta, Franklin, Nashville, and then obtained a furlough to come home. After returning to the army he joined the Nineteenth Louisiana Infantry, and was with this until the close of hostilities. He came home without any means whatever, and had to assist in providing for his mother and stepfather for several years. He also attended school some and besides studied at home. In fact he has always been a student, and is a well informed man on any subject. He started out in life for himself as a farmer, and this vocation he has carried on ever since. In 1873 he opened a store in San Patricio, and has in connection with his farming interests carried this on successfully ever since. The post office, San Patricio, through Mr. Brown's efforts, was established in 1878, and he has been postmaster of the same since. He has been police juror for four years, and was justice of the peace one term. He has operated a steam gin, saw and grist-mill for ten years. He is the owner of 450 acres of land, but one time was the owner of a great deal more. In 1873 he was married to Miss Mary Pye, a daughter of John Pye, and a native of Sabine County, Tex. To this marriage have been born six children: Robert L., Mary E., Dempsey P., Jesse D., John E. and Winnie L. Mr. Brown is a member of the Baptist Church and takes a decided interest in the Sunday school work. In politics he is a Democrat, and is decidedly an anti-lottery man, belonging to the Anti-lottery League. He is an enterprising citizen.\n\nIsaac N. Carter, farmer and cotton-ginner of Ward 3, was born in Natchitoches Parish, La., in 1850, to Harmon and Martha A. (Estes) Carter, natives of Mississippi, who came with their parents to Natchitoches Parish, La., some fifty years ago, where they became acquainted and married. When the subject of this sketch was quite small they came to this parish, and settled at Negreet, where Mr. Carter died, in 1873, and his wife in 1871, members of the Baptist Church, and the former a farmer by occupation. He was also a lieutenant in the Confederate Army during the Rebellion, serving throughout the entire war. His father was one of the very earliest settlers of Natchitoches Parish, and there he passed from life. The maternal grandfather, William Dawson Estes, was also one of its earliest settlers, and is still living in this State. The subject of this sketch was the fifth child born to his parents, three now living, and as he was compelled to labor hard at farm work in his youth, he received but little schooling. At the age of eighteen years he began the battle of life , for himself, and in 1874 was married to Miss Ann ! E. daughter of Louis and Susan Schubrooks, the former of whom was born in Belgium, and died in Rapids Parish, La. His wife's birthplace was the State of Alabama, her death occurring in Sabine Parish. Mrs. Carter was born here, and her union with Mr. Carter has resulted in the birth of five children. Mr. Garter has resided on his present farm of 295 acres for the past fifteen years, and everything about his place shows thrift, enterprise and energy. By his efforts he has accumulated the property which he now owns, and is acknowledged to be one of the most progressive agriculturists of his ward, and has, on his plantation, a good, steam cotton gin and compress mill.\n\nHenry H. Cassel, police member and farmer, San Patricio, La. Mr. Cassel, whoso success in life is mainly due to his own industry and perseverance, coupled with a pleasant, genial disposition, is a native of Choctaw County, Miss., where he was born May 23, 1843. His parents, Eli M. and Sarah S. (Latham) Cassel, were natives of North Carolina and South Carolina, respectively. The parents were married in Mississippi, and resided in Choctaw County of that State until 1852, when they came to Louisiana, locating in Sabine Parish. The father died there, at the residence of our subject, in 1865, when about sixty-five years of age. He was left an orphan at an early age, and was reared by George Earnhardt, sheriff of his native county. He left there when sixteen years of age, engaged in tilling the soil, and this continued up to the time of his death. He was police member soon after coming to this parish, and this continued for many years. He was a devout member of the Methodist Church, and was class leader and steward in the same. It was thought that he was a member of the Masonic fraternity, and it is known that he was a lifelong Democrat. The mother is still living, and makes her home with her son, Henry H.\n\nShe was seventy-eight years of age last August, and is a member of the Missionary Baptist Church. Henry H. Cassel, the fifth in order of birth of the eight children born to his parents, passed his schooldays in Sabine Parish, and in 1861 he enlisted in Company A, Twelfth Louisiana Infantry, serving until the surrender, of Gen. Lee. He was in the following battles: Corinth, Baker's Creek, Jackson (Miss.), the Atlanta campaign, Franklin and Nashville. He was then taken sick at Charlotte, N. C., and there remained until the close of the war, when he returned home, and resumed his farming, which he has since continued.
