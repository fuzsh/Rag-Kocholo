        "text": "Graeme Hawkins\n\nFollowing a few days of clear skies, the chances of racing going ahead at Hollywoodbets Durbanville look reasonable, although there are showers forecast for today. The 10-race programme is scheduled to get under way at 12:15 with the running of a Maiden Plate (F&M) over 1000m. The presence of four well-bred debutantes from good draws does muddy the water somewhat, but on form From A Distance appears the one to beat. Runner-up in her last two starts and with Aldo Domeyer aboard, From A Distance appears to be the stable elect and could prove too good for Champagne Kisses, Elizabeth Grace and Timeline. The latter is one to watch out for, as she sports blinkers for the first time and could show significant improvement.\n\nThe second race and first leg of the Bipot, the R200 000 Restricted Maiden Plate over 1250m, sees King’s Quest go head-to-head with Captain West and Let It Be Said. But here again there are a few choicely bred newcomers with particular reference to On My Honour, My Archangel and Mr Fox. Interestingly, Grant Van Niekerk gets off the much improved Let It Be Said to ride My Archangel for the Lucinda Woodruff stable, and any market support must be respected. As we approach race time, the betting could well be the best guide as to how one structures the opening leg of the Bipot.\n\nCumbre Vieja looks the part in the third race, a Maiden Plate over 1400m. Trained by Vaughan Marshall, the son of Erupt has been knocking loudly at the door and the addition of blinkers to his equipment could see Cumbre Vieja hold sway over Arbitration and the potential improver Commander Green. Cumbre Vieja will be ridden by Sean Veale who has been riding up a storm across the country during the opening weeks of the new Season. Candice Bass-Robinson’s pair, Plus Four and Red Dawn, have the form to be in the mix but are drawn awkwardly.\n\nThe opening leg of the Pick 6, a Maiden Plate (F&M) over 1400m, looks competitive but the extremely well-bred Trippi filly, Little Suzie, should take a step forward from her promising debut when second behind Spoil Yourself at the country course at the beginning of the month. Little Suzie is out of the Met-winning mare Oh Susanna and from pole position she should get the run of the race. Festival Chic, White Waters (blinkers first time) and Pretty Precious have all shown promise while there could be improvement to come from Kortvandraad.\n\nGreen Mandarin will be looking to register his fourth consecutive victory when he takes on seven rivals in the sixth race, a Class 3 Handicap over 1800m, and the late-developing 5yo son of Gimmethegreenlight could defy a further 5-point hike in ratings. That said, Blue Bay is weighted to turn the tables on Green Mandarin but has not been seen since April. He is reported to be working well at home and a “competitive” run is expected by the Crawford stable. Otto Luyken is coming back to best form and is another to consider for all permutations.\n\nKing Pelles was an unlucky loser last time when beaten a nostril by Sudden Song and he could make amends in the seventh race over 2000m. Prime Venture let us down badly in that same race, but he came away with excuses and should do better here while Midway, a recent Maiden winner, appears to have a lot more improvement to come. The Rafeef filly, Heliotrope, is well handicapped in this Cape C Stakes event and cannot be ignored.\n\nCourse and distance suited Veronique is in good form at present and she could prove superior to her limited opposition in the eighth race, a Class 5 Handicap (F&M) over 1250m. The only other previous winner at Durbanville is Protect The Dream, who shed her maiden ticket at the third time of asking, but she may struggle to concede 7kgs to the more seasoned Veronique. These Class 5 Handicaps can produce strange results from time to time, but I am going to take my chances and row in with Veronique, who seems to get on really well with Grant Van Niekerk.\n\nThe ninth race on the card is extremely competitive but in the tenth race, a Cape B Stakes over 1000m, I have been waiting for Blue Holly to return to Durbanville where she has won three of her four starts to date over the minimum trip. Blue Holly faces a tough test here against the likes of Dean Street, Porque Te Vas and Franz Lehar but I am happy to take my chances with Blue Holly and suggest that the daughter of Gimmethegreenlight, trained by Glen Kotzen, could be one of the more appealing value bets for the afternoon.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/from-a-distance-can-prove-too-good-for-a-kiss/\n\nRACE 1\n\n8 FROM A DISTANCE comes back from a small break. She is in great form at the moment and should take a power of beating here. 10 CHAMPAGNE KISSES will need lots of luck from a tricky draw. She was still very green last time at the races; with natural improvement she will be the biggest danger to From A Distance. 7 ELIZABETH GRACE ran a cracking third last time behind a very smart filly. She is still improving with racing and should be right there at the finish. 5 TIMELINE will need to improve quite a bit to win here, but her recent form is good enough to see her amongst the places at best. (Brandon Bailey: 8 – 10 – 7 – 5)\n\nRACE 2\n\n3 KING’S QUEST will take a lot of beating from a good draw. He is way above average; he took off to run a cracking third on debut, and with natural improvement he should be a tough horse to beat. 2 DALMENY FACTOR caught the eye on debut when running on well to be beaten just over five lengths at the wire. He gets a good draw here, watch him closely. 9 CAPTAIN WEST will need all the luck in the world from a tricky draw. His first two runs have been excellent, and he looks ready to win soon. 7 LET IT BE SAID improved from his first run to finish a great second in his last start, he is going about his business the right way and should be involved in the finish with further improvement. (Brandon Bailey: 3 – 2 – 9 – 7)\n\nRACE 3\n\n8 CUMBRE VIEJA looks ready to win. The blinkers have been fitted, his form is very good, and he will be right there when it matters most. The drop in trip to 1400m will be no problem at all, if he gets the right run in transit, he should be a very hard horse to beat. 7 ARBITRATION comes to the track with a huge reputation, he is a lovely looking horse that will get better and better with racing. He moved up a winner in his last start before showing signs of possibly needing it a bit when becoming one paced the last 150m of the race. There is no doubt he will improve from that effort and must be included into all bet types. 2 COMMANDER GREEN has been rested after a very smart debut performance. He absolutely took off into the closing stages to run a great race. He gets a good draw here, watch him closely. 6 AMANCIO should prefer dropping to the 1400m trip, he might be able to sneak into the quartets on his best form at a decent price. (Brandon Bailey: 8 – 7 – 2 – 6)\n\nRACE 4\n\n5 PRETTY PRECIOUS steps back up in trip to 1400m where she ran a great second behind Ice Rain. She needed her last run quite badly from a small break where she travelled exceptionally well throughout her race before getting tired the last 150m. From a decent draw, she will be given every chance to exit the maidens. 1 LITTLE SUZIE is very well bred. Her debut run was magnificent when finishing second, now that she steps up in trip from a decent draw, she will be a huge threat to them all. 2 FESTIVAL CHIC is getting stronger and better with every run, she steps up in trip from a good draw which will help her chances. Include her into all your bets, she can most definitely win a race like this. 7 NATIONAL DISGRACE ran a much better race last time when finishing third. On her best form, she can sneak into the places. (Brandon Bailey: 5 – 1 – 2 – 7)\n\nRACE 5\n\nThis is a very tricky race. 3 HOLDING THUMBS travelled sweetly throughout his race last time when leading them from start to finish to win a good race. He still looks to be very progressive and must have a huge winning chance again from a good draw. 2 RADICCHIO won a gutsy race last time. He gets a perfect draw here; he shouldn’t be too far off them turning for home and he will have a good winning chance again. 9 DAS GUTE was a shock winner last time at a huge price. He seems to absolutely love Hollywoodbets Durbanville, watch him closely at a big price again. 5 MASTER OF PARIS never runs a bad race, he is very consistent, and he will have a good place chance again in this field. (Brandon Bailey: 3 – 2 – 9 – 5)\n\nRACE 6\n\n4 GREEN MANDARIN is in great form at the moment, he comes back to the races after a small break and if he doesn’t need the run badly, he could certainly win again. He is extremely versatile, and he can run on powerfully, include him into all your bets. 3 OTTO LUYKEN should run a cracker here. He should enjoy a good run throughout the race from a good draw, he likes to be up on speed, and he will keep fighting all the way to the line. 5 CORONATION TIME ran a much better race last time when finishing third, on his best form he would have a good place chance again. 2 SALVATOR MUNDI will need to improve quite a bit to win a race of this nature, if he can bring his last run to the races, he might be able to sneak into the quartets. (Brandon Bailey: 4 – 3 – 5 – 2)\n\nRACE 7\n\n5 PRIME VENTURE was very disappointing in his last start. He is much better than that effort, watch him late because he can run on powerfully in his races. 2 MIDWAY won his maiden really well last time, he looks to be progressive and this looks to be a nice race for him to be competitive again. Include him into all your bets. 7 KING PELLES has taken some time to find his feet in Cape Town, he was very unlucky last time when finishing second, if the race works out for him, he could certainly be a huge danger for them all. 1 BATON ROUGE is much better than his last run, he likes to race up on speed and if he gets away from the field at the right time, he will naturally have a good each way chance here. (Brandon Bailey: 5 – 2 – 7 – 1)\n\nRACE 8\n\nThis is not an easy race. Plenty with chances. 3 VERONIQUE from a good draw here must have a decent winning chance. She has been so consistent through her career, and this looks to be a nice race for her to win again. 5 ELECTRIC FEELS ran a lovely race last time when just finishing out of the places. She will have every chance here from a good draw, if she can bring that last run to Hollywoodbets Durbanville, she should have a good each way chance. 2 GRUE OF ICE will need to be at her absolute best to trouble the judge here. She gets a decent draw and a drop in rating which should help her chances. 12 TRES CHIC will need plenty luck from a terrible draw over this trip at Hollywoodbets Durbanville. She will probably drop out and do her best work at the finish, watch her closely for a storming finish late. (Brandon Bailey: 3 – 5 – 2 – 12)\n\nRACE 9\n\n4 WINTER PEARL ran a lovely race last time behind a decent sort. He gets a perfect draw here and there is no reason why he shouldn’t be on the premises again, he must have a good each way chance in this race. 6 SHIFTING PATH is in great heart at the moment, on his best form, he will have a good winning chance again in his career. 8 HANDSOME PRINCE is a lovely looking sort that we must watch closely leading up to the Cape summer season. He needed his last run badly and should tighten up quite a bit from that race. He may still need one more run before we see him at his best, but his class might pull him through here and he must go into all your bet types. 13 SPIRIT’S UNITE drops in trip here, from a bad draw he will need lots of luck, but there is no doubt he will be running on strongly from the back of the field, watch him late. (Brandon Bailey: 4 – 6 – 8 – 13)\n\nRACE 10\n\nAgain, it’s a tough race. 5 DEAN STREET won a great race last time at Hollywoodbets Kenilworth. He beat a competitive field on that occasion and from a decent draw here, he will have a good winning chance again. 8 GIMMELIGHTNING has been rested for 76 days, he likes to be held up for as long as possible and then come with a powerful finish late, on his recent form, he will have a good each way chance. 6 MOJO MAN wasn’t beaten far by Dean Street in his last start, and he is better off at the weights which will put him right in the race with a massive winning chance. Include him into all your bets. 2 BLUE HOLLY is a very speedy filly, she should run a much better race from a decent draw now that she is back at Hollywoodbets Durbanville. (Brandon Bailey: 5 – 8 – 6 – 2)\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/hollywoodbets-durbanville-saturday-17-august-2024-comments-by-brandon-bailey/\n\nPIRATE PRINCE with Rachel Venniker and his\n\ntrainer Alyson Wright in the number one box after\n\ntheir victory in the www.TabGold.co.za MR 86\n\nHandicap at Hollywoodbets Greyville yesterday.\n\nPicture: Candiese Lenferna\n\nAndrew Harrison\n\nPerennial favourite Mc Dazzler fluffed his lines once again as he was out-gunned in the finish of the first on the poly at Hollywoodbets Greyville yesterday. Sean Veale had the favourite in front turning for home and seemingly going great guns with Record High under the cosh from almost the jump.\n\nMc Dazzler started puffing over the final furlong as Record High responded to Tristan Godden’s relentless urgings and was able to make up the leeway and win going away as Mc lost his dazzle. Record High will probably improve as he goes further for Mike Miller. As for Dean Kannemeyer it’s a case of; does he sprint or does he stay. Mc Dazzler certainly didn’t see out the 1400 yesterday.\n\nIf Mc Dazzler let the side down, odds-on Deception Pass didn’t in the next as he broke a string of second placings. Muzi Yeni had nothing more to do than stay aboard and steer a straight course as Mike and Adam Azzie’s gelding made short work of the opposition with Yeni attributing bad luck in running to his mount’s previous disappointments.\n\nBurning Man, like Deception Pass, had to put a few demons to bed after a string of second placings and he did it in style as Yeni registered a quick double on Glen Kotzen’s gelding. Give an easy lead, Yeni played all on the break and although Godden tried his best to keep Bella’s Pablo in the hunt his supporters were resigned to their fate a long way out.\n\nIf Rachel Venniker had been able to claim her 1.5kg allowance at Ascot last weekend, Hayley Turner would have had no chance of winning the Silver Saddle as the best rider on the day. Venniker has proved herself internationally against some of the world’s best riders without her claim but in so called ‘women’s month’ in this country she is treated as inferior to her male counterparts by our far-sighted authorities.\n\nShe gave Pirate Prince the perfect ride for Alyson Wright who admitted post-race that Venniker’s 1.5kg allowance had swayed her decision in choices of jockeys with stable rider Athandiwe Mgudlwa on second choice Zakho who went walk-about in the market.\n\nA decisive move by Calvin Habib was ‘Doctor’s Orders’ as he got Mark Dixon’s filly to keep running and hold off a strong challenge from English Primrose with the balance of the field a long way back. It was a day of big winning margins up to this point and Dixon alluded to the fact that horses had to be handy on the day as the distances were more in keeping with a three-mile chase in the UK.\n\nShoefella record back-to-back wins for Peter Muscutt but it took a courageous decision by Tristan Godden to thread him through between Zoombomber and L’Ultimo crossing the subway. Godden had followed Wave Warrior and Zoombomber, who were racing alongside each other into the straight with L’Ultimo on their outside, anticipating an early gap. The gap failed to materialize and Godden, using the strapping son of Jackson as a wedge, forced Shoefella into a gap outside of Zoombomber in spite of the close attentions of Marco van Rensburg who did not make it easy in a subtle drift to his outside.\n\n‘Confidence’ is a word that will resonate with many a sport’s person and apprentice Brevan Plaatjies is never shy to put it out there. He rode a copybook race on Soho Star for Yogas Govender, tracking pacemaker Hippocrates and the two pulled clear in the straight. Both drifted to the outside, labelled the ‘Golden Highway’ by former riding great Anton Marcus, and they were not for the catching with the 4kg claim probably the difference between the two.\n\nMaster Bling, according to his trainer Garth Puller and rider Siphesihle Hlengwa, has been disappointing given his homework and his owners were all ready to bail. They may have changed their minds yesterday as Master Bling settled comfortably and motored home up the inside rail in the day-ending sprint. Hlengwa rode the prefect race but it was telling that when interviewer Paul Lafferty asked Puller, a master jockey in his time in the saddle, how he would have ridden he said, “I would win an 1800m race on him.”\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/deception-pass-bridges-the-gap/\n\nDavid Thiselton\n\nThe KZN Racing awards will be held on 30 August in the Classic Room at Hollywoodbets Greyville and there is going to be a quandary this year about the KZN Horse Of The Season just as there was last year.\n\nThe Horse Of The Year award, unlike the other awards, are open to horses from the yards of trainers who are not domiciled in KZN as long as the subject horse has had three or more runs in KZN. It can thus be won by an out of province horse who has excelled in KZN during the season. The other awards can only be won by horses from KZN yards, although Glen Kotzen and Dean Kannemeyer count as KZN yards because they have had satellite yards in KZN for many years.\n\nThe Horse Of The Year exclusion was probably made due to there not being a suitable candidate for some seasons in recent times. However, should not genuine KZN-trained horses like the Michael Roberts-trained See It Again last year and the Nathan Kotzen-trained Royal Victory this year be acknowledged in some way? Everybody in the industry would have viewed the former as the best horse from KZN in the 2022/2023 season, although the Peter Muscutt-trained Isivunguvungu could also have laid a claim, and this season Royal Victory is viewed by all and sundry as the best horse from KZN, although the Gareth van Zyl-trained Flag Man could also lay a claim having performed better on paper than Royal Victory in both the Gr 1 Hollywoodbets Durban July and Gr 1 wfa HKJC Champions Cup.\n\nThe Highveld racing awards could also potentially lead to an out of province horse being named Horse Of The Season. They are actually called the Highveld Feature Season awards as they go on performances of horses on the Highveld in features races during the season. Royal Victory was thus named the Champion Middle Distance Horse and Champion Older Male in the Highveld feature Season awards this year and he was only ousted in the Horse Of The Season award by the outstanding Mike de Kock-trained Gimme A Nother.\n\nHowever, the big difference is that the Highveld features only have a sprinkling of out of province horses competing in them. The Horse Of The Season award will virtually always be won by a Highveld horse and was this year it went to the outstanding Mike de Kock-trained Gimme A Nother, even though Royal Victory became the first out of province horse in history to win both of the Highveld’s biggest races, the Gr 1 Betway Summer Cup and the Gr 1 World Pool Premier’s Champions Challenge.\n\nThe KZN horses, on the other hand, have to compete with every champion from every province, because all champions from around the country descend on KZN for the three month long world famous racing festival, The Champions Season.\n\nLast year the Horse Of The Season was won by the Sean Tarry-trained Princess Calla, who won three Gr 1s in KZN during the season.\n\nThis year the favourite must be the Mike de Kock-trained Dave The King. He qualifies because he ran in KZN three times in the season and he won two open weight for age Gr 1s in KZN. He was in fact the only horse in the country to have won two open wfa Gr 1s last season.\n\nHowever, Royal Victory is a history-making KZN horse. On top of being the first out of province horse to do the Highveld double of the Summer Cup and Premier’s Champions Challenge, he is in fact the first out of province horse to have ever won the Premier’s Champions Challenge and the second out of province horse this millennium to have won the Summer Cup.\n\nHe could well go home empty-handed on KZN Awards night. If Dave The King is to be named Horse Of The Season then he must also surely be named Champion Older Male. Furthermore, the Dean Kannemeyer-trained Green With Envy ran three times in KZN during the season, so qualifies for awards as explained earlier by Kannemeyer’s KZN status, and like Royal Victory he won two middle distance Gr 1s during the season and one of them was in KZN, so he must be in pole position to win the Middle Distance award.\n\nSo the widely acknowledged best horse in KZN, Royal Victory, might be completely unacknowledged in his home province.\n\nThere are special awards occasionally put on at racing award ceremonies and this might be a case in point of creating one.\n\nHowever, what would probably be better considering the realities of racing in KZN during any given season, would be to create a new permanent award to acknowledge KZN’s best horse of the season. The award should only be open to horses from KZN yards.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/kzn-awards-horse-of-the-season-quandary/"
