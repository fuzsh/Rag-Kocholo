        "text": "Barre, VT – Thunder Road hosts a Memorial Day weekend race on Sunday, May 26th. BMU senior Luke Peters raced his Flying Tiger in the event. His car is a metric chassis Monte Carlo. Peters is an experienced racer and started in second of Heat Two. Unfortunately, his car had technical problems causing him to drop to the back of the heat where he finished seventh. He then came back out for the feature, but due to the problems the car was having, Peters would end up finishing 18th. Peters would later say, “The track was super different every time we went on, from the modifieds laying down a bunch of rubber, then during the heat race I had a hole in my right front tire so that didn’t go good and we didn’t have any info for going into the feature so we did a few last minute things and finished 18th.” It was a difficult day for Peters with all the problems the team and Peters experienced with the car and track, but the team would fix all that they could and would go back out on the track to battle advirsity to the best of their ability. Peters will continue racing for a full season at Thunder Road Speedbowl, White Mountain Motorsports Park and Oxford Plains Speedway."
