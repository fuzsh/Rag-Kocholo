She started blogging at age 13! I think it is wonderful to see someone so young sharing their passion with the world. She has almost 100 artists featured on her blog including amazing photographers like Sabine Peters from Germany, sculptures like Gustavo Aceves, and painters including Tony O'Connor. I wish her all the best and I want everyone to send her blog some love!\n\nhttps://theflyingshetlands.wordpress.com/"
