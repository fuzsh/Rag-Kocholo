        "meta_description": "Abstract. Regional land carbon budgets provide insights into the spatial distribution of\nthe land uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and can be used to evaluate\ncarbon cycle models and to define baselines for land-based additional\nmitigation efforts. The scientific community has been involved in providing\nobservation-based estimates of regional carbon budgets either by downscaling\natmospheric CO2 observations into surface fluxes with atmospheric\ninversions, by using inventories of carbon stock changes in terrestrial\necosystems, by upscaling local field observations such as flux towers with\ngridded climate and remote sensing fields, or by integrating data-driven or\nprocess-oriented terrestrial carbon cycle models. The first coordinated\nattempt to collect regional carbon budgets for nine regions covering the\nentire globe in the RECCAP-1 project has delivered estimates for the decade\n2000â2009, but these budgets were not comparable between regions due to\ndifferent definitions and component fluxes being reported or omitted. The recent\nrecognition of lateral fluxes of carbon by human activities and rivers that\nconnect CO2 uptake in one area with its release in another also requires\nbetter definitions and protocols to reach harmonized regional budgets that\ncan be summed up to a globe scale and compared with the atmospheric CO2 growth\nrate and inversion results. In this study, using the international initiative\nRECCAP-2 coordinated by the Global Carbon Project, which aims to be an update\nto regional carbon budgets over the last 2 decades based on observations\nfor 10 regions covering the globe with a better harmonization than the\nprecursor project, we provide recommendations for using atmospheric\ninversion results to match bottom-up carbon accounting and models, and we\ndefine the different component fluxes of the net land atmosphere carbon\nexchange that should be reported by each research group in charge of each\nregion.

        "text": "Bottom-up approaches encompass various methods to quantify regional C budgets and their component fluxes. There is no single observation-based bottom-up method that comprehensively gives all terrestrial CO2 or C fluxes. The currently incomplete scope of existing bottom-up estimates is a source of uncertainty when trying to combine top-down with bottom-up approaches or when using one of these approaches to verify the results of the other (Kondo et al., 2020; Ciais et al., 2020). For improving the completeness of regional bottom-up C budgets in RECCAP2, below we define a reasonable number of component C fluxes that can all be estimated from observations. In most cases, full observation-based estimates of component C fluxes are not feasible, but limited observations can be generally extrapolated using empirical models to the scale of RECCAP2 regions.\n\nFigureÂ 2 displays the required set of component C fluxes between the land and the atmosphere to be estimated for each region. No unique dataset or method is imposed to estimate each individual C flux, but we give references to existing datasets that already quantified those fluxes wherever possible. Two criteria informed the selection of C fluxes that we recommend for reporting in the RECCAP2 budgets: (1) there exists at least one estimate of each flux available at regional scale that can be used as a default tier in the case where no regional new estimate can be obtained, and (2) each flux is a non-negligible component of the global land C budget, typically an annual flux larger than 0.1âPgCâyrâ1, and thus cannot be ignored. If more detailed C fluxes are available for some RECCAP2 regions, we recommend these to be regrouped into the categories shown in Fig.Â 2 and for this grouping to be described.\n\nDownload\n\nThe general recommendation is to provide, where possible, several estimates for each C flux based on different approaches. This could take the form of ensemble medians and ranges from different models. In the case where one estimate is thought to be more realistic than others, for instance a model with a better score when benchmarked against observations or a higher spatial resolution dataset with better ground validation, the underlying reasons for preferring that estimate need to be explained based on peer-reviewed literature or evaluation. Uncertainty can be calculated from the spread of different estimates in those cases where the state of knowledge cannot establish that one estimate is better than another. The use of IPCC methods (Mastrandrea et al., 2011) and uncertainty language (http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/climdyn2013/IPCC/IPCC_WGI12-IPCCUncertaintyLanguage.pdf, last access: NovemberÂ 2021âââââââ) is recommended when different estimates of the same component C flux are available. If different estimates report their own uncertainty, either based on data or an evaluation of the method used, e.g., by performing sensitivity analysis through changing model parameters, input datasets, or randomly varying input data, this information should be used to evaluate consistency between estimates, given their uncertainties. It is recommended to use the word âuncertaintyâ when comparing different estimates and âerrorâ for the difference between an estimate and true values. Because âtruthâ is unknown for component C fluxes at the scale of large regions, errors cannot be estimated in RECCAP2.\n\n3.1âNet carbon stock change\n\nThe net carbon stock change of terrestrial ecosystems C pools in a region (ÎC in Fig.Â 2) can be obtained by repeated inventories of live biomass, litter (including dead biomass), soil carbon, and carbon stock change in wood and crop products. None of the RECCAP2 region has a complete gridded inventory of all carbon stocks and their change over time. Some regions, like North America, China, Europe, and Russia have forest biomass inventories that were established long ago by forest resource agencies (Goodale et al., 2002; Pan et al., 2011). A few countries, e.g., England and Wales (Bellamy et al., 2005) and France (Martin et al., 2011), have repeated soil C inventories that allow trends to be quantified. Other countries have one-off soil carbon inventories (e.g., US, Australia, Germany). Many regions are able to make estimates of carbon stocks in products from forestry, wood use, and crop production statistics.\n\nFor RECCAP2, we recommend that each region reports carbon stock changes in all the listed terrestrial ecosystem aggregated pools in Fig.Â 2, namely ÎCforest, ÎCcroplands, ÎCgrasslands, and ÎCothers, and specify which sub-pools are include in each case. The sub-pools can include, but are not limited to, the following sources: biomass, litter and woody debris, and soil mineral and organic carbon. Where attribution of these pools or sub-pools to biomes, land cover types, or political units is made by a regional synthesis group, the corresponding areas involved must be systematically reported. This includes the definition of the reporting depth for soil C stocks (0â30 and 0â100âcm are recommended). The choice of how many biomes are reported needs to balance data availability with the importance of carbon stock and carbon stock changes within particular biomes (typically a reported biome should contribute at least 10â% of the regional C changes). Regions with significant wetland C or permafrost C stocks may report this C stock separately, especially in cases where the areas involved occur in different biomes, but this must be done in a way that allows the C stocks to be subtracted from the biome total or added back into it without double counting. The area of biomes for which no carbon storage or carbon storage change is available needs to be reported, and a default value of â9999 should be given to such stocks and their stock change value. The biomes with no data can be specified (preferable if the area and stock involved is potentially large, since this identifies gaps needing future work) or simply lumped under âothersâ if they are minor.\n\nThe net C stock change of biological product pools also needs to be reported for crops, wood, and other carbon-containing products (see Fig.Â 2). The depletion of peat C stocks for use as a fuel (ÎCpeat use in Fig.Â 2), thus causing C emissions to the atmosphere, was significant in the early 20th century in some northern countries and still is today in few countries (Conchedda and Tubiello, 2020). It should be reported where relevant using regional data if available (Joosten, 2009). In the case of C stock change in wood products (ÎCwood products), if possible the change in those wood products in use (e.g., construction, paper) should be reported separately from those in waste undergoing decay (e.g., landfills). The names and definitions of the wood product pools considered should be specified. The C stock change of crop product pools (ÎCcrop products) is usually small on an annual timescale. It can be reported if data are available, otherwise a value of zero can be assumed. The net carbon stock change of organic carbon accumulation in lakes and reservoirs (known as burial ÎCburial) should be reported based on regional data or global estimates (MendonÃ§a et al., 2017; Maavara et al., 2017).\n\n3.2âLateral displacement fluxes within and between regions\n\nOne of the reasons why net landâatmosphere C exchange that excludes fossil fuel emissions, hereafter called net ecosystem exchange (NEE), of a region is not equal to the net carbon stock change in the same region is because of lateral C fluxes, as alluded to in Sect.Â 1.5. Carbon is lost by each region to the adjacent estuaries through river export and is lost or gained through the trade of crop, wood, and animal products and through the atmospheric transport and deposition of C particles emitted with dust in dry regions. In order to allow the net C stock change estimates to be corrected, we recommend that lateral fluxes in and out of each RECCAP2 region be reported. The main ones are river C export and those from wood and crop trade, as denoted by the red arrows in Fig.Â 2. A strong point of the RECCAP2 project is an attempt at mass balance closure between pools and fluxes. Therefore, lateral displacement fluxes of C within each region but between pools denoted by the brown arrows in Fig.Â should also be reported or calculated by mass balance. More details on these fluxes is given below.\n\n3.2.1âRiverine carbon export to estuaries and the coastal ocean\n\nLateral C export fluxes in rivers (Frivers in Fig.Â 2) should be reported at the interface between rivers and estuaries. We recommend to top the âlandâ at the mouth of rivers and to take estuaries being coupled to the coastal ocean by dynamical and biogeochemical processes as âblue carbonâ in RECCAP2. Mangroves and salt marshes export large fluxes of dissolved and particulate C produced in upland systems or within riverine systems to estuaries and the coastal ocean (Bauer et al., 2013). These fluxes determine the carbon budget of the aquatic coastal margin ecosystems, and we recommend that they should also be considered âblue carbonâ. River C fluxes at the river mouth into estuaries can be estimated from dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration data for the rivers involved and the associated river flow rates (Ludwig et al., 1998; Mayorga et al., 2010; Dai et al., 2012). Few RECCAP2 regions (Fig.Â 1) receive C from rivers entering their territory. If this is the case, this input of flux of fluvial carbon from rivers should be reported, even though it is not represented in Fig.Â 2 for simplicity. Evasion from aquatic systems to the atmosphere is treated in Sect.Â 2.2.7.\n\n3.2.2âInputs of carbon to riverine from soils and weathered rocks\n\nThe inland water carbon cycle receives C leached or eroded from soils as an input. This carbon can be redeposited and buried in the freshwater ecosystems, outgassed to the atmosphere, or exported to estuaries and the coastal ocean. This flux is called Fbio river input in Fig.Â 2. It cannot be measured directly at large spatial scales. We therefore recommend calculating it by using mass balance as the sum of burial, outgassing, and export. Similarly, weathering processes consume atmospheric CO2 (see Sect.Â 2.7). This C is subsequently delivered as dissolved bicarbonate ions to rivers. At the global scale and over long timescales, two-thirds of the average proportion of bicarbonate in waters is derived from atmospheric C with the final third being from lithogenic C. We recommend calculating this weathering-related DIC flux, called Flitho river input in Fig.Â 2, by using geological maps and global weathering rates (Hartmann et al., 2009).\n\n3.2.3âCarbon fluxes in and out each region due to trade\n\nNet trade-related C fluxes for wood and crop products exchanged by each region with other regions need to be reported in C units using statistical economic data about the trade volume and the carbon content of each product. These are available from regional datasets (or using FAOSTAT and GTAP data) or the global dataset of Peters et al.Â (2012). This net trade flux should be reported separately for crop products and wood products (Fcrop trade and Fwood trade in Fig.Â 2). If the amount is relevant, it can be reported for animal products as well, but this flux is much smaller than that in crops and wood and is therefore not shown in Fig.Â 2. Our best-practice recommendation is to separate the net trade C flux into gross fluxes of imports and exports. The list of commodities included and ignored should be specified where they are material; commodities making a small contribution can be lumped under âotherâ. Quantification of carbon fluxes due to trade of unburned fossil fuels can be reported if data are available.\n\n3.2.4âCrop and wood product transfers within in each region\n\nFigureÂ 2 links the C stock change of terrestrial ecosystem pools to the change of C storage in biological wood products by the harvest and lateral displacement of crop and wood. The harvest of grass for foraging can be assumed to be given to animals locally and can be included in Fgrazing (see details in Sect.Â 2.4). We recommend reporting the total amount of C harvested as wood and crops in each region as Fwood harvest and Fcrop harvest (Fig.Â 2), respectively. Subtracting trade fluxes from the harvest fluxes will provide the C flux displaced within each region for domestic activities. Note that non-harvested and non-burned residues for crops and forest harvesting, such as slash and felling losses, should not be part of the harvest flux and should instead be counted as part of FLUC and Fland management. We note that this locally decomposing flux is globally large, in the year 2000 it amounted to 1.5âPgCâyrâ1 for crop residues and 0.7âPgCâyrâ1 for felling losses in forests (Krausmann et al., 2013).\n\n3.3âNet ecosystem exchange\n\nMore than a decade ago there were a number of papers trying to reconcile different definitions of land carbon fluxes, including the papers by Schulze et al.Â (2000), Randerson et al.Â (2002), and Chapin et al.Â (2006). Schulze et al.Â (2000) focused on the importance of accounting for disturbance C losses at site scale when considering an ecosystem over a long time period and hence separating net ecosystem production (NEP, i.e., gross primary productivity minus ecosystem respiration) from net biome production (NBP or net biome productivity, i.e., NEP minus disturbance emissions). Randerson et al.Â (2002) argued that the net carbon balance should be described by a single name, NEP, provided that this flux includes all carbon gains and losses at the spatial scale considered. Finally, Chapin et al.Â (2006) in a âreconciliationâ paper proposed the use of net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) for the net C balance of ecosystems at any given spatial or temporal scale and the restriction of the use of NEP to the difference between gross primary productivity minus ecosystem respiration. These three definitions consider the C balance from the point of view of ecosystems. Here we seek to estimate the atmospheric C balance of ecosystems at the spatial scale of large regions and the temporal scale of 1 decade, and we call this net ecosystem exchange (NEE). NEE is defined as the exchange of all C atoms between a land region and the atmosphere over it, excluding fossil fuels and cement production emissions. We use a similar definition to Hayes and TurnerÂ (2012), but extend it to include natural geological emissions and sinks, acknowledging that geological fluxes are not from ecosystems per se. NEE includes biogenic atmospheric emissions of CO, CH4, and VOCs, all expressed in C units. This definition of NEE matches the landâatmosphere flux of total C that inversions estimate, provided they account for CO2, CH4, CO, and VOC fluxes. NEE cannot be derived using the bottom-up approach from a single observation-based approach.\n\nWe acknowledge that the geological fluxes are not strictly speaking from ecosystems, and we could therefore have called this flux net terrestrial carbon exchange rather than NEE, but the former terminology could be ambiguous since some might assume that it includes fossil fuels and cement. NEE also includes biogenic emissions of CO, CH4, and VOCs, all expressed in C units. This definition of NEE matches the landâatmosphere flux of total C that inversions estimate, provided they account for CO2, CH4, CO, and VOC fluxes. NEE cannot be derived using the bottom-up approach from a single observation-based approach. Various bottom-up datasets and methods must be combined to obtain each component flux, and those fluxes can be summed up to NEE.\n\nWe recommend that when a component C flux of NEE contains meaningful amounts of C emitted as CO, CH4, and VOCs, the type and fraction of reduced carbon compound emitted should be reported. For instance, Fgrazing emits carbon partly as CH4; Ffires emits CO (and a smaller component of CH4), VOCs, and CH4; Fwood products emits CO when burned and CH4 when the products decay in landfills (see Sect.Â 2.5); Frivers outgas, Flakes outgas, and Festuaries outgas emit CH4 (see Sect.Â 2.6); and Fgeological emissions emit CH4 and CO2 (see Sect.Â 2.7). The CO2 and reduced C composition of each flux should be reported separately for clarity, with both expressed in C units. This level of detail in the reporting will allow a precise comparison with inversion fluxes (see Sect.Â 1).\n\nIn Fig.Â 2, the component fluxes that sum to NEE are subdivided for four sub-systems: terrestrial ecosystems, biological products, inland waters, and geological pools (excluding those mined for fossil fuel and cement production). The section below describes the C flux components of NEE in each sub-system.\n\n3.4âComponent fluxes of net ecosystem exchange for terrestrial ecosystems\n\n3.4.1âNet primary productivity\n\nNet primary productivity (NPP) is the flux of carbon transformed into biomass tissues after fixation by GPP. In RECCAP-2 we recommend reporting GPP but focus on NPP as the relevant input flux of carbon to terrestrial systems. NPP can be measured in the field using biometric methods, but this method does not measure non-structural carbohydrates or NPP-acquired carbon lost to exudates, herbivores, leaf DOC leaching, biogenic VOC emissions, and CH4 emission by plants (Barba et al., 2019). Field measurements thus estimate the biomass production (BPE is the sum of carbon in leaves, wood, and roots), which is lower than NPP. Different satellite products provide global maps of NPP for the past decades, but the conversion of GPP to NPP is usually made by an empirical carbon use efficiency model (ratio of GPP to NPP) like the BIOME-BGC model for the GIMMS-NPP (Smith et al., 2016) and for MODIS-NPP (Running et al., 2004) or the BETHY-DLR (WiÃkirchen et al., 2013ââââââââââââââ) global products. Field estimates of BPE can also be combined with satellite products of GPP to derive NPP (Carvalhais et al., 2014). Discussing uncertainties of satellite NPP and GPP products is not in the scope of this report, but light use efficiency formulations used in many datasets tend to ignore the effect of CO2 fertilization and soil moisture deficits, which has motivated attempts to use data-driven models or hybrid models combining process-based leaf-scale photosynthesis models with satellite data, e.g., FAPAR, like in the P-MODEL (Stocker et al., 2019) or the BESS model for GPP (Jiang and Ryu, 2016). Those models assimilate satellite observations but include the effects of CO2, diffuse light, or water stress on photosynthesis.\n\nAdditional methods can be used to estimate regional NPP. For crop NPP, aggregated estimates can be obtained from yield statistics and allometric expansion factors (Wolf et al., 2011), the spatial scale being the one at which yield data can be collected (e.g., farm, county, province, country). For forest NPP, woody NPP can be obtained from forest inventories, with some of the sites having several decades of measurements to enable studies of trends. The recommendation for RECCAP2 is to document the definition of NPP in the datasets that will be used for each region and the ecosystems covered in the case of NPP estimates limited to specific ecosystems as precisely as possible . It also needs to be made explicit how NPP datasets were obtained and what their possible limitations are. We recommend that NPP (rather than GPP) should be reported for each region, given that C from NPP links directly to biomass and soil C inputs and to partial appropriation by humans and animals in managed ecosystems, due to the fact that harvested C is further displaced laterally and turned into emissions of C to the atmosphere where it is used.\n\n3.4.2âCarbon emissions from soil heterotrophic respiration (SHR)\n\nSoil heterotrophic respiration (SHR) is the C emitted by decomposers in soils and released to the atmosphere. Up until recently, this flux could not be estimated directly, but the availability of point-scale measurements from 6000 sites for total soil respiration and â500 sites for heterotrophic respiration in the peer-reviewed literature used by the SRDB 4.0 database (Bond-Lamberty, 2018) allows for regional and global upscaling of this flux for averages over a given period (Hashimoto et al., 2015; Konings et al., 2019; Warner et al., 2019) or with annual variations (Yao et al., 2021) that can be used for RECCAP2.\n\n3.4.3âCarbon fluxes from land use change and land management\n\nThe net land use change flux, called FLUC, includes C gross fluxes exchanged with the atmosphere from gross deforestation, legacy and instantaneous soil CO2 emissions, forest degradation emissions, and sinks from post-abandonment regrowth and afforestation and reforestation activities (Houghton et al., 2012). This flux can be positive or negative depending on the region considered and the balance of gross fluxes. The net land use change flux results from changes in NPP, SHR, and deforestation fires over areas affected by land use change in the past. Attribution by cause is, in this case, relevant to evaluate the human impact on terrestrial CO2 exchange and to inform policy making. In absence of local NPP and SHR measurements over areas subject to land use change, especially at the scale of RECCAP-2 regions, FLUC should be treated as a separate flux component of NEE in each region. FLUC is widespread in all RECCAP2 regions and highly uncertain, and its estimates depend on the approach used. The different terms and definitions used to estimate FLUC need to be clearly defined to avoid counting the fluxes twice within the regional budgets. More details about the calculation of FLUC are given in Sect.Â 4 since estimates depend on the method used.\n\nThe carbon flux exchanged with the atmosphere from management processes, called Fmanagement, includes a wide range of forest, crop, and rangeland management practices. It is extremely difficult to separate Fmanagement from FLUC as it would require the quantification of C fluxes from land use change, followed by no management of the new land use in FLUC and C fluxes from additional management activities on top of land use change. In practice, bookkeeping models of FLUC include management of new land use types in the empirical data they use. Fire is also commonly used in land management and for deforestation, but it is only implicitly included in FLUC estimates. For instance, forest to cropland land use emissions are based on empirical observations of soil C changes in croplands from multiple sites, which implicitly include tillage, fertilization, cultivars, and biomass burning effects but do not separate each of these practices explicitly in each region due to a lack of data.\n\nLikewise, Fmanagement is not simulated separately in global studies based on dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and the effects of management are included in FLUC instead, based on the idealized parameterizations of management practices (Arneth et al., 2017). For croplands, DGVMs include crop harvest preventing the return of residues to soils, and some models represent tillage (Lutz et al., 2019) and changes in fertilization (Olin et al., 2015). To our knowledge, there is no DGVM simulating the effect of irrigation, changes of cultivars and rotations (cover crops), and conservation agriculture on C fluxes. For fires, management activities such as deforestation fires or fire prevention are usually not represented, although population density maps are used to modulate ignitions. For managed forests, several global models that include wood harvest (Arneth et al., 2017; Yue et al., 2018) as a forcing do not have a detailed representation of practices, mainly due to the lack of forcing data, although management is represented in some regions (Luyssaert et al., 2018). For pastures, few models include variable grazing intensity, fertilization, and forage cutting (Chang et al., 2015). In addition to structural DGVM limitations and a lack of representation of management precluding an estimate of Fmanagement, there is also no framework to perform factorial simulations with and without land use change and management that would allow us to separate Fmanagement and FLUC.\n\nFLUC and Fmanagement are accounted for by UNFCCC national communications of C fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sector for managed lands. UNFCCC national communications report land use change emissions in their Common Reporting Format (CRF) communications for different bidirectional land use transitions. These estimates of FLUC have a different system boundary from those simulated by bookkeeping models (Grassi et al., 2018; Hansis et al., 2015; Houghton and Nassikas, 2017). National communications following the IPCC guidelines (Dong et al., 2006) usually do not consider FLUC from land use that occurred more than 20Â years before the reporting period, whereas bookkeeping models and DGVMs consider all land use transitions that occurred since 1700âCE. On the other hand, national communications include FLUC from the expansion of urban areas, which is ignored in bookkeeping models and DGVMs. In national communications, Fmanagement as defined here is not separately estimated. Its effect is implicitly included in the LULUCF sector based on empirical emission factors that include management practices of the new land use types in reports of C fluxes of stable land use types (e.g., cropland remaining croplands). Since 75â% of the global land ecosystems are managed (Ellis et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2016), it will be a major challenge for RECCAP2 to comprehensively account for FLUC and Fmanagement and even more challenging to reach a harmonized method for comparing estimates between regions. We thus recommend for each synthesis chapter to describe the components of FLUC and Fmanagement as precisely as possible and to explain in which cases they are combined together. Note that it is recommended that the emissions of wood products, crop products, and grazing are reported as separate fluxes. If they are provided as part of FLUC and Fmanagement they should thus be identified separately.\n\n3.4.4âCarbon emissions from fires\n\nThis flux, called Ffires, represents the emission of all carbon species to the atmosphere from wildfires, prescribed fires, biomass burning, and biofuel burning, including CO2, CO, CH4, and black carbon, separated if possible into crop residue burning and other fires. The burning of crop residues occurs though small-scale fires, which continue to be underestimated by global satellite burned area products. Further, some residues are burned out of the field, and those emissions are not measurable with satellites. Burning emissions from crop residues can be calculated from fuel consumption and carbon emission factors. Emissions from other fires can be estimated by ground-based and aerial surveys (several countries perform such surveys) or from satellite-based datasets based on burned areas, such as GFED (van der Werf et al., 2010) (https://www.globalfiredata.org, last access: NovemberÂ 2021âââââââ), or based on fire radiative power, such as GFAS (Di Giuseppe et al., 2018). The Global Fire Emission Database version 4.1s (GFED4.1s) is an update of the GFED3 product with an updated burned area and is complemented by an active fire detection algorithm that improves detection of small fires (van der Werf et al., 2017). In tropical regions, deforestation causes fires (including peat fires in Southeast Asia). It is important here to avoid double accounting by checking in each region if C emissions from deforestation fires were already included in land use change emissions (FLUC), and if this is the case these must be subtracted from Ffires. A possible approach here is to separate fire emissions over intact, transitional, and managed lands if spatially explicit datasets for managed lands are available (TableÂ 1).\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\n3.4.5âCarbon emissions from insects grazing and disturbances\n\nThis flux, called Finsects, represents C emissions to the atmosphere associated with background grazing and sporadic outbreak of insects. It is a significant C emission in regional budgets, though it is usually ignored, but it may be estimated as a fraction of NPP or leaf biomass if data is available and provided there is no double counting. Insect outbreaks (Kautz et al., 2017) cause direct and committed emissions to the atmosphere beyond the background grazing of a fraction of biomass as they partly destroy foliage or cause tree morality (e.g., bark beetles in Canada, Kurz et al., 2008) that induces legacy emissions that can last for several decades. To our knowledge, only a few regions have estimates of insects-disturbance-induced C emissions at a regional scale, e.g., the US (Williams et al., 2016), Canada, and some countries in Europe, and this component flux may not be possible to estimate for each RECCAP2 region (particularly in tropical regions).\n\n3.4.6âCarbon emissions from reduced carbon species\n\nThis flux, called Freduced, is the sum of emissions to the atmosphere of reduced C compounds, including biogenic CH4, non-methane biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), and biogenic CO (excluding fires). Carbon emitted as CH4 by wetlands, termites, and rice paddy agriculture sources and removed by soils can be estimated by bottom-up approaches, e.g., synthesized in the global CH4 budget or from atmospheric CH4 inversions in the case where those inversions report those flux components separately (Saunois et al., 2020). In the framework proposed here, CH4 emissions from crop and wood products in landfills are counted as Fcrop products and Fwood products, and CH4 carbon from animals and manure is counted in Fgrazing. Emissions of carbon from BVOCs and CO by the vegetation can be obtained from models used to simulate those fluxes for atmospheric chemistry after conversion into units of carbon mass. For instance, the CLM-MEGAN2.1 model (Guenther et al., 2012) estimates biogenic emissions of CO and of â¼150Â BVOC compounds, with the main contributions being from terpenes, isoprene, methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, Î±-pinene, Î²-pinene, t-Î²-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene.\n\n3.4.7âCarbon emissions from biomass grazed by animals\n\nThis flux, called Fgrazing, represents the C emission that incurs from the consumption of herbage by grazing animals, including the decomposition of animal products used in the bio-economy, the decomposition of manure, and direct animal emissions from digestion. Only the fraction of manure from animals grazing on grass should be accounted for because C emitted from manure originating from crop products given to animals is already included inFcrop products. Grass requirements by animals can be derived from grass biomass use datasets (Herrero et al., 2013). Grass biomass use per grazing animal head in a region can be calculated based on data of total metabolizable energy (ME) of ruminants in each region. Actual grass intake can be derived from empirical models or from vegetation models that include management of pasture (Chang et al., 2016). Carbon emitted from grazed grass biomass includes CH4 emissions from manure C (excreta) and from enteric fermentation, animal CO2 respiration from grass intake, and C emissions from the consumption and decay of meat and milk products derived from grass grazing. The C in milk, animal, and manure products can be assumed to decay in 1 year and to be emitted as C to the atmosphere. Here âanimalsâ are domestic or wild mammals but not insects.\n\n3.5âComponent fluxes of net ecosystem exchange from biological products\n\n3.5.1âCarbon emissions from crop biomass consumed by animals and humans\n\nThis flux, called Fcrop products, represents the carbon emissions to the atmosphere from the consumption of harvested crop products. It can be calculated from agricultural statistics as the sum of domestically harvested products minus net export minus storage in each region. Crop products are consumed both by animals (including wild animals) and humans, and a distinction may be made between these two groups of consumers if additional data on consumption type are available in each region. The digestion of crop products by ruminants emits CH4 carbon and double-counting must be avoided in case this CH4 and C flux is included in another C flux like ruminant methane emissions. A fraction of C in consumed crop products is also channeled to sewage systems and lost to rivers as DOC instead of being emitted to the atmosphere (globally 0.1âPgCâyrâ1; Regnier et al., 2013). Although it is a small flux, we recommend including it in regional budgets if data are available. River CO2 outgassing flux estimates should contain the fraction of this sewage C flux returned back to the atmosphere.\n\n3.5.2âCarbon emissions from harvested wood products used by humans\n\nThis flux, called Fwood products decay, represents a net carbon emission to the atmosphere from the decay and burning of harvested wood products used for paper, furniture, and construction. The emission from decay, Fwood products decay, can be calculated with models of the fate of wood products in the economy, e.g., EggersÂ (2002), Mason Earles et al.Â (2012), forced by input to product pools from domestic harvest of non-fuel wood and net export of wood products. The small fraction of wood product waste going to sewage waters and rivers can also be estimated if relevant data are available. If Fwood products decay is calculated in carbon units, e.g., from a model of wood product pools, it also includes carbon lost to the atmosphere as CH4 in landfills, thus double-counting must be avoided in case CH4 and C emissions from wood in landfills are also reported separately in a region. The flux from burning of wood products, Fwood product burning, can be estimated from statistics of fuel wood consumption and carbon emission factors during combustion (including CO2, CO, and CH4). This flux should include emissions from commercial fuel wood burned to produce electricity, non-commercial fuel wood gathered locally and burned in households, and fuel wood burned as a fuel by industry. It is important to note that we recommend to report Fwood products decay here for each RECCAP2 region as a separate flux. This term is usually included in FLUC in C budget studies based on DGVMs and bookkeeping models (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). It should then be removed from currently reported estimates of FLUC in order to avoid double-counting.\n\n3.6âComponent fluxes of net ecosystem exchange for inland waters\n\nCarbon emissions from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs\n\nTheâââââââ fluxes, called Frivers outgas and flakes plus reservoirs outgas in Fig.Â 2, correspond to those from the outgassing of C from lakes and rivers, respectively. There are two global observation-based estimates of this flux calculated using the same GLORICH river pCO2 database but with different data selection criteria and upscaling techniques. That of Raymond et al.Â (2013) was produced using the COSCAT regions that represent groups of watersheds and can be re-interpolated to the RECCAP2 regions. That of Lauerwald et al.Â (2015) was produced on a 0.5ââÃâ0.5â global grid and does not include lakes. Gridded CO2 emissions of boreal lakes have been estimated separately by Hastie et al.Â (2018) using an empirical model trained on pCO2 data from mainly Swedish and Canadian lakes. The riverine CO2 evasion outgassing flux from Lauerwald et al.Â (2015) is about half that of Raymond et al.Â (2013) due to lower estimates of average river pCO2 for the tropics and Siberia resulting from a more restrictive data selection process and additional averaging effects from the statistical model applied. In addition, the estimates by Lauerwald et al.Â (2015) do not account for CO2 emissions from headwater streams, which may be substantial. For instance, Horgby et al.Â (2019) estimated that mountain streams alone emit about 0.15âPgCâyrâ1 globally. Some land models have been developed to include the land to ocean loop of the carbon cycle, and their output may be used to assess river and lake CO2 evasion fluxes for selected regions (Hastie et al., 2019) or the globe. These models have also confirmed previous observational findings (e.g., Borges et al., 2015) that river floodplains are a potentially significant yet overlooked component of the inland water C budget. Up until now, however, only CO2 outgassing from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs has been considered in regional C budgets. New synthesis estimates of CH4 emissions from those inland waters are now available from the CH4 budget synthesis (Saunois et al., 2020), and we recommend that this source in C units should be added to Frivers outgas and Flakes+reservoirsâ outgas.\n\n3.7âComponent fluxes of net ecosystem exchange from geological pools\n\n3.7.1âGeological carbon emissions\n\nThis flux, called Fgeological emissions, corresponds to natural emissions of CO2 and CH4 from geological pools. The Earth's degassing of geological carbon consists of geogenic CO2 emissions of 0.16âPgCâyrâ1 (MÃ¶rner and Etiope, 2002), microbial oxidation of rock carbon (Hemingway et al., 2018), and CH4 emission estimated to be 0.027âPgCâyrâ1 (Etiope et al., 2019), which has recently been revised (Hmiel et al., 2020) to a smaller value of 0.0012âPgCâyrâ1. Geogenic CH4 and C land emissions are from volcanoes, mud volcanoes, geothermal sources, seeps, and micro-seepage, and if the gridded dataset of Etiope et al.Â (2019) is used, we recommend removing the marine coastal seepage CH4 and C emissions reported separately in this dataset. Geogenic CO2 and C emissions are almost exclusively related to geothermal and volcanic areas (high-temperature fluidârock interactions, crustal magma, and mantle degassing). We suggest here to report these fluxes if there is a published estimate in the region considered.\n\n3.7.2âWeathering uptake of atmospheric CO2\n\nThis flux, called Fweathering uptake, corresponds to the weathering of carbonate and silicate rocks, which is a net sink of atmospheric CO2 and corresponds to C then transferred by rivers to the ocean. We recommend that these fluxes should be reported for each region as they are needed to rigorously compare the output of CO2 inversions (which cover all CO2 fluxes) with bottom-up NEE estimates (Fig.Â 2). This can be achieved using the global dataset from Hartmann et al. (2009) and the gridded product of Lacroix et al. (2020) for instance. Weathering of cement is represented in Fig.Â 2 and should be reported as part of fossil fuel emissions, which is not within the scope of this paper.\n\nFluxes from land use change and management (abbreviated to FLUC and defined as having a positive sign for net fluxes from the atmosphere to the land C) are defined as changes in C stocks due to deforestation, forest degradation and afforestation or reforestation, wood harvest, subsequent regrowth of forest following harvest or agriculture abandonment, conversion between croplands and grasslands (also sometimes called pastures or, more generally, rangelands), and management practices such as shifting cultivation (land cyclically rotating between forest and agriculture). Where applicable, peat burning and drainage should also be considered, as well as carbon fluxes related to management practices such as fire management, particularly if those practices have changed within the relevant period (for instance, when historically burning ecosystems are subject to fire suppression or where fire-protected ecosystems become fire-susceptible ecosystems) (Alvarado et al., 2020; Forkel et al., 2017; Kelley et al., 2019). Where possible, FLUC should be separated into the component fluxes corresponding to the different processes and adding up to the net regional FLUC. Typical components of FLUC, as reported by bookkeeping models, include immediate biomass losses during deforestation, delayed emissions from soil carbon and litter decomposition for all subsequent years following land use change (legacy emissions), emissions from wood products harvested as a result of deforestation or derived from secondary forests, and recovery gains due to secondary forest regrowth or afforestation (Hansis et al., 2015; Houghton et al., 2012). Previous versions of the Houghton et al.Â (2012) bookkeeping model (up until 2017) reported emissions from shifting cultivation as part of FLUC, but this term has been dropped in the most recent version of this model (Houghton and Nassikas, 2017). Houghton and NassikasÂ (2017) also provide emissions from forest degradation (i.e., biomass-reducing activities that do not result in the land parcel being reclassified as a non-forest) and subsequent recovery as part of FLUC.\n\nThe various methods available to quantify FLUC (TableÂ 2) rely on different input datasets and models with different abilities to represent land use practices. They further use different terminology and assumptions of which component fluxes to include, leading to inconsistencies between one another. For RECCAP2, the best data available in each region should be used. However, it is crucial to clearly define the methods and assumptions made and which FLUC fluxes are included in the corresponding results. If possible, regional FLUC fluxes estimated by the âbest methodâ should be compared with those estimated by the global datasets from the most up-to-date Global Carbon Budget coordinated by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) Global Carbon Budget in order to ensure consistency and comparability between regions. The methods used to estimate FLUC include: (i) bookkeeping models (BKs), (ii) dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), (iii) remote-sensing based methods, and (iv) national inventories, as detailed below.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\n5.1âBookkeeping models\n\nBookkeeping models rely on present-day vegetation and soil C densities (aggregated or spatially explicit) and different response curves (i.e., time courses of change) to estimate changes in C stocks following a given transition. FLUC in bookkeeping models includes respiration fluxes from crop and wood harvest slash and from legacy fluxes due to land use change. Based on the underlying forcing data, these can be separated by cause (e.g., management, deforestation, land abandonment, shifting cultivation). The two BK models used in the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) (Friedlingstein et al., 2019) are those from Houghton and NassikasÂ (2017) and Hansis et al.Â (2015), referred to as H&N and BLUE respectively. Both BK models are able to provide FLUC at country level but differ in a number of characteristics, such as the input data, the C densities and response curves used, the spatial resolution, and period covered, as summarized in TableÂ 2. Spatially explicit BK models such as BLUE can be adapted to run at regional scales with finer spatial resolution of land use change, derived from either national inventories or from remote-sensing (RS)-based transitions (e.g., ESA-CCI land cover). If very good data on C densities and ideally response curves is available regionally and no superior regionally BK model is available, BLUE can also be adapted to run with that information at country or regional level. One term that is not considered by bookkeeping models is the indirect effect of climate and environmental variability and change on sinks and sources (including respiration fluxes) resulting from land use change (LUC) (Obermeier et al., 2021; Yue et al., 2018). This effect is, however, implicitly included in stock-change-based estimates used in national inventories and in the most commonly used method to estimate FLUC by dynamic global vegetation models. Below, we discuss how to reconcile these different estimates.\n\n5.2âDynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs)\n\nDGVMs explicitly simulate the processes controlling photosynthesis, growth, decomposition, and mortality of vegetation and the processes involved in biomass and soil C changes. They also simulate the fluxes resulting from forest clearing, pasture and crop conversion, abandonment and regrowth, and crop harvest, although the implementation varies between models, as do the assumptions about the areas being converted (e.g., gross vs. net conversion; see Sect.Â 4.5), the management practices included, and the fate of C following transitions. DGVMs in RECCAP2 can be used to estimate FLUC in two ways: (i) the global simulations from TRENDY for GCB2019 can be analyzed at country or region level, and (ii) any DGVM including the aforementioned processes can be forced with better or finer data at country or regional level. If a DGVM with an improved representation of regional processes is available, it is recommended to use it rather than more generic global models. However, it is important for regional models to follow the simulation protocols of TRENDY (Friedlingstein et al., 2019) to facilitate comparison between regions. In order to estimate FLUC with DGVMs, factorial simulations with and without LUC from the preindustrial period until present are generally used. The year 1700âCE should be used as the reference data for the preindustrial state in RECCAP2 in order to be consistent with the TRENDY protocol in depicting legacy fluxes.\n\nThere are different ways to estimate FLUC, which partly explains differences between DGVMs and BK models. The DGVM simulations used to evaluate FLUC under different assumptions are listed in TableÂ 3. Up to now, FLUC from DGVMs have been estimated from the difference between two simulations, one forced with changing CO2, climate, and LUC and another forced with changing CO2 and climate but a fixed preindustrial land cover map (corresponding to S2âS3; see Table and the TRENDY protocol https://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/trendy/protocol/, last access: 8Â FebruaryÂ 2022âââââââ). The potential natural vegetation in the simulation with fixed land cover (S2) is affected by CO2 fertilization and therefore provides an additional sink that is lost, e.g., when deforestation occurs. This foregone sink is loss of additional sink capacity (LASC) (Gasser et al., 2020; Pongratz et al., 2014). For consistency with BK models, FLUC estimates with no LASC and based on present-day C densities should be delivered instead based on differences between two simulations under time-invariant present-day environmental conditions of climate, CO2, NÂ deposition, and NÂ fertilization: one with LUC (S5 in the TRENDY protocol and Fig.Â 3) and one with fixed preindustrial (1700âCE) land cover (S6 in the TRENDY protocol). In that case, FLUC can be estimated as follows:\n\n(1) F LUC S5 = S 5 - S 6 .\n\nBecause FLUC from both S5 and BK models are forced with present-day C densities, which have on average increased during the perturbation of the carbon cycle since preindustrial times, they may overestimate LUC emission fluxes in the first part of the last century. Therefore, an additional simulation (S4) can be performed where models are forced with time-invariant preindustrial environmental conditions and annual time-varying land use 1700â2018âCE. In that case the following equation can be used:\n\n(2) F LUC S4 = S 4 - S 0 ,\n\nwhere S0 is a control simulation with time-invariant preindustrial (1700âCE) CO2, climate, and land use. In this case, FLUC is calculated based on preindustrial potential C densities and does not include LASC. For consistency, the natural land sink over areas not affected by LUC can then be estimated with DGVMs as follows:\n\n(3) S LAND = S 3 - S 0 + S 6 - S 5 = S 3 - S 4 .\n\nAn additional feature of the simulations proposed here (FLUC S5 and FLUC S6) is that since FLUC are calculated as the difference of two simulations with fixed CO2 and climate, FLUC does not include effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on fire regimes, which should reduce the risk of double-counting of emissions. For RECCAP2, we recommend that FLUC from DGVMs is estimated following Eq.Â (1) (FLUC S5) so that results can best be compared with BK results in the recent decades.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nDownload\n\n5.3âRemote-sensing data related to LUC\n\nSeveral global remote-sensing products can be useful in estimating FLUC in RECCAP2. They can be applied in various ways. The first is by estimating land cover change in the recent decades to produce regional transition maps at finer spatial scales and with better accuracy than is currently available. These maps can then be used to force BK or DGVMs. The second is by providing finer-resolution and globally consistent maps of vegetation C densities (for undisturbed locations) that can be used in BK models. The third is by directly estimating changes in biomass C stocks, for instance using optical data (Harris et al., 2012) vegetation optical depth (Fan et al., 2019), or lidar data, and report these values for deforestation areas only (to exclude environmentally induced fluxes).\n\nExamples of already available remote-sensing-based datasets than can be used for land cover and land cover change mapping are the ESA-CCI land cover product, based on five different satellite missions at 300âm spatial resolution and annual time steps between 1992 and 2018 (ESA, 2017), and the Landsat 30âm spatial-resolution forest cover change product, covering 2000 to 2018 (Hansen et al., 2013) and extended to land cover change for forest, short vegetation, and bare soil (Song et al., 2018). For vegetation C densities, the ESA GlobBiomass dataset provides aboveground biomass data for a period centered on the year 2010 at 100âm spatial resolution (Santoro, 2018). Because of its fine spatial resolution, this dataset could, in principle, be used to evaluate undisturbed C densities (Erb et al., 2018; Luyssaert et al., 2012). Other datasets currently under development include the ESA-CCI high-resolution land-cover product, expected to provide a long-term record since the 1990s of regional high-resolution land cover maps at 30âm spatial resolution every 5Â years in regions of interest, and the ESA-CCI biomass dataset, which will provide aboveground biomass data for four epochs, i.e., the mid-1990s, 2007â2010, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019, at 100âm spatial resolution with a relative error of less than 20â%. The NASA Carbon Monitoring System program is also supporting the development of regional- to global-scale biomass products based on optical reflectance data from MODIS (as well as active lidar-based approaches using ICESAT-1 and now ICESAT-2 GLAS-retrievals) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Instrument or GEDI aboard the International Space Station. The lidar approaches require integration with wall-to-wall optical measurements as lidar is a âshotâ retrieval with a fairly small footprint size but has high accuracy in terms of measurement ability when retrieving canopy height and thus biomass (Dubayah et al., 2020). Satellite-based products have important advantages for estimating contemporary direct emissions from changes in aboveground biomass, such as global coverage, consistency, reliability, and increasingly higher spatial resolution. However, they cannot estimate legacy soil fluxes from land use change prior to the satellite era, and they are also unable to separate the contribution of environmental changes to FLUC. The comparison of FLUC derived from RS-based methods with DGVMs or BK estimates should therefore be made with care.\n\n5.4âNational inventories\n\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories (NGHGIs) report anthropogenic emissions and sinks to the UNFCCC and are the official numbers used to take stock of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs). NGHGI use different definitions and assumptions than those used by the carbon cycle research community, as detailed in Grassi et al.Â (2018). NGHGI, in their agriculture forestry and land use (AFOLU) sector, report CO2 fluxes of managed land, as defined by each country. Such managed land can include areas under nature conservation management. The C balance of established cropland, grassland, and forests are reported by national inventories under the LULUCF sub-sectors. The C fluxes of land use change transitions involving managed lands are reported separately based on national data on the area of different land use types. The carbon fluxes associated with transitions older than 20Â years old are ignored. A variety of approaches are used by NGHGIs, mostly based on general emission factors following IPCC guidelines. Only lands converted within the past 20Â years are included under LULUCF fluxes, unlike BK and DGVMs that calculate land use change fluxes since 1700 or 1850âCE. On the other hand, NGHGIs include land use change fluxes for transitions that are usually not implemented in BK and DGVMs, such as from peatland converted to agriculture and from land converted to human settlements.\n\n5.5âLand use change transitions, definitions, and assumptions\n\nThe land use change transitions and land management fields used in the latest version of the GCP Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al., 2019) to calculate the net land use change flux, called FLUC latest, are from the harmonized land use change data (LUH2v2.1h) dataset (Hurtt et al., 2011), which is based on HYDE3.1 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2011). These data have the advantage of being globally consistent and covering a long period (850âCEâpresent) but have relatively coarse spatial resolution (0.25âÃâ0.25â), and due to a globally consistent methodology they may not account for regional specificities (Bastos et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). For each region, the best available information (in terms of spatiotemporal resolution or detail of processes covered) on land use change should be used. This can be from national statistics, inventories, or remote sensing. In RECCAP2, each regional team will decide the land cover classification scheme that best fits a given region, but it is recommended that the LUH2v2h forest and non-forest distinction be used when classifying rangelands.\n\nAlvarado, S.
