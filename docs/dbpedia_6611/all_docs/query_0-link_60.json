        "text": "Plum Island and its Bird Life\n\nBy Ludlow Griscom\n\nMassachusetts Audubon Society, 1955\n\nIn 1606 Plum Island was discovered by Champlain. It was first mapped by Captain John Smith in 1616. Just before 1694 the whole adjacent coast was carefully chartered [sic] by Captain Cyprian Southack, who first showed how boats could best get by the dangerous bars to both Ipswich and Newburyport.\n\nIn 1621 the Plymouth Colony granted somewhat vaguely to Captain John Mason some land now known as Ipswich, and in 1639 Ipswich formally laid claim to Plum Island by allowing certain citizens to keep hogs on it. But troubles were soon to arise. In 1635 the Reverend Thomas Parker, with twenty-two friends, left Ipswich, sailed up the Plum Island River, turned left, and went up the now Parker River as far as they could get and founded Newbury. In the meantime economic conditions of the times made the salt-marsh thatch and hay exceedingly lucrative, and contests arose as to who owned the Plum Island River and Plum Island itself. Newbury was divided to make Rowley (1639), Newburyport was settled in 1645, and the whole matter was taken to the General Court in 1649, when Newbury asked for the entire island, largely on the grounds of economic necessity. The Court granted the southern two fifths to Ipswich, one fifth in the middle to Rowley, and the northern two fifths to Newbury. In 1664 Ipswich, on a strictly monetary basis, granted Plum Island to numerous people in double or single shares, whereupon various people began buying each other out. The soil was fertile for planting and fine oak and pine trees (six inches through) grew on the island. As fencing was impossible, the practice of keeping hogs, horses, and cattle on the unfenced area all winter ruined the grass on the marshes, and the General Court passed an act (1739) declaring this practice illegal, and the act was extended until at least 1785.\n\nIt must be recalled that old maps show that the south end of Plum Island was square. It ended in Bar Island Head with a fresh-water pond, the site of a dam and salt works (1829) with several buildings and six windmills. John Pengry built a house on the Bluffs in 1732 and actually ran a farm in these bleak and dreary surroundings. The next high land was Stage Island, where, in 1781, Enoch Dole build the “Willow Cottage” by a great tree, and a map exists showing nine houses on Stage Island, where stages for drying fish actually existed. There was a dike across the salt marsh to the main island, and a landing wharf for boats. Grape Island, just north and covered with trees, soon became thickly settled with many houses. North of Stage Island there was a great embayment of the river, now filled with salt marshes, by which “Stage Creek” now connects with “Pine Creek” running back to the mainland and back of Grape Island.\n\nNorth of Stage Island was Middle Island, another glacial drumlin, later known as the Cross Farm (Hill), which also was covered with trees, an apple orchard, and hayfields, and there the Least Flycatcher and Bobolink nested, and there was a colony of Cliff Swallows on the barn. Somewhere further north was the Wakefield Farm, and anyone poking about the dune hollows can find an old cellar hole or an aged apple tree showing signs of past settlement. On my first trip down the island in 1930, the Cross Farm house and barn still stood, the Dole House on Stage Island still survived and was occupied, the dike across had broken down, and remains of the Pengry House and the old sundial could be found on The Bluffs. The Emerson Rocks, or Reefs, were just north of The Bluffs, “Knobb’s Beach” stretched north to the Coast Guard Station built in 1890, and Bar Island had become a long sandy point stretching south and all vestiges of houses, dam and windmill, trees and apple orchards had disappeared.\n\nIt must be remembered that a load of salt-marsh hay and thatch (2500 pounds) was worth many hundred dollars, that people paid up to one hundred dollars per annum for the privilege of cutting hay, and that foresighted citizens operated huge shallow scows known as gundalows, in which the mown hay, stacked on staddles, was collected, loaded, and ferried to such landing points as Nelson’s Island and Pine Creek Landing. There teams distributed the hay to the neighboring areas, and inns and taverns were available for refreshment and rest during the times when storms or rain suspended the hay gathering or mowing operations. When economic change destroyed this industry, the people concerned abandoned their property, ceased to pay taxes, and the land was taken over by the towns on a tax title or unpaid lien bases.\n\nIt must also be remembered that in ancient times the fishing was excellent. Salmon, sturgeon, and shad ran up the Ipswich, Parker, and Merrimac Rivers up to 1817, oyster beds existed, and lobsters could be caught at the south end of the Plum Island River. Market gunning became highly profitable, and many of the houses now on Plum Island were hunting and fishing camps on which rents were paid to those grantors owning the mowing rights. Such a place is “Hale’s Cove,” formerly with a landing pier, just north of the present refuge warden’s house built by Charles Safford when he became warden for the Annie H. Brown Sanctuary of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. People like J. W. Goodridge and R. H. Wilkinson, of the Essex County Ornithological Club, had shooting camps on the beach above The Bluffs. Later a lawless gunning element made trouble on the sanctuary, and the Audubon directors had to hire Clifford Brocklebank as deputy warden during the hunting season. He lived in the remodeled Dole House and repaired the footbridge from Stage Island to the mainland.\n\nWe must now jump north to Newburyport, always a prosperous seaport town, incorporated in 1764 as a secession from the farming community of Newbury because all kinds of industry and commerce had developed. The adjusted boundaries allowed Newburyport to own the northern end of Plum Island, the line running across Woodbridge Island from where Rolf’s Lane comes in. The mouth of the Merrimac River was twice as wide between 1694 and 1800 as it now is. What is now known as the “Basin” did not exist in 1764 but did in 1805, when the harbor began to deteriorate rapidly because of silting and storms. The first breakwater built from the Basin across Woodbridge Island and out westward in 1831 was an engineering failure, and The Jetties were constructed in 1881. The Plum Island turnpike was built in 1807, but in 1809 a storm carried the bridge away, marooning a hotel built in 1807. A horse-dawn trolley line was built in 1887, and this was electrified from 1894 to 1905. The lighthouse dates back to 1860, the Coast Guard to 1881. Plum Island was noted for over one hundred wrecks and disasters involving considerable loss of life. Emerson’s Reefs was a veritable deathtrap, and bodies were buried at the base of The Bluffs or the dunes on Knobb’s Beach, the skeletons occasionally reappearing with another storm.\n\nIt must also be remembered that from 1930 to the hurricane of 1938, a long spit of sand ran out into the Merrimac River just north of the Coast Guard boathouse at the north end of the Plum Island road. This spit had two ponds at its base. It was a famous roosting area for gulls, terns, and shore birds at high tide, and very good studies of them could be obtained by creeping up through the dunes. Gilbert Emilio and I went there regularly, and there I collected the Little Gull, jumped a Connecticut Warbler, and sighted many a Short-eared Owl and Ipswich Sparrow.\n\nOrnithological history begins at Newburyport, where there had long been an excellent game market, whence Samuel Cabot obtained some Canvas-backs in 1846, the first specimens of record from the State. In some way or another Dr. Thomas M. Brewer managed to keep an eye on this market after 1873, and many rare birds labeled “Newburyport,” notably a Ruff in full breeding plumage, were obtained. I suspect, but cannot prove it, that Charles L. Perkins and Edward W. Eaton acted as agents for museums and local collectors. They were both veteran market gunners, and later, as the game birds declined, they were correspondents of E. H. Forbush. As exact labeling became required, it turned out that many of these birds were obtained on the Plum Island River, and William Brewster secured specimens of rarities. Two Eskimo Curlew were obtained at Newburyport by Colonel John E. Thayer in 1908, the last specimens for Essex County, but, alas, we do not know exactly where. In the meantime John R. Floyd, a veteran market gunner of Rowley, supplied Forbush with some interesting information. One of the early members of the Essex County Ornithological Club was J. W. Goodridge, a taxidermist at South Hamilton who maintained a gunning stand in Rowley and a camp on Plum Island, the only man I know who went to sea in a boat off the south end of Plum Island both spring and fall and recorded some notes of great interest. R. H. Wilkinson, of the Essex County Ornithological Club, also had a gunning camp on Plum Island. Gil Emilio and I often visited him there, securing items of interest. Shooting shore birds was his great hobby, and it is rumored that even after 1930, when the hunting of shore birds was prohibited, he, like many others of his time, saw no good reason why he should stop.\n\nIt thus happens that by pure chance of accessibility birding began at the south end of Plum Island, as there was a regular boat and livery service from Ipswich to Plum Island, the S. S. Carlotta I. The motor age had not yet arrived and visitors reaching Plum Island from Newburyport had no way of getting down the island except on foot. In spite of the trolley line and turnpike to Plum Island, James L. Peters told me that the time between Sunday trains was too short to make the trip worth while. But it was entirely possible to go to Ipswich, cycle to the landing, take the boat across to Stage Island, walk across the dike to the mainland, explore the farm trees and orchards, catch the last train back to Boston, and have a lovely and profitable trip. Peters, while still an undergraduate at Harvard, founded the Norfolk Bird Club in 1905, and he, Barron Brainerd, W. Charlesworth Levey, R. M. Marble, and others were constantly going to Plum Island between April 19 and late November, but rarely in winter. He started and edited a journal known as The Wren, Vol. I, Nos. 1-9, October 1908 - September 1909, now one of the very rarest of American bird periodicals, containing lists of birds seen. It was from him that I first learned that the thickets occasionally swarmed with land bird migrants in late May and October, and that is what started me going there.\n\nWe must now turn to the figure of Charles J. Maynard, a veteran but highly controversial figure in New England ornithology, who lived in Ipswich, collecting from 1868 to 1875, and who rowed himself across to Plum Island at least as early as 1872. Because his original business of taxidermy and professional collecting was halted by protection and the decline of interest, and because his private publishing enterprises never made any money, he cashed in, shrewdly enough, on the rising popular interest in birds and started a series of bird walks for a fee in 1893. These walks were a tremendous success, and many people now well-known birders in New England and members of the Nuttall and other clubs owe their original training and inspiration to Mr. Maynard. While people have told me that the Brookline Bird Club was an outgrowth of Maynard’s nature walks, this is denied by the surviving senior members. However, it must be admitted that the B. B. C. walks were after almost the exact pattern of Maynard’s walks, and many of the early members were his pupils. His walks included traditional trips to the south end of Plum Island on May 30 or October 12.\n\nHappily, Maynard had to start another publication, Walks and Talks with Nature, Vols. I-XII (1908-1920), a weekly issue containing lists of the birds seen on each walk, very often the number of people present, and the names of those better known. In this way we now have a record of what these people found and saw. They were frequently accompanied by J. L. Peters, Barron Brainerd, Judge Jenny, Dr. Mackie, R. C. Robbins, T. Emerson Proctor, C. E. Clarke, John B. May, Charles B. Floyd, Mrs. Lidian E. Bridge, Miss Annie W. Cobb, and Miss Anna K. Barry. Bitter rivalry broke out among some of these bird watchers, according to my old friend C. E. Clarke, who reminisced recently with me on events of half a century ago. Mr. Peters told me he stopped going when protection sentiment arose so strongly that he could no longer collect. Maynard, with his usual eccentricity, would depart from his original plan for his publication, print the syllabus of his summary bird course at Massachusetts Agricultural College, insert a long article on peculiar New England tombstones, describe new shells from the Bahama Islands, or use bird cuts from his earlier works that had nothing to do with the birds seen on the walk! Complete sets of Walks and Talks are extremely rare.\n\nI find that Maynard’s groups made sixty-nine trips in twelve years; struck a great wave on May 28, 1918, recording fifty-four species; and that they made several mid-June trips, thus determining the summer residents. Very often care must be taken in analyzing data, as the party would split, some preferring a shorter walk around Clarke’s Pond, Ipswich, or, if time permitted, they would go to both Ipswich and Plum Island in one day. In 1910, Maynard’s sixty-fifth birthday was celebrated by the presentation to him of a Zeiss binocular, over 200 people contributing, including his old fiend William Brewster.\n\nMr. Poor, on the S.S. Carlotta II, usually took the party over to Plum Island and landed them on the wharf on Stage Island. They would then walk past the farm, the rows of willows and poplars, across the dike to The Bluffs, explore Emerson Rocks at low tide, and move on up Knobb’s Beach to the Coast Guard Station, rarely on to Hell Cat Swamp (where they discovered the enormous Night Heron rookery on May 29, 1909), and home via the Cross Farm trees and apple orchards and pasture. It must be recalled that gulls, terns, all ducks, and shore birds were rare, for protection was just beginning to result in an increase. Thus terns were not recorded in numbers until the fall of 1917; shore birds were not seen in clouds until May 30, 1919. In the autumn the country swarmed with gunners, and many birds were shot or found dead. Mr. Maynard, who preserved his sight and hearing marvelously for a man of his age, began to retire after he reached seventy-five and dropped the walks project on his eightieth birthday.\n\nFrom 1930 on, the Massachusetts Audubon Society was acquiring the land which was added to the Annie H. Brown Sanctuary on Plum Island established by the Federation of Bird Clubs of New England and turned over to the Society in 1936. Warden Charles H. Safford, an old market gunner, built his house on Hale’s Cove and began patrolling the area on horseback in a very picturesque manner. He regularly sent reports on birds to the Audubon office, and they were reviewed by Francis H. Allen, who published a series of Plum Island notes in the Bulletin. Field trips to Newburyport and the north end of Plum Island began, but, so far as I know, the Sanctuary was rarely visited and no separate list of birds was kept.\n\nI first visited Plum Island on August 8, 1929, with John C. Phillips and State Warden Edward Babson. I drove to the south end alone on September 14, 1930, and with Mrs. Griscom on January 18, 1931. This last was a most exciting trip, for when the abominable road was blocked with snow I ran out over the ice on the frozen salt marsh, and my wife wouldn’t go again for years! It was indeed hazardous, most birders would not attempt the trip, and we all often got stuck or marooned by the rising tide. After 1930 the warden and the Coast Guard could help one out, and a shovel and rolls of chicken wire were regular equipment. In 1935, with excitement over the finding of a Glossy Ibis, I recall taking thirteen people in my Ford down to Hell Cat at one time. I find from my notes that I have made over five hundred trips to Plum Island, my companions on these trips numbering well over two hundred different people, including almost every well-known and active birder in eastern Massachusetts and belonging to every possible club or society. I recall with particular happiness a picnic supper trip with G. William Cotrell, Jr., in a cracking August heat wave. After evening birding and trying for owls, we finally reached Newburyport somewhat weary at 4:30 A.M., had coffee, and got home to an astounded maid just in time for a second breakfast at 9:00 A.M. It was a simple matter at that time to reach the Cross Farm Hill, but virtually impossible to make The Bluffs except in extreme drought or in a snowless winter. The results obtained by Maynard’s classes show that this region was a neglected opportunity, and many birds known mostly from the north end of the island will most certainly be found at the lower, or refuge, end sooner or later.\n\nTo sum up, Plum Island has been subject to several important ecological stresses, or changes: 1) The abandonment of the ancient farms has caused the loss of certain summer residents, such as the Least Flycatcher, Yellow-throated and Warbling Vireos, Bobolink, and Baltimore Oriole, and has greatly decreased several others. 2) There is no evidence that the plume trade drove out any nesting terns, but they all became exceedingly scarce. 3) Unrestricted market gunning, hunting, and collecting greatly reduced the waterfowl and all shore birds. 4) The intensive mowing and salt-marsh haying of the 250 years must have had a profoundly disturbing effect, although we can never positively know what it was. I note, however, that since it has stopped, the Long-billed Marsh Wren and Clapper Rail are rapidly occupying the creeks lined with tall thatch, and the Seaside Sparrow is another southern species that has come in, possibly because of milder winters. As everybody knows, shore birds tend to gather on salt marsh at high tide where the marshes are recently mowed, and I saw this mowing activity stop in my own time, not only on Plum Island itself, but also on the mainland in the area formerly known as “The Hundreds.” During the fall migration, a most sterile trip recently has been to Nelson’s Island. People cannot remember that it was formerly a most rewarding trip, when the marshes on both sides of the causeway were closely mown; here Golden Plover, Hudsonian Curlew, and Baird’s Sandpiper were routine. 5) The Annie H. Brown Sanctuary of the Massachusetts Audubon Society had little ornithological effect, barring better protection from hunters, as the Society at that time lacked the means for any modern plan of management or development. In those days birding in the thickets was indeed a handicap, as Hell Cat Swamp was virtually impenetrable, and a rare bird glimpsed there by an observer usually could not be found again or shown to the party. 6) When the Federal government took over the land to establish the present Parker River Wildlife Refuge, certain changes were promptly made. A greatly improved dirt road was built down to the Cross Farm drumlin, and this road went right through the middle of Hell Cat Swamp, destroying the last enormous Night Heron rookery in the State. It has made the woods and thickets far more available for the study of land bird migrants than was formerly possible. The construction of a long dike for the First and Second Impoundments was at first a great disappointment, as, to everyone’s surprise, they failed to hold their fresh-water supply through a period of drought. This stopped with the First Impoundment by 1952, and now no one can predict what will happen next. Large flocks of ducks, herons, and shore birds now gather there at appropriate seasons, and some which were formerly casual on salt marshes have begun to nest. Blue and Snow Geese have become regular transients, and many remarkable records are being made by an increasing horde of visitors. It is certain that this refuge will not prove to be an ornithological racket, as its numerous enemies and opponents, with a lamentable and almost tragic lack of vision, have so strongly insisted. In the meantime “birders” are encouraged by a sympathetic refuge staff, provided they behave tactfully and considerately, especially during the breeding and hunting season.\n\nBut, ornithologically, at the moment the most spectacular feature of Plum Island is the occasional wave of land bird migrants which at times every year deluge the woods and thickets to a degree almost unbelievable to the uninitiated. As I have personally experienced thirty-one of these waves, some account is in order:\n\nMarch. Only twice. March 27, 1932, and March 27, 1949. Requiring a cold and backward season suddenly warming up with a strong southwest wind blowing all the night preceding the “wave.”\n\nApril. Very rare. Requiring exactly the conditions similar to late March. April 16, 1933, the first warm night after a cold and backward month, is an example. Almost every one can remember the more recent spectacular deluge of birds on April 26, 1953.\n\nMay and June. People must recall that the proximity of cold salt water greatly retards the season on Plum Island and little happens until the plum bushes are in full bloom, May 15-20. Earlier it is a routine experience to visit the southern edge of Essex County, Nahant or Marblehead Neck, and find that a great “wave” has arrived overnight, of which no traces can be found on Plum Island. Only three times have I ever found a good flight of land birds before May 16. Later on, from May 20 to early June, the situation is exactly reversed, results at Nahant and Marblehead Neck giving no inkling of the swarm of birds awaiting the visitor to Plum Island. My latest date for such a flight is June 6, 1952. On May 25, 1947, I find I kept a complete Plum Island list, recording eighty-six species in half a day.\n\nAugust. With the first indications of fall, the situation becomes exactly reversed. The condition required is a cold front with northwest winds — comparatively scarce in August. August 25, 1948, August 29, 1951, and August 19, 1952, are dates when the right conditions prevailed.\n\nSeptember. Same conditions as August, usually of annual occurrence, best in the middle of the month. Maximum, eighty-two species on September 16, 1948. I find I have personally never encountered a good wave in late September, after the 21st, but is it certain to occur.\n\nOctober. While the variety of species is decreased, it is primarily the month of sparrows, and late stragglers of the September group. Fifty-five species on October 2, 1949, is the best I have ever done, and later than this I have no personal experiences, but Peters’s group and Maynard’s group did very well indeed up to October 15 on many occasions.\n\nIn more recent years many people have expressed the wish to spend the whole day on Plum Island, leaving out most parts of the traditional Essex County route. James Baird, James Moran, Robert Smart, and Wallace Bailey have indeed tried it with success, but others have frequently selected the wrong day and obtained little or nothing worthy of record. Nevertheless, the old motto “Nothing venture, nothing have” is an ornithological truism on Plum Island, and all records given here may be superseded by those who try it and hit it right.\n\nWarm thanks are hereby extended to Judge Robert Walcott, G. W. Cottrell, Jr., and Dr. John B. May for reminiscences, recollections, and historical references. The members of the Old Colony Bird Club have devoted several meetings to furthering this paper with notes, records, and helpful suggestions. All members are seasoned veterans of Plum Island excursions. In addition, Charles E. Clarke, of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, got in touch with the widow of George L. Perry, who kindly donated her husband’s records, arranged in systematic order, beginning with visits to the south end of Plum island as far back as 1921. Miss Eleanor Barry also kindly reviewed her long Plum Island experiences, from 1921 to 1954. Mr. Clarke also put me in touch with Miss Annie W. Brown, now ninety years old, who began going to Plum Island with C. J. Maynard in 1908.\n\nAt the express request of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the list of birds is submitted in two parts: 1) The Parker River Refuge only, from the north boundary gates to the southern end of the island, including all the salt-marsh areas west of Plum Island River and east of the Turnpike or Route 1; and 2) A supplemental list of additional species and records of rarities seen at the north end of the island, to which most visitors now regularly go. As examples of differences in these areas, we might cite the Old-squaw, common in proper season in Newburyport Harbor but less in evidence at sea as seen from the dunes of the refuge; the Upland Plover, found occasionally at the upper end of the island, not reported from the refuge, yet nesting in the Newburyport region and found regularly in summer on the Newburyport common pasture; and the Woodcock, rarely if at all seen on Plum Island, yet a regular migrant and breeding bird in the upland area of Newbury known as The Downfall.\n\nIn view of the abundant literature available to all on the migration dates of birds of eastern Massachusetts, and of Essex County in particular, dates given here are confined to rarities and others notably early or late. Where no name appears after a special date or record, “Griscom and party” is to be understood. The symbol (#) appearing after a name indicates “and party.” The total Plum Island list now stands at 320 species and subspecies. It will readily be seen that the number of possible or probable species unreported up to this time is exceedingly small, thus making this one of the most remarkable local lists ever made in the Northeastern States.\n\nList of Birds from Refuge Boundary to South End of Plum Island (including whole salt-marsh area on the Refuge).\n\nCommon Loon.
