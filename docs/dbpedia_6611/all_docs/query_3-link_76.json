        "text": "Neuronal heterogeneity has been characterized and classified in brains by gene expression, morphology, and connectivity. The increasing number of molecularly defined neuron types revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) accentuates the need for integrated methods to relate gene expression, cell morphology, and axon projection patterns. Several imaging-based and sequencing-based methods have been developed to allow for spatial gene expression profiling in both thin (~10 µm) and thick (≥100 µm) tissue (Chen et al., 2015; Codeluppi et al., 2018; Moffitt et al., 2018; Nicovich et al., 2019; Qian et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018), including expansion-assisted iterative fluorescence in situ hybridization (EASI-FISH) (Wang et al., 2021). These methods provide spatially resolved molecular composition of neuronal types, but they can also serve as a bridge to link cell types classified using scRNA-seq with functional attributes, such as neuronal projections (Zhang et al., 2021) and activity (Bugeon et al., 2022; Lovett-Barron et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Some methods, such as BARseq2 (Chen et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2021) and MERFISH (Zhang et al., 2021), have been developed for mapping neuronal projections in the cortex, but most of these methods have been performed in thin tissue sections, limiting 3D tissue context.\n\nThe central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) (Cassell et al., 1999; Cassell and Gray, 1989; Keifer et al., 2015; Moscarello and Penzo, 2022) integrates external and internal sensory information to control motivated behaviors and learning in appetitive (Cai et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2013; Hardaway et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2014) and aversive domains (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Haubensak et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2019). The CEA also controls a variety of innate responses such as autonomic functions (Iwata et al., 1987; Kapp et al., 1979), taste valence (Sadacca et al., 2012), food and water intake (Douglass et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017), jaw movements (Han et al., 2017), as well as predatory behavior (Han et al., 2017). The CEA is also involved in responses to general anesthetics (Hua et al., 2020), addiction (Domi et al., 2021; Torruella-Suárez et al., 2020; Venniro et al., 2020), pain (Allen et al., 2021; Allen et al., 2023; Han et al., 2005; Okutsu et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2019), and itch (Samineni et al., 2021).\n\nCEA neurons elicit these distinct behavioral functions based on their axon projection patterns. For example, the CEA influences multiple processes associated with threat responses, such as freezing and cardiovascular adaptations, via projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) (Tovote et al., 2016) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) (Saha, 2005). CEA→vPAG projections are also involved in chloroquine-induced pruritic behaviors (Samineni et al., 2021). Neurons in the anterior CEA are implicated in predatory hunting responses in rodents via projections to the parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt) and the vlPAG (Han et al., 2017). CEA projections to other hindbrain regions (Veening et al., 1984), such as the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), modulate food intake (Douglass et al., 2017), alcohol consumption (Bloodgood et al., 2021; Torruella-Suárez et al., 2020), and pain responses and aversion (Allen et al., 2021; Allen et al., 2023; Han et al., 2005; Han et al., 2015; Okutsu et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2019). In addition, the CEA→lateral SN (lateral substantia nigra) pathway promotes learned behavioral responses to salient stimuli (Lee et al., 2005; Steinberg et al., 2020).\n\nThe CEA consists of primarily GABAergic neurons that are organized within at least three subdivisions. In the classical view (Duvarci et al., 2011), the lateral central amygdala (CeL) is a primary target for external and internal sensory inputs that are processed and passed to the medial central amygdala (CeM), a major output nucleus projecting to hindbrain autonomic and motor control areas. For instance, activation of CeM elicits freezing behavior (Ciocchi et al., 2010), which is gated by disinhibition of a local inhibitory projection from CeL to CeM (Haubensak et al., 2010). However, long-range projections from the CeL have been reported (Cassell et al., 1999; Herry and Johansen, 2014; Li and Sheets, 2018; Veening et al., 1984; Ye and Veinante, 2019), indicating direct influence of this subregion on downstream areas. In addition, the capsular central nucleus (CeC), a subdivision at the far lateral edge of the middle and posterior CEA and the anterior lateral portion of CEA, receives distinct axonal inputs (Cassell et al., 1999) and contributes to controlling defensive behaviors (Kim et al., 2017) and appetite (Carter et al., 2013). In addition to distinct projection patterns, neurons in different CEA subnuclei also showed distinct electrophysiological properties and morphology (Li et al., 2022; Li and Sheets, 2018; Mork et al., 2022), with additional functional heterogeneity observed along the rostrocaudal topographic axis (Bowen et al., 2022).\n\nThe CEA also contains multiple molecularly defined neuron populations that have been investigated for their role in appetitive and defensive behaviors. Previously used marker genes for CEA cell types include protein kinase C delta (Prkcd), somatostatin (Sst), corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), tachykinin-2 (Tac2), or neurotensin (Nts). Prkcd is expressed in a set of CEA neurons that reduce freezing, promote extinction learning, suppress appetite when activated (Cai et al., 2014; Haubensak et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2017), and elicit defensive behaviors when inhibited (Ciocchi et al., 2010). CEA Prkcd neurons are also associated with drug craving (Venniro et al., 2020) and alcohol addiction (Domi et al., 2021). Sst, Crh, and Tac2 neurons have been associated with the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear responses such as freezing or flight (Andero et al., 2016; Andero et al., 2014; Gafford and Ressler, 2015; Li et al., 2013; Sanford et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2016). In addition, Nts-expressing neurons are involved in feeding and reward-related behaviors (Kim et al., 2017; Torruella-Suárez et al., 2020). Additional work has demonstrated that some of these markers (Sst, Crh, Nts) have a considerable degree of overlap in the same neurons, whereas others are distinct (e.g., Prkcd) (McCullough et al., 2018b). However, the molecular diversity of CEA neurons has been incompletely examined. In addition, it has been difficult to establish the correspondence of CEA axonal projections with its many molecularly defined cell types. Therefore, the functional significance of CEA subpopulations defined by both anatomical and molecular characteristics remains largely uncharacterized."
