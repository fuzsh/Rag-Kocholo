Particularly intriguing are the discussion and artistic representations of the feminization of Guanyin, the impact of material culture, and the self-mutilation practices of virtuous women that include them flesh cutting and plucking out their own hair to use to embroider an image of the deity—all depicted with elegance, clarity, and an appreciation for the complexities of belief and practice.\n\nRecent EALC College graduate Samuel Baureis has been accepted into the highly competitive 2019-2020 Yenching Scholars program at Peking University: \"While at the Yenching Academy at Peking University, I plan to continue my study of the philosophical significance of relationships in the Confucian context, specifically friendship, and the consequences such relationships have on ethical and political structures within a comparative philosophical framework. I have chosen to focus on friendship in particular because, out of the five primary relationships in Confucian philosophy, it has received the least attention in contemporary scholarly work. I believe that a philosophical look at the importance of friendship provides a productive jumping-off point for a larger comparative dialogue between Western and Confucian philosophies. In engaging in this topic, I hope to expand the sphere of cross-cultural knowledge held between Eastern and Western countries and enable effective and meaningful dialogue on pressing political and international issues.\"\n\nFirst-year College student Lucy Li won Second Place in the 2019 Midwest University Speech Contest.\n\nAlumnus George Sipos will start an exciting new job in March 2019.
