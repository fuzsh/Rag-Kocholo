My name is Sabine Maria Peters. A deep interest in communications and psychology has been with me throughout my professional activities. Solid business training and my exciting years as an event manager led to self-employment as a communications coach in 1996.

Through my work with very diverse people I was able to further my knowledge about the effect and impact of human dialogue and explore what makes communications successful in practice. This led to ideas and concepts that enable companies to optimize initial contact from prospective customers, clients and partners.

My excellent record and high appointment rates for my clients led to an ever-growing customer base via word of mouth as well as requests for more training programs.

Therefore, from my practice and longstanding success I created a special training concept, which enables people to build customer loyalty and to communicate with humor, confidence and authenticity.
