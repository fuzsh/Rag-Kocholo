AFC said on its homepage: "Referee Gulmurodi Sadullo from Tajikistan will control an official match in the Asian Cup for the first time. Congratulations on a historic milestone."

Referee Gulmurodi Sadullo's assistants include Mr. Tsapenko Andrey and Tantashev Ilgi from Uzbekistan, the referee is Mr. Ronnie Koh Min Kiat from Singapore, and in charge of the VAR room is Thai referee Sivakorn Pu Udom.

Referee Gulmurodi Sadullo is 33 years old and has been a FIFA referee since 2017. This is the first time this "black king" has refereed a match at the Asian Cup.

However, at the club level, the Tajik referee has officiated many matches in the AFC Champions League, notably the match between Hanoi FC and Urawa Red Diamonds (Japan) on December 6, 12 on the field. My Dinh campaign, within the framework of the AFC Champions League 2023/2023 group stage.

In this match, the representative of Vietnam created an earthquake by defeating the defending champion of the tournament. Notably, in the 85th minute, referee Gulmurodi Sadullo, after consulting VAR, gave Hanoi a penalty kick. Tuan Hai successfully scored an 11m kick to help Hanoi FC win 2-1.

With referee Gulmurodi Sadullo becoming the referee for the Vietnam match against Indonesia, Tuan Hai and his teammates personally felt very comfortable.

Hopefully, after the luck brought to Hanoi FC, the Tajik referee will continue to help coach Philippe Troussier and his team have a good result in the 2023 Asian Cup.

The match between Vietnam and Indonesia takes place at 21:30 p.m. on January 19 at Khalifa Stadium (Doha, Qatar). This is a key match for both Southeast Asian football representatives.
