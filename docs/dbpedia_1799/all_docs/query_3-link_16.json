        "text": "Forgive my ignorance -- is \"attacking phase of play\" precisely defined anywhere? I can't find a great source on Google, and also not clear if this is a LOTG issue or an ROC issue.\n\nMy judgement of this play is that the defense never really gains control of the ball, though they do deliberately play it a couple times. And I don't think you could plainly say the attacking team maintains possession between the offside and the goal, though they certainly do maintain pressure.\n\nBut I'm just not sure what objective criteria exists to evaluate this. Or is it even objective?\n\nI don’t think it is defined anywhere (publicly) either. I agree that some objective criteria would be nice. There will always be some element of subjectivity to it, but it could be reduced.\n\nI think it’s fair to say this is some really bad communication from Shaun Evan’s following a review that led to the awarding of a very late Saudi Arabia goal yesterday. Everyone was confused what he was giving.\n\nThere was also a potential SFP challenge in the 14’ of LBN-CHN that might be worth looking at, as well as violent conduct given after on-field review in the TJK-QAT game.\n\nTwo other situations from this game:\n\n17’ Qatar’s goal comes from a turnover that happened because the referee blocked off a Tajikistan player. I think you can make a good enough case for a a foul by the Qatari player in that whole mix-up as well.\n\n31’ potential penalty kick for a swinging arm to the face by a Tajik defender, very long check and review (4 minutes or so), but I think they came to the right decision in the end. The attacker is clearly impeding the defender (before the slap) to open up a run by the player on the left wing, correctly given as a free kick coming out with a yellow card to the defender.\n\nThe appointment on Vietnam vs Indonesia tomorrow really catches my eye:\n\nREF: Sadullo Gulmurodi (TJK)\n\nAR1: Andrey Tsapenko (UZB)\n\nAR2: Timur Gaynullin (UZB)\n\nFO: Ilgiz Tantashev (UZB)\n\nRAR: Ronnie Koh Min Kiat (SGP)\n\nVAR: Sivakorn Pu-udom (THA)\n\nAVAR: Fu Ming (CHN)\n\nPart of the reason this is interesting is because, in Indonesia's previous game, against Iraq, the appointment was as follows. I've bolded names which are repeated in one capacity or another:\n\nREF: Ilgiz Tantashev (UZB)\n\nAR1: Andrey Tsapenko (UZB)\n\nAR2: Timur Gaynullin (UZB)\n\nFO: Sadullo Gulmurodi (TJK)\n\nRAR: Rawut Nakarit (THA)\n\nVAR: Salman Falahi (QAT)\n\nAVAR: Sivakorn Pu-udom (THA)\n\nYou'll recall that the big moment of controversy in that match was Iraq's winning goal, which was preceded by a clear offside offense. However, the offside was ruled to be outside of the APP and not eligible for review. Indonesia was obviously incensed by that error. So with all that in mind, it's certainly notable that the AVAR from that match sticks around as VAR, the AR who missed the call has their very next game, and the referee has to stand next to the manager all game as fourth!\n\nBut also it's interesting because Sadullo Gulmurodi only came to the tournament listed as a Standby Referee and, from all I can tell, is one of the least experienced guys there.\n\nNot sure what AFC is trying to say with this appointment but it feels like they're trying to say something; at a minimum, that they don't care about the controversy it could generate.\n\nAnd the need for several looks at the monitor. And the weird mechanics to change it to red. Definitely shows a referee who is not comfortable with VAR on top of one who is seemingly not comfortable identifying SFP.\n\nI can sorta see how he misses it live—the foot starts lower, and he could have been deceived into thinking the contact was much lower than it was. But since he already saw the force live, I don’t know why he would need anything more than the one shot showing point of contact to know it was red. (Perhaps, if he isn’t used to having a VAR it was stalling for time as he was thinking through what he had to do next?)\n\nOddly enough (and undermining my initial assessment) he is Japanese and the J-League has VAR, so lack of familiarity can't be an excuse here.\n\nI'm all for piling on referees for missing plays like this, but we have to recalibrate our expectations in this modern world with VAR especially at international tournaments.\n\nThe reality is almost every referee is gonna go yellow at this stage of the match in almost any match of consequence\n\nYou really think Michael Oliver or Anthony Taylor are giving this in real time on a Man City vs. Liverpool/Arsenal title decider? They wouldn't want to \"negatively affect the match by overreacting.\"\n\nYou think Elfath or Ramos are giving this to an Argentine or Brazilian player 10 minutes into a group stage match at the Copa America this summer?\n\nWe've gone through two World Cups with essentially no red cards given in real time for SFP or VC and yet we are demanding a Japanese referee get this right at the Asian Cup?\n\nValid argument. When you scope out and view the big picture, I see what you mean. But why are referees afraid to give it when it's like this? By having VAR give the red, everyone says \"Ok, well it wasn't him\"\n\nYou don't want to risk giving a red for an \"orange card\" offense in the 9th minute that VAR has to check complete.\n\nAlso, we got +16 minutes in the second half of this game somehow. I'm actually surprised that the referee didn't play beyond the original 16 as well because he did wind up booking a Tajik player for delaying the restart during the additional time."
