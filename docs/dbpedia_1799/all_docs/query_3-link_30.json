        "text": "After six games without a goal, the All Whites finally broke their drought to register a 2-1 win against China at Wellington’s Sky Stadium.\n\nIn the second of their international series, New Zealand won thanks to an own goal and another from substitute Matthew Garbett.\n\nMain photo: Matthew Garbett is surrounded by teammates after scoring his goal.\n\nBut New Zealand did it the hard way, missing a first-half penalty and conceding a goal in stoppage time to put a few nerves on edge.\n\nWith the absences of senior players Chris Wood (injured) and Tommy Smith (suspended), interim head coach Darren Bazeley picked a side with Alex Greive to lead the attack and Michael Boxall in the centre of the backline.\n\nREAD MORE: Chris Wood to fly back to England after ruled out of second game against China >>>>\n\nBazeley opted for a 4-2-3-1 formation with Marco Rojas in the 10 role, and given freedom to roam.\n\nJoe Bell (23) was named captain of the full international side for the first time.\n\nBell provided the first half-chance of the game when he slid the ball into the path of Greive but goalkeeper Junling Yan spread himself to block the ball.\n\nShihao Wei got China’s first shot on target when he hit a rising shot from outside the area, forcing goalkeeper Oli Sail to play safe and tip it over the bar.\n\nSail kept the home side in the game with a good save in the 19th minute when Lei ran through and blasted a shot goalwards.\n\nMidway through the half, New Zealand were dominating possession — the live stats showed they had two-thirds of the ball at that stage — but China were demonstrating they were comfortable without the ball, and were prepared to rely on fast counterattacks.\n\nCompared to Thursday’s tame effort at Mt Smart Stadium, the All Whites were willing to shoot from anywhere.\n\nLibby Cacace shot hard and low from outside the area, to see his effort blocked.\n\nMarko Stamenic whacked a thunderous 22-metre shot along the ground, for ‘keeper Junling Yan to smother.\n\nBoxall hit one from 30 metres that swerved high and wide of the goal.\n\nStamenic headed wide from 10 metres when Elijah Just swung a cross into the box.\n\nSurely, a goal was coming, to end the All Whites six-game drought in front of goal.\n\nJust darted into the box and was brought down in the 33rd minute. Referee Kim Woo Sung pointed to the spot.\n\nGreive, the only All White playing in Wellington for the first time, took responsibility and lined up the penalty.\n\nHe struck it tamely, and the ‘keeper pulled the ball into his chest.\n\nThe collective anxiety was obvious among the New Zealanders.\n\nTen minutes later, they broke through, scoring their first goal in 583 minutes of international football, the first since March 30, 2022.\n\nThe scorer? Chenjie Zhu, a 22-year-old centre back who headed a Rojas free kick into his own net, under pressure from Boxall.\n\nThe All Whites’ relief and joy was obvious in the goal celebration, despite having no goalscorer to mob.\n\nHalf-time: New Zealand 1, China 0.\n\nHalf-time stats (New Zealand / China)\n\nPossession: 63% / 37%\n\nTime in opposition half: 56% / 44%\n\nShots: 11 / 2\n\nShots on target: 2 / 2\n\nCrosses: 7 / 4\n\nSaves: 2 / 2\n\nPasses: 333 / 183\n\nPass accuracy: 85% / 76%\n\nFouls: 4 / 9\n\nCorners: 5 / 2\n\nThe second half produced half-chances for both sides as China worked their subs bench and looked to go forward.\n\nIn the 64th minute, substitute Max Mata was tackled in the box as he was about to shoot.\n\nAs the game entered its last quarter, the All Whites focussed on holding possession but still looking to get forward.\n\nIn the 80th minute, New Zealand made sure of the win when Bell stroked an inch-perfect pass through the China backline for substitute Matthew Garbett to take on his chest, control the ball and slot it into the net.\n\nGarbett celebrated in front of the White Noise; he was quickly surrounded by teammates.\n\nWhen the commotion died, Kyle Adams came off the bench to make his full international debut.\n\nAnd for the last segment of the game, the All Whites — and the crowd — had the luxury of being able to enjoy the moment, as they ran down the clock to victory.\n\nSail and Adams were needed to block a late China goal attempt. It was a reminder the job had not been completed.\n\nThe warning was not heeded.\n\nTwo minutes into stoppage time, Bell lost possession in midfield, and the China players went forward en masse.\n\nThe cross came in and substitute Dun Ba firmly planted his header into the New Zealand net.\n\nA minute or so later, the final whistle went.\n\nThe All Whites and their supporters could enjoy a long-awaited home victory.\n\nFull game stats (New Zealand / China)\n\nShots: 17 / 10\n\nShots on target: 4 / 7\n\nPossession: 60% / 40%\n\nPasses: 620 / 412\n\nPass accuracy: 83% / 75%\n\nFouls: 8 / 14\n\nCorners: 6 / 5\n\nResult\n\nGame played on Sunday March 26, 2023\n\nNew Zealand 2 (own goal 42′, Matthew Garbett 81′)\n\nChina 1 (Dun Ba 90+2′)\n\nLine-ups\n\nNew Zealand\n\nOli Sail, Tim Payne (Callan Elliot 75′), Michael Boxall, Nando Pijnaker (Kyle Adams 82′), Liberato Cacace, Joe Bell (c), Marko Stamenic, Marco Rojas (Clayton Lewis 64′), Alex Greive (Max Mata 64′), Callum McCowatt (Kosta Barbarouses 82′), Elijah Just (Matthew Garbett 75′).\n\nSubs: Alex Paulsen, Stefan Marinovich, Cam Howieson, Dane Ingham, Alex Rufer, Deklan Wynne.\n\nChina\n\nJunling Yan, Linpeng, Chenjie, Wu Shaocong (Wei Zhen 46′), Yang, Wu Xi (c) (Xie Pengfei 82′), Xu Xin (He Chao 66′), Dang Hanwen (Sun Guowen 54′), Lei, Wei Shihao (Lin Liangming 46′), Chen Pu (Dun Ba 46′).\n\nSubs: Dianzuo, Shangyuan, Shuai, Binbin, Ang, Jiaqi.\n\nOfficials\n\nReferee: Kim Woo Sung.\n\nAssistants: Folio Moeahi, Bernard Mutukera.\n\nFourth official: Sivakorn Pu-Udom.\n\nMatch highlights\n\nWatch nine minutes of edited highlights here:\n\nPrevious game\n\nGame played on Thursday March 23, 2023\n\nMt Smart Stadium, Auckland\n\nAttendance: 12,049\n\nNew Zealand 0\n\nChina 0\n\nREAD MORE: Skipper Tommy Smith sent off as All Whites hang on for scoreless draw with China >>>>\n\nMore football stories"
