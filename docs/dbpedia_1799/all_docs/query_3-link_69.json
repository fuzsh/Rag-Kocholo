        "text": "Quang Hai surpassed Thai star Chanathip Songkrasin to take the top honour for the first time. The Hanoi FC player played an indispensable role as Vietnam won the 2018 AFF Cup trophy, made the last four at the 2018 Asian Games and qualified for the 2019 Asian Cup quarterfinals.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Quang Hai sends deep thanks to coach Park Hang-seo, Vietnamese teammates and especially the home fans for their support.\n\nIn the “AFF Coach of the Year (Men)” category, it came as little surprise as Park Hang-seo beat Malaysia coach Tan Cheng Hoe to claim the honour. The Republic of Korea tactician helped Vietnam to quench their long-lasting thirst for the AFF Cup trophy and advanced to the Asian Cup semifinals for the first time in history. Since taking charge of the Vietnamese team in late 2017, Park has never been defeated while confronting the Southeast Asian opponents.\n\nTran Quoc Tuan, permanent vice president of the VFF and president of the AFC's competition committee, presents the award to Vietnam head coach Park Hang-seo.\n\nVietnam’s joy was multiplied as the Golden Dragons were named the AFF National Team of the Year (Men) following their triumphant 2018 AFF Cup journey as well as their amazing 2019 Asian Cup run. In addition, Tran Van Vu became the first Vietnamese futsal player to be honoured at the AFF Awards with the AFF Futsal Player of the Year title.\n\nCaptain Que Ngoc Hai represents the Vietnamese squad to receive the \"AFF National Team of the Year (Men)\" award.\n\nConcerning the AFF’s best XI, Vietnam had three representatives, namely Nguyen Quang Hai (midfielder), Dang Van Lam (goalkeeper) and Que Ngoc Hai (defender), while the remainders included Syahmi bin Safari (Malaysia), Safuwan Baharudin (Singapore), Korrakot Wiriyaudomsiri (Thailand), Sanrawat Detchmir (Thailand), Syamer Kutty Abba (Malaysia), Riko Simanjuntak (Indonesia), Stephan Schrock (Philippines) and Talaha (Malaysia).\n\nThailand dominated the awards categories for women, with Pitsamai Sornsai being named the AFF Player of the Year and Nuengrutai Srathongvian winning the AFF Coach of the Year award. Besides, the Thailand women’s team were honoured as the AFF National Team of the Year.\n\nSyahmi Safari (Malaysia) was named for the “AFF Best Goal in the AFF Suzuki Cup 2018” award with his strike against Thailand in the second leg of the semifinal which ended up in a 2-2 draw and sent Malaysia into the final match thanks to the away goals rule."
