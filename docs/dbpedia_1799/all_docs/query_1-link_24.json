        "text": "Italian uniforms celebrate World Cup Final referees Gonella, Collina, Rizzoli\n\nThe Italian referee uniforms adopted new colours: the traditional black and fluorescent yellow are flanked by 'coral red' and, for the first time in the history of the AIA, 'intense green'. Colors that, in addition to being a clear reference to the national flag, symbolize passion, strong personality and the desire to overcome adversity, but also perseverance, harmony and hope for the future. A chromatic range, therefore, that wants to highlight a strong reference to the country's feeling of unity and resilience, put to the test by a particularly delicate historical period linked to the Covid emergency.\n\nThe unmistakable Legea style, the innovations introduced respecting the tradition of the Federation and the AIA, find a clear and evident synthesis in the layout of the new uniforms. The body of the sweaters, in all its chromatic shades, on the front and on the back, is strongly characterized by a plot of perpendicular lines that intersect creating a series of angles facing downwards, with different thicknesses to create a psychedelic effect. The nuance makes the shirt particularly dynamic, symbolizing the stubbornness and will of those who never give up. Along the sides there are bands that reproduce the Legea sail, the company's historic logo. The front pockets in the \"hidden pocket\" structure, equipped with velcro stripes to facilitate opening during the match, are highlighted by the monochrome border at the top. Between them, in a central position, is the high definition logo of the FIGC - Italian Referees Association; on the right pocket, three stylized gold and black whistles celebrate the Italian referees who directed World Cup finals: Sergio Gonella (1978), Pierluigi Collina (2002) and Nicola Rizzoli (2014). The innovative graphic and stylistic aspects are combined with a high technicality of the product. The jerseys were made in Tree - Tech - Legea, an ultralight fabric with breathable micro-mesh inserts placed in the key areas of the shoulders and along the hips up to the underarm area. This technological solution, combined with the particular elasticity of the fabric and the slim - fit cut, favors perspiration and the evaporation of sweat towards the outside, thus ensuring extraordinary comfort and full freedom of movement. The competition uniforms are completed by black shorts and socks, which recall the colors of the jerseys.\n\n\"The prestige of the Italian refereeing is recognized nationally and internationally\", comments the President of the AIA, Marcello Nicchi. \"In the last four years, between the Champions League, the Europa League and the UUEFA Super Cup, the Italian refereeing team has been entrusted with three finals in 11v11 football, in addition to the important achievements in Futsal and Beach Soccer. A sign that our refereeing school is at the top of the world and our winning image. The new collection of match uniforms, which Legea has prepared for us - he concludes - pays us homage and will accompany us throughout the season \". “New look, same quality. This is the prerogative of Italian referees - says the President of the FIGC, Gabriele Gravina - appreciated all over the world: knowing how to renew themselves, adapting to new rules and new styles of refereeing, while remaining faithful to an extraordinary school characterized by extremely high performance on the pitch. The new Legea kits celebrate the start of a new season, which we hope will soon be a great party for everyone, with the referees always protagonists\".\n\nSource: AIA\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nAFC Champions League 2020 – Group Stage (Matchday 6)\n\n23-24 September 2020\n\nEsteghlal FC – Al Ahli SFC\n\nReferee: Adham Makhadmeh (JOR, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ahmed Al-Roalle (JOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Mohammad Al-Kalaf (JOR)\n\nFourth Official: Ahmed Al-Ali (JOR)\n\nAl Hilal – Shabab Al Ahli\n\nReferee: Ahmed Al Kaf (OMA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Abu Al Amri (OMA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Rashid Al Ghaithi (OMA)\n\nFourth Official: Yaqoob Abdul Baqi (OMA)\n\nShahr Khodro – Pakhtakor\n\nReferee: Hanna Hattab (SYR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ali Ahmad (IRQ)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Ronnie Min Kiat (SIN)\n\nFourth Official: Masoud Tufayelieh (SYR)\n\n↧\n\nAFC Champions League 2020 – Group Stage (Matchday 6)\n\n23-24 September 2020\n\nEsteghlal FC – Al Ahli SFC\n\nReferee: Adham Makhadmeh (JOR, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ahmed Al-Roalle (JOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Mohammad Al-Kalaf (JOR)\n\nFourth Official: Ahmed Al-Ali (JOR)\n\nAl Hilal – Shabab Al Ahli\n\nReferee: Ahmed Al Kaf (OMA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Abu Al Amri (OMA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Rashid Al Ghaithi (OMA)\n\nFourth Official: Yaqoob Abdul Baqi (OMA)\n\nShahr Khodro – Pakhtakor\n\nReferee: Hanna Hattab (SYR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ali Ahmad (IRQ)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Ronnie Min Kiat (SIN)\n\nFourth Official: Masoud Tufayelieh (SYR)\n\nAl Duhail – Al Taawoun\n\nReferee: Mohd Yaacob (MAS)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Mohd Muhamad (MAS)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Abdul Hasim (SIN)\n\nFourth Official: Muhammad Bin Jahari (SIN)\n\nPersepolis – Sharjah\n\nReferee: Ilgiz Tantashev (UZB)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Andrei Tsapenko (UZB)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Timur Gaynulin (UZB)\n\nFourth Official: Sherzod Kasimov (UZB)\n\nSepahan – Al Sadd\n\nReferee: Sivakorn Pu-udom (THA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Nakarit Rawut (THA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Tanate Chuchuen (THA)\n\nFourth Official: Hettikankanamge Perera (SRI)\n\nAl Nassr – Al Ain\n\nReferee: Hussein Abo Yehia (LIB)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Mohamed Salman (BHR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Abdulla Al-Rowaimi (BHR)\n\nFourth Official: Nawaf Shukralla (BHR)\n\n↧\n\nSpanish referees have to wait to be considered as “professional athletes”\n\nRecently, CTA-RFEF made an important announcement for the future of the First and Second Division referees and assistants regarding the change of their status as professional athletes in their contracts. On 25 March 2020, the RFEF Delegate Committee gave the green light to this change in the General Regulations relating to the refereeing body. The most important and key aspect lies in their change of name, becoming considered as \"professional referee, assistant referee and video assistant referee\", also disappearing the age limit for retirement that until last season was set in the Regulations of the RFEF at 45 years. It is exactly the terminology \"professional\" that will have to wait for now.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Consejo Superior de Deportes (CSD) released an unfavorable report regarding the modification of article 167 of the RFEF Regulation, included within those modifications approved by the aforementioned Delegate Committee of the RFEF. In section 1, the referees are attributed the status of professional athlete, a consideration that the report considers \"It is not justified, since it is not included in the Royal Decree 1006 that regulates the employment relationship of professional athletes, nor is this situation recognized by jurisprudence\". This negative report ended up being imposed and for the moment denying this condition to the refereeing body. Accepting it would mean modifying the aforementioned Royal Decree 1006 and allowing both the football refereeing establishment and the rest of sports to benefit from this condition. Something that should be like that, but legally has enormous complexity. Hence, at the moment the referee and assistant of First and Second Divisions are to be considered as \"professionalized\", not “professional”. This small setback, which Luis Rubiales himself recognized in his recent re-election as president and said that they will continue to fight because the referees are professionals, does not affect their recent job change because on 1 September 2020 all referees, assistants and referees signed their first contract, which is 14 pages long and ties them with the RFEF for one season. Specifically from this first day of September until 30 June 2021. Furthermore, this new employment regulation scenario implies that professional football refereeing becomes dependent on the Social Security regime. This season, this contract also gives them the possibility of being able to combine their refereeing activities with other work, but from next season it will mean an exclusive dedication. In the cases where it will not be possible, the referee must waive 10% of the amount received from the refereeing body. The employer will fully pays all the amounts that the refereeing body is entitled to receive as a result of the signing of the professional refereeing agreement by Javier Tebas and Luis Rubiales in August 2018, exceeding 16 million euros in terms of salaries of the referees, assistants and VARs. Then there are other items in terms of travel, courses, etc. In addition, and under this new labour regime, it is also the Professional League itself that assumes the expenses of Social Security, which amounts to 2 million euros.\n\nSource: Sport\n\n↧\n\nUEFA Europa League 2020/2021 – Play-offs\n\n1 October 2020\n\nArarat Armenia – Crvena Zvezda\n\nReferee: Anastasios Sidiropoulos (GRE, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Polychronis Kostaras (GRE)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Lazaros Dimitriadis (GRE)\n\nFourth Official: Ioannis Papadopoulos (GRE)\n\nReferee Observer: Ichko Lozev (BUL)\n\nCFR Cluj – KuPS Kuopio\n\nReferee: Ivan Bebek (CRO)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Goran Pataki (CRO)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Bojan Zobenica (CRO)\n\nFourth Official: Mario Zebec (CRO)\n\nReferee Observer: Miroslav Tulinger (CZE)\n\nGNK Dinamo – Flora Tallinn\n\nReferee: Ali Palabiyik (TUR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Serkan Olguncan (TUR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Cem Satman (TUR)\n\nFourth Official: Arda Kardeşler (TUR)\n\nReferee Observer: Martin Ingvarsson (SWE)\n\nSlovan Liberec – Apoel FC\n\nReferee: Andreas Ekberg (SWE)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Mehmet Culum /(SWE)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Stefan Hallberg (SWE)\n\nFourth Official: Kristoffer Karlsson (SWE)\n\nReferee Observer: Haim Jakov (ISR)\n\nMalmö FF – Granada CF\n\nReferee: Istvan Kovacs (ROU)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Vasile Marinescu (ROU)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Mihai Artene (ROU)\n\nFourth Official: Marius Avram (ROU)\n\nReferee Observer: Tomasz Mikulski (POL)\n\nCharleroi SC – Lech Poznan\n\nReferee: Felix Zwayer (GER)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Thorsten Schiffner (GER)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Marco Achmüller (GER)\n\nFourth Official: Bejmain Cortus (GER)\n\nReferee Observer: Jouni Hyytiä (FIN)\n\nRosenborg BK – PSV Eindhoven\n\nReferee: Davide Massa (ITA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Alberto Tegoni (ITA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Stefano Alassio (ITA)\n\nFourth Official: Fabio Maresca (ITA)\n\nReferee Observer: Uno Tutk (EST)\n\nHapoel Beer Sheva – Viktoria Plzen\n\nReferee: Srdjan Jovanović (SRB)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Uroš Stojković (SRB)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Milan Mihajlović (SRB)\n\nFourth Official: Novak Simović (SRB)\n\nReferee Observer: Alexandru Deaconu (ROU)\n\nLegia Warszawa – Qarabag FK\n\nReferee: Tobias Stieler (GER)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Christian Gittelmann (GER)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Rafael Foltyn (GER)\n\nFourth Official: Daniel Schlager (GER)\n\nReferee Observer: Emil Bozhinovski (MKD)\n\nFK Sarajevo – Celtic FC\n\nReferee: Benoît Bastien (FRA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Hicham Zakrani (FRA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Frederic Haquette (FRA)\n\nFourth Official: Benoît Millot (FRA)\n\nReferee Observer: Volodymyr Petrov (UKR)\n\nDynamo Brest – PFC Ludogorets\n\nReferee: Slavko Vinčić (SVN)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Andraž Kovacić (SVN)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Grega Kordež (SVN)\n\nFourth Official: Nejć Kajtazović (SVN)\n\nReferee Observer: Costas Kapitanis (CYP)\n\nStandard de Liege -

The 40-year old has been on a 20-year journey of refereeing, becoming the first ever woman to officiate a men’s top flight game in Ethiopia. She was also the first ever woman FIFA referee in the East African nation.\n\n“I started off in Jimma, while still playing basketball. I played football in school, but basketball was my first sport. I was interested when I met one of the instructors doing some courses and some of us from the basketball team were invited. I liked how he was teaching and I got interested more,” Tafesse says. The seed planted in her soul by the FIFA/CAF instructor Shiferaw Eshetu continued to germinate and grow as the days went on. When she moved to the capital Addis Ababa to continue her basketball career and pursue a course in Pharmacy, the interest continued and soon she started building on with more courses and when it became apparent that she had found some new love, dumped the old one; basketball. “I was part of the female referees’ project and I started off by doing the U-15, 17 games, the local tournaments as well as some Federation tournaments. I got more certification and I started doing the Men’s Premier League as an assistant referee and, in 2005, I became a centre referee,” narrates Tafesse. The journey, though satisfying hasn’t been easy for the mother of one. When she started, there were no women referees and when she officiated men’s games, there was even more difficulty. But her resilience and desire to make a mark in Ethiopian football drover her passion. “It was very difficult when I started because sometimes, some people would ask why I decided to go into refereeing as a woman when there were no any other women doing the same. But my family supported me and I am grateful for them. Also, I came from a sports background and the fact that while playing basketball we trained and played against some men teams gave me confidence and it wasn’t so difficult for me at times, even when I did men’s games,” explains Tafesse. She also remains grateful to the Ethiopian Football Federation who gave her and her colleagues confidence to continue and even handed them Premier League matches to boost their confidence. He vividly remembers the influence former vice-president Tihaye Egziaber had on her. “He would talk to us as women referees and really encouraged us. He gave us so much support,” she states.\n\nHer impressive performances earned her a first ever international assignment in 2006 when she officiated a U-20 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between Nigeria and Liberia in Abuja and that opened the floodgates for her to grow. “I will not forget that match because it was so different. The stadium was bigger than what we are used to here in Ethiopia, the crowd was amazing and the level was definitely good,” Tafesse remembers. She has gone on to progress, doing the All Africa Games in 2007 and 2011, before going on to do the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) four times in a row in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. On top of that, she has officiated at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2015 and 2019, did the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2016 as well as the U-20 in 2018. But in between all those wonderful assignments, she faced a challenge that nearly slowed down her sailing career. In 2013, she conceived her first born child who will be turning seven years old in October. But, the aftermath of her return seven months later was full of challenges. “Physiologically, as women, we have so many body changes after pregnancy and I was not different. I gained so much weight and I had to work very hard to get back in shape. I worked a lot and eventually I was better and in 2014, I got a chance to go for the Cup of Nations. But while training there, I got injured and in my mind, it was all over for me. I tried to do some tests and see whether I could go on but I had decided I would go home. However, the director came and told me ‘Lydia you are not going. Just try and see whether you can recover’. I started treating the sprain on my ankle every day and, ultimately, I got better. I did a match in the semi-final, Cameroon vs Côte d'Ivoire, which went up to extra time. Surprisingly, I was stronger and fitter than both teams when the game went to 120 minutes. I was so pleased,” Tafesse remembers. This is one of her most memorable matches. The other one was in 2012 when she officiated another semi-final pitting Nigeria and South Africa, a match that the Banyana Banyana won 1-0. “It was such a great game to officiate because both of them are brilliant teams. Also, it was very hot and I remembered hoping it would not go to extra time,” jokes Tafesse. She hopes to continue getting high profile games moving forward and is even more excited that she will get a chance to officiate at a CAF men’s tournament for the first time as she is among those picked for the African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Cameroon next year.\n\nDespite the stoppages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Tafesse has continued to train on her own and has also use the time off competitions to give back to the community. She is using her background as a pharmacist and knowledge in medicine to raise awareness on the virus and help the community keep themselves safe from contracting and spreading the virus. “I have been doing education on social media and on radio and TV stations just trying to tell people on the dangers of the virus. I also go to the communities and teach them how to wash hands and keep hygiene. Also, I have been giving back to the community by helping the vulnerable who have not had a chance to get food and basic commodities,” she states. On her training, Tafesse admits that it has been tough but notes she has not had a reason to put the feet off the gas. “I train outside three times a week and also indoors, where I have tried to put up my own small gym. We have a system where we have to make reports daily as well as GPS trackers to ensure we are training.” As a woman, Tafesse says it has been great balancing between her family and refereeing, a career she has given her full attention to. The support from her husband and the motivation of her seven-year old keeps her going, Tafesse says. And now, she hopes she can influence the next generation of women referees in Ethiopia and the continent at large to take up the career. She hopes that after her active years, apart from continuing with her profession as a pharmacist, she will switch to become an instructor as she looks to get more and more referees following her path.\n\nSource: CAF\n\n↧\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022 Qualifiers – CONMEBOL (Matchday 1)\n\n8 October 2020\n\nParaguay – Peru\n\nReferee: Nestor Pitana (ARG, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Martin Soppi (URU)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Carlos Barreiro (URU)\n\nFourth Official: Gustavo Tejera (URU)\n\nVAR: Daniel Fedorczuk (URU)\n\nAVAR: Andres Matonte (URU)\n\nArgentina – Ecuador\n\nReferee: Roberto Tobar (CHI)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Christian Schiemann (CHI)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Claudio Rios (CHI)\n\nFourth Official: Christian Ferreyra (URU)\n\nVAR: Cristian Garay (CHI)\n\nAVAR: Andres Cunha (URU)\n\nUruguay – Chile\n\nReferee: Eber Aquino (PAR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Eduardo Cardozo (PAR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Milciades Saldivar (PAR)\n\nFourth Official: Arnaldo Samaniego (PAR)\n\nVAR: Juan Benitez (PAR)\n\nAVAR: Jose Mendez (PAR)\n\nColombia – Venezuela\n\nReferee: Guillermo Guerrero (ECU)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Byron Romero (ECU)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Ricardo Baren (ECU)\n\nFourth Official: Augusto Aragon (ECU)\n\nVAR: Carlos Orbe (ECU)\n\nAVAR: Christian Lescano (ECU)\n\nBrazil – Bolivia\n\nReferee: Leodan Gonzalez (URU)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Nicolas Taran (URU)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Richard Trinidad (URU)\n\nFourth Official: Facundo Tello (ARG)\n\nVAR: Esteban Ostojich (URU)\n\nAVAR: Fernando Rapallini (ARG)\n\n↧\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022 Qualifiers – CONMEBOL (Matchday 2)\n\n13 October 2020\n\nPeru – Brazil\n\nReferee: Julio Bascunan (CHI, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Jose Retamal (CHI)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Raul Orellana (CHI)\n\nFourth Official: Ivo Mendez (BOL)\n\nVAR: Piero Maza (CHI)\n\nAVAR: Gery Vargas (BOL)\n\nChile – Colombia\n\nReferee: Dario Herrera (ARG)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Julio Fernandez (ARG)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Cristian Navarro (ARG)\n\nFourth Official: Fernando Echenique (ARG)\n\nVAR: Mauro Vigliano (ARG)\n\nAVAR: Fernando Espinoza (ARG)\n\nEcuador – Uruguay\n\nReferee: Wilmar Roldan (COL)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Wilmar Navarro (COL)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Miguel Roldan (COL)\n\nFourth Official: Bismarks Santiago (COL)\n\nVAR: John Ospina (COL)\n\nAVAR: Carlos Betancour (COL)\n\nBolivia – Argentina\n\nReferee: Diego Haro (PER)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Jonny Bossio (PER)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Victor Raez (PER)\n\nFourth Official: Michael Espinoza (PER)\n\nVAR: Victor Carrillo (PER)\n\nAVAR: Angelo Hermosilla (CHI)\n\nVenezuela – Paraguay\n\nReferee: Andres Rojas (COL)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Alexander Guzman (COL)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Dionisio Ruiz (COL)\n\nFourth Official: Carlos Herrera (COL)\n\nVAR: Nicolas Gallo (COL)\n\nAVAR: John Leon (COL)\n\n↧\n\nPenalty kick awarded via VAR after full-time whistle\n\nManchester United sealed a dramatic victory against Brighton on Saturday following one of the most incredible finales in Premier League history at the Amex Arena. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side looked to have squandered two points when Solly March deservedly drew the home side level deep in stoppage time when he headed home at the far post. United, however, responded by mounting one last attack and earned a corner thanks to a surging run from summer signing Donny van de Beek. Bruno Fernandes’ subsequent cross located Harry Maguire at the far post and he powered a header towards goal. The flight of the ball was altered by the flailing arm of Neal Maupay but the full-time whistle had blown before the danger had been cleared by March, standing on his own goal line.\n\nMaguire led United’s appeals and referee Chris Kavanagh was persuaded to visit the pitch side monitor, despite having already signalled the end of a dramatic contest. The official quickly spotted Maupay’s offence and allowed Fernandes the opportunity to win a thrilling contest which, according to former Premier League official Peter Walton, was the correct decision. He said: “The referee has got it right. I haven’t seen that before. In the laws of the game the only thing that the referee can extend the game for after the final whistle is the taking of the penalty kick. In this instance the incident took place before he blew the final whistle so the VAR was going through his process of checking to make sure there was nothing untoward. ‘Chris Kavanagh blew his final whistle, however the incident happened just before the final whistle and was allowed within law, and as I’ve said because the penalty was yet to be taken the referee within law has to allow time for the kick to be taken.”\n\nSource: Metro\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMatticoli: 300 Beach Soccer matches\n\nItalian referee Gionni Matticoli celebrated his 300th beach soccer match when he refereed the final of the recent Euro Winners Cup. Mattocoli refereed 190 international and 110 national matches in his career and this was his 12th final, a long list of achievements that began to in 2013 at the very first edition of the Euro Winners Cup held in San Benedetto del Tronto.\n\nThe Euro Winners Cup is a competition organized by Beach Soccer Worldwide and reserved for the winning clubs of their respective national championships and others of the best in Europe. The 7th edition was held this month in Nazaré, a Portuguese town which is now a consolidated venue for various beach soccer competitions, hosting 26 men's and 5 women's clubs from all over Europe. There were 18 referees appointed, including three Italians: Gionni Matticoli, Saverio Bottalico and Fiammetta Susanna. The refereeing team was led by another Italian, FIFA instructor Michele Conti, also a member of the National Committee of the Italian Referees Association. Bottalico, who in the days preceding the Tournament had directed the decisive match of the Euro Beach Soccer League between Portugal and Switzerland, was assigned the semi-final between the Spaniards of CD FP Marbella and the Russians of BSC Kristall, and then we was the third referee in the final, along with his compatriot Matticoli and German Torsten Gunther, played between the Russians of BSC Kristall and the Portuguese of SC Braga, currently holders of the title. Susanna led the referee team for the decisive match of the Euro Winners Cup Woman, made up of German colleague Annett Unterbeck and Hungarian Renata Foris. A \"non-final final\" as the five women's clubs that participated in the tournament faced each other in a single round and the match between the Russian WFC Zvezda and the Spanish CFP Caceres was decisive for assigning the women’s title.\n\nSource: AIA\n\n↧\n\nAFC Champions League 2020 – Round of 16 (West Region)\n\n26-27 September 2020\n\nAl Ahli SFC – Shabab Al Ahli\n\nReferee: Nawaf Shukralla (BHR, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Mohamed Salman (BHR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Abdulla Al-Rowaimi (BHR)\n\nFourth Official: Adham Makhadmeh (JOR)\n\nPakhtakor – Esteghlal\n\nReferee: Ahmed Al Kaf (OMA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Abu Al Amri (OMA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Rashid Al Ghaithi (OMA)\n\nFourth Official: Mohd Yaacob (MAS)\n\nPersepolis – Al Sadd\n\nReferee: Ko Hyung-Jin (KOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Yoon Kwang-Yeol (KOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Park Sang-Jun (KOR)\n\nFourth Official: Kim Dae-Yong (KOR)\n\nAl Nassr – Al Taawoun\n\nReferee: Ali Al-Qaysi (IRQ)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ahmed Al Roalle (JOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Mohammad Al Kalaf (JOR)\n\nFourth Official: Sivakorn Pu-Udom (THA)\n\n↧\n\nBrych refereed most UEFA Champions League matches\n\nIt is the very best teams, the champions, the best who, according to the anthem, compete against each other in the UEFA Champions League. DFB referee Dr. Felix Brych was able to hear the musical masterpiece more often than any other referee. In the DFB.de interview, the 45-year-old referee talks to editor Arthur Ril about his special record in the premier class competition, the eventful 2019/2020 season and the upcoming Bundesliga start.\n\nDFB.de: Mr. Brych, how would you describe last season in a few words?\n\nDr. Felix Brych: The 2019/2020 season was extraordinary and demanding - on and off the pitch. Due to the circumstances that we faced with the Corona break, but also personally. I had a lot of close games that were competitive until the very end. I had to evaluate a lot of tricky situations. I don't think I've ever given as many red cards as I did last season. It really demanded a lot from me, but it also brought something beautiful to light, for example my record in the Champions League.\n\nDFB.de: You have been a DFB referee since 1999, in the Bundesliga since 2004 and internationally since 2007. What new experiences did you have in the 2019/2020 season?\n\nBrych: Of course, the closed games were a new experience. That was something new for me too, which I had to adjust to. After the pre-season, which hadn't gone so well for me with the World Cup, I wanted to fight my way back completely. I had hoped that I would reach my performance limits again in 2019/2020. I did that in many games, and that's why I'm very satisfied with the 2019/2020 season from a sporting perspective.\n\nDFB.de: And what experience would you have liked to have done without in retrospect?\n\nBrych: Games in an empty stadium are different than in front of a sold out house. The atmosphere pushes me too, but it also motivated me that I had to prepare for an empty stadium because it was something new for me. I noticed that I was really looking forward to the first game after the Corona break. Another special feature was that the regional association neutrality was lifted, so that I was allowed to whistle in Bavaria. That released new strength somewhere and with it, in turn, new motivation in me. That's why I don't want to completely miss out on this experience, but of course I'm happy when the stands are full again at some point.\n\nDFB.de: Among the currently active DFB referees, you have by far the most matches in the Bundesliga with 283 appearances,. And in the UEFA Champions League you also rose to the record of most matches refereed, after the game between SSC Napoli and FC Barcelona. Have you always had this goal in mind?\n\nBrych: It was never my goal, but recently I had noticed that this record was possible - and then it became my goal. So this game in Naples was a really special game.\n\nDFB.de: In the history of the Champions League, with 57 appearances, you directed the most games of all referees. What does this record mean to you?\n\nBrych: A lot. Of course, it's not just this record game that is special, but rather the entire way there - and that I persevered for so long. Every now and then we each walk through a valley, sometimes things don't work the way we want, we have to face setbacks or defeats. But I've always been able to fight my way back and motivate - for every game, every year. Then when I saw the record in sight, I really started counting the games and in the end I am proud that it worked out.\n\nDFB.de: In the second leg of the match between Manchester City and Real Madrid, you even managed to increase your own record to 58 appearances in the premier class of European football. Do you still get goose bumps when you hear the Champions League anthem?\n\nBrych: The anthem is very special to me and I get goose bumps every time I hear it, but not just before the game. I'm so focused that I almost don't notice the surrounding area anymore. I did everything I could to be allowed to whistle in this league. Every Champions League appearance is still a highlight for me. That's why my goal is to be able to hear the anthem a few more times.\n\nDFB.de: In the UEFA Europa League you were appointed to lead the semi-final between FC Sevilla and Manchester United in Cologne. Whistling a European Cup game on German soil, this experience has only been granted to a few DFB referees so far. How was it for you to be able to referee an international game in Germany?\n\nBrych: I was really looking forward to this mission, although it can also be dangerous. If the anticipation is too great, you may lose your tension, but that didn't happen to me. To be able to whistle a European Cup game at home is an opportunity only given to very few referees.\n\nDFB.de: After the Corona-related restart of the Bundesliga, the DFB referees were also grateful and happy to be back on the pitch so that they could pursue their passion again. How do you feel about the upcoming Bundesliga start?\n\nBrych: With the same feeling as after the restart, with a certain joy and gratitude that we can return to the field. But certainly also with a question mark: How does it go next? How is the health situation developing nationally and internationally? The focus is clearly on the sport, but the view also goes around us.\n\nDFB.de: 36 appearances in national and international competitions. How do you actually recover from such an exhausting season? Were you able to enjoy the summer break and switch off? At the beginning of September the training camp of the DFB referees in Grassau and the preparation for the new season were already on the agenda.\n\nBrych: A correct and deeper recovery was not possible between the seasons, but we all had the 8-week Corona break, which I used accordingly - both mentally and physically. In the course of my career I have learned to switch off as quickly and intensively as possible in a very short time.

Asian refereeing set new benchmarks earlier this year when the AFC U23 Championship Thailand 2020 became the first AFC competition to successfully implement VAR across all 32 matches. Now Asia’s premier club tournament will become the third AFC competition to embrace the latest in technology from the Quarter-finals after it was first introduced from the same stage of the AFC Asian Cup UAE 2019. As part of the AFC’s commitment to ensure Asia’s match officials are equipped with the latest in VAR developments, numerous seminars and courses have been organized with the first-ever online AFC VAR course held as recent as last month, which engaged a total of 104 AFC Elite Match Officials from 19 Member Associations. Additionally, to further enhance the AFC’s VAR capabilities, a virtual AFC VAR Information Officer (VIO) Workshop 2020 was organized on August 26 to ensure VIOs are well-versed with the technical requirements of the VAR system. The VAR system, which aims to provide minimum interference with maximum benefits, is limited to four game-changing decisions or incidents, specifically - goal or no goal, penalty-kicks, direct red cards and mistaken identity decisions.

And many will rub their eyes - for the first time, Bibiana Steinhaus (41), a woman whistles this game. The police inspector from Hanover has been refereeing in men's professional football since 2007, and in the first division since 2017. Wednesday it will be a triple premiere, because she has not yet refereed a game with BVB participation. In addition: it will be her first appearance as main referee this season. No question about it - for Bibi it is the biggest game of her career! Even if she has already whistled 3 World Cups and 3 European championships - they were all women's tournaments. But this milestone will be her last big appearance. The popular referee is ending her career, the “Bild” reports. Steinhaus has been refereeing in the Bundesliga since 2017 (23 games), and since 2007 in the 2nd Bundesliga (92 games). Now, after the Super Cup it will be over for “Bibi”. The reasons for this decision? Her private life. For four years she has been with ex-referee Howard Webb (49), who currently lives in New York. Due to the Corona crisis, the two only saw each other on screens for five months. Only a few weeks ago they were finally able to embrace each other again in London. (Source: Express)\n\nBibiana Steinhaus ends her national and international referee career. The German Super Cup final between FC Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in Munich will be her last appearance in a stadium. The 41-year-old Steinhaus explains the reasons for her retirement: \"Like many people in the time of the Corona situation, I reflected and re-assessed some things. After a very trusting and constructive conversation with Lutz Michael Fröhlich, the director of the DFB Elite Referees and after carefully weighing up many factors, I decided to end my national and international career as a referee. For tonight, I wish that the focus would be on the game alone. I will explain the reasons for my retirement in due course in more detail\". (Source: DFB)\n\nFritz Keller (DFB President): “I very much regret Bibiana Steinhaus' early retirement. In the future, German football will not only have to continue without an outstanding referee, it will also lose an extraordinary personality and a pioneer in a male domain. I still hope very much that many more women referees will enrich our professional as well as amateur football. Bibiana Steinhaus will continue to be a role model.”\n\nHeike Ullrich (Deputy DFB General Secretary): \"Bibiana Steinhaus is not only a great person, but also an extraordinary top referee, who has made it into the Bundesliga and internationally in many finals. She opened doors worldwide for numerous other female referees who are today in male professional football. Well beyond 90 minutes, rather for years, she has convinced on and off the pitch with her competence and professionalism. I would like to thank her very much for these invaluable achievements and I hope that she will continue to do more than just that in the refereeing area, but remains connected to the entire football family.”\n\nRonny Zimmermann (DFB Vice President for Referees and Qualification): “Bibiana Steinhaus is the German referee par excellence. She has had an incomparable career worldwide and has proven to all critics that she has what it takes to referee in the Bundesliga. For millions of female athletes - players and referees - from the grassroots to the top - she has become a role model with her success story and special personality and will leave deep marks. I take my hat off to this sporting life's achievement.”\n\nLutz Michael Fröhlich (DFB Director of the Elite Referees): “Bibiana Steinhaus ends her career as a referee on the pitch with today's game. She deserves the greatest recognition for what she has achieved, the greatest respect for her decision and a big thank you from my side for the absolutely trusting cooperation. An absolute enrichment for football, both in terms of the way she conducts the games and in personal contact. She really earned the nomination for this important game. That is the focus for today and I keep my fingers crossed for her and her team for the game management.” (Source: DFB)\n\n↧\n\nEPL will lobby IFAB to change the handball laws\n\nThe Premier League will lobby the rule-making International Football Association Board to change the handball laws following the controversial penalty awarded against Tottenham’s Eric Dier last Sunday. Dier was adjudged to have handled illegally, even though his back was turned, when an Andy Carroll header struck his raised arm against Newcastle. The referee, Peter Bankes, awarded a penalty, which Newcastle scored to equalise in second-half added time. The rule that a player must be found to have handled the ball if their arm is raised above their shoulder – as was the case with Dier – will have to be followed until the end of the season but it is the Premier League’s hope that IFAB will review the law at that point.\n\nThe development comes as the referees’ body, Professional Game Match Officials Limited, plans to roll out an overhauled version of the handball law at Premier League matches this weekend. Changes will include allowing referees greater leniency in interpreting a player’s body shape during handball incidents. In the first three match days of the season, the PGMOL instructed referees to follow the letter of IFAB’s ruling that handball should be given if a player’s arm was in an “unnatural” position. That has been changed to acknowledge that, depending on a player’s momentum or body position, an “unnatural” shape could also be “expected”. Referees will be encouraged to award a free kick or penalty kick only if the shape is unexpected. Other tweaks to the rules include consideration of the time a player has had to respond before handling. If a referee judges that the distance was insufficient for a player to react and move out of the way, a penalty will not be given. The Premier League acknowledges that this is not only a change to the rules weeks after implementing them but a change in emphasis too. After FIFA took control over the use of VAR technology this summer, it placed emphasis on a consistency of decision making across different countries. These tweaks will add subjectivity to the process in England, with all the controversies and debates that will likely ensue.\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nAFC Champions League 2020 – Semi-final (West Region)\n\n3 October 2020\n\nAl Nassr – Persepolis\n\nReferee: Muhammad Bin Jahari (SIN)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Ronnie Min Kiat (SIN)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Abdul Hasim (SIN)\n\nFourth Official: Mohd Yaacob (MAS)\n\nReserve AR: Mohd Muhamad (MAS)\n\nVAR: Sivakorn Pu-Udom (THA)\n\n↧\n\nMessi caught clashing with referee in tunnel after Barcelona red card\n\nBarcelona captain Lionel Messi confronted referee Del Cerro Grande in the tunnel to protest Clement Lenglet's red card against Celta Vigo.\n\nThe French defender was shown a second yellow card three minutes before half-time during Thursday night's LaLiga fixture for putting an arm across Celta midfielder Denis Suarez.\n\nMessi argued with referee Carlos Del Cerro Grande on the field and, as tunnel cam TV footage from Movistar has revealed, didn't let the debate rest during half-time. Messi, Gerard Pique and manager Ronald Koeman all stood around Del Cerro Grande and demanded an explanation.\n\nThe official explains his decision and twice demonstrates the move Lenglet made with his arm. Koeman looks distinctly unimpressed with something Del Cerro Grande said and Pique was also determined to get his views across.\n\nEventually the group make their way back onto the field for the second half with the referee again reproducing Lenglet's raised arm for Messi.\n\nIn the end, Barcelona's numerical disadvantage counted for little. Already ahead thanks to Ansu Fati's 11th-minute strike, they went 2-0 up thanks to a Lucas Olaza own goal and completed a 3-0 win thanks to Sergi Roberto late on. \"You can debate whether it was a yellow or not,' said Koeman afterwards. 'It was a tough punishment. It's difficult being a referee. It's a decision we don't have to discuss. It was more important to talk about how to play with a man down than to discuss that. I'm very proud of this team in today's match. We worked very well and played with a lot of discipline in the team, with one man down.\" Barcelona have won both their opening LaLiga matches and host Sevilla in their next fixture on Sunday evening.\n\nSource: Daily Mail\n\n↧\n\nUEFA U-21 Euro 2021 Qualifying (Matchday 11)\n\n7-9 October 2020\n\nLithuania – Greece\n\nReferee: Kateryna Monzul (UKR, photo)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Oleksandra Ardasheva (UKR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Maryna Striletska (UKR)\n\nFourth Official: Anastasiya Romanyuk (UKR)\n\nReferee Observer: Ichko Lozev (BUL)\n\nAndorra – England\n\nReferee: David Fuxman (ISR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Sagy Metzamber (ISR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Tom Adi (ISR)\n\nFourth Official: Shalom Avraham (ISR)\n\nReferee Observer: Laurent Duhamel (FRA)\n\nKazakhstan – North Macedonia\n\nReferee: Lukas Fähndrich (SUI)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Marco Zürcher (SUI)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Bekim Zogaj (SUI)\n\nFourth Official: Alain Bieri (SUI)\n\nReferee Observer: Albano Janku (ALB)\n\nSlovakia – Azerbaijan\n\nReferee: Kristoffer Hagenes (NOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Anders Dale (NOR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Isaak Bashevkin (NOR)\n\nFourth Official: Rohit Saggi (NOR)\n\nReferee Observer: Christos Nicolaides (CYP)\n\nCroatia – San Marino\n\nReferee: Ivar Kristjansson (ISL)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Birkir Sigurdarson (ISL)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Johann Gudmundsson (ISL)\n\nFourth Official: Thorvaldur Arnason (ISL)\n\nReferee Observer: Adrian Azzopardi (MLT)\n\nMontenegro – Israel\n\nReferee: Denys Shurman (UKR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Viktor Matyash (UKR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Oleksandr Berkut (UKR)\n\nFourth Official: Dmytro Kryvushkin (UKR)\n\nReferee Observer: Edgar Steinborn (GER)\n\nFaroe Islands – Spain\n\nReferee: David Munro (SCO)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Sean Carr (SCO)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Andrew Kirkland (SCO)\n\nFourth Official: Greg Aitken (SCO)\n\nReferee Observer: Georgi Yordanov (BUL)\n\nNetherlands – Gibraltar\n\nReferee: Christopher Jäger (AUT)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Robert Steinacher (AUT)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Jasmin Sabanović (AUT)\n\nFourth Official: Alan Kijas (AUT)\n\nReferee Observer: Stephane Lannoy (FRA)\n\nFrance – Liechtenstein\n\nReferee: Ian McNabb (NIR)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Georgios Argyropoulos (NIR)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Andrew Nethery (NIR)\n\nFourth Official: Lee Tavinder (NIR)\n\nReferee Observer: Marco Borg (MLT)\n\n↧"
