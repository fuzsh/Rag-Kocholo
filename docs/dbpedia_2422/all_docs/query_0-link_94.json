        "text": "On January 27, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) decided in its executive council meeting that it shall no longer give grades under its accreditation system, and instead switch to a binary category system of “accredited” or “not accredited”. The executive council meeting further decided that it would instead give levels between one and five to institutions to encourage them to reach the highest level of accreditation.\n\nNAAC is a government organisation established in 1994 by the Government of India, to evaluate and accreditate Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in India. NAAC is responsible for establishing benchmark criteria for the evaluation of HEIs in India to maintain minimum higher education requirements w.r.t education, research, faculty, infrastructure etc. NAAC accreditation approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) proves the instant credibility of an institution in India.\n\nThis development has come in after receiving recommendations from an overarching committee set up in November 2022 by former ISRO Chairman Dr K Radhakrishnan. The new changes are proposed with the strategic intent to be consistent with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and lead a new wave of transformative reforms in the approval, assessment & accreditation, and rankings of all HEIs in India.\n\nREAD MORE: Top BA Colleges of India 2023\n\nREAD MORE: Top BA Colleges of India 2023\n\nWhile the binary accreditation is aimed to encourage all institutions to get on board the NAAC accreditation process and improve the overall quality of higher education in India, the Maturity-Based Graded Accreditation (MBGA) is aimed to encourage institutions to raise their bar by improving the standard of imparting education. Institutions from Level 1 to Level 4 will be classified as ‘Institutions of National Excellence’ and institutions of Level 5 will be classified as ‘Institutions of Global Excellence for Multi-Disciplinary Research and Education’.\n\nThese changes are proposed in line with the global best practices set by leading countries in the field of education. The metrics of this grading system are expected to focus on processes, outcomes and impact of HEIs across the board. The implementation of these recommendations will be done in 2 stages. In stage one, the binary accreditation will be implemented in the next four months. The MBGA will be implemented by December 2024."
