Bachelor of Vocational (BVoc), 2. Community College and 3.Dean Dayal Upadyaya Kendra, in the Year 2014-2015 for colleges and universities on the initiative of Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Govt. of India. Abhayapuri took the advantage of this and submitted proposals for all the schemes. College got approval for the first two from UGC, while we had to miss the third one because of inadequacy of infrastructure for the scheme and so we did not appear in the UGC interface meeting at New Delhi.\n\nAbhayapuri College was one of the six colleges of Assam to grab this opportunity to get the UGC approval for opening of two programmes- Information Technology (IT) and Tourism and Travel Management (TTM) under B.Voc Scheme and one programme Banking Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) under Community College Scheme.

To achieve these objectives Govt. of India launched the National Skills Qualifications Frameworks (NSQF) which is competency based framework that organises qualifications according to a series of knowledge, skill and aptitude. These are ten NSQF levels from Level-1 to Level-10 for awarding certifications.
