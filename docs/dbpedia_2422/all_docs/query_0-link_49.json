        "text": "Lumding College was founded on 14th August in the year 1959 by a galaxy of dedicated patriots, philanthropists and academics with a noble mission to disseminate higher education in this remote backward part of the country. It is today one of the most promising institutions of the state of Assam, imparting education in Arts, Science and Commerce at the Higher Secondary and Degree levels. Passing through storm and stress, failure and fortitude over the years, the college has attained a spectacular state of full-fledged growth having an enrolment of 2000 plus students and registering progress in all activities, both academic and co-curricular. The performance of the students of the college at the Higher Secondary and Degree Examinations under the Assam Higher Secondary Education Council and Gauhati University respectively and various extra-curricular events have all along been remarkable. The college has to its credit instances of students occupying top positions in the final examinations.\n\nAffiliated to Gauhati University the college was taken under the deficit system of grant-in-aid by the Govt. of Assam on the 1st December, 1972. In course of time, it was provincialised by the Govt. of Assam on the 1st December in the year 2005. The opening of the study centre of the K.K. Handique State Open University offering degree programmes - BA, B.Sc., B.Com, B.B.A. and B.C.A., is yet another feather in the cap of the college. In order to facilitate the pursuit of post-graduate study in the catchment area, the college has opened a contact centre of the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), G.U., on the campus.\n\nThe college is committed to imparting quality education. It has good and adequate infrastructure such as spacious class rooms, a rich modern computerized library with internet facility, well-equipped laboratories, well-maintained separate common rooms for boys and girls, a well-maintained canteen, girls' hostel, an auditorium (under construction), a play ground, facilities for games and sports, amenity of pure drinking water, vehicle shed etc. Every student is individually taken care of in the process of teaching and learning. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) awarded B+ accreditation to the college in 2004 in recognition of its good standard. The college is now gearing up for re-accreditation by NAAC.\n\nThe college is situated in the heart of the Lumding town in the district of Hojai in the state of Assam. The sprawling campus of the college with a beautiful ambience is within a stone's throw from the Kalibari Bus Stop and hardly 1 K.M. from the Lumding Railway Station. The college is accessible from all parts of the town which has road and rail links from the rest of the country. Auto rickshaw services are available round the clock in the town."
