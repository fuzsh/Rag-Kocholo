        "text": "About Us\n\nForeword\n\nRaha College provides the ideal ambience for students having a desire to pursue higher education in Three-year Degree course in the streams of Arts, Science and Commerce. The College introduced Science and Commerce stream from the academic session 2016-17. Set amidst the meadows and lush green foliage of resplendent trees , in a serene atmosphere within the town, the College offers an ideal location for teaching-learning ambits. It is located at a distance of one and half K.M. from Raha town Natun Chariali and can be approached from three main roads. It is only at a distance of 400 meter from the junction of NH-37 road toward Chaparmukh Railway junction. This seat of higher learning celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2015 and was reaccredited “B” grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The College has three distance education centers at present functioning under Gauhati University and Krishna Kanta Handique State Open University, offering BA and MA programmes, and Assam State Open School (ASOS) offering Higher Secondary level course in Arts stream.\n\nThe dream of setting up a seat of higher learning was achieved through the endeavor, zeal and aspiration of some far-sighted and enlightened social activists of greater Raha area, and it turned into a reality with the establishment of the College on 28th July 1964. Till date, Raha College is the only general degree college in Raha Legislative Assembly Constituency reserved for Scheduled Caste. The College is permanently affiliated to Gauhati University. Apart from the regular degree course, the College also runs the HS course in Arts as per AHSEC curriculum. The College has rich faculty members, a modern library and a Computer Centre. It is worth mentioning that the teaching-learning process has received a fillip with the introduction of state of art digital class rooms constructed with the financial assistance received from the Govt. of Assam. Under RUSA grant, new infrastructure like the new academic building, renovated acoustic auditorium, cycle stand, Science laboratory, renovated classrooms, etc, have been set up."
