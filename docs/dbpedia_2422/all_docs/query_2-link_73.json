        "text": "1978\n\nDepartment of Instrumentation & USIC started as University Science Instrumentation Centre (USIC) in 1978 under USIC scheme of University Grants Commission (UGC) in the department of Physics, GU.\n\nThe department through it's repair and maintenance wing has been rendering services in the field of operation, repair and maintenance of various instruments not only to the departments of this university but also to affiliated colleges and other public and private organizations of the NE region. The center has also successfully completed a number of training programs on repair and maintenance of scientific equipment, glass blowing and use of mechanical workshop equipment. A large number of jobs have been done by the repair and maintenance wing of the department and there by has saved considerable amount of GU exchequer. A considerable amount has been earned from outside institutions by rendering repair and maintenance services. Some of the outside institutions that have availed of repair and maintenance services of the department in past are Handique Girls College, B Barooah College, Forensic Science Lab, Assam and Meghalaya, NERIST, Royal Bhutan Polytechnic, Sherbutse College, Bhutan, Statefed Tripti Vanaspati Plant, Gauhati Medical College & Hospital, Assam Engineering College, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati etc.\n\n1986\n\nIt became a full-fledged department in 1986.\n\nSophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility (SAIF), sponsored by Department of Science and Technology, Govt of India was established in 1986 as a Regional X-ray Facility in the department to cater the need of scientific community from research, academic and industrial organizations. SAIF is rendering analytical services in the field of X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), X-ray Fluoroscence Spectrometry (XRF) and Single Crystal X-ray Diffractometry. SAIF has been regularly participating in the rounds of International Proficiency Test for Analytical Geochemical Laboratories conducted by International Association of Geoanalysts (IAG) and has so far organized six workshops on Theory and Practices of XRD, XRF and SCXRD.\n\n1987-88\n\nThe department was recognized as an academic department in 1987 by the Academic Council, GU. The Post Graduate Diploma in Instrumentation (PGDI) course was started in 1987-88 and was the first such course in the entire NE region which trained qualified engineers and scientists to gain experience in the field of instrumentation. Seventy Five (75) students have passed out PGDI and many of the PGDI passed students are employed in the industries like Oil India Limited (OIL), Gauhati Refinery, Numaligarh Refinery etc.\n\nThe main building of the department was constructed with grants from UGC and was inaugurated by the then Hon-ble Chancellor of GU Sri Bhisma Narayan Singh on 13th August 1988.\n\n1988-92\n\nThe department has been rendering training to persons deputed from outside institutions from time to time. Trainees deputed from NEHU & IASST were trained in the department and revenue has been earned through such training. The department has organized workshops, seminars etc. from time to time. A two weeks training Programme in Electronics and Instrumentation was organized in 1988-89. Another workshop on Repair and Maintenance of Laboratory instruments for college teachers was organized in 1992. The department hosted the National Symposium on Instrumentation ( NSI-17) in 1992.\n\nAt present the practical classes of Workshop Practice of GUIST and MSc Instrumentation are conducted in the workshop of the department.\n\n1994\n\nThe first PhD scholar graduated from this department in 1994. Since then, more than 100 scholars have completed their PhD from this department.\n\n2005\n\nThe name of the department was changed to Department of Instrumentation & USIC in 2005 and MSc in Instrumentation course was introduced with effect from 2004-2005.\n\n2015\n\nThis Course was renamed as MSc in Instrumentation and Applied Physics in 2015 with modifications in the previous syllabus.\n\nTo take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\n\nOn the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.\n\nThese cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.\n\nBut in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.\n\nThe wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
