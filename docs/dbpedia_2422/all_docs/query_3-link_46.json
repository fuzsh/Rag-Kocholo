        "text": "About Our Institute\n\nConsidering the much-awaited and long-felt need for an institution imparting quality education at the higher level of study with an eye on the character building of the younger generation in the Barbhag area of Nalbari District, Barbhag College was established in the year 1964.The birth of this institution was the result of the toil and sacrifices of a few spirited and progressive individuals who worked day and night for years to turn this long cherished dream into reality. Since its inception, the institution has been striving hard to make the rural folk of Barbhag truly educated. The economi- cally backward people of Barbhag area have immensely benefited from this centre of Higher education. It has been successful, to a great extent, in fulfilling the academic aspirations of the people. So far, the students of the college have shown good academic results. The college has been striving, in recent years, to encourage research on diverse subjects. With a view to creating an academic and research environment, a number of conferences and seminars of national importance were successfully organised in the last decade. In keeping with the initiative of encourag- ing research, the college has also brought out a number of research publications. The college has taken, and further intends to take, innovative steps towards improving quality of education in keeping with the fast changing trends in higher education. At present the college is recognised by UGC under 2(f) and 12(B) of the UGC Act and affiliated to Gauhati University and AHSEC."
