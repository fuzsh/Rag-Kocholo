        "text": "About Us :-\n\nAsom Sikshak Prasikshan Mahabidyalaya is one of the premier institutions of teachers' education in Guwahati, Assam (India). It is affiliated to Gauhati University, and recognised by National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE).\n\nAims and objectives :\n\nPursuit of excellence in the field of teachers' education and training is the primary aim of the institution and the objectives for which, the college has set for itself are-\n\nTo enable the prospective teachers to understand the nature, purpose and philosophy of secondary education.\n\nTo develop competency and commitment among the teacher educator for quality education in school.\n\nTo develop communication skills and use modern information technology for school education purposes.\n\nTo foster creative thinking among pupils for reconstruction of knowledge.\n\nTo disseminate knowledge and wisdom through quality education to achieve better individual and social life.\n\nTo provide opportunities for co-curricular education for socio-cultural activities.\n\nEstablishment :\n\nThe history of Education is full of epoch making events. Way back in the early 1990's it was discussed in common educational parlance about the need of a B.Ed. College in the Western Guwahati region. The view was to enhance the professional competence of teachers in general and to get entry into teaching profession in the schools under the care of the Central Govt. in particular. Also among the issues discussed was to refrain from charging exorbitant fees from the pupils as was done by a large number of privately managed institutions at that time so that needy and deserving students could be benefited.\n\nThe issues were taken up under the leadership of Dr. Prabin Chandra Sarma who discussed with the educated class of the people of Pandu, Maligaon and Jalukbari area particularly the Heads of the educational institutions and the teachers of High Schools, Higher Secondary Schools and Colleges..\n\nBeing encouraged by the teachers and the leading citizens of the area, a general meeting was convened on 5th of June 1992 in the Railway Higher Secondary School, Maligaon to which all the Heads of the educational institutions and the teachers ranging from Bharalumukh to Jalukbari area were invited. The meeting was presided over by Sri Rajen Dutta, veteran social worker and was largely attended. After due deliberations it was decided that a B.Ed. College named Asom Sikshak Prasikshan Mahabidyalaya (A.S.P.M.) be started from the academic session 1992-93 and all necessary steps be taken to materialize the B.Ed. College.\n\nAccordingly, a Sponsoring Body was constituted from members drawn from different quarters. The Sponsoring Body elected an Ad-hoc Executive Committee with the following members and advised it to go ahead for the establishment of the ASPM B.Ed. College.\n\nInitial Ad-hoc Executive Committee:\n\n1 President Dr.P.C.Sarma, Principal, Pandu College. 2 Vice-Presidents 1.Dr.B.K. Sarma, G.U. 2.Pl. Madan Mohan Patowary,M.A. 3.Shri Rajen Dutta, Social Worker. 3 Joint Secretaries 1.Dr. H.C. Sarma, G.U. 2.Prof. U.C. Deka, N.G.College. 4 Assistant Secretaries 1.Shri Kabindra Nath Thakuria,Rly.H.S. School. 2.Shri Dinesh Deka. 5 Active Members 1.Shri S.K. Goswami 2.Shri B.K. Barma. 3.Shri S.N. Barman.\n\nThereafter permission was obtained from the Gauhati University authorities after depositing the necessary fees.\n\nAlthough the college was proposed to start functioning from the Railway Higher Secondary School premises, Maligaon but formal permission could not be obtained from the Railway Authorities. Therefore, with due permission from the authorities ASPM started functioning from the Pandu College Premises at a nominal establishment fee of Rs. 100/- per month. ASPM shall remain ever grateful to the Pandu College authorities for their magnanimous help and cooperation in its establishment.\n\nDr. K.P. Borah retired professor of G.U was appointed as the founder principal. The college was inspected by the Inspector of College, Gauhati University on the 4th of February 1993.\n\nThe college later purchased a plot of land at Lankeswar, Jalukbari, Guwahati in 1994 and shifted to its own land in the year 1998 where it is presently functioning.\n\nLocation :\n\nAsom Sikshak Prasikshan Mahabidyalaya is situated at Lankeswar, Jalukbari, Guwahati on south-western part of Guwahati - the gateway of NE-region. The college is situated in close proximity to the Gauhati University campus. It is well connected by road with the National Highway No. 37 passing by it.\n\nName of Present G.B.Members :\n\nSl No. Name Designation Address Contact Number 1 Dr. Dhirendra Nath Das President Garigaon, Ghy.-12 9864018037, 7086420213 2 Md.
