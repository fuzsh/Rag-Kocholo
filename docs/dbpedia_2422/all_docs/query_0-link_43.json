Located in a pollution free idyllic setting near the National Highway No. 31, the college is easily accessible both by road and rail. The college campus covers 30 bighas of land.\n\nThe pioneers of the college under the able stewardship of the Founder Principal Late Ghanashyam Talukdar, a distinguished educationist and socio-political figure of the locality, started it as a night college with a view to providing opportunities to the poor and the deprived students for acquiring higher education. With the active co-operation of the teaching and non-teaching staff, students and the people of the locality, the college authority has been taking up some developmental projects for the uplift of the institution. A sincere endeavour is also being made to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the youths."
