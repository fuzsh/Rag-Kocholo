        "text": "Girijananda Chowdhury Institute of Management and Technology, Guwahati campus was founded on 7 September 2006 as the first non-governmental engineering institute in Assam under the patronage of the Shrimanta Shankar Academy Society. Ever since its inception, the institute’s aim has been to establish a morally sound educational system, which not only produces competent professionals but also excellent human beings contributing towards the welfare of the Society.\n\nThis Institute was established with approval from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi and permission from the State Government. Initially, GIMT was affiliated to the oldest and most reputed University in the State i.e. Gauhati University. Under the policy to bring all the engineering colleges under the same umbrella, Assam Science and Technology University (ASTU) was established by Govt. of Assam and since August 2013, the institute has been affiliated to this University.\n\nThe first session of the Institute commenced on 13 July 2006 with 240 students in four disciplines leading to the Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE),Applied Electronics and Instrumentation (AEI),Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Information Technology (IT). Two more undergraduate programmes in Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Electrical Engineering (EE) were added in the years 2007 and 2008 respectively. Further in the year 2014,Civil Engineering (CE) was established. The first postgraduate course in Business Administration leading to award of MBA degree was introduced in the year 2008. In 2009, the second postgraduate programme in Computer Application leading to award of MCA degree commenced at the institute.\n\nThe Institute also has approval from AICTE for Master of Technology (M. Tech) programme in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE), Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE), and Thermal and Fluid Engineering (TFE).\n\nAlthough only 15 years old, GIMT has already evolved as a pioneer in the field of higher technical education. The quality is further amply recognized when five engineering programmes (B.Tech in AEI, CSE, ME, EE, ECE) were provisionally accredited by NBA in 2016. As an extension to it, in 2019, the B.Tech programmes in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering have been further accredited by NBA for three academic years upto 30.06.2022.\n\nABOUT NATIONAL BOARD OF ACCREDITATION (NBA)\n\nThe National Board of Accreditation (NBA), India was initially established by AICTE ( All India Council of Technical Education ) under section 10(u) of AICTE act. in the year 1994, for periodic evaluation of technical institutions and programmes. India is officially a member of the Washington Accord from 13th June 2014 with the permanent signatory status of the National Board of Accreditation (NBA). This is considered as a significant step of progress for the higher education sector in India.\n\nFIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT NBA\n\n1. It is a kind of recognition which indicates that a programme or degree have international standards.\n\n2. The Washington Accord encourages and facilitates the mobility of engineering and pharmacy graduates and professionals at international level.\n\n3. A student in India graduating from an institute accredited by NBA is eligible to practise as a pharmacy professional/engineer in his/her relevant domain in any of the countries that have signed the Washington Accord (Established in 1989, there are 21 countries with full signatories as of 2018. These are Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States).\n\n4. The Washington Accord is a step forward to do better in the higher-education system in India and allow Indian graduates to compete at a global stage.\n\n5. The only body eligible for the accreditation of the Pharmacy/Engineering courses which can enjoy the privileges of the Washington Accord is “National Board of Accreditation” (NBA) in India.\n\nPROMOTING BODY : SHRIMANTA SHANKAR ACADEMY\n\nShrimanta Shankar Academy Society (SSA) was formed in the year 1992 with its registered office at Dr. J.C. Das Road, Panbazar, Guwahati (Assam).
