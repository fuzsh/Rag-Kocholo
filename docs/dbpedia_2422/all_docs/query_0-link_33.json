        "text": "The college first got affiliated to the Gauhati University in 1980-81 and the government of Assam was pleased to bring it under Deficit System of Grants-in-Aid in 1985. However, when the Assam University came into existence, the college came under its affiliation in 1994.Subsequently U.G.C.'s 2(F) and 12(B) status was granted to the college in 1997 and with this the college became officially competent to enjoy monetary grants from U.G.C. On its way to gradual advancement the college now can boast of having all the three streams of study in its fold, though its sojourn began with only Arts stream.\n\nThe year 2004 turned out to be a significant milestone in the college history. In that year the Peer Team of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) under the chairmanship of broad-hearted Dr. Basudeb Chatterjee (expired in 2010 in a road accident) visited the college and accredited it with B-grade status and the College is again re-accredited (Cycle II) on 27th September, 2016 at the B Grade with CGPA 2.01."
