Neither of the schemes was found suitable.\n\nIn 1944, Bharat Ratna Gopinath Bordoloi (then the first Prime Minister of undivided Assam), Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (who went to become the 5th President of India) and others toured the entire Assam Valley and collected more than 16 lakhs of rupees as donation as a seed money to establish a university in the region.\n\nA bill was placed in the independent Assam Assembly on 15 October, 1947.\n\nFinally the Gauhati University Act came into force on 26th January, 1948.\n\nThe great Sanskrit Scholar, Padma Bhusan, Prof Krishna Kanta Handique was the founder Vice Chancellor.\n\nThe 1st Convocation was held on 3 Feb, 1951 in which the Convocation Address was delivered by Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, the 1st Vice President of India."
