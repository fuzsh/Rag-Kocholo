        "text": "The people of Rangapara and the adjacent areas have been seriously pondering over the idea of starting an institution of higher education for a pretty long time. The seed was firmly put into ground long back in though the sapling took time in coming up. It was in that the inhabitants of Rangapara, Balipara, Chengelimari, Misamari, Charduar, Khanamukh, Ghoramari and the adjoining villages and tea gardens assemble in meeting and got a college managing body formed with Mr. A. J. Singla as the president and Lt. Mahendra Sarmah as the secretary. The committee worked sincerely and industriously under the leadership of Mr. Singla and preliminaries to start a college were completed in no time. The university of Gauhati deputed Mr. Abdul Jalil to inspect and report about the feasibility of having a college here who did it with utmost urgency. Meanwhile, Mr. Lokeswar Gogoi who had taken over as the join secretary of the college contacted Mr. R. P Telfor, the then manager of Phulbari Tea Estate to donate a track of land for the college campus. Mr. Telfor endeavor earnestly brought a gift land measuring 122 bighas 3 kathas of land from M/S Barelly Tea Company, the proprietor. The college expresses it deep sense of gratitude to the management of the tea company. Mr. Telfor or who worked for it and finally got it translated into reality. But then there came a bolt from the blue. The government of Assam came out with a circular on the 31st may, 1975 forbidding people to start new colleges.\n\nThe people’s enthusiasm was greatly dampened no doubt, but they went on working optimistically waiting for a better time to come for realization of that dream. It was in those days of despondency that a god send angle descended in the person of Lt. Hiralal Patowary, an Ex MP. He injected tremendous hopefulness in the people with his address delivered in a meeting organised at Rangapara Namghar. Taking a long stride in future, he donated a sum of Rs 10000 to the college fund, with instruction that the amount be utilized for the college as and when it is borne. His contagious enthusiasm brought forth another donation of Rs 20000 collected from the public at large. The whole amount was kept in fixed deposit in the local branch of UCO Bank, Rangapara and has shaped as the cornered stone of the college. The institution owes its very existence to the departed soul of that great leader and no words can express our gratitude to him.\n\nIn 1979 the govt of Assam came forward with another circular allowing the new college to be opened, wherever necessary. The college committee which has been reconstituted after the death of Mahendra Sarmah began working in full swing to get the college started. It was at this time that Mr. Lakhyadhar Choudhury the then Education Minister of Assam was invited to a meeting of starting college with the initiative of Mr. Golak Ch Kakati an ex MLA. In his address Mr. Choudhury assured the people to extend all kind of help towards opening of college and he kept his word by contacting the authorities of Gauhati University and to care personally so that the college was granted a fare deed. The university deputed Mr. Khitish Medhi, the Inspector of Colleges and Dr. H. P. Das to inspect the college. Their report received favorable response from the university and the permission to start the P.U. classes in arts and Semi Commerce was granted in the subjects of English, Assamese, Bengali, Economics, Political Science, History, Education, Book Keeping and Business Methods.\n\nThe college started functioning with 8 students on the roll. It was inaugurated by Mr. R Borah, IAS, the then DC of Darrang District on the 16th August 1979 in premises of the union theater club, Rangapara. The college acknowledges a profound sense of gratitude to the management of the club for accommodation.\n\nThe college formally shifted to the present site on 16th August, 1983. Our sincere gratitude to Mr. A. J. Singla and other members of the managing committee who took all initiative to construct the present building. The foundation stone laying ceremony was attended by a large number of people from the surrounding area and Makash Bading, a respectable and elderly person from the tea community was the first man to put the concrete mixture in the foundation post. The college authority is indebted to the people of Rangapara, Balipara, Charduar and Missamari , the business community, the tea garden management and employees, tea laborers who paid one day’s wage and TITAN TRUST for their generous financial help to construct the college building and financial assistance that extended during the period of pre deficit to disburse salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff.\n\nProf. M. Dutta served as principal in charge up to the 10th August, 1981, after that Dr. K.N Das took over as the principal till his retirement on 31/08/1990.\n\nWe are thankful to the Govt. of Assam for bringing the college on the Deficit System of grants- in- aid from 01/01/1987.

In 2011 again the college was accredited with B grade by NAAC in the new system of assessment.

The construction and the renovation of boundary wall, old administrative building, college office, library building and canteen building were done with RUSA grant.
