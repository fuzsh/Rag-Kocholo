It generally refers to the earlier concept of a “Course”. A “Course” conveys the title and components of compulsory and optional papers under a “Programme.” We have used the term in a flexible way which while retaining the gamut of meaning of earlier terminology simultaneously covers the ambit of the Subject and its components. This has been done so that the use of the term “Programme” does not create confusion among parents, guardians and students who are accustomed with the earlier notion of a “Course.”"
