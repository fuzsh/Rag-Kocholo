        "text": "Editor-In-Chief: Henry A. Hoff\n\nRadiation astronomy is astronomy applied to the various extraterrestrial sources of radiation, especially at night. It is also conducted above the Earth's atmosphere and at locations away from the Earth, by satellites and space probes, as a part of explorational (or exploratory) radiation astronomy.\n\nSeeing the Sun and feeling the warmth of its rays is probably a student's first encounter with an astronomical radiation source. This will happen from a very early age, but a first understanding of the concepts of radiation may occur at a secondary educational level.\n\nRadiation is all around us on top of the Earth's crust, regolith, and soil, where we live. The study of radiation, including radiation astronomy, usually intensifies at the university undergraduate level.\n\nAnd, generally, radiation becomes hazardous, when a student embarks on graduate study.\n\nCautionary speculation may be introduced unexpectedly to stimulate the imagination and open a small crack in a few doors that may appear closed at present. As such, this learning resource incorporates some state-of-the-art results from the scholarly literature.\n\nThe laboratories of radiation astronomy are limited to the radiation observatories themselves and the computers and other instruments (sometimes off site) used to analyze the results.\n\nMira\n\nA nomy (Latin nomia) is a \"system of laws governing or [the] sum of knowledge regarding a (specified) field.\"[1] Nomology is the \"science of physical and logical laws.\"[1] When any effort to acquire a system of laws or knowledge focusing on an astr, aster, or astro, that is, any natural body in the sky especially at night,[1] succeeds even in its smallest measurement, astronomy is the name of the result.\n\nThe image on the left shows a high velocity binary star and the comet-like trail behind it is light years long. The binary is plowing through the interstellar medium. It's radiating, been radiated, and packs a punch!\n\nRadiation\n\nIn physics, radiation is a process in which energetic particles or energetic waves travel through a medium or space.\n\nDef. an action or process of throwing or sending out a traveling ray of energy in a line, beam, or stream of small cross section is called radiation.\n\nDef. the shooting forth of anything from a point or surface, like the diverging rays of light is called radiation.\n\nThe term radiation is often used to refer to the ray itself.\n\nDifferent types of ionizing radiation behave in different ways, so different shielding techniques are used.\n\nPlanetary sciences\n\nMain article: Radiation astronomy/Planets\n\nPlanetary science is the scientific study of planets (including Earth), natural satellite, moons, and planetary systems, in particular those of the solar system and the processes that form them using the radiation they emit, reflect, fluoresce, or absorb. It studies objects ranging in size from micrometeoroids to gas giants, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly interdisciplinary field, originally growing from astronomy and earth science,[2] but which now incorporates many disciplines, including planetary astronomy, planetary geology (together with geochemistry and geophysics), atmospheric science, oceanography, hydrology, theoretical planetary science, glaciology, and the study of extrasolar planets.[2]\n\nColors\n\nThe peak at 40 keV is not from the mineral. From the color of the rock shown the yellowish mineral is likely to be autunite.\n\nAutunite occurs as an oxidizing product of uranium minerals in granite pegmatites and hydrothermal deposits.\n\nMinerals\n\nMain article: Radiation astronomy/Minerals\n\nUraninite is a radioactive, uranium-rich mineral and ore with a chemical composition that is largely [uranium dioxide] UO2, but also contains [uranium trioxide] UO3 and oxides of lead, thorium, and rare earth elements. It is most commonly known as pitchblende (from pitch, because of its black color. All uraninite minerals contain a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Uraninite also always contains small amounts of the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, the end products of the decay series of the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U respectively. The extremely rare element technetium can be found in uraninite in very small quantities (about 0.2 ng/kg), produced by the spontaneous fission of uranium-238.\n\nThe image at left shows well-formed crystals of uraninite. The image at right shows botryoidal uraninite. Because of the uranium decay products, both sources are gamma-ray emitters.\n\nTheoretical astronomy\n\nMain articles: Astronomy/Theory and Theoretical astronomy\n\nTheoretical astronomy at its simplest is the definition of terms to be applied to astronomical entities, sources, and objects.\n\nDef. an \"expanse of space that seems to be [overhead] like a dome\"[1] is called a sky.\n\nComputer simulations are usually used to represent astronomical phenomena.\n\nPart of the fun of theory is extending the known to what may be known to see if knowing is really occurring, or is it something else.\n\nThe laboratories of astronomy are limited to the observatories themselves. The phenomena observed are located in the heavens, far beyond the reach, let alone control, of the astronomical observer.[3] “So how can one be sure that what one sees out there is subject to the same rules and disciplines of science that govern the local laboratory experiments of physics and chemistry?”[3] “The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.” - Albert Einstein.[3]\n\nTheoretical radiation astronomy\n\nMain article: Theoretical radiation astronomy\n\nAt its simplest theoretical radiation astronomy is the definition of terms to be applied to astronomical radiation phenomena.\n\nDef. a theory of the science of the biological, chemical, physical, and logical laws (or principles) with respect to any natural radiation source in the sky especially at night is called theoretical radiation astronomy.\n\nExploratory theory is the playtime activity that leads to discoveries which better our world. In the radiation physics laboratories here on Earth, the emission, reflection, transmission, absorption, and fluorescence of radiation is studied and laws relative to sources are proven.\n\nA principle is a law or rule that has to be, or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.[4]\n\nRadiation astronomy consists of three fundamental parts:\n\nderivation of logical laws with respect to incoming radiation,\n\nnatural radiation sources outside the Earth, and\n\nthe sky and associated realms with respect to radiation.\n\nDef. a spontaneous emission of an α ray, β ray, or γ ray by the disintegration of an atomic nucleus is called radioactivity.[1]\n\nEntities\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Entities and Entities\n\nRadiation astronomy entities, radiation entities, are any astronomical persons or things that have separate and distinct existences in empirical, objective or conceptual reality.\n\nSome of them, like the astronomers of today, or at any time in the past, are relatively known. But there are many entities that are far less known or understood, such as the observers of ancient times who suggested that deities occupied the sky or the heavens. Likewise, these alleged deities may be entities, or perhaps something a whole lot less.\n\nAstronomical X-ray entities are often discriminated further into sources or objects when more information becomes available, including that from other radiation astronomies.\n\nA researcher who turns on an X-ray generator to study the X-ray emissions in a laboratory so as to understand an apparent astronomical X-ray source is an astronomical X-ray entity. So is one who writes an article about such efforts or a computer simulation to possibly represent such a source.\n\n\"The X-ray luminosity of the dominant group [an entity] is an order of magnitude fainter than that of the X-ray jet.\"[5]\n\nSources\n\nIn source astronomy, the question is \"Where did it come from?\"\n\nSource astronomy has its origins in the actions of intelligent life on Earth when they noticed things or entities falling from above and became aware of the sky. Sometimes what they noticed is an acorn or walnut being dropped on them or thrown at them by a squirrel in a tree. Other events coupled with keen intellect allowed these life forms to deduce that some entities falling from the sky are coming down from locations higher than the tops of local trees.\n\nDef. a source or apparent source detected or “created at or near the time of the [ event or] events” is called a primary source.\n\nDirect observation and tracking of the origination and trajectories of falling entities such as volcanic bombs presented early intelligent life with vital albeit sometimes dangerous opportunities to compose the science that led to source astronomy.\n\nObjects\n\nDef. a hemispherical pit a basinlike opening or mouth about which a cone is often built up any large roughly circular depression or hole is called a crater.\n\nThe image at right shows a chain of 13 craters (Enki Catena) on Ganymede measuring 161.3 km in length. \"The Enki craters formed across the sharp boundary between areas of bright terrain and dark terrain, delimited by a thin trough running diagonally across the center of this image. The ejecta deposit surrounding the craters appears very bright on the bright terrain. Even though all the craters formed nearly simultaneously, it is difficult to discern any ejecta deposit on the dark terrain.\n\nStrong forces\n\nMain articles: Charges/Interactions/Strong and Strong forces\n\n\"In field theory it is known that coupling constants “run”. This means that the values of the coupling constants that one measures depend on the energy at which the measurement is performed. [...] the three different coupling constants [one each for the strong force, electromagnetic force, and the weak force] of the standard model seem to converge to the same value at an energy scale of about 1016 GeV [...] This suggests that there is only one coupling constant at high energies and most likely only one symmetry group. [...] The current belief [is] that the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces [are] unified at about 1016 GeV [as such] one has to rely on [the] particle physics interactions which can lead to electromagnetic radiation and cosmic rays\".[6]\n\nElectromagnetic forces\n\nMain articles: Charges/Interactions/Electromagnetics and Electromagnetics\n\n\"The emission of electromagnetic radiation from a superluminal (faster-than-light in vacuo) charged particle [is such] that no physical principle forbids emission by extended, massless superluminal sources. A polarization current density (dP/dt; see Maxwell's fourth equation) can provide such a source; the individual charged particles creating the polarization do not move faster than c, the speed of light, and yet it is relatively trivial to make the envelope of the polarization current density to do so.\"[7]\n\nThe \"emitted radiation has many unusual characteristics, including: (i) the intensity of some components decays as the inverse of the distance from the source, rather than as 1/(distance)2 (i.e. these components are non-spherically-decaying); (ii) the emission is tightly beamed, the exact direction of the beam depending on the source speed; and (iii) the emission contains very high frequencies not present in the synthesis of the source. Note that the non-spherically decaying components of the radiation do not violate energy conservation. They result from the reception, during a short time period, of radiation emitted over a considerably longer period of (retarded) source time; their strong electromagnetic fields are compensated by weak fields elsewhere [1].\"[7]\n\nThe \"emission occupies a very small polar angular width of order 0.8 degrees in the far field. Based on these findings, we suggest that a superluminal source could act as a highly directional transmitter of MHz or THz signals over very long distances.\"[7]\n\n\"The magnetic field is well-ordered in many jets, as shown by polarization measurements. Synchrotron radiation can be very highly polarized (50%) if the field is globally ordered, and some sources [approach] this level. The electric vectors show clear structure and alignment; an especially common pattern is for the field lines to be along the jet in the inner portions and transition to an azimuthal configuration farther out. This is seen in [PKS0521-36 at 2 cm].\"[8]\n\nWeak forces\n\nMain articles: Charges/Interactions/Weak and Weak forces\n\nThe weak interaction is expressed with respect to nuclear electrons and the continuous β-ray emission spectrum of β decay.[9]\n\n\"The observation of a neutrino burst within 3 h of the associated optical burst from supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud provides a new test of the weak equivalence principle, by demonstrating that neutrinos and photons follow the same trajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy.\"[10]\n\nContinua\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Continua and Continuum astronomy\n\nLyc photon or Ly continuum photon or Lyman continuum photon are a kind of photon emitted from stars. Hydrogen is ionized by absorption of Lyc photons. Lyc photons are in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of the hydrogen atom and immediately next to the limit of the Lyman series of the spectrum with wavelengths that are shorter than 91.1267 nanometres and with energy above 13.6 eV.\n\nEmissions\n\n\"[T]he extended red emission (ERE) [is] observed in many dusty astronomical environments, in particular, the diffuse interstellar medium of the Galaxy. ... silicon nanoparticles provide the best match to the spectrum and the efficiency requirement of the ERE.\"[11]\n\nAbsorptions\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Absorptions and Absorption astronomy\n\n\"[P]referential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon\".[12]\n\n\"For quenched galaxies, the Hα absorption trough is deep and can be traced through the nucleus and along the major axis. It extends to a radius at or beyond 2 Rd [where Rd is the galaxy disk scale length] in all but three cases. This makes it possible to determine a velocity width from the optical spectrum as is done for emission line flux, with appropriate corrections between stellar and gas velocities (see discussion in Paper I, also Neistein, Maoz, Rix, & Tonry, 1999). In the few cases where a velocity width can also be measured from the H I data, it is found to be in good agreement with that taken from the Hα absorption line flux.\"[13]\n\nBands\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Bands and Band astronomy\n\nAt the right is Saturn imaged by the Stockholm Infrared Camera (SIRCA) in the H2O infrared band to show the presence of water vapor. The image is cut off near the top due to the presence of Saturn's rings.\n\nThe Sun's emission in the lowest UV bands, the UVA, UVB, and UVC bands, are of interest, as these are the UV bands commonly encountered from artificial sources on Earth. The shorter bands of UVC, as well as even more energetic radiation as produced by the Sun, generate the ozone in the ozone layer when single oxygen atoms produced by UV photolysis of dioxygen react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer is especially important in blocking UVB and part of UVC, since the shortest wavelengths of UVC (and those even shorter) are blocked by ordinary air.\n\nBackgrounds\n\nMain articles: Astronomy/Backgrounds and Background astronomy\n\nIn the figure at right, CUVOB stands for the cosmic ultraviolet and optical background.\n\nThe diffuse extragalactic background light (EBL) is all the accumulated radiation in the Universe due to star formation processes, plus a contribution from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This radiation covers the wavelength range between ~ 0.1-1000 microns (these are the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum). The EBL is part of the diffuse extragalactic background radiation (DEBRA), which by definition covers the overall electromagnetic spectrum. After the cosmic microwave background, the EBL produces the second-most energetic diffuse background, thus being essential for understanding the full energy balance of the universe.\n\nGalaxy clusters\n\n\"Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are not uniformly distributed in the Universe, instead they collect into vast clusters and sheets and walls of galaxies interspersed with large voids in which very few galaxies seem to exist. The map above shows many of these superclusters including the Virgo supercluster - the minor supercluster of which our galaxy is just a minor member. The entire map is approximately 7 percent of the diameter of the entire visible Universe.\"[14]\n\nHigh-velocity galaxies\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/High-velocity galaxies and High-velocity galaxies\n\n\"The irregular galaxy NGC 1427A is a spectacular example of the resulting stellar rumble. Under the gravitational grasp of a large gang of galaxies, called the Fornax cluster, the small bluish galaxy is plunging headlong into the group at 600 kilometers per second or nearly 400 miles per second.\"[15]\n\n\"Galaxy clusters, like the Fornax cluster, contain hundreds or even thousands of individual galaxies. Within the Fornax cluster, there is a considerable amount of gas lying between the galaxies. When the gas within NGC 1427A collides with the Fornax gas, it is compressed to the point that it starts to collapse under its own gravity. This leads to formation of the myriad of new stars seen across NGC 1427A, which give the galaxy an overall arrowhead shape that appears to point in the direction of the galaxy's high-velocity motion.\"[15]\n\nGalaxies\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Galaxies and Galaxy radiation astronomy\n\nThe radiation astronomy of galaxies generally is about the galaxy as a radiated or radiation emitting astronomical object. The stellar aspects of individual galaxies are in galaxies of stars.\n\nA galaxy is often perceived as a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.[16][17] Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (Template:10^) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (Template:10^) stars,[18] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.\n\nGalaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[19] spiral, or irregular.[20]\n\nThe number of galaxies in the observable universe has increased from a previous estimate of 200 billion (7011200000000000000♠2×1011)[21] to a suggested 2 trillion (7012200000000000000♠2×1012) or more,[22][23] containing more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth.[24]\n\nActive galactic nuclei\n\nThere is \"a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 6 x 1019 electron volts and the positions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) lying within ~75 megaparsecs.\"[25]\n\nSome low energy cosmic rays originate or are associated with solar flares. Even these cosmic rays have too high an energy to originate from the solar photosphere. The coronal cloud in close proximity to the Sun may be a source or create them as it bombards the chromosphere from above.\n\n\"In particular we recognize a first trace of Vela, brightest gamma and radio galactic source, and smeared sources along Galactic Plane and Center [as a source of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR)].\"[26]\n\n\"The main correlated map is the 408 MHz one. The first astronomical source that seem to correlate is the main multiplet along CenA. This AGN source, the nearest extragalactic one, sits in the same direction of a far Centaurus Cluster (part of the Super-Galactic Plane). The blurring by random galactic magnetic field might spread the nearest AGN event along the same Super-Galactic Plane, explaining the AUGER group miss-understanding [3].\"[26]\n\nNebulas\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Nebulas and Nebula astronomy\n\n\"The Horsehead Nebula, a part of the optical nebula IC434 and also known as Barnard 33, was first recorded in 1888 on a photographic plate taken at the Harvard College Observatory. Its coincidental appearance as the profile of a horse's head and neck has led to its becoming one of the most familiar astronomical objects. It is, in fact, an extremely dense cloud projecting in front of the ionized gas that provides the pink glow so nicely revealed in this picture. We know this not only because the underside of the 'neck' is especially dark, but because it actually casts a shadow on the field to its east (below the 'muzzle').\"[27]\n\nHypervelocity stars\n\nDef. a star moving faster than 65 km/s to 100 km/s relative to the average motion of the stars in the Sun's neighbourhood is called a high-velocity star.\n\nDef. a high-velocity star moving through space with an abnormally high velocity relative to the surrounding interstellar medium is called a runaway star.\n\nDef. a star whose elliptical orbit takes it well outside the plane of [its galaxy] at steep angles is called a halo star.\n\nMeteors\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Meteors and Meteor astronomy\n\nA meteor is the visible path of a meteoroid that has entered the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAlthough there are many definitions of a meteor ranging from any atmospheric phenomenon to a fast-moving streak of light in the night sky caused by the entry of extraterrestrial matter into the earth's atmosphere: A shooting star or falling star, for radiation astronomy, an alternative definition is used.\n\nHere's a theoretical definition of a meteor from a radiation point of view:\n\nDef. any natural object radiating through a portion or all of the Earth's or another natural object's atmosphere is called a meteor.\n\nA hypervelocity star \"snow-plowing\" through the interstellar medium of a galaxy is a meteor and the subject of meteor astronomy.\n\nMeteor astronomy (radiated meteors) is radiation astronomy of large matter objects moving rapidly relative to apparently fixed objects.\n\nA meteor may be as small as an electron. Astronomical objects that are atoms, nuclei, or subatomic particles are part of cosmic-ray astronomy.\n\nCosmic rays\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Cosmic rays and Cosmic-ray astronomy\n\nThe graph on the right shows an inverse correlation between sunspot numbers (solar activity) and neutron production from galactic cosmic rays.\n\nThere is \"a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 6 x 1019 electron volts and the positions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) lying within ~75 megaparsecs.\"[25]\n\nThe Oh-My-God particle was observed on the evening of 15 October 1991 over Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. Its observation was a shock to astrophysicists, who estimated its energy to be approximately 7001480652946100000♠3×1020 eV[28](50 joules)—in other words, a subatomic particle with kinetic energy equal to that of a baseball (142 g or 5 oz) traveling at 100 km/h (60 mph).\n\nIt was most probably a proton with a speed very close to the speed of light, so close, in fact, [(1 − 6976500000000000000♠5×10−24) × c], that in a year-long race between light and the cosmic ray, the ray would fall behind only 46 nanometers (6976500000000000000♠5×10−24 light-years), or 0.15 femtoseconds (6984150000000000000♠1.5×10−16 s).[29]\n\nNeutrals\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Neutrals and Neutrals astronomy\n\n\"A giant cosmic necklace glows brightly in this Nasa Hubble Space Telescope image.\"[30]\n\n\"The object, aptly named the Necklace Nebula, is a recently discovered planetary nebula, the glowing remains of an ordinary, sun-like star.\"[30]\n\n\"The nebula consists of a bright ring, measuring 12trillion miles wide, dotted with dense, bright knots of gas that resemble diamonds in a necklace.\"[30]\n\n\"Newly discovered: The Necklace Nebula glows brightly in this composite image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope last month. The glow of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are shown by the colours blue, green and red respectively\".[30]\n\n\"It is located 15,000 light-years away in the constellation Sagitta.\"[30]\n\n\"A pair of stars orbiting close together produced the nebula, also called PN G054.2-03.4.\"[30]\n\n\"About 10,000 years ago, one of the ageing stars ballooned to the point where it engulfed its companion star. The smaller star continued orbiting inside its larger companion, increasing the giant’s rotation rate. The bloated companion star spun so fast that a large part of its gaseous envelope expanded into space. Due to centrifugal force, most of the gas escaped along the star’s equator, producing a ring. The embedded bright knots are dense gas clumps in the ring. The pair is so close, only a few million miles apart, that they appear as one bright dot in the centre. The stars are furiously whirling around each other, completing an orbit in a little more than a day.\"[30]\n\nSubatomics\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Subatomics and Subatomic astronomy\n\nAn \"analysis of the energy-loss distributions in the GRS HEM during the impulsive phase of this event indicates that γ-rays from the decay of π0 mesons were detected [...] The production of pions, which is accompanied (on average) by neutrons, has an energy threshold of ~290 MeV for p-p and ~180 MeV for p-α interactions, giving, therefore, a lower limit to the maximum energy of the particles accelerated at the Sun.\"[31]\n\nHadrons\n\nA hadron, like an atomic nucleus, is a composite particle held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons.\n\nBaryons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Baryons and Baryons\n\nA baryon is a composite subatomic particle bound together by the strong interaction, whereas leptons are not. The most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe. Electrons (the other major component of the atom) are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (antibaryon).\n\nBaryonic matter is matter composed mostly of baryons (by mass), which includes atoms of any sort (and thus includes nearly all matter that may be encountered or experienced in everyday life).\n\nNeutrons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Neutrons and Neutron astronomy\n\nAround EeV (1018 eV) energies, there may be associated ultra high energy neutrons \"observed in anisotropic clustering ... because of the relativistic neutrons boosted lifetime.\"[32] “[A]t En = 1020 eV, [these neutrons] are flying a Mpc, with their directional arrival (or late decayed proton arrival) ... more on-line toward the source.”[32] From “neutron (and anti-neutron) life-lengths (while being marginal or meaningless at tens of Mpcs)\", the growth of their half-lives with energy may naturally explain an associated, showering neutrino halo.[32]\n\nFairly large fluxes of neutrons have been observed during solar flares such as that of November 12, 1960, with a flux of 30-70 neutrons per cm-2 s-1.[33]\n\nAt right is the result of an all Moon survey by the Lunar Prospector using an onboard neutron spectrometer (NS). Cosmic rays impacting the lunar surface generate neutrons which in turn lose much of their energy in collisions with hydrogen atoms trapped within the Moon's surface.[34] Some of these thermal neutrons collide with the helium atoms within the NS to yield an energy signature which is detected and counted.[34] The NS aboard the Lunar Prospector has a surface resolution of 150 km.[34]\n\nProtons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Protons and Proton astronomy\n\n\"Proton astronomy should be possible; it may also provide indirect information on inter-galactic magnetic fields.\"[35]\n\nProton astronomy per se often consists of directly or indirectly detecting the protons and deconvoluting a spatial, temporal, and spectral distribution.\n\n“[A]t the high end of the proton energy spectrum (above ≈ 1018 eV) [the Larmor radius] deflection becomes small enough that proton astronomy becomes possible.”[36]\n\n\"The third largest solar proton event in the past thirty years took place during July 14-16, 2000, and had a significant impact on the earth's atmosphere.\"[37]\n\nMesons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Mesons and Meson astronomy\n\nA meson is a composite subatomic particle \"bound together by the strong interaction.\n\nBecause mesons are composed of sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a radius roughly one femtometre, which is about 2/3 the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through intermediate particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons.\n\nMesons are not produced by radioactive decay, but appear in nature only as short-lived products of very high-energy interactions in matter. In cosmic ray interactions, for example, such particles are ordinary protons and neutrons. Mesons are also frequently produced artificially in high-energy particle accelerators that collide protons, anti-protons, or other particles.\n\nIn nature, the importance of lighter mesons is that they are the associated quantum-field particles that transmit the nuclear force, in the same way that photons are the particles that transmit the electromagnetic force.\n\nEach type of meson has a corresponding antiparticle (antimeson) in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice-versa.\n\nMesons are subject to both the weak and strong interactions. Mesons with net electric charge also participate in the electromagnetic interaction.\n\nWhile no meson is stable, those of lower mass are nonetheless more stable than the most massive mesons, and are easier to observe and study in particle accelerators or in cosmic ray experiments. They are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and thus exhibit certain higher energy phenomena more readily than baryons composed of the same quarks would.\n\nBeta particles\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Beta particles and Beta-particle astronomy\n\nA number of subatomic reactions can be detected in astronomy that yield beta particles. The detection of beta particles or the reactions that include them in an astronomical situation is beta-particles astronomy.\n\nBeta particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons.\n\nBeta particles may be the key to fusion. \"If the exterior of the capsule is maintained at a uniform temperature of about 19.5 K, the natural beta decay energy of the tritium will accomplish this through a process known as \"beta layering.\" The very low energy beta particles from tritium decay deposit their energy very close to the location of the original tritium atoms.\"[38]\n\n\"Beta-particles leaving the upper surface of the lunar sample could trigger the upper beta detector, while the lower beta-detector was triggered by beta particles from the lower surface of the sample.\"[39]\n\nNotation: let the symbol β− designate an unbound electron in motion.\n\nNotation: let β+ designate an unbound positron in motion.\n\nNotation: let TGF stand for a Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flash.\n\nElectrons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Electrons and Electron astronomy\n\nAlthough electron astronomy is usually not recognized as a formal branch of astronomy, the measurement of electron fluxes help to understand a variety of natural phenomena.\n\nParticles such as electrons are used as tracers of cosmic magnetic fields.[41] \"From a plasma-physics point of view, the particles represent the correct way to identify magnetic field lines.\"[41] \"The suprathermal electrons in the solar wind and in solar particle events have excellent properties for this application: they move rapidly, they remain tightly bound to their field lines, and they may arrive \"scatter-free\" even at low energies, and from deep in the solar atmosphere (Lin 1985).\"[41] These electrons \"provide remote-sensing observations of distant targets in the heliosphere - the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter, and various heliospheric structures.\"[41] \"\"[E]lectron astronomy\" has an interesting future\".[41]\n\nA delta ray is characterized by very fast electrons produced in quantity by alpha particles or other fast energetic charged particles knocking orbiting electrons out of atoms. Collectively, these electrons are defined as delta radiation when they have sufficient energy to ionize further atoms through subsequent interactions on their own.\n\n\"The conventional procedure of delta-ray counting to measure charge (Powell, Fowler, and Perkins 1959), which was limited to resolution σz = 1-2 because of uncertainties of the criterion of delta-ray ranges, has been significantly improved by the application of delta-ray range distribution measurements for 16O and 32S data of 200 GeV per nucleon (Takahashi 1988; Parnell et al. 1989).\"[42] Here, the delta-ray tracks in emulsion chambers have been used for \"[d]irect measurements of cosmic-ray nuclei above 1 TeV/nucleon ... in a series of balloon-borne experiments\".[42]\n\nPositrons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Positrons and Positron astronomy\n\n\"Positron astronomy is 30 years old but remains in its infancy.\"[43]\n\n\"[P]ositron astronomy results ... have been obtained using the INTEGRAL spectrometer SPI\".[44] The positrons are not directly observed by the INTEGRAL space telescope, but \"the 511 keV positron annihilation emission is\".[44]\n\nDuring solar flares “[s]everal radioactive nuclei that emit positrons are also produced; [which] slow down and annihilate in flight with the emission of two 511 keV photons or form positronium with the emission of either a three gamma continuum (each photon < 511 keV) or two 511 keV photons.\"[45]\n\nMuons\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Muons and Muon astronomy\n\n\"TeV muons from γ ray primaries ... are rare because they are only produced by higher energy γ rays whose flux is suppressed by the decreasing flux at the source and by absorption on interstellar light.\"[46]\n\nMuon decay produces three particles, an electron plus two neutrinos of different types.\n\nNeutrinos\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Neutrinos and Neutrino astronomy\n\nThe field of neutrino astronomy is still very much in its infancy – the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far are the Sun and supernova SN1987A. Neutrino astronomy observes astronomical objects with neutrino detectors in special observatories.\n\nBecause neutrinos are only weakly interacting with other particles of matter, neutrino detectors must be very large in order to detect a significant number of neutrinos. Neutrino detectors are often built underground to isolate the detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation.[47]\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande, or \"Super-K\" is a large-scale experiment constructed in an unused mine in Japan to detect and study neutrinos. The image at right required 500 days worth of data to produce the \"neutrino image\" of the Sun. The image is centered on the Sun's position. This image covers a 90° x 90° octant of the sky (in right ascension and declination). The higher the brightness of the color, the larger is the neutrino flux.\n\nElectromagnetics\n\nRadiation astronomy is often performed using electromagnetics. Electromagnetics are most familiar as light, or electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe image at right is a colour \"composite image of RCW120. It reveals how an expanding bubble of ionised gas about ten light-years across is causing the surrounding material to collapse into dense clumps where new stars are then formed. The 870-micron submillimetre-wavelength data were taken with the LABOCA camera on the 12-m Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope. Here, the submillimetre emission is shown as the blue clouds surrounding the reddish glow of the ionised gas (shown with data from the SuperCosmos H-alpha survey). The image also contains data from the Second Generation Digitized Sky Survey (I-band shown in blue, R-band shown in red).\"[48]\n\nElectromagnetic radiation astronomy is a broader concept, physics subject heading used by the American Physical Society (APS).[49]\n\nGamma rays\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Gamma rays and Gamma-ray astronomy\n\nMost astronomical gamma-rays are thought to be produced not from radioactive decay, however, but from the same type of accelerations of electrons, and electron-photon interactions, that produce X-rays in astronomy (but occurring at a higher energy in the production of gamma-rays).\n\nFor gamma-ray astronomy, the Vela satellites were the first devices ever to detect cosmic gamma ray bursts.\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe. Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes, although a typical burst lasts 20–40 seconds. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived \"afterglow\" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio).[50]\n\nX-rays\n\nX-rays are electromagnetic radiation from a portion of the wavelength spectrum of about 5 to 8 nanometers (nm)s down to approximately 5 to 8 picometers (pm)s (ranging over three orders of magnitude).\n\nAn astronomical X-ray source may have one or more positional locations, plus associated error circles or boxes, from which incoming X-radiation (X-rays) has been detected.\n\nGenerally, a coronal cloud, a cloud composed of plasma, is usually associated with a star or other celestial or astronomical body, extending sometimes millions of kilometers into space, or thousands of light-years, depending on the associated body. The high temperature of the coronal cloud gives it unusual spectral features. These features have been traced to highly ionized atoms of elements such as iron which indicate a plasma's temperature in excess of 106 K (MK) and associated emission of X-rays.\n\nThe importance of X-ray astronomy is exemplified in the use of an X-ray imager such as the one on GOES 14 for the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME)s and other X-ray generating phenomena that impact the Earth.\n\nUltraviolets\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Ultraviolets and Ultraviolet astronomy\n\nUltraviolet astronomy is generally used to refer to observations of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres.\n\nThere are many important spectral lines in these wavelengths. Among the most important are the Lyman lines, which are emitted or absorbed when an electron jumps to or from the innermost electron shell in a hydrogen atom. The first three (known as alpha, beta and gamma) have wavelengths of 121.52, 102.53 and 97.22 nm respectively.[51]\n\nSince the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs ultraviolet light, especially the shorter wavelengths, ultraviolet astronomy is mostly conducted by satellites. Longer wavelengths can be detected from baloons launched into the stratosphere.\n\nLike the English astronomer William Fox, \"In the summer of 1980, reflecting his age, Walter Scott Houston finally underwent surgery to remove a cataract from his right eye. Now to just about anyone else, a cataract would spell the end of a sky gazing career. But not Houston. With his lens removed and a plastic UV-transparent replacement implanted, Scotty reported that a whole new world of star gazing was opened up. The flood of ultraviolet light onto his retina allowed him to see faint blue stars previously invisible by at least one magnitude above the visual limit (to normally sighted observers).\"[52]\n\nOpticals\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Opticals and Optical astronomy\n\nOptical astronomy includes those portions of ultraviolet, visual, and infrared astronomy that benefit from the use of quartz crystal or silica glass telescope components.\n\nObservations at these wavelengths generally use optical components (mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors).\n\nIn popular culture optical astronomy encompasses a wide variety of observations via telescopes that are sensitive in the range of visible light. Scientists would call this visible-light astronomy. It includes imaging, where a picture of some sort is made of the object; photometry, where the amount of light coming from an object is measured, spectroscopy, where the distribution of that light with respect to its wavelength is measured, and polarimetry where the polarisation state of that light is measured.\n\nDef. astronomy using infrared, visible and/or ultraviolet wavelengths is called optical astronomy.\n\nDef. an optical system in telescopes that reduces atmospheric distortion by dynamically measuring and correcting wavefront aberrations in real time, often by using a deformable mirror is called adaptive optics.\n\n\"Already it has allowed ground-based telescopes to produce images with sharpness rivalling those from the Hubble Space Telescope. The technique is expected to revolutionize the future of ground-based optical astronomy.\"[53]\n\nThe color index is a simple numerical expression that determines the color of an object, which in the case of a star gives its temperature. To measure the index, one observes the magnitude of an object successively through two different filters, such as U and B, or B and V, where U is sensitive to ultraviolet rays, B is sensitive to blue light, and V is sensitive to visible (green-yellow) light (see also: UBV system). The set of passbands or filters is called a photometric system. The difference in magnitudes found with these filters is called the U-B or B–V color index, respectively. The smaller the color index, the more blue (or hotter) the object is. Conversely, the larger the color index, the more red (or cooler) the object is. This is a consequence of the logarithmic magnitude scale, in which brighter objects have smaller (more negative) magnitudes than dimmer ones. For comparison, the yellowish Sun has a B–V index of 0.656 ± 0.005,[54] while the bluish Rigel has B–V –0.03 (its B magnitude is 0.09 and its V magnitude is 0.12, B–V = –0.03).[55] The passbands most optical astronomers use are the UBVRI filters, where the U, B, and V filters are as mentioned above, the R filter passes red light, and the I filter passes infrared light. These filters were specified as particular combinations of glass filters and photomultiplier tubes.\n\nAn optical telescope gathers and focuses light mainly from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (although some work in the infrared and ultraviolet).[56]\n\nVisuals\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Visuals and Visual astronomy\n\nWhat is “the “old-fashioned” spirit of real-time visual astronomy”?[57] “I think everyone can conjure up a mental image of astronomers at every level and place in history, gazing through the eyepieces of their telescopes at sights far away - true visual astronomy.”[57]\n\nViolets\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Violets and Violet astronomy\n\n\"The aluminium abundance was derived from the resonance line at 394.4nm, and Al is underabundant by ∼ −0.7 dex with respect to iron.\"[58] \"These abundances are the LTE values; no NLTE corrections, as prescribed by Baum ̈uller and Gehren (1997) and Baumüller et al. (1998), have been applied. The prescribed NLTE corrections for Teff = 6500K, log g = 4.0, [Fe/H] = –3.0 are –0.11 ... for ... Al .... If we assume these values to apply for our lower-gravity star [CS 29497-030], then Al follows iron\"[58]. The elemental abundance ratios for CS 29497-030 of aluminum are [Al/H] = -3.37, [Al/Fe] = -0.67.[58]\n\nA discovery in violet astronomy is that \"carbon stars are enormously fainter in the violet region than expected from appropriate blackbody spectra.\"[59]\n\nViolet photographs of the planet Venus taken in 1927 “recorded two nebulous bright streaks, or bands, running ... approximately at right angles to the terminator” that may be from the upper atmosphere.[60]\n\n\"The “Purple Haze” is a diffuse blueish/purple glow within a few arcseconds of the central star in HST images of the Homunculus (Morse et al. 1998; Smith et al. 2000, 2004). This emission is seen in excess of violet starlight scattered by dust, and the strength of the excess increases into the far UV (Smith et al. 2004; hereafter Paper I).\"[61]\n\nBlues\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Blues and Blue astronomy\n\nBlue astronomy is focused on the wavelength range 450-475 nm.\n\nStars are often referred to by their predominant color. For example, blue stragglers are found among the galactic halo globular clusters.[62] Blue main sequence stars that are metal poor ([Fe/H] ≤ -1.0) are most likely very different in origin from blue stragglers.[62]\n\n\"[G]round-based UV [and blue astronomy] is a powerful facility for [the] study of [the] chemical evolution of [the] early Galaxy.\"[63] UV and B astronomy use radiation over the wavelength range 355.0-500.0 nm.[63]\n\n“To date, all of the reported hypervelocity stars (HVSs), which are believed to be ejected from the Galactic center, are blue and therefore almost certainly young.”[64]\n\nA trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane occur at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue,[65] although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Since Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.[66]\n\nCyans\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Cyans and Cyan astronomy\n\nPerhaps the most prominent cyan planetary source is Uranus, which has only been visited by the space probe Voyager 2. More recent images come from the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around Earth.\n\nMethane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR) making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in color.[67]\n\n“During the Halley Monitoring Program at La Silla from Feb.17 to Apr.17,1986 ... In the light of the neutral CN-radical a continuous formation and expansion of [cyan] gas-shells could be observed.”[68] “The gas-expansion velocity decreases with increasing heliocentric distance from 1 km/s in early March to 0.8 km/s in April.”[68]\n\nShown at right, \"Lulin's green color comes from the gases that make up its Jupiter-sized atmosphere. Jets spewing from the comet's nucleus contain cyanogen (CN: a poisonous gas found in many comets) and diatomic carbon (C2). Both substances glow green when illuminated by sunlight\"[69]\n\nThe electric blue glow of electricity results from the spectral emission of the excited ionized atoms (or excited molecules) of air (mostly oxygen and nitrogen) falling back to unexcited states, which happens to produce an abundance of electric blue light. This is the reason electrical sparks in air, including lightning, appear electric blue. It is a coincidence that the color of Cherenkov radiation and light emitted by ionized air are a very similar blue despite their very different methods of production.\n\nGreens\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Greens and Green astronomy\n\nGreen objects or emission lines in the green portion of the visible spectrum are the subject of green astronomy.\n\nIn the image at right the iron (Fe XIV) green line is followed by doppler imaging to show associated relative coronal plasma velocity towards (-7 km/s side) and away from (+7 km/s side) the large angle spectrometric coronagraph LASCO satellite camera.\n\n\"Carroll and McCormack (1972) in Dublin reported complex spectra in the blue and green wavelength regions of both FeH and FeD\".[70]\n\nFor elongated dust particles in cometary comas an investigation is performed at 535.0 nm (green) and 627.4 nm (red) peak transmission wavelengths of the Rosetta spacecraft's OSIRIS Wide Angle Camera broadband green and red filters, respectively.[71] \"In the green, the polarization of the pure silicate composition qualitatively appears a better fit to the shape of the observed polarization curves\".[71] \"[B]ut they are characterized by a high albedo.\"[71] The silicates used to model the cometary coma dust are olivene (Mg-rich is green) and the pyroxene, enstatite.[71]\n\nIn December 2006, seven papers were published in the scientific journal, Science, discussing initial details of the sample analysis. Among the findings are: a wide range of organic compounds, including two that contain biologically usable nitrogen; indigenous aliphatic hydrocarbons with longer chain lengths than those observed in the diffuse interstellar medium; abundant amorphous silicates in addition to crystalline silicates such as olivine and pyroxene, proving consistency with the mixing of solar system and interstellar matter, previously deduced spectroscopically from ground observations;[72] hydrous silicates and carbonate minerals were found to be absent, suggesting a lack of aqueous processing of the cometary dust; limited pure carbon (CHON) was also found in the samples returned; methylamine and ethylamine was found in the aerogel but was not associated with specific particles.\n\nYellows\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Yellows and Yellow astronomy\n\nYellow astronomy is astronomy applied to the various extraterrestrial yellow sources of radiation, especially at night. It is also conducted above the Earth's atmosphere and at locations away from the Earth as a part of explorational (or exploratory) yellow astronomy.\n\nThere are yellow objects and emission lines in the yellow portion of the visible spectrum from 570 to 590 nm in wavelength.\n\nIo is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter and, with a diameter of 3,642 kilometres (2,263 mi), the fourth-largest moon in the Solar System. With over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System.[73][74] Most of Io's surface is characterized by extensive plains coated with sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost. Io's volcanism is responsible for many of the satellite's unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur.\n\nOranges\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Oranges and Orange astronomy\n\n\"[O]range [is] the color of Jupiter\"[75].\n\nThe orange and brown coloration in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are believed to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.[76][77] These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.[78]\n\nThe orange system [in orange astronomy] is a number of emission lines very close together forming a band in the orange portion of the visible spectrum. These lines are usually associated with particular molecular species, including ScO, YO, and TiO.[79]\n\nThe orange band from molecular CaCl is \"observed in the spectra of many carbon stars.\"[80]\n\nThe Fe VII emission line at 608.7 nm, \"frequently observed in the spectra of astrophysical plasmas\", has been detected in planetary nebulae, Seyfert galaxies, and quasars.[81]\n\nReds\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Reds and Red astronomy\n\nWith respect to the color 'red', there are studies of the redness of objects such as the red dwarf AZ Cancri shown in the visual image at right. Cool stars of spectral class M appear red; they are (depending on their size) referred to as \"red giants\" or \"red dwarfs\".\n\n\"Ideally all intrinsic colours should be found from unreddened stars. This is possible for dwarf and giant stars later than about A0 (Johnson, 1964) ... However, it cannot be used for stars of other spectral classes since they are all relatively infrequent in space, and generally reddened.\"[82]\n\nA very important wavelength in this region is the Balmer alpha line, 656.28 nm. It is emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms when electrons move between the second and third electron shells. Other Balmer lines, known as beta, gamma and delta, have wavelengths of 486.13, 434.05 and 410.17 nm respectively;[3] these are also in the visual range but are less important than the alpha line.\n\nInfrareds\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Infrareds and Infrared astronomy\n\nThe wavelength of infrared light ranges from 0.75 to 300 micrometers. Infrared falls in between visible radiation, which ranges from 380 to 750 nanometers, and terahertz radiation submillimeter waves.\n\nInfrared and optical astronomy are often practiced using the same telescopes, as the same mirrors or lenses are usually effective over a wavelength range that includes both visible and infrared light.\n\nFar-infrared astronomy deals with objects visible in far-infrared radiation extending from 30 micron (µm) towards submillimeter wavelengths around 450 µm.\n\nHuge, cold clouds of gas and dust in [the Milky Way] our own galaxy, as well as in nearby galaxies, glow in far-infrared light. This is due to thermal radiation of interstellar dust contained in molecular clouds.\n\nVisually dark infrared sources can be radiative cosmic dust, hydrogen gas such as an H II region (e.g. the Orion Nebula), an H I region of hydrogen, a molecular cloud, or a coronal cloud.\n\nThere are about 1,892,100 infrared (IR) objects in the SIMBAD database. Some of these like IRAS 20542+3631 are only IR objects. 1RXS J205444.6+361116 is an IR and an X-ray object only. These objects are visibly dark infrared sources. As is 2MASS J21074764+3802561, which is an IR and UV object only.\n\nSubmillimeters\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Submillimeters and Submillimeter astronomy\n\nSubmillimetre astronomy or submillimeter astronomy is the branch of observational astronomy that is conducted at submillimetre wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astronomers place the submillimetre waveband between the far-infrared and microwave wavebands, typically taken to be between a few hundred micrometres and a millimetre.\" and \"Using submillimetre observations, astronomers examine molecular clouds and dark cloud cores with a goal of clarifying the process of star formation from earliest collapse to stellar birth.\n\nThese wavelengths are sometimes called Terahertz radiation, since they have frequencies of the order of 1 THz.\n\n\"The Antennae Galaxies (also known as NGC 4038 and 4039) are a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light-years away, in the constellation of Corvus (The Crow). This view combines ALMA observations, made in two different wavelength ranges during the observatory’s early testing phase, with visible-light observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.\"[83]\n\n\"The Hubble image is the sharpest view of this object ever taken and serves as the ultimate benchmark in terms of resolution. ALMA observes at much longer wavelengths which makes it much harder to obtain comparably sharp images. However, when the full ALMA array is completed its vision will be up to ten times sharper than Hubble.\"[83]\n\nMicrowaves\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Microwaves and Microwave astronomy\n\nastronomy specifically focused at the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is microwave astronomy.\n\nMicrowaves, a subset of radio waves, have wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter, or equivalently, with frequencies between 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz.[84] This broad definition includes both UHF and Extremely high frequency (EHF) (millimeter waves), and various sources use different boundaries.[85] In all cases, microwave includes the entire super high frequency (SHF) band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1 GHz (30 cm), and the upper around 100 GHz (3 mm).\n\nRadars\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Radars and Radar astronomy\n\nRadar astronomy is used to detect and study astronomical objects that reflect radio rays.\n\n\"The advantages of radar in planetary astronomy result from (1) the observer's control of all the attributes of the coherent signal used to illuminate the target, especially the wave form's time/frequency modulation and polarization; (2) the ability of radar to resolve objects spatially via measurements of the distribution of echo power in time delay and Doppler frequency; (3) the pronounced degree to which delay-Doppler measurements constrain orbits and spin vectors; and (4) centimeter-to-meter wavelengths, which easily penetrate optically opaque planetary clouds and cometary comae, permit investigation of near-surface macrostructure and bulk density, and are sensitive to high concentrations of metal or, in certain situations, ice.\"[86]\n\nRadios\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Radios and Radio astronomy\n\nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies from 300 [Gigahertz] GHz to as low as 3 [kilohertz] kHz, and corresponding wavelengths from 1 millimeter to 100 kilometers.\n\nSeveral satellites have served as observatories for radio waves and specifically for microwaves. The Radio Astronomy Explorer (RAE) 1 is launched into orbit on July 4, 1968, around Earth, while the [Explorer 49] RAE 2 is launched on June 10, 1973, around the Moon.\n\nThe COBE is launched into Earth orbit on November 18, 1989. The WMAP is launched on June 30, 2001, into orbit at the [Lissajous orbit] Lagrange 2 location. Both satellites have aboard detectors designed to perform microwave astronomy, as these are limited to only the microwave band.\n\nGravitationals\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Gravitationals and Gravitational astronomy\n\nGravitational radiation appears to be cylindrical waves of radiation produced by relativistic, undulatory gravitational fields in Euclidean space.[87]\n\nInteraction Mediator Relative Magnitude Behavior Range Strong interaction gluon 1038 1 10−15 m Electromagnetic interaction photon 1036 1/r2 universal Weak interaction W and Z bosons 1025 1/r5 to 1/r7 10−16 m Gravitational interaction photon or graviton ? 10 1/r2 universal\n\nAs the gravitational interaction is 10-36 that of the electromagnetic interaction to produce gravitational radiation requires a massive oscillator.\n\nAt right are the results from the first gravitational radiation detection. The images show the radiation signals received by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) instruments at Hanford, Washington (left) and Livingston, Louisiana (right) and comparisons of these signals to the signals expected due to a black hole merger event.\n\nThe wavelength of the gravitational waves is given by for example: 3 x 108 m‧s-1/400 Hz = 750,000 m, which is way longer than radio waves but expected for such a weak oscillator. 35 Hz corresponds to 8,600,000 m.\n\nLIGO operates two detectors located 3000 km (1800 miles) apart: One in eastern Washington near Hanford, and the other near Livingston, Louisiana. The photo on the left shows the Livingston detector.\n\n\"According to general relativity, a pair of black holes orbiting around each other lose energy through the emission of gravitational waves, causing them to gradually approach each other over billions of years, and then much more quickly in the final minutes. During the final fraction of a second, the two black holes collide at nearly half the speed of light and form a single, more massive black hole, converting a portion of the combined black holes' mass to energy, according to Einstein's formula E=mc2. This energy is emitted as a final strong burst of gravitational waves. These are the gravitational waves that LIGO observed.\"[88]\n\n\"LIGO’s twin interferometers bounce laser beams between mirrors at the opposite ends of 4-kilometre-long vacuum pipes that are set perpendicularly to each other. A gravitational wave passing through will alter the length of one of the arms, causing the laser beams to shift slightly out of sync.\"[89]\n\nLater detection confirmed the fusion of two massive stellar-sized objects, a binary neutron star merger.[90]\n\n\"According to Einstein's field equations, photon matter subject to quadruple oscillations is a source of gravitational waves.\"[91]\n\n\"In this work, we present a solution to the first stage of a new two-stage global treatment of the vacuum binary black hole problem [1, 2]. The approach, based upon characteristic evolution, has been carried out in the regime of Schwarzschild perturbations where advanced and retarded solutions of the linearized problem can be rigorously identified [3]. Computational experiments are necessary to study the applicability of the approach to the nonlinear regime. From a time-reversed viewpoint, this first stage is equivalent to the determination of the outgoing radiation emitted from the fission of a white hole in the absence of ingoing radiation. This provides the physically correct “retarded” waveform for a white hole fission, were such events to occur in the universe. Although there is no standard astrophysical mechanism for producing white holes from a nonsingular matter distribution, white holes of primordial or quantum gravitational origin cannot be ruled out.\"[92]\n\n\"This fission problem has a simpler formulation as a characteristic initial value problem than the black hole merger problem. The boundary of the (conformally compactified) exterior spacetime contains two null hypersurfaces where boundary conditions must be satisfied: past null infinity I−, where the incoming radiation must vanish, and the white hole event horizon H−, which must describe a white hole, which is initially in equilibrium with no ingoing radiation and then distorts and ultimately fissions into two white holes with the emission of outgoing gravitational waves.\"[92]\n\nAn almost identical signal could originate from a comparable much more massive neutron star fission.\n\n\"This is an exciting time to study gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology. Through challenging cosmic microwave background (CMB) and supernovae observations cosmology has been turned on its head. Gravitational radiation astronomy should be the next contributor to this revolution in astrophysics and cosmology.\"[93]\n\nSuperluminals\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Superluminals and Superluminal astronomy\n\nSuperluminal refers to the propagation of information or matter faster than the speed of light. Under the special theory of relativity, a particle (that has [mass in special relativity] rest mass) with subluminal velocity needs infinite energy to accelerate to the speed of light, although special relativity does not forbid the existence of particles that travel faster than light at all times (tachyons).\n\nOn the other hand, what some physicists refer to as \"apparent\" or \"effective\" FTL[94][95][96][97] depends on the hypothesis that unusually distorted regions of spacetime might permit matter to reach distant locations in less time than light could in normal or undistorted spacetime. Although according to current theories matter is still required to travel subluminally with respect to the locally distorted spacetime region, apparent FTL is not excluded by general relativity.\n\nTachyonic γ rays have not been observed directly as of 2007.[98] \"The tachyonic spectral densities generated by ultra-relativistic electrons in uniform motion are fitted to the high-energy spectra of Galactic supernova remnants, such as RX J0852.0−4622 and the pulsar wind nebulae in G0.9+0.1 and MSH 15-52. ... Tachyonic cascade spectra are quite capable of generating the spectral curvature seen ...

There is the possibility that superluminal quanta just do not exist, the vacuum speed of light being the definitive upper bound. There is another explanation, the interaction of superluminal radiation with matter is very small, the quotient of tachyonic and electric fine-structure constants being q2/e2 ≈ 1.4 x 10-11 [5], and therefore superluminal quanta are hard to detect.\"[99]\n\n“Observed variations concerning the brightness distributions in four extragalactic radio sources were so rapid that the apparent transverse velocity of expansion is greater than the velocity of light.”[100]\n\nPlasma objects\n\nMain articles: Plasmas/Plasma objects and Plasma objects\n\n\"[A] medium-strength flare erupted from the sun on July 19, 2012.

A similar process involving ultraviolet light produces the visible light from fluorescent lamps.\"[102]\n\n\"The X-ray power detected from the Martian atmosphere is very small, amounting to only 4 megawatts, comparable to the X-ray power of about ten thousand medical X-ray machines.

It forms in the free atmosphere, or at the earth's surface, and includes frozen water lifted by the wind. Hydrometeors which can cause a surface visibility reduction, generally fall into one of the following two categories:\n\nPrecipitation. Precipitation includes all forms of water particles, both liquid and solid, which fall from the atmosphere and reach the ground; these include: liquid precipitation (drizzle and rain), freezing precipitation (freezing drizzle and freezing rain), and solid (frozen) precipitation (ice pellets, hail, snow, snow pellets, snow grains, and ice crystals).\n\nSuspended (Liquid or Solid) Water Particles. Liquid or solid water particles that form and remain suspended in the air (damp haze, cloud, fog, ice fog, and mist), as well as liquid or solid water particles that are lifted by the wind from the earth’s surface (drifting snow, blowing snow, blowing spray) cause restrictions to visibility. One of the more unusual causes of reduced visibility due to suspended water/ice particles is whiteout, while the most common cause is fog.\"[103]\n\nRocky objects\n\nMain article: Rocks/Rocky objects\n\nSin-Kamen (Синь-Камень, in Russian literally – Blue Stone, or Blue Rock) is a type of pagan sacred stones, widespread in Russia, in areas historically inhabited by both Eastern Slavic (Russian), and Uralic tribes (Merya, Muroma[104]).\n\nWhile in the majority of cases, the stones belonging to the Blue Stones type, have a black, or dark gray color, this particular stone [in the image] does indeed look dark blue, when wet.[105]\n\n\"Several types of rock surface materials can be recognized at the two sites [Viking Lander 1 and Viking Lander 2]; dark, relatively 'blue' rock surfaces are probably minimally weathered igneous rock, whereas bright rock surfaces, with a green/(blue + red) ratio higher than that of any other surface material, are interpreted as a weathering product formed in situ on the rock.\"[106]\n\nAt second right is an approximately natural color image of the asteroid 243 Ida. \"There are brighter areas, appearing bluish in the picture, around craters on the upper left end of Ida, around the small bright crater near the center of the asteroid, and near the upper right-hand edge (the limb).

Indeed, because of the nebula's shape and the measured velocity of the gas, in excess of 200 miles per second, astronomers believe that the description as a super-super-sonic jet exhaust is quite apt. Ground-based studies have shown that the nebula's size increases with time, suggesting that the stellar outburst that formed the lobes occurred just 1,200 years ago.\"[113]\n\nOxygens\n\nMain articles: Chemicals/Oxygens and Oxygens\n\n\"Electron temperatures are generally derived from the ratio of auroral to nebular lines in [O III] or [N II].\"[114] \"[B]ecause of the proximity of strong night-sky lines at λ4358 and λλ5770, 5791, the auroral lines of [O III] λ4363 and [N II] λ5755 are often contaminated.\"[114]\n\nFluorines\n\nMain articles: Chemicals/Fluorines and Fluorines\n\n\"Fluorine abundances for red giants of type K, Ba, M, MS, S, SC,N, and J [may be] obtained from the [infrared] rotation-vibration lines of the molecule HF.

It is rare, but is found in high-grade metamorphic rocks on Madagascar. Some presolar grains in primitive meteorites consist of hibonite. Hibonite also is a common mineral in the Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in some chondrite chondritic meteorites. Hibonite is closely related to hibonite-Fe (IMA 2009-027, ((Fe,Mg)Al12O19)) an alteration mineral from the Allende meteorite.[116] [Hibonite] is blue [perhaps like the image at left] in meteorite occurrence.\n\nAlloys\n\nMain articles: Chemicals/Alloys and Alloys\n\n\"Grain size varies from 98 to 530 lm with an average of *150 lm.

In general, if a particle scatters light in such a way that it does not hold the energy for any length of time but simply defects it without change of wave-length, then the polarization of the deflected light has the following characteristics: (a) its plane of polarization is usually perpendicular to or, more rarely, parallel to the plane formed by the incident and the scattered rays; and (b) the amount of polarization is inversely correlated with the size of the particles. When the scattering particles are of the order of size of a few hundred molecules or smaller we have what is usually known as Rayleigh scattering. Here the polarization reaches very large values, as is evidenced by our own blue atmosphere, which gives values up to 70 per cent.\"[118]\n\nMaterials\n\nMain articles: Chemicals/Materials and Materials\n\n\"The depth of the absorption bands and the continuum reflectance of [Kuiper Belt Object] 1996 TO66 suggest the presence of a black- to slightly blue-colored, spectrally featureless particulate material as a minority component mixed with the water ice.\"[119]\n\nMeteorites\n\nMain articles: Rocks/Meteorites and Meteorites\n\nDef. a metallic or stony object that is the remains of a meteor is called a meteorite.\n\nWidmanstätten patterns, also called Thomson structures, are unique figures of long nickel-iron crystals, found in the octahedrite iron meteorites and some pallasite]]s.

Mauna Kea last erupted 4,000 to 6,000 years ago ~7,000 b2k. The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light to radio, and comprise the largest such facility in the world.\n\nSpectroscopy\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Spectroscopy and Spectroscopy\n\nAstronomical spectroscopy is the technique of spectroscopy used in astronomy. The object of study is the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which radiates from stars and other celestial objects. Spectroscopy can be used to derive many properties of distant stars and galaxies, such as their chemical composition, but also their motion by Doppler shift measurements.\n\nTemporal, spatial, and spectral distributions of radiation are the focus of the science of spectroscopy as applied to astronomy.\n\n\"NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has detected the building blocks of life in the distant universe, albeit in a violent milieu. Training its powerful infrared eye on a faint object located at a distance of 3.2 billion light-years (inset [in the image on the right]), Spitzer has observed the presence of water and organic molecules in the galaxy IRAS F00183-7111. With an active galactic nucleus, this is one of the most luminous galaxies in the universe, rivaling the energy output of a quasar. Because it is heavily obscured by dust, most of its luminosity is radiated at infrared wavelengths.\"[121]\n\n\"The infrared spectrograph instrument onboard Spitzer breaks light into its constituent colors, much as a prism does for visible light. The image shows a low-resolution spectrum of the galaxy obtained by the spectrograph at wavelengths between 4 and 20 microns. Spectra are graphical representations of a celestial object's unique blend of light. Characteristic patterns, or fingerprints, within the spectra allow astronomers to identify the object's chemical composition and to determine such physical properties as temperature and density.\"[121]\n\n\"The broad depression in the center of the spectrum denotes the presence of silicates (chemically similar to beach sand) in the galaxy. An emission peak (red) within the bottom of the trough is the chemical signature for molecular hydrogen. The hydrocarbons (orange) are organic molecules comprised of carbon and hydrogen, two of the most common elements on Earth. Since it has taken more than three billion years for the light from the galaxy to reach Earth, it is intriguing to note the presence of organics in a distant galaxy at a time when life is thought to have started forming on our home planet.\"[121]\n\n\"Additional features in the spectrum reveal the presence of water ice (blue), carbon dioxide ice (green) and carbon monoxide (purple) in both gas and solid forms. The magenta peak corresponds to singly ionized neon gas, a spectral line often used by astronomers as a diagnostic of star formation rates in distant galaxies.\"[121]\n\nSpectrometers\n\nMain articles: Radiation astronomy/Spectrometers and Spectrometers\n\nDef. a visual representation of the spectrum of a celestial body's radiation is called a spectrogram.\n\nDef. a machine for recording spectra, producing spectrograms is called a spectrograph.\n\nDef. an optical instrument for measuring the absorption of light by chemical substances; typically it will plot a graph of absorption versus wavelength or frequency, and the patterns produced are used to identify the substances present, and their internal structure is called a spectrometer.\n\nDef. the measurement of the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, especially any of several techniques used to analyze the structure of molecules; the measurement of spectra of things other than radiation, such as the masses of molecules and their breakdown products is called spectrometry.\n\nDef. the scientific study of spectra often using spectrometers is called spectroscopy.\n\nPlanetary astronomy\n\n\"Energetic photons, ions and electrons from the solar wind, together with galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, constantly bombard surfaces of planets, planetary satellites, dust particles, comets and asteroids.\"[122] \"[I]nterplanetary space ... is a stormy and sometimes very violent environment permeated by energetic particles and radiation constantly emanating from the Sun.\"[122]\n\nEach of the astronomical objects that constitute planetary science emits, reflects, or fluoresces radiation that is observed and analyzed.\n\n\"The spectrum of gaseous methane at 77 K in the 1.1-2.6 µm region [is] a benchmark for planetary astronomy\".[123]\n\nSun\n\nMain articles: Stars/Sun and Sun (star)\n\nBut truly, the now famous sun set at the peak where you will witness the panorama of rolling green hills and also a glimpse of Arabian sea and the bright orange sun going down the hills might force one to contemplate on the nature and its complex beauty. And to witness the same sun rise above the foggy and misty hills and over a blanket of silver clouds the next early morning would be the perfect way to start a day.\n\nGeography\n\nMain articles: Locations/Geography and Geography\n\nHigh Energy Stereoscopic System or H.E.S.S. is a next-generation system of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) for the investigation of cosmic gamma rays in the 100 GeV and TeV energy range. The acronym was chosen in honour of Victor Hess, who was the first to observe cosmic rays.\n\nThe name also emphasizes two main features of the currently-operating installation, namely the simultaneous observation of air showers with several telescopes, under different viewing angles, and the combination of telescopes to a large system to increase the effective detection area for gamma rays. H.E.S.S. permits the exploration of gamma-ray sources with intensities at a level of a few thousandth parts of the flux of the Crab Nebula.\n\nH.E.S.S. is located on the Cranz family farm, Göllschau, in Namibia, near the Gamsberg, an area well known for its excellent optical quality. The first of the four telescopes of Phase I of the H.E.S.S. project went into operation in Summer 2002; all four were operational in December 2003.\n\nThe ideal submillimetre observing site is dry, cool, has stable weather conditions and is away from urban population centres. There are only a handful of such sites identified, they include [Mauna Kea Observatory] Mauna Kea (Hawaii, USA), the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory on the Atacama Plateau (Chile), the South Pole, and Hanla (India). Comparisons show that all four sites are excellent for submillimetre astronomy, and of these sites Mauna Kea is the most established and arguably the most accessible. The Llano de Chajnantor Observatory site hosts the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), the largest submillimetre telescope operating in the southern hemisphere, and the world's largest ground based astronomy project, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), an interferometer for submillimetre wavelength observations made of 54 12-metre and 12 7-metre radio telescopes. The Submillimeter Array (SMA) is another interferometer, located at Mauna Kea, consisting of eight 6-metre diameter radio telescopes. The largest existing submillimetre telescope, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, is also located on Mauna Kea.\n\nRecent history\n\nMain articles: History/Recent and Recent history\n\nThe recent history period dates from around 1,000 b2k to present.\n\nThe Hominidae have apparently been on Earth for around seven million years, at least somewhere in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Fortunately and deliberately, many of these have worked out ways to record knowledge about the objects or entities in the sky observed by the radiation they produce.\n\n\"Mere \"star ordering\" is not \"astronomy\", so far as the modern usage of the term implies, regardless of the word's etymology\".[124]\n\nThe modern scientific discipline of astronomy focuses on reproducibility and physical theory to explain and describe observations. Many ancient observers produced remarkably reproducible calendars such as the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar which apparently goes from August 11, 3114 [Common era] BCE [5114 b2k], to October 13, 4772 [2772 a2k], and beyond.\n\nFrom X-ray astronomy: \"The beginning of the search for X-ray sources above the Earth's atmosphere is August 5, 1948, at 12:07 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).[125][126] As part of Project Hermes a US Army (formerly German) V-2 rocket number 43 is launched from White Sands Proving Grounds, launch complex (LC) 33, to an altitude of 166 km.[126] This is \"the first detection of solar X-rays.\"[127]\"\n\nInfrared astronomy began in the 1830s, a few decades after the discovery of infrared light by William Herschel in 1800.\n\nThe initial detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was made in the 1930s, when Karl Jansky observed radiation coming from the Milky Way.\n\nAstromathematics\n\nIn astrophysics, x is usually a ratio of frequencies, that is, the frequency over a critical frequency (critical frequency is the frequency at which most synchrotron radiation is radiated). This is needed when calculating the spectra for different types of synchrotron emission. It takes a spectrum of electrons (or any charged particle) generated by a separate process (such as a power law distribution of electrons and positrons from a constant injection spectrum) and converts this to the spectrum of photons generated by the input electrons/positrons.\n\nMathematics is involved in many ways to help describe the entities or objects used to model radiation astronomy results.\n\nUsually, in mathematical astronomy, a number is associated with a dimension or aspect of an entity. For example, the Earth is 1.50 x 108 km on average from the Sun. Kilometer (km) is a dimension and 1.50 x 108 is a number.\n\nDef. the study of the dimensions of quantities; used to obtain information about large complex systems, and as a means of checking equations is called dimensional analysis.\n\nPhysics\n\nThe physics of radiation astronomy consists of the emission of radiation by a source and the detection of this radiation by devices available to the astronomer. Astrophysics at its simplest is the application of laboratory physics, i.e., physics demonstrated in a laboratory and described with logical laws, to natural astronomical entities. This is done to understand these astronomical entities, their origin, history, and current constitution.\n\nThe electron volt (eV) is a unit that will be useful later.\n\nThe eV is the energy gained by an electron in passing through a potential difference of one volt. Since the charge on an electron is 1.60218 x 10-19 Coulombs, an eV is 1.60218 x 10-19 J. A keV is 1000 eV and a MeV is 1000 keV).\n\nA photon with an energy of 1eV has a frequency of 1 eV/h = 2.41799 x 1014 Hz or about 242 THz and a wavelength of c.h/1 eV = 1.23984 x 10-6 m or about 1,240 nm or 12,400 Å. That would put the photon in the infrared range. In practice, photon energies are seldom stated for such long wavelengths.\n\nSciences\n\nMain article: Sciences\n\nAn astronomical X-ray source catalog or catalogue is a list or tabulation of astronomical objects that are X-ray sources, typically grouped together because they share a common type, morphology, origin, means of detection, or method of discovery. Astronomical X-ray source catalogs are usually the result of an astronomical survey of some kind, often performed using an X-ray astronomical observatory in orbit around Earth.\n\n\"Distribution and Variability of Cosmic X-Ray Sources\", published on April 1, 1967, describes 35 astronomical X-ray sources detected by sounding rocket launched with an X-ray detector on board by the X-ray astronomy group at the Naval Research Laboratory in the United States.[128]\n\n\"The fourth Uhuru catalog of X-ray sources\", contains 339 sources observed over the entire active period of the satellite, but not necessarily the earlier designation.[129] It does not contain actual dates of observation for any sources. Sources detected during the final observation period from August 27, 1973, to January 12, 1974, are prefixed with \"4U\".\n\n\"The Ariel V /3 A/ catalogue of X-ray sources. II - Sources at high galactic latitude |b| > 10°\", contains sources with high galactic latitudes and includes some sources observed by HEAO 1, Einstein, OSO 7, SAS 3, Uhuru, and earlier, mainly rocket, observations.[130]\n\nTechnology\n\nMain article: Technology\n\nIn an X-ray tube, electrons are accelerated in a vacuum by an electric field and shot into a piece of metal called the \"target\". X-rays are emitted as the electrons slow down (decelerate) in the metal. The output spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum of X-rays, with additional sharp peaks at certain energies (see graph on right). The continuous spectrum is due to bremsstrahlung, while the sharp peaks are characteristic X-rays associated with the atoms in the target. For this reason, bremsstrahlung in this context is also called continuous X-rays.[131]\n\nA synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator originating from the cyclotron in which the guiding magnetic field (bending the particles into a closed path) is time-dependent, being synchronized to a particle beam of increasing kinetic energy. The synchrotron is one of the first accelerator concepts that enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since bending, beam focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. Unlike in a cyclotron, synchrotrons are unable to accelerate particles from zero kinetic energy; one of the obvious reasons for this is that its closed particle path would be cut by a device that emits particles. Thus, schemes were developed to inject pre-accelerated particle beams into a synchrotron. The pre-acceleration can be realized by a chain of other accelerator structures like a linac, a microtron or another synchrotron; all of these in turn need to be fed by a particle source comprising a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator.\n\nDetectors\n\nRadiation detectors provide a signal that is converted to an electric current. The device is designed so that the current provided is proportional to the characteristics of the incident radiation.\n\nThere are detectors that provide a change in substance as the signal and these may be automated to provide an electric current or quantified proportional to the amount of new substance.\n\nSatellites\n\nRadiation satellites may be designed and built for detection in one particular radiation astronomy or for many. Some have been built for more than one purpose or for a different purpose entirely.\n\nTo place sensors (or detectors) above the Earth’s atmosphere is often a necessity for radiation astronomy. “The sensors at once lose the basic advantage of both radio and optical telescopes, a rigid, well-surveyed foundation upon a well-behaved earth.”[132] “The source locations, therefore, reflect uncertainties in both the sensor data and in vehicle aspect.”[132]\n\nTelescopes\n\nA radiation telescope is an instrument designed to collect and focus radiation so as to make distant sources appear nearer.\n\nHypotheses\n\nMain article: Hypotheses\n\nAlmost every naturally occurring subatomic particle may be used in astronomy to provide information on astronomical entities, sources, or objects.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe content on this page was first contributed by: Henry A.
