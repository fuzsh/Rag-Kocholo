READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU INVEST OR SEND MONEY. MARKET RECAP It took over 100 interest-rate cuts by central banks around the world to defuse the powder keg that characterized global equity markets 12 months ago. Those easings sparked a dramatic worldwide recovery and, in a few cases - particularly in the U.S. - were so powerful that some of the easings needed to be reversed. The bottom line, however, is that the world was a much better place to invest in at the conclusion of the 12 months ending October 31, 1999, than it was at the beginning of the period. EUROPE: European markets offered mixed results over the past 12 months. In that time, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Index returned 12.79%. The U.K. posted the most impressive market returns, due in large part to the strength of the vibrant telecommunications industry. Italy and Germany, meanwhile, lagged behind, mostly due to fears of higher interest rates. The weak performance of the euro - the new single currency of 11 European nations that was introduced January 1, 1999 - didn't help matters. An additional detriment was the subpar performance of many of Europe's largest pharmaceutical companies, which suffered due to non-compelling product introductions and slow revenue growth. On a positive note, cross-border consolidation played a significant role across the European corporate landscape, as merger, acquisition and takeover bid announcements were almost daily occurrences. EMERGING MARKETS: A year ago, the emerging markets' outlook was bleak. Currency problems were the norm for several regions, and market volatility reigned supreme. In the fall of 1999, however, the markets told a different story. Over the past 12 months, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Free Index returned 44.63%. Several factors contributed to this about-face, including lower interest rates and favorable export and trade data. Sentiment shifts were evident in markets such as Singapore, Thailand and especially India, where the strong performance of technology stocks helped propel that market to phenomenal returns. Latin America was also a comeback story, as Brazil rebounded nicely from it currency devaluation in January. Mexico, however, slipped over the past several months due to concerns about interest rates and fears of a potentially weaker peso. JAPAN AND THE FAR EAST: For overseas investors, Japan was the place to be for the 12-month period that ended October 31, 1999.

For the period, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Japan Index returned 58.40% and Japan's TOPIX Index returned 69.97%. Other Asian markets also received a vicarious boost from Japan: Technology-driven markets such as South Korea and Taiwan performed well, as worldwide demand for personal computers translated into positive gains for semiconductor manufacturers. U.S. AND CANADA: The U.S. equity market produced solid returns for the 12 months ending October 31, 1999. The Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 26.84%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index - a popular gauge of U.S. stock market performance - returned 25.67%. Early on, the Federal Reserve Board tried to stabilize the impact of shaky global markets on the U.S. by lowering interest rates. In response, the Dow hit the 10,000 level for the first time in March. Late in the second quarter, however, concerns over an overheating U.S. economy and global market recoveries triggered inflation fears. In June and again in August, the Fed raised rates and the market sold off throughout the third quarter as investors anticipated additional increases. In the end, technology stocks were the clear winners as the NASDAQ Index reeled off a healthy 67.98% return. While Canadian equity markets didn't get nearly the attention of their neighbors to the south, their performance was nearly as loud, as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) 300 returned 24.49%. BONDS: With few exceptions, bond performance either fell flat or dropped into negative territory for the 12-month period. Concerns about inflation, higher interest rates and the solid performance of world equity markets posed the major threats to fixed-income instruments. For the period, the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index - a widely followed measure of taxable bond performance - posted a total return of 0.53%. U.S. Treasuries gave back all of their flight-to-quality gains - and then some - captured during the fall of 1998, as the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Government Index fell 6.10%. Meanwhile, the Lehman Brothers Corporate Bond Index returned 0.61%, and the Salomon Brothers Non-U.S. World Government Bond Index fell 2.96%. There were a few bright spots, however. The high-yield market, as measured by the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index, returned 5.61% during the 12-month period, while the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus returned 19.98%. GLOBAL BALANCED PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE There are several ways to evaluate a fund's historical performance. You can look at the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the fund's dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value).

For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050. You can compare the fund's returns to the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index - a market capitalization-weighted index that is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets throughout the world. As of October 31, 1999, the index included over 1300 equity securities of companies domiciled in 22 countries. You can also compare the fund's returns to the performance of the Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index - a market value-weighted index of debt issues traded in 14 world government bond markets. To measure how the fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the global flexible portfolio funds average, which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper Inc. The past one year average represents a peer group of 105 mutual funds. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

As the chart shows, by October 31, 1999, the value of the investment would have grown to $20,557 - a 105.57% increase on the initial investment. For comparison, look at how both the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index and Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index did over the same period. With dividends and capital gains, if any, reinvested, the same $10,000 investment in the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index would have grown to $27,803 - a 178.03% increase and the Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index would have grown to $15,449 - a 54.49% increase. UNDERSTANDING PERFORMANCE Many markets around the globe offer the potential for significant growth over time; however, investing in foreign markets means assuming greater risks than investing in the United States. Factors like changes in a country's financial markets, its local political and economic climate, and the fluctuating value of its currency create these risks. For these reasons an international fund's performance may be more volatile than a fund that invests exclusively in the United States. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. (checkmark) GLOBAL BALANCED FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW An interview with Richard Mace, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Global Balanced Fund Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM, RICK? A. The fund recently switched its fiscal year-end from July 31 to October 31. As such, this discussion only reflects performance for a three-month period - from July 31, 1999, through October 31, 1999. During that time, the fund returned 4.57%. The fund typically compares its performance to three measures: a bond index, an equity index and a peer group of competitor funds. The fund topped its bond-related benchmark - the Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index - which returned 1.98% during the same time period. The fund's equity-oriented benchmark - the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index - returned 3.95%. The global flexible portfolios average - as tracked by Lipper Inc. - returned 2.16%. Q. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE KEY FACTORS BEHIND THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE? A. Much of the fund's positive performance can be traced to good representation in the rebounding Japanese market. Our research team was able to identify several worthwhile opportunities there, including telephone utilities stocks such as Hikari Tsushin and NTT Mobile Communication Network. Both of these investments were inexpensive relative to their global competitors and also appeared to be potential consolidation candidates. Investors throughout the world also were drawn to several Japanese Internet-related and business software providers. As such, the fund's positions in Softbank, Trend Micro, Fujitsu Support & Service and Hitachi Information Systems benefited. At the end of the period, Japanese stocks accounted for approximately 11% of the fund's total investments. Telecommunications stocks also performed well, as wireless demand remained high. Q. WHAT TYPES OF CHANGES DID YOU MAKE TO THE FUND'S EQUITY SUBPORTFOLIO, AND HOW DID THIS PORTION OF THE FUND PERFORM? A. The biggest adjustment I made was to reduce the fund's equity position from just under 63% three months ago to around 60% at the close of the period. This was done mainly to bring the fund's equity exposure more in line with the Morgan Stanley index. In terms of individual stock performance, the fund's best performers were the Japanese investments I mentioned. On the flip side, several U.S. technology-related stocks detracted from performance during the period, mostly due to weak earnings and revenue growth outlooks. These included computer services provider Unisys, as well as Hewlett-Packard, the second-largest computer builder in the U.S. Another significant laggard was supermarket chain Safeway, which failed to meet third-quarter profit forecasts due to rising costs and declining sales. Q. HOW DID THE FUND'S BOND INVESTMENTS PERFORM DURING THE PERIOD? A. Not as well as I would have liked. The fund had virtually no bond positions in Japan, which turned out to be the best-performing market in local currency terms. I avoided Japanese bonds for several reasons. First, in allocating fund assets, I focus on how bonds are valued relative to equities in each country by comparing the cash flow yield on equities to the yield on bonds. In Japan, bonds tend to offer very low yields, and these yields can be easily erased by a moderate weakening of the yen. The fact that Japanese bonds reversed this trend during the period hurt the fund, particularly relative to the Salomon Brothers benchmark. Globally, fears of higher interest rates sent several bond markets - including those in the U.K., France, Germany and the U.S. - downward. Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK? A. I think we'll see more consolidation and cross-border merger activity throughout the world. In Europe, this trend has continued as the new single currency - the euro - has made it easier for companies within the same industry to join forces. I'm optimistic that the progress we've seen in Japan also will continue. Companies there have followed in the footsteps of their American counterparts in terms of eliminating unprofitable businesses and looking for ways to restructure internally.

You can look at the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the fund's dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value). CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1994 PAST 1 YEAR PAST 5 YEARS PAST 10 YEARS FIDELITY INTL GROWTH & INCOME 36.51% 80.39% 168.27% MSCI EAFE 23.29% 56.31% 91.41% International Funds Average 25.53% 58.85% 152.13% CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms over a set period - in this case, one year, five years or 10 years. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050. You can compare the fund's returns to the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) Index - a market capitalization-weighted index that is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets outside the United States and Canada. As of October 31, 1999, the index included over 900 equity securities of countries domiciled in 20 countries. To measure how the fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the international funds average, which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper Inc. The past one year average represents a peer group of 589 mutual funds. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

As the chart shows, by October 31, 1999, the value of the investment would have grown to $26,827 - a 168.27% increase on the initial investment. For comparison, look at how both the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE Index did over the same period. With dividends and capital gains, if any, reinvested in each, the same $10,000 would have grown to $19,141 - a 91.41% increase. UNDERSTANDING PERFORMANCE Many markets around the globe offer the potential for significant growth over time; however, investing in foreign markets means assuming greater risks than investing in the United States. Factors like changes in a country's financial markets, its local political and economic climate, and the fluctuating value of its currency create these risks. For these reasons an international fund's performance may be more volatile than a fund that invests exclusively in the United States. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. (checkmark) INTERNATIONAL GROWTH & INCOME FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW An interview with Bill Bower, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity International Growth & Income Fund Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM, BILL? A. The fund performed very well. For the 12-month period that ended October 31, 1999, the fund posted a total return of 36.51%. In comparison, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) Index returned 23.29%. The fund also compares its performance against the international funds average, tracked by Lipper Inc., which returned 25.53% during the same period. Q. WHAT FACTORS LED TO THE FUND'S STRONG PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE INDEX AND ITS LIPPER PEER GROUP? A. Most of the fund's favorable performance can be attributed to strong stock selection within the recovering Japanese market. While the fund remained marginally underweighted in Japanese securities versus the EAFE index, the stocks we picked performed exceptionally well. Specifically, the fund's holdings in Japanese telecommunications, business services, specialty finance companies and electronic components posted strong gains as industry consolidation and improving global economies boosted sales. With the exception of Telecom Italia, European telephone companies and telecommunications equipment manufacturers also were particularly positive contributors as stock prices were lifted by continued accelerating earnings forecasts and a robust mergers-and-acquisitions environment. Q. JAPAN REPLACED THE U.K. AS THE FUND'S LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION, INCREASING FROM APPROXIMATELY 18% OF THE FUND'S NET ASSETS SIX MONTHS AGO TO ROUGHLY 26% AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. WHAT FACTORS ACCOUNTED FOR THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE? A. My views regarding Japanese banks and the general market became increasingly positive during the period because many companies were beating earnings estimates and becoming more serious about restructuring. Following the announcement of a three-way bank merger between Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan, I became more enthusiastic about the prospects for growth in the Japanese market. These mergers, which were coordinated by the Japanese government, signaled a critical and necessary change in the way Japanese companies and the government were approaching corporate restructuring and reforms. Q. DID YOU MAKE ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE PORTFOLIO DURING THE PERIOD? WHAT TYPES OF STOCKS AND INDUSTRIES DID YOU FOCUS ON? A. I didn't make many significant changes. However, as some of the fund's Japanese holdings blew through their price targets, I started to look for alternatives within the Japanese market and other regions of the world. While Japan will probably remain the fund's largest geographical weighting in the short term, some of the areas I looked at were the European mid-cap growth stocks, which appeared to be undervalued relative to large-cap stocks. An example of mid-cap stock I purchased during the period was Dutch software company Epchos, which, in my opinions was undervalued relative to its earnings and sales growth outlook. Q. WHICH STOCKS PROVIDED THE STRONGEST RESULTS FOR THE FUND? A. Japanese and European telecommunications companies such as DDI Corp., Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) and Nokia were among the fund's top holdings and provided a significant boost to fund performance. As I mentioned earlier, telecommunications companies benefited from a robust mergers-and-acquisitions environment, favorable fundamental business outlooks and strong earnings momentum. Another strong contributor to performance was Toyoda Gosei, an auto parts manufacturer that is a major supplier to Toyota Motor. Its shares rallied during the period as auto sales picked up and the company was viewed as undervalued relative to its competition. Q. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT STRATEGIES AND STOCKS THAT WORKED WELL FOR THE FUND. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME HOLDINGS THAT HURT PERFORMANCE . . . A. The fund's overweighted position in Telecom Italia detracted from relative performance after it was taken over by Technost. Later in the period, Technost made an offer to buy out Telecom Italia, offering no premium to the underlying market value, resulting in further weakness in the share price. Another disappointment for the fund was Arcadia Group. The British retailer suffered from a difficult pricing environment that we thought would improve during the period, but remained weak. Shares of Rentokil also were punished after the British pest control and cleaning services firm missed earnings estimates and experienced slower sales growth. The fund's holdings in Nestle and Unilever also hurt performance due to slower-than-expected earnings growth for these companies and the food sector overall. Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, BILL? A. While the short-term global market environment poses a number of risks due to Year 2000 (Y2K) concerns and uncertainty around the interest-rate outlook in the U.S. and Europe, I don't run the fund based on potential short-term events. Consequently, I don't anticipate making major changes to the portfolio at this time. In addition, due to some recent changes I made to the portfolio and the asset allocation shifts we've already discussed, I feel the fund is well-positioned to benefit from the anticipated ongoing recovery in the Japanese market, yet is still protected from potential weakness in certain sectors. For example, I recently reduced the fund's exposure to Japanese specialty-finance companies, or non-bank lenders, because I felt their valuations were getting expensive and Japanese banks were beginning to encroach upon their business. Another area I've been keeping a close eye on is Europe, especially the European banks, which have been hard hit due to interest-rate hikes by central banks. I've become less negative on European financial issues because I think the positives of low valuations, earnings improvement and industry consolidation outweigh the negatives of potentially higher interest rates.

BILL BOWER COMMENTS ON HIS INVESTMENT STYLE AND HOW IT SHAPES THE STRATEGY AND HOLDINGS OF THE FUND: \"The first things I ask when I look at a stock are: `Is this a good business? Is it stable? Is the company's cash flow growing?' Because of my focus on these areas, the fund's dividend yield is lower than similar overseas funds and the Morgan Stanley EAFE index. In other words, I'm a firm believer in a company's free cash-flow generation as a catalyst for growth; my focus on dividend yield is secondary. My investment style also is highly dependent upon fundamental and technical analysis of individual companies, industries and market trends. An example of this research is a recent study that my team of analysts and I completed, which investigated the correlation between stock performance and dividend yields of stocks that have made up the EAFE index over the past three years. Our results showed that if you invested solely on the basis of higher dividend yield, you would've significantly underperformed the market. Accordingly, the fund has concentrated more on companies with stable free cash flow, favorable growth outlooks and accelerating earnings versus stocks with merely high dividend yields. \"Another area I tend to focus on is the track record of corporate managements and what types of incentives they receive. This approach has subsequently led me to successful companies whose managements have a high level of stock ownership. Often, these companies tend to be younger businesses that have smaller stock capitalizations and whose management teams have a large stake in the success of their company. These are the types of companies that I believe have the best prospects to outperform the broader market over the long term. While these types of investments present interesting opportunities for the fund, this is not to say that there aren't any large-cap stocks that meet my investment criteria.

You can look at the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the fund's dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value). If Fidelity had not reimbursed certain fund expenses, the life of fund total returns would have been lower.

For example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050. You can compare the fund's returns to the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) Index - a market capitalization-weighted index that is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets outside the United States and Canada. As of October 31, 1999, the index included over 900 equity securities of companies domiciled in 20 countries. You can also compare the fund's returns to the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital International GDP-Weighted Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) Index - a gross domestic product weighted, unmanaged index of over 900 foreign stocks. To measure how the fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the international funds average, which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper Inc. The past one year average represents a peer group of 589 mutual funds. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.
