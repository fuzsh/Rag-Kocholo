        "text": "The building of Fundação José Saramag is noticeable for its unique facade that is covered with diamond-shaped stones. It was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake and restored after that. The inside of the house has undergone vast changes, but the original marble staircase and contrasting dark walls are still its highlights. During its history, the house has served various purposes, at one point being a warehouse for codfish. Since 2012, it houses the José Saramago Foundation. It is a private institution displaying work of this Portuguese writer, who received Nobel Prize in Literature in 1998.\n\nWrite a review\n\nYour review helps other people learn about great and less great museums.
