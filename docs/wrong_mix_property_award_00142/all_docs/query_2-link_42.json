        "text": "STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Guenter Grass, Germany's best-known writer of the post-World War II generation, won the 1999 Nobel Prize in literature today.\n\nThe announcement brought a smile from the 71-year-old author. ``I'm happy,'' he told journalists after emerging with his wife and dog from his house in Behlendorf in northern Germany.\n\nThe Swedish Academy cited Grass' first novel, ``The Tin Drum,'' published in 1959, for ushering in a new era for German literature.\n\n``Here he comes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: the victims, losers and lies that people wanted to forget because they had once believed in them. ...,'' the academy said.\n\n``It is not too audacious to assume that `The Tin Drum' will become one of the enduring literary works of the 20th century.''\n\nCombining naturalistic detail with fantastical images and events, Grass established his reputation with the ``The Tin Drum,'' ``Cat and Mouse'' and ``Dog Years,'' published between 1959 and 1963.\n\nCollectively known as The Danzig Trilogy, the novels captured the German reaction to the rise of Nazism, the horrors of war and the guilt that lingered in the aftermath of Adolf Hitler's regime.\n\nToday's announcement of the 1999 literature laureate was a break from tradition. The Swedish Academy usually names the winner on a Thursday in October. It did not say why the winner was announced sooner this year.\n\nThe academy, founded in 1786, has 18 members, although one spot is vacant and three members don't participate. Academy members, former recipients and a select group of literature and language professors and specialists in the field may suggest candidates.\n\nJose Saramago of Portugal won last year's Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nNobel Prize winners receive their prizes, this year worth $960,000, on Dec. 10."
