        "text": "Poetry\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nAlthough no literary documents belonging to the 12th century (the first century of Portugal’s history as a nation) have survived, there is evidence of the existence of an indigenous popular oral poetry in sung verse during the preceding centuries. A composition attributed to Alfonso X, a 13th-century king of Castile and Leon, is the earliest extant parallelistic song—a brief, repetitive lyrical poem marked by a wistful sadness that runs throughout Portuguese literature. Of the many later poems that survive, most belong to the major categories of cantigas de amor (“songs of love”; a male voice singing of problems of love), cantigas de amigo (“songs of the lover”; a male poet singing in a female voice to express a wide range of predicaments of love), and cantigas de escárnio e maldizer (“songs of mockery and vilification”). This body of lyrics shows the vitality of a school of poetry in Galician-Portuguese, an early dialect spoken in Galicia and the north of Portugal. Lyrics of this school were inspired by the sophisticated Provençal songs of the troubadours as well as anchored in the oral verse forms of popular tradition. This poetry reached its peak of creativity about 1240–80 under the patronage and with the direct participation of Alfonso X, although his father had begun to receive musicians and performers (trovadores and jograis) before this period. Under Alfonso X, the centre of this literary activity shifted from Galicia and the north of Portugal to Toledo (now in Spain), where it remained until his death. He was also the composer of the great majority of its texts.\n\nIn Portugal this poetic movement coincided with the reign (1248–79) of Afonso III. Dinis, his son, had a deep interest in literature and was considered the best poet of his age in the Iberian Peninsula. As king, Dinis founded in 1290 his country’s first university, at Lisbon. He encouraged translation into Portuguese of outstanding works from Castilian, Latin, and Arabic, and the musicians in his court enjoyed the most highly cultivated practice of this national poetics. In all, about 2,000 poems by some 200 poets of this period were preserved in three great cancioneiros (“songbooks”): the Cancioneiro da Ajuda, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana, and the Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti (now known as the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional). The first contains compositions that predate the death of Alfonso X in 1284; it was probably compiled in the late 13th century. The latter two cancioneiros include material from the 13th and 14th centuries; they are 14th-century copies that were made in Italy, probably from a 14th-century original. Modern editions resulted from the work of the 19th-century philologists and medievalists Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcelos, J.J. Nunes, and Teófilo Braga.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Few of these ballads can be dated earlier than the 15th century; they belong to a tradition of anonymous poetry kept alive by oral transmission, by which they were spread across Europe and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the late 15th century. The romanceiro experienced a late artificial flowering from known poets in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nProse\n\nReligious writings, brief annals of the early kings, moral tales, and books of descent formed the earliest Portuguese prose texts. The 14th-century Livro de linhagens (“Book of Genealogy”) of Pedro Afonso, count of Barcelos, constituted a landmark by going beyond genealogy to history and legend. The work contains short epic narratives, romances, and tales of adventure and fantasy. He was also responsible for the compilation in 1344 of the Crónica geral de Espanha (“General Chronicle of Spain”), of interest, within the peninsular tradition of the chronicle genre, for its original versions of well-known legends, such as that of Afonso Henriques, who (as Afonso I) was the first king of Portugal. Portuguese prose narrative also developed in the chivalric romance, for which Amadís de Gaula (14th century; Amadís of Gaul)—thought to have been written originally in Portuguese or Castilian—was a prototype.\n\nThe early popularity of subject matter based on Celtic tradition is attested in the five songs based on Breton lays with which the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional opens. The ideals of chivalry and the spirit of sentimental adventure associated with the knights of the Round Table strongly appealed to the Portuguese imagination: História dos Cavaleiros da Távola Redonda (“History of the Knights of the Round Table”) and the Demanda do Santo Graal (“Search for the Holy Grail”), adapted from the French, are the chief relics of the considerable writing in this genre."
