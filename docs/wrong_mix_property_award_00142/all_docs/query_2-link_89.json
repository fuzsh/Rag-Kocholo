        "text": "Tudástár\n\nWikipédia (magyar)\n\nWikipedia (angol)\n\nSnitt\n\n>\n\nHarold Bloom\n\nJosé de Sousa Saramago, GColSE ComSE GColCa (Portuguese: [ʒuˈzɛ ðɨ ˈsozɐ sɐɾɐˈmaɣu]; 16 November 1922 – 18 June 2010), was a Portuguese writer and recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony [with which he] continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality.\" His works, some of which can be seen as allegories, commonly present subversive perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the theopoetic human factor. In 2003 Harold Bloom described Saramago as \"the most gifted novelist alive in the world today\" and in 2010 said he considers Saramago to be \"a permanent part of the Western canon\", while James Wood praises \"the distinctive tone to his fiction because he narrates his novels as if he were someone both wise and ignorant.\"\n\nPilar del Río\n\nJosé Saramago: The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\n\nSaramago was a founding member of the National Front for the Defense of Culture in Lisbon in 1992.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly and middle life\n\nSaramago was born in 1922 into a family of very poor landless peasants in Azinhaga, Portugal, a small village in Ribatejo Province, some one hundred kilometres northeast of Lisbon. His parents were José de Sousa and Maria da Piedade. \"Saramago\", the Portuguese word for Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish), was the insulting nickname given to his father, and was accidentally incorporated into his name by the village clerk upon registration of his birth.\n\nIn 1924, Saramago's family moved to Lisbon, where his father started working as a policeman. A few months after the family moved to the capital, his brother Francisco, older by two years, died. He spent vacations with his grandparents in Azinhaga. When his grandfather suffered a stroke and was to be taken to Lisbon for treatment, Saramago recalled, \"He went into the yard of his house, where there were a few trees, fig-trees, olive trees. And he went one by one, embracing the trees and crying, saying goodbye to them because he knew he would not return. To see this, to live this, if that doesn't mark you for the rest of your life,\" Saramago said, \"you have no feeling.\" Although Saramago was a good pupil, his parents were unable to afford to keep him in grammar school, and instead moved him to a technical school at age 12.\n\nJosé Saramago: Memorial Do Convento · José Saramago: O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis\n\nAfter the democratic revolution in 1974, on 9 April 1975, during the rule of Vasco Gonçalves, Saramago became the assistant director of the newspaper Diário de Notícias, and the editorial line became clearly pro-communist. A group of 30 journalists - half the editorial staff - handed the board a petition calling for the editorial line to be revised and for it to be published. A plenary was called and, following an angry intervention by Saramago, 24 journalists were expelled, accused of being right-wingers. After the Coup of 25 November 1975 that put an end to the communist PREC, Saramago, in turn, was fired from the newspaper.\n\nJosé Saramago: Manual de Pintura e Caligrafia · José Saramago: Objecto Quase · José Saramago: Levantado do Chão · José Saramago: Viagem a Portugal\n\nLater life and international acclaim\n\nGiovanni Pontiero\n\nJosé Saramago: Memorial Do Convento · José Saramago: Baltasar and Blimunda\n\nJosé Saramago: The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis · José Saramago: The History of the Siege of Lisbon\n\nJosé Saramago: The History of the Siege of Lisbon\n\nPilar del Río\n\nIn 1986 Saramago met a Spanish intellectual and journalist, Pilar del Río, 27 years his junior, and he promptly ended his relationship with Isabel Nóbrega, his partner since 1968. They married in 1988 and remained together until his death in June 2010. Del Río is the official translator of Saramago's books into Spanish.\n\nJosé Saramago: The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\n\nIn 1998 Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature with the prize motivation: \"who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality.\"\n\nSaramago was expected to speak as the guest of honour at the European Writers' Parliament in 2010, which was convened in Istanbul following a proposal he had co-authored. However, Saramago died before the event took place.\n\nDeath and funeral\n\nSaramago suffered from leukemia. He died on 18 June 2010, aged 87, having spent the last few years of his life in Lanzarote, Spain. His family said that he had breakfast and chatted with his wife and translator Pilar del Río on Friday morning, after which he started feeling unwell and died. The Guardian described him as \"the finest Portuguese writer of his generation\", while Fernanda Eberstadt of The New York Times said he was \"known almost as much for his unfaltering Communism as for his fiction\".\n\nMargaret Jull Costa\n\nJosé Saramago: Claraboia\n\nFidel Castro\n\nPortugal declared two days of mourning. There were tributes from senior international politicians: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Bernard Kouchner (France) and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (Spain), while Cuba's Raúl and Fidel Castro sent flowers.\n\nSaramago's funeral was held in Lisbon on 20 June 2010, in the presence of more than 20,000 people, many of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometres, but also notably in the absence of right-wing President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva, who was holidaying in the Azores as the ceremony took place. Cavaco Silva, the Prime Minister who removed Saramago's work from the shortlist of the Aristeion Prize, said he did not attend Saramago's funeral because he \"had never had the privilege to know him\". Mourners, who questioned Cavaco Silva's absence in the presence of reporters, held copies of the red carnation, symbolic of Portugal's democratic revolution. Saramago's cremation took place in Lisbon, and his ashes were buried on the anniversary of his death, 18 June 2011, underneath a hundred-year-old olive tree on the square in front of the José Saramago Foundation (Casa dos Bicos).\n\nLost novel\n\nJosé Saramago: Skylight · José Saramago: Claraboia\n\nStyle and themes\n\nJosé Saramago: Blindness\n\nFernando Pessoa\n\nJosé Saramago: The Stone Raft · José Saramago: Blindness · José Saramago: The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis · José Saramago: Death at Intervals\n\nSaramago addresses serious matters with empathy for the human condition and for the isolation of contemporary urban life. His characters struggle with their need to connect with one another, form relations and bond as a community, and also with their need for individuality, and to find meaning and dignity outside of political and economic structures.\n\nWhen asked to describe his daily writing routine in 2009, Saramago responded, \"I write two pages. And then I read and read and read.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nJosé Saramago: The Gospel According to Jesus Christ · José Saramago: Cain · José Saramago: O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo\n\nThe book portrays a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of the crucifixion. Following the Swedish Academy's decision to present Saramago with the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Vatican questioned the decision on political grounds, though gave no comment on the aesthetic or literary components of Saramago's work. Saramago responded: \"The Vatican is easily scandalized, especially by people from outside. They should just focus on their prayers and leave people in peace. I respect those who believe, but I have no respect for the institution.\"\n\nSaramago was a member of the Communist Party of Portugal, and in his late years defined himself as a proponent of libertarian communism. He ran in the 1989 Lisbon local election as part of the \"Coalition For Lisbon,\" and was elected alderman presiding officer of the Municipal Assembly of Lisbon. Saramago was also a candidate of the Democratic Unity Coalition in all elections of the European Parliament from 1989 to 2009, though he ran for positions of which it was thought he had no possibility of winning. He was a critic of European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies.\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\nJosé Saramago: The Notebook\n\nWhen speaking to The Observer in 2006, Saramago said he \"believe[s] that we all have some influence, not because of the fact that one is an artist, but because we are citizens. As citizens, we all have an obligation to intervene and become involved, it's the citizen who changes things. I can't imagine myself outside any kind of social or political involvement.\"\n\nWole Soyinka\n\nDuring the Second Intifada, while visiting Ramallah in March 2002, Saramago said that \"what is happening in Palestine is a crime we can put on the same plane as what happened at Auschwitz ... A sense of impunity characterises the Israeli people and its army. They have turned into rentiers of the Holocaust.\" In an essay he wrote expanding on his views, Saramago wrote of Jews: \"educated and trained in the idea that any suffering that has been inflicted . . . on everyone else . . . will always be inferior to that which they themselves suffered in the Holocaust, the Jews endlessly scratch their own wound to keep it bleeding, to make it incurable, and they show it to the world as if it were a banner.\" Critics of these statements charged that they were antisemitic. Six months later, Saramago clarified. \"To have said that Israel's action is to be condemned, that war crimes are being perpetrated – really the Israelis are used to that. It doesn't bother them. But there are certain words they can't stand. And to say 'Auschwitz' there ... note well, I didn't say that Ramallah was the same as Auschwitz, that would be stupid. What I said was that the spirit of Auschwitz was present in Ramallah. We were eight writers. They all made condemning statements, Wole Soyinka, Breyten Breytenbach, Vincenzo Consolo and others. But the Israelis weren't bothered about those. It was the fact that I put my finger in the Auschwitz wound that made them jump.\"\n\nTariq Ali · John Berger · Noam Chomsky\n\nJosé Saramago: Blindness\n\nAwards and accolades\n\nJosé Saramago: A Viagem do Elefante\n\nNobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe Swedish Academy selected Saramago as the 1998 recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The announcement came when he was about to fly out of Germany after the Frankfurt Book Fair, and caught both him and his editor by surprise. The Nobel committee praised his \"parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony\", and his \"modern skepticism\" about official truths.\n\nDecorations\n\nThe José Saramago Foundation\n\nThe José Saramago Foundation was founded by José Saramago in June 2007, with the aim to defend and spread the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the promotion of culture in Portugal just like in all the countries, and protection of the environment. The José Saramago Foundation is located in the historic Casa dos Bicos in the city of Lisbon.\n\nList of works\n\nJosé Saramago: Terra do Pecado · José Saramago: Deste Mundo e do Outro · José Saramago: A Bagagem do Viajante · José Saramago: O Ano de 1993 · José Saramago: Manual de Pintura e Caligrafia · José Saramago: Manual of Painting and Calligraphy · José Saramago: Objecto Quase · José Saramago: Levantado do Chão · José Saramago: Raised from the Ground · José Saramago: Viagem a Portugal · José Saramago: Journey to Portugal · José Saramago: Memorial Do Convento · José Saramago: Baltasar and Blimunda · José Saramago: O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis · José Saramago: The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis · José Saramago: A Jangada de Pedra · José Saramago: The Stone Raft · José Saramago: História do Cerco de Lisboa · José Saramago: The History of the Siege of Lisbon · José Saramago: O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo · José Saramago: The Gospel According to Jesus Christ · José Saramago: Ensaio sobre a Cegueira · José Saramago: Blindness · José Saramago: Todos os Nomes · José Saramago: All the Names · José Saramago: O Conto da Ilha Desconhecida · José Saramago: The Tale of the Unknown Island · José Saramago: A Caverna · José Saramago: The Cave · José Saramago: A Maior Flor do Mundo · José Saramago: O Homem Duplicado · José Saramago: The Double · José Saramago: Ensaio sobre a Lucidez · José Saramago: Seeing · José Saramago: As Intermitências da Morte · José Saramago: As Pequenas Memórias · José Saramago: Small Memories · José Saramago: A Viagem do Elefante · José Saramago: The Elephant's Journey · José Saramago: Caim · José Saramago: Cain · José Saramago: Claraboia · José Saramago: Skylight\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nUrsula K.
