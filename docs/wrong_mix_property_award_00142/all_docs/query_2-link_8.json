        "text": "First Chapter: 'Blindness'\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Portuguese novelist José Saramago, an outspoken nonconformist who has a soft spot for the common man, was named the winner today of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.\n\nAFP PHOTO/ Katja LENZ José Saramago\n\nSaramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him one of Portugal's most popular contemporary writers, and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages.\n\n``I'm personally very happy,'' the writer said today in Frankfurt, Germany, where he was attending a bookfair. ``I'm also happy for my country.''\n\nThe Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''\n\n``He invokes tradition in a way that in the current state of things can be described as radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the $978,000 prize.\n\nSaramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,'' in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.\n\nThat device allows him to comment ironically ``about the authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major players in power politics.''\n\nSaramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive European to win the prestigious prize and the first laureate to write in Portuguese. Anxiety about the skewing of priorities in modern society is evident in all his works and also gives a clue to his resolute sympathy toward communists.\n\nHe had long been seen as one of the strongest potential candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.\n\nSaramago had planned to leave Germany today for his home in the Canary Islands. But as he waited in the airport, his publisher told him to go back to the fair, where a cheering rose-bearing crowd awaited him.\n\nHe told them he felt a special responsibility being the first winner from Portugal. ``Therefore it's a patriotic reason as well,'' he said through a translator, adding he hoped ``more people will read Portuguese'' now.\n\nAsked why his works are important, he said: ``That's not for me to decide. That's for my readers.''\n\nSaramago's regular newspaper and radio commentaries reflect views that are always inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man.\n\n``Blindness,'' his most recent book to be translated into English, is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society.\n\n``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of rationality,'' he said at the time. ``We're rational beings but we don't behave rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation in the world.''\n\nBorn Nov. 16, 1922, in the town of Azinhaga near Lisbon, Saramago was raised in the capital. From a poor family, he never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.\n\nHis first novel published in 1947 -- ``Terra do Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' -- was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. It sold badly, but won Saramago enough recognition to allow him jump from the welder's shop to a job on a literary magazine.\n\nYet for the next 18 years Saramago, then a committed communist who opposed the 41-year rightist dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.\n\nHe returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled by a military uprising in 1974.\n\nIn ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' from 1989, a Lisbon proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a stroke of his pen.\n\nSuch historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks.\n\nHe is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his writing is often described as realism tinged with Latin-American mysticism.\n\nThe literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started in 1969.\n\nThe Nobel Prize over the years has been given to writers with worldviews stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.\n\nThe prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell.\n\nLast year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.\n\nThe Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Monday, the physics and chemistry winners on Tuesday, the economics laureate on Wednesday and the peace prize on Oct. 16. All the prize announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is given in Oslo, Norway."
