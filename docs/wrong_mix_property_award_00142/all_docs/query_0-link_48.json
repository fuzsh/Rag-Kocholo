        "text": "#6Degrees\n\nSix degrees of separation:\n\nfrom tomorrow to the last days\n\nWe started with tomorrow, and as I had a lot of titles that could fit for the last book, it was fun using days.\n\nUsing my own rules for this fun meme hosted by Kate at Booksaremyfavouriteandbest\n\n(see there the origin of the meme and how it works\n\n‚Äì posted the first Saturday of every month).\n\nHere are my own quirky rules:\n\n1. Use your list of books on Goodreads\n\n2. Connect the books through key words\n\n5. To help you understand what I‚Äôm doing, you will find in orange the word that will be used in the following title, and in green the word used in the previous title\n\nWe are supposed to start from\n\nTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\n\nby Gabrielle Zevin\n\nI have read it, I hated it, it was a super disappointment compared to Zevin‚Äôs previous book.\n\nBUT my unhappy review is getting tons of views!\n\n1. Seeing into Tomorrow: Haiku, by Richard Wright It was fascinating to discover that Richard Wright wrote over 4,000 haiku, and that he started when he was in France.\n\nI liked that the book focuses on that.\n\n2. Seeing, by Jos√© SaramagoThis is on my TBR, because of next book here below:\n\n‚ÄúOn election day in the capital, it is raining so hard that no one has bothered to go out to vote. The politicians are growing jittery. Should they reschedule the elections for another day? Around three o‚Äô clock, the rain finally stops. Promptly at four, voters rush to the polling stations, as if they had been ordered to appear.\n\nBut when the ballots are counted, more than 70 percent are blank. The citizens are rebellious. A state of emergency is declared. But are the authorities acting too precipitously? Or even blindly? The word evokes terrible memories of the plague of blindness that hit the city four years before, and of the one woman who kept her sight. Could she be behind the blank ballots? A police superintendent is put on the case.\n\nWhat begins as a satire on governments and the sometimes dubious efficacy of the democratic system turns into something far more sinister. ‚Äú\n\n3. Blindness, by Jos√© SaramagoI only had two books with the word ‚Äúseeing‚Äù, so I‚Äôm going with this other book by Saramago that I so enjoyed!\n\nI was totally hooked by the first two paragraphs of Blindness, with the description of a common scene, some drivers waiting for the red light to turn green, and a traffic jam when one car does not seem to move, and I was stunned when I discovered the reason why, expressed in three simple words.\n\nCheck my review\n\n4. Kingdom of the Blind, by Louise Penny\n\nNot my favorite in the series, but still worth reading!\n\nCheck my short review\n\n5. The Last Kingdom, by Bernard Cornwell The first one in a wonderful series. This man knows how to write historical novels, with great characters and amazing battle scenes.\n\nThe only reason I stopped after volume 8 is I tend to read less historical fiction these days.\n\nCheck my review\n\n6. The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey, by Walter MosleyI so enjoyed this book, and the description oft he characters.\n\nI only tried another one by Mosley since. Waiting for recommendations please\n\nCheck my full review\n\nüìöüìöüìö\n\nVisit other chains here\n\nüìöüìöüìö\n\nHAVE YOU READ AND ENJOYED ANY OF THESE BOOKS?\n\nIF YOU HAVE CREATED A CHAIN,\n\nPLEASE LEAVE YOUR LINK IN A COMMENT\n\nRevisiting what I posted 10 years ago\n\n(my blog was born on September 29, 2010)\n\nfollowing the idea I found at The Chocolate Lady‚Äôs Book Review Blog\n\n(click on this link or the logo to see where the idea started from,\n\nand to post the link to your own post).\n\nüìö üìö üìö\n\nToday, I‚Äôm revisiting August 2013.\n\nI published 14 posts, only 6 of which being book reviews.\n\nOf these books, here is the one that received most views then:\n\nClick on the cover to access my review\n\nIt was a very intense and powerful historical novel about the French Resistance.\n\nI also enjoyed a lot this one, a classic by the Portuguese Nobel Prize winner in literature:\n\nThe beginning is one of the most amazing surprises I got in literature. I wish I had forgotten the sentence when the driver stops at the light, to experience that same surprise again, but I haven‚Äôt forgotten it yet!\n\nüìö üìö üìö\n\nHAVE YOU READ THESE BOOKS?\n\nPLEASE SHARE YOUR THROWBACK THURSDAY POST\n\nMy next post on this meme will be on December 7\n\nBlindness\n\nby\n\nJos√© SARAMAGO\n\nTranslated by\n\nGiovanni PONTIERO\n\n326 pages\n\nPublished in 1995\n\nPublished in translation in 1999\n\nThis book counts for the following Reading Challenges:\n\nMY THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS BOOK\n\nI still need to visit a few countries to complete the 52-countries-reading challenge I started last year. So this time, I went to Portugal, in company of its Nobel Prize winner in literature.\n\nI was totally hooked by the first 2 paragraphs of Blindness, with the description of a common scene, some drivers waiting for the red light to turn green, and a traffic jam when one car does not seem to move, and I was stunned when I discovered the reason why, expressed in 3 simple words.\n\nThen little by little, you discover how a strange case of blindness turns into an epidemic.\n\nYou meet the first people touched by it, and how they are related.\n\nThe country and its army decide to use drastic measures to stop the disease, and to do so, they basically intern the sick and the potentially sick in an old unused mental hospital.\n\nAs no one dares approaching them for fear of catching the disease, the sick are given little food, no comfort, and they have to completely take care of themselves, even in case of death.\n\nThe mental hospital becomes a microcosmic image of the world around us, as instincts, passions and vices slowly become very obvious amidst this group of people.\n\nThe book raises the question of how we look at the world, at people.\n\nThrough a particular female character, I won‚Äôt tell you what‚Äôs special about her of course, the author addresses the issue of honesty, of motives, of self-interest and self-sacrifice.\n\nIt is also a reflection on violence, and probably also on police states.\n\nThe content becomes rather gruesome, but I enjoyed a lot the style of the book, semi-post-modernist: the writing is very fluid, with hardly any punctuation apart from comas and periods.\n\nThere are no quotation marks for instance for dialogues: the dialogues are written in the format of paragraphs, with just comas separating what one person says and what another replies, and a capital letter starting the sentence pronounced by the other person, so sometimes it may seem a bit obscure, unless you enjoy post-modernism as I do.\n\nI loved the descriptions of settings and characters.\n\nThe author must know blind people himself, seeing how good he is at translating their perception of reality.\n\nI also liked how he inserted here and there some thoughts on life and human condition in general.\n\nIf you have tried reading some Nobel Prize winners, you may have wondered why on earth they got that special award. This was not the case for me with this book, as his writing is really very interesting. I encourage you to try to read this book.\n\nThere‚Äôs actually a sequel, called Seeing. And Blindness has been made into a movie; I‚Äôm still debating if I‚Äôm going to try to watch it or not, as some scenes may be way too disturbing for me on screen.\n\nQUOTATIONS\n\nEpigraph:\n\n‚ÄúIf you can see, look.\n\nIf you can look, observe.‚Äù From the Book of Exhortations\n\nIf we cannot live entirely like humans, at least let us do everything in our power not to live like animals. page 116\n\nWhy did we become blind, I don‚Äôt know, perhaps one day we‚Äôll find out, Do you want me to tell you what I think, Yes, do, I don‚Äôt think we did go blind, I thunk we are blind, Blind but seeing, Blind people who can see, but do not see. page 326\n\nWHAT IS IT ABOUT\n\nFrom Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning author Jos√© Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss\n\nA city is hit by an epidemic of ‚Äúwhite blindness‚Äù that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges‚Äîamong them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears‚Äîthrough the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As Blindness reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that‚Äôs bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength. [from Goodreads]\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJos√© de Sousa Saramago is a Nobel-laureate Portuguese novelist, playwright and journalist. He was a member of the Portuguese Communist Party.\n\nHis works, some of which can be seen as allegories, commonly present subversive perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the human factor rather than the officially sanctioned story. Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1998. He founded the National Front for the Defense of Culture (Lisbon, 1992) with among others Freitas-Magalhaes. He lived on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, Spain, where he died in June 2010.\n\nA foundation with his name was established in 2007; its main aims are cultural promotion, particularly of Portuguese literature and authors. The Jos√© Saramago Foundation is currently based in Casa dos Bicos, a Portuguese landmark building in Lisbon. Saramago‚Äôs house in Lanzarote is also open to the public.\n\nJos√© Saramago, together with his wife Pilar, were the subject of the award-winning documentary Jos√© e Pilar, providing us with a glimpse into their love story and life, as he was writing his A Viagem do Elefante.\n\n***\n\nHAVE YOU READ THIS BOOK YET?\n\nHAVE YOU WATCHED THE MOVIE?\n\nWHO IS YOUR FAVORITE\n\nPORTUGUESE AUTHOR?\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS IN A COMMENT PLEASE"
