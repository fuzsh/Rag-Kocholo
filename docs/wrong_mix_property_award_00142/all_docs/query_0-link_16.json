        "text": "Who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality. – Nobel prize in Literature 1998\n\nFor Livraria Lello, to speak about the Nobel Prize in Literature is speaking about José Saramago, the only Portuguese language author who has ever been laureated by the Sweedish Academy. Therefore, it would be impossible and unfair to celebrate his legacy without the partnership with the José Saramago Foundation, keeper of the author’s ideas, work, and legacy.\n\nOn this occasion, Livraria Lello and the Saramago Foundation open the doors to a new unique space, where the author comes to live through some of his personal objects, the stories that paved his path, the images that recorded his most precious moments and, inevitably, through every single page he has ever written.\n\nSaramago Collection\n\nWhen the Sala Saramago was inaugurated, Livraria Lello launched a new collection with four works by the author, which materializes the tribute to a an ambassador of portuguese culture.\n\nJosé Saramago was made immortal by literary critics and through time. Baltasar and Blimunda, Blindness, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ and Death at Intervals are just a few titles of his legacy to all mankind.\n\nThese are the four iconic works included in the new exclusive collection published by Livraria Lello in collaboration with Porto Editora and the José Saramago Foundation."
