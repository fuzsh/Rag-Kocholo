        "text": "Wesleyan University Arts and Humanities\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nWesleyan Arts and Humanities\n\n·\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nFeb 14, 2024\n\n--\n\nOn Valentine's Day, many of us get into the spirit by consuming all things love-related. For your reading pleasure this year, here is a roundup of what the English professors recommend adding to your Valentine's Day TBR + why.\n\nMatthew Garrett, Associate Professor of English & American Studies\n\nRecommendation: A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, by Roland Barthes\n\nMy recommended Valentine’s Day reading is no surprise, and it is itself one of my beloved objects: A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, by Roland Barthes, published originally in French in 1977 and in English translation the next year. This extraordinary book is a gathering of the “figures” that emerge from the lover’s “outbursts of language.” Rather than a love story with a plot and a happy ending, Barthes gives a series of arbitrarily (alphabetically) ordered motifs and episodes from the lover’s experience. On the holiday when many feel sorted into awkward couplings and gorged on saccharine treats and stale cardboard clichés, Barthes brings the lover back to life as a peculiarly solitary subject, nourished by their very hunger of longing for the beloved: “someone speaking within themselves, amorously, confronting the other (the loved object), who does not speak.” And yet within this peculiar, panicky loneliness, new and surprising styles of connection emerge: “The perfect interlocutor, the friend, are they not the one who constructs around you the greatest possible resonance? Cannot friendship be defined as a space of total sonority?” There may be no better friend on Valentine’s Day than the author of those sentences.\n\nAmy Tang, Associate Professor of English\n\nRecommendation: Salt Fish Girl by Larissa Lai\n\nI recommend Larissa Lai’s Salt Fish Girl, which I am teaching right now in my course Asian American Posthumanisms. A speculative novel, it is also a queer love story that crosses boundaries of time, geography, and even species. The novel features a doubled plotline: the first takes place in 19th century China, and follows a romance between a goddess-turned human named Nu Wa and the titular Salt Fish Girl; the second takes place in a dystopian 2044, and tracks a love affair between Miranda, a girl conceived through the transgenic mingling of a durian fruit and a Chinese cabaret singer, and Evie, a bio-engineered clone who is 2% carp. These romantic relationships are slowly revealed to be ways of thinking about other kinds of assemblages: unexpected kinships, alliances, resistance movements, and collectivities forged through transpacific circuits and mutations of labor, biocapital, and mythology.\n\nDouglas Arthur Martin, Associate Professor of English\n\nRecommendations:\n\nI Sing to Use the Waiting by Zachary Pace\n\nSing a Black Girl’s Song by Ntozake Shange\n\nA Woman’s Battles and Transformations by Édouard Louis\n\nSo, this is a trickier question than one might initially assume oneself to be asking, particularly when posed to a scholar of literatures of slavery and deconstructive literary theory. One of my favorite poets is Aimé Césaire; his first name is Beloved, and I’d encourage whoever is reading this to read his\n\npolemic Discourse on Colonialism (1950), for example, about, among other things, the malevolence of colonialism presented as benevolence, force dressed up as salvation.\n\nAnd every Valentine’s Day, truthfully, I think of Jacques Derrida saying to an interviewer in the documentary film about “him,” about “his life” (as if), and also about the weird place or not-place of bio, of personal life in the history of philosophers, when she asks him what he has to say about love, l’amour. He asks back to the question and back to her, l’amour ou la mort? Love! Not death! she says sentimentally. And he says, Rien, nothing, he has nothing to say when asked just like that. He has an “empty head” about love (lol). (Watch a clip here from Derrida, Dir. Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, 2002). There is humor here and double entendre that I cannot get into with the implied economy of this question-and-answer, especially because we would wind up talking about, I don’t know, onanism and Rousseau and sex addiction and Saint Augustine, which no one wants to do.\n\nBut don’t lose track of that phonetic slippage in the French. It leads me back to Colin (née Joan) Dayan’s chapter “Gothic Americas” in Haiti, History, and the Gods (1999), where she writes about the conversion of love into possession in Francophone and Anglophone early colonial letters, and the “gothic” mode of so-called history: “The most compelling nineteenth-century fictions — for example, “love” stories, the Brontes’ Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, and Herman Melville’s Pierre — are bent on proving how the language of romance can animate and sustain utter servility. What Beverley Tucker called “the law of love” depended absolutely on the existence of human property. The rare and special love between slave and master, based on the bond of property, becomes the medium by which perfect submission becomes equivalent to a pure (if perverse) love. And sentiment, as Poe confirmed in “The Black Cat,” is not only coercive but despotic. A slave, a black pet, a white wife, once loved in the proper domestic setting, exacts a bond that, as Captain Delano in Melville’s Benito Cereno confessed, is not possible between two equals” (192–193). So, there are several reading suggestions that I am slightly cleverly (not that cleverly, but, you know, somewhat) ventriloquizing in that specific passage selection. (Read them all!)\n\nAnd I am coming to how the grounds of your question, that come before it and, so, are unspoken in your question, are ones that are not “pure” for me as a reader, for more reasons than I would ever disclose — they’re inextinguishably fraught (that’s why they are also worth thinking about). Love and death, “love” and sadism, decadence and destruction, abjection and sovereignty, all this is in that ground before the question. But, here, let me “give” a little, in my way.\n\nI can read for something like “love,” for example, by which, perhaps, I mean the unknown, in Hayao Miyazaki’s film となりのトトロ, My Neighbor Totoro (1988) and one of my child’s current favorite books called Circle (Mac Barnett, Jon Klassen, 2019; I keep trying to slip in an illustrated children’s version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, also relevant to the question, but she only has eyes for Circle, alas). I don’t point to these examples because I implicitly think that love is juvenile, no (its phonetic slippage into death above was not only a joke, but a grave matter, for one would die for what one loves, no? Even if only rhetorically. But wouldn’t that risk some materialization…? And would one be so arrogant as to assume to know what such could “look” like?) The commonality that I see between Totoro and Circle, or that I am forcing for this milieu, has to do with encountering an inexplicable phenomenon, that cannot be rationalized, or that points to the limits of rationality. In both texts, characters “encounter” or “invent” a figure or shape at the linguistic-sensorial limits of their perception of phenomena and the potential loss of someone (or something) beloved. There…where one could have yielded to fear and forced violence in the encounter with the unknown is an answer to your question. At those limits, at least for Mei, Satsuki, and Circle, are Totoro(s), Catbus, and a shape that is not defined but whose in-definition need not be violated (or violated again, if a prior violation is why it is the way it is). Happy Valentine’s as we move into the age of Aquarius… Here are some tunes.\n\nMaaza Mengiste, Professor of English\n\nRaised from the Ground by Jose Saramago\n\nThis novel by Saramago, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Literature (read his Nobel speech!), spans generations of the Mau Tempo family, who toiled as farm laborers in the Alentejo province of Portugal. It is a story of family and community, of resistance against oppression and hope. It is also a story of love and the many ways it manifests. Highly recommended for those who want a tender novel that is immediately immersive.\n\nThat concludes the roundup of Valentine’s Day recommendations from the Wesleyan University English professors!\n\nDon’t forget to follow us on our medium page and social media accounts (Instagram and X) to stay updated on all the latest within the arts and humanities."
