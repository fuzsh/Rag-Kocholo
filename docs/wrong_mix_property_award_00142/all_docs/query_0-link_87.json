Also of note is a diary/scrapbook (inserted between p. 472 and p. 473) by Pilar del Rio (a Spanish journalist and Saramago�s wife) of the period of time between the announcement of the Saramago being named the 1998 Nobel Laureate for Literature in October 1998 through Saramago's trip to Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize in December 1998.\n\nhttp://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1998/\n\nOfficial web site of the Nobel Foundation containing information about José Saramago as the 1998 Nobel laureate in Literature.
