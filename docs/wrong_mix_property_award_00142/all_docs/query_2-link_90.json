        "text": "“I tried for years to write something less dark,”\n\nthe historian DK said to Katie Couric,\n\nwho crossed her shapely legs at the knee.\n\nI imagined the sheen on Katie’s skin the byproduct\n\nof some expensive body oil. “Fiction would have\n\noffered a lovely diversion,” the scholar continued.\n\n“A murder mystery? A giant relief. They’re just,\n\nwell, not me.” Katie stared for several seconds\n\ninto DK—a large black hole hovering\n\njust above the guest couch, a circle of darkness\n\nlike a puncture in space, made even more apparent by\n\nthe cream-color seatback that offered contrasting relief.\n\nEstimating DK’s diameter at three feet, I feared\n\nthe petite Katie would get sucked into its blankness.\n\nYet feisty as ever she held her ground. “But you’re\n\nso successful,” Katie said, “and people just love reading\n\nyour work.” She ran her fingers along a shiny leg.\n\n“Irresistible terror, page-turning awfulness.”\n\nShe looked up from the paper she’d been reading.\n\n“Is that why your books have never been turned\n\ninto documentaries? Too gruesome for the human eye?”\n\n“Good question.” “Then how do you make history read\n\nlike fiction?” She flashed one of her big Katie-smiles.\n\nThe studio audience clapped wildly until\n\na booming screech followed by a bang rocked the studio,\n\nas if a semi had collided with something solid and deadly.\n\nThe audience clutched their seats, bracing for impact.\n\nKatie didn’t flinch. “Like it or not,” the guest answered,\n\n“my books contain facts. Nothing more, nothing less.”\n\nThey took off on a tangent then, something about\n\ngreed and growth and a dishonored planet,\n\nand I must have drifted off, daydreaming I’d held a party\n\non the beach, everyone drinking and kicking up the sands\n\nof time, skin baking in the sun until it withered and sagged,\n\nbefore the inevitable bloat and rot, flesh falling off\n\nthe bone, but they kept laughing and drinking, believing\n\nthere’s a reason to smear lotion on their faces, even as\n\nthey went putrid and rank, even as the liquor ran out,\n\nwhen I heard Katie say, “You mustn’t be so hard\n\non yourself. Stripes on a tiger and all that.”\n\n“Precisely my reason for being here today,” DK said,\n\n“to share a fundamental truth.” The host leaned in\n\ntoward the darkness. “Yes?” You could hear a pin drop.\n\n“Objects hurling through space tend to pick up speed.”\n\n“Yes?” “So check your brakes.” “You’re saying\n\nwe need to check our brakes.” “Yes.” “But to what end?”\n\nThe darkness pulsed like a heartbeat, growing ever\n\nso slightly. “Exactly my point,” DK replied.\n\n“To what end indeed.” (Note)"
