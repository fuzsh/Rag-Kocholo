        "text": "Premier League footballers, pop stars, bankers and many other high earners who invested in British films to reduce their tax bill are facing a nasty surprise, following a recent high court ruling.\n\nThey could be forced to pay £2bn in back taxes, after the court upheld a test case brought by HM Revenue and Customs against the way tax breaks were used to finance Mrs Henderson Presents, the 2005 comedy directed by Stephen Frears and starring Judi Dench.\n\nAccording to tax experts, the ruling by Mr Justice Baker against the Micro Fusion production partnership would also invalidate hundreds of other similar schemes that operated between 2002 and 2005.\n\nVirtually every British film made during that time used these financing methods, ranging from Hollywood blockbusters such as the Harry Potter franchise to small independent movies. No one will be pursuing the film-makers for the cash they have already spent. But the wealthy individuals who used production partnerships as a tax shelter could be landed with a hefty bill from HMRC – plus interest.\n\nThe case centres on the practice of \"double dipping,\" where producers essentially claimed the same tax break twice for one film – first via a production partnership, and then via a sale-and-leaseback deal. In this way, they could raise about 40% of their budget from investors who received more back in tax than they spent.\n\nDouble dipping was permitted by the old Section 42 and Section 48 film tax relief legislation. Producers only discovered this loophole in 2002, and used it extensively until the government closed it down at the end of 2005. In the meantime, production partnerships alone cost the Treasury around £2bn in lost tax revenues, according to some estimates.\n\nMicro Fusion was one of the most popular Section 48 production partnerships. It raised £300m across 22 partnerships, including £13m to produce Mrs Henderson Presents.\n\nThe unforeseen scale of those losses to the public purse explains why the government finally abolished Section 42 and Section 48 entirely, replacing them in 2007 with a simpler tax credit. Under this new system, the government paid out a modest £104m in tax relief between January 2007 and March 2008.\n\nBut with the public finances under severe pressure, HMRC is now subjecting every scheme that operated under the old system to intense scrutiny, in the hope of finding legal flaws. The Micro Fusion case sets a precedent, and is likely to be the first of many brought against production partnerships. First, however, HMRC will have to defend its victory in the court of appeal. Future Capital Partners, the company behind Micro Fusion, says it will fight the ruling all the way to the House of Lords."
