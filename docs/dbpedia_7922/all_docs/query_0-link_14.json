        "text": "Judi Dench stars as the title character, an eccentric (arenât they always?) rich widow who buys a theater in late 1930s London. She hires Bob Hoskins to manage the theater. Over the course of the war they end up turning the theater into a nude revue. The story focuses on the relationship between the title characters, as well as the show performers. Itâs cute and entertaining, and Dench brings some real feeling to her role â but it is definitely aimed at the mum crowd (not that thatâs a bad thing! My mother loved it!). Designer Sandy Powellâs costuming is, as always, stunning, with really great pre-war and wartime styles (Denchâs well-to-do late 1930s wear is particularly stunning, and Iâm always a sucker for 1940s hairstyles)."
