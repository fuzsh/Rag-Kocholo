        "text": "Show Bio\n\nThe multi award-winning production of Noël Coward’s provocative comedy featuring Andrew Scott (Vanya, Fleabag) returns to the big screen.\n\nAs he prepares to embark on an overseas tour, star actor Garry Essendine’s colourful life is in danger of spiralling out of control. Engulfed by an escalating identity crisis as his many and various relationships compete for his attention, Garry’s few remaining days at home are a chaotic whirlwind of love, sex, panic and soul-searching.\n\nFilmed live from The Old Vic in London during a sold out run in 2019, Matthew Warchus (Matilda The Musical) directs this giddy and surprisingly modern reflection on fame, desire and loneliness.\n\nWhat is an NT Live?\n\nNational Theatre Live brings the best of British theatre to screens near you! Enjoy big shows and big names in the comfort of the Mercury Studio, with these screenings of award-winning and unmissable theatre, pre-recorded at the National Theatre in London."
