Every donation will make a difference â from tackling poverty, to providing food, or essential healthcare to safe shelter. Comic Relief is extremely grateful to everyone â including the public, our partners, schools, and workplaces â who have come together and helped spread joy, and raise spirits and vital funds.\n\nThis eveningâs fun-filled evening of entertainment was broadcast live on BBC One, BBC Two and BBC iPlayer from Media City UK in Salford. In what was his final year of hosting the Red Nose Day night of TV, Sir Lenny Henry was joined by David Tennant, Davina McCall, Joel Dommett, Maya Jama, Paddy McGuinness, Romesh Ranganathan and Rosie Ramsey. Bringing together some of the nationâs biggest and best comics and entertainers, the night of TV delivered an unforgettable evening of comedy, live performances and one-off surprises.\n\nAfter nearly four decades of presenting, tonightâs Red Nose Day night of TV saw some extra special moments for Sir Lenny Henry throughout the course of the night. Sir Lenny joined the cast of W1A â Hugh Bonneville, Hugh Skinner, Jessica Hynes and Monica Dolan â in a bid to find his replacement host. In what was their first TV appearance together for seven years, the W1A team were put through their paces in an interview process that became more ridiculous by the second â featuring stars including Chesney Hawkes, Lorraine Kelly, Sir Mo Farah, Rustie Lee, Romesh Ranganathan, Tom Davis and many more.\n\nAn especially emotional and poignant moment on the night saw Sir Lenny surprised by a whole host of people who have benefited from Comic Relief funding over the past 39 years, from here in the UK and across the world.\n\nComic Relief co-founder and Life President, Sir Lenny Henry said: âTonight was a red hot, super duper, magical night on so many levels and jam packed with surprises that I honestly would never have thought possible. My last time hosting the show has been incredibly special and Iâm already thinking about what we can do to make next year, our 40th anniversary, even more so.\n\n\" The money raised tonight is phenomenal. For the British public to give so generously whilst struggling through a cost of living crisis is, for me, one of the most beautiful things about this country. We never stop caring.\n\n\"We all share that fundamental belief in helping others, itâs a common thread that unites us and remains as strong now as it did when we started Red Nose Day back in 1988. We are all neighbours, and we need to keep looking out for each other. From the bottom of my Red Nose-shaped heart, thank you.â\n\nAs ever, the evening was packed to the rafters full of comedy specials and musical performances. Viewers saw a cast of award-winning actors and comedians play some of the most iconic characters from series two of The Traitors, in a spoof movie version of the hit BBC One show that gripped the nation. Asim Chaudhry, Catherine Tate, Jonathan Bailey, Sally Phillips, Suranne Jones and more, brought back some of the most iconic moments, from that chalice of fizzy rosÃ© to Rossâ infamous wink, and Jazatha Christie forever being ignored.\n\nSome of Hollywoodâs finest came together to argue it out to be named the most famous face in a celebrity Z-to-A-listers sketch. Forget the Oscarsâ¦for these contenders, this was a career defining accolade they just had to win. The whoâs who of a lineup saw Sir Lenny Henry (who else?!) come out on top against the likes of Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Liam Neeson, Olivia Colman and more. In keeping with the Oscars theme, Sir Lenny gave a stunning performance of the Oscar nominated song from the Barbie film, with a Red Nose Day twist, Iâm Just Len. Meanwhile, in the CBeebies Bedtime Story corner, Kate Winslet gave a special reading â especially for parents â of F***, Now There Are Two of You.\n\nElliott Stanley, played by Jamie Dornan in BBC Oneâs The Tourist, took to the Mastermind chair to go face to face with Clive Myrie over his (lack of) General Knowledge; over at the North Norfolk Digital studios, Alan Partridge, played by Steve Coogan, returned to the airwaves with Sidekick Simon for a Red Nose Day special; Luke Littler put his darts skills to the test, much to the detriment of Harry Clark, Sara Davies, Vicky Pattison and Gladiators, Sabre and Viper; plus much, much more.\n\nThe jam-packed evening of entertainment also featured incredible music performances throughout the night. Kicking off this yearâs night of TV, McFly opened the show with a special medley of some of the most-loved Comic Relief singles, including Walk This Way and All About You. Paloma Faith performed her new single, Enjoy Yourself (The Red Nose Day Edition), while JERUB took to the stage with a moving performance of A Change Is Gonna Come â Sir Lennyâs favourite song. There was also a special performance by the cast of Just For One Day, the Live Aid Musical.\n\nThroughout the night, viewers saw how their donations could help, and have helped, people trying to get by in the face of poverty and injustice in the UK and around the world. They saw Mel B introduce a poignant film about domestic abuse, Jodie Whittaker introduce a film about the support given to children with additional needs or disabilities, and Jay Blades shed light on the reality of UK poverty during the cost of living crisis. A film with Ambika Mod drew attention to stories of young refugees escaping danger, whilst Comic Relief co-founders, Sir Lenny Henry and Richard Curtis, spent time reflecting on some of the films Lenny has made, over the last 39 years.\n\nDavina McCall said: âItâs always such a privilege to don my Red Nose and spend the evening in the company of our beautiful viewers. Red Nose Day wouldnât be Red Nose Day without you, and weâre so grateful for the love, kindness and compassion that youâve shown this evening. Things are tough for so many people, so to have raised over Â£38.6million is nothing short of amazing. Whatever youâve been able to give tonight, big or small, know that you have played a huge part in helping to change lives. Thank you, thank you so, so much.â\n\nSamir Patel, CEO of Comic Relief, said: âTonight was a reminder that when people come together, great things can happen. Itâs what Red Nose Day has always been, and will always be, about. Weâre so proud to have so far raised Â£38.6million. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the truly incredible British public, and our partners who have once again gone to inspiring lengths to raise an extraordinary amount of money. With so many people struggling, and with millions impacted by poverty and injustice, the money raised this Red Nose Day will make a life-changing difference to so many people here in the UK and around the world. On behalf of us all, thank you.â\n\nIncredible prizes featured on the show, that are still open for entries, include the same Aston Martin V12 Vanquish model made famous by James Bond in âDie Another Dayâ, generously donated by Chris Evans and CarFest, and one of the most sought after prizes in pop â six hospitality tickets to see Taylor Swift live at Wembley on The Eras Tour. The lucky winner of the Taylor Swift prize will be heading to Wembley on Monday 19 August 2024 with five of their guests for an evening which will be hosted by BBC Radio 2 presenter, Sara Cox â with travel and accommodation covered too.
