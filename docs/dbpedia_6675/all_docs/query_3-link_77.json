Through the YANA program, the larger shift that I see is that there is a lot more receptiveness to mental health awareness, not just with school children and teachers, but also the larger school ecosystem, which includes parents and the administration. This is something that I think is a huge takeaway from the YANA program.\n\nI think the most memorable moments for me have been when we end the session and children walk out of the class, they come back and say thank you for talking about anxiety, thank you for talking about depression, thank you for talking about body shaming and bullying. Basically, we have given them a “word” for the experience that they have already been going through and that really helps them. It was very liberating for them to have sat in the sessions. Those faces of those children are what I take away from this experience.”\n\nThe association with LLL has been very precious because through them, we are able to approach the schools and cover so many students. It has given us a platform to meet schools, students, principals and teachers and deliver sessions. This partnership has been fabulous till date.\n\nThe curiosity level is very high when we approach the schools. Schools agree that this is a topic that needs awareness, sometimes they are happy to allow us, sometimes they are apprehensive since this is a sensitive topic where they wish to discuss internally and get back to us.\n\nOverall, when we take sessions, they usually know about the terms “depression” and “anxiety”, but they do not know what it actually means. They are usually confused and believe that sadness and depression are one and the same thing. After the session, many students come up to us to say that they are able to associate with whatever has been delivered here, because they can identify some of these symptoms in themselves or their loved ones. This is a very fruitful awareness that we have created. This is why we are attached to this program – to create that level of awareness.\n\nWith ‘Mental Health’ heading towards becoming the next pandemic, the contribution of TLLLF stands out in terms of its wide reach. It is gratifying to know that organizations like TLLLF are working towards breaking the mental health stigma and being there for the people who are struggling with these issues.\n\nTLLLF has been spearheading the cause of creating social awareness and has helped directing the calls from the distressed to our helpline using the details published on TLLLF’s website. Your dynamic and compassionate founder and committed team go out of their way to promote awareness about mental health.\n\nMitram Foundation is privileged to be a part of this worthy cause and we are extremely thankful to TLLLF for their consistent support.\n\nIn gratitude.\n\nVanita Naval & Dr. Nitesh Dave"
