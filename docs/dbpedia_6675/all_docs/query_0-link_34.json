Faced with this heart-breaking dilemma, they try and work out ways to be with each other.\n\nThe film portrays the struggle that comes with falling love, yet trying to desperately keep it alive.\n\n2. The Spectacular Now\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nThe film comes highly recommended by Oprah, which should be reason enough to watch it.\n\nThe story revolves around a guy who has a rebellious philosophy on life and ends up partying his life away in high school. But all that changes when he meets the not-so-typical “nice girl” who makes him a better man.\n\nFor those who are thinking of it as just another high school love story, I can assure you it’s much more than that. It’s about how love can change our lives for the better, and how it makes us realise that we can be better.\n\nIn addition, the actors – Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller, two great actors of the young generation – have given some good performance considering the role of such strong characters. Furthermore, the music is beautiful and enhances the romantic essence of the film.\n\n3. Flipped\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nThis is a really cute movie and one of my personal favourites.\n\nIt’s about a little boy who ends up falling in love with a girl next door. What makes it stand out is its intricately portrayed contradiction of the notion that only grownups are affected by social differences, as that is not the case in this movie. While it is one of the most unconventional romantic films, it will leave you feeling mushy and cute inside and out, and with a strange realisation...\n\n4. One Day\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: Fanpop\n\nImagine being in love with your best friend, someone you have known for a very long time who also happens to be extremely handsome and famous, due to which he hardly has time for you and you only get to see him once a year. The memories of meeting him that one day define the depth of the relationship you both share. But when your best friend goes through a bad patch and loses his fame, you cannot help but fall further in love with him. That is what One Day is all about.\n\nIt’s a mundanely sad and fascinating story about friendship which transforms into love.\n\n5. Ruby Sparks\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nThis movie makes you question the idea of romance that we have in our heads and how unrealistic it actually is.\n\nThe plot revolves around a writer whose first novel was such a success that he is struggling with writer’s block for his next one. That is when he meets the girl of his dreams, the girl perfect to be the subject of his book. He ends up falling in love with the subject of his book and makes her love him back. After all, he is the one who created her in the first place.\n\n6. In Your Eyes\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nRevolving around an eerie telepathic connection that two people share, the movie talks about how they are able to see into each other’s minds and see the things they are seeing. Both are living different lives but feel the same feelings at the same time. If one is sad or upset, it affects the other similarly and simultaneously. So on a quest to discover what the connection really is, they set on a journey to figure things out while falling in love with each other.\n\n7. The One I Love\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nSometimes one needs to be reminded of who and what they were before marriage, before life got in the way and before love was just an excuse to explain stupid things.\n\nIn this film, a couple struggling with their marriage, go for a weekend vacation on the suggestion of their therapist in order to find a way to save their marriage from falling apart. There they discover that when one is without the other, the appealing image of their significant other as being the best of his or herself appears and shows them what they had been missing in their life.\n\n8. What if\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nThe film portrays how a guy feels when he falls in love with his friend, a girl he cannot have, and what measures he takes to not let it affect their friendship.\n\nEven though it is a typical movie about best friends falling in love with one another, where it stands out from the rest is that it’s not a romance-comedy styled film filled with cheesy songs and dialogues. Although the movie is humorous in its own ways, it refrains from using clichéd sequences to make things more relatable, thus making it realistic.\n\n9. Stuck in Love\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nThe movie revolves around a divorced writer, his ex-wife, his teenage son who lives with him, and his daughter who is in college becoming a writer. The film chronicles the love life of each of these people – even if it is an obsession with a certain favourite writer – and shows how much we are influenced by our families and the families of the ones we love.\n\nEven though the plot is a bit predictable, you will still want to watch the movie simply because you can relate to it to an extent.\n\n10. Now is Good\n\n￼\n\nPhoto: IMDb\n\nEveryone loves a good sob once in a while and if you thought The Fault in Our Stars was a good snivel, then you will like Now is Good. The lead, played by Dakota Fanning with a British accent, is suffering from leukaemia. And while she is ready to accept death, she falls in love with the boy next door who helps her check everything off of the crazy bucket list she has compiled, falling in love and losing her virginity being one of them.\n\nSo there you have it. This list will make you cry, laugh, feel numb and be able to relate to the characters and plots. You can feel all these emotions on a comfy day in on Valentine’s Day with the love of your life, and your other love – food! Not only will you be sharing certain emotions with your loved one, you will also be sharing your perspective of your relationship since we all know certain “Do you think we’re like them” questions will be thrown your way.\n\nIn case you are flying solo on this ‘day of love’, fear not, all of these movies will be all the company you need. You can watch these and look forward to the day you have someone sitting next to you, next year! #somethingtowatch #Movie #Movie\n\nComments ( )\n\n0/500\n\nNew Comments（ ）\n\nMéphisto82\n\nTalia_Kilson\n\nPinkDuchess\n\nNgugi Super"
