        "text": "By Noël Coward\n\nPresented by NT Live\n\nOur lift is currently out of order and we are working to resolve the issue. Apologies for any inconvenience caused and thanks for your understanding.\n\nThe multi award-winning production of Noël Coward’s provocative comedy featuring Andrew Scott (Vanya, Fleabag) returns to the big screen at Gala Durham.\n\nAs he prepares to embark on an overseas tour, star actor Garry Essendine’s colourful life is in danger of spiralling out of control. Engulfed by an escalating identity crisis as his many and various relationships compete for his attention, Garry’s few remaining days at home are a chaotic whirlwind of love, sex, panic and soul-searching.\n\nFilmed live from The Old Vic in London during a sold out run in 2019, Matthew Warchus (Matilda The Musical) directs this giddy and surprisingly modern reflection on fame, desire and loneliness.\n\nRunning time: 180 minutes including interval\n\nBBFC Classification: PG\n\nTickets\n\n£15 (£13 concession), £10 Gala Members"
