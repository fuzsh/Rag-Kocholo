        "text": "THE movie edition of Vladimir Nabokov's 1938 novel \"Laughter in the Dark,\" which arrived at the Little Carnegie yesterday, is beautifully colored proof, literal and figurative, of the abnormality of some seemingly normal human animals. But a viewer sometimes feels a disturbingly simple soapopera effect despite the film's evident serious intentions.The author summarized his case history on the first page of his book by indicating that it dealt with a rich, respectable esthete who abandons his wife and family for an unloving, grasping mistress and whose life ends in disaster.That skeleton was fleshed out carefully, of course, in the novel. Tony Richardson, director of the movie, his scenarist, and a largely capable cast succeed only fitfully in delving into their principals' characters to solve the mysteries of love, sexuality and the perversity of behavior.But perhaps time and setting are to blame. The author's tormented hero and his circle were Germans of the nineteen-twenties, when the shocks of such goings-on might have been more dramatic than they are today. Richardson's current English and French protagonists are not ordinary supermarket citizens, either. As high-born and low-born society and swinger types they may be unusual, but one is not often convinced that their behavior is movingly real.One can understand that Nicol Williamson, as the wealthy London art dealer leading a boringly placid life with his cool, haughty wife, their young daughter, his country-squire brother-in-law and the effete art crowd, suddenly would be drawn to the enticements of Anna Karina, a luscious movie usherette, with her promise of amour.But, despite his blurted admission that this is his first love, it becomes increasingly difficult to appreciate his meek acceptance of her systematic conniving and her destruction of his life and fortune, an acceptance that continues even after he is made aware of her simultaneous tawdry affair with a designing, handsome. French lover (played unctuously and brutally by Jean-Claude Drouot). Perhaps there is some somber symbolism in our haples hero's being blinded in an auto accident after he first learns of the affair.But even in the desiccation of character one responds to the rising nobility of the hapless man as he senses his mistress's infidelity and proceeds to deal with her and her lover in his own, if blinded way.Mr. Williamson's sensitive delineation is largely restrained, but he matches that reserve with bursts of passion and despair that makes him a touchingly pitiable human being whose frailties are clearly projected.Miss Karina, beautifully seductive in explicit scenes in and out of several beds, makes a striking schemer whose lusts for money and her lover are properly rudimentary. And she makes it hard to understand why Mr. Williamson cannot fathom what is obvious to a moviegoer.Sian Phillips (Mrs. Peter O'Toole) is glacially patrician as Mr. Williamson's wife and mother of Amelia, played by Kate O'Toole, her actual daughter. Peter Bowles is properly bumbling as the brother-in-law.Mr. Richardson's individual scenes and nuances register better than the dramas as a whole. A psychedelic party in a posh town house, an argument in a Spanish motel, a grief-stricken reunion between husband and wife after the sudden death of their daughter, carry persuasiveness. But Mr. Williamson's discovery of his blindness; his sightless clambering on a villa's precipitous drainpipe in search of the lovers; his climactic shooting at his tormentors in the dark, are melodramatic devices as soapy as video's tear-jerkers.\"It's a judgment on me,\" he says dolefully of his daughter's death. Aside from the frothy dialogue and scenes reminiscent of day-time TV serials, this sardonic \"Laughter in the Dark\" does, indeed, make a fine amoral judgment on people caught in hopeless circumstances.Also on the program is \"Sunday Father,\" an 11-minute color subject produced and directed by Paul Leaf from an idea by Murray Schisgal, the playwright, in which Dustin Hoffman and Mr. Schisgal's 4-year-old daughter, Jane, offer a wordless but tender vignette of the brief visit in Central Park between a divorced father and his daughter.\n\nLAUGHTER IN THE DARK, screenplay by Edward Bond, based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov; directed by Tony Richardson and produced by Neil Hartley. A Woodfall Film presented by Gershwin Kastner-Les Films Marceau; distributed by Lopert Pictures Corporation. At the Little Carnegie Theater, 57th Street east of Seventh Avenue.
