        "text": "by Ryan J. Johnson\n\nStoicism seems to be everywhere these days â bestseller lists, email blasts, social media posts, corporate training sessions. Stoicism seems just another self-help trend.\n\nBut I think they all get it wrong. Stoicism is strange, very strange. Iâd even call it perverse. This perversity is what I show in my book, Deleuze, A Stoic.\n\nTo understand how strange it is, I draw upon Gilles Deleuzeâs taxonomy of ancient philosophical orientations. There are the pre-Socratics, thinkers of depth; the Platonists, thinkers of height, and Stoics, thinkers of surface. To this, we add the Aristotelians, thinkers of inwardness.\n\nFirst, the pre-Socratics, beginning with the legendary death of Empedocles. According to Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles âset out on his way to Etna; then, when he had reached it, he plunged into the fiery craters and disappeared, his intention being to confirm the report that he had become a god.â Putting his metaphysics into practice, Empedocles jumped into the volcano, aiming to sink his body back into the primordial elements of nature from which it was birthed. Deleuze characterizes other pre-Socratics as equally thinkers of depths, with the difference being the element selected as the deepest of the depths: Thalesâ water, Anaximenesâ air, Heraclitusâ fire, etc. This metaphysical orientation is a âturning below,â to the darkest matter, which what I call pre-Socratic subversion.\n\nPlatonism moves in the opposite direction, up towards the heights. In the Republic, Deleuze see the âphilosopher is a being of ascents,â of escaping the cave and climbing toward the light (LS 127). Even after escaping the cave, the Platonist ascends higher still, up the divided line, into the clouds, or even above. Way up there, Plato locates the truly true beings, the so-called Forms. Like the sun, situated at the apex of the world, the Form of the Good establishes a vertical ontological order and upright intelligibility. Socratic dialectics is an education in how to ascend to the heights, to follow the âflight of ideasâ (LS 128). I call this Platonic conversion.\n\nThough Deleuze skips Aristotle, I see in him a variation on Platonic verticality. With important caveats, Aristotelianism is generally oriented upward along a vertical chain of being. For Aristotle, every thing and every way of being depends on a primary substance, which orients Aristotle towards the âinsidesâ of things. Aristotle thus âtakes downâ what was, for Plato, above, placing it within the worldly particulars, and âbrings upâ the depths of the pre-Socratics. The result: interiority or height-within. Scholars call it hylomorphism. I call it Aristotelian inwardness.\n\nThe Stoics, however, are thinkers of surface. The Stoics do not simply return to the depths of primordial matter, nor do they erect a hierarchy reaching up into the heights, either above or within. Instead, they develop a new kind of ontological orientation â flatness. The Stoics are so strange.\n\nThough Deleuze sometimes suggests that it was Plato himself who provoked the overturning of Platonism, he also says that âthe Stoicsâ¦are the first to reverse Platonismâ (DR 68, 244; LS 7). But even this is not quite right. For the Stoics do not reverse Platonism. They pervert it, along with all their other philosophical predecessors. Stoicism initiates a philosophical perversion.\n\nDeleuze, A Stoic begins with these four ancient philosophical orientations:\n\nAnd it ends with five corresponding forms of ancient philosophical comedy (I add a fifth because one cannot speak of ancient comedy without including Diogenes):\n\nTo grasp the whole strange Stoic story, you must read the book. But to keep you interested, I will leave you with an aside on laughter that Deleuze made in a 1980 lecture.\n\nIn Spinoza, he says, there is âa species of very kind laughter, the laughter of a man who speaks freedom and power.â To me, this sounds very Stoic. For in Stoicism, freedom and power come together through a paradoxical notion most call the eternal return.\n\nOn the one hand, the Stoics think we are determined to act exactly as he have acted the last time we lived this life, and the infinitely many times before and after that. At the same time, however, there is the unavoidable imperative to act at this instant. We must act right now, right here, whether we want to or not. We cannot act and yet we cannot not act. Sounds perverse, doesnât it? But maybe also all too true?\n\nThe Stoic response to this impossible imperative of action is to laugh and yet to will exactly what happens as it happens â has and always will happen. Stoicism need not be so serious or self-helpy. Amor fati is, after all, a very funny, if perverted, affair. Rather than to gnash teeth, complain, or conjure up another, better world, beyond the one and only cosmos we must love and live, Stoic humor and its surface orientation tells us to affirm fate and crack up with laughter the whole time, on infinite repeat.\n\nThus every dawn, the Stoic egg cracks open, the yolk and the albumen spill out into the void, and everything burns up in cosmic fire. Then not long after, the world will begin again and again, the Stoics cracking up with laughter each and every time. It is pure philosophical perversity, and in the best possible way.\n\nWant to keep up to date on our latest Philosophy books?
