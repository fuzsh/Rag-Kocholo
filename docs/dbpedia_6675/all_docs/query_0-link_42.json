        "text": "Of all the movie genres to watch, there’s possibly nothing more comforting than picking one of the best rom-coms you know and settling into bed with a large bowl of popcorn, a face mask and a glass of wine. Rom-coms, who doesn't love them?\n\nLately, we have seen some amazing rom-coms, with Julia Roberts returning to her feel-good roots by teaming up with George Clooney for the romantic movie, Ticket to Paradise. And who can forget J.Lo’s turns as a heartbroken singer, who finds new love with a stranger (played by Owen Wilson) in the movie, Marry Me? Also, Kaley Cuoco had us all turning back the time to create the perfect man in Meet Cute. Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae also delighted us by bringing a romance between an African-American woman and a South Asian man to our Netflix screens in The Lovebirds.\n\nIf you usually rely on classics for your rom-com binges, then you’ll find the usual suspects in this list—The Meg Ryan classic When Harry Met Sally, Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock starring Two Weeks Notice as well as 10 Things I Hate About You (can you believe that film is 23 years old?!), Eat, Pray, Love and P.S I Love You. And, of course, there’s Definitely Maybe.\n\nIf you don't already know what it’s about (seriously, you're in for a treat), the movie stars Ryan Reynolds as a dad in the middle of divorce proceedings who tries to explain his past three relationships to his 11-year-old daughter. She must try and guess which is her mum.\n\nSome of the latest releases you may not have considered are also on the list, such as Emma, the modern reimagining of Jane Austen’s beloved romantic comedy starring Anya Taylor-Joy. How about Kaitlyn Dever in Rosaline, the comedic re-imagining of Shakespeare’s classic Romeo and Juliet? Plus, did you know that Netflix is also home to Intolerable Cruelty and Midnight in Paris? Rom-coms seriously don’t get any better than Owen Wilson alongside Rachel McAdams in a nostalgia-themed flick or George Clooney as a dapper lawyer trying to crush Catherine Zeta-Jones’s crippling divorce suit? It’s rom-com 101.\n\nSo settle in with one of the films from our round-up of the best rom-coms out there. Prepare to laugh and cry in equal measure…\n\nThis article first appeared on Glamour.co.uk"
