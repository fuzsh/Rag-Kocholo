        "text": "Beloved by the British public for her string of hit pre-war films, Gracie Fields' Lancastrian earthiness, impish humour and memorable songs have endeared her to many generations of fans. Love, Life & Laughter sees Gracie starring opposite '30s leading man John Loder in this decidedly working class spin on a Ruritanian romance.

This is no ordinary admirer, however, but the Crown Prince of Granau - who is so enamoured with Nellie's charms that he's compelled to break off his engagement and desert his fianc√©e.\n\nSpecial Feature:"
