        "text": "Why It's Swoon-Worthy: There are a slew of adaptations of Jane Austen's classic. We like this one for its earthy sensibility that still maintains the humor, wit, and (yes) sexual tension between Lizzie Bennet (Keira Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden).\n\nFavorite Quote: \"A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.\" —Mr. Darcy\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Dreamy Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy seduce each other with their minds and words while taking in a picturesque day and night in Vienna.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?\" —Celine\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: A big red Valentine to Los Angeles, and the dreamers who inhabit it, La La Land has gorgeous costumes, dizzying choreography and a singing, dancing Ryan Gosling. What's not to love?\n\nFavorite Quote: \"You could just write your own rules. You know, write something that's as interesting as you are.\" —Sebastian\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Get out the tissues and prepare for a good cry with this classic romance about two college students from radically different backgrounds who encounter profound love and heartbreaking tragedy.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\"—Jenny\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: That iconic rain-soaked kiss makes The Notebook a romantic classic, powered by the palpable chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, but what really brings on the tears is the relationship between their older characters, played by James Garner and director Cassavetes's mother Gena Rowlands.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday.\" —Noah\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Fast-talking, cocktail-swilling married detectives Nick and Nora Charles are the definition of #relationshipgoals.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"The important thing is the rhythm. Always have rhythm in your shaking. Now a Manhattan you shake to fox-trot time, a Bronx to two-step time, a dry martini you always shake to waltz time.\" — Nick Charles\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: If you prefer your romances of the tearjerker variety, this story of A-list musician Jackson and his protege-turned-lover Ally is a perfect fit. Starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, the latest retelling of this classic will make you want to hold the one you love close.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"All you got to do is trust me. That's all you got to do.\" - Jack\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Shakespeare's greatest love story, rendered in Baz Luhrmann's inimitably pop culture pastiche style—with teen heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio no less.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"And when I shall die, take him and cut him up in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will fall in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.\" —Juliet\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: This Disney classic is a winner with kids and grown-ups alike thanks to the all-star cast of charming characters and sing-along-worthy musical numbers that punctuate the story of an arrogant cursed prince and the book-loving peasant girl who teaches him that love is far more than skin-deep.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Tale as old as time, Song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the beast.\"—Mrs. Potts\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: This romantic caper defined the French New Wave, inspired a pixie-cut craze, and introduced us to Jean-Paul Belmondo as the coolest hunk in France as the Bogey-worshipping scamp Michel.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"When we talked, I talked about me, you talked about you, when we should have talked about each other.\" —Michel\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Who hasn't fantasized about erasing all the painful memories of lovers lost? The remarkable thing about Gondry's surreal fantasy is that it reminds us how indispensable and fundamental those memories and experiences are—they make us who we are.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004. Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies to make people feel like crap.\" —Joel\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Young, fresh-faced Aussie Heath Ledger faces off with saucy Julia Stiles in a classic '90s high school Shakespeare adaptation.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate it, I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.\" —Kat (Stiles)\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: The definitive screwball comedy features Clark Gable in his prime (those dimples!), hitchhiking with Claudette Colbert. It'll take you back to the good old days, when heiresses were sassy and reporters wore three piece suits and hats.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\nEllie Andrews: Aren't you going to give me a little credit?\n\nPeter Warne: What for?\n\nEllie Andrews: I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.\n\nPeter Warne: Why didn't you take off all your clothes? You could have stopped 40 cars.\n\nEllie Andrews: I'll remember that when we need 40 cars.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Part spoof of the fantasy genre, part straight-up fairytale romance, this classic follows Westley, a stableboy turned pirate as he fights to rescue his one true love before she's forced to marry a dastardly prince, all the with help of a ragtag group of hilarious sidekicks.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"As you wish.\"—Westley\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: The Looking creator's signature and sensitive style was first seen in this 48-hour love story between two British men.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"While you're projecting who you want to be ... this gap opens up between who you want to be and who you really are. And in that gap, it shows you what's stopping you becoming who you want to be.\" —Glen\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Possibly the most iconic romance movie of all time, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman star in this classic as star-crossed former lovers who meet up once again in Casablanca in the midst of WWII as she and her husband attempt to escape from the Nazis.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.\"—Rick\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: Rachel is in for more than she bargained for when she accompanies her boyfriend, Nick, to a friend's wedding in Singapore, only to discover Nick's family is extremely wealthy—and that everyone, from Nick's mother to the jilted socialites who want to snag him for themselves, think she doesn't belong with him.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\nRachel Chu: You have a cocktail dress in your trunk?\n\nPeik Lin Goh: I'm not an animal, Rachel.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: 25 years on, this famed film has gone from blockbuster to cultural joke to icon, but we defy you to watch Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet standing on the bow of that ship and not feel moved (or to get that earworm of a theme song out of your head.)\n\nFavorite Quote: \"I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.\"—Rose\n\nWhy It's Swoon-Worthy: This is the origin story of Channing Tatum, which does, yes, start in an all-male exotic dance revue (it's a strip club). But aside from the eye candy, this film boasts creative flair, a sweet love story between Mike (Tatum) and Paige (Cody Horn), and Matthew McConaughey as the unforgettable club MC, Dallas.\n\nFavorite Quote: \"Fact is, the law says you cannot touch … but I think I see a lot of lawbreakers up in this house tonight.\" —Dallas"
