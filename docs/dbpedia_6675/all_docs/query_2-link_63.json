        "text": "André Rieu is ready to blow you away with his brand new cinema concert ‘Power of Love’. From his picturesque hometown of Maastricht The King of the Waltz presents a must-see big screen spectacular. Accompanied by his world famous Johann Strauss Orchestra and a cast of hundreds this promises to be the music event of the summer by one of the world’s most prolific artists.\n\nIn a concert overflowing with passion André’s unique repertoire combines classical, musicals, pop and rock! You have to see it to believe it.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the historic Vrijthof square André will amaze you with iconic film scores, beautiful waltzes, tear jerking ballads and unexpected chart hits - music has the power to unite and this is a concert for all the family.\n\nMatthew Bourne’s magical dance production of Edward Scissorhands has carved a place in the hearts of audiences worldwide since its premiere in 2005. Based on the classic Tim Burton movie and featuring the hauntingly beautiful music of Danny Elfman and Terry Davies, Bourne and his New Adventures Company return to this witty, bittersweet story of an incomplete boy left alone in a strange new world. Filmed live in March 2024 at the Wales Millenium Centre, Cardiff, this ’visually arresting and ceaselessly inventive’ (★★★★★ Metro) production is ‘the perfect treat for all the family’ (★★★★★ The Times).\n\nIn a castle high on a hill lives Edward; a boy created by an eccentric inventor. When his creator dies he is left alone and unfinished with only scissors for hands until a kindly townswoman invites him to live with her suburban family. Can Edward find his place in the well-meaning community which struggles to see past his curious appearance to the innocence and gentleness within?"
