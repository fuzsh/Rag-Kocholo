        "text": "The saying ‘laughter is the best medicine’ has never been more appropriate. Not only does laughter bring people together, it can also trigger healthy physical and emotional changes in the body.\n\nWho hasn’t felt their spirits lift when they’ve found something amusing? Whether it’s as simple as belly laughing at a silly joke, or smiling and feeling warm as you remember a fond memory, laughter does more than just provide a break from difficult times. It can also provide courage, strength, and hope.\n\nHumour is often ignored as a way of improving mental and physical health, but there are many ways that it can do so. Below, we’ll explore some of the ways laughter and humour can improve mental and physical health, and look at how you can introduce more of it into your life.\n\nIt’s all too easy to focus on the negative elements of life, like news stories, encounters with negative people, or conversations that have made you feel unhappy. But, it’s possible to see the lighter side of life by accepting that there’s much beyond our control.\n\nThis acceptance can not only help you to let go of negativity and worry, but it can provide more headspace to focus on what you can control, and on the positives in your life.\n\nA good place to start when trying to break free from negativity and find a more positive path is to make a list of all the things that you’re most grateful for. Try to look at the list daily or weekly, and add to it as often as you can.\n\nOur articles, How to learn the skill of optimism and How practising gratitude can lead to a happier life, have plenty more tips on how to adopt a more positive mindset. You may also like to have a read of our mindfulness guide, or join a mindfulness meditation over on Rest Less Events.\n\nIf laughter isn’t something that comes naturally, or you don’t feel as though you have much to laugh about right now, why not start with a smile? Smiling can improve your mood and, like laughter, is contagious.\n\nRather than looking down when you’re out in public, try to smile at people around you. This can not only help you to feel more positive, but can make others around you feel good too.\n\nAccording to research from the University of Derby, recording a ‘Laughie’ can be a great way to help introduce humour and laughter into your life.\n\nA Laughie is a recording of your own laughter, which you then play back to yourself, prompting you to laugh. It’s suggested that you use the Laughie technique whenever you have a spare moment, whether you’re on your own or with others. There’s also no right or wrong place or way to listen to or record a Laughie.\n\nAlthough, it’s said that the best results are achieved when the laugh recording sounds natural and is listened to for at least a minute a day.\n\nRather than beating yourself up about any mistakes or personal shortcomings, try to laugh at them instead. Learning to laugh at yourself isn’t always easy, but it does have a positive impact. It can help you overcome feelings of embarrassment and embrace your imperfections.\n\nIt can also encourage you to take yourself less seriously, which can make life much more fun. We’re more likely to try new things and grab life with two hands if we’re prepared to laugh off the outcome – whether good or bad.\n\nYou can create opportunities to laugh by watching funny TV shows or movies. For some inspiration, you might want to check out our articles; 20 of the best comedy films of all time and 20 classic comedy series everyone should watch.\n\nThere are also amusing articles and videos on the internet that are quite easy to find – YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have plenty. Books can be full of humour too; Amazon has lots of options.\n\nHumour can be very personal, so it can take some trial and error to discover what sort of things really get you laughing. Remember that it’s not weird if someone else finds something funny and you don’t – you just have a different sense of humour, and that’s okay.\n\nTry to make time to laugh every day by incorporating it into your routine.\n\nLaughter doesn’t always have to be connected to a spontaneous You’ve Been Framed moment – you can also schedule time in your day (as little as 10 minutes will do) for something that you find amusing. This could be looking at funny videos or listening to an amusing podcast. The more frequently you’re able to laugh, the less effort it will take.\n\nIf you want to connect with your playful side, why not reflect on your childhood and see if there are things you enjoyed then that you can still do as an adult? Colouring or flying a kite, for example, remain fun activities for all ages.\n\nPlus, if you have grandchildren or other children in your life, why not try to spend more time with them? Children are experts at playing, not taking life too seriously, and laughing at the simplest of things – all of which can be infectious.\n\nConsider taking up laughter yoga. Laughter yoga is a mix of breathing techniques taken from yoga and laughing exercises.\n\nIt’s based on the idea that if you’re prepared to laugh (even if you don’t find anything funny), you’ll experience the psychological and physiological advantages that come with it.\n\nThe best way to practise laughter yoga is in a group, as eye contact can make laughter come much more naturally.\n\nIf you’d like to give laughter yoga a go, why not sign up to a session on Rest Less Events?\n\nBy exploring the health benefits of humour and laughing – such as a boosted immune system, improved memory, and better quality sleep – it’s understandable why the phrase, ‘laughter is the best medicine’, has become so popular. And, often, even the anticipation of laughter can have a positive impact on your mood.\n\nSo, whether it’s comedy shows, family and friends, funny videos, memes, or songs that make you laugh – try to engage with them as often as you can, especially during difficult times. Laughter and smiles aren’t just fleeting moments of happiness, they can be effective tools for coping with anxiety, fear, and grief. Plus, humour can break the ice, release tension, and bring people together.\n\nIf you feel short on reasons to crack a smile right now, why not have a read of our article; 20 happy facts to make your day a little better on the healthy mind section of our website?
