        "text": "Synopsis\n\nLost for nearly a century, this rediscovery offers a wonderful opportunity to fall under the spell of Betty Balfour, Britainâs âQueen of Happinessâ. Betty Balfour was Britainâs biggest star of the 1920s, so the discovery of one of her key films was a major event. Identified by archivists at EYE Filmmuseum in the Netherlands, this Dutch-language version is incomplete, with footage missing throughout the film. This version was painstakingly pieced together by the BFI National Archive's restoration team with new English intertitles. It restores a truly vivacious performance from Balfour, and adds to the knowledge of director George Pearson, a key figure in British cinema of whose films a bare handful survive.\n\nTelling the story of a pair of working class youngsters with big dreams â a cheery chorus girl and a serious writer â the film toys with expectations, blurring the boundaries of reverie and reality, tragedy and comedy.\n\nOfficial Selection BFI London Film Festival 2019 - Archive Special Presentation - Restoration World premiere"
