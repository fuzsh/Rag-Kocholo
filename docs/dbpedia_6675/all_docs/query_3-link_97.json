        "text": "CITY OF LAUGHTER, by Temim Fruchter\n\nLike desire and secrets, “laughter is no controlled substance,” Temim Fruchter writes in “City of Laughter,” her brainy and richly textured debut novel. “It goes where it wants to go.” Grief, too, is hard to contain. In the wake of both her father’s death and a difficult breakup, Fruchter’s 32-year-old heroine, Shiva Margolin, attempts to unravel 100 years of tangled generational trauma in order to find inner peace. The more complicated fate she ultimately embraces makes this unabashedly queer Jewish family story a new take on our uncertain age.\n\nWhile earlier generations of her family may have accepted the dictum that “if something is closed, it is meant to stay that way,” Shiva rejects her mother Hannah’s threadbare wisdom. Embracing a new identity as a queer woman, Shiva takes a second look at her comfortable if confined life working at a nonprofit and living in Brooklyn.\n\nNurturing the seeker and storyteller in herself, Shiva embraces these qualities in others as well. “When her friends wanted their stories reflected back to them, they looked for that reflection in one another, telling and deeply listening,” she notes. This is unlike stoic, silent Hannah, who guards her family’s secrets.\n\nOpenness is exactly what Shiva needs. “They gave each other generosity and kindness as the generations couldn’t or hadn’t been allowed,” she says of her friends. Shiva feels “precious, glittering, funny, found” in their company as a proud, single queer femme. It’s a description that could also be used to describe newly discovered photos of Shiva’s late grandmother, Syl. She was a fervent believer and a strict parent to Hannah, but her sartorial flair revealed a certain jouissance.\n\nFruchter deftly braids together the narratives of four generations of women in Shiva’s family, all bound by the mystery of Judaism and queer passion. The novel skillfully moves back and forth between her contemporary characters and their ancestors from Ropshitz, Poland. Among these forebears were messengers, badchanim, healers and spirits, and they anchor the book in a place where “laughter is fundamental” yet regimented. In Ropshitz, “laughter can be sacred or it can be evil, but it is not usually possible for it to be both.” Discerning the difference between the two preoccupies and divides the town’s inhabitants. This thin line between profanity and joy carries into the present.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
