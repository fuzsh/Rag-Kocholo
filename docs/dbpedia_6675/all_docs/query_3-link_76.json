It is the patriarchal order, for Matovic, that should be “blamed” for this kind of humor. This account, however, tells us little about who was consuming the “Sweedie” films and what meanings audiences attached to this character, and an abstraction such as “patriarchy” sheds little light on the specific discursive context that made this character funny (Matovic, Margareta, “Swedish-American Women in Lake View,” in Peasant Maids–City Women: From the European Countryside to Urban America, ed.
