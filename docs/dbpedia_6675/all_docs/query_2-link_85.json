Hosted by Anisha Padukone and Dr. Shyam Bhat, this series began with an intimate and powerful discussion on mental health, transformative life lessons, career milestones, and much more.\n\nThe episode promises honesty, inspiration, and invaluable insights. Whether you sought to learn, laugh, or gain a fresh perspective, this conversation offers it all.\n\nPooja Mehta\n\nI have lived with schizoid anxiety since I was 13 years old. Every time I have a panic attack, I hear voices in my head telling me that nobody loves me, that I'm worthless, that I should hurt myself or kill myself. Three times I have tried to follow through on their commands, attempting suicide that was (thankfully) unsuccessful."
