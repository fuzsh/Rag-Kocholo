At least, that’s what it felt like in the 2010s: Your straight-up, stupid slapstick comedy may have gone the way of the Marx Brothers, but it seemed like every drama, superhero movie, and horror flick couldn’t help injecting in some levity and jokes. Even Manchester by the Sea was funny! (At times. ) A lot of people these days use laughter to process tragedy, which explains why so many comedy-dramas were made over the past decade. See: Eighth Grade, Lady Bird, The Big Sick, and even Best Picture winner Birdman.\n\nBut fear not comedy purists, for there were plenty of joke-driven comedies out there. Simply take a look at Booksmart, Bridesmaids, The Nice Guys, The Death of Stalin, and What We Do in the Shadows. For those seeking out a more mannered take on comedy, seek no further than Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Favourite, or Love & Friendship. And, of course, who can forget the ever-durable rom-com, represented here by the likes of Crazy Rich Asians or Love, Simon?\n\nWhatever the style, or budget, we took every comedy movie from the decade and then ranked them by Adjusted Tomatometer, a formula which weighs multiple factors, including a movie’s release year and its number of reviews. Speaking of, each movie needed a minimum of 80 reviews for consideration. And now, it’s time open wide and laugh with joy with the 50 Best Comedy Movies of the 2010s! —Alex Vo\n\nThe 200 Best Movies of the 2010s | The 50 Best Animated Movies of the 2010s\n\nThe 50 Best Comedies of the 2010s | The 50 Best Horror Movies of the 2010s\n\nThe 50 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 2010s | The 50 Best Superhero Movies of the 2010s\n\n#50\n\nThe Sessions (2012) 91%\n\n#50\n\nAdjusted Score: 100452%\n\nCritics Consensus: Tender, funny, and touching, The Sessions provides an acting showcase for its talented stars and proves it's possible for Hollywood to produce a grown-up movie about sex.\n\nSynopsis: Though a childhood bout with polio left him dependent on an iron lung, Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes) maintains a career...
