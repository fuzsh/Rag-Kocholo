        "meta_description": "This introduction presents an overview of key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book explores the interactions of comedy and drama within a group of significant and influential films released during 1990s. It discusses several contemporary British films, focusing upon the experiences of British-Asian and African-Caribbean characters and their efforts to feel 'at home' in Western and British society. The book explores the emergence of romantic comedy as a popular genre in 1990s British cinema, and includes case studies of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually. It investigates the ways in which humour is deployed for dramatic and emotional effect in the context of scenarios dealing with such seemingly non-comic subjects as mass unemployment, failed or uneasy relationships, bitter family disputes, or instances of racial tension and conflict in British society.",
