        "meta_description": "Love, Life and Laughter tells the story of a pair of working class youngsters with big dreams – a cheery chorus girl and a serious writer. The film toys with our expectations, blurring the boundaries of reverie and reality; tragedy and comedy. Directed by George Pearson, the film was considered lost for many years until in March 2014 when a copy was discovered in an old Dutch cinema.",

        "text": "Much sought after having being on the BFI's Missing Believed Lost and Most Wanted lists, this film finally surfaced in the Netherlands in 2014 and tonight was the first public screening following three years of restoration.\n\nI've become quite a fan of Betty Balfour, who was one of Britain's biggest stars in the silent era. Here, as the poor chorus girl who dreams of wealth and fame, she's perky, sparky, and rather delightful as she commands the camera, smiles, looks, dances, fondles objects (a balloon takes the place of an imaginary baby), and becomes a part of the melodramatic fiction of the writer upstairs in her tenement.\n\nThe other players are of less interest: Harry Jonas as \"Boy\" is lacking…\n\nThe optimism of the young people today is like the air in my balloons... The more optimism, the higher they go. Too much optimism... BANG!!\n\nBrimming with life and with peppy, manic energy courtesy of Betty Balfour, Love, Life and Laughter's nested narrative slips between fantasy and reality, into Squibs' daydreams and the 'icy dramas' The Boy is writing. ('Is that the story? I hope there's a lot of love and suicide in it.')\n\nI really enjoyed the inexhaustible exuberance of Balfour's Squibs, less so Harry Jonas' performance opposite her as a tortured writer. You have to suspect he was hired for the look, the only one he does.\n\nAlso enjoyed: the nosy, bickering middle aged landlords; the omnipresence of…\n\nScreened for the first time in 96 years following an extensive search, a fascinating discovery and a painstaking restoration of the nitrate film, Love, Life and Laughter was a wonderful addition to the London Film Festival and an important moment in cinema history.\n\nAlthough the name Betty Balfour isn't widely known today, she was a huge star of cinema in the silent era: dubbed \"Britain's Queen of Happiness\", she was best known for her character 'Squibs', who appeared in a series of movies directed by George Pearson. It was the Squibs movies that shot her to fame, but it was far from all she did. Throughout her twenty-five year career, she played a variety of characters and roles, and showed…"
