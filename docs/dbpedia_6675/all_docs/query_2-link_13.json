        "text": "1923\n\nWatchlist\n\nBritish screen comedienne Betty balfour took a breather from her popular Squibs comedies to star as Tiptoes, a lowly chorus girl in this melodrama with an uncharacteristic (for Balfour) unhappy ending. But the charming Miss Balfour could do nothing wrong in those early years and the film was both a critical and popular success, one reviewer going as far as to compliment producer-director George Pearson \"upon a production for the artistic equal of which one must go to the best French and Swedish pictures.\" High praise indeed!"
