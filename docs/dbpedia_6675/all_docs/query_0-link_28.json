        "text": "It’s important to watch a feel-good, happy film once in a while, whether it's to cheer you up from the grey weather outside, a stressful day at work or just because you're in need of a good, old giggle.\n\nWhether it's a romantic comedy like Jerry Maguire or La La Land to watch while tucked up in bed, or animated films like Up, Soul and Enchanted to accompany you while you sit with a takeaway in your pyjamas, there's nothing quite like a film to lift your spirits.\n\nAs we all know, life is better with cheer, laughter and a bit of a singalong.\n\nIn need of a mood booster? Here's our top picks of happy films that'll do just the ticket:\n\n1) The Sound of Music, 1965\n\nA young novitiate, Maria, is sent by her convent in 1930s Austria to become a governess, and to a sizeable family, too.\n\nShe's enters the home of a widowed naval officer, Baron von Trapp, who has seven children with different personalities, who present more than a challenge for her in her first few days on the job.\n\nAs Maria navigates the home, immense emotions, tantrums, laughter, joy and despair of the family, she soon finds herself at a crossroads in life. Expect a singalong and lots of laughter.\n\n2) Bride Wars, 2009\n\nFriendship woes and rivalry is at the centre of this bridal drama, which sees Devil Wears Prada alum Anne Hathaway and How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' Kate Hudson portray longtime pals who face the ultimate test of loyalty.\n\nBackstabbing, trickery and sabotage collide in a wildly entertaining showdown between the pair who dreamt of their wedding day from when they were just little girls.\n\n3) This Is 40, 2012\n\nA follow on from Knocked Up, this film sees a married couple grapple with the reality of entering a new decade - their 40s.\n\nAs they approach their milestone birthday, we learn that their kids hate each other, their businesses are falling short and they are close to loosing their house.
