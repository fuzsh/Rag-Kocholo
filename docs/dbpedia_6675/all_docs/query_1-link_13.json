        "text": "For as long as I can remember it has been drilled into me that to get what you want, you must work for it. Put in the time. Invest in yourself. Jobs? I’ve applied for them, prepared for the inevitable “do you have any specific questions about the role?” Yes, yes I do! Not getting a desired A-Level grade? I studied harder, turned down trips to the cinema (slash anything that advertised fun), re-took the exam and achieved a better result. Someone shared a quote on Instagram the other day, from the actress Lauren Bacall, that the world doesn’t owe you a damn thing. Of course, she’s so right, I thought, whilst happily ignorant to my erasure of due diligence when it comes to applying this to matters of the heart.\n\nBecause, well, pragmatism has little to do with love. It is all feeling, right? Matter over mind; a magnetic pull that you have no control over. In other words, it just sort of happens – freeing in a way, lets you off the hook. (Important to note that my understanding of such connections has so often been coloured in with fantasy over the years: fairy tales, films, books, songs…). Yet, the older I get the more lost than found I am in this category. Maybe I’m missing a trick. So – in a spirited bout of contemplation over the future – I was curious (and, yes, also somewhat dubious) if a love coach could proffer a dose of emotional intelligence. One of the UK’s “most successful”, no less, according to The Times, Persia Lawson.\n\n“I sort of feel like I’m on a date,” I laugh nervously, sitting virtually opposite Lawson, author of Love is Coming: How to Find Real Love in a Superficial World. After a few minutes of Zoom small talk, we dive swiftly into the “compatibility call” (a taster session to unpick where I’ve been, where I’m at, and where I might be headed on the intimacy Venn diagram). First question: point blank, “on a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to make a big change in your love life?”\n\nLong pause. “Halfway there, probably five.” I come up with a range of half-formed reasons as to why, which gradually become clearer over the course of our conversation.\n\nNext up: what is the main challenge to your love life? This is where the sum of my personal history adds up to trepidation. I fall in love rarely. But when I do it happens swiftly; all-consumingly. I am very good at that part. The falling, the longing – it’s the landing that throws me into a neurotic spiral. It’s like I can see this seemingly perfect picture I have created demolishing slowly. I become increasingly anxious and needy and seek constant reassurance (in short: the antithesis of the strong-willed, self-sufficient person so active in early courtship). And that rarely feels good.\n\nDo I chase the immediate highs so much that they can only be countered by extreme lows? “It’s more the not knowing what’s actually going to be good for me long-term, rather than short-term,” I reply. “I get sucked into the romance very quickly…” Mulling over my (sparse) romantic CV involving musicians, artists and writers, in the process. She compares the personalities of a sailor and farmer. The latter, loyal and reliable but often fearful of risk; the former a person who seeks adventure and freedom, yet prone to fickle-mindedness.\n\nThe assessment suggests that I straddle the two extremes. “The key is we want to harness both of these energies,” Lawson urges. “First within yourself.” My latent “neediness” is, then, compounded by the fact I intensely stifle the farmer side of my psyche with the sailors I so often find myself drawn to. I ask for almost nothing. Follow suit and, somewhere along the way, feel at the mercy of someone else’s narrative. I don’t need to meet your family, that’s fine. No worries. We can walk at your pace, that’s fine. Everything is fine, until it’s quite clearly not. And that’s, to an extent, largely on me. I’ve never been very good at reading directions so it gets outsourced. A script that has bled into many a relationship and, now unavoidably, in need of a re-write.\n\nThere are other things, too. Sadder things. Exploring the crevices of exiled romances that didn’t work out (a recent-ish one, specifically, that felt at the time prematurely punctured). She asks me if she could wave a magic wand where would I see myself, with someone, in five years’ time? Oh god. There it is again: panic. I see where this is all heading, and my recent suspicions are all but confirmed prior to the important “diagnosis” section of our session.\n\n“The issue here is the inner conflict within yourself,” she says. “With love it’s like ‘I really want [it] but I’m terrified of commitment.’ That’s why you keep going for people who may live somewhere else, or someone who maybe is unsure of what they want or settling down. Water seeks its own level. We always attract people who mirror what’s going on within us.”\n\nSince the pandemic started, Lawson has seen an influx of clients – ranging from “those who have never had a relationship, or been single for a decade, in their sixties, teenagers, married women who want to do an inventory of their love life.” Of course, the goalpost looks different for everybody – marriage and children are still deeply ambivalent to me, for instance – but the modus operandi to facilitate becoming more aware of our endeavours in this area of our lives is unchanging. It begins with you. And for anyone curious about love coaching, Lawson says one should prepare for a journey of self-examination and healing. “It’s like starting your own business, there’s going to be ups and downs [and] tears,” she says. “For some people it doesn’t have to be dramatic. But it’s all worth it.”\n\nLike the author and feminist bell hooks wrote, “to approach romantic love from a foundation of care, knowledge and respect actually intensifies romance.” Allow it to flourish into something real and, more significantly, sustainable.\n\nReassuringly, for someone like me who doesn’t bode well with too many rules placed upon them, Lawson’s approach is more intuitive than it is definitive. Because in countless ways it would be remiss to remove the exciting mysteries contained over the course of love. Of the endless wonder in getting to know another person. It is just far more fruitful a deed to understand ourselves, the significant other, more."
