        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nIn Life, Love, Laughter: Celebrating Your Existence, one of the twentieth century's greatest spiritual teachers shares how humor and wisdom strengthens our lives.\n\nIn this collection of reflections, Osho's encouraging and loving stories go far beyond the usual chicken-soup fare. Life, Love, Laughter establishes a new genre of introspective text stripped of all platitudes and clichés, and absolutely in tune with the realities of the twenty-first century. In this artful work, Osho mixes entertainment and inspiration, ancient Zen stories and contemporary jokes to help us to find love, laughter, and ultimately, happiness.\n\nFeaturing an original talk by Osho on DVD, you'll experience his direct insight and wit straight from the source. Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the \"1000 Makers of the 20th Century\" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nIn this collection of reflections, Osho's inspiring and loving stories go far beyond the usual chicken-soup fare.
