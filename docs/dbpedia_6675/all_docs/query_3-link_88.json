        "text": "“Time flies like the wind. Fruit flies like bananas.”\n\nThat declaration by Marx (Groucho, not Karl) is, in my humble opinion, the most brilliantly funny (and incisively truthful) statement ever uttered by a human being. You are free to differ, of course. What tickles the funny bone of one does not tickle the funny bones of all. This is especially true within a nuclear family unit.\n\nAn avowed Marxist, my youngest son cued up the classic comedy “A Day at the Races” last Sunday night for our evening viewing. I was delighted. His sainted mother was less enthralled, but she grinned and bore (beared?) it. Well, she didn’t actually grin, but she was bored by it, enduring the madcap high jinks until her bedtime blessedly arrived. The Marx Brothers are a bit too rich in slapstick silliness for her liking. That I understand. I am, however, shocked that Victoria is not amused by Monty Python, given that her mother was British.\n\nAlas, humor is in the eye and ear of the beer-holder, so to speak, but there is plenty of comedic common ground around our shack and it’s a wonderful thing indeed to share some communal yuks.\n\nAlong with TV shows such as “Modern Family,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “Malcolm in the Middle,” we all like Wes Anderson’s charmingly droll film “Moonrise Kingdom” about two 12-year-olds who fall in love and run away together on a beautiful island off the coast of New England. Michael Keaton’s zany Chicago gangster movie spoof “Johnny Dangerously” is a favorite, as is a host of animated wonderment, such as “Finding Nemo,” “Chicken Run,” the Wallace and Gromit shorts (particularly “The Wrong Trousers”) and the recent “Shaun The Sheep Movie.” Watching Will Ferrell’s hilarious “Elf” is a family tradition that annually kicks off our holidays with a cup of mirth.\n\nAmong my favorite childhood memories is being attracted to the living room by the sound of my father chortling at Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. I fell in love with them all. My family routinely gathered around the tube for “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and “All in the Family.” (My mother, who resembled Edith Bunker, used to playfully screech “Coming Archie!” at my father whenever he requested something and she took great delight in the frumpy Python character Mrs. Crump-Pinnet, a name she cattily used to describe my persnickety Aunt Miriam.)\n\nTime, of course flew, like the wind and I passed it all on to my offspring along with The Little Rascals, “The Honeymooners” and classic films by Woody Allen (my kids love “Sleeper,” “Bananas,” “Take The Money and Run” and “Love and Death”), Mel Brooks (“Young Frankenstein,” “Silent Movie”) and albums by The Firesign Theatre from my teen years (“Everything You Know Is Wrong,” “I Think We’re All Bozos on This Bus”). My kids in turn have imparted the joys of Wes Anderson movies, the TV shows “Portlandia” and “Arrested Development,” and the Web-based “Homestar Runner” cartoons. Their mother introduced me to the brilliant family sitcom “The Middle.” Not all of this fare leaves every inhabitant of our domicile helplessly rolling on the floor, mind you, but we usually find some chuckles we all can share.\n\nAs Woody Allen once said, “I’m grateful for laughter except when milk comes out of my nose.”"
