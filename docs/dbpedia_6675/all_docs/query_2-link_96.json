        "text": "[quiet intro music plays]\n\n[city sounds hum]\n\nThis is a doormat that Don sent us.\n\nYou know, normally people just send The Newharts,\n\nbut of course he had to have his name on it.\n\nBest friends with the Rickles.\n\nEven toward the end, the last, the last week\n\nor 10 days, it was,\n\nKeep my name alive.\n\nAnd that's what we're doing today.\n\nWe're keeping his name alive.\n\nSomebody called me up and they said,\n\nLook, Don Rickles is looking for a best friend\n\n[audience laughs]\n\n[Rickles laughs]\n\nand none of us wanna do it. Would you?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nAnd I said, How long?\n\nThey said, A year at the most.\n\n[Rickles and audience laugh]\n\n[lively piano music plays]\n\n[Interviewer] And that, that's you guys at Disneyland?\n\nDisneyland. We went to,\n\nthat's I think the Matterhorn behind us.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nAnd we were with Mickey,-\n\nMickey Mouse.\n\n[Newhart] With our kids.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nAnd I remember [chuckles] Mickey came up\n\nto Don and I and said,\n\nYou know how\n\nGod damn hot it is in this, in this suit?\n\nWe gotta walk around in the God damn suit all day long.\n\nWe're going, Mickey, Mickey, the kinder. Sh, Mickey.\n\nOh, you can't believe it, the kids grab you.\n\nYou can't believe where these kids grab ya.\n\nMickey, Mickey.\n\nYes.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nI find this a little incongruous.\n\nYour best friend is Bob Newhart.\n\nI, I, I think another genius\n\nand one of the great comedians of all time,\n\nand I only say it's a little incongruous\n\nbecause your, your styles,\n\nyou're both extremely nice, decent people in real life.\n\nThank you.\n\nBut your styles are so different.\n\nWell, yeah. Bob's a, a brainy kind of comedian\n\nand I'm a kind of guy that gets laughs.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nSam, there's not much I can say.\n\nYou're an all around built-in dynamite little talent.\n\nYou've told me this time and time again.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nThe way you can improve your show is to get a little taller,\n\nget rid of the funny eye, and get yourself a good job.\n\n[audience and Davis laugh]\n\nHey, that's what I do, my friends. I laugh at people.\n\nI laugh at blacks, whites, purples. I laugh at all.\n\nMy whole humor. I came this far in America. Why?\n\n'Cause I laugh at what the heck we are.\n\nThat's what we have to laugh at.\n\nYou're a black man, right?\n\nI took a guess.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nI'll tell you this.\n\nI found Don just fascinating as opposed to what I did.\n\nI don't know how many of you men know this,\n\nbut the cod fish holds the record\n\nfor the most Japanese tonnage sunk-\n\n[audience chuckles]\n\nbeing comprised of five freighters\n\nand 15 aircraft carriers.\n\nA truly enviable record.\n\nUnfortunately, they were sunk in 1954.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nHowever, it stands as the\n\nlargest peace time tonnage ever sunk.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nThe first album went to number one,\n\nthen the second album went to number one,\n\nand the first album went to number two for like,\n\nI'm gonna say 30 weeks.\n\n[Interviewer] And you won like the Grammys\n\nfor the record, right?\n\nI won three, I won the Best New Artist,\n\nAlbum of the Year, and Spoken Word.\n\nThey didn't even have a comedy category at that time.\n\n[Narrator] Yeah.\n\nWell this one, people wonder why I keep this.\n\nWhile the sound of your music has enthralled millions.\n\n[interviewer laughs]\n\nSo they obviously followed my career.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nI had a weird kind of career.\n\nI had like a singer's career\n\nbecause I made that comedy album\n\nand then,\n\nGod forbid, I didn't do\n\nthe routines from the comedy album,\n\n'cause that's what they, I had,\n\nthey were like hit songs\n\nthat I was doing.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nAnd I'm sure Frank,\n\nwhen I beat on Frank for Album\n\nof the Year, I'm sure, well, who beat me out?\n\nWell, this young kid, nobody knows who he is,\n\nhas a comedy record and he talks on the phone.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\nI need this, Frank, I need a shot. Do me a favor.\n\nGimme a break. I got relatives living in Jersey.\n\nNot for long.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\n[upbeat jazz music plays]\n\nEveryone knows that I kid about all peoples.\n\nI'd like everybody to know\n\nthere's no discrimination in Las Vegas.\n\nThey take everybody's money.\n\nWe were in Vegas, I forget where you were playing,\n\nbut Don, of course, was playing the Sahara in those days.\n\nMy wife is a very warm person, very retiring,\n\nbut she met Ginnie Newhart, who's a doll\n\nand kind of outgoing.\n\nAnd they met and just hit it off like crazy.\n\nSo, I get this call one day and it's Barbara,\n\nand she said, We're here in Vegas\n\nand can we get together?\n\nAnd we were in Vegas together.\n\nI was in the main room and Don...\n\n[audience laughs]\n\n[Newhart laughs]\n\nTrue.\n\nAnd Don was in the lounge. So Ginnie called Barbara\n\nand she said, Why don't we get together\n\nwith Don and Barb?\n\n[Donahue] And you were married, both of you,\n\nat the time?\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nNo, we were single working the area.\n\n[Donahue] Alright.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nAnd Don at that time was still one of the big spenders,\n\ninvited us to have dinner at the cafeteria at the Sahara.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nWe went and we met them at the coffee shop at the Sahara.\n\nAnd Don was a pussycat.\n\nAnd as we're leaving, we were going\n\nto see Don's third show in the lounge.\n\nAnd Ginnie said, Ginnie said to me, she said,\n\nHe's such a sweet man.\n\nHe's such a lovely man.\n\nI said, Well, honey, it may be\n\na little different once\n\nwe get into the lounge.\n\n[audience chuckles] So,\n\nwe got in the lounge, sat down, and he said,\n\nI wanna introduce very good friends of mine,\n\nthe stammering idiot from Chicago, Bob Newhart,\n\nand his hooker wife from Bayonne.\n\n[audience laughs] [Richgels laughs]\n\n[Newharts laugh]\n\nAnd her jaw dropped.\n\n[Ginnie chuckles]\n\nI said, I tried to tell you.\n\n[Newharts laugh]\n\nAnd it was love ever since,\n\n[Newhart] Ever since.\n\n[lively brass music plays]\n\n[Tim Newhart] I mean they're, they're standups,\n\nbut they're completely different styles,\n\nso it wasn't threatening is my guess.\n\nMy dad was, you know, he's a monologist.\n\nUncle Don was just sort of stream of consciousness.\n\nand Rickles was never gonna do my dad's shtick.\n\n[Audience Member] Considering your brand of humor,\n\nhave you ever had any lawsuits?\n\nNo. Are you planning to make trouble?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nYou're a Jew, you gotta be.\n\nWith that nose, if you're not, you're an eagle.\n\nI'll tell you this.\n\n[audience laughs and applauds]\n\nWould you rise? Japanese?\n\nNo, Chinese.\n\nChinese? Sure, since the war they're all Chinese.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nIf you're meeting Don for the first time,\n\nhe would get something on you right away.\n\n[Interviewer] Mm.\n\nYour beard, whatever, which prevented you from saying,\n\nHey, Baldy, hey, you're a little overweight.\n\nSo, now you're on this offensive.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nIs this too fast, Ronnie?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nAnyway, he's sitting there looking at the program going,\n\nWhere does it say he makes fun of me?\n\nWhere does it say that?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nIt's only a joke. Mrs. Reagan. Ha-ha.\n\n[whoosh sound plays]\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nIt was a badge of honor to be attacked by Don.\n\n[Narrator] Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYou know. Did ya hear what he called me.\n\nHe called me a hockey puck.\n\n[all chuckle]\n\nIsn't that great?\n\nI don't know about you in school.\n\nYou went to Nebraska University, right?\n\n[Carson] Yes, I did go to University.\n\nWhat school did you go to Ed?\n\n[McMahon] Boston College. Who cares?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nHe had that skill that, that ability\n\nto just turn it\n\n[hands smack]\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nback on.\n\nI think it was defensive.\n\nI being a frightened guy, and to this day\n\nI'm frightened when they say-\n\nAre you Don?\n\nI swear it. Yeah.\n\nYou know it's a fool that walks out on the stage\n\nand says, I'm there, you know, every night you know,\n\nI'd say, Gee,- Don't believe anybody.\n\nwill they laugh.\n\n[loud brass music plays]\n\nI think to be on,\n\nthat's gotta be terrifying,\n\nand I think they got through it together.\n\nBut it's see, it's apples and oranges.\n\nWhat Bob does, I certainly couldn't do,\n\nand he certainly can't do what I do,\n\nalthough he attempts it quietly,\n\nbut I can't do that.\n\nIt was a wonderful treat\n\nto see Milton Berle backstage come up to me\n\nand go, Hello, son. I'm Milton Berle.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nI love Milton. You were my idol when I was a kid.\n\nNow I'm getting shock treatments.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nIs he, is he laughing? Take a look.\n\n[audience continues to laugh]\n\n[Interviewer] Did you like roasting?\n\nNo, it's not my nature, but yeah,\n\nI did quite a few\n\nof Dean's shows,\n\nand then I did some of the roasts.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the funniest psychiatrist\n\nI know, Mr. Bob Newhart.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\n[Narrator] But you roasted Don.\n\n[Newhart] Oh yeah.\n\n[Narrator] What was it like to get a chance\n\nto do what he does?\n\nHeaven.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nDon is is my best, my best friend,\n\nwhich just gives you some idea\n\nof the difficulty I have in making friends.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nBut Don has not done that well in television.\n\nHe's had four series now.\n\nThe last one, a couple of Don's, received\n\na minus-four Nielsen rating.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\n[Newhart chuckles]\n\nThis means not only was no one watching,\n\nbut several people without TV sets had heard about the show\n\nand said if they got one they wouldn't watch it.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nThe basic thing in friendship with all the comedy,\n\nI adore him and, and I know he adores me.\n\nAnd the, the great thing about it's that\n\nour values are the same.\n\nWe believe in the same things,\n\nand we laugh at the same things.\n\nWell I think, you know, they were both family men\n\nin a way that comics really weren't, you know.\n\nThey were so in love with their wives.\n\nMy parents were married 50 years\n\nand, you know, the idea of cheating,\n\nyou know, Bob or my dad, never in a million years.\n\nAnd they were actually like prude, you know,\n\nlike my parents or Ginnie told me a story where\n\nthey were at a party.\n\nIt was like a tea party. It was swingers.\n\nThey were smoking, you know, weed,\n\nand my parents, as soon as they saw that,\n\nand Bob, they were like, we're outta here.\n\nYou know, I remember once they had like a dinner,\n\nit was just gonna be the four of them,\n\nand Sinatra was gonna join.\n\nAnd my dad said to whoever,\n\nDid you ever think in your wildest dreams you would get\n\nto the point in your life where you would try to figure out\n\nhow to not have dinner with Frank Sinatra?\n\n[both laugh]\n\nBut that was it. They wanted it just, it needed\n\nto be the core, you know?\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah. That's what they loved.\n\n[Rickles] Well, we both have children,\n\nand I'm proud of them.\n\nAnd Bob has the same,\n\nwell I don't wanna speak for Bob,\n\nbut I can say knowing his kids,\n\n'cause I'm Uncle Don and vice versa,\n\nand he's Uncle Bob, and our kids are very well adjusted.\n\nBut that's, our kids grew up together.\n\n[playful music plays]\n\n[Mindy] We always traveled with my dad when\n\nhe went on the road with my mother, my brother.\n\nAnd the same with the Newharts.\n\nI mean, they really tried to make it\n\nas normal as they could.\n\nAnd so that's why Larry Rickles was my best friend.\n\nThe Rickles kids and the Newhart kids,\n\nwe were just always together.\n\n[Reporter] Tell me about your summer plans this summer.\n\nYou and Newhart going away?\n\nYeah, we're gonna go down to the beach\n\nand attack a lifeguard.\n\nOn the sea of time\n\nwe will sing along Broadway.\n\nDance.\n\nMy parents and the Newharts.\n\nthey always had to be together.\n\nI was like, when I grow up,\n\nI wanna have another couple when I'm married\n\nthat are best friends.\n\nWe'll travel with them and have so much fun.\n\nHere we are. Hey.\n\nOnce again downtown LA.\n\nI've got, you get in there,\n\nand let me take a picture of you.\n\nThe area has to be fixed up a little bit,\n\nbut we're working on it.\n\nNo matter where we went, we'd go to Hong Kong.\n\nThey'd say, Oh, we have the sushi [speaks gibberish],\n\nand we have the wanton [speaks gibberish]`.\n\nAnd I said, Yeah, whatever Barbara says.\n\nWhat are you gonna have, Bob?\n\nDo you have spaghetti bolognese?\n\nThe man has no idea where the hell he is.\n\nI like bolognese.\n\n[Bob laughs]\n\nHe tends to exaggerate.\n\nWe go to Germany, do have spaghetti bolognese.\n\nThat was his favorite dish.\n\nOh, this is Don with the, the kids in Thailand.\n\nThese are my children.\n\nDuring the war, I stopped off here for about 10 minutes.\n\n[family laughs]\n\nThis is Lam, this is Jung.\n\n[family laughs]\n\nAnd I'm Eddie.\n\nEddie.\n\nYes, later, later.\n\nLater, later [laughing]\n\n[family laughs]\n\nBob and my mother were very meticulous,\n\nand very like OCD, and they handled everything.\n\nAnd Ginnie and my dad were just like, whatever. You know?\n\n[Narrator] Yeah.\n\nI just wanna have fun. So it sort of balanced.\n\n[Ginnie] Barbara would. she'd do all the,\n\nyou know, planning.\n\nYou know, we have to visit this,\n\nwe have to do this, we have to do that.\n\nDon and I were just along for the ride.\n\n[guys laugh]\n\nI said to Barbara one time, I went\n\nto change some money at the airport,\n\nand they were sitting in the terminal.\n\nI said, Barbara, if we got on a plane\n\nand flew home right now,\n\nthey would still be here two years from now.\n\n[all laugh]\n\nNow I got a lovely wife.\n\nWe just came back from Paris and she shopped.\n\nShe has a black belt in shopping.\n\n[man laughs]\n\nAh. She went bananas.\n\nThe woman never looked up. The bags were like this.\n\nShe never looked up once.\n\n[Interviewer] Nothing.\n\nValentino thinks she's part of the family.\n\nDon had to marry somebody like Barbara.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause she was the organizer.\n\nYou know, we had the same life.\n\nYou know, not only just wives, show business wives,\n\nwe were wives of comedians.\n\nAnd one of the reasons he married Barbara was\n\nbecause she never laughed at his jokes.\n\n[both chuckle]\n\nIt was, you know. Hmm. Oh that's nice.\n\nThat's, that's, oh, that's funny.\n\n[guys laugh]\n\nWell this is when we were in Israel,\n\nhe would keep making statements,\n\nand that's why it drove Barbara nuts,\n\n'cause- Right.\n\nHe was always wrong.\n\nOh, I'm sure. Uh-ha.\n\nAnd [chuckling] he said, Oh, there, that building.\n\nHe said, I know that's\n\nthe Israeli jail\n\nfor the Palestinians.\n\nAnd then the driver, David, would say, No,\n\nthat's the National Jewish Library.\n\nSo now we get, now he's asked a couple\n\nof the dumb questions. Right.\n\nAnd Don said, I know I'm right about this.\n\nYou say I keep asking dumb questions.\n\nThose poles were put up by the Israeli defense forces\n\nto prevent the, the tanks from Syria advancing any further.\n\nAnd the driver said, No, those poles were put up\n\nby the Israeli telephone company.\n\n[both chuckle]\n\n[Interviewer] And so you moved here. Don was here already.\n\nYeah, Don and Barbara. They have, they have\n\na house, not quite as big as this\n\n[all chuckle]\n\nabout a block and a half away.\n\n[Narrator] Yeah. - That's a commitment.\n\nAfter many years you decided you could handle that.\n\nKnowing him as I do,\n\n[both chuckle]\n\nI mean to wake up at eight o'clock in the morning\n\nand start the day off with being insulted,\n\nif that's your idea of a great time.\n\nBarbara's gone a year, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd Don's gone three years.\n\nDon is three years. Yeah.\n\n[melancholy piano music plays]\n\nWell, you know, he got sick almost immediately.\n\nWe moved here- Yeah.\n\nThat's what I remembered.\n\nWe moved here in 2016,\n\nand he died the year later.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nSo, I mean, he was so excited, and\n\nNow I can walk down to your house.\n\nAnd he was like a kid when we, you know,\n\nsaid we're gonna move here,\n\nand he got sick.\n\nDon had the same condition I wound up with,\n\nwhich was a spinal stenosis,\n\nand he couldn't do you know what he used to do,\n\nrunning across the stage, running back and forth.\n\nI think that hurt a little bit,\n\nbecause it took a lot of the energy.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\n[dramatic orchestra music plays]\n\nHe was pretty much doing it right up until the end,\n\nexcept he wasn't standing up.\n\n[Interviewer] He was in... Yeah.\n\nAnd,\n\n[Interviewer] you, you missed that, Yeah.\n\nthat energy,\n\nthat\n\nwas gone.\n\nYou know, at first it's always a shock.\n\nAnd now I think of something\n\nand I, oh, I have to call Barbara\n\nbecause we talk for 60 years almost, ya know?\n\nThat's a long time. I miss her.\n\nI miss her.\n\nI miss him.
