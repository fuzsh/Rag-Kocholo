        "text": "Hola, people! I am Carlos Cordero, New Choral Music Advocate, and Choral Composer. If you are looking for my bio, you are in the right place! Why did I write so many bios? Because so many organizations ask me for a different one, so I wanted all options on the table.\n\nIf you wonder, my favorite is the first one. If you are looking for third-person bios, they are at the end!\n\nOne Line Artist Bio (200 characters)\n\nCarlos Cordero (b. 1992) is a gay Latinx immigrant artist who promotes change that supports the LGBTQ+ and immigrant community as a new choral music advocate, composer, conductor, and singer.\n\nArtist Biography (200 words)\n\nCarlos Cordero (b. 1992) promotes change as a new choral music advocate, composer, singer, and hug-giver. As a gay Latinx immigrant artist, Carlos advocates for the LGBTQ+ and immigrant community through his brand, The Happy Choir, and his professional Tenor-Bass choir, Un/heard. His mission is to create moments where people discuss how to be kinder with each other and themselves. Selected commissions include EXIGENCE, Conspirare, Chorus Austin, and other organizations recognized for their social advocacy. Carlos is the Music Director at Austin‚Äôs Central Presbyterian Church and founder of the New Choral Music Society, a non-profit advocating for opportunities for new choral music composers and poets. Despite his family‚Äôs lack of support in pursuing a music career, Carlos completed composition and performance studies, holding an M.M. in Composition from the University of Houston, where he met his choral luminaries, Dr. Betsy Cook Weber and Dr. David Ashley White. Carlos is Chorus America‚Äôs Alice Parker Fund Award 2024 recipient, recognizing the exemplary work of a Black or Latinx composer who respectfully and authentically presents works incorporating these traditions and experiences. Carlos is originally from Venezuela, where he was a choral conductor and music educator at El Sistema; he currently resides in Austin, Texas, with his two Chiweenies, Sweet Pea and Olive. People visiting Austin should reach out to him to have some Venezuelan food!\n\n3 sentences bio and Artist Statement\n\nI give (great) hugs : )\n\nI write choral music and words : ))\n\nI advocate for new choral music : ))\n\nPersonal Bio\n\nHola, People! My name is Carlos (Cordero). I give [great] hugs, write choral music and words, and advocate for new choral music üôÇ Yes, I have won awards, yet, that is secondary to the meaningful connections I continue to make in the choral hive. I called my brand ‚ÄúThe Happy Choir,‚Äù where I share my music, texts, and stories. I am the founder of the New Choral Music Society, a non-profit that advocates for opportunities for new choral music composers, and artistic director of Un/Heard, a TTBB choir that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights through choral music. That‚Äôs cool!\n\nDespite my family‚Äôs lack of support when I left med school for music, I‚Äôve had the honor to work with wonderful organizations such as Chorus Austin, Salt Lake Vocal Artists, Conspirare, Ensemble Companio, ACDA, and many more! It‚Äôs ok! My family came on board with me being a musician‚Äî and gay üòâ I just happen to help people in many more ways now.\n\nI am an early bird thanks to my two Chiweenies, Sweet Pea and Olive. I take the morning to take care of myself, whether that‚Äôs exercising, working, writing, singing, crocheting, or coding. I am also the Music Director at Central Presbyterian Church where I get to create meaningful moments with awesome people for our congregation in Austin, TX. Now unto food!\n\nI was born in 1992 in Maracaibo, Venezuela. Sounds sexy? It is, especially its food. However, you might have heard there is a terrible humanitarian crisis in my country. Besides eating, I worked at El Sistema as a choral conductor and music educator while getting a BM and MM. Then I moved to Houston to get an MM in Music Composition at the University of Houston where I studied with Dr. David Ashley White and sang under the direction of Dr. Betsy Cook Weber‚Ä¶ Choral heaven. If you are in Austin, let‚Äôs have some arepas üôÇ"
