        "text": "Hola, People! My name is Carlos Cordero! I am a full-time composer, hug-giver, and singer with a crazy mind. My passion for choral music and connecting with others has led me to create meaningful experiences and relationships around the world, including winning several composition competitions. Back in 2018 I was selected as University of Houston’s Affiliated Fellow at the American Academy of Rome, spending two months in Rome writing music and poems, eating delicious food, and meeting fascinating people. I love writing music for singers, including an operetta called Un Cuento de Luces y Sombras. I also write for instruments, just less often! My pieces have traveled around the world, including America, Europe, and Asia!\n\nI am originally from Venezuela, a beautiful country with delicious food! I am living in Austin, Texas with my husband, Ryan Heller after finishing my Master of Music in Composition at University of Houston, where I studied with Dr. David Ashley White. I can’t believe I had the chance to sing with UH’s Concert Chorale under the direction of Dr. Betsy Cook Weber, winning the 28th Béla Bartók International Choral Competition Grand Prix. Most of my scores are self-published in my website, The Happy Choir. Panamusica, E.C. Schirmer, and Selah Publishing publish some of my scores too. I am currently working on The Happy Choir while working as composer-in-residence in Chorus Austin. I am a former Choral Conductor and Music Educator at El Sistema, with a B.M. and a Specialization in Composition from Universidad Católica Cecilio Acosta."
