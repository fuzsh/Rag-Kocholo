        "text": "When Betsy Cook started her clothing business National Picnic five years ago, she wanted to work from home to be around for her young daughters.\n\nEven though Josie and Suzy are now teenagers and National Picnic has expanded to a Philadelphia storefront, Cook still likes to work out of her Collingswood house. Two rooms are dedicated to her garments, patterns and sewing supplies.\n\nAT HOME WITH ... Wagon Wheel Winery owner\n\nIt was there she named the clothing line, with help from her sister, singer-songwriter Birdie Busch. They were inspired by National Picnic Month – July, by the way – and the way people would dress to go on a picnic.\n\nWith her laptop, Cook often takes her work from her office into the kitchen, or out onto the wide porch spanning the front of the 1920s bungalow. There she can sit on the roomy glider, a gift from her neighbor, with her dog Yukie curled up at her feet.\n\n“It’s the hangout area,” she said. A Skee-Ball game dominates half the space; Cook bought it from an old arcade and transported and hid it with help from her husband Josh’s friends.\n\n“It’s probably the most surprising gift I’ve ever given him,” she said.\n\nIt does make the porch a prime space for entertaining. There are also plenty of chairs to seat guests.\n\n“I’m addicted to chairs,” Cook said. “There’s always one too many chairs in the room.”\n\nSeamed leather chairs in the Cooks’ living room were rescued from Josh’s office after they were deemed ruined. Cook doesn’t know what caused the spots on the leather seats, maybe cleaning products, but to her, the spots add character.\n\nArt is a centerpiece of the Cook home. They often rotate paintings on the walls, changing things up without spending a dime.\n\nThere are 1920s fashion illustrations done by her husband’s relative who went to fashion school in New York in the ‘20s. There are paintings by local artists and ones bought as souvenirs, like the New Orleans street scene bought on a New Orleans corner. Some paintings were done by Cook.\n\n“I paint on vacations because I don’t have time to paint for pleasure any other time,” she said. Many are small and pinned to the wall, like hand-made postcards of the beaches and mountains the family has visited.\n\nStained glass made by Cook hangs in the windows and is installed in the doors to her office. She always liked making things that were tangible, she said, even when she was working in graphic design.\n\nAside from the art, “We’ve been lucky that we have a lot of relatives that haven’t thrown things out,” Cook said.\n\nBetween treasures the Cooks trash-picked or family heirlooms passed down through generations, most of the items in the house have a backstory.\n\nThe living room coffee table was crafted from a giant, industrial bellows decades ago; an antique stuffed elephant – affectionately named “Steiffy” because it is by German toymaker Steiff – has been delighting Cook kids for decades; the dining room set belonged to Cook’s grandparents.\n\nThe dining table doubles as a cutting table for Cook when she is working with patterns. She has a cutting table in the basement, but finds the dining room to be much nicer and brighter.\n\nAnd, more importantly, close to the rest of the family.\n\nCook does a lot of sewing in her store in Old City where she can interact with customers. She moved into the storefront at the beginning of the year to grow her business.\n\n“I can sell to people from all over the country and sometimes the world because they walk down my street,” Cook said. But she still enjoys working from home when she can.\n\n“This house has been perfect for letting me perform the different functions of designing a clothing line,” Cook said. “And my kids can be in the other room doing their homework.”\n\nIn her office there is a framed New York Times Magazine she rescued from being cut up in a college art class. On a shelf above her desk (trash-picked, 1950s, re-done Formica), the historic cover features George Foreman and Muhammad Ali and reminds Cook of the quote from “Rocky,” about how he doesn’t know it’s a show, he thinks it’s a fight.\n\n“Fashion, it’s not a show,” Cook said. “I’m fighting to stay in business.”\n\nThe magazine cover isn’t the only interesting artifact in the house. An antique map cabinet came from the schooner Vema, which collected ocean sediment cores for Columbia University. There is an old Crescent Bottling Company sign and bottles from the defunct Camden factory. Old metal irons, Portuguese blankets – they even converted an old filing cabinet into a handy charging station.\n\nIn the end, the primary objective is livability.\n\n“It’s not a museum,” Cook said. “We use every corner of the house.”\n\nShannon Eblen: (856) 486-2475; SEblen@gannettnj.com"
