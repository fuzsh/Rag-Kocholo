        "text": "Kent Robbins was a Mayfield-born songwriter (1947-97) and Vanderbilt graduate who signed with Charley Pride’s Pi-Gem Music in 1974. Robbins' first number-one was Ronnie Milsap's 1976, Grammy-nominated, (I'm a) Stand By My Woman Man. Robbins penned three of Charley Pride's best-known hits, When I Stop Leavin' (I'll Be Gone), You're My Jamaica\", and I Don't Think She's in Love Anymore. After some time in the industry, Robbins formed his own publishing company with Buzz Cason in the 1980s and wrote Love Is Alive and Young Love (Strong Love), chart-toppers for The Judds.\n\nRobbins also wrote the 1990s top 10 hits Wanna Go Too Far and Every Light in the House for Trisha Yearwood and Trace Adkins respectively. Kent Robbins was posthumously inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame after his tragic death in a holiday season car crash in 1997. His last number-one hit, George Strait's Write This Down, was the second-most played country song of 1999."
