        "text": "July 11, 2014\n\nToday’s song is Give Me A Sad Song by Linda Thompson. She wrote it with longtime friend and collaborator Betsy Cook, intending to include it on her second solo album. Unfortunately, vocal problems put off that project for years. A lovely demo version became the title track of a rarities compilation that she released during her extended hiatus from recording. After more than 20 years, she dusted off the song for inclusion on her third album, 2007’s sublime Versatile Heart. With capable assistance from son Teddy Thompson, she crafted a version even more compelling that the tantalizing demo. A bittersweet song of nostalgia and yearning, it’s a perfect fit for her outstanding songbook."
