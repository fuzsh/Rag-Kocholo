        "text": "Honest Accomplice Theatre tells stories that are rarely brought to light: those that are silenced, pushed aside, or deemed too “fringe” for mainstream theater. Working with an ensemble of artists, the company works to bring these topics into the light; to create dialogue about the things we don’t see onstage when it comes to the lives of female-identified and trans people.\n\nReconFIGUREd, the company’s latest piece, is a heart-warming devised work about the experience of living in our bodies, and how it feels to inhabit the female and trans identity. We spoke with members of the cast about their process, their characters, and why theater matters.\n\nHelen Schultz: How did you get involved with HAT/ReconFIGUREd?\n\nSeth Day (He/Him/His): It’s actually a funny story! Although I had some theater experience growing up, I’m not an actor by trade. I wasn’t actively searching for acting gigs, but I’m a member of this Facebook group that is a forum to share queer-friendly employment opportunities, and I saw the casting call for ReconFIGUREd and thought, “Why not!?” To be honest, I almost chickened out of the audition, but the project seemed so important to me. The subject matter of the show is what really piqued my interest. It was the first time I had seen a casting call that was genuinely interested in the trans experience.\n\nHS: Tell me about your character and creative/design role.\n\nSD: I’m one of the two actors playing Luke, a trans guy in the first year of his transition, who struggles with feeling the need to perform toxic masculinity in order to be seen as male. He also has some family drama going on and has to balance that with dealing with his masculinity issues. It’s very exciting for me as a transperson to get to play a trans character, and to put a story on stage that feels more authentic than other trans representations in the media.\n\nI’m also the prop designer, which was a first for me and a fun challenge! I really tried to give attention to detail to each and every prop in a way that each prop adds something to the story.\n\nHS: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with current identity/body politics?\n\nSD: Generally when people see theater it’s for enjoyment, so I think when we go see a show, we let our guard down. If I were to walk up to someone and try to engage in a conversation about the body or gender or any sensitive topic, I think they’d probably be a little guarded. But when we let our guard down and are open, theater can really change us.\n\nHS: Tell me about one of the scenes in the play.\n\nSD: There is a power ballad sung from the last remaining estrogen in a menopausal body. What more do you need?\n\nHS: Tell me about a moment in the development process that surprised or stuck out to you.\n\nSD: At the beginning of each devising session, we would go around and introduce our name and pronouns (as these are things that can change!). And one session, one of the ensemble members asked us to use a pronoun I had never even heard of before, which was a really humbling moment for me. Sometimes I think just because I’m trans, I know all there is to know about gender, but that was a great reminder that we all have room to grow and learn!\n\nHS: What is one thing you hope people take away from this piece?\n\nSD: I suppose I don’t really care what people take away from the show as long as they’re still thinking after it’s over. My hope is that the show starts a conversation!\n\nHS: What makes this show unique?\n\nSD: I think one of the most unique aspects of this show is its honesty. That and the fact that about a third of the cast is trans! Which is just amazing.\n\nHelen Schultz: How did you get involved with ReconFIGUREd?\n\nJo’Lisa Jones (She/Her/Hers): I saw a posting to audition for the devising portion, not realizing that a friend of mine had actually worked for HAT previously and gave them glowing reviews, so I knew I should go for it! The reason I first wanted to get involved was because I feel like seldom do women and trans folk have an opportunity to truly discuss and express what our bodies go through. I also wanted to share and relate my experiences with other people so that others feel comfortable to speak up and so that I could find some camaraderie.\n\nHS: Tell me about your character.\n\nJJ: My character’s name is Fiona, and she works in a women’s health clinic that also performs abortions. Despite having fertility issues, she gets pregnant, only to suffer a miscarriage. This character is loosely related to a short movement piece that I created about having an invisible illness, as I have PCOS [Polycystic Ovary Syndrome] and can potentially have fertility issues, so this character is very near and dear to my heart.\n\nHS: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story? How does it help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with current identity/body politics?\n\nJJ: I think it’s a fun way to be educated. You are moved by the characters and gain new perspectives on what others may be going through. People want to have fun, and I think ReconFIGUREd is a really fun show that has a beautifully crafted undercurrent of truth telling and insight – and other times we just let it all hang out because that’s appropriate too!\n\nHS: Tell me about a moment in the development process that surprised or stuck out to you.\n\nJJ: I think the strongest moment in the development process that stuck out was the day we were embodying mental illness and addictions. It was truly enlightening to me. I have been very fortunate to not suffer from either and, although I may logically understand both, I don’t always physically or emotionally understand what’s happening. It finally clicked that day because, rather than having a verbal scene, I got to see how it wears on the body, and that really struck a cord with me.\n\nHelen Schultz: How did you get involved with HAT/ReconFIGUREd?\n\nJordan Ho (Xe/Xem/Xyr or She/Her/Hers): I started working with HAT in 2015 for the Tank run of The Birds and the Bees: Unabridged and I have been with them ever since. I stayed because this company is like home to me.\n\nHS: Tell me about your character.\n\nJH: I devised the role of Melanie in the show with castmate Holly Samson. There are many facets to Melanie: having a trans brother and a mother who works in an abortion clinic, on top of figuring out her race, ethnic identity, and coping with mental illness. It’s been a joy getting to create Melanie, and I hope anyone else who is suffering can find comfort in her arc.\n\nHS: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story? How does it help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with current identity/body politics?\n\nJH: When talking about the body academically, it’s easy to desensitize ourselves from actually addressing the issues. Not to say that literature and news articles are telling lies, but written word automatically makes these concepts abstract and not attached to our physical forms. And even if these concepts do manifest inside our bones, the natural next step is to act, which is why we do theater. I think there will be something powerful about seeing actual bodies tell the stories about how we carry and take care of our vessels.\n\nHS: Tell me about one of the scenes in the play.\n\nJH: There happens to be a musical number called “Gemme Femmes” that is horrifyingly entertaining. I grew up watching shows like Sailor Moon, The Winx Club, and Mew Mew Power, so I have a strong affinity to girl-power television. That being said, it is so, so interesting looking back and seeing just the opening intros and seeing these shallow molds of femininity veiled under the guise of being a cute television show for kids.\n\nHS: Tell me about a moment in the development process that surprised or stuck out to you.\n\nJH: Honestly, I was most surprised when we learned our character tracks and who was paired with whom. I’m a trans gender fluid actrex, so I just assumed that I would be assigned a trans character. But when I heard that I would be working with Holly to devise the role of a cisgender woman, I was really struck for a moment. And then I had a creative epiphany: because if Hollywood is so dead set on allowing cis people to play trans characters, then why can’t a trans person play a cis character? I will never forget this moment because it gave me such clarity that trans artists are capable of anything. Creating this role has helped me reclaim my femininity, and I’m so glad that Maggie, Rachel, and Holly have trusted me in this creation process.\n\nHelen Schultz: How did you get involved with HAT/ReconFIGUREd?\n\nSimona Berman (She/Her/Hers): I came on board this year for ReconFIGUREd and am outrageously happy to now be in the company.\n\nHS: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story? How does it help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with current identity/body politics?\n\n​”​And i said to my body. softly. ‘I want to be your friend.’ it took a long breath. and replied ‘i have been waiting my whole life for this.'”​\n\nWhen I first read this quote by Nayyirah Waheed, I literally took a deep breath as I was reading, unconsciously wrapped my arms around my body, and started to cry. Or at least dry heave a bit, because I stopped myself from crying long ago when I was bullied growing up and didn’t want to give the bullies anymore fodder for their fire. Much of that bullying was a catalyst in my long continuous battle with my body. Along with a few eating disorders, I also struggle with body dysmorphia: where I look in the mirror and see my arm and where the large muscle from doing gymnastics meets my large breast it triggers my brain to see my body as one big armbreast – much bigger than it actually is.\n\nThat quote by Nayyirah took me out of my head and separated me from my body and gave my body its own persona, arousing empathy in me for my body. As a self-hating Empath, it is easier for me to be moved to action by others, not so much for myself. I suddenly saw my body as a scared little girl, who opened her arms wide and said, “Please love me, I beg of you!” The quote made me want to take care of that little girl that is my body. This was easier for me to process as opposed to trying to just love me for me.\n\nThat’s what theater does for certain issues, such as the ones we tackle in ReconFIGUREd. Theater takes an issue and initiates awareness for someone to be able to see outside of themselves. For an audience, if they connect deeply to the story as if it was theirs personally, theater allows for aesthetic distance where the story becomes a safe friend that might help someone feel less alone or less awkward. It also opens up whole new worlds for people who can’t relate at all to the story personally, but being able to see, hear, feel the story played out can now evoke empathy for the characters. Or at least a better understanding, as opposed to just hearing about it or reading about it in a random story.\n\nHelen Schultz: How did you get involved with HAT/ReconFIGUREd?\n\nHolly Sansom (She/Her/Hers): I started working with Maggie and Rachel before the Honest Accomplice Theatre company was created, back in 2012. I was an original ensemble member and deviser for the show The Birds and the Bees: Unabridged. When HAT was formed in 2014, I came on as the General Manager as well.\n\nHS: Tell me about your character.\n\nHolly: I share the role of Melanie with Mx. Jordan Ho. Melanie is a cis woman thinking about her identity as a biracial person in America. She is also dealing with mental illness and how these aspects of her body affect her relationship with the world and the people in her life.\n\nHelen Schultz: How and when did you get involved with HAT/ReconFIGUREd?\n\nJesse Geguzis (Squee/Squer/Squem): I had auditioned for the previous project and then I was asked to be a part of this project about a year ago.\n\nHS: Tell me about your character.\n\nJG: Luke is a young trans guy in college and struggling to be comfortable in his new body with old friends and family of origin.\n\nHS: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story? How does it help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with current identity/body politics?\n\nJG: I think theater can change the world. Everyone involved in this project is throwing their energy at creating change. I think visual mediums are the strongest vehicle to get into folks’ heads and leave them starting to change their thinking. It plants a seed. This company is gardening a new world by telling new non-heteronormative narratives.\n\nHS: Tell me about one of the scenes in the play.\n\nJG: My favorite scene is with my character, Luke, and his sister Melanie, fighting and trying to find common ground around identity struggles. The whole scene takes place with both characters wearing the same giant shirt, as a punishment for fighting by their mother.\n\nHS: What is one thing you hope people take away from this piece?\n\nJG: I hope people leave thinking about how to open up their minds more and more every day.\n\nHS: What makes this show unique?\n\nJG: It’s a company of only female and trans-identified folks.\n\nHelen Schultz: How and when did you get involved with HAT/ ReconFIGUREd?\n\nKat Swanson (She/Her/Hers): I was lucky enough to be involved with HAT early through some of the first Birds and the Bees workshops, which I heard about through Rachel while working with her on another project. I remember being so struck by the questions being asked and by the process. I tried to be involved in whatever way I could from there. I helped out a bit with general support on one of the Birds and the Bees productions, and finally had the chance to be involved from the beginning of this project.\n\nHS: Tell me about your character.\n\nKS: My character is a struggling single mother named Donna. She has an eight-year-old daughter named Ari – short for Ariel – who she’s supporting on her own (the father has been out of the picture for some time now), which creates a lot of financial hardships. She also grapples with lack of self-love, binge eating disorder (BED), and back pain, partially caused by having larger breasts. Donna suffers from the classic single-parent time versus money dilemma: how can she be a good mother to Ari when all she has time to focus on is the next step, the next place to be, the next bill to pay? She’s in survival mode and is realizing the negative impact on her growing daughter.\n\nHS: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with current identity/body politics?\n\nKS: I really think that seeing is believing and feeling is understanding. People who aren’t trans or women or disabled and so on don’t really know what gaps exist in their understanding. When you don’t live it, you just don’t know. You can read an article or catch on to all the political and social media buzzwords and think you know something, but you just don’t. People are often afraid to admit, even to themselves, that they don’t understand.\n\nTheater is such a unique art form in how it is able to combine all the other art forms to create a true, visceral experience. It is able to make the audience see and feel and have at least the opportunity to start to know. By attending and really opening yourself up to a play that portrays an experience that is not your own, you get a chance to empathize with other people. That empathy, especially when it occurs on a large scale, is – I think – what really has the power to make a difference in people and society as a whole.\n\nHS: Tell me about one of the scenes in the play.\n\nKS: Ooph – tough question! There are so many excellent ones. My favorite scene is one that portrays caretaking for a character whose mobility has been severely impacted by her battle with cancer. It’s really loaded – the daughter is getting ready herself and is helping her mother get ready for the day at the same time. The scene is great because the dialogue is very normal but also tells so much in so little. I think it’s something a lot of families can relate to, [regardless of the] situation they’re in. It hit a chord with me because my mom has been wheelchair-bound her entire life, but growing up, I realized that no one really understood what that meant for her day-to-day life. They had this general, blind pity and were usually kind – all good things – but they had no idea what it took for her just to get out of bed, to use the bathroom, things that able-bodied folk, myself included, often take for granted. I cried when I saw it because it just hit home so hard. I hope it makes able-bodied folks happy to be in their bodies to some degree, and also helps people who are in a similar position as this character for whatever reason feel more understood and represented onstage.\n\nHS: Tell me about a moment in the development process that surprised you or stuck out to you.\n\nKS: I didn’t realize how tough the development process could be. For a while, I thought I was the only one who was in rehearsal feeling as though I didn’t belong there, like I didn’t have anything to contribute. To Maggie and Rachel’s credit, things kept moving forward because they heard these concerns from several folks in the room and implemented things like a “question box”. [The idea of the box is] to try and help the cast understand each other better, and also understand what they each brought to the room – all while taking the “educator” responsibility on themselves. [Because of that], folks who are often put into that position involuntarily in their day-to-day lives didn’t have to take that role on here. It became such a safe space to discuss really challenging issues with lots of differing viewpoints. While it was tough, the end result and the value of realizing that kind of space is possible was immeasurable to me.\n\nAs for a specific moment… picking one, I guess I was really surprised to realize that a lot of people don’t view their periods as a negative thing. For some it’s culturally celebrated, for others it’s empowering and magical – it opened my mind because for me, my period had just always been a monthly “Congrats, you’re not pregnant!” notification and a frustrating, painful, messy pain-in-the-ass. It’s hard to explain, but it was a really memorable rehearsal.\n\nHS: What is one thing you hope people take away from this piece?\n\nKS: I hope people take away a new appreciation for the complexity of a person’s agency over their body, as well as the wide variety of experiences that are different from their own. I hope they see and appreciate something new, and I hope they ask questions and start talking about things they’ve been silent about before.\n\nHS: What makes this show unique?\n\nKS: It’s people and it’s honesty.\n\n***\n\nReconFIGUREd is playing at The Tank on January 6 to January 15, 2017. Tickets can be purchased at http://thetanknyc.org. For $10 tickets, use code HATBODY.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how we are starting to look at the world as “pre 11/9” and “post 11/9.” That’s not a typo, and is in no way meant to disrespect references to the devastating tragedies that happened in America on September 11, 2001. But I do believe that November 9, 2016 is a date on which many Americans – no matter how they voted in the presidential election the day before – saw a seismic shift in the way certain citizens found permission to express themselves. This, in turn, has created a seismic shift in our understanding of the world in which we have always lived, but are perhaps seeing through a pair of newly shattered glasses.\n\nIt seems that for some people who have been harboring years, decades, and perhaps generations of hatred and fear towards those who do not look like them or worship like them or speak like them (just to begin), the election has sanctioned expressing their preferred worldview in new and bold ways. Words and actions indicate that some now feel profoundly entitled to demonize (with a certain kind of giddiness) entire populations of other human beings who have been living, working, voting, and paying taxes amongst them. Turning their backs on the principles with which this country was founded, they seem to be intent on rewriting the narrative to say: “Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free – but not you, you, and certainly not you.”\n\nCan the arts influence a wider worldview? The tip of the iceberg of this debate is reflected in the response to the whole Hamilton/Mike Pence situation (if you were hiding under your covers that weekend, here is a link to the New York Times article about it). The incident spurred comments suggesting (among other things) that the show, which casts our founding fathers with people of color to make a statement on the role immigrants had in the forming of the U.S.A, “erases white culture,” but that’s a whole other discussion.\n\nWhat I’d like to talk about here might seem like a simplistic assessment of some of the ways I think the arts can influence a worldview that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive. But it seems to me that the spate of hate crimes that have been occurring post 11/9 are as huge a flashing sign as any that we need to do better in how we reflect the world and our individual diversity on our stages and screens, in the media and in popular culture.\n\nNow to be crystal clear: I am not equating in any way, shape or form the arts and media’s portrayal of our gorgeous tapestry to the kind of prejudice we’re seeing across the country right now. And I’m not naïve enough to think that expanding this portrayal could heal the giant schism that is at the heart of our national divide all by itself. But I think it can absolutely play a part. And we need to do better.\n\nWhen journalist Roland Martin recently interviewed Richard Spencer (president of an “alt-right” organization with the seemingly innocuous name of “The National Policy Institute”) about his view of post 11/9 America, Mr. Spencer claimed supremacy founded on an assertion that Europeans invented everything in civilization (no, really, he said this – watch this lengthy but illuminating interview). This, he believes, is why white people deserve to be compensated with all of the opportunities that America has to offer. When Mr. Martin asked if he had ever heard about the pyramids built by the Egyptians, for example (never mind gunpowder, paper, the compass, and printing – all contributed by the Chinese – and other life altering inventions by other cultures), Mr. Spencer countered that “Egyptians are white.” Now, clearly he needs a history lesson. But it could also be argued that the plethora of media images on stage and screen (see “Aida,” “Cleopatra,” “Exodus,” “The Ten Commandments,” etc.) help to tell him that this is so. In addition, the more we (women, Muslims, Asian Americans, African Americans, LGBTQ Americans, people with disabilities, Latino/a, etc.) are viewed as “other” in the media and not portrayed with authenticity or accuracy or sheer inclusion of our stories, the more people who have this kind of skewed view of the world and/or have no contact with actual living humans who are women, Muslim, Asian American, African American, LGBTQ, Latino/a and/or have a disability etc can choose to believe that these images and portrayals reflect the truth of our American landscape. The more we are seen as “other” in the media and the American theater, the more we are seen as “other” in the theater of American culture.\n\nIn June of 2015, I had the privilege of addressing members of FIA (The International Federation of Actors) about the global impact of diversity on our stages. FIA is made up of performers’ trade unions, guilds and professional associations from more than 60 countries around the world – and as national chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Committee at Actors’ Equity Association, I had been invited to participate in the conference along with other elected leaders of the union and executive staff. What moved me most, without a doubt, was to see the shared passions that we had for making theater, and the ways in which our commonalities were made more textured and beautifully complex by our differences.\n\nWhen I addressed the delegates, I pointed out that the bridges we were building there and the ways our global perspective had expanded by getting to know each other just over a few short days were prime examples of why inclusion is vital. Without it, you would miss out on a whole lot. I noted how we began introductions to each other by asking what country we were from and whom we represented – but after that, all that mattered was how we connected on a human level: what we cared about, what we were fighting for, and how we were effecting change. And that phenomenon – connecting on a human level once you get a glimpse into someone’s life; someone who might literally live around the world from you, or not even speak the same language as you, or look anything like you — that phenomenon of connecting on a human level is at the heart of how I believe the theater can unite us. It’s a spectacular and singular opportunity. And one that can never be underestimated.\n\nI asked them to imagine if the conference delegates had been chosen based solely on the color of our eyes – nothing to do with individual qualities, skills, contributions, or achievements – but only on the color of our eyes. That would be ridiculous. But that’s how many of us feel when we are evaluated or excluded from even having the chance to audition for a role whose cultural specificity is not germane to the story. That’s how we feel when we are excluded based solely on the color of our skin or the shape of our eyes. That’s how we feel when we are told to “go back to where you came from,” based not on actual knowledge of who we are and where we actually did come from, but based on an assumption that our “otherness” makes us “less than” and therefore unworthy to be considered “American.”\n\nIt seems that this is what is at the core of today’s fractured discourse: the unwillingness to connect on a human level, but rather responding to fear and perceived threats to the status quo. The outright dismissal of individualism, the blanket assumptions attached to race, gender, religious beliefs, presence or absence of a disability, sexual preference, gender identity, and so on, and the belief that the mere existence of entire populations of people can only lead to lack – all add up to form a vicious circle of fear and hate, hate and fear.\n\nI acknowledge that this assessment requires me to try to connect on a human level with those who threaten Muslim citizens living in their neighborhoods, those who vandalize synagogues with swastikas, those who beat up LGBTQ Americans for being LGBT or Q, those who tell children they’ll be deported, those who would have me banished from the only country I’ve ever called home, etc. I’m still working on wrapping my head around that one. To follow this line of thinking, I cannot in good faith condemn these people without getting to know them either. But as we disagree, fundamentally, on how to treat one another, I admit that this is a more difficult task than I can currently handle.\n\nStill, I contend that now more than ever, we need to find ways to go further in expanding perceptions of who we are and what we can do. At my core, I’ve always firmly believed that the media and media images can help do this. When we find more substantive ways to stop defining our storytellers only by the color of their skin, their presence of a disability, gender, age, creed, sexual identity, etc. and look more at our individual qualities and skills, perhaps we can help to penetrate the national psyche with our individual and then collective humanity, as expressed through our art. Can this really make a dent in the National Hate? Honestly, I don’t know anymore. But I think we have to try. And try harder.\n\nThe gross display of man’s inhumanity to man over the past few weeks has made me go through the seven stages of grief for my advocacy work – yet I have also been buoyed and inspired by the compassion and empathy of artists. We cannot capitulate and make hate the new normal. We cannot. This is not a statement in favor of “political correctness.” This is a statement in favor of civility and kindness, an appeal to uplift our better angels with the help of the images and stories we share in the arts and media.\n\nWe must be even louder than those who scream at us to “go back to where we came from.” Because where I really want to go is a place where our open, creative hearts can beat freely and express the many layers of our diverse humanity – with an expectation of celebration, not annihilation. A place where we can help keep the world we want to live in from being bullied to death. I hope we can.\n\nCHRISTINE TOY JOHNSON is an award-winning writer, actor, filmmaker, director and advocate for inclusion.

The discussion covered a gamut, from the evolution of trans characters, the growing visibility of trans performers as well as writers, designers and so on. As the night went on and I listened to other stories that were being told by my trans siblings, I realized that as different as we are, we had one thing in common: the feeling of awkwardness around cisgender (non-trans) people who think they understand our journey and want to retell our stories – and then fail miserably. Don’t get me wrong, I love the idea of people being interested in telling stories about my community. But, for the same reason I don’t write about slavery, the Holocaust, or uterine cancer without conducting proper research/interviewing people who have first hand experience of these topics, I feel offended when someone else tries to tell me what my experience as a transgender woman must have been like. They expect me to swallow their falsehood – whether it’s a blog, a movie, or political rhetoric – and be grateful that they even acknowledge my existence. I cannot and will not stand for it. I, and many like me, have put up with this for a long time, but no more!\n\nThen I thought maybe we, the trans community, should tell our own stories. But who? Me?\n\nWho the fuck am I to write about this? Well, if not me, then who? I may not be the best choice, but I have seen eye opening things in my community and I need to tell the rest of the world what I’ve seen…\n\nThe stereotypical lying, tricking transgender – who is possibly a street hooker – does exist, as do all stereotypes, but is as true as almost all other generalizations; it does not acknowledge a whole community. As a trans woman, I admit that there is some truth to the fact that the trans community – especially the trans-feminine community – has higher numbers of sex workers per capita than their cisgender/non-trans counterparts and maybe even the gay community. But, do we ever wonder why?\n\nDo we ever wonder where the myth of the lying, cheating, manipulative Tranny prostitute who is out to trick the unsuspecting straight man comes from? Most of us don’t think about why there are so many trans women who turn tricks to make a living – why they would give unprotected blowjobs in back alleys and get propositioned in the least humane way by people who, on the surface, seem respectable and “normal,” but in secret, drool over the idea of being with a “chick with a dick.” We don’t ask why because we don’t really care enough to want to be bothered by the route of this issue. In the same vein, we blame rape on what the victim was wearing, or what she/he/they was drinking, or where they were walking. The perils of the trans community are looked at as our punishment for being freaks. We are disowned, thrown out, bullied, fired, refused proper healthcare, raped, assaulted and killed…because we asked for it!? I was born into an educated, reasonably progressive, middle class Iranian family. I had no confusion about my gender since as long as I can remember, nor do I think it was any real secret to my immediate family, even though they couldn’t come to terms with it until they had to. By the time I hit puberty and started having questions about love, attraction, and gender, I realized I had no place in the world around me. I would be safer if I didn’t speak. I would be left alone if I stayed in the dark. I would be better off if I were invisible.\n\nHave you ever felt invisible? Have you ever wanted to feel invisible? Did it feel good? Did you enjoy it? No. I would bet that the thing that made you want to disappear was a painful and traumatic experience, one that you probably would never want to repeat and would like to forget at some point. This is how most LGBT youth, especially the transgender population, feel most of their lives: at school, on the street, at home…\n\nWe wake up to fear most of our lives – fear being hurt physically, emotionally, economically, and spiritually. We are afraid of being beaten by our families, harassed by classmates or even killed by a total stranger, for no reason other than the fact that we are transgender. When we do decide to step up to our truth and be open with the world, we risk losing our homes, our families, our jobs, and our lives. We look for warmth and safety wherever we can find them. They say “beggars can’t be choosers,” so let me tell you a little story:\n\nWhen I was 16, my parents became familiar with the term “gender identity disorder” – now referred to as gender dysphoria – for the first time from a therapist that diagnosed my gender variance. I was depressed, couldn’t sleep, didn’t eat. I was bullied at school. Boys would offer me “protection” at school in return for “favors.” At home, I felt like an unwanted guest. My parents couldn’t look at me or speak to me, let alone ask me how I felt. Don’t get me wrong, I love my mom and my late dad, but the truth is they didn’t know what to do. Their culture had not prepared them to deal with a transgender child. To them, I was sick, and they looked high and low to find a cure; I was the guinea pig of this “conversion” therapy. It was mental and emotional torture, as anyone who has suffered such treatment would agree. I looked for affection anywhere I could find it, and I found it in the worst places. I got in cars with strangers. I went to parties. I got handed from person to person and I, at the age of 17, thought those people cared about me. Maybe some of them did, but the majority didn’t. I got offered money, which I had no use for at the time, so I refused, but it gave me a sense of power, control, and worth that I had no prior experience of. IT FELT GOOD! It felt great to be wanted.\n\nThat’s just a small part of my story, and I was one of the lucky ones. Even though my parents couldn’t talk to me, hug me, or tell me that it’s going to be okay, they didn’t throw me out and I didn’t have to run away from home. Many LGBT youth are not so lucky. In my 20-year journey of transitioning in New York City and seeing people’s attitudes change, I have seen many trans and queer youth who didn’t have a voice. These kids may not have had the education to verbalize their pain, but their pain was real and their pain would be unbearable for most heteronormative people to live through one day of their lives, let alone a lifetime. I saw kids who were thrown out of their front door with nothing more than the clothes on their back. I met queer youth of color who lived in group homes that were LGBTQ friendly and still suffered harassment. I encountered beautiful souls who engaged in unprotected sex with strangers in back alleys just to barely make ends meet or to buy their hormones illegally from some shady street dealer. I have known at least six or more trans women at different stages of transition who were escorts at some point in their lives, two of whom are now dead.\n\nPre-op transgender women are much more sought after by straight men than post-op Trans women. We are the golden idols of the human gender spectrum: worshiped in secret, vilified in the open.\n\nWhy are so many members of my community escorts and prostitutes? Plain and simple: we need it emotionally. We need to feel wanted and desired. We need to feel that we exist. We need to feel that somewhere in this world, someone wants us.\n\nWe need it financially. We were mostly let go of by our families and our communities. We have no ideas as to how we are suppose to prepare ourselves for the work force. We have no idea how we are suppose to pay for our meds, our therapy, or our gender-affirming surgeries, since until not too long ago, most transgender health needs were not covered by most insurances.\n\nWe DO NOT see ourselves represented. During my 19 years in New York City, I have only seen three individuals that I could discern were trans who were working behind a counter at a coffee shop, a bank, or any other store. I acknowledge that in stores which cater to the LGBT community, or areas that are more trans- and gay-friendly, the number of trans employees may be higher, but not enough to offer jobs to a greater portion of my disenfranchised community.\n\nTo add insult to injury, most of us in the LGBT community are never told, “You are worthy of love and respect.” We are told, “It is your choice,” “You are asking for it,” “God hates you,” and “You are sick.” We hear such hate so often that we begin to believe it. It becomes our inner punisher – so much so that even if no one else is around to harass us, we have our inner voice to beat us down. We carry shame because we have disappointed our loved ones: shame, guilt, doubt, and self-hate are very familiar feelings to us, not because we have done anything wrong, but only because we are different. We are openly and unapologetically ridiculed and vilified as pedophiles by the right, and shunned as frauds by radical feminists. Very few people, until recently, have stood up for our rights. In such a world where over 40% of trans youth have tried to commit suicide at some point, where transgender women showing up dead is rarely headline news, where a trans sex worker getting killed is just another “well, that was to be expected,” is it hard to imagine why the transgender community has such high percentage of sex workers? You may not like it. You may judge it. You may even condemn it. But it does not change the harsh truth my community lives through every day.\n\nSo, next time you want to judge my community for not being open enough, truthful enough, or worthy enough of your respect and compassion, ask yourself: what have you done to deserve that truth? Did you make us feel loved and safe, so we could tell you who we are? Did you help build our self-esteem so that we could also contribute to our society as others do? Did you at least give us the courtesy of respecting our gender and identity? If so, we are thankful for your humanity. If not, you deserve no respect or truth from anyone, because WE DON’T OWE ANYONE ANYTHING! We are part of the human race, just like anyone else. We exist, we love, we hurt and we learn. If you teach us love, we will love back. But if you teach us fear and hate, we will inevitably hide and lie. The choice is yours.\n\nWith much love, Pooya, your unicorn princess.\n\nI am an Iranian/American actress, born and raised in Tehran, Iran. I moved to New York in my teens, where I discovered my love of acting and story telling. I am a graduate from the esteemed Maggie Flanigan Studio. I continue building my resume of a variety of characters from weak to strong, while exploring their humanity and fragility.

I am also involved in writing and co-writing original LGBT stories to shed light on an otherwise under represented community.\n\nVery few writers’ retreats or artist residencies consider working mothers or single parents when it comes to programming. Enter Emily Simoness, co-founder and executive director of SPACE on Ryder Farm, who identified the issue and got to work. She created a first-of-its-kind family retreat, developed in conjunction with The Lilly Awards, aimed at supporting working parents and their children by providing a space for the artists to create, while also providing a creative and nature-focused program for the artists’ children.\n\nWe visited the farm during the week-long Family Residency program and sat down with Emily to learn about the development of the program. We also sat down with two of this year’s participating artists, Georgia Stitt and Deepa Purohit, to learn more about this unique and vital program.\n\nGina Rattan: How did the family residency come about?\n\nEmily Simoness: In 2014, there was a playwright and a designer who asked if they could bring their kids. Christine Jones, the designer, was curious if she could bring her two boys up with their sitter, and then Sarah Gancher was curious if her son could come up and we made allowances in both instances because it just felt like we should try to make that work.\n\nGR: How did the Lillys get involved?\n\nES: I somehow got wind that the Lillys were super interested in an initiative like this, so we connected and one of the great benefits of SPACE is that we’re still young and nimble. SPACE is not super bureaucratic or institutionalized. We’re able to pivot in a shorter time than an institution that plans two years in advance. As long as the insurance is good, and we are able to fund the program, we’re able to execute. So I said let’s do it this summer. That was last year, 2015, and we invited six women and their kids and it was good and productive. The kids had programming with Megan Cramer, who’s a really extraordinary educator and if it wasn’t for her I don’t think I would have felt comfortable doing this because I want to make sure the kids have great experiences. The kids had their special time and programming, the parents had time to work on their craft and we all came together for the three meals, and it was a total win. So we opened it up for applications this year.\n\nGR: So it was a test run last summer where you knew the people and could see how it went?\n\nES: Exactly. I was overwhelmed with the amount of applications, and the level of applications this year. It was articulated in a lot of these applications that I haven’t applied for an opportunity like this in a year or four years or seven years because I didn’t feel invited, or I didn’t feel like I could bring my kid, or I have to choose between my child and my work…all the different reasons that we make the choices that we make.\n\nGR: Were they mostly female applicants?\n\nES: 99% Female. I felt like I was reading these years of deferred applications, one after the other. It was really hard to pick. We’re contemplating next year doing two weeks just because the need is so strong. It’s also nice in that when there are kids in residence you get up earlier, you have dinner earlier, you go to bed earlier. Everything’s more civilized. It’s not debaucherous. We were leaving dinner yesterday and I was taking a couple of the staff to Trader Joe’s to get food or something and it’s still light outside. It’s nice. And it’s so clear that the demand is high, it’s so obvious that this should be a thing.\n\nGR: Is it more costly for you because you have to put together programming for the kids?\n\nES: Yeah.\n\nGR: So you have to hire more staff.\n\nES: There are more people here. Because typically we don’t double-up in rooms – there are double beds in rooms but we don’t double the occupancy in a lot of them, but with the kids we do. So it’s just a bigger number of people, the childcare is really significant.\n\nGR: So who comes to do that?\n\nES: The child care?\n\nGR: Yeah.\n\nES: Megan Cramer was at the 52nd Street Project forever. She now works at a school in Atlanta. She’s this amazing educator. Then there are individuals that work with her, Michael Calciano, who was a former SPACE intern, he’s an actor and he works a lot with kids, and then there’s Lindsay Torrey who’s been at the 52nd Street Project who also is an actor and works a lot with kids. They’re the same team that did it last year, so it’s been really nice to have them back.\n\nGR: So it’s an arts camp?\n\nES: Yeah. Art and farm camp. At 4pm, Alan Ryder, who is my cousin and has the eight sheep on the farm, is going to come and show the kids the sheep. Which is adorable.\n\nGR: They’re gonna love that. They were running after them earlier.\n\nMichelle Tse: You’re a board member of The Lilly Awards, where the idea for this program came about and was developed with Emily and SPACE. I know Julia Jordan was up here last year testing this out. Tell me more.\n\nGeorgia Stitt: Julia and Pia [Scala-Zankel] came up last year for the pilot program of this retreat. The idea for this whole thing was born at a Lilly board meeting. We were sitting around talking about the challenges of mid-career women writers and we all identified with the same problems. All of us in our 30s and 40s with kids confessed we had not applied to writers’ retreats for a decade. There comes a point where the thought of leaving your kids for a week or two or three to go work on your art feels, in a way, self-indulgent, and it’s more than your family can handle. So we all stopped applying because it didn’t seem practical to go.\n\nMT: Unless it somehow fits in perfectly with a school break.\n\nGS: Certainly during the school year it’s hard, and then during the summer – I mean, I’ve certainly done it before, where I leave my husband in charge of the kids, but we wind up paying so much in babysitters and hiring other people to fill the second parent role – it’s just this hardship that the whole family absorbs.\n\nMT: And perhaps dads don’t get as much flack for it.\n\nGS: Culturally, it’s less of an issue for dads. I’m not saying there aren’t stay-at-home dads who don’t feel all the same challenges, but culturally, nobody blinks when a dad goes away for a week to work on something. When the mom goes away, the question is always, Where are your kids? Who’s taking care of your kids? My husband doesn’t get asked that.\n\nMT: Right. So this idea was born…\n\nGS: So at this board meeting, we were talking about how many of us had not applied to retreats in a long time. There’s that idea in the corporate world that men make deals on the golf course and women usually aren’t invited to participate. I think it’s changing in some ways and not changing in other ways. But this, the writers’ retreat, is our industry’s golf course, in a way – you meet other writers, you form collaborations, you have this structured but unlimited time to produce your work.\n\nMT: And a welcomed break from the city.\n\nGS: I think all of us in that room said, it’d be different if we could bring our kids with us, but that just seemed so unrealistic. So Marsha [Norman], Julia, and Pia, and the whole team just started running with… well, why is it unrealistic?\n\nMT: Little did you all know, it was very realistic.\n\nGS: Some of the first family-friendly ideas we had were more about taking a pre-existing place like Williamstown or Sundance, partner with a day camp in the area, and perhaps we could provide funding for it. For example, if you go to Williamstown, you could send your kids to the day camp right next door. Out of that idea sprang this idea. Emily stepped up and said, let’s try it!\n\nMT: It’s always such a blessing to have that one person believe in trying.\n\nGS: Julia said [during the pilot program last summer] that everyone had been productive and the kids had a good time, and it was everything it was supposed to be. So we did it again. This is the first year we had open submissions from the writing community at large.\n\nMT: So you applied through that open submission process?\n\nGS: Yes. I’m here as both an artist and as a representative of the Lillys to keep an eye on the retreat to see how it’s going. But in the future, our hope is that no one from the Lillys has to come, that it’s for other artists.\n\nMT: What are you working on this week?\n\nGS: I have two projects that I’m trying to get progress made here. I’m working on The Snow Child for Arena Stage, which is mostly done but I’m doing a lot of editing and shaping work on it. Next week, I’m going to Rhinebeck Writers Retreat with Hunter Foster. He and I are working on a brand new show, so I’m trying to generate some content for that while I’m here.\n\nMT: Has it been a productive week so far?\n\nGS: For me, I’ve been very productive. I came up with a huge to-do list of tasks – compositional and organizational – that I need to get done, and I’m just knocking through them. I hear the kids running around – they’ve been at the lake, they have their grilled cheese sandwiches and their apple slices for snacks…\n\nMT: …and they’re having a dress-up class right now!\n\nGS: Yeah! There are all sorts of projects. The dress-up party is part of Louisa [Thompson]’s project. She’s a set designer and she develops children’s theater. The dressing-up has to do with helping kids identify when clothes become costumes, when they’re not just clothes, and when they’re a part of a character. She brought in a lot of costumes and is helping them build and imagine characters.\n\nMT: We peeked in earlier. The kids are having a ball. It’s like summer camp except mom is an earshot away.\n\nGS: Yeah. Earlier today, we finished lunch, and my youngest was on the hammock and she hurt her finger. She’s six years old, so she came to me crying. I said, come sit with me on the bed and we snuggled for ten minutes, and then she went on her way. Those are the things you miss when you’re not around. Somebody else would’ve comforted her, and she would’ve been fine, but being able to be her mother shouldn’t have to stop just because I’m working.\n\nMT: That’s fantastic.\n\nGS: I’m also less worried about my kids than I would be if I’d left them in the city. Everything for them stops at 6pm here. We have dinner at six, then if the adults still have the energy, they can return to work at nine or so. I guess that break wouldn’t happen if the kids weren’t here…\n\nMT: But that’s the trade off, and your kids are here!\n\nGS: Right.\n\nMT: Wait, hold on – 6pm dinner?\n\nGS: Well, I was here at Ryder Farm once before, and it was a very grown up experience. Meals were all later – that was an adjustment we made yesterday. Dinner on the first night was at seven and all the moms were like, umm…this is going to be hard.\n\nMT: So they made it earlier.\n\nGS: Yeah. All the meals are about half an hour or even an hour earlier than Ryder Farm usually does them. Breakfast here is usually at 9, and we’ve been doing it at 8, 8:30. Dinner is usually at 7 and we’ve been doing it at 6, because the kids are hungry and they don’t want to wait!\n\nMT: And I’m sure the menu is different.\n\nGS: Yes, yesterday we had a beautiful garden salad and stuffed baked potatoes, and the kids were like [mimics their blank stare]. So today they did grilled cheese and potato chips.\n\nMT: Everyone likes grilled cheese and chips. And it’s so nice to be out of the city.\n\nGS: Yeah, I don’t think the kids realize what a treat this is. They’re having a great time, but I don’t think they realize what a big deal this is. They are city kids out of the city, though. They’re scared of the crickets.\n\nMT: Of course.\n\nGS: They were like, “Mom, I can’t sleep! There’s a bug! I can hear it!” I said, “Yes, it’s outside.” There was one bug that was closer so they could hear the buzzing by their window even though it was outside.\n\nMT: But they seem to be loving it here. They’ve got so many activities planned.\n\nGS: Yeah, they’ve planned great things for them. Some of it is creative work, where the kids can create characters, write a play or songs, write a poem – some sort of creative element. This is in addition to things like swimming, and harvesting from the garden what we’re going to eat for dinner.\n\nMT: That’s amazing. I’m jealous.\n\nGS: Today, when they were out at the lake, they collected snails in a pail… I imagine they’ll return them. My kid said they saw flying fish. They’re kind of having guided nature time, which is good.\n\nMT: Getting down and dirty with nature.\n\nGS: Last night they took their baths and they’re just filthy. Filthy with farm, not filthy with New York City.\n\nMT: Clean dirt. Not city dirt.\n\nGS: Yes, it’s just dirt. Not smog and pollution.\n\n[Georgia’s daughter walks in with one of her teachers.]\n\nGS: Come sit.\n\nMT: Honey, did you name your characters?\n\nS. Brown: Yep. One’s Magnificent and one’s Maleficent. They’re sisters. I mean twins.\n\nGS: And one’s good, one’s bad?\n\nSB: Nope.\n\n[Everyone laughs.]\n\nMT: By the way, you’re a really good photographer.\n\nGS: She loves taking pictures.\n\nMT: I left the camera in there for you if you want to take more pictures.\n\nSB: I know. I’m going to go check out the puppy.\n\nMichelle Tse: How did you hear about SPACE?\n\nDeepa Purohit: I applied last year, when a friend of mine told me about it. I’m coming back here for a week on my own in September and she’s coming too. Her name is Monet Hurst-Mendoza. She’s also a writer and we actually were in the theater company I started together. We’re pretty close colleagues and she had mentioned it and so I looked it up and thought, this looks kind of cool.\n\nMT: Was it the working farm program?\n\nDP: I applied to the working farm but when I was applying I was like, Can I really be away for five weeks? It wasn’t a problem because I didn’t get into it, but they offered me a week residency, which I said yes to. I had never been on an actual retreat before, so that was my first writers’ retreat ever, and that was last July.\n\nMT: Did it change your habits of working since it was your first retreat?\n\nDP: It was great because I have never had the time to sit every day and have a routine for writing, so there were actually a few things routine-wise that I actually kept from that time. I mean, clearly I’m not able to write for eight hours a day because I work a couple other jobs to help pay the bills, but key routines have increased the amount of time I’m writing and my efficiency.\n\nMT: That’s awesome. How did you hear about the Family Residency program?\n\nDP: My husband was in this play Dry Powder that Sarah Burgess wrote here and these guys had a fundraiser. They asked him to join Sarah at the fundraiser for SPACE and asked if we would both come. Emily asked if I wanted to apply for the Family Residency and I said I was thinking about it. I applied and got in. I was considering it, initially, before she asked me, but I just wasn’t sure what my son’s schedule was going to be and when his camps were going to run. But that prompt pushed me to apply. The more I thought about it…I haven’t sent my son to sleepaway camp. I’m not that interested in being apart from him, so this is great. It’s a great opportunity.\n\nMT: And the kids have their own schedule and their own classes.\n\nDP: Yeah exactly, and it’s nice because I’m not the kind of mom that needs to be in all day activities. I like spending time with him, I like having our evenings and our meals, but I like him doing his thing.\n\nMT: What are you working on this week?\n\nDP: I’m working on a piece that I worked on last year here. It’s a very personal piece in that…I met a woman ten years ago who turned eighty this year. She’s a good friend of mine, and even a better friend now after going through this process, and she’s a Sri Lankan woman who left Sri Lanka in the 1950s, when she was about eighteen. She moved to London and hopped into the jazz scene. She was a really talented singer and piano player, and she kind of, in some ways, fell into and in some ways found her way into jazz, because her father was very passionate about jazz.\n\nMT: I already want to see this story. What’s her name?\n\nDP: Yolande Bavan. She comes from a very specific community in Sri Lanka called the Burgher community, and they’re a very mixed race group of people – they’re a mix of Tamils and Sinhalese and Dutch and Portuguese, but there’s a very European feel to their culture. When the British were there, the Burghers were actually highly educated, they were sort of that class of people that ran a lot of different sectors. Suddenly the British left and the Sinhalese took over and a lot of them left. They moved and migrated because a lot of them were worried about their status in the country so they moved to Australia and England. Some stayed, but she ended up leaving around that time because her father said, you should go to England; there’s nothing here for you here, really.\n\nMT: Wow.\n\nDP: She went to England in 1954 and she just found her way into the jazz scene. She had been listening to jazz music a lot in Sri Lanka – she would tell these stories about her dad who would get these guys, these Americans, who would come to the docks in Colombo and they’d have all these jazz records. He’d go down to the docks and trade jazz records. He introduced her to Duke Ellington and all the people who were not doing Dixieland because at that time, Dixieland was really big. They were moving into bebop and stuff like Count Basie, that were really going into this complex jazz stuff so she got really into that.\n\nMT: So she found her art and stuck with it.\n\nDP: She started acting in theater and TV and then she was, in her eyes, plucked. She ended up having this range and this ability to hear music and mimic it right away, is the short story of her coming to the States.\n\nMT: Why tell her story?\n\nDP: Her story is really interesting and the reason I’m drawn to it is because, number one, when she was doing readings and things for me, she was in her 70s playing all the mom roles in my plays. She started to tell me about her life and I was like, who’s going to tell her story? She’s been around some really famous people – she was a protege of Billie Holiday’s, she knew Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams, these big people – and in the jazz circles some people know her name but beyond that not really, and in the Sri Lankan world, definitely, she’s gone back and given concerts and things and I thought, I’m going to tell her story. But it’s not going to be a bio-play, it’s gonna be something cooler.\n\nMT: Of course.\n\nDP: So the last three years I’ve been doing interviews with her, taping them, transcribing them, writing drafts of the play, and really trying to find: what is the play? What is the story? Last summer when I was here, I was in a real block, and a friend who was here, who I met here at the farm, is an Australian playwright – she’s actually based in London now – she said, “You know what, it really sounds like you need to get Yolande, you, and the play in a room and do this exercise and just write, see what they all say to each other.” I thought, I’ll try whatever, I’m so blocked with this. I had so much material and I didn’t know what to do with it. I got them in the room and I wrote crazy amounts of material and created a play that was about creating this play and our relationship.\n\nMT: How has the piece progressed?\n\nDP: I did a reading of it in the fall of last year, and she was in it, because the whole thing was that I want her to be in what I’m writing. It was a very bizarre, meta-experience because a lot of it is about our tussles and differences around it and what we wanted this thing to be. A lot of the writing came from conversations out of which tension came, and both of us are non-confrontational, so there were very interesting dynamics. She did the reading full-heartedly and was amazing in it. It was a first-draft play and had a lot of flaws and I was ready to rewrite, and in the meantime, one of my friends said, “You need to take a break from the play and then go back to it.” And I thought, no, I can’t, she’s turning eighty. I need her to be in this play.\n\nMT: I get that though, sometimes you need a mental break.\n\nDP: I did take a break. I wrote another piece and came back to this, this summer. And as I came back to it, I realized, oh my god I’m in another block. I was having a lot of conversations with her and she was asking, what’s this play going to be? And I was not giving her the answer because I didn’t know. She had very much been saying she wanted to do a play with songs about her life, people tell me I should write a book. And I’m not going to be that person. Even though I have all the material, I don’t want to write that book. So there was a lot of that dynamic going on, and I thought, I can’t do this. I’m just going to write what she wants.\n\nSo I’m writing a cabaret of songs and her telling her story, directly addressing the audience, which is something I never wanted to do – totally traditional, whatever. I started doing that this summer through a class I was taking, and every time I walked into the class I would be like [sighs]. I was stuck again. So I thought, let’s trying having this conversation again. I brought a scene into class that was me and her having conversation, and everybody was like, whoa, that is really interesting. So now I’m back in that place, but I think I’m taking everything that I learned with me over the last three years.\n\nMT: So the piece is taking on a new form.\n\nDP: I kind of don’t trust myself at this point, because I’ve felt like this four times, but I think this is part of the process to write a play about a person you’re close to, who’s alive, who you’re interacting with all the time – we’re kind of codependent. She’s a bull and she’s been through a ton in her life and that is the honor that I want to bestow on the stage, not only the flaws between us.\n\nMT: How has your personal relationship informed and shifted the piece?\n\nDP: There are two things that happened. She took a fall about four years ago, onstage. It was a plebeian kind of fall where she missed her mark onstage and she fell backwards and missed a chair. So she went on with the show and the rest of the run but what happened in that fall was that she had crushed her entire coccyx and so she was in excruciating pain and then had to have a nine-hour surgery to reassemble her back. So for the last four years she’s been in recovery for that and she’s a woman that’s a mover and a shaker. She’s tiny, she’s always on the move – her life has always been on the move. She’s crossed oceans, and I think I realized for the first time this last summer was, oh that’s what these few years have been about, being still.\n\nAround the time she took that fall, my father passed away. He had been sick for a couple of years. I think we met at a time where we were both facing mortality in a different way. The other piece is that I’m officially realizing I’m in middle-age. That’s also about looking on the horizon thinking I’m not thirty-something and I have forever to do something, and what does that mean for me as an artist when I’ve spent the last fifteen years struggling to even define myself as an artist? I was an actor and I still do act. I wonder if I’ll act again. I write – I’m really just emerging as a writer in middle age – not really having done a lot of writing that prior to it…so there are a lot of issues around mortality for both of us that are really different. So I do imagine this piece like we’re looking in the mirror, but the mirror is open and we’re looking really at each other.\n\nMT: And it must be interesting to explore mortality in a place that is as old as this. The farm and its structures are older than the town, but everywhere you look, new life is growing around you.\n\nDP: Yeah, this house is interesting. There’s all these artifacts from all these different times. I don’t necessarily want to walk through this house because I don’t relate to it culturally, because there are all these pictures, of white people, and there’s this feeling of it being an American place, and I don’t have a legacy in that way in the United States.\n\nMT: As an immigrant, I get that.\n\nDP: If I were to walk into a stone house that was only cooled by the fact that it’s stone, and it’s concrete and people are lying their mats on the floor or they have beds or whatever, that seems more a part of my past and time. Where Yolande is interesting because she’s got so much European culture in her blood, this house would actually be quite evocative for her, even though she’s coming from a South Asian country. A lot of her life has been as an outsider, even within her own country in so many different ways. As a woman…what woman in the 1950s was leaving her country, not getting married, and going to sing jazz?\n\nMT: Unheard of, especially in Asia.\n\nDP: All these women who were in school with her were getting married, cooking curries and having kids, and that wasn’t her. So there’s a real trailblazer aspect to her and her story and I stand on her shoulders. So many of us do. And there are lots of people like her but this story is unheard.\n\nIn the Asian community, there are so many people whose shoulders we stand on but we don’t even know unless we really ask. And I would say, for me, I’ve taken it for granted, but every time I look at the material or go back to listen to her interviews…she’s like a regular person to me and we have a regular relationship that’s fraught with love and annoyances or whatever but then I’ll listen to these things and I’ll just be like…holy shit. This woman is on her own, just trailblazing, even now at the age of 80.\n\nDo you have apples? In America, over 50 million people do and Rachel Griffin’s new musical is giving voice, and music, to their suffering. The fruit in question in We Have Apples represents mental health, and recent estimates suggest that nearly 1 in 5 people have some form of mental illness. Those statistics beg the question…why aren’t we doing anything to remedy inadequate, cold, and confusing maze that they have to navigate to receive any kind of care? Enter We Have Apples. The musical centers around Jane, who suffers from anxiety and depression, as she enters a psych ward, and finds herself surrounded by people who also have apples, all different, destructive, and beautiful, like hers.\n\nWe were given the opportunity to sit in on a rehearsal the week before their concert, which premieres tonight at 54 Below, and talk to creator Rachel Griffin and the cast about their message, their experiences, and their goals; to help audiences empathize and learn about one of the most misunderstood issues in our country with authenticity, humor, and boundless imagination.\n\nKelly Wallace: You’ve had a lot of experience as a songwriter before, but this is your first musical. Why did you want to use this medium for this story?\n\nRachel Griffin : Theater gives me the ability to share a story about mental illness that starts with debilitation and suffering and ends with triumph and recovery. I think we need more stories that show that a mental health diagnosis does not mean you are doomed. I wanted to show a bunch of characters that have mental illness but are not defined by it. They are a professor, a med student, a creative writer, a musician, etc. By the end of the show, you want to be friends with them. You respect them and admire their strength. You also see how stigma and crappy healthcare affect them. Hopefully their stories will foster action and compassion!\n\nI didn’t think about writing theater until I met my husband, who is the associate music director of Aladdin and a musical theater composer. All the shows we saw together and his projects got me really excited about the power storytelling and theater. I noticed how theater can reach people and awaken something in them that might fail to awaken through other methods. Without being preachy, you can preach!\n\nI really care about mental healthcare reform and de-stigmatizing mental illness. I’m not going to run for office or work in healthcare, but I can use creativity and music to help. I started writing this show on my iPhone and I was writing it out of frustration with my own mental healthcare experiences and the stigma I faced and saw others face. I was afraid to let the show out of my iPhone because I knew if I shared it then people would probably figure I had a mental health condition. Then it dawned on me that stigma was stopping me from sharing it. Stigma is powerful. I realized if what I was writing could help people, it was worth being vulnerable. I think writing about what we fear can lead to our best writing. I still resist it, but I want to be brave. We have this one life, I think it’s important to remember that and be bold and as fearless as possible with our writing. It still scares me, though!\n\nKW: As you said, it is so personal. Did you find the editing and cutting process was hard for you because of how close to home the story is?\n\nRG: Yeah! Once in awhile someone says, “You know, I don’t think this part is realistic,” and it’s literally something that I’ve experienced in real life with the mental health care system. It’s so bad that people don’t believe it as fiction. That’s crazy! As some of my mentors have recommended, like Larry O’Keefe and Michael Korie, sometimes I make a change someone suggests, but I make it in a way that makes sense to me but might not be exactly what they thought was right. I love that theater is collaborative. I love when an actor will email me and say, you know, I don’t think my character would say exactly that, what do you think about this? Just to take that in and be like, you know, let me think about that. It’s been incredible, because composing can be kind of lonely. So with theater, you have this community. I feel extremely blessed to have the people we do involved with this show because they bring so much. One mind alone is so much less powerful than a bunch of different perspectives.\n\nKW: When did you decide to have Depression be a physical presence onstage as a person?\n\nRG: It wasn’t in the first draft. The show is based on a short story I wrote in undergrad about a girl in therapy. In the short story her thoughts were shouted in capitals. We all have that voice in our head, whether we have depression or not, that says you’re not good enough. We all have that fight or flight reflex that we don’t need going off all the time anymore, because a lion isn’t going to jump out at us. I don’t think we talk about that voice too much, I don’t think we talk about those weird or scary thoughts. I thought it would be cool to have a character who was saying those things so the audience can realize that other people have those thoughts, too. I played with the idea of having an offstage voice say it and then moved to having a character. I like that the character, at first was one-sided and was just the darkness, and then I was like, I couldn’t write this show if I didn’t have the imagination I have. Having such a vivid imagination can look like anxiety, racing thoughts.. but it also can look like creativity and music and empathy.. so depression and anxiety and mental illness have beauty in them, and that’s something I’ve always wanted to show. A lot of media show only the bad stuff, which we need and we need to see the struggle that is a reality for many, but we also need the beauty, the hope, the brilliance. So, I thought, maybe I could also make this character be the source of imagination and have that there too. It’s been cool too, because a lot of people’s favorite character in the piece is Depression and I’m like, oh, I thought everybody would hate her! She’s the antagonist. And I’ve had people come up after presentations and say, “I just love Depression!” And I’m like…”Okay!” That’s… great!\n\nKW: What do you hope that audiences take from the show? When someone comes to see this, what do you want them to leave with?\n\nRG: I want them to see that people with mental health conditions are their doctors, their friends, their teachers, people they admire. I want people to realize mental healthcare is inadequate and inaccessible and that causes suicide. I want people to see how isolating it is to have people respond with silence and shame to an illness. When a friend of the family is in the hospital with a physical illness, people bring pies and cards. When they are there for a mental illness, people disappear.\n\nWe can’t have all the shame and the silence, because it really does corrode the human spirit. People really lose lives because of it. We need to talk about it in the open so it evolves to not be so uncomfortable. Mental health should be taught in schools along with physical health in health class. I think many teenagers think their pain is permanent. They need to be aware of symptoms, treatments, and stories of hope.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nHannah Elless: I play Jane and she is a young woman that is aspiring to go to college and all the normal things that a young woman aspires to. She’s a writer, she’s creative, she really has a lot of great energy and yet she has this duality about her that she’s constantly coming to terms with. In the show, they call that character Depression, which is personified by Emily, who plays Depression. So it’s pretty interesting to have that, since the audience can see both of these characters having a conversation with each other, when in reality it’s Jane having a conversation in her mind and fighting, sometimes fighting and sometimes agreeing. That’s what’s lovely about the show. We’re looking at Depression not as an enemy but as sort of a friend in a way. Maybe a friend that doesn’t always help you make good choices, but we’re definitely looking at it as part of who Jane is inherently, and not something that she despises, but something she’s constantly trying to reconcile within herself.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nHE: I just think it’s so important that we’re having a dialogue about mental health and putting it into a musical is so smart. What the writers have done to bring this to the surface of everybody’s minds is really commendable. I think my viewpoint has changed in a great way. Being able to work with this company, and explore who Jane is – I think the point is that as an actor you always want to play these great roles and the point of Jane is that she’s just a normal girl. That’s what surprised me the most, reading through her character and her songs and her singing. She wants all the things any girl wants. So there’s something different and lovely about her, but there’s also something so normal and relatable because she’s just a girl.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nHE: I think it’s because when you sit through this show, you feel like you really know these people. After sitting through a concert or a full production of this hopefully someday, you really feel like you know Jane. You feel like you know Avery and Charlie and Alex and all these characters and by the end of the show they’re your neighbors, your brother, your sister, your mom, your dad…you start relating to these people and realize they’re people in your life. It makes it really safe to talk about mental illness in a way that’s funny and heartbreaking and completely serious sometimes. They hit all spectrums of the emotional journey. That’s what is great about this show too. They let you laugh and they let you cry and there’s no right or wrong, it’s just exploring who these people are and their specific journeys in life.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nEmily Nash: I play Depression, who is the personification of Jane’s mental illness. It’s kind of larger than that; it also embodies her OCD, her anxiety, but also her creativity and her protection. So, it’s all of the good and bad aspects that come from mental illness. So, I’m the personification of all of that, and I appear as a person, but I’m really just a figment, not of her imagination, but of what’s going on in her mind. You’re seeing everything from the inside out, which I think is really cool. I love this role; I think it’s really great to get the chance to play this.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nEN: I’ve always been passionate about the topic. I actually just lost my grandmother to depression a few weeks ago, so it feels especially powerful now to be working on this. I feel like I’m giving voice to her story in a way that…it feels great to have ownership of that story. I myself have struggled with anxiety my whole life, just generalized anxiety, which has at times manifested itself in depressive episodes. So, definitely not to the extent that Jane experiences it in the show, but I so relate. Singing a song about having a panic attack? That’s not something I have to get into someone else’s shoes and figure out what that feels like. I know what that feels like.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nEN: It’s the best medium because we’re getting people in a room together talking about this. We’re not hiding behind a movie screen, this is live and in the flesh. People are going to respond in different ways, but I just really hope that people will grow to become more vocal about this and not stay silent, because it is something that plagues so many people.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nMeagan Hodson: I’m playing Charlie. Her illness has evolved with the character. I used to be Martha and she was older, so she’s evolved back into a twenty-something. She’s relatively new to the psych ward because she has just been turned down with all her cries for help and not getting what she needed, so she did something drastic and hurt herself to finally get admitted. And then, I think, a couple weeks passed by and the insurance company said, “Alright, you’re good, you’re fine, you’re free to go.” She’s not ready, and she’s terrified, and she ends her life. Which is hard, and it’s that one character. Unfortunately, it feels very necessary. It’s such a, not common, but it is an outcome that happens. It’s the reality of it. Not to make it a statement, but to make it realistic. That’s something they’re trying to combat, trying to get better, and sometimes it doesn’t work out.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nMH: I think it really opened my eyes a little bit more to how much stigma there is. Because, I think growing up, we don’t have as much interaction with people, or if we do, it’s a little more quiet. There’s a separation. But I never realized there was a huge discriminatory element to it until I really thought about it. There’s not a lot of talk about it in the media. And more people are coming out and talking about it, which is such a big deal, but it shouldn’t be such a big deal. It should be common place.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nMH: Well, I really love theater for social change, just because I think you can say things without it being so direct. It seems more of an artistic way to present it, but it still can be very real and start conversations. So you don’t feel like you’re being lectured the whole time; you’re immersing yourself into a story and a character and then you realize that really says something to you personally as well, or about someone you know. There’s that wall that helps to ease into that for other people.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nAndrew Kober: I play a character named Alex, he’s manic. He’s sort of the bright shining face of the psych ward. He’s excited about everything that happens there. He’s a source for positivity and ultimately for organization and his illness manifests itself in a way that can be a positive influence on the rest of the ward. Does that sound like an intelligent answer? I’m faking it.\n\nKW: It does! How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nAK: Rarely do you see stories where people with different mental illnesses co-exist in this way. I mean, there’s really, at least in this kind of condensed version of it…yes, it’s about one character’s struggle, but it’s about all sorts of backgrounds coming together to support the storytelling. What it’s done for me more than anything, is to say that everyone has a story to tell. It’s a great reminder that there is absolutely no story that is not worth telling, exploring, delving into. There is absolutely something theatrical and beautiful to be mined in anyone’s experience and their journey.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nAK: I’ll tell you why. For lack of a better way of putting it, you can’t leave. It’s there. It’s in front of you. It’s live, happening in front of your face. You can’t disconnect from it in the way that you can with some other art forms. Social constructs say you can’t check your phone in the middle of it, you can’t run to the bathroom in the middle of it. You’re there, and it’s happening to humans in front of your human eyes. I think that adds an immediacy and raises the stakes to the conversation.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nTamika Lawrence: I play Avery, she’s one of the patients in the ward. She’s there because she’s been dealing with a lot of body issues and with bulimia.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nTL: It hasn’t, actually, because I am pretty familiar with a little bit of it because I think living in the city and being around so many people who don’t have access to mental care in this country makes you aware. Doing research and also, you know, being here makes you invest in things like therapy, just to stay healthy and take care of yourself. But I’m very happy that she’s doing this piece to bring awareness to all of this, because a lot of people don’t have that experience.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nTL: I think because theater is accessible; theater is enjoyable. For issues that might be hard, such as mental illness, or even politics, things that are hot button topics, I think theater helps to build the conversation on both sides. Whether you agree with what’s being presented or not, I think it helps to make it palatable.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nBrian Graziani: I play Jonah. Rachel just incorporated Jonah into the show recently, so I’ve had a lot of wiggle room to do whatever I want. I chose me – there’s not really a single difference between the two of us.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nBG: You know, this is my fourth time doing the show in various stages. I realized doing it the first time that I suffer from a mental illness. It wasn’t until that first scene, seeing the way that depression is personified, it’s very jarring. It was very eye-opening in regards to some of the trials and tribulations I’ve been through myself and how I cope with them, especially those little voices we all hear. I went from there and was diagnosed with depression, so this changed my life.\n\nKW: And why theater? Why is this such a powerful medium for changing people’s’ minds and getting them to really think about this issue?\n\nBG: I think art in general, especially onscreen or onstage, is just a very passive way of communicating about social issues. It feels less preachy, because we’re invested in a story. We’re looking at a person, rather than a direct lecture on how we cope with an issue. It’s not a political statement, you think, but then subconsciously, hopefully, the piece teaches us something and gives us some shape of life and some taste of this heightened version of reality. I would like to think that’s what this piece and theater in general can do.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nMichael Winther: My character’s name is Bill, and he has a really beautiful song about losing his wife and kids. This is one of those things where it’s like SWAT Team theater, where you sweep in and do this for creatives so they can see what they have. Being on both sides of that, because I’ve worked as a writer on my own stuff as well, I always love to do it as much as I can.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nMW: It’s a bit of an anthology kind of piece. Everyone has their stories. I definitely have history of mental illness in my family; I had a cousin who was undiagnosed on the spectrum and schizophrenia and he ended up dying very young. He was like 40. He had another brother, my other cousin, who committed suicide. There’s a lot of that on my mother’s side of the family. I think everybody has some kind of personal experience with this. With a piece like this, you start talking about it and like many things, you think you’re the only one or it’s unusual, because we don’t talk about it. It’s important to talk about. The country in general, and the United States in general, is moving towards having less shame about mental illness, I hope.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s’ minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nMW: It’s the reason why I wanted to go out on tour with a show like Fun Home. Like this, it’s about an issue that matters and there’s something about your having an encounter with an actual person. You have to show up as an audience member, especially in musical theater, the voice literally hits your body. I think it’s a really great thing to try and find a way to tell this story about mental illness and depression with music. Non-musical theater people always scoff, “You’re going to make a musical out of that?” But it’s the same thing with Hamilton . At first, you’re like, “Really? That? I can’t believe it.” But it’s those shows that – not all of them break through – but when all the pieces work together, it’s transcendent. It transforms people in a non-intellectual way, which is I think what we all want to do. At least for me, that’s what I care about. It’s great to see a lot of musicals now that tackle weightier issues, which doesn’t mean they’re downers, like Evan Hansen , they just have a mission along with the story they’re telling. Even if you look back… The King and I, Oklahoma, Carousel… they have some really heavy stuff in it. There’s a bit of that in musical theater, always. I did Mamma Mia on Broadway the year of the Republican National Convention and it was on the list of “approved shows” to go see, until an advance person came to see it and they’re like, “There’s a story about an unwed mother and there’s a gay guy in this, this is no longer on the Republican okay list.” So the delegates knew what was “okay” to see. Things have changed a lot since then, of course. So we were shocked. There would be these Republicans who would come and say things like, “Don’t tell anybody I’m here but we really had a great time.” You’re like, really? This show? We live in a bubble in New York and we think, oh, this is no big deal.\n\nKelly Wallace: Tell me about your character.\n\nColeman Hemsath: Orien is his name. So he is not really in the whole psych ward at all, he is the son of the guy who runs it. He’s on the outside looking in at all the “crazies,” even though he really relates to them. He relates to the main character because they both are very out of touch with modern-day things and ways to connect. They connect when they’re both like, “Wow, we don’t get anything; wow, we’re the same person because we don’t understand anything in the real world.” So even though he’s from the outside looking in, he’s still a part of that whole idea that he feels like an outcast.\n\nKW: How has working on this piece changed or informed your views on mental illness?\n\nCH: I’ve never really thought about the inner workings of a psych ward or how people interact with other people who are in the psych ward at the same time. I think it’s really cool that you get to see that, you get to hear people communicate, and you see this girl start at the beginning and go through this whole journey. It’s really terrible at the end when people leave in all this debt or leave without a plan on what to do, it’s very eye-opening and things that I’d never even thought about before. If you do have exposure to that environment, people don’t always want to talk about it. I feel like this is great, because it makes more people able to talk about it, since I feel like it touches a lot of people’s families.\n\nKW: Why do you think theater is such a powerful medium for telling this kind of story and to help change people’s minds and erase some of the stigmas associated with mental illness?\n\nCH: I think theater in general makes people talk, even with uncomfortable topics such as this. So therefore, I think this gives people the opportunity to bring it up. You generally won’t just sit down with someone and say, “Hey, let’s talk about mental illness.” This, seeing the show or watching the YouTube video, will give them the springboard to start talking about it if it’s a conversation they want to have.\n\nPlaywright Richard Strand’s Butler is an outstanding, captivating, important play about race relations – part historical drama and part biography. In wake of the 2016 summer shootings in Louisiana, Minnesota, Dallas, and elsewhere, the issues debated in Butler about Black equality are extremely timely.\n\nA simple act of defiance or a “why not?” decision can be a catalyst for change. For example, on December 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, African American civil rights activist Rosa Parks challenged a bus driver, refusing to give up her seat to a white man, thereby making a stand against an unjust segregation law. And, on November 9, 1989, a Berlin checkpoint captain, Harald Jäger, decided to open the Berlin Wall gates, effectively ending the Cold War.\n\nIn Butler, the play focuses on such a moment in history — another catalyst — a moment that helped enact a sea change for racial equality. On May 23, 1861 at Fort Monroe, Virginia, three courageous fugitive slaves – Shepard Mallory, Frank Baker and James Townsend – and a shrewd politic Major General Benjamin Franklin Butler worked in tandem in unexpected ways to set in motion the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862.\n\nFort Monroe, Virginia is central in the momentous events, which altered history for people of color – actually two specific histories. Ironically, in August 1619, this exact location was where the first Africans (20 African captives) set foot on the North American continent and where slavery first was established. Almost 250 years later, the Union-held Virginia Fort Monroe was where the three refugee slaves sought sanctuary from the Confederacy. They escaped from the Confederate-held post of Big Bethel, Virginia, eight miles away.\n\nA key event to these Virginia locations being pivotal was the Confederacy Act the day before (May 22, 1861). Virginia seceded from the Union and became essentially a “foreign country.” Laws particular to the United States of America no longer applied to the Confederate States, including The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Butler, both a military man and lawyer in civil life, recognized the judicial loophole and took action to establish a way and means by which slaves did not have to be returned to the Confederacy and their “owners,” and, in fact, could become part of the Union army.\n\nButler is not just a story about one man, but two – Benjamin Butler (Ames Adamson) and Shepard Mallory (John G. Williams). However important the other two slaves who sought asylum were, their contributions are back-story in the play, and the other two slaves are never seen. It is through Butler’s and Mallory’s meetings, conversations and decisions that caused the dominos to fall and change history.\n\nBesides Butler and Mallory, Union Lt. Kelly (Benjamin Sterling) and Confederate Major Cary (David Stiller) are an integral part of the drama. Joseph Discher (Director) has inspired exceptional performances from all four actors, each channeling their characters in distinct ways.\n\nThe two main actors, Butler and Mallory, square off against each other in an admirable battle of wits, circling each other with one rhetoric jab after another. Butler has never had a conversation with a black man. Mallory, a learned man, surprises Butler with his eruditeness. Butler becomes more and more intrigued by Mallory’s knowledge of and use of words. Butler is an absorbing boxing match on which historical revisions are not based on rabbit punches, but verbal feints.\n\nButler, a lawyer and aspiring politician, weighs words more carefully than most military men. The opening scene of the play establishes how words and their importance come into play. Butler demands that words be precise. Astonished is different from being surprised. A request is considered being polite; a demand is not. Butler takes offense at having demands made of him.\n\nI spoke with Ames Adamson and John G. Williams about the moment in the play that stands out to them the most:\n\nAmes Adamson (Butler): “Mallory’s entrance into Butler’s office and Mallory and Butler regarding each other. Butler has never been confronted by a slave before. I am sure Butler has seen them, but not in such close proximity as a man. And Mallory is standing almost exactly as Butler is standing. And looking Butler straight in the eye. Mallory and Butler regard each other. And I think that’s a very powerful moment. And then Mallory, of course, tells what’s happened to him. But when Mallory shows Butler the scars on his back, Butler sees that this is a “man,” a human who has been tortured. And that sets the dominos falling.”\n\nJohn Williams (Mallory): “In piggy-backing on what Ames just said, for me, a significant moment for my character [Mallory] in his journey he takes throughout the play is the line, ‘You find me interesting, don’t you?’ The line comes at the same scene that Ames just referred to … I feel that Mallory has been waiting his whole life to give a confession about the person that he is. And, he has found a willing listener. Someone who wants to know him. The way that [Butler] takes that in and says ‘thank you.’ It’s sort of weighted. Nobody has ever found [Mallory] interesting before. He knows that he is interesting but nobody has ever seen it. And Butler sees it. From that point on Mallory feels he can work with [Butler].”\n\nStrand structures their discussions with comedic panache – ping pong exchanges with each trying to one up the other. Discher directs their back and forth debates with fast-paced humor. Discher carefully choreographs their meetings of mind and quick witted conversations so that they escalate into a growing trust of each other and camaraderie.\n\nAdamson portrays Butler as a man not to be toyed – brazen, confident, with a tad of hubris. Adamson highlights Butler’s pride in securing a military general’s commission, but also aptly conveys his assuredness and his abilities as a canny attorney.\n\nWilliams’ Mallory counters Butler effectively, depicting Mallory as a complex, quick-change artist, who can easily swing between being impertinent, cocksure, guarded, hotheaded, and clever – at a moment’s notice. Mallory gets away (except in one instance) with slyly making sport of Butler, without crossing the line.\n\nAs their guarded relationship grows into mutual respect, Butler comments: “You are a collection of contradictions. You’re brash but wary. I don’t even know how it’s possible to be both of those things at once. You seem, I don’t know, scared and overly confident at the same time. You’re humble and arrogant at once. It’s quite remarkable.”\n\nMallory recognizes first how ”not unlike” they are, when he proclaims: “It’s because I remind you of you. It’s because I’m just like you.”\n\nAnd, it is Mallory who maintains, and even plants a seed with Butler: “I heard a good lawyer can always use convoluted reasoning to find a loophole.”\n\nButler’s right-hand is Lt. Kelly, who shifts from being on the fence as to what to do about Mallory to taking Mallory’s side. Benjamin Sterling subtly captures Lt. Kelly’s belief shift in whether or not to like this Black man, to changing his opinion and to trying to champion him. Sterling maintains the air of puzzled complaisance as his change towards Mallory evolves.\n\nDavid Stiller takes on the difficult role of the Confederate Major Cary – conveying both superciliousness and ignorance.\n\nAs Butler comes to like Mallory, Butler grudgingly begins to agree there may be ways to bend the law in Mallory’s favor, and Butler devises a way to shrewdly use language in the service of justice.\n\nA pivotal plot point occurs when Confederate Major Cary confronts Butler and reads a document drafted by his superior, Confederate Colonel Charles Mallory:\n\n“You have, in your possession, property belonging to Colonel Charles Mallory of the Sovereign State of Virginia. Specifically, you are sheltering three runaway slaves: Shepard Mallory, Frank Baker and James Townsend. We ‘demand’ that you release those slaves to the custody of Major John B. Cary, also of of the Sovereign State of Virginia, as is appropriate under the Constitution of the United States, and the universal A"
