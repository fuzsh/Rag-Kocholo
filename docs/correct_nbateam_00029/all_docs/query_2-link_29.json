        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA smooth and above-average scorer, he displayed a solid mid-range game and excellent athleticism. Was always explosive going to the hoop and could get by his man with ease and jump over some defenders. Was also a solid man-to-man defender. Showcased plenty of experience and a well-rounded game. Drove the lane a lot less with advanced age, and leaned too heavily on his three-point shot. Could be prone to slumps. Was not a big rebounder or help defender, and would too often register a foul rather than make a big stop. Was also not an accurate shooter from behind the arc, despite regular attempts."
