They do, however, believe that the shooting may have been gang-related.\n\n\"The victim was well liked in the community and investigators believe he was targeted solely because of his race,\" the statement said.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday, LASD detectives and Jefferson's family asked for anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\"He was a brother, a son, a father and a grandfather,\" said Kenneth Jefferson. \"He was very much loved.\"\n\nRichard Jefferson, who was born in Los Angeles had a 17-year NBA career in which he played for the New Jersey Nets, Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and most notably the Cleveland Cavaliers, with whom he won an NBA Championship with in 2016.\n\nSince retiring, Jefferson has becoming well-known as a basketball analyst with FS1, ESPN and the PAC-12 Network.\n\nAnyone with information on the incident was urged to contact investigators at (323) 890-5500."
