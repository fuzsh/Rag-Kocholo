This is the second year of our data collection and we’ll be revisiting the same spots to see what’s changed. This project helps us see how biodiversity at the park changes over time.\n\nSign up!\n\nWe’re looking for volunteers (age 14+) to help our science team collect as much data as possible. Volunteer activities include: 1) helping the scientists make observations and take notes at each plot; 2) bringing plant samples and other supplies to and from the plot to the plant identification station; 3) identifying plants in the plots or at the identification station; and 4) talking to visitors who might have questions about what’s going on (additional info about the activities will be provided). No prior experience or knowledge about plants is needed.\n\nSign up!\n\nOur science team will be surveying plants on Saturday, June 15 from 8 am to 4 pm. (If it rains, we'll be there Saturday, June 29 from 8 am - 4 pm).\n\nVolunteer time slots are from:\n\n- 8 am to 10 am\n\n- 10 am to noon\n\n- Noon to 2 pm\n\n- 2 pm to 4 pm\n\nWe will be working out in the restored wetland areas so you’ll be working in direct sun and in possibly soggy areas. We recommend wearing rubber boots or shoes you don’t mind getting dirty and wet. We will be walking in taller grass and bugs might be out so you may be more comfortable in long pants. Other supplies to consider bringing include sunscreen, a hat, bug spray*, a water bottle, and snacks.\n\n* Please apply bug spray in the parking lot so you don't harm our beneficial bugs!\n\nView Event →\n\nChampagne Brunch\n\nTeaneck Creek Conservancy's annual fundraising event is back with a twist!

Cooper tells the story of his extraordinary life leading up to the now-infamous encounter in Central Park and shows how a life spent looking up at the birds prepared him, in the most uncanny of ways, to be a gay, Black man in America today.\n\nJoin the Eco Book Club Facebook Group for members, prospective members, and friends to share related information, articles, books, events, etc. here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/ecobookclubteaneck\n\nSupport TCC’s nature programming by donating to TCC or becoming a TCC member.\n\nBorrow a book and register with the library.\n\nView Event →\n\nCome Paint in the Park\n\nCome out to Teaneck Creek to paint in the park on the last Sunday of the month!
