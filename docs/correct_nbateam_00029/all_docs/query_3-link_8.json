        "text": "RC (DNA: RG 59, LAR); at foot of text: âPresident of the United Statesâ; endorsed by TJ as received 28 Mch. and so recorded in SJL.\n\nJames Linn (1750â1821) was born in New Jersey, the son of Alexander Linn, an Irish immigrant who became a prominent judge in Somerset County. A Princeton graduate, Linn studied law and in 1771 married Mary Livingston, daughter of New Jersey Governor William Livingston. Linn served as a major in the militia during the Revolutionary War, practiced law, and was active in state politics. In 1790 he was elected to the state legislature and in 1793 became a leader of the Republican movement in New Jersey. In 1798 he won election to Congress as a Republican from a Federalist district. Viewed as the swing vote in the fivemember New Jersey delegation during the vote for president in the House of Representatives, Linn declared his support for TJ. In June 1801, TJ appointed him supervisor of the revenue for the New Jersey district. As a prominent political organizer in the state, Linn published weekly essays for the Republican cause. His election as secretary of New Jersey in 1805, a position he held until 1820, strengthened his control of the party in the state (Biog. Dir. Cong.; Harrison, Princetonians, 1769â1775, description begins Richard A. Harrison, Princetonians, 1769â1775: A Biographical Dictionary, Princeton, 1980 description ends 28â31)."
