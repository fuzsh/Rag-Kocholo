        "text": "With the NBA on hiatus — which NBA commissioner Adam Silver set at 30 days — and New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, placing a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people for the foreseeable future due to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, no Brooklyn Nets games will be played for the time being.\n\nFor the Nets, as much as any team, this comes at an odd time — Brooklyn was battling the Orlando Magic for the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference standings. At the stoppage of play, the Nets had a half-game advantage over the Magic.\n\nSince there aren’t any games, each day Nets Wire will highlight major individual performances and key developments throughout Nets history:\n\nRichard Jefferson threw down plenty of big dunks throughout his seven-year Nets career. During New Jersey’s March 28, 2003 visit to Madison Square Garden, it seemed like the forward wanted to get as many dunks out of his system as possible.\n\nJefferson finished with 39 points on 16-for-22 shooting. He also went 7-for-7 at the free-throw line, grabbed six rebounds and dished out four assists in the Nets’ 122-101 win over the New York Knicks (full box score).\n\n“The ballboy asked me for my shoes at halftime, which they’ll do sometimes, and I said: ‘No, I’ve got another half to play. I can’t give these up. I’m feeling it tonight,”’ Jefferson said after the win.\n\nKenyon Martin scored 25 points for New Jersey and Jason Kidd had a whopping 16 assists."
