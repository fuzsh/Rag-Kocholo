        "text": "Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nRichard Jefferson appeared to end his NBA career with a championship.\n\nJefferson helped the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors, 93-89, in Game 7 of the NBA Finals on Sunday with two points, nine rebounds and one steal. He then said on Fox Sports Ohio (via Keith Britton of 92.3 The Fan in Cleveland): “I am retiring.”\n\nMichael Grange of Sportsnet shared some more of Jefferson’s reaction following the game:\n\nFox Sports Ohio passed along the extended version of his interview, where Jefferson even discussed his plans to write essays during his spare time in retirement:\n\nHowever, at the Cavaliers' celebration parade, Jefferson told the crowd he will play next season, per Jason Lloyd of the Akron Beacon Journal.\n\nJefferson initially hinted he may be backtracking on his decision to retire on The Dan Patrick Show, per Andrew Perloff on Wednesday:\n\nJefferson was solid for Cleveland in seven games against the 73-win Warriors, averaging 5.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals per night behind 51.6 percent shooting from the field. He primarily came off the bench as part of the second unit, but he started Game 3 when Kevin Love couldn’t play because of a concussion. Jefferson nearly tallied a double-double with nine points and eight rebounds in a 120-90 win.\n\nThe 36-year-old would get to do what many dream of and go out on top after his performance.\n\nJefferson entered the league in 2001 as a first-round draft pick out of Arizona and played for the New Jersey Nets, Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks and Cavaliers in his career. He appeared in 1,082 regular-season games and averaged 13.3 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists per contest.\n\nHe also reached the Finals twice with New Jersey but lost both times (2002 to the Los Angeles Lakers and 2003 to the San Antonio Spurs).\n\nWhile he was a role player for the Cavaliers, he was a primary piece during his prime on the Nets. He averaged more than 22 points per game twice in his career and was a matchup problem with his athleticism:\n\nRichard Jefferson's Prime Years SeasonTeamPoints per GameAssists per GameRebounds per Game2002-03New Jersey Nets15.52.56.42003-04New Jersey Nets18.53.85.72004-05New Jersey Nets22.24.07.32005-06New Jersey Nets19.53.86.82006-07New Jersey Nets16.32.74.42007-08New Jersey Nets22.63.14.22008-09Milwaukee Bucks19.62.44.6\n\nSource: ESPN.com"
