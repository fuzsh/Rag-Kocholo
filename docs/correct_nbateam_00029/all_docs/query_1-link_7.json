        "text": "They had arrived at the drip-drip-drip segment of the season, both teams were going nowhere and knew it, so now it was time for Richard Jefferson to play the \"What If?\" game.\n\nAs in: What would have happened if the Nets' rebuilding plan took a more conservative route, and they stood pat by retaining two starting forwards named Nenad Krstic and Richard Jefferson while using the draft to fortify their otherwise weak frontcourt?Yes, it was a serious question.\n\nCaveat lector: One cannot be certain whether the following is a serious answer.\n\n\"Umm ... Nenad Krstic, mentally, probably would still be struggling,\" Jefferson replied solemnly Monday night, when the Bucks visited Izod Center for the final time. \"And I probably would have killed somebody by now.\"\n\nWow, he must have loved it in Jersey.\n\n\"That's 100 percent honest,\" Jefferson continued. \"Yes, the team would probably be a little bit better, but ultimately would they be that contending team? Probably not. There's too many things...\"\n\nBy now, everyone knows what those things are, at least the issues pertaining to Jefferson himself. The serious answer would have been about relationship.\n\nTo wit: The Vince Carter-RJ partnership had run its course. And, more importantly, the Lawrence Frank-RJ partnership had run its course -- hence, the homicide fantasy. (\"It could have very easily been\" a reporter, Jefferson added).\n\nBut Jefferson was no longer compatible to the rest of group, and everybody knew it.\n\nSo on the fateful afternoon of June 26, 2008, team president Rod Thorn -- a fairly daring fellow when it comes to trades -- pulled the trigger, irrevocably changing his team by shipping Jefferson to Milwaukee for Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons.\n\nThe Nets tried their best to justify it as more than a salary dump, claiming that Yi is \"a very special player,\" which hasn't exactly been the case. They wouldn't use the term \"rebuild,\" either; they called it \"retooling.\"\n\nIn the end, they can only be sure of this: Jefferson has averaged 19 points and 4.5 rebounds in an off year; and while Simmons is a solid backup and a professional presence, Yi is one year away from washing out entirely.\n\nBut Jefferson didn't want to go there. And even though Krstic has played very well for Oklahoma City lately -- the Serbian forward is averaging 11 points and six boards since become a starter 19 games ago, and would fit superbly in the Nets offense -- that's where Jefferson steered his skeptical analysis.\n\n\"His mental was just as bad as his physical by the time he went\" home, Jefferson said. \"Not saying anything negative about Nenad, but he mentally couldn't get over that hump with the knee injury. He's playing well for the Thunder. But again, I think going back home helped to get his mind clear, it feels like a fresh start. And I think he's going to get better.\"\n\nAs for his implication that he personally had to get out of Jersey, Jefferson did an abrupt about-face: \"Naw, naw, naw,\" he said. Killing someone \"doesn't mean I had to get out.\n\n\"I feel that if I was here, I'd try to contribute in a positive way. So just insert my numbers, and you guys can do the rest.\"\n\nIndeed, the math speaks for itself. The Nets' starting forward combo over the second half of the season -- Yi and Trenton Hassell -- average only 13 points and eight rebounds combined.\n\nThe Bucks weren't necessarily happy with what they got either, but Jefferson has been far better in the second half of the season after reporting to camp in less than peak condition. Regardless of his output, Milwaukee's season was doomed as soon as Michael Redd tore his ACL, and sneaking into the final playoff berth would prove impossible after Andrew Bogut was lost to a back problem.\n\nThey were a team to be taken seriously right after the All-Star break, when they won a road game at Detroit to pull within two games of .500. Since then, the Bucks are 4-14.\n\nSo for the second straight time in his career, Jefferson knows he is going home before the postseason begins.\n\n\"It's tough,\" he said. \"You appreciate those early years. There was no point in time when anything was taken for granted. I remember we made the playoffs that one year on the very last game of the season. So you understand what it takes to get there, and how you have to play all 82 games.\n\n\"But for me it's been a different situation. You're supposed to come out here and continue to play hard and these guys have played their butts off. We have been playing as hard as we can. We haven't played as well as we would have liked. But guys have put it out there.\""
