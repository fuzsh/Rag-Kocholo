        "text": "Richard Jefferson has come to terms on a deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers, per an announcement from the team. It is likely a one year, veteran's minimum deal, though it isn't the policy of the team (in accordance with league rules) to disclose the terms of the contract.\n\nJefferson had originally agreed to return to Dallas, but with DeAndre Jordan returning to the Clippers, the Mavericks allowed their free agents the ability to explore other options. For Jefferson, the opportunity to compete for an NBA championship was likely appealing.\n\nFrom the team:\n\nIn 2014-15, Jefferson played in 74 games (18 starts) for the Mavericks, averaging 5.8 points on .444 shooting, including a .426 clip from beyond the arc, and 2.5 rebounds in 16.8 minutes per game.\n\nJefferson will likely start the season as LeBron James' backup. If he can play smart defense to counter his limited athleticism at age 35 while spacing the floor, the Cavs will get their money's worth. Jefferson is not a game changer at this point in his career, but he might push the needle just a bit. This is the second year in a row the Cavs have added a Dallas small forward; Shawn Marion was helpful at times but wore down. The Cavs will hopefully be able to manage Jefferson's minutes so that he can contribute if need be come playoff time."
