        "text": "Virginia was the ground in which Jefferson planned to plant the roots of his ideal republic. Jefferson's broad vision of a republican society encompassed governmental, cultural, educational, and societal institutions and activities. In his view, Virginia's political, legal, and educational systems were to be reformed and molded into an ideal republican society as a model for America and Europe.\n\nOnce independence was virtually certain, Jefferson desperately wanted to help draft a new constitution for Virginia. The establishment of a government better than that of the past was, he said, “the whole object of the present controversy.” Jefferson also actively attempted to reform the Virginia's laws on crime, inheritance, religion, education, and the slave trade.\n\nLike many admirers of the Enlightenment, Jefferson was convinced that science and the scientific method held the keys to learning and education in the broadest sense. Jefferson promoted studies of natural history, botany, archeology, and architecture. His extensive library, the largest personal one in the United States by 1815, was a testament to his conviction that all subjects of learning fell within the purview of all learned men.\n\nPrivately educated in grammar schools, the College of William and Mary, and primarily the world of books, Thomas Jefferson was an ardent advocate of public education as a cornerstone of a free republican society. Throughout his life Jefferson promoted reform in public education as a prerequisite for an enduring republican nation. The founding of the University of Virginia (chartered in 1819) was the capstone of Jefferson's educational advocacy, and he devoted most of the last decade of his life to its establishment and well-being."
