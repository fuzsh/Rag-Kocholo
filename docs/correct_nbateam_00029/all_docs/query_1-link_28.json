        "text": "With the NBA on hiatus — which NBA commissioner Adam Silver set at 30 days — and New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, placing a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people for the foreseeable future due to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, no Brooklyn Nets games will be played for the time being.\n\nFor the Nets, as much as any team, this comes at an odd time — Brooklyn was battling the Orlando Magic for the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference standings. At the stoppage of play, the Nets had a half-game advantage over the Magic.\n\nSince there aren’t any games, each day Nets Wire will highlight major individual performances and key developments throughout Nets history:\n\nMarch 31, 2003 was a special night for Richard Jefferson at Continental Airlines Arena.\n\nWith Yao Ming and the Houston Rockets in town, the second-year New Jersey forward put on one of his best performances in a Nets uniform. Jefferson reached the 30-point mark for the second time in three games (39 on 3/28 against the New York Knicks) — also the second time in his NBA career, for that matter.\n\nHe finished with 11 assists, marking the first time he ever logged double-digit assists in an NBA game. And, to round things out, Jefferson had 10 boards — marking the forward’s first career triple-double."
