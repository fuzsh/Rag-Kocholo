        "text": "Without a dog in the fight in this year’s NBA Finals, a name from the past has resurfaced to create a sense of nostalgia for longtime fans of the New Jersey Nets. Given the type of star power already on display, Richard Jefferson’s unlikely emergence as a key player for the Cleveland Cavaliers has been a fun trip down memory lane.\n\nWhich begs the question: Is Jefferson worthy of having his number retired by the Nets organization after his playing career comes to an end? His resume on the surface may not seem to warrant such an honor, but when you dig a little deeper, the case can be made for the number “24” to hang in the Barclays Center rafters one day.\n\nNew Jersey’s transformation from cellar dwellers to league contenders would never have happened if it weren’t for the arrival of Jason Kidd, but the draft night deal that sent Seton Hall’s Eddie Griffin to Houston for Jefferson, Jason Collins, and Brandon Armstrong played a big role in the Nets’ ascension. A culture of winning and competitiveness soon solidified, and Jefferson factored in enormously.\n\nWith Jefferson as an integral part of that core, the Nets went on to experience the best years while playing in New Jersey. Six consecutive postseason appearances were highlighted by back-to-back trips to the NBA Finals and four Atlantic Division championships. Although the Nets never won an NBA title, there’s no taking away the amount of success the organization accomplished.\n\nThe 6’7″ small forward averaged a respectable 17.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.0 assists over 489 regular season games (417 as a starter) during his Nets career, and that steady production carried into the postseason as he averaged 15.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.5 assists in 78 playoff games (55 of which he started). For the cynics who may diminish that stat-line, it’s important to remember those Nets teams were never about one player putting up gaudy statistics. That was what made them such a unique team that played an unselfish brand of basketball.\n\nNets fans will never forget the magical run of the early 2000’s, and aside from Jason Kidd, RJ was the one other constant of the “Big Three.” (Kenyon Martin and Vince Carter were only there for parts of the Nets’ run.) For a franchise that has experienced mostly losing throughout their NBA existence, this period of time provided mostly fond memories fans can cherish.\n\nNow with Jefferson nearing the end of his career, 15 years after being drafted out of the University of Arizona, the Nets organization should honor their past and memorialize this key member of their glory years.\n\nTo hear more from Jonathan Griggs about the Nets, follow him on Twitter @WeMustBeNets."
