He won an NBA title with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016.\n\nJefferson was part of the 2001 Wildcats squad that fell to Duke in the national title game. It was Arizona's last Final Four appearance.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Jefferson attended Phoenix's Moon Valley High School.\n\nHe donated $3.5 million to the UA in 2007, earmarked toward the building that became Richard Jefferson Gymnasium, which was dedicated in 2008 and serves as the basketball team's practice facility."
