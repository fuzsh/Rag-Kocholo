        "text": "I went to see my first professional basketball game when I was a teenager. It was circa 2005 and my interest in the NBA had been electrified by LeBron James. Here was a young man, just a half-decade older than I was, exerting his will against an entire league of professional athletes. I was hooked.\n\nThe entire reason that I got those tickets was to watch LeBron play. Against the Nets. In their East Rutherford arena. Which was fifteen minutes from my house.\n\nThe Nets beat the Cavaliers that night, to what felt like a crowd of mostly empty seats. I remember feeling a pang of guilt in witnessing the abysmal level of support for my local team and knowing that I was part of the problem.\n\nSpurred by cognitive dissonance, I must have prayed for a hybrid universe in which I could root for both a New Jersey squad and for LeBron James.\n\nIn incremental steps, it happened.\n\nOver time, the Cavaliers became increasingly imbued with the Garden State’s hoop dreams. There were so many New Jersey-related subplots playing out on the court during Game 7 of the Finals that the Cavs’ ultimate victory was arguably the single greatest moment in the state’s pro basketball history.\n\nJust look at Cleveland’s most Garden State-centric lineup. In the Cavs’ four victories over the Warriors, the team had a real plus-minus of +42 when LeBron James and Tristan Thompson manned the floor with Jersey-raised Kyrie Irving, native son J.R. Smith, and adopted son/basketball android Richard Jefferson. That’s the highest RPM of any lineup on either team across the Cavs’ four wins. For context, the second-highest RPM for either team during that span was +25, put up by Cleveland’s starting five.\n\nSparked by the successes of this versatile, seemingly just-discovered lineup, the Cleveland Cavaliers evolved into a dark-matter, inverse-property replicant of the Golden State Warriors and won games 3, 5, 6, and 7. They defended the pick-and-roll, switched with confidence, and threw up spirit-crushing daggers. By all measures of the basketball universe, LeBron and his Cavs were rolling. Something magical came together for the Cleveland squad and it should have New Jersey basketball fans reeling with pride.\n\nIt’s time to unpack the mosaic of the Cavalier’s recent heroics with a look at the hoop union between America’s Sixth City and its Third State. Let us recognize the Garden State greatness that is Kyrie Irving, Richard Jefferson, and J.R. Smith.\n\nWe all know that Kyrie Irving is the best basketball product to come out of New Jersey since Shaquille O’Neal. If you’re from New Jersey, you have to love Kyrie. He’s our hometown kid, his upside is still relatively unknown, and we’re getting glimpses into the fact that he could become a straight up legend. Any addition to his resume is a further elevation of his basketball glory. Every time he ascends that mountain, he takes a piece of New Jersey with him.\n\nAnd it’s possible that he could hit some very high altitudes.\n\nKyrie’s game is otherworldly. He’s like a light-footed dancer who learned deity-summoning rituals from ancient scriptures and just happens to perform the necessary footwork while dribbling a basketball. That is the best explanation I can muster to make sense of his immaculate dribble and shoot combos. Once summoned, the divine entities to whom Kyrie has pledged take over his shooting motion and deliver the ball into the center of the hoop. Witness the spiritual performance on display in Kyrie’s Finals-clinching shot and try to catch the moment when his body is turned over to other powers. Insane.\n\nSince being drafted number one overall in 2011, the West Orange product has put New Jersey back on the basketball map. Kyrie has publicly renounced New York City and has instead shared his spotlight with local gems. Clarks Pond, in Bloomfield, where Kyrie filmed his first Uncle Drew commercial, is a local park. It’s one of several lighted courts in the area. I’ve played there.\n\nAs an aside, I was visiting a friend in North Carolina last summer when I almost drove 2 hours to Wilmington, just to see Michael Jordan’s childhood home. I didn’t end up making the drive, but I seriously considered it. That’s what happens when you own a slice of basketball glory. Clarks Pond could become a tourist stop for future NBA nerds.\n\nKyrie’s Finals heroics cemented our ideas about where his career is headed. While he shined as LeBron’s Robin, he still out-Curried Curry on basketball’s biggest stage. And he’s only 24 years old. When he hits his prime, he will be a contender for multiple league MVP awards. If anyone still needs a superstar to get behind, Kyrie is your guy. His bandwagon shamelessly accepts all New Jersey residents and the seats still smell like champagne.\n\nYet, Kyrie is only one piece of this puzzle. What would ultimately become the Cavs’ NJ-centric quest really began in the 2001–2002 and 2002–2003 seasons, when Richard Jefferson received his mission and awakened all of New Jerseyans’ hopes that they could partake in the glory of an NBA Finals victory.\n\nDuring each of Richard Jefferson’s first two seasons as a New Jersey Net, he got a taste of the Finals without ever winning the chip — once as a sixth man, the other as the third option behind Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin. Being so close so early must have imparted upon RJ the looming sense of a personal Moirai holding up two destinies. He was either going to win it all or forever hoist the banner of 2nd place finishes.\n\nOver subsequent seasons and through further heartbreak, RJ became the perfect mercenary while on one of the league’s most mercenary teams. The New Jersey Nets, a team without a community, boasted a persona that had little to do with their locale and an arena that was guarded by an onslaught of intersecting highways. They often felt like a franchise that was here on commission, only to return to the furnace of some CEO’s generic-brand generator after their contract expired.\n\nYoung Richard Jefferson, an athletic freak, was the perfect fit for an odd franchise. Slashing to the rim, muscular and hairless like an alien prototype war machine, RJ always had the aura of a gun-for-hire. More than a product of player development, he was like a weapon constructed in an underground training facility somewhere below the New Jersey Turnpike.\n\nIn 2008, Jefferson was traded to the Bucks and Nets fans demanded that the world avert its stare from their suffering. Yet, with that trade, the subject of New Jersey’s own experimental project was released into the NBA landscape, thus expanding the parameters for his ultimate success. Just as Logan carried around totemic representations of the Weapon X facility within himself, RJ had a mission that was welded in the swamps of the meadowlands; he bore the weight of that small piece of New Jersey until he was able to make good on his destiny.\n\nWhen the Nets moved to Brooklyn in 2012, New Jersey’s championship destiny was officially relieved of specific ties to any one franchise. New Jersey’ basketball win shares scattered in the wind and were reunited with their legitimate heirs. Richard Jefferson, once a flag bearer for our hoop dreams, resumed his mantle yet again.\n\nWhen RJ finally won the championship in June, he satisfied the mission that had been crafted in front of his earliest fans. It was so overwhelming that Richard Jefferson retired and unretired in a matter of days.\n\nEven I, who had rooted against his Nets that one evening in East Rutherford, reverently looked up to RJ as one of our most seasoned basketball ambassadors. Like J-Kidd winning the title with the Mavs in 2011, RJ’s victory gave further validation to those early 2000’s Nets team.\n\nThis Cavs’ vindication of New Jersey basketball was in the works all season. When the team signed Richard Jefferson last summer, they created a direct link from the present to NJ’s basketball past. Standing in the center of that link was Millstone Township’s own J.R. Smith. Listen to J.R.’s inner fanboy take over during last year’s training camp:\n\nJ.R. was in high school when Richard Jefferson was playing in the Finals. To now be on the same team as his former NJ hero must have materialized J.R.’s adolescent pro-hoop reveries. J.R.’s excitement was palpable, particularly as he reminisced to Kyrie Irving about the days when RJ’s, J-Kidd’s, and K-Mart’s jerseys were everywhere. (If Kyrie’s response seemed a little flat, that’s because it probably was. When the Nets faced off against the Lakers in the 2002 Finals, Kyrie was ten years old. I’m sure that Kyrie has his own fond memories of those Nets squads, but unless his elementary school was popping with NBA youth-sized apparel collectors, I doubt he remembers those ubiquitous Nets jerseys quite like J.R. does.)\n\nThat moment in training camp was representative of how I felt rooting for the Cavs all the way from New Jersey. Shout out to J.R. Smith, New Jersey’s cultural emissary, our face in the NBA world. J.R.’s excitement in training camp was merely a harbinger of what was to come when the Cavs actually took home the Larry O’Brien trophy in June.\n\nNow, the New Jersey native has just won the NBA Finals playing alongside both a New Jersey basketball hero and New Jersey’s finest basketball product. It’s possible that the deity Kyrie summoned with his footwork in the final minute of Game 7 was actually J.R.’s Final Form, or that the fulfillment of so many hoop fantasies at once spurred his transformation, but either way, J.R. turned into Party God, a shirtless force of nature so powerful that he commanded the attention of the sitting President of the United States and was automatically entered into the race to pick his successor. This is where J.R. Smith was always meant to be.\n\nThere were signs of this destiny. J.R. Smith plays basketball like he is lucid dreaming. If I were dreaming about playing basketball, I would only know how to play like J.R. Smith: catch the ball anywhere on the court, shoot, celebrate, get a handshake from someone I worshipped as a kid. It’s only fitting that someone who plays basketball in another realm would forever exist in that sphere following his ascension to basketball glory.\n\nJ.R. Smith is no longer human. That is perhaps the best thing to come from an NBA Finals that has already gifted us the awakening of Kyrie Irving, future Hall of Famer, and the career achievement of Richard Jefferson. It took the Cavs’ winning and of course it took LeBron James, but it also took some home state mana for J.R. to reach this point.\n\nOnce they process the gravitas of our recent victory, everyone in the Garden State should rejoice that we have a veritable reason to root for pro basketball again. New Jersey has a team and it’s the Cleveland Cavaliers. All hail our champions."
