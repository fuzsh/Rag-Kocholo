        "text": "The Nuggets are close to signing veteran forward Richard Jefferson to a one-year contract, league sources confirmed to The Denver Post on Monday night.\n\nThe deal will pay Jefferson $2.3 million, according to sources. The Nuggets are likely to waive veteran point guard Jameer Nelson to make room for Jefferson on the 15-man roster, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nJefferson was traded from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Atlanta Hawks over the weekend, then was waived by the Hawks. He became an unrestricted free agent Monday afternoon.\n\nJefferson, 37, has enjoyed a lengthy NBA career with seven franchises. He averaged 5.7 points and 2.6 rebounds per game for the Cavaliers last season while shooting 44.6 percent from the floor and 33.3 percent from 3-point range. He won a championship with the Cavaliers in 2016 and also played for the Dallas Mavericks, Utah Jazz, Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs, Milwaukee Bucks and New Jersey Nets.\n\nKnown around the league for his engaging personality, Jefferson adds another veteran presence to a young Nuggets team aiming for its first playoff berth since 2013. Denver is also a sensible destination for Jefferson because of his friendship with Nuggets president and governor Josh Kroenke. Jefferson joins a forward group that will start Paul Millsap and Wilson Chandler and features backups Trey Lyles, Kenneth Faried, Juancho Hernangomez and Tyler Lydon.\n\nThis move also partially clears up Denver’s point guard battle. Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Monday that the starting competition had been narrowed to youngsters Jamal Murray and Emmanuel Mudiay. Nelson, who was Denver’s starter down the stretch last season, missed a chunk of training camp with a toe injury and started one preseason game.\n\nThe Nuggets open their 2017-18 season Wednesday at Utah."
