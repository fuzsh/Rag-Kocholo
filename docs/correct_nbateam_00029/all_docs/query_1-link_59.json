        "text": "He may no longer be a Cavalier, but Richard Jefferson is beloved by many Cavs fans.\n\nThe fan-favorite veteran announced his retirement from basketball Saturday night on Instagram. He posted a video of his late father who he called Big Rich. The post was in part a tribute to Big Rich who died last month in a drive-by shooting.\n\nJefferson played 17 seasons in the NBA. He was drafted 13th overall in the 2001 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets before being traded to the New Jersey Nets, where he played from 2001-2009. He suited up in Cavs uniform from 2015-2017 and was a part of the 2016 championship team. Jefferson also made stops in Milwaukee, San Antonio, Golden State, Utah, Dallas and Denver throughout his career.\n\nHere is Richard Jefferson's Instagram post (@RichardAJefferson):\n\nWell here‚Äôs my first post! In the last month I‚Äôve dealt with two life changing events back to back. My decision to move on from basketball and the tragic passing of Big Rich. The support of my family and friends have been huge. This video was taken after he bbq‚Äôd for about 20 people, something he would do a few times every summer. All I would do is tell people that I was having people over to my house and the next question was ‚ÄúIs Big Rich on the grill?‚Äù He really was a true OG. I‚Äôm going to miss all his one-liners, his cooking and his ability to make a whole room laugh. Until next time!!!! #RIPPLAYAPLAYA #tripleOG PAPA REALLY WAS A ROLLING STONE!!! üòÇüòÇ‚úäüèΩ"
