        "text": "Last week, Andrew Marchand of the Post reported that several TV outlets were interested in hiring Richard Jefferson as a game analysts, listing YES, ESPN and the Clippers as the top three.\n\nNow, league sources tell NetsDaily that unless RJ gets an offer to play another year, he will be joining the YES Network, doing both game analysis and studio work on broadcasts of Nets games.\n\nThe move to the broadcast booth comes a decade after he was traded to the Bucks for Yi Jianlian. Jefferson, 38, has since played with the Spurs, Warriors, Jazz, Mavericks, Cavaliers and Nuggets, winning an NBA championship with Cleveland two years ago. He joined the Cavs broadcast teams in the playoffs last season, his first broadcasting gig.\n\nJefferson will join a YES team headlined by Ian Eagle and includes Sarah Kustok, Ryan Ruocco, Jim Spanarkel and Michael Grady as well as studio hosts Chris Shearn, Bob Lorenz and Nancy Newman. Mike Fratello will not be returning.\n\nKustok, who’s become a rising star in sports announcing on YES as well as FOX Sports, will continue as lead analyst.\n\nIn talking to Marchand last week, Jefferson said “I’m a basketball player until I am not a basketball player, My goal is to play basketball this season.” But NBA training camps open next week and it’s unlikely Jefferson will be suiting up with any team.\n\nJefferson played seven years with the Nets, including the two Finals teams in 2002 and 2003. He averaged 17.4 points and 5.4 rebounds over the course of his career. His best season was 2007-08, his final year in New Jersey, putting up 22.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists."
