Yet another New Jersey Nets legend hangs it up as Richard Jefferson is officially walking away from the game of basketball.

The list of active players to play for the New Jersey Nets is reduced by one. Richard Jefferson announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt Instagram post. Jefferson also discussed the recent loss of his father as he deals with these life-changing moments.

Jefferson is retiring after 17 successful seasons. He won a championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016 and advanced to the NBA Finals with the Nets during his first two seasons in the league.

The Nets teams that advanced to back-to-back NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003 were two of the best teams in franchise history. Jefferson has since become a wise veteran, but on those Nets teams, he was the precocious young stud.

Jefferson had his best years with the Nets. He spent seven seasons in New Jersey, averaging 17.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game. He made the NBA All-Rookie second team in 2002.

Not only did Jefferson play his best basketball with the Nets, but it’s also where he played for the longest. He played for eight different teams, but he’s never spent more than three seasons with any team other than the Nets.
