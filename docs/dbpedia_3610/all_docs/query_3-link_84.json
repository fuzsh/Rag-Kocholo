        "text": "Tenant Information\n\nClick a topic, or press the enter key on a topic, to reveal its answer.\n\nLead Poisoning and Lead-Based Paint Safety\n\nAlthough paint is the most common source of lead poisoning, you can learn more about other types of lead exposure and lead poisoning.\n\nYou can also be proactive to keep your child safe from lead-based paint. In any building built before January 1, 1960, if there is a child under the age of six residing in the apartment, tenants should:\n\nWash floors, windowsills, hands, toys, and pacifiers often\n\nReport any peeling paint to your landlord so that the surface can be repaired immediately anytime you see peeling paint throughout the year\n\nIf dust is being created during construction work, ensure your child is not in the work area and ensure that the workers are keeping that area separated from the rest of your apartment. Report dust created by this type of work that is not contained and/or is not cleaned daily to 311.\n\nRemind your doctor to test your child for lead poisoning at ages one and two\n\nThe Annual Notice\n\nBetween January 1st and January 16th, you should receive an Annual Notice from your landlord asking if you have a child under six routinely spending 10 or more hours a week in your apartment. You must return this notice to your landlord by February 15th, indicating if you have a child under six residing in your apartment, and that you require an annual inspection of painted surfaces in your apartment. If you do not have a child under six residing in your apartment, you are still obligated to return the form to your landlord by February 15th with an indication that no child under six resides in your apartment.\n\nIf a child younger than six comes to live in the apartment or routinely spends more than 10 hours per week any other time during the year, you must also notify the landlord in writing.\n\nAnnual Notice for Prevention of Lead-Based Paint Hazards - Inquiry Regarding Child (Aviso Anual Para Medidas de Precaucion con los Peligros de Plomo en la Pintura-Encusta Respecto al Nino)\n\nThe Lease Notice\n\nWhen you are signing a lease, property owners are required to provide:\n\nThe Lease/Commencement of Occupancy Notice for Prevention of Lead-Based Paint Hazards (Spanish | Español)) to new tenants as a form of inquiry if a child under the age of six will live or regularly spending 10 hours or more per week in the unit\n\nThe Lead Paint Hazards in the Home (Spanish | Español) pamphlet.\n\nProperty owners must also certify on this notice that they have performed the required turnover work prior to occupancy of the unit by the new occupants. This notice is also required at lease renewal. Tenants may request a copy of the documentation to show the required work was completed.\n\nComplaints\n\nWhen a tenant files a complaint with HPD about any condition which may cause peeling paint and a child under the age of six resides in the apartment in a building built prior to 1960, HPD will attempt to schedule an appointment for an inspector to conduct a lead-based paint inspection. A lead-based paint inspection requires the inspector to look in every room for any paint that is peeling or otherwise coming loose from the surface on ceilings, walls, doors, windows, and other painted surfaces. The inspector will test peeling paint using an x-ray fluorescence machine (XRF), which measures the lead content in the paint. Paint that is not peeling will not be tested. If lead-based paint is found on these peeling paint surfaces and the tenant has not already had their child’s blood lead level tested or spoken with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) about having a blood test, the tenant should call 311 to find out more about this testing. A health care provider or the DOHMH can recommend the next steps if it is determined that a child has an elevated blood lead level.\n\nIf the tenant does not indicate there is a child under the age of six residing in the apartment when the complaint is filed, but the inspector confirms there is a child under the age of six residing in the apartment at the time of the inspection, the inspector will conduct a visual paint survey for paint that is peeling without the XRF machine. If peeling paint is found, another inspector may return to the apartment within the following two weeks to conduct a second inspection that includes the XRF machine to determine if the paint meets the definition of lead-based paint. If this follow-up inspection cannot be performed, a violation will be issued based on the previous visual survey as a presumed lead-based paint hazard.\n\nHPD sends tenants a letter with the results of the XRF testing performed during the inspection.\n\nRepairs\n\nAs a result of the annual notice or anytime a tenant in an apartment where a child under six spends 10 or more hours a week in an apartment (“resides”) reports a peeling paint condition or HPD issues a violation, a landlord is responsible to properly repair the condition using certified contractors and safe work practices. If the landlord does not fix peeling paint or if the work is not being done safely (if the work is creating dust that is not contained), the tenant should call 311.\n\nIf HPD issues a violation and the landlord does not complete the repair, HPD will send a qualified inspector to see what needs to be done, hire a certified contractor to make the repair, and follow up the repair with an inspection to collect dust samples to ensure that no lead dust remains after the work is completed. All these steps are necessary to protect your child.\n\nLocal Law 1 of 2004 requires that owners follow and retain evidence that safe work practices were used for all repair work in a dwelling unit or building common area where a child under the age of six resides when more than two square feet of lead-based paint or paint of an unknown lead content is disturbed.\n\nHPD has created a form to help an owner know when the Local Law 1 requirement for documenting safe work practices applies: see the Sample Form for Safe Work Practices Compliance and a Frequently Asked Questions document related to Safe Work Practices.\n\nOwner Responsibilities\n\nClick a topic, or press the enter key on a topic, to reveal its answer.\n\nOwner Responsibilities\n\nIf there is lead-based paint or the paint has not been tested for an apartment or common area in a building built prior to 1960, the property owner must:\n\nMonitor painted surfaces and repair the paint properly if it is peeling in apartments with children under six or in common areas of the building.\n\nThis monitoring includes an annual process of annual notices and investigations (see details in the Annual Notice section).\n\nRepairs must be done following federal and city regulations, including hiring certified firms/workers who follow prescribed safe work practices. These requirements differ depending on whether general repair work is being done, the work is being done specifically to remove lead-based paint or the work is being done pursuant to violations issued by either HPD or the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).\n\nRemove lead-based paint from doors and windows (as well as make other repairs as described below) when apartments become vacant.\n\nTest all painted surfaces by 2025 so that they know where the lead-based paint is.\n\nMaintain records related to all of the above activities for at least 10 years.\n\nPenalties may be significant for failing to conduct any of the above activities or keeping records about that compliance. The owner’s section below provides more detail about how to comply with these requirements.\n\nHPD's Lead-Based Paint Briefings (sent out periodically to property owners who have included an email on their HPD Property Registration) and the “Get Ahead of Lead” webinar series (which you will also receive notification about via email or which you can access below under Webinars) can help you learn more about your responsibilities and obligations under New York City’s Laws and Rules (Local Law 1 of 2004 and amendments).\n\nOwner Recordkeeping Responsibilities\n\nAll of the activities described on this webpage require documentation of compliance. In order to assist owners, HPD has created a series of sample compliance documents that you can use as is or which can assist you in designing your own recordkeeping documentation. In the event that your property is audited, and whenever you sell your property, you will be required to provide this documentation:\n\nSample Forms for Delivery of Annual Notice Compliance\n\nSample Forms for Annual Investigation Compliance\n\nSample Forms for Turnover Vacancy Compliance\n\nSample Form for Safe Work Practices Compliance\n\nSample Affidavit by Certified Individual Who Performed Lead-Based Paint Testing\n\nSample Affidavit by Dust Wipe Sampler\n\nCondo/Coop Buildings\n\nIf a condo or coop dwelling unit is occupied by the owner or the owner’s family, not a tenant, most of Local Law 1 of 2004, including the requirements for the Annual Notice and annual inspection, do not apply. However, if a dwelling unit is occupied by a tenant rather than the unit owner, the Annual Notice requirements of Local Law 1 apply, and, if a child under six is determined to reside in the dwelling unit, Local Law 1 requires an annual inspection be performed for common areas and the dwelling unit. Owners who are leasing out their unit should discuss these requirements with their cooperative or condo board and management company to determine the process for the Annual Notice, inspection, and any repair work that might be necessary. Any repair work must be performed by certified workers using safe work practices pursuant to Local Law 1 of 2004. Owners and management should document all communications and must retain all records of the inspections and any remediation performed for at least 10 years.\n\nThe Lease Notice\n\nWhen providing a lease, property owners are required to provide:\n\nThe Lease/Commencement of Occupancy Notice for Prevention of Lead-Based Paint Hazards (Spanish | Español)) to new tenants as a form of inquiry if a child under the age of six will live or regularly spending 10 hours or more per week in the unit\n\nThe Lead Paint Hazards in the Home (Spanish | Español) pamphlet.\n\nProperty owners must also certify on this notice that they have performed the required turnover work (see below section on Turnover) prior to occupancy of the unit by the new occupants. This notice is also required at lease renewal. Tenants may request a copy of the documentation to show the required work was completed.\n\nAnnual Requirements\n\nProperty owners must complete the following tasks and document that they have done so (see Sample Compliance Forms section for assistance on documentation) every year:\n\nSend out the Annual Notice to determine if there is a child under six routinely spending 10 or more hours each week (“residing”) in a dwelling unit. Between January 1st and January 16th, owners of multiple dwelling built before 1960 (or between 1960 and 1978 if the owner has knowledge there is lead-based paint) are required to deliver an Annual Notice to each tenant and to collect the completed notice from the tenant by February 15th.\n\nThere are two versions of the Annual Notice that owners can use:\n\nThe Annual Notice asks the tenant to disclose if a child under the age of six resides in the dwelling unit. \"Resides\" is to routinely spend 10 or more hours per week in a dwelling unit, which includes both a child who lives in the apartment and a child who just visits for this period of time. There are two versions of the Annual Notice that owners can use:\n\nProtect Your Child from Lead Poisoning and Window Falls Annual Notice (Proteja a su Nino del Envenenamiento por Plomo y de las Caidas por las Ventanas Notificación Anual\n\nAnnual Notice for Prevention of Lead-Based Paint Hazards - Inquiry Regarding Child (Aviso Anual Para Medidas de Precaucion con los Peligros de Plomo en la Pintura-Encusta Respecto al Nino)\n\nThe notice must be provided to the tenant in at least English and Spanish and in duplicate (two copies of each) so the tenant can retain a copy and return a copy to the owner. Make sure your tenants know where to return this notice.\n\nKeep evidence that this notice was delivered and retain the completed notice received back from the tenant. This notice is important because it determines whether the owner must do other required activities, such as the annual investigation and whether safe work practices are required.\n\nIf the tenant does not return the completed notice by February 15th, the owner must conduct follow-up inspections between February 16th and March 1st to attempt to determine if a child under six lives or routinely spends more than 10 hours in the dwelling unit. An owner must keep records of the attempts made to contact the tenant to perform the investigation.\n\nIf the owner does not receive the completed notice from the tenant and cannot determine based on these follow-up investigations whether there is a child under six, the owner must also notify DOHMH in writing that no notice has been received back from the tenant (a copy of this notification should also be maintained by the owner). The owner’s notification to DOHMH should be mailed to:\n\nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene — Healthy Homes\n\n125 Worth Street, Sixth Floor, CN58\n\nNew York, NY 10013\n\nHPD has created forms to assist an owner with documenting the notice was sent, received back, or any follow-up inspections done if the notice was not returned by the tenant: see the Sample Forms for Delivery of Annual Notice Compliance.\n\nConduct the annual investigation\n\nOnce the owner knows which unit has a child under the age of six residing in the unit, the owner must perform a visual investigation to look for potential lead-based paint hazards. This investigation must be conducted at least annually or more often if the owner knows about a condition that may cause a lead hazard, or if the occupant makes a complaint about such a condition.\n\nYou do not need to hire a professional to conduct your annual visual investigation. However, HPD highly recommends that whoever conducts this investigation take the online visual assessment training offered by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to help the person know what to look for. This investigation is a visual inspection looking for peeling paint, chewable surfaces (such as windowsills), deteriorated subsurfaces, friction surfaces (painted doors or windows) and impact surfaces. It must include every surface in every room in the dwelling unit, including the interiors of closets and cabinets. The person conducting the investigation should keep records about what they saw and HPD has created sample forms to assist with this. See the Sample Forms for Annual Investigation Compliance\n\nAfter the visual inspection is completed, the owner is required to give a copy of the inspection results to the tenant.\n\nThe owner must also do this visual inspection in any building common areas (such as a lobby, hallway, or stairwell) of the building where a child resides.\n\nRepair any deteriorated paint promptly using the appropriately certified contractor.\n\nIf there is peeling paint found on a surface where the owner has no documentation of whether there is lead-based paint on the surface, the owner must presume that there is lead-based paint and hire the appropriately certified contractor to complete the repairs safely and quickly or, (if the owner believes there is less than 0.5 mg/cm2 in the paint because the wall is a new wall, for example) to test the peeling paint and keep documented evidence that the paint lead content is less than 0.5 mg/cm2.\n\nTo understand the qualifications that your contractor must have in order to perform the work that is needed, review the and watch the Webinar on Safe Work Practices in NYC: Knowing When and How to Use Certified Contractors when Working with Lead-Based Paint.\n\nAll documents regarding any work done by the appropriate contractors must be maintained. See below for more information about safe work practices.\n\nOwners are required to follow safe work practices and retain evidence that safe work practices were used for all repair work in a dwelling unit or building common area where a child under the age of six resides when more than two square feet of lead-based paint or paint of an unknown lead content is disturbed. There are also circumstances where more than the basic safe work practices are required.\n\nRequirements Upon Turnover of an Apartment\n\nWhen a dwelling unit changes tenants, owners are required to complete lead-based paint activities focused on making the unit safe for a new tenant and before the new tenant takes occupancy (regardless of whether the new tenant has a child at the time of initial occupancy). This is referred to as “turnover.”\n\nOwners must:\n\nRemediate all peeling paint and any underlying defects (such as leaks). At a minimum this would mean wet scrape and painting the surfaces\n\nRemove lead-based paint on chewable surfaces that have evidence of teeth marks or encapsulate the surface with a hard, puncture resistant encapsulant (encapsulants must be approved for this purpose and applied by certified contractors).\n\nRemove lead-based paint from friction surfaces on all doors and door frames. This can result in replacement of the door and door frame.\n\nMake all bare floors, window sills, and window wells in the dwelling unit smooth and cleanable.\n\nAll the work must be done following the safe work practices described above. Owners must then certify compliance with the turnover requirements on the Lease/Commencement of Occupancy Notice for Prevention of Lead-Based Paint Hazards (Contrato/Comeinze de Ocupacion y Medidas de Precaucion con los Peligros en la Pintura-Encuesta Respecto al Nino) provided to the new tenant with the lease (and at lease renewal) and provide documentation to the new tenant upon request along with a copy of the Lead Paint Hazards in the Home (Peligros de la Pintura con Plomo en el Hogar) pamphlet.\n\nRecords of turnover inspections and work must be maintained for 10 years. HPD has created sample forms for an owner to document the turnover inspection was completed: see the Sample Forms for Turnover Vacancy Compliance\n\nFor more information about property owner responsibilities and requirements upon unit turnover, see our FAQ.\n\nPaint Testing Requirement\n\nBy August 9, 2025, or, for an apartment, within one year if a child under the age of six comes to routinely spend 10 or more hours a week in the unit (whichever is sooner), a property owner must use an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified inspector or risk assessor, independent of the owner or any firm hired to perform lead-based paint remediation, to test for the presence of lead-based paint in a dwelling unit or common area of a building built prior to 1960. This requirement must also be met if the rental building was built between 1960 and 1978 and the owner has actual knowledge of lead-based paint. Records of XRF testing must be maintained for 10 years. HPD has created sample forms for an owner to document that the testing was properly completed: see the Sample Affidavit by Certified Individual Who Performed Lead-Based Paint Testing\n\nExisting exemptions will remain active for a unit until such time as the unit is vacated by a tenant (turnover). Note: A lease renewal is not the same thing as turnover, does not need to be reported to HPD, and does not affect the existing exemption.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFederal regulations for lead-based paint also apply in New York City, and owners should be aware that those requirements for safe work practices extend to housing built before January 1, 1978.\n\nThe owner must use contractors certified in abatement by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the level of certification increases if the work being done is over 100 square feet, or requires the removal of two or more painted windows, is in response to a violation, or is specifically for abatement. See the EPA's Locate Certified Inspection, Risk, Assessment, and Abatement Firms webpage.\n\nFor work that does not meet these elevated requirements, the owner must hire a firm that is certified to do renovations (known as Renovation, Repair and Painting or RRP) by the EPA. The EPA website has information about the Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) program. After the work in completed, an EPA-certified lead inspector or risk assessor must take dust samples to confirm the area is free of lead-contaminated dust, below the levels provided in Local Law 1 and HPD’s rules. Owners must retain copies of the firm and worker certificates for the work and the dust samples, the results of the dust samples, and any invoices or documentation of the work done.\n\nThe RRP certification requirement extends to plumbers, electricians, carpentry, etc., if there is any work being done where paint would be disturbed.\n\nYou can find more details about safe work practices in the Guide to Local Law 1 of 2004 Work Practices . Failure to follow safe work practice can result in violations being issued by the Department of Buildings (DOB) or DOHMH\n\nHPD has created a form to help an owner know when the Local Law 1 requirement for documenting safe work practices applies: see the Sample Form for Safe Work Practices Compliance and a Frequently Asked Questions document related to Safe Work Practices.\n\nExemption\n\nAs mentioned above in the section on the Testing Requirement, all units and public areas are REQUIRED under the law to be tested by August 2025. If this testing determines that an apartment or a common area are free from lead-based paint OR if there is lead-based paint and the owner chose to permanently remove or encapsulate that paint (not all surfaces may be encapsulated), the owner may wish to file for an exemption with HPD. Exemptions will only be granted for units tested by an XRF machine with an approved Performance Characteristic Sheet (PCS) issued at an action level of 0.5 mg/cm².\n\nWhat is an Exemption?\n\nA Lead Exemption is a waiver granted by HPD from the presumption of lead-based paint when property owners use safe work practices to remove or permanently cover all lead-based paint or when there is already no paint that tests positive for lead.\n\nWhy file for a lead-based paint exemption?\n\nPaint in buildings built prior to 1960 is presumed under New York City law to be lead-based paint until the lead content in the paint is tested and determined to not meet the legal definition of lead-based paint. The presumption of lead paint places a significant number of requirements on property owners for the maintenance and remediation of painted surfaces, with additional requirements if a child under six routinely spends 10 or more hours a week in the apartment where the paint exists. Once an exemption is granted, for a unit or common area covered by an exemption, the landlord will no longer be required to:\n\nProvide annual notices regarding lead-based paint to the tenant of that unit or conduct annual inspections of units with children under six.\n\nIf the exemption is a Lead-Free exemption – meaning that all paint with lead content of greater than 0.5 mg/cm2 has been permanently removed (not covered) - safe work practices are not required for construction in the covered area.\n\nFor Lead Safe exemptions, the owner will still have to conduct periodic inspections to ensure that any encapsulated lead-based paint remains safely covered.\n\nHow do I file for Lead Exemption?\n\nWe have transitioned to a new exemption application process, which is now available through the Lead Exemption Online Portal (LEOP). This change aims to streamline and simplify the exemption process for owners.\n\nIf you still wish to submit paper applications, you must use our new Application for Exemption. Effective June 1, 2024, the older version of the exemption paper application will no longer be acceptable.\n\nWhat other documents may be required to apply for a Lead Exemption?\n\nAffidavit by Lead Inspection Firm Former Employee\n\nAffidavit of Ownership for Condo/Coop Unit or Unregistered Private Dwelling\n\nAffidavit by Dust Wipe Sampler – Current Employee\n\nAffidavit by Lead Abatement Firm\n\nEncapsulation Affidavit\n\nLead Testing Affidavit – Current Employee\n\nUnits exempt prior to December 1, 2021\n\nBeginning December 1, 2021, the legal standard to define lead-based paint was lowered from 1.0 mg/cm2 to 0.5 mg/cm².\n\nExemptions granted at the 1.0 mg/cm2 remain active until such time as the unit is vacated by a tenant (turnover). Note: A lease renewal is not the same thing as turnover, and does not need to be reported to HPD, and does not affect the existing exemption.\n\nAs of the date of the turnover, the exemption is no longer valid.\n\nOwners must notify the department when turnover occurs for an unit exempted at the 1.0 mg/cm2 standard using the Affidavit of Turnover, which can either be submitted to HPD using the Lead Exemption Online Portal (LEOP) or by mail. The Affidavit of Turnover in an Exempted Unit is also available in the following languages:\n\nArabic | العربية\n\nBengali | বাংলা\n\nChinese (Simplified) | 简化字\n\nFrench | français\n\nHaitian-Creole | Kreyòl ayisyen\n\nKorean | 한국어\n\nPolish | polski\n\nRussian | Русский язык\n\nSpanish | Español\n\nUrdu | اردو\n\nPlease return your completed Affidavit of Turnover in an Exempted Unit to:\n\nNYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development\n\n345 Adams Street 10th Floor\n\nBrooklyn NY 11201\n\nATTN: Lead Exemption Unit\n\nWhen an owner notifies HPD of the turnover or if HPD becomes aware of the turnover, HPD will issue a notice regarding the revocation of the exemption.\n\nAudits of Required Compliance Documents and Audit Recordkeeping Violations Audits\n\nAudits of Required Compliance Documents and Audit Recordkeeping Violations Audits\n\nHPD proactively audits lead-based paint related records to determine a property owner’s compliance with Local Law 1 of 2004, selecting buildings through HPD’s Building Lead Index. HPD also demands these records from owners who have been issued a Commissioner’s Order to Abate (COTA) which DOHMH issues when there is a child with an elevated blood lead level in an apartment where DOHMH has found lead-based paint hazards.\n\nIn both cases, HPD issues a Record Production Order.\n\nThe Record Production Order requires property owners to submit the following documentation for their property within 45 days of the request:\n\nRecords for the Annual Notice distribution and collection\n\nRecords for the completed annual investigations\n\nRecords for work performed to correct open and uncertified lead-based paint hazard violations including documentation of work practices used\n\nRecords for all non-violation work that disturbed lead-based paint or paint of unknown lead content in a dwelling unit where a child under six years of age resides or in the common area of the building, including documentation of the work practices used\n\nRecords for all work performed at turnover of any unit that was the subject of a new tenancy including documentation of work practices used and lead-contaminated dust clearance test results\n\nThe Record Production Order is also issued with a series of affidavits to be completed. A property owner who does not respond to the Record Production Order or who responds with incomplete records will be issued an immediately hazardous Class “C” violation and may be subject to additional violations. Property owners will be liable for a civil penalty of no less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 for this violation. A property owner is also subject to civil penalties specifically for failure to conduct the annual notification and inspection and for failure to perform required activities upon turnover.\n\nAudit Recordkeeping Violations\n\nViolations are also issued if a property owner fails to provide records requested by HPD (audit). These violations include order #s 614, 618, 619, 620, 623, and 626.\n\nIf an owner receives one of these violations, the owner will only be able to comply by providing the required documents. See the tabs for Owner Responsibilities, Annual Requirements, Requirements Upon Turnover of an Apartment, Paint Testing Requirement, Safe Work Practices, Audits of Required Compliance Documents and Audit Recordkeeping Violations Audits (Samples) and the sample Record Production Order on this page for more information about the documents that owners are required to maintain for 10 years.\n\nFor further questions, call the Lead Hotline at 212-863-5501.\n\n618/619/620 Violation Certification Instructions Form\n\n621/622/623/625 Violation Certification and Instructions Form\n\n626 Violation Certification and Instructions Form\n\nHPD can also issue a violation for failure to complete turnover work when conducting a field audit inspection related to a COTA or HPD Lead Index Audit:\n\nOrder #623 is issued when the occupant stated that they moved into the unit within the last ten years and the property owner failed to provide the turnover documents to HPD as requested in our Record Production Order.\n\nRecord Production Order:\n\nRecord Production Order Template (includes Affidavits)\n\nOwners can access below a translated template of the Record Production Order (including affidavits) to assist with understanding the Record Production Order they received in the mail from HPD:\n\nArabic | العربية\n\nBengali | বাংলা\n\nChinese (Simplified) | 简化字\n\nFrench | Français\n\nHaitian-Creole | Kreyòl ayisyen\n\nKorean / 한국어\n\nPolish / polski\n\nRussian | Русский язык\n\nSpanish | Español\n\nUrdu | اردو\n\nLead-Based Paint Hazard Violations\n\nLead-Based Paint Hazard Violations (Violation Order #s 616, 617 and 624)\n\nWhen a tenant files a complaint and a child under the age of six resides in the apartment in a building built prior to 1960, HPD will attempt to schedule an appointment for an inspector to conduct a lead-based paint inspection. A lead-based paint inspection involves testing paint using an x-ray fluorescence machine (XRF), which measures the lead content in the paint. The inspector will test any painted surface that has peeling paint. Violations will be issued if the paint tests positive (greater than or equal to 0.6 mg/cm².) or inconclusive (0.5 mg/cm².).\n\nIf the tenant does not indicate there is a child under the age of six residing in the apartment in the complaint, but the inspector confirms there is a child under the age of six residing in the apartment at the time of inspection, the inspector will conduct a preliminary lead-based paint survey. If peeling paint is found, another inspector will conduct a second inspection to confirm the presence of lead-based paint. If the second inspection cannot be completed, HPD may presume lead-based paint and issue a violation which may be contested by the property owner if testing is done by the property owner.\n\nThese violations are all Class “C” immediately hazardous violations. If the property owner does not properly repair these conditions, using the appropriate licensed contractor, HPD will attempt to remediate the hazard through the Emergency Repair Program (ERP) and will bill the property owner for the work.\n\nCorrection and Certification\n\nProperty owners are required to correct and certify the correction of the violations with HPD within a specified timeframe (indicated on the Notice of Violation) and all work must be performed by an EPA-licensed firm that employs safe work practices. The Guide to Local Law 1 of 2004 (included with the Notice of Violation) and the Safe Work Practices section of this webpage contain more information on the remediation of lead-based paint hazards.\n\nDOHMH prohibits certain companies from performing lead paint testing, lead dust sampling, lead paint and lead dust analysis or lead abatement work. Certifications for corrections of HPD violations will be rejected if one of these companies completes work or testing related to the violations.\n\nOnly an owner, management agent, office of the corporation that owns the property, or party otherwise responsible for the property listed on the property registration may certify the correction of a violation. Once the documents listed below are submitted and accepted as received on time and valid by HPD, a reinspection will be performed before the violation can be cleared.\n\nHow to certify:\n\nComplete the applicable Certification of Correction Form(s) which is on the back of the Notice of Violation.\n\n616/617/624 Violation Certification and Instructions Form\n\n616/617/624 HQS Notice of Failure / Violation Certification and Instructions Form\n\nAttach the following documents:\n\nSworn Statement made by the EPA firm's authorized agent or individual who performed the work to correct the violation(s) stating that the work was performed in accordance with the applicable laws\n\nCopy of the EPA certification for the firm that performed the work to correct the violation(s)\n\nCopy of the lead-contaminated dust clearance tests from a New York State Environmental Laboratory Approval Program certified laboratory\n\nCertificate of Training from the individual who took the surface dust sample\n\nAffidavit from the individual who took the surface dust sample, verifying the date the sample was taken and indicating the address of the apartment where the sample was taken\n\nSubmit the Certification of Correction Form and all attached documents to: HPD Lead-Based Paint Inspection Program 345 Adams Street 10th Floor Brooklyn NY 11201\n\nContestations\n\nContestations will be considered for presumed lead-based paint violations Order #616 and inconclusive violations Order #624.The owner can contest the violation using the Contestation Form only if:\n\nthe building was built in or after 1960\n\nthe paint has been tested and does not contain lead. In this case, documentation regarding the testing must be provided as indicated on the form.\n\nPostponements\n\nAn owner can request up to two postponements of the date of correction if they are having a serious technical difficulty; inability to obtain necessary materials, funds, or labor; or inability to gain access to make the required repair. Review the 1st Request Postponement Form and 2nd Request Postponement Form carefully before submitting the request for postponement. These forms are also included with your Notice of Violation.\n\nOverdue Violations\n\nLead-based paint hazard violations have been issued under several different lead laws over the past 30 years. The laws required different methods of correction and different documentation to support the correction. If the deadline to correct and certify such a violation has passed, the owner cannot certify correction. The next steps that the owner must take will depend on whether an inspection has already been conducted by HPD. For more instructions on how to proceed for your particular building, go to HPDONLINE. Enter your building address, select the Violations tab and then select Overdue Lead-Based Paint Violations. You will be presented with the list of violations that are open and next steps, including information on which of the below affidavits is required to be submitted.\n\nYou may be required to submit documents. Below find the documents that may be required.\n\nAF-5 Affidavit of Compliance: Lead-Based Paint Violations (for work completed after August 1, 2004)\n\nAF-3 Affidavit of Compliance: Lead-Based Paint Violations (for work completed prior to August 1, 2004)\n\nSample Affidavit by Dust Wipe Sampler (for violations, not to be used for the Exemption Application)\n\nSample Sworn Statement for the EPA-licensed lead abatement firm (for violations, not to be used for the Exemption Application)\n\nLead-based Paint Hazards Turnover violations\n\nDuring a lead-based paint inspection where a child under six resides, HPD will also issue violations for a property owner’s failure to conduct turnover work if there are lead-based paint hazard violations issued for door and window friction surfaces. These violations require owners to comply with Turnover requirements, which would have required abatement of these surfaces, and certify correction. During the inspection procedure, HPD would have received information from the occupant that they moved in after August 2, 2004, the effective date of Local Law 1.\n\nThere are four types of Turnover violations. You may certify correction for each by completing the turnover work and providing the appropriate documentation. Please read the instructions carefully that are included with your Notice of Violation as it will provide what is needed to correct these violations. Generally, the owner must provide evidence that all window and door frictions surfaces are free of lead-based paint.\n\nNotice of Violation\n\nThere are three types of violations:You may also contest violations based on the reasons provided with each specific order number ­­­­— the contestation reasons are not the same for each type of violation, so read that document carefully.
