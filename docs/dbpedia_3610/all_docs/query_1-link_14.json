        "text": "Moral reasoning is a key element of the Singapore Ministry of Education's Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, and educators in Singapore are currently encouraged to facilitate growth in students' moral reasoning based on the Stages of Moral Development established by Lawrence Kohlberg. To monitor students' progress in this area, however, a validated test of moral reasoning is needed. A review of existing moral reasoning assessments indicated that none provide a practical means by which large numbers of students in Singapore classrooms can be assessed in this area. In this study, the Moral Reasoning Questionnaire (MRQ) was developed and validated to assess moral reasoning development in Singapore secondary classrooms. The MRQ presents moral dilemmas that integrate prosocial, antisocial , and social pressure elements within situations that would be familiar to Singapore secondary (grades 7-12, aged between 12 and 18) students. Evidence supported the reliability and validity of the MRQ. The MRQ could be applicable as a practical means to assess moral reasoning on a broad-scale basis.\n\nResearch supporting social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools demonstrates numerous benefits for students, including increased academic achievement and social and emotional competencies. However, research supporting the adoption of SEL lacks a clear conception of ethical competence. This lack of clarity is problematic for two reasons. First, it contributes to the conflation of social, emotional, and ethical competencies. Second, as a result, insufficient attention is paid to the related, yet distinct, ends of social-emotional and ethical education. While supporting SEL we critique the assumption of uniformity between social-emotional and ethical literacy and argue for the significance of educational programming to support ethical competencies alongside or within SEL, including educating children to develop an autonomous ethical orientation. Doing so would advance the efforts of educators to provide an education for the whole child.\n\nEndeavours to assess moral reasoning in education have largely been via established but less contemporary measures, with recent measures developed more than a decade ago. Together with the call to go beyond assessing cognitive constructs, and the intended learning outcomes of the Singapore Ministry of Education Character and Citizenship Education curriculum that requires teachers to help students progress in their moral reasoning stages, there is a need for a measure that affords consistency when evaluating students' attainment of learning outcomes stipulated in the curriculum. Guided by Messick's unitary concept of validity, this paper reviewed existing measures of moral reasoning for suitability, and found that established measures presented varying degrees of tenability in assessing moral reasoning. Findings related to content appropriateness and group administrability yielded a paucity of measures applicable for large-scale assessment of moral reasoning in Singapore secondary schools. To address some of these issues, this review suggests the development of a fit-for-purpose measure.\n\nReliable and valid measures of children’s and adolescents’ social emotional competence (SEC) are necessary to develop in order to assess their social emotional development and provide appropriate intervention in child and adolescent development. A pool of 25 items was created for the Social Emotional Competence Questionnaire (SECQ) that represented five dimensions of SEC: self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management and responsible decision-making. A series of four studies are reported relating to the development and validation of the measure. Confirmatory factor analyses of the responses of 444 fourth-graders showed an acceptable fit of the model. The model was replicated with another 356 secondary school students. Additional studies revealed good internal consistency. The significant correlations among the five SEC components and academic performance provided evidence for the predictive validity of the instrument. With multiple samples, these results showed that the scale holds promise as a reliable, valid measure of SEC.\n\nPurpose: The global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic had plagued the world since 2019, resulting in significant impact on many lives around the world. Young children being one of the most vulnerable groups in the global society suffer mental and emotional stress and developmental challenges caused by COVID-19 related stressors. Towards living with COVID-19 as an endemic, there is a greater need to cultivate social-emotional competencies and values that will enable young children to live in a world of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. This paper focuses on the social-emotional and moral development of Singapore children based on the image of the Singapore child conceptualized through a content analysis of the national curriculum frameworks for early childhood which spans from birth to eight years of age. It proposes how public policy can translate into developmentally appropriate practice according to ages and stages of the preschool and lower primary education systems in Singapore. Method: It maps child development theories against pedagogical approaches to design a proposed curriculum model for preschool children from birth to six years of age to promote the transition and continuity of learning and development from early childhood to primary education. Results: The proposed model provides recommendations for cultivating values and social-emotional in young children based on the image of the Singapore child, child development theories and pedagogical approaches. Conclusion: It concludes with identifying the key areas of teacher competencies required to enact such a curriculum as teachers are the direct implementers for curriculum.

The main reason is that during this time adolescents are in their prime developmental stage. They undergo both the moral dilemma of Identity vs. identity confusion and Moral development. The measuring of adolescents posed an ethical debate whether or not adolescents can be questioned in schooling hours and at school who has the responsibility of legal guardianship. All participating candidates were given questionnaires in which section B measured an identity scale and section C measured a moral development stage. These two scores were then correlated using the Pearson’s moment product correlation, an r of 0.84 and a p of 0.037 were found meaning that there is a strong correlation between the two factors and it can be considered to be statistically significant."
