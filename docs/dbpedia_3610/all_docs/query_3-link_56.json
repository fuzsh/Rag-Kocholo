        "text": "It is critical that business owners correctly determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors.\n\nGenerally, you must withhold and deposit income taxes, social security taxes and Medicare taxes from the wages paid to an employee. Additionally, you must also pay the matching employer portion of social security and Medicare taxes as well as pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee. Generally, you do not have to withhold or pay any taxes on payments to independent contractors.\n\nSelect the scenario that applies to you:\n\nI am an independent contractor or in business for myself. If you are a business owner or contractor who provides services to other businesses, then you are generally considered self-employed. For more information on your tax obligations if you are self-employed (an independent contractor), see our self-employed individuals tax center.\n\nI hire or contract with individuals to provide services to my business. If you are a business owner hiring or contracting with other individuals to provide services, then you must determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors. Follow the rest of this page to find out more about this topic and what your responsibilities are.\n\nDetermining whether the individuals providing services are employees or independent contractors\n\nBefore you can determine how to treat payments you make for services, you must first know the business relationship that exists between you and the person performing the services. The person performing the services may be:\n\nAn independent contractor\n\nAn employee (common-law employee)\n\nA statutory employee\n\nA statutory nonemployee\n\nA government worker\n\nIn determining whether the person providing service is an employee or an independent contractor, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and independence must be considered.\n\nCommon law rules\n\nFacts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories:\n\nBehavioral: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?\n\nFinancial: Are the business aspects of the worker’s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)\n\nType of relationship: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (that is, pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship continue and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?\n\nBusinesses must weigh all these factors when determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor. Some factors may indicate that the worker is an employee, while other factors indicate that the worker is an independent contractor. There is no “magic” or set number of factors that “makes” the worker an employee or an independent contractor and no one factor stands alone in making this determination. Also, factors which are relevant in one situation may not be relevant in another.\n\nThe keys are to look at the entire relationship and consider the extent of the right to direct and control the worker. Finally, document each of the factors used in coming up with the determination.\n\nRemote worker\n\nAn individual working remotely, for example, performing services for you from a location other than an office operated by you, is your employee under the common-law rules, if you can control what will be done and how it will be done. This is so even if the worker can choose to work remotely. What matters is that you have the right to control the details of how the services are performed.\n\nIf the remote worker is a U.S. citizen or resident alien employed outside the United States by an American employer review the following pages for additional information.\n\nFederal income tax withholding for persons employed abroad by a U.S. person\n\nSocial Security and Medicare tax for U.S. citizens and resident aliens employed abroad by American employer\n\nU.S. citizens and resident aliens employed abroad - FUTA\n\nForm SS-8\n\nIf it is still unclear whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor after reviewing the three categories of evidence, then Form SS-8, Determination of Worker Status for Purposes of Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding PDF, can be filed with the IRS. The form may be filed by either the business or the worker. The IRS will review the facts and circumstances and officially determine the worker’s status.\n\nBe aware that it can take at least six months to get a determination. A business that continually hires the same types of workers to perform particular services may want to consider filing the Form SS-8 PDF.\n\nEmployment tax obligations\n\nOnce a determination is made (whether by the business or by the IRS), the next step is filing the appropriate forms and paying the associated taxes.\n\nMisclassification of employees\n\nConsequences of treating an employee as an independent contractor\n\nIf you classify an employee as an independent contractor and you have no reasonable basis for doing so, then you may be held liable for employment taxes for that worker (the relief provisions, discussed below, will not apply). See Internal Revenue Code section 3509 for more information.\n\nRelief provisions\n\nIf you have a reasonable basis for not treating a worker as an employee, then you may be relieved from having to pay employment taxes for that worker. To get this relief, you must file all required federal information returns on a basis consistent with your treatment of the worker. You (or your predecessor) must not have treated any worker holding a substantially similar position as an employee for any periods beginning after 1977. See Publication 1976, Section 530 Employment Tax Relief Requirements PDF, for more information.\n\nMisclassified workers can file Social Security tax form\n\nWorkers who believe they have been improperly classified as independent contractors by an employer can use Form 8919, Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages, to figure and report the employee’s share of uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes due on their compensation.\n\nVoluntary Classification Settlement Program"
