        "text": "We developed and tested a behavioral version of the Defining Issues Test-1 revised (DIT-1r), which is a measure of the development of moral judgment. We conducted a behavioral experiment using the behavioral Defining Issues Test (bDIT) to examine the relationship between participants’ moral developmental status, moral competence, and reaction time when making moral judgments. We found that when the judgments were made based on the preferred moral schema, the reaction time for moral judgments was significantly moderated by the moral developmental status. In addition, as a participant becomes more confident with moral judgment, the participant differentiates the preferred versus other schemas better particularly when the participant’s abilities for moral judgment are more developed.\n\nThe Defining Issues Test (DIT) has been widely used in psychological experiments to assess one’s developmental level of moral reasoning in terms of postconventional reasoning. However, there have been concerns regarding whether the tool is biased across people with different genders and political and religious views. To address the limitations, in the present study, I tested the validity of the brief version of the test, that is, the behavioral DIT, in terms of the measurement invariance and differential item functioning (DIF). I could not find any significant non-invariance at the test level or any item demonstrating practically significant DIF at the item level. The findings indicate that neither the test nor any of its items showed a significant bias toward any particular group. As a result, the collected validity evidence supports the use of test scores across different groups, enabling researchers who intend to examine participants’ moral reasoning development across heterogeneous groups to draw conclusions based on the scores.\n\nPromotion and inculcation of ethical decision making in the organization remains a prime concern in the fields of behavioral ethics and leadership. During the last decade, ethical leadership in the organization has been re-conceptualized in an effort to further this cause. Though, avid attention has been paid to ethical leadership style but the problems in the construct at the theoretical level has not been seen clearly, and due to this how it affects morality of employees in the organization was not studied closely. This research identified important theoretical and conceptual issues with ethical leadership construct and how it influences the moral judgment and moral identity-based moral motivation of followers in the organization. This study examined the specific ethical leadership construct, which is composed of two components: the moral person and the moral manager. Studying the construct as a whole and in parts, it was proposed that the moral person component leads employees to construct their personal moral judgment at higher levels of cognitive moral development model (CMD) while the moral manager component, and ethical leader leads employees to construct their moral judgment at low levels of CMD. In addition to explaining leader influences on employee’s CMD, it was also proposed that these components influence follower moral identity-based motivation. It was proposed that the moral person component crowds in moral identity (internalization) based moral motivation, while ethical leader and the moral manager component crowds in moral identity (symbolization) based moral motivation. Using quasi- experimental research design in educational institution setting (n = 176), it was partially supported that moral person component affects employees’ moral development positively at principled and conventional levels, as compared to moral managers and ethical leader who led employees to construct their morality at pre-conventional level. It was also supported that moral person crowds in moral motivation of employees, who are high on internalization dimension of moral identity in the absence of rewards, while ethical leader and moral manager crowds in moral motivation of employees who are high on symbolization dimension of moral identity, in the presence of rewards. The key implication of the study is that ethical leaders through moral management may affect both moral development and moral identity based moral motivation of employees negatively. Next, further implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed."
