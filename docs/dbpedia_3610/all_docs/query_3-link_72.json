        "text": "Revised September 2019\n\nNOTICE: The U.S. Department of Labor final rule, Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees, takes effect on July 1, 2024. The final rule updates and revises the regulations issued under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for executive, administrative, and professional (EAP) employees. Revisions include increases to the standard salary level and the highly compensated employee total annual compensation threshold, and a mechanism that provides for the timely and efficient updating of these earnings thresholds to reflect current earnings data. The information on this webpage will be updated shortly.\n\nThis fact sheet provides general information on the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay provided by Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA as defined by Regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 541.\n\nThe FLSA requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime pay at not less than time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.\n\nHowever, Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees. Section 13(a)(1) and Section 13(a)(17) also exempt certain computer employees. To qualify for exemption, employees generally must meet certain tests regarding their job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than $684* per week. Employers may use nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) paid on an annual or more frequent basis, to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary level. Job titles do not determine exempt status. In order for an exemption to apply, an employee’s specific job duties and salary must meet all the requirements of the Department’s regulations.\n\nSee other fact sheets in this series for more information on the exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside sales employees, and for more information on the salary basis requirement.\n\nExecutive Exemption\n\nTo qualify for the executive employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\n\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684* per week;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be managing the enterprise, or managing a customarily recognized department or subdivision of the enterprise;\n\nThe employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of at least two or more other full-time employees or their equivalent; and\n\nThe employee must have the authority to hire or fire other employees, or the employee’s suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees must be given particular weight.\n\nAdministrative Exemptions\n\nTo qualify for the administrative employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\n\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684* per week;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s customers; and\n\nThe employee’s primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.\n\nProfessional Exemption\n\nTo qualify for the learned professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\n\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684* per week;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge, defined as work which is predominantly intellectual in character and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment;\n\nThe advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning; and\n\nThe advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.\n\nTo qualify for the creative professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\n\nThe employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684* per week;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.\n\nComputer Employee Exemption\n\nTo qualify for the computer employee exemption, the following tests must be met:\n\nThe employee must be compensated either on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684* per week or, if compensated on an hourly basis, at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour;\n\nThe employee must be employed as a computer systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer or other similarly skilled worker in the computer field performing the duties described below;\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must consist of:\n\nThe application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;\n\nThe design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;\n\nThe design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or\n\nA combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.\n\nOutside Sales Exemption\n\nTo qualify for the outside sales employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:\n\nThe employee’s primary duty must be making sales (as defined in the FLSA), or obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer; and\n\nThe employee must be customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer’s place or places of business.\n\nHighly Compensated Employees\n\nHighly compensated employees performing office or non-manual work and paid total annual compensation of $107,432 or more (which must include at least $684* per week paid on a salary or fee basis) are exempt from the FLSA if they customarily and regularly perform at least one of the duties of an exempt executive, administrative or professional employee identified in the standard tests for exemption.\n\nBlue-Collar Workers\n\nThe exemptions provided by FLSA Section 13(a)(1) apply only to “white-collar” employees who meet the salary and duties tests set forth in the Part 541 regulations. The exemptions do not apply to manual laborers or other “blue-collar” workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. FLSA-covered, non-management employees in production, maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime premium pay under the FLSA, and are not exempt under the Part 541 regulations no matter how highly paid they might be.\n\nPolice, Fire Fighters, Paramedics & Other First Responders\n\nThe exemptions also do not apply to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators, inspectors, correctional officers, parole or probation officers, park rangers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, ambulance personnel, rescue workers, hazardous materials workers and similar employees, regardless of rank or pay level, who perform work such as preventing, controlling or extinguishing fires of any type; rescuing fire, crime or accident victims; preventing or detecting crimes; conducting investigations or inspections for violations of law; performing surveillance; pursuing, restraining and apprehending suspects; detaining or supervising suspected and convicted criminals, including those on probation or parole; interviewing witnesses; interrogating and fingerprinting suspects; preparing investigative reports; or other similar work.\n\nOther Laws & Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\nThe FLSA provides minimum standards that may be exceeded, but cannot be waived or reduced. Employers must comply, for example, with any Federal, State or municipal laws, regulations or ordinances establishing a higher minimum wage or lower maximum workweek than those established under the FLSA. Similarly, employers may, on their own initiative or under a collective bargaining agreement, provide a higher wage, shorter workweek, or higher overtime premium than provided under the FLSA. While collective bargaining agreements cannot waive or reduce FLSA protections, nothing in the FLSA or the Part 541 regulation relieves employers from their contractual obligations under such bargaining agreements."
