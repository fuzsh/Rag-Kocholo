The study included one primary research question, with two subquestions. The primary research question asked to what extent students in the program developed moral judgment consistent with program goals of rehabilitating students and preparing them for effective ministry. The first subquestion asked whether statistically significant differences existed in the moral reasoning of students of different class years. The second subquestion asked whether statistically significant differences\n\nexisted in the moral reasoning of students of different personality types.\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with students during the fall of 2005 using the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT-2) and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) instruments. All 101 program students were invited to participate in the study. To provide a benchmark for student scores, 30 Seminary faculty members were asked to complete the DIT-2. The student response rates were 94% for the DIT-2 instrument and 97% for\n\nthe MBTI instrument. The response rate for faculty was 20%.\n\nAfter removing two outliers from the freshmen class, statistically significant differences were found in the principled moral reasoning scores (P scores) of freshmen (m = 22.146, sd = 12.002) and juniors (m = 30.274, sd = 13.165). No significant differences were found in moral reasoning based upon personality types. The mean P score among faculty members was 34.02 (sd = 15.25). In response to the primary\n\nresearch question, it was determined student scores did show moral reasoning differences consistent with the program goals. Conclusions reached in this study were limited because of the cross-sectional design. Further research is necessary before conclusions may be generalized beyond the sample.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to compare James R.

Rest's Defining Issues Test and Georg Lind's M oral Judgment Test in terms of theory and practice. It is known that both of them are most widely used tests to measure moral judgment throughout the world. With this aim, in this article, firstly both scientists' theories and own studies on tests are handled theoretically. Then some academic studies of these tests applied in Turkey are mentioned. Finally, findings and comments of this research related to DIT and M JT are revealed. Both tests were performed on a group of 251 students in studying various programs of Artvin Çoruh and Ondokuz M ayıs universities in 2012-2013 academic year. In research process, relational scanning model was used, and in data analysis SPSS 16.0 statistical program was applied. To determine the correlation between DIT and M JT tests, Pearson moments correlation test was used. In order to see relationship between both tests and independent variables benefited from t-test and ANOVA. As a result, it was revealed that the main theoretical difference between both tests is DIT's step priority and M JT's step consistency. Besides, it was also concluded that tests are structurally different from each other. The results of data analysis demonstrated that there was no significant relationship (r=-0,02) between P-Point of DIT scale and C-point of M JT scale; between stu\n\nThe study reported here sought to examine the ethical orientations of business managers and business students in Singapore.

Data were obtained using Defining Issue Test. Analysis of Variance revealed that age, education and religious affiliation had influenced cognitive moral development stages of the respondents. Vocation, gender and ethnicity did not seem to have affected moral judgement of the subjects. Contrary to the general view, both business students and business managers demonstrated the same level of sensitivity to ethical dimensions of decision-making. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.\n\nThis research focuses on the similarities and differences in the cognitive moral development of business professionals and graduate business students in two countries, India and the United States.

Factors that potentially influence cognitive moral development, namely, culture, education, sex and gender are analyzed and discussed. Implications for ethics education in graduate business schools and professional associations are considered. Future research on the cognitive moral development of graduate business students and business professionals is recommended.\n\nThis study responds to Bay and Greenberg's (Bay, D.D. and Greenberg, R.R.

The relationship of the DIT and behavior: A replication. Issues in Accounting Education 10(3): 367–380) call to investigate alternative psychometric instruments to measure ethical behavior other than the heavily relied upon Defining Issues Test. The Mach IV scale (Christie, 1970) has been cited in more than 500 published psychological studies; however, it has not been used extensively in the accounting ethics research. This study provides some preliminary evidence on the use of the Mach IV scale in an accounting ethics context. Similar to ethics studies in other academic disciplines, results across two dependent measures indicate accounting students high in Machiavellianism are more likely to view questionable ethical behavior as acceptable. The research findings also indicate that the Machiavellian construct appears to be a better predictor of ethical propensities in comparison to the commonly used Defining Issues Test. The paper concludes with a discussion on how these reported research findings impact the accounting profession and accounting education.\n\nThis research examines the association between attitudes on cheating and cognitive moral development.

In this research, we use Rest's (1979a) Defining Issues Test, the Attitudes on Honesty Scale (Authors) and Academic Integrity Index (Authors); the last two are adaptations of the DIT. A total of 220 students from three universities participated in the study (66 psychology majors and 154 business majors). The data indicate that 66.4 percent of the students reported that they cheated in high school, college, or both high school and college. Psychology majors scored higher than business majors on both the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1979a) and the Attitudes on Honesty Scale (AHS, Authors). Using factor analysis, we found significant associations between students' ratings of the importance considerations present in the three cheating scenarios and their estimates of whether cheating would occur (i.e., the Academic Integrity Index). Finally, using logistic regression, we found that the scores on the Attitudes on Honesty Scale and Academic Integrity Index associate with the self-reported cheating behavior of college students.\n\nThe importance of teaching computer ethics is shown by its inclusion as core content in both in- formation systems and computer science model curricula.

This paper outlines a method for evalu- ating undergraduate computer ethics programs using the Defining Issues Test of moral judgment. A &quot;before-and-after with a control group&quot; research design was used. The experimental group ex- hibited a significantly larger increase in moral judgment development than the control group. This indicates that computer ethics teaching is having a useful effect on students&#x27; ethical development.\n\nABSTRACT.

A review was conducted of 55 studies of education interven-tions designed to stimulate development in moral judgment. All studies used the Defining Issues Test. Various subject groups were involved (junior and senior high school students, college and graduate students, adults), various types of programs were employed (group discussion of moral dilemmas, psychological development programs, social studies and hu-manities courses), and the duration of the programs varied (a few hours to a year-long program). The principal findings from meta-analysis indi-cate that the dilemma discussion and psychological development programs produce modest overall effect sizes, that treatments of about 3 to 12 weeks are optimal, and that programs with adults (24 years and older) produce larger effect sizes than with younger subjects; however, significant effect sizes are obtained with all groups. Over the past decade, considerable interest and investment has been devoted to devising moral edu...\n\nFunctional theories of attitudes address why people hold attitudes.

The current study had two main goals: to extend the study of attitude functions, and to relate these functions to moral development. One hundred seventy-four participants filled out a revision of Herek&#39;s (1987) Attitude Functions Inventory (AFI) and a short form of Rest&#39;s (1979) Defining Issues Test (DIT). Factor analysis on the AFI revealed 7 factors, corresponding to several defined attitude functions. Multiple regression analyses revealed that moral stage-typical reasoning, as assessed by the DIT, is significantly related to attitude functions in a theoretically consistent manner. Implications for the future study of attitude functions and their bases in moral thought are discussed. Functional theories of attitudes are interesting--and perhaps intuitive--for several reasons (Herek, 1987). Most notably, functional theories address why people hold attitudes. This allows researchers to answer ultimate questi...\n\nThe purposes of this study were to describe and compare the emotional-social intelligence (ESI) of students in nursing, physical therapy and health science programs, and to determine the relationship between ESI and each of leadership,... more\n\nThe purposes of this study were to describe and compare the emotional-social intelligence (ESI) of students in nursing, physical therapy and health science programs, and to determine the relationship between ESI and each of leadership, caring and moral judgment.
