        "text": "The 2024 Global Internal Audit Standards incorporate all the mandatory elements of the 2017 IPPF, including the Definition of Internal Auditing, Mission of Internal Audit, Code of Ethics, Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Additionally, the recommended guidance contained in the 2017 Implementation Guides also has been incorporated into the 2024 Standards as considerations for implementation and examples of evidence of conformance. These elements are no longer considered separate elements of the framework.\n\nYes, the 2017 IPPF and International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing remain valid until January 8, 2025. However, early adoption the 2024 IPPF and Global Internal Audit Standards is encouraged, and as of January 9, 2025, internal audit functions should use only the 2024 versions since quality assessments will be evaluated using those versions beginning on that date.\n\nThe Standards will be effective for quality assessments January 9, 2025, 12 months after the date of the Standards publication. Learn more by watching the “What the New Standards Mean to Quality Assessments” webinar.\n\nOptions for conducting your next external quality assessment.\n\nIf your next assessment is due in 2024, you should proceed with your assessment when due under the existing IPPF.\n\nIf your assessment is due in 2025, you can choose to accelerate your assessment under the existing IPPF in 2024. The IIA recommends adding a supplementary gap/readiness assessment to assess how well your function is prepared to implement the new Standards.\n\nGap/readiness assessments may be scheduled at any point to help your internal audit function prepare to implement the new Standards effectively.\n\nFor more information about external quality assessments, please visit Quality Services."
