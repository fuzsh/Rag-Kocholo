        "text": "Instructions\n\nOn the next page, you will be asked to complete the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2). This questionnaire is concerned with how you define the issues in a social problem. Based on Lawrence Kohlberg’s theory of moral development, these issues ask you to judge what is important when making a decision. The DIT-2 presents you five very short stories, each describing a different ethical dilemma. After reading each situation, you are asked to decide on a course of action, rate the importance of 12 issues pertaining to the situation, and rank the four most important elements influencing your evaluation of the situation.\n\nAs you complete the DIT-2, please keep in mind:\n\nOnce the results have been processed you will receive a score for this test, and our interpretation of the Duke results overall.\n\nIf you have any questions about the study or the DIT-2 questionnaire, you are welcome to contact The Office of Assessment, at assessment@duke.edu\n\nClick here to begin the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2)\n\nThe questionnaire will open in a new window so that you can continue to refer to the instructions listed above."
