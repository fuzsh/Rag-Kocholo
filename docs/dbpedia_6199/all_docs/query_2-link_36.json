        "text": "You founded your business to serve a purpose: to provide for your family, to fill a void in the marketplace, to service the people of your community—perhaps all the above. Searching for capital to invest in your business should not tear down what you’ve spent years building. At Trivest, we strive to maintain the culture that a founder has worked tirelessly to preserve. We strongly believe that a company’s culture is a key determinate of success. You put your business first, and we will, too.\n\nWhen opening your family-owned business to those outside of the family, seek investors that will treat you like partners. Find a private equity firm that will align interests to carry your business through its next stages of growth and development, while leaving your legacy in place.\n\nFor more than 40 years, Trivest has been exclusively focused on the support and growth of founder-led and family-owned businesses.\n\nConsidering outside investment is a pivotal decision for any business owner. As the founder of your business, choosing the right private equity firm builds the foundation of a long-term business partnership as well as the future you see for your company.\n\nYour business, your culture. You deserve a private equity firm that respects that. At Trivest, we believe in aligning our interests with those of the management team at each company. We do not use an operating partner model—meaning we don’t “parachute” Trivest employees into your company post-closing to run operations. Instead, we serve as active board members, providing management teams with the flexibility to operate and preserve their company culture.\n\nWe invest in well-run, profitable businesses. It is our job to elevate that business, not uproot it. We treat founders as transparent, fair, and honest investment partners, navigating each company through its next stage of growth and development. Trivest deploys its capital and network of resources to build stronger businesses. More +\n\nThe Trivest Promise is one we take to heart. We work hard to eliminate the typical pain points in a transaction—the ones that give our industry a bad rap. Bottom line: we close at the price in our LOI.\n\nWe are committed to promoting and fostering a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the organization. We believe in creating an atmosphere of mutual respect by attracting, retaining, and promoting individuals of all backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities.\n\nAs a firm, we take corporate responsibility seriously, and as a proactive step, Trivest is now a signatory of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nAward Disclosure\n\nBluWave’s Top Private Equity Innovator Award recognizes firms that it considers represent the top 2% in the private equity industry in innovative practices in areas such as proactive due diligence practices, transformative value creation, progressive private equity firm operations and ESG. BluWave’s determinations are based on its assessment criteria and consultation of limited partners, investment bankers and third parties in the private equity industry. Such opinions and beliefs are subjective. Trivest did not pay any compensation to BluWave or any third party in connection with its receipt of this award. However, BluWave may otherwise provide services to the PE firms and/or portfolio companies, but BluWave confirms that its assessment of the PE firms was independent of any such service arrangements. Trivest received this award in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Please visit https://www.bluwave.net/awards/ for additional information.\n\nAdditional awards disclosures can be found on our Legal page."
