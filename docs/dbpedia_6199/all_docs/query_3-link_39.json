        "text": "Looks as though the record for priciest California home sale ever has been broken yet again, this time by a giant compound in Malibu. At $177 million, the sold price eclipses the previous record — set last year by Jeff Bezos in Beverly Hills — by $12 million. Apparel mogul Serge Azria and his wife, Florence, were the lucky sellers, while the buyers were Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and his wife, Laura Arrillaga, who’s hugely rich in her own right as the only daughter of multibillionaire real estate developer John Arrillaga. The off-market deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nUnfathomable though the price may be, this property is loaded with amenities that could make the $177 million figure seem almost worth it to some folks — or at least remotely palatable. For one thing, the blufftop property is located directly above Paradise Cove, perhaps the most gorgeous beach in all of Malibu.\n\nExclusive: I can tell you that Focus Features is not for sale -- yet anyway -- and Universal hasn't even had one conversation with Comcast about putting the specialty house in play (and can't until the deal gets regulatory approval). So much for all that Internet chatter tonight about the Gores Brothers wanting to buy Focus. The bros and several other companies like Relativity and Mrc have made offers for Focus over the past year -- Alec and Tom Gores put in an offer very recently -- but Universal hasn't even gone back to anyone with a counter-offer and I understand won't for the forseeable future. \"People make offers all the time,\" an insider tells me. \"Nothing is happening now, either.\"...\n\nUpdated: Universal Pictures is in early talks to sell Focus Features to brothers Alec and Tom Gores, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nDiscussions are in the preliminary stages. If a sale goes through, Universal could divest itself of its specialty film division before the NBC Universal merger with Comcast happens next year.\n\nThe Gores made an attempt to buy Miramax earlier this year and also considered Overture Films’ Starz Media. They recently acquired Alliance Entertainment LLC, a DVD and video game distributor.\n\nTalks have apparently been going on for several weeks, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times, and people close to the situation said a deal is not guaranteed.\n\nThe Gores declined to comment through their spokespeople. A Focus spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n“Over time we have gotten a lot of offers for Focus Features, be we are not in active negotiations to sell Focus,” a Universal spokesperson said.\n\nUniversal Pictures is not currently in negotitions to sell Focus Features, its specialty film division, and according to sources, no talks about any possible deal are scheduled.\n\n\"Over time we have gotten a lot of offers for Focus, but there are no active negotiations taking place at this time,\" a studio spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter Friday in response to report in the Los Angeles Times that the brothers Alec and Tom Gores are in talks to buy the unit.\n\nWhile the Gores brothers have made an informal proposal to buy Focus, due to the pending merger of the NBC Universal assets with Comcast, any deal is unlikely in the midst of regulatory reviews. Comcast may not get clearance for weeks or months to close the merger, and there can be no sale of Focus or any other of Universal's major assets until after merger is completed.\n\nUniversal has fielded...\n\nThe Weinstein brothers and their key backer in a $625 million bid for Miramax issued a short statement Friday afternoon to counter press reports that their deal with Disney had fallen apart.\n\nThe statement reads: \"The Weinstein Brothers, The Weinstein Company and Ron Burkle are all working towards a deal to purchase and operate Miramax. The parties continue to work diligently towards an agreement.\"\n\nThe short statement is intended to counter claims that talks with Disney are off due to problems with the structure of the deal, and that, as one report had it, Disney is not satisfied that Burkle's Yucaipa Companies will put up the money as promised, a reported $300 million-plus in equity.\n\nThe rest of the money is supposed to be \"mezzanine level\" financing put together by New York hedge funds Fortress-Colbeck. Part of that is to be backed by receivables -- money contracted for but not yet paid...\n\nTalks to hammer out final details are ongoing in the envisioned purchase of Walt Disney Co's Miramax films by Hollywood producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein and billionaire Ron Burkle's Yucaipa Cos, sources said on Friday.But a third source said the deal appears near a breaking point amid disagreements between the buyers over control of the unit.Two sources with knowledge of the situation denied reports in the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times that the deal had fallen through, saying talks are continuing. Yucaipa Cos and Weinstein Company have launched a $625 million bid for Miramax, which has a library of more than 600 films including &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;The English Patient.&quot;But a third source said discussions have hit a roadblock for now, as tensions emerged between the two would-be buyers.The parties entered into an exclusive negotiating window in April on the sale of Miramax.\n\n0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false Every time I turn around, I feel like I'm reading something about how Bob and Harvey Weinstein have no money. From their parting ways with Miramax (the company that made them indie icons) to the floundering of their latest venture, The Weinstein Company, it feels as if every story about the brothers lately might have been written on the reverse side of a cardboard sign that says, \"Will Work for Independent Financing.\"\n\nAnd yet the scuttling of their glory days - coming in the form of Disney's auctioning off of the famous Miramax label - has the brothers in money-raising mode to buy back their old Hollywood stomping grounds. And for two brothers with widely reported financial woes, apparently they've generated a $600 million bid.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter:\n\nMiramax founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein had been building enough financial muscle to put together...\n\nBy Roger Friedman\n\nMiramax–the name and the catalog–may finally be returned to its rightful owners, the Weinstein brothers.\n\nI was the first to write several months ago that once Disney decided to close Miramax, they should give the name back to the Weinsteins. Well, Disney does nothing for free, except when you wish upon a star. So the Weinsteins are in the middle of talks to buy it all back. They’re joined supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle, who also owns half the debt of Barneys department stores and most of Sean P Diddy Combs.\n\nThere are others in the bid for Miramax, including billionaire brothers Alec and Tom Gores, whose brother Sam owns the Paradigm Talent Agency and is married to former “Another World” star Jensen Buchanan. The other horse in the race belongs to David Bergstein, who once owned ThinkFilm.\n\nBergstein is a terrible choice. He destroyed...\n\nBriefly: Going to keep this one short until more detail comes in, but here are the basics. About an hour ago THR ran a piece saying that Bob and Harvey Weinstein would again be in control of the Miramax name and library thanks to a $600m bid made with/through Ron Burkle and a small consortium of financiers. But Deadline insists that Disney is denying the report. Nikki Finke says that Disney just said, on the record, \"no [Miramax] deal done and reports to the contrary are false\". So which is it? Recently, rival bidders Alec and Tom Gores had reportedly leapt to the forefront of the dealmaking process with a $550m cash offer. But Disney could still sell to Burkle, through whom the Weinsteins would end up controlling their old library once more. We'll keep an eye on this one and I'll update when more info comes to light.\n\nIt looks as if the Weinsteins have managed to fashion a winning bid in the Miramax auction and will take back operating control of the company they founded in 1979 and sold to Disney for $80 million in 1993.\n\nRunning the process internally, the Burbank studio for months has been soliciting offers for the recently shut specialty-film unit and its 611-title library.\n\nMiramax founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein had been building enough financial muscle to put together an offer of $600 million or thereabouts, seeking to top bids from such rival suitors as businessmen Alec and Tom Gores and a more controversial one from Hollywood wheeler-dealer David Bergstein.\n\nHarvey and Bob Weinstein have been kibitzing with billionaire financier Ron Burkle throughout the auction process. In addition to Burkle's Yucaipa group, the duo's backers include hedge funds Fortress and Colbeck Capital. In effect, Burkle and friends would be the official buyers, but the Weinsteins effectively would run the operation.\n\nThere might be a reason why bids for Miramax are coming in under what Disney would have liked, and it's not just recession-weary cost-consciousness at play.\n\nRather, the library is a maze of disparate titles and murky rights. Yes, there are 14 prestige titles that competed for best picture Oscars, three of which nabbed the statuette, but there also is a lot of straight-to-video fare, quirky art pics with little remake potential and other films whose ownership is unclear or hopelessly split.\n\nEven the size of the library has been misstated over and over again. Various reports have placed it at 700 movies, but there are actually only 611 (plus 220 hours of TV episodes) and only slightly more than half of those movies got a domestic theatrical release and can be considered salable quality movies that have potential to keep generating significant revenue.\n\nThere also are five unreleased movies in the mix: Julie Taymor's adaptation of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\"; the Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy \"The Switch\" (formerly \"The Baster\")..."
