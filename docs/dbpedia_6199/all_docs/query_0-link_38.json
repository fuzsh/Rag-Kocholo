        "text": "Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores is headed back to his home court.\n\nGores, who is also the chairman and chief executive of private equity firm Platinum Equity, dropped $38 million to acquire his former Beverly Park home, the Los Angeles Times reported. He sold it to developers Gala Asher and Ed Berman for $40 million in October 2016, property records show.\n\nGores traded the home, as well as 3.2 acres of undeveloped land in Bel Air, last year as part of a deal to acquire a newly built, $100 million spec house on Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills. That property, which sits on Barbra Streisand’s former “Mon Rêve” estate, spans 38,000 square feet.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nThe 24,000-square-foot Beverly Park pad, designed by Donald Ayres, contains seven bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, an expansive swimming pool, outdoor lounge area and several gardens.\n\nGores originally paid $21 million to acquire the property in 2010. It hit the market asking $49 million in March."
