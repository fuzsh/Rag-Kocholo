        "text": "Chair, Chief Executive\n\nPlatinum Equity\n\nGores founded private equity firm Platinum Equity in 1995, which has since grown to a $48 billion global firm. Gores has a net worth of about $7.3 billion and was No. 11 on the Business Journal’s Wealthiest Angelenos list last year. While his Los Angeles firm continues to climb in assets, his NBA team the Detroit Pistons has seen its fair share of trouble in the past year, finishing last place in the league. Despite calls from fans to sell the team, Gores so far has shown no signs of leaving his basketball team, which he acquired fully in 2015, behind. The Gores family is originally from Flint, Michigan. Tom Gores went to Michigan State University. In 2016, Gores launched FlintNOW, a $10 million private sector campaign to support relief initiatives in response to the Flint water crisis."
