        "text": "Cision, the major media insights and comms software company has been acquired by private equity firm, Platinum Equity. The deal is worth $2.74 billion.\n\nCisionâs media monitoring tools are used across the industry. The conglomerate has been growing rapidly through their own acquisitions, 12 in the last 5 years, including social intelligence and management company Falcon.io, PR insights firm TrendKite and social media intelligence and benchmarking company Unmetric.\n\nPlatinum Equity Partner Jacob Kotzubei said: \"Cision has a long history of leadership providing software and services to public relations and marketing communications professionals and has developed a growing portfolio of earned media management offerings for the world's leading brands. Platinum looks forward to nurturing Cision's core business, supporting and anticipating the diverse needs of the company's customers, and driving new opportunities for innovation.â\n\nâ\n\nWhy should we care?\n\nThereâs been a lot of this kind of news over the last few years. Itâs positive for those of us in social intelligence, an industry which in the past has been seen as fragmented. Big deals like this show confidence and certainty in the industry and go against the idea of fragmented tech startups. Yet more proof that social intelligence has an important place in martech.\n\nItâs also likely that the M&A activity from other players in the industry will continue, stay tuned for more updates.\n\nâ\n\nAbout Cision\n\nCision Ltd.
