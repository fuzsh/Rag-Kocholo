        "text": "Tom Gores, a private equity investor, has made a fortune buying out-of-favor businesses and turning them around. Fans of the Detroit Pistons, the National Basketball Association franchise coming off two miserable seasons, are hoping he can work some of his turnaround magic on the hapless franchise.\n\nAfter months of speculation, Mr. Gores signed an agreement last Friday to buy the team from Karen Davidson, the widow of the longtime owner, Bill Davidson.\n\nMr. Gores, a native of Flint, Mich., will pay $300 million to $400 million for the team in a transaction that also includes the Palace of Auburn Hills arena and the DTE Energy Music Theater, according to The Detroit Free Press. The deal is subject to approval by the N.B.A. board of governors.\n\nIn recent days, there have been questions raised in the media, including a piece by Dan Primack of Fortune, over whether Mr. Gores or his private equity firm, the Los Angeles-based Platinum Equity, is buying the team.\n\nThe purchase, according to a news release, is being made by Mr. Gores and Platinum Equity. Mr. Gores will be the primary owner, according to people briefed on the deal who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Still, if approved, Platinum would be among the first private equity firms to own a stake in a professional sports team.\n\nN.B.A. officials are meeting with Mr. Gores in New York on Thursday. Detroit’s sportswriters are also wondering about the deal. “What kind of owner will you be?” mused Mitch Albom, the Detroit Free Press sports columnist, over the weekend.\n\nMr. Gores’s purchase comes as a number of moneymen, including the hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen, are bidding for a minority stake in the New York Mets. The vast wealth created on Wall Street over the past two decades has led to financiers — mostly hedge fund and private equity executives — taking ownership stakes in professional sport teams. In Boston, for instance, the Red Sox is owned by John William Henry II, a hedge fund trader, while the Celtics are owned by a group of private equity executives, including a cluster from Bain Capital.\n\nDealBook has a few insights for N.B.A. officials and the Detroit media on the new presumptive owner. Two years ago this reporter spent a day with the charismatic Mr. Gores, whose Platinum Equity owns a range of companies, including the newspaper company San Diego Union Tribune and the steel distributor Ryerson. With a shock of thick black hair speckled with gray and a jeans-and-T-shirt wardrobe, Mr. Gores, 46, looks more like an aged rock star than a button-downed Wall Street deal maker.\n\nMr. Gores is one of three accomplished brothers. His oldest brother, Sam, runs Paradigm talent agency, which represents artists like Coldplay and actors including Mariska Hargitay. The other brother, Alec, runs Gores Group, another Los Angeles private equity firm where Tom worked before leaving in the mid 1990s. (His three sisters also live in the Los Angeles area.)\n\nAnd while leveraged buyouts have earned him his riches — Forbes magazine pegs his net worth at $2.4 billion — spend time with Mr. Gores and you’ll likely hear as much about coaching his children’s sports teams as you will about private equity. Of course, many a Wall Street executive trumpets the fact that they coach little league as evidence of their commitment to family and the ability to maintain a work-life balance. But Mr. Gores takes this to another level.\n\nIn 2006, Mr. Gores paid more than $30 million for eight acres in Beverly Hills, a property sandwiched between the homes of the media mogul David Geffen and the supermarket magnate Ronald Burkle. He didn’t build a home there, but instead leveled the property and built a soccer field and basketball court to hold practice for his children’s squads.\n\nMr. Gores proudly shows off home movies of games on his MacBook. In one, Mr. Gores delivers a Vince Lombardi-esque sideline speech to the Purple Passion, his daughter’s traveling soccer team. “Never give up!” he shouted. “Never give up!”\n\nInterview friends of Mr. Gores’s, a group that includes some of Los Angeles’s most prominent businessmen, and they invariably mention Mr. Gores’s passion for sports, especially basketball. (Fans of the Los Angeles Lakers might recognize Mr. Gores from his regular seat on the Staples Center floor next to Jack Nicholson.) But what they mainly highlight is Mr. Gores’s avocation.\n\n“The guy’s the best coach I’ve ever seen,” said Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of video game maker Activision Blizzard, who has been friends with Mr. Gores for more than 20 years and whose children have played for him. “It sounds hokey, but the same qualities he brings to the soccer field – his charisma, his energy and his intensity – are what makes him successful in business.” Mr. Kotick added: “He also has an intuitive money-making gene, and that’s something you either have or you don’t.”\n\nKenneth D. Moelis, chief executive of the investment bank Moelis & Company, has helped coach the basketball squad that his and Mr. Gores’s teenage daughters joined. Throughout the season, Mr. Gores would send Mr. Moelis e-mails with lengthy critiques of the team’s progress. In the spring of 2008, just hours after the team lost by a point in the championship game, Mr. Gores was pensive.\n\n“We will strive to be better next year,” Mr. Gores wrote in one e-mail. “What else is there? Tough for you and I to swallow but the journey was good and in the big picture everybody won. Don’t worry I am still in pain. Tomorrow is a new day.”\n\nJust as it is for the Detroit Pistons."
