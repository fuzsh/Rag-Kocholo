Here he developed his principles of empowerment, hard work, and integrity. As he delivered on commitments made to deal partners, investment bankers, and lenders,Mr. Gores'sability to continually execute larger transactions grew exponentially and made Platinum Equity one of the premiere private equity firms in the world, recognized as one of Forbes' s \"Largest Private Companies\" within just 4 years of beingfounded. Believing that a team of outstanding people could meet almost any challenge,Mr. Goresbegan selecting the best and brightest he came in contact with to join him. The result is the Partners and Principals who lead Platinum Equity today. Strong relationships, trust in people, and open communication remain key toMr. Gores'sand Platinum Equity'smomentum. When it comes to his business,Mr. Goresapplies philosophies of swift and thorough diligence, sound acquisitions, effective management, and driving value through honest, intelligent operational improvement rather than financial engineering.
