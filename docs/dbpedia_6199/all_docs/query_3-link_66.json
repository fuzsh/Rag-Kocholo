        "text": "A new season in the National Basketball Association (NBA) looms with the league at rare risk of being on the wrong side of a social policy debate.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons’ billionaire owner Tom Gores is under considerable pressure to sell his stake in Securus Technologies Inc, a group accused of profiteering in its supply of phone services to prisoners and their families. Charges can be as high as US$25 for a 15-minute call. Gores insists that he reinvests his personal income from the shareholding back into Securus’ efforts to drive down costs – but the Platinum Equity founder has already given up his seat on the board of trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nAhead of this week’s tip-off, Worth Rises, which campaigns for prison and judicial reform, has called on NBA commissioner Adam Silver to remove Gores from the league’s board and push for the sale of the Pistons. On Sunday, it took out a full-page ad in the New York Times, framed as an open letter to the owners of the rest of the NBA’s teams, asking, ‘If Black Lives Matter, what are you doing about Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores?’\n\nSpeaking to ESPN, Worth Rises founder and executive director Bianca Tylek said the group was opposed to the idea of companies that have “a vested interest in people's incarceration”.\n\nThe Pistons are said to have referred requests for comment to Platinum Equity but an NBA spokesperson told ESPN that Gores shared Tylek’s “passion for reform” and encouraged a direct dialogue. Mark Burnhill, a Platinum Equity partner and alternate governor at the Pistons, claimed Worth Rises had declined collaboration in favour of “shouting from an isolated fringe”.\n\nHunger for crossovers\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA has gobbled up one more licensing deal before the delayed start of the 2020/21 campaign – a tie-in with Pac-Man videogame publisher Bandai Namco.\n\nIn a partnership designed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the debut of everyone’s favourite half-eaten pizza-shaped, ghost-baiting arcade character, the two parties will collaborate on a series of co-branded products. From 22nd December, when the new NBA season begins, official league power-ups and mazes will appear in the Pac-Man mobile game. Other ‘safe, in-home Pac-tivities’ are also promised.\n\nElsewhere in the world of nostalgic basketball-themed promotional exercises, Microsoft has agreed a deal with Warner Brothers to create educational content around LeBron James movie vehicle Space Jam: A New Legacy – sequel to the 1997 release starring Michael Jordan. It will create programmes that encourage young people to learn coding and other digital skills. One initiative will see fans invited to try and develop a Space Jam videogame for the Microsoft Xbox.\n\nSpace Jam: A New Legacy’s oddly familiar plot will follow James and his young son Dom, ‘who dreams of being a video game developer’, as they bid to escape from being ‘trapped in a digital space by a rogue AI’ by teaming up with the Looney Toons to beat ‘a powered-up roster of basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before’.\n\nAdded kick\n\nSky Sports has made a UK£3 million commitment to the soccer equality group Kick It Out. The Comcast-owned UK pay-TV network has agreed a three-year deal to act as the broadcast media partner for the charity’s campaigns.\n\nAccording to The Times, that contribution will be split between cash and value in kind and comes after Kick It Out adapted its constitution to allow for commercial support. It also forms part of Sky Sports’ UK£10 million a year anti-racism drive. In June, the company announced plans to combat discrimination and use its platform to highlight inequality in sport. That has so far included branding and regular editorial segment across its output in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and similar causes.\n\nPlaying the game\n\nThe digital gaming economy, a rare net beneficiary of stay-at-home and social distancing measures throughout 2020, had its biggest ever month in November. Nielsen’s SuperData arm recorded a 15 per cent year-on-year rise in global revenues to US$11.5 billion across consoles, mobile and PC gaming.\n\nNew releases NBA 2K1 and FIFA 21 were the second and fifth-highest-grossing games in the world respectively on console.\n\nStay up to date with the latest sports business news and insights.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nInvesting in talent\n\nTwo US athlete representation agencies are heading into 2021 with fresh sources of cash. Mark Steinberg’s Excel Sports Management, whose 180 clients include Tiger Woods and Blake Griffin, has received its first ever injection of external funding from Shamrock Capital Investment, whose other interests in sport include stakes in Israeli tech startup Pixellot and fantasy sports operator FanDuel.\n\nShamrock has US$2.1 billion of assets under management and, according to Forbes, usually invests at least US$30 million into new ventures.\n\nMeanwhile, agency giant Endeavor has taken a stake in BDA Sports Management and appointed its founder, Bill Duffy, as a strategic advisor to WME Sports. BDA is America’s longest-established black-owned sports agency and is best known for its work in the NBA. Duffy, a former Denver Nuggets player, has represented stars like Steve Nash, Yao Ming and Luka Dončić.\n\nFirst of the week\n\nA small piece of history will be made early in the new year in Catalonia. FC Barcelona Femini, the Spanish soccer giants’ women’s team, will make an official debut at the Camp Nou on 6th January when they play local rivals Espanyol in the Primera Iberdrola.\n\nThe side have been playing at the Estadi Johan Cruyff since 2019 but will head across town to mark the 50th anniversary of a game at the Camp Nou between Selecció Ciutat Barcelona – considered the forerunner of today’s professional women’s team – and CSKA Sofia. That match was played in front of 60,000 fans on Christmas Day 1970; the near 100,000-capacity stadium will be empty of spectators in a couple of weeks due to Covid-19 restrictions. Still, there will now be some expectation that the women can return again when fans do.\n\nReclassification of the week\n\n“All of us who love baseball have long known that the Negro Leagues produced many of our game's best players, innovations and triumphs against a backdrop of injustice. We are now grateful to count the players of the Negro Leagues where they belong: as Major Leaguers within the official historical record.”\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) commissioner Rob Manfred confirms the long-overdue decision to reclassify the seven segregation-era Negro Leagues, which featured around 3,400 elite African-American players from 1920 to 1948, as major leagues. The move ensures those players’ records will be added to MLB rolls, and follows a series of events to recognise the Negro Leagues centenary in August.\n\nMLB has also described the 1969 call by the Special Committee on Baseball Records to omit the leagues from top-tier classification as ‘a mistake’.\n\nHalf measures\n\n‘It is difficult to understand why the most serious breach of anti-doping rules and sport values will not receive the same sanction of four years that any individual athlete would receive for cheating deliberately.’\n\nAn Institute for National Doping Associations (iNADO) statement encapsulates the opposition to last week’s Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) decision to halve the ban meted out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to Russian teams competing in global competition.\n\nA further tweak will allow Russian participants to appear in what will effectively be their team colours, so long as the phrase ‘neutral athlete’ is as prominent as the word ‘Russia’ on their uniforms, but the flag and national anthem will be barred from Olympic and world championship events for two years.\n\nA Cas statement said its panel had ‘considered matters of proportionality and, in particular, the need to effect cultural change and encourage the next generation of Russian athletes to participate in clean international sport’ – an approach some have questioned in itself, asking whether it steps beyond the bounds of legal detachment.\n\nHere we go again"
