        "text": "Dropping in on Platinum Equity is an adventure in cognitive dissonance. It's a tad odd in such an opulent setting to hear Tom Gores, founder and chief executive of the buyout firm, talk about getting his hands dirty running a garbage truck maker, a troubled real estate business or a distressed auto parts distributor. But Gores and his 19 principals and partners like their comforts: The 90,000-square-foot headquarters on North Crescent Drive in Beverly Hills is a temple of Art Deco architecture and museum-quality furniture. The place has a storied, if very mixed, roster of past tenants: Music Corp. of America, Litton Industries and the spectacular flameout Global Crossing . Then again, Gores, 45, is at home with paradox. \"When everyone [else] is scared about the market, we go to work.\"\n\nThe recession has frozen the once gushing deal flow of private equity, pushing many players to the side. In the first half of 2009 there were just $26 billion in deals, down 88% from the $215 billion in the same time period in 2007, says PitchBook in New York City. With 11 acquisitions so far in 2009, Gores is still very much in the game, sweeping up such ugly ducklings as a maker of electronic wire systems for cars, a vendor of used servers and telecom equipment and a company that provides maintenance and transportation to offshore oil rigs. In May Platinum bought the ailing San Diego Union-Tribune, during a year when newspaper ad revenue is down 30% and several big publishers are in bankruptcy court. \"We don't have a plan to turn the whole newspaper business around,\" says Gores. \"But in San Diego, we have a plan to be successful.\"\n\nSo far the $2.8 billion fund, Platinum Equity Partners Capital II, which closed last year, has returned a negative 27.5% to investors (through June 30). That's not unusual for new funds. The $700 million Fund I, which closed in 2004, claims a net internal rate of return of 62.5%. (It collected no fees; for the second fund it gets 1.75% of assets a year plus 20% of profits.) Gores' approach hasn't changed much in 14 years; it's as if he were always operating in a deep recession. Gores buys broken companies, reorganizes them (sometimes with acquisitions), puts in new management and, eventually, sells them off. He personally bets alongside his investors and his firm, putting up an estimated $200 million in the first fund and $300 million so far in the second. His net worth: $2.2 billion.\n\nIt's a long way from working in his father's grocery stores in Flint, Mich. His family emigrated from Israel. Tom, the fifth of sixth children, hustled his way through Michigan State working as a janitor and telemarketer. After a short stint at Continental Telephone (where he met his future wife, Holly), Gores helped found a lumber-logistics software firm with his older brother Alec (currently the billionaire head of rival buyout firm the Gores Group LLC). In 1989 Tom and Holly drove to Los Angeles in a used Cadillac to run West Coast operations. Gores lost big at the blackjack tables in Las Vegas. Near the California border he stopped at a casino for one last game--and won $4,500.\n\nHe wasn't quite as lucky with the software company that handled billing and inventory for lumber outfits. The brothers sold it at a loss. But they learned a lot about salesmanship, distribution and customer service. Another key lesson: buy existing companies backed with real assets. As they worked side by side on a number of deals, the pair began butting heads. Alec says he became angry and depressed over their split in 1995; after that they sometimes competed for the same acquisitions. They've since patched up their differences. But a friendly rivalry persists. \"Tommy took what I did and raised the bar to a whole new level,\" says Alec. \"Of course, I'm watching--and then I move the bar for him.\"\n\nTom launched Platinum Equity out of his small Sherman Oaks home, writing out business plans on the ottoman in his living room. He cold-called business development offices looking for divisions up for sale. That's how he found his first prospect--LSI, which generated computer graphics to re-create accidents for courtroom testimony--in 1996. Despite having good software, the company was gushing red ink as it tried to go national: Corporate offices in Chicago were out of touch with legal clients across the country; programs, often redundant, were getting written everywhere there were customers. Gores cobbled together $200,000 of savings and credit card debt and turned LSI upside down, redistributing management across the field offices and consolidating software writing to one site in Los Angeles. He focused on existing customers and stopped hunting for new ones. Once it stabilized Gores began selling branches. Within six months LSI was off his books, and he was $5 million or so richer.\n\nOver the next five years, between July 1996 and September 2001, Gores' wholly owned fund (Platinum Equity LLC) made 32 acquisitions and realized $940 million on investments that totaled $226 million. These included plunges into call centers (Foresight Software), networking gear ( Racal Electronics ) and voice and data service (Williams Communications).\n\nPerhaps nothing typified Gores' moxie better than his furious attempt to grab Pilot Software (now a unit of SAP) from Dun & Bradstreet . Over a frantic weekend in May 1997 Gores scrambled to put a fresh gloss on his threadbare offices as he learned that a group of Pilot executives would fly out from Boston for a meeting that Monday. \"We thought, 'Who the hell are these guys in suits from L.A.?'\" recalls Philip Norment, who worked for Pilot at the time and is now a Platinum partner. \"We went out to see if these guys were real.\"\n\nGores knew his cramped eight-person Encino, Calif. headquarters wouldn't cut it; they shared the building with a doctor's office and a gym. He quickly sublet a corner lair in a sparkling Century City office tower, rented furniture and recruited his wife and other employees' spouses to mind phones, pour coffee and pad the thin personnel roster. According to company lore, they slapped a freshly made \"Platinum Equity\" sign on the door just as the d&b group entered the lobby. Gores closed the deal that August.\n\nSpecial Offer: Free Trial Issue of Forbes\n\nTen years later Gores has 100-plus transactions behind him. \"We have a lot of very capable people, but if you make it bureaucratic, you're not going to be fast,\" he says. \"If we lose speed, we become more of a commodity.\" Still, Gores casts a wide net looking for acquisitions, employing 15 associates to scour for deals. His database manages contact information on 140,000 corporate executives, investment bankers, financial brokers and anyone else who might provide a lead. In a typical year Platinum looks at 1,200 possible deals, researches half and pulls the trigger on perhaps 20. At any moment Gores is running a portfolio of 20 to 30 companies.\n\nThree years ago it bought U.S. steel wholesaler PNA Steel from TUI AG, a German tourism company. Feralloy, one of PNA's three units, was burning through cash, thanks in part to inefficient management. The various units were also fighting over the same customers. Thirty PNA executives attended a presentation arranged by Merrill Lynch to introduce the company. This set off Gores' operational radar: If it took that many people to explain the business, Platinum could probably thin out and refocus operations.\n\nWith no prior experience in the industry, Platinum analysts plunged into the world of steel for a month, grilling general managers of every distribution center about how they won and why they lost customers, where the bottlenecks lay, how steel prices moved. Gores' mergers and acquisitions gang formed a plan to dominate the construction-beam industry and plotted three additional acquisitions that could help them get there.\n\nGores modeled the deal to absorb a theoretical 25% crash in steel prices the day after they took over. \"Our analysis was based on [the assumption that] if the worst happens, can we survive,\" he says. He bought PNA for less than the book value of its assets.\n\nPlatinum slashed executive ranks and distribution centers, redirected sales efforts, hired industry veteran Maurice (Sandy) Nelson Jr. to unite the three warring divisions and made three key acquisitions. Within nine months PNA was the biggest distributor of steel beams in the U.S. In a highly leveraged deal, Platinum put up $19 million. Two years later it sold the company to Reliance Steel & Aluminum for $1.1 billion. Platinum's net proceeds amounted to $512 million.\n\nIn July Gores lost his bid for bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi . Platinum had spent three years on the deal, getting government approval to offer $3.6 billion, including $2.5 billion in financing from gm, in a salvage plan. But creditors, complaining they weren't getting a fair shake, persuaded the bankruptcy judge to open the bidding. The lenders won, agreeing to forgive $3.4 billion in Delphi debt, plus offering an additional $750 million in new financing. \"It's a tough subject,\" says Gores, who claims that the group of lenders hijacked his plan. \"We could've created a huge ruckus, but we were gentlemen.\"\n\nGores has his hands full with the San Diego Union-Tribune, which he bought in May for an estimated $30 million, based on current industry multiples. Three days after the deal closed, Platinum laid off 192 people; 112 additional cuts came in August. Gores saw no other way: The newspaper (average daily circulation: 300,000) had less than $10 million in Ebitda last year on revenue of $225 million, down from $100 million on revenue of roughly $360 million in 2005. \"The outlook was for an unprofitable 2009,\" says a Platinum spokesman.\n\nWhat makes Gores think he can revive a near-dead enterprise? He likes the market. San Diego is still relatively affluent and culturally conservative; few denizens read the Los Angeles Times. He also prizes the assets--a 500,000-square-foot headquarters and warehouse in Mission Valley, plus 50,000 square feet of offices in La Jolla, San Marcos and Carlsbad.\n\nBut, oh, the challenges. The U-T was perhaps the last paper in the U.S. that relied on cut-and-paste layouts; Platinum has spent several million dollars on new publication software. To replace the loss of national advertisers, especially retailers and real estate firms, and classifieds, the paper is refocusing on small businesses. Gores has also updated the Web site with more social media, blogs and podcasts. He has reinstated 401(k) matching and reversed pay cuts by the previous owners, the Copley family. He expects a slight operating profit this year.\n\nGores plans to buy more distressed media companies. Lately his name has surfaced among potential buyers of the Boston Globe and BusinessWeek. Platinum's response: \"Don't believe everything you read in the papers.\""
