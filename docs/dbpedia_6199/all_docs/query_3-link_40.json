        "text": "The Detroit Pistons are on one of the NBA’s epic losing streaks. That’s not a familiar situation for owner Tom Gores.\n\nAfter Tuesday night’s loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the Pistons’ 27th straight, they are just a Thursday night loss to the Celtics in Boston from tying the NBA’s longest losing streak. The longest losing streak in one season had been 26, held by the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers. The overall record of 28 consecutive losses is held by the 76ers, who started the quest in the 2014-15 season and carried it into the following year. The 2-28 Pistons’ current winning percentage of 0.067 has the franchise on track to truly earn the title as the bad boys of basketball. The reigning worst team ever is the 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats, who clawed to a 7-59 finish in a lockout-shortened season.\n\nThat Bobcat season also happens to be the first full season Gores owned the Pistons. Over his time owning the franchise, the Pistons have the worst winning percentage in the league, a pallid 0.368, just edging out the Orlando Magic at 0.372.\n\nAs the Pistons fell to 2-28 on the year, the crowd chanted, “Sell the team! Sell the team!” in a statement to Gores, according to AP.\n\nBy contrast, Gores’ record with his other business is one of consistent winning. The billionaire, with a $9.1 billion net worth according to Forbes, made his fortune in private equity. Gores formed his firm Platinum Equity Capital in 1995. Specializing in mergers and acquisitions where it takes an active hand operating the businesses it buys, Platinum Equity has $47 billion in assets under management today, making it one of the largest private equity firms in the world. The business has investments in publisher McGraw-Hill, tech firm Ingram Micro and consumer brand conglomerate SVP Worldwide, which produces Viking stoves, Singer sewing machines and Husqvarna hedge trimmers, among other products.\n\nIn the league of private equity firms, Gores is one of the top-ranked. Five of Platinum Equity’s six long-lived funds have easily outperformed peers, while the outlier has performed just below average, according to data from Preqin, which specializes in performance data of private equity firms. Five of the Gores funds are in the top quartile of performers, with internal rates of return (a complex figure that takes into account cash flow to and from the fund by year) in the mid-to-high 20s, compared to the average mid-to-high teens of peers. More simply, based on net multiple return on investment compiled by Preqin, the typical Gores fund nearly triples investor money over its lifetime. The best fund: the Platinum Equity I fund that launched in 2004, which has since returned all the money to investors. An investment of $1 million got investors $3.63 million in return.\n\nNot everything makes money. The Platinum Equity Partners VI fund, launched last year, has lost value, according to Preqin, which shows a net return of 0.96–that is, $100 invested are now worth $96. Could the Pistons’ misfortune have affected Gores’ other business? Probably not: The fund is still raising money, and private equity funds are designed to produce returns over a period of years, rather than one. A spokesman for Platinum Equity declined to comment. There is still time for fund VI to return to winning ways, much like the Pistons, theoretically, could end up with a winning record with 52 games still to play in the season.\n\nBut even if the Pistons continue to misfire their way to NBA ignominy, there’s another bright spot for the owner. Gores purchased the Pistons in 2011 for $325 million. The franchise is now worth $3.1 billion, according to the latest Sportico NBA valuations. At an 854% return on investment, the Pistons are probably the billionaire’s best investment of all.\n\nWith assistance from Lev Akabas"
