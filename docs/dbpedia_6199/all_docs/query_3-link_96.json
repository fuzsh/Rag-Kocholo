        "text": "Tom Gores: Right now the Palace is our home, and I’m excited about that. You know how it is; you got to take care of your home. It’s really doing a service and my whole focus — all of our Palace team, everybody — is how do we get this franchise back to the top. I’m also excited about what also is going on in Detroit. There’s really great stuff going on downtown. I spoke to (Quicken Loans founder and Cavs owner) Dan Gilbert a few weeks ago and he has some great stuff going on down there. I’m excited for Detroit, but right now our single biggest job is to get the franchise back to the top and I think if we do that everything will take care of itself. That’s been our focus.\n\nKlay Thompson: “Don’t matter how you shoot the ball that day, f***** feel like s***, you need to get out there every day, stay at it, bro, you’re going to make the most of it yourself,” Thomson said. “That’s all I have to say. Fall in love with this s*** because it does not last forever, fellas. This s*** goes by so quick, and as you get older in your career, you’ll notice guys you came in with it’s tough. It’s just tough to stick. “Enjoy it for as much as you can and love it because, at the end of the day, the money and all that s*** is cool, but the fact that you get to do something you love for a living is not a better feeling. Big time.”\n\nBrian Keefe on Alex Sarr: His ability to see and read the game is what stood out to us\n\nSarr struggled with his shooting on the other end of the floor, but Keefe has seen plenty of flashes of his offensive ability and looks forward to exploring what he believes is a very high ceiling as a two-way player. “He’s got the ability to be a three-level scorer at some point. But one thing that has stood out to us is his ability to see the game and read the game. He’s a good passer, so we want the ball in his hands to explore those opportunities for him to make plays for himself and others,” Keefe said of the 7-footer.\n\nKeefe plans to put Carrington in a variety of situations early on. “We’re going to play a little bit positionless to where a lot of people will handle and make decisions. We look at him as a guard who can make plays for himself and for others. You can see that he’s a multi-talented guy who’s a good rebounder that can push it in transition. We’ll see him handle playing on and off the ball,” Keefe said.\n\nFor the rookies in particular, Keefe says the first order of business will be fairly simple: show them how to work like pros. “Establishing habits, No. 1,” Keefe told Monumental Sports Network. “I said the same last year with Bilal, you teach them the professional habits and how to work in this league. It’s the only way you get better is to have consistent work habits and approach to everything you’re doing. That will be our No. 1 focus for those guys.”"
