        "text": "Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Platinum Equity; Owner, Detroit Pistons\n\nTom Gores is founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of global investment firm Platinum Equity, as well as owner of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nUnder his leadership, Platinum Equity has approximately $23 billion of assets under management and its portfolio comprises approximately 40 operating companies generating more than $25 billion in revenue.\n\nSince acquiring the Detroit Pistons in 2011, Gores returned the franchise to downtown Detroit and opened the Henry Ford Detroit Pistons Performance Center—a state-of-the-art practice facility and corporate headquarters in New Center. Further, Gores added firepower to the team’s front office with the hiring of Troy Weaver and Dwane Casey, who are responsible for acquiring and guiding several powerhouse additions, which include Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Cade Cunningham.\n\nGores remains committed to numerous local charitable organizations, including Grow Detroit’s Young Talent, HAVEN, and FlintNOW, an organization Gores launched in 2016 to support relief and revitalization initiatives in response to the Flint Water Crisis.\n\nGores holds a bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University."
