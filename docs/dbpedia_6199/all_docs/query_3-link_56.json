The ESPN/ABC analyst, who starred at Michigan and played 13 seasons in the NBA, mimics a proud parent while advocating for the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy, which he co-founded in 2011. The passion is also apparent when he brings up JRLA benefactors like the Detroit Pistons, owner Tom Gores and vice chairman Arn Tellem.",
