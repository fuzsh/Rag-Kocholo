        "text": "While the Pistons are in last place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division, team Owner Tom Gores yesterday said that he \"hasn't been discouraged by the slow start to the season.\" In Detroit, Vincent Goodwill Jr. notes Gores' comments come \"despite his usual preseason claims about expecting his team to make the playoffs\" (DETROIT NEWS, 12/16). In Michigan, David Mayo noted Gores \"speaks regularly\" with Pistons coach and Pistons President of Basketball Operations Stan Van Gundy. Gores said that he is \"pleased with the Pistons' vision and direction.\" Gores: \"Maybe it's not going to show on the court every night, but I'm personally so comfortable that he's doing the right things every single day, and eventually, it's going to convert to wins\" (MLIVE.com, 12/15).\n\nMAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN: In DC, Jason Reid wrote Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld's \"surprising comeback has been great\" for the team. The result has been a \"pro hoops renaissance engineered by someone who appeared to be on his way out\" of DC. Fortunately for Grunfeld, \"he has a supportive boss.\" Wizards Owner Ted Leonsis \"showed something rare in professional sports these days: patience.\" Leonsis: “Ernie could have lurched to do things to assuage me or could have tried to do things to make people happy. Instead, he stuck to the plan. ... I’m happy for him, (and) I respect the job he has done\" (WASHINGTON POST, 12/13).\n\nTO THE POLLS: In Atlanta, Chris Vivlamore notes Hawks G Kent Bazemore and F Mike Muscala \"were part of a video created by the team’s marketing department this week to urge fans to vote during now open NBA All-Star balloting.\" The video is \"modeled after a routine by Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake on the Tonight Show where the two have a social media inspired conversation complete with a hashtag hand gesture.\" Bazemore and Muscala \"run down the list of Hawks starters who deserve All-Star consideration,\" and each player \"gets a number of adjectives\" (AJC.com, 12/13)."
