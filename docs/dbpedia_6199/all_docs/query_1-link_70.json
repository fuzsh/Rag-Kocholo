        "text": "GrowthCap is pleased to announce The Top Private Equity Firms of 2023. This year’s nominees underwent a rigorous process to be selected. In addition to evaluating nomination submissions and the research and information we receive on each firm, we paid close attention to what each firm’s real reputation was among CEOs, LPs, and other GPs. We held conversations to discern what firm culture is like, the degree to which a firm helps its portfolio companies, overall firm growth and performance, and commitment to ESG, among other factors. And in some cases, we have known the firms and their key leaders for many years.\n\nFounders and CEOs work tirelessly for much of their lives to build their companies and when it comes time for them to partner with a private equity firm, they deserve to know who they can trust. We received hundreds of nominations and after close examination and deliberation, and after the vast majority of firms were eliminated, the below firms were ultimately deemed to be this year’s best of the best.\n\nThe below list is comprised of the best private equity firms at scaling companies—they are growth focused. They represent various segments of the market from large cap to middle market to emerging growth and they are either multi-sector or focused on a single sector such as software or technology. Many of the firms are long-standing pillars of the private equity industry while others have been scaling rapidly over the past one to two decades or have chosen to stay specialized in their particular market niche.\n\nPlease join us in recognizing The Top Private Equity Firms of 2023.\n\nH.I.G. Growth Partners is the dedicated growth capital affiliate of H.I.G. Capital, a global alternative investment firm founded in 1993 with $58 billion of equity capital under management. Focusing on the small-cap and mid-cap segments of the market, H.I.G. Growth invests in growing, technology-oriented businesses across sectors including SaaS, cloud & data software, technology, media & telecommunications, fintech, healthcare, and technology-enabled services. The firm makes both majority and minority investments throughout North America, Europe and Latin America.\n\nH.I.G. Growth leverages the resources of its parent organization, including over 500 investment professionals, 19 office locations, and over 100 active portfolio companies. Its extensive network and resources include a portfolio operating team that creates value in partnership with portfolio companies, accelerating their growth in areas including talent, go-to-market, digital transformation, and FP&A. The firm values a collaborative, inclusive culture focused on mutual respect, curiosity, and partnership which is evidenced by strong relationships across the firm and portfolio organizations.
