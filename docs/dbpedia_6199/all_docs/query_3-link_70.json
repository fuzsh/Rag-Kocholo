        "text": "FLINT, Michigan —\n\nThirty years ago, Jim Masserang and Jeff Powell knew there was something special about\n\nTom Gores\n\n.\n\nBut neither had any idea the former Genesee High student would go on to become one of richest men in America who is reportedly on the verge of becoming owner of the Detroit Pistons.\n\n“I'd liked to be able to say that, but not really,” said a chucking Masserang, who was Gores' football and basketball coach at Genesee. “I'm not that smart to pick up on something like that. That's pretty unique.”\n\nGores, who graduated from Genesee in 1982, could become the owner of the Pistons as early as this week according to published reports. The NBA club would be the latest addition to an empire that has Gores ranked at No. 153 on Forbes Magazine's list of America's 400 Richest Americans with a net worth of $2.4 billion.\n\nHe's the owner of Platinum Equity, a Los Angeles-based firm specializing in acquisitions and mergers that owns more than 30 other properties and is ranked No. 31 on Forbes list of America's top 100 Private Companies.\n\n“It is hard to believe,” said Powell, a Davison computer project manager who has known the 46-year-old Gores since they played little league baseball together almost 40 years ago. “But if you think back to years ago, you knew there was something different about him, that he was going to be successful.\n\n“If you look at all three of the brothers — Sam, Alec and Tom — there was something about them.”\n\nAlec Gores is the owner of Gores Group — which also specializes in mergers and acquisitions — and Forbes has pegged his net worth at $1.6 billion. He has offices in the United States and Europe.\n\nSam Gores is the owner of the talent agency Paradigm. AskMen.com ranked him No. 8 on its list of Hollywood's top agents and his clients include Academy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, TV stars Neil Patrick Harris and Katherine Heigel, and the band Aerosmith.\n\nAnd to think the brothers hail from Genesee Township, the tiny community northeast of Flint that has a population of 24,124.\n\n“You have to come from somewhere,” Powell said with a laugh. “It's is pretty remarkable they come from Genesee.”\n\nLike his brothers, Tom Gores was born in Israel before the family moved to the Flint area when he was 5 years old.\n\nWhile a student at Genesee High School, Gores played football and basketball under Masserang. He was a defensive back and kicker in football while playing guard in basketball.\n\n“He was a very good student, a very good athlete,” said Masserang, who was also Gores' physical education instructor. “He was a good player. He was very respectful. He had a lot of self confidence, just a real good kid to coach and teach.”\n\nOn the baseball field, Gores was a middle infielder who had a highly competitive nature according to Powell, who said he first began playing baseball with Gores when they were both 8.\n\n“He loved sports,” said Powell, who last saw Gores when they had dinner in Detroit a few years ago. “He was very, very competitive. He was a winner even way back then. He never wanted to lose. He and I would play one-on-one basketball before practice and he always wanted to beat me.\n\n“I know he still plays one-on-one basketball with his friends and wants to win. He never wants to lose.”\n\nWhat was Gores like off the field back in high school?\n\n“He pretty much kept to himself,” Powell said. “It was when he'd get alone with more close friends that he'd really start opening up. When there were a bunch of people, he was quiet. He was always thinking. He was always thinking of something.”\n\nGores' first job was working as a stock boy at Tom's Market in Genesee, an establishment that was owned by his uncle, longtime Flint-area business Tom Joubran. In 2002, Tom and Alec Gores donated $250,000 to Genesee High in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nThese days, Gores has been described as a “buyout king.”\n\nPlatinum Equity, which Gores founded in 1995, specializes in purchasing companies and restructuring them. A Detroit News report said Gores has a reputation for not paying too generously to acquire properties and for walking away from more deals than he makes.\n\nOne of the companies he passed on was apparently auto parts supplier Delphi, which Gores reportedly tried to purchase in 2007 for $560 million.\n\nNow, he has his sights set on the Pistons. But true to form, Gores hasn't said much publicly about trying to acquire the three-time NBA champion.\n\nHe attended last Tuesday's game against the the Los Angeles Lakers at The Palace and declined comment although the Detroit Free Press did quote him as saying \"I can tell you that I'm a big fan and would I love to own the team? Absolutely.\"\n\nA Platinum Equity spokesman also wouldn't comment on Gores reported interest in the Pistons.\n\n“We don't discuss whether or not we're considering prospective acquisitions and we don't comment on market rumors,” said Mark Barnhill, head of Platinum Equity's investor and media relations department.\n\nA Detroit News report Friday said Gores has entered into an exclusive 30-day negotiating period and is \"presumed to be the bidder who will emerge as the owner\" of the Pistons.\n\nA graduate of Michigan State, Gores lives in Beverly Hills with his wife and three children."
