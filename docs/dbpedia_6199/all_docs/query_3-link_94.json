        "text": "FLINT, Michigan —\n\nJohn Pintek remembers being shocked to see two of his former math students at Genesee High School, Tom and Alec Gores, show up on the Fortune 500 list a few years ago.\n\n“I’m like, ‘You’re kidding. That’s amazing,’” Pintek recalls. “You think about when those guys were in school and who would think it?”\n\nThe reaction was natural. Most people didn’t know billionaire business tycoons during their humble beginnings, especially in small schools like Genesee.\n\nAfter some reflection, however, it all made sense to Pintek.\n\n“In retrospect, with that kind of work ethic, you can see where that panned out,” Pintek said.\n\n“They came from a really good family. They’re all just super kids to be around and will do anything you ask, no question. They just had that work ethic that I believe came from home that they were going to do it and do it right now, not do it wrong then it get right the second time.”\n\nOne of those hard-working brothers, Tom, is closer to becoming the new owner of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nTom Gores, a 1982 Genesee graduate who has amassed a fortune estimated at $2.4 billion, has reached an agreement to buy the Pistons, Palace Sports and Entertainment, DTE Energy Music Theatre and operating rights to Meadow Brook Music Festival. The agreement is subject to approval by the NBA's Board of Governors, which meets Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe agreement ends more than six months of negotiations to purchase the Pistons and their related properties.\n\n“It’s kind of funny,” said Mike Ribant, a teacher and coach at Genesee. “The kids are thinking they’ll be able to get some free tickets now. It gives us something to have pride in, that a kid from a small school makes good.”\n\nGores founded Los Angeles-based Platinum Equity, which specializes in acquisitions and mergers. He owns 30 other companies. Platinum Equity ranks 31st on Forbes Magazine's list of America's top 100 private companies. Forbes lists Goes No. 153 on its list of wealthiest Americans.\n\n“He’s been an ambitious fellow from the day he was born,” said his uncle Tom Joubran, who hired Gores as a stock boy at the age of 10 at Tom’s Market in Flint. “He worked for me. He was a dynamic kid. Now he has businesses all over, not just in the United States, and has thousands and thousands of people working for him.”\n\nSports played a key role during Gores’ formative years. He played football, basketball and baseball at Genesee, displaying qualities in the arena of competition that would serve him well in the business world.\n\n“He was the kind of kid you wanted to have around,” said Tim Weeks, an assistant baseball coach at the time. “He was a positive influence on others. He showed leadership qualities at that age even.”\n\nOf course, a young man who would eventually conquer the business world hated to lose in sports.\n\n“He liked to have a good time and brought a lot of levity to the team,” said Pintek, who was an assistant football coach when Gores played. “He was pretty serious about winning, too. He had this real strong desire to win.”\n\nWhen Gores looked for a way to support his alma mater and honor the 50th wedding anniversary of his uncle and aunt, Tom and Julia Joubran, in 2002, he and Alec donated $250,000 for the purchase of an all-weather track at Genesee. Ribant said the school would not have been able to afford a new track on its own.\n\n“We had an old cinder track and never had home track meets,” Ribant said. “Since then, the track is beautiful and the program has turned around. We won our league the last two years and three times out of the last five. It’s a huge plus, that’s for sure. It couldn’t have been done without them.”\n\nThe theme of small-town pride rings through whenever folks from Genesee talk about Gore’s rise to prominence.\n\n“We used to have an expression that good things come in small packages,” Weeks said. “We’re the smallest public school in Genesee County. It’s just another example of a successful person coming out of that community. As a coach, I see how athletics serves a major role in that capacity. It’s kind of a hidden curriculum, a classroom away from the classroom. A lot of lessons are learned there.”"
