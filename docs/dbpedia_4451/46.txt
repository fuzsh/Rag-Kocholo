I recently visited the Shin-Keisei line for the first time in two years. What's new with this local railway?

Let me quickly review the Shin-Keisei line to start. Shin-Keisei (New Keisei) is a private railway company in Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo. It's an affiliate firm of Keisei Electric Railway Company. Connecting Matsudo on the JR East Joban line and Tsudanuma on the Keisei main line, there are 24 stations over a total operating length of 26.5 kilometers. The track gauge is 1,435 millimeters and the electric system is 1,500V DC overhead. The Shin-Keisei line had a unique history in early times. It was constructed as a training line by the Railway Regiment of the ex-Japanese Army in 1929. After WWII, the track was sold to Keisei Electric Railway Company, and reopened as the Shin-Keisei line in 1947.
