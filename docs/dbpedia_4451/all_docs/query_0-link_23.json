        "text": "Tokyo has two main airports: Narita and Haneda. While Haneda is more convenient due to its proximity to the city centre, many international flights and most discount airlines tend to be serviced out ofNarita Airport. The good news is that with recent additions such as a brand newgourmet food court to the Terminal 2 international departure zone, Narita is now even more enticing to fly out of.\n\nNarita is located in Chiba prefecture, roughly 60 kilometres from central Tokyo, so you need to give yourself ample time to get to and from the airport. The most common and economical modes of transport are train or bus. Taking a taxi is possible, but it’ll cost you an arm and a leg for just a one-way journey (easily upwards of ¥20,000), so we really don’t recommend hailing a cab if you can avoid it.\n\nWhen catching a flight from Narita, it’s a good idea to find out which terminal you are flying out of ahead of arrival. Narita Airport has three main terminals: Terminal 1 and 2 mainly service international flights while Terminal 3 operates domestic flights (though there are exceptions). Terminals 2 and 3 are fairly close together. Terminal 1, however, is not as easy to access – you’ll need to take a shuttle bus or train to get to this terminal from the other two.\n\nTo help you plan your journey, we’ve compiled a list of the seven best ways to travel between Tokyo and Narita Airport."
