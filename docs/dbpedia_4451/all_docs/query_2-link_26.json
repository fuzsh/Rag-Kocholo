However, mastering the train system will make your life much more convenient.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAbout Trains in Chiba\n\nRiding the Train\n\nIC Cards\n\nEtiquette\n\nMap of Train Lines in Chiba Prefecture\n\nJR East Japan\n\nKeisei\n\nOther Train Companies\n\nPeople Movers\n\nRegional Information\n\nBlock 5\n\nBlock 6\n\nBlock 7\n\nBlock 8\n\nHow to Look up Train Times\n\nHow to Look up Train Times using Hyperdia.com\n\nHow to Check for Train Delays\n\nAbout Trains in Chiba\n\nTrain lines in Japan are managed by companies, which you can identify by the name of the line. The biggest train company is Japan Railways (JR); but in Chiba and Tokyo, you will see other train lines, such as Tokyo Metro, Keisei, etc. Within each company group, there are often several lines that you can easily transfer to without having to pay separately for each line. Each company sets its own rates and times, and some lines are more expensive than others. Bear in mind that trains stop running at night (anywhere between 10 pm and 1 am, depending on the train line), so make sure you always check when your last train home is (終電 shūden or 最終 saishū) before going out!\n\nReturn to Top\n\nRiding the Train\n\nThe three names or pieces of information to remember when using a train:\n\nYour destination station: 駅 (eki)\n\nThe line(s) you will need to use to get there: 線 (sen)\n\nThe last station the train is bound for: 行き (yuki)\n\nNOTE: This will be listed on signs in the station so you know which platform to use for the direction you are going.\n\nFor the most part, all stations in Chiba are clearly marked in English and Japanese, with signs that will guide you through a station when transferring lines. Many train lines in Chiba, especially near Tokyo, announce or display the next stop, final station, and transfer lines in both English and Japanese.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nIC Cards\n\nIf you ride the train frequently or plan to visit Tokyo, it is very convenient to get an IC card, such as Suica or PASMO. You can charge your card with cash at the train station, then touch your card at the ticket gate. This saves you from having to buy a ticket every time you change lines. IC cards can be bought at machines (with a deposit) at most major stations. Ask a station attendant if you require assistance. Keep in mind that some local private lines may not accept IC cards.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nEtiquette\n\nOnce on board the train, the general etiquette is to keep your voice low and your belongings stored at your feet or on the rack above your head. You should give up priority seats for passengers that need it. Sitting on the floor or lying across multiple seats is not allowed. Eating and drinking is allowed, but be sure to properly dispose of your trash.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMap of Trains in Chiba Prefecture\n\nReturn to Top\n\nThe below links are connected to the corresponding Wikipedia page.\n\nJR East Japan\n\nSōbu Main Line(総武本線 Sōbu honsen): Runs from Chiba Station to Chōshi Station.\n\nChūō-Sōbu Line (中央総武緩行線 Chūō Sōbu kankō-sen): Runs from Chiba Station to Mitaka Station (Tokyo).

In Japanese, the apps are called 乗換案内 (norikae annai).\n\nHyperdia (English/Japanese): iPhone / Android\n\nYahoo! Japan (Japanese only): iPhone / Android\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow to Look up Train Times Using Hyperdia.com\n\nLet’s use the English version of Hyperdia.com to go from Togane to Soga.\n\nType in your starting and ending points. It will automatically choose the current time, but you can also set it to what time you want to arrive by. Be careful with hyphenated station names and long o’s.\n\nGreat, there’s a Togane Line train that goes straight there! Take note of the time it will take, the cost, and of course the time the train leaves. Don’t trust the computer too much…\n\nRoute 2 sends you on a route that takes twice as long, and Route 4 sends you on an express that costs a lot more. Sometimes Hyperdia and other train checkers get creative, so don’t trust them too blindly. Plan your trip in advance so you can take the best way there.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nHow to Check for Train Delays\n\nMain Page: How to Check for Train Delays\n\nTrain lines may be delayed due to weather, safety checks, passenger injury, or a number of other reasons. Delays will be announced on TV, on train apps, and on certain websites.\n\nFor all Kanto area lines: JR East English page\n\nFor Tokyo train lines: Is it delayed.com\n\nIf you use a Japanese train app like Jorudan, Navitime or Yahoo! Japan’s 路線情報 (rosenjōhō), delays will be announced next to a warning (!) icon. Some helpful Japanese words are listed below:\n\n運行情報 unkō jōhō service information 運行状況 unkō jōkyō service status （列車）遅延 (ressha) chien (train) delay 運転見合わせ unten miawase service stopped and will resume as soon as possible 運休 unkyū service is stopped or cancelled indefinitely 運転再開 unten saikai service resumed 平常運転 heijō unten trains are running normally 人身事故 jinshin jiko passenger injury 台風の影響で taifū no eikyō de due to the typhoon\n\nCheck here for more useful disaster-related vocabulary in Japanese."
