        "text": "Trains in Japan: First-Timer’s Guide to Japan’s Rail Network\n\nTrains in Japan and How to Travel Japan’s Rail Network\n\nBrimming with amazing eats, iconic landmarks, sensational views and (so much) more, a trip to Japan promises a life-changing experience and an abundance of adventures. If it’s your first time in Japan, you might be a little worried about how to travel around Japan (especially if you don’t speak Japanese). Fret not, we are here with a first-timer’s guide on how to get around Japan by train!\n\n🚨Important Klook Tip🚨: Prices for the Whole Japan JR Pass and many JR Regional Passes have increased since 1 October 2023. Beat the price hike by booking single-journey Shinkansen and Limited Express train tickets now on Klook!\n\nBefore we begin, here’s a quick #KlookTip - Download the app Japan Travel by Navitime! If you plan to travel a lot via trains and buses, this app will give you the best route recommendations. You can also select which JR Pass you have for it to show you options that are covered by your pass. [Apple Store | Google Play]\n\nHow to Use Trains in Japan\n\nJapan is renowned for its extremely efficient train network, and with multiple lines connecting various cities and neighborhoods together, it can understandably get quite confusing. Let us untangle that a bit for you!\n\nFirstly, it’s important to note that the railway lines in Japan are not operated by a single company. To put it simply, JR aka Japan Railways Group is the main railway network in Japan — it owns about 80% of the country’s railroads (where your JR Pass comes in). The remaining 20% is served by dozens of other private railway companies, especially in and around metropolitan areas.\n\nTypes of Trains in Japan\n\nNext, there are different types of trains in Japan. Different trains suit different needs — for example the bullet train is the fastest transportation between cities and stops at major city stations (eg. Tokyo Station to Shin Osaka Station). If you’re planning to explore a certain area in a particular city instead, you can hop onboard a local train which stops at every station.\n\nHere’s a quick summary of the various types of trains in Japan:\n\nJapan Train Ticket Types\n\nSince there are various trains in Japan, you would need to buy different train tickets depending on what kind of train you are looking to take.\n\nHere’s a quick overview on what’s available:\n\nIntroduction to Traveling on Japan Railways (JR)\n\nFirstly, you would’ve probably heard the benefits of getting a JR Pass for your Japan travels - but what is a JR pass and how does it help exactly?\n\nTo put it simply, the Whole Japan JR Pass:\n\n✔️ Allows tourists unlimited travel on all Japan Railways Group (JR) Shinkansen, trains, buses, and ferry services across the country\n\n✔️ Is available in 7, 14, or 21-day validity depending on the duration of your trip\n\n✔️ Price starts from USD 206.95 for 7-day pass\n\n✔️ Is best if you plan to explore many different cities in Japan\n\nThere are also Regional JR Passes, that offer:\n\n✔️ Unlimited travel on all Japan Railways Group (JR) transportation — different passes cover different types of transport (trains, buses, ferry etc.) in a specific area or region; Check what’s included in your pass before you purchase!\n\n✔️ Depending on the pass, different durations and flexible days are available\n\n✔️ Price depends on location selected\n\n✔️ Is best if you only have plans to explore a specific area or specific cities as you can save more money on a regional pass rather than a Whole Japan pass\n\nFor more details on what a JR Pass covers, how much, and which pass you should get, check out this guide:\n\nBeyond JR: Privately-Owned Rail Companies\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are other privately-owned rail companies in Japan. Private railways often handle intercity travel, airport connections, and particular regional destinations not covered by the Japan Rail Pass. These companies often also operate local bus networks, hotels, and attractions.\n\nIf you intend to explore a certain area in Japan instead of traveling from city to city, most transportation companies also offer special city passes that are great for your adventures! We’ll share more about the popular ones for tourists (according to the city) in greater detail below!\n\nYou can discover, book, and experience the best things to do including attractions, activities, car rentals, SIM cards, and more on Klook.

For Tokyo, the major lines are:\n\nJR\n\nTokyo Metro\n\nToei Lines\n\nOther lines serving Greater Tokyo\n\nFrom the Airport\n\nNarita Airport\n\n🚝 Keisei Main Line or JR Narita Express\n\nKeisei Main Line\n\nNarita International Airport is the main airport for Tokyo. Here you can take the Keisei Skyliner on the Keisei Main Linethat will get you to Tokyo’s Keisei-Ueno station.
