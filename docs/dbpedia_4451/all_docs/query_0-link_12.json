        "text": "Keisei Electric Railway Company\n\nKeisei is one of the nine major private railway companies in the Kanto region of Japan and mainly operates in Tokyo and Chiba prefecture. It is also one of the private railways that connects Tokyo with Narita International Airport.\n\nThe company was established in 1903 as a merger between three companies to build a railroad that would connect Tokyo with Narita to carry people to the Naritasan Shinshoji Temple. The first section of Oshiage through Shibamata was opened in 1912. In 1960, Keisei connected with the Toei Subway Asakusa Line which would also connect with the Keikyu Main Line. All three of these lines use standard gauge (1435mm) rails.\n\nIn 1978, Keisei began operating the Sky Liner, an airport access limited express. This train originally connected Ueno and Narita Airport but the Narita Airport Station was not actually located inside the airport. No trains ran directly inside the airport terminal until 1991.\n\nAs of 2010, the main airport access line has switched from the Keisei Main Line to the Narita SKY ACCESS Line which connects the same two stations, but through a different route. This line can handle speeds of up to 160km/h, making it one of the fastest private lines in all of Japan."
