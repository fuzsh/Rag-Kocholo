        "text": "Tokyo has one of the most efficient and fast public transport systems in the world. It combines an extensive train network, underground subway lines, a bus system, taxis, and car rentals. For visitors, trains and subways are usually the most convenient way to travel. All stations have signs in English and trains and subways are faster and cheaper than buses. The bus system is more complicated as well and destinations are written only in Japanese. The drivers, too, do not speak English. Taxis are very expensive and drivers speak little or no English. Driving yourself is not advised as heavy traffic congestion tends to make driving slow and frustrating.\n\nTrain and Subway Lines\n\nTrains and subways are the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo. JR East ( East Japan Railway Company ) is the biggest operator of railway passenger lines in the city. It is also the largest passenger railway company in the world. Besides the Shinkansen (bullet trains) and the Monorail , the most prominent line of JR East is the JR Yamanote Line, a circle line which connects Tokyo's multiple city centers. Its six major stations are Tokyo, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya and Shinagawa. The other JR East commuter lines that radiate from Tokyo to its suburbs are the Keihin-Tohoku , Chuo , Sobu , Keiyo , Yokohama , Tokaido , and Yokosuka Lines.\n\nThere are several other private railway networks that also operate in Tokyo. Among these are Keikyu with 5 lines, Keio with 6 lines, Keisei with 7 lines, Odakyu with 3 lines, Seibu with 13 lines, Tobu with 12 lines, Tokyu with 8, and the last 5 one each for a total of 55 non-JR lines serving Tokyo Prefecture.\n\nThe Tokyo subway network has a total of 13 lines operated by two companies  the Tokyo Metro and Toei (Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation). Tokyo Metro operates 9 lines  Ginza (Shibuya to Asakusa), Marunouchi (Ogikubo to Ikebukuro), Hibiya (Naka-meguro to Kita-senju), Tozai (Nakano to Nishi-funabashi), Chiyoda (Yoyogi-uehara to Kita-ayase), Yurakucho (Wakoshi to Shin-kiba), Hanzomon (Shibiya to Oshiage), Namboku (Meguro to Akabane-iwabuchi), and Fukutoshin (Ikebukuro to Shibuya). The busiest Tokyo Metro stations are Ikebukuro, Kita-senju, Otemachi, and Ginza. Toei operates 4 lines - Toei Asakusa (Nishi-magome to Oshiage), Toei Mita (Shirokane-takanawa to Nishi-takashimadaira & Meguro to Shirokane-takanawa), Toei Shinjuku (Shinjuku to Moto-yawata), and Toei Oedo (radiate part  Hikarigaoka to Tochomae & circle part  Tochomae to Tochomae via Roppongi and Ryogoku).\n\nTickets cost begins at 130 yen for the JR lines, 160 yen for the Tokyo Metro lines, and 190 yen for the Toei lines. Above the ticket machines there is a train map that shows the train routes and the ticket fares. Each train company has different tickets, and tickets of one company cannot be used for another. A Passnet can be bought for 1000, 3000, or 5000 yen which can be used on the Tokyo Metro, Toei and other private lines, but not on JR lines. JR has its own rechargeable card system, called Suica . A Suica does not need to be passed through the ticket gates, but just held above it, which makes it faster. It can also be re-charged for the desired amount at a ticket machine. Some special day passes are also available which are valid for unlimited use on particular lines on one calendar day.\n\nBuses\n\nBuses are secondary to trains and subway lines as a means of public transport in Tokyo. They are mainly used in areas that are poorly served by trains or subways, for long distance services, and for airport to city transfers. Toei ( Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation ) operates buses in all the 23 wards of Tokyo and have a fixed fare of 200 yen per ride. Other private bus companies (mostly the large train operators like Yokohama and Kawasaki ) operate on different routes and charge according to distance. Frequent bus riders may buy prepaid bus cards from the drivers to avoid the hassle of buying a ticket each time they ride. These cards are available in 1000, 2000, and 5000 yen denominations. Water buses are also available in the oceanfront area. Visitors to Tokyo often opt for a ride on one of these to get a look at the city from a different angle. Water buses are run by two companies  Tokyo Cruise Ship and Tokyo Mizube Line.\n\nTaxis\n\nTaxis are another mode of transport in Tokyo. These are mainly used by businessmen, when buses are inconvenient, or when people travel in groups. Taxis are relatively more expensive with a ride at 660 yen and costing at least 5000 yen for an average ride. The amount to be paid is as indicated by the fare meter upon arrival at the destination. Most of the taxis are medium sized. There are also some small-sized taxis which are a little cheaper and may be got from one of their exclusive depots. Share-taxis, or noriai taxis as they are called, are also available. Customers who travel to the same destination share the ride, thus paying less than they would do when riding alone. Wagon taxis, or mini-vans, are convenient for visitors with luggage. These are available at the airports and hotels at the same rate as a medium-sized taxi. Limousines are the best taxis. They are larger in size and of a better grade and more expensive.\n\nRental cars"
