        "text": "In Seoul, they wouldn’t need to build new lines if they can fit express trains into existing rail lines.\n\nAs for the Keiyo-Shinjuku extension, it was first proposed in the 1970s and with plan being made in 1980s. It was when Japanese economy still growing rapidly, population influx into Tokyo at very high rate, and when the rail network was still nationally operated under JNR, with the plan for Narita Shinkansen still haven’t dead yet. Which are all massively different from the Tokyo rail network we know nowadays.\n\nHowever, this line continue to survive in following planning documents for railways in Tokyo. Japanese national government form rail plan for metropolitan area every 15 years, with the line first appearing in year 1985’s plan, then in year 2000’s plan the line was ranked with importance of “A2”, aka “It’s appropriate to prepare for the construction of such line in the next 15 years”\n\nThen in the year 2015 plan, it no longer gave rank to different projects, however the national government analysis claim extending Keiyo line to Mitaka will have a Benefit/Cost ratio of 1.4-1.6, and an EIRR of 6.3%-7.1%. In addition to quadruple-tracking Chuo Line Mitaka to Tachikawa segment, which will have a Benefit/Cost ratio of 1.7-1.8, and an EIRR of 7.9%-8.4%. However, extending Keiyo line to Mitaka underground is expected to cost 450 billion yen, and quad-tracking Mitaka to Tachikawa is expected to cost 360 billion yen, and both projects are expected that they will not be able to recover the project cost financially within 40 years after they open in case they’re being constructed, and thus they’re being deemed not worthwhile by the Tokyo government in a separate analysis also in 2015.\n\nBut still, in year 2018, the government of Tokyo picked 6 rail line projects, and created a fund for these projects, intended to deposit excess amount of money in their city government budget from profit from Tokyo Metro Co Ltd into such fund in order to pave way for construction of such line into the future. The extension of Keiyo line to Mitaka with the accompanying Chuo Line quad tracking between Mitaka and Tachikawa are two of the six projects being selected. The other four projects are Haneda Access Line, Kamakama line, quad-tracking Keio line, and the construction of a new loop line around 23 wards, branded as Metro Seven and Eight Liner. However, since all six projects come together would cost up to almost 3 trillion yen, and the amount of money they’re putting into in 2018 when they created such fund was only 62 billion yen, such effort of financing new lines is not expected to yield any actual progress anytime soon.\n\nMore recently, the Japanese national government have been trying to privatize Tokyo Metro, using the fund earned from such privatization on revitalization effort on area hit by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, and the way the discussion is currently heading to now is that both the national government and the Tokyo city government will sold half of their stock of the Tokyo Metro. Tokyo city government intended to use the fund earned from selling the Tokyo Metro to construct new metro lines, but the primary targets being listed are extending the Metro system to Shinagawa enhancing its position as a transportation hub, as well as the construction of Toyosumi line, filling in a missing link in the metro network on the East side of Tokyo.\n\nOne thing that should also be mention is that, JR East itself are trying to introduce longer trains on the Chuo line, although the added train cars will be premium cars, hence its effectiveness in reducing the line’s overcrowdness are still pending observation.\n\nI don’t think there are mentions of how many stations will there be on these planned lines, since those plans only represent key connecting nodes. But given the plan is to build the extended line as an subway, I think it will have station density comparable to regular subways? Specifically since one of the project goal is to improve Western Tokyo as well as Chiba’s connection into Central area of Tokyo. If it’s just Tokyo station and Shinjuku station then that wouldn’t make sense.\n\nConceptually I think it can be think as similar to Tokyo Metro Tozai Line?\n\nIt would definitely make far more sense to route the SWML trains (to Southampton and Bournemouth and Poole) and the PDL trains (to Portsmouth) into the tunnel. The WEML trains (to Exeter, via a secondary route), would be more difficult to do, as you’d need either to electrify 195 km of track from Basingstoke to Exeter, or you’d need to build trains specific to the route (they would need to have diesel engines and two types of electrification; technically possible, but no such train would be needed anywhere else in the country, so they would be rather expensive).\n\nYou would only need two underground stations – one at Waterloo and the third at whichever North London terminus you hook in. Considering that the MML and ECML outer suburbans are already on Thameslink, and considering how crowded Euston is due to be with HS2, it would make sense to relieve Euston; trains to Northampton and Milton Keynes and Coventry would fit well with Southampton, Portsmouth and Bournemouth.\n\nCurrent service pattern is (north): Hourly to Milton Keynes, Northampton (via Milton Keynes), Birmingham (via Milton Keynes and Coventry) and Crewe (via Milton Keynes) for 5tph\n\n(south): 3tph to Portsmouth, Hourly to Weymouth and Poole (both via Southampton and Bournemouth), also 5tph.\n\nThe Waterloo services are limited in frequency by access to the Waterloo approaches and platforms, which this would relieve; the Euston services are limited because they share tracks with intercity services to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. HS2 will transfer most of those intercity services onto the high-speed tracks, there would be plenty of capacity to raise frequencies on both lines.\n\nThis would also reduce above-ground non-high-speed services to Euston to just the Watford DC lines (London Overground), the 2tph Tring local service (serving suburban stations that the expresses skip), and whatever residual long-distance service survives HS2 to serve intermediate stations – probably four tph (one each to Manchester, Liverpool and Chester, plus the Birmingham/Glasgow service), which would release much more space at Euston for HS2 platforms."
