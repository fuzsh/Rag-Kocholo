Sets 8804, 8808, 8812, and 8816 have single-arm pantographs.[1]\n\nThe T car is designated as having mild air-conditioning.[1]\n\nInterior\n\n[edit]\n\nInterior view\n\nPriority seating\n\nWheelchair- and stroller-accessible free space\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe trains were originally formed as eight-car sets, with the first set introduced on 26 February 1986.[2] This was followed by four more sets in 1987, two sets in 1988, two sets in 1989, two sets in 1990, and one set in 1991.[2][3]\n\nThe original eight-car sets were formed as follows.[4] The two M2 cars were each fitted with two lozenge-type pantographs.[4]\n\nDesignation Tc1 M1 M2 T2 T1 M1 M2 Tc2 Numbering 88xx 88xx 88xx 88xx 88xx 88xx 88xx 88xx\n\nOriginal 8-car set 8889 in August 2006\n\n6-car set 8805 in original livery in April 2015\n\nWith Shin-Keisei's revised timetable on 10 December 2006, the 8800 series, alongside the 8000 and N800 series, began operation on Keisei Chiba Line through services. Three 8800 series sets (8801, 8841, and 8865) were rearranged to form four 6-car sets initially.[5]\n\nIn 2013, sets 8806 and 8815 were experimentally equipped with LED headlights, but these were subsequently replaced by conventional lights.[6] Set 8801 received LED headlights from June 2015.[6]\n\nLivery variations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first set to receive Shin-Keisei's new pink corporate livery introduced in 2014 was 8816 in August 2014.[7]\n\nSet 8811 in February 2013 in revised livery with maroon stripes\n\nSet 8803 in new corporate livery in March 2016\n\nRefurbishment\n\n[edit]\n\nA programme of refurbishment of the fleet was started in 2017, with new interior panels, flooring and seat covers. One trainset is scheduled to be treated every year.[8]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
