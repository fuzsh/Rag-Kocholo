        "text": "Funabashi Andersen Park\n\nWhere is the gateway to the world of fairy tale? About 10 minutes bus-ride (Shinkeisei-bus) from Misaki-Station will take you to the Funabashi Andersen Park, a kingdom of Flowers with a symbolic large windmill.\n\nHans Christian Andersen(1805-1875) is a fairy tale author famous for his works like “The Ugly Duckling”, “The little Mermaid”, “The little match girl” and so on. Since his birthplace, Odense, Denmark is a sister city of Funabashi, this worldly unique park was made a reality.\n\nMany Architectures of 1800s-Denmark like a large windmill, an elementary school or a farmhouse are located around the park. Surprisingly, carpenters and technicians were invited from the country to build them with indigenous materials in order to create the real atmosphere. Even the room where Andersen spent his time was reproduced in detail decorated with furniture and tableware.\n\nIt should be emphasized that walking through flowers and seeing historical architecture are NOT the only activity. The park is divided into five zones, and Laughing and cheering are flourish in “Kids Kingdom Zone”. Adventure Playground course, rainbow pond, and a vast trampoline are always filled with children, needless to say a 50-meters slide!\n\nTrip Adviser, the famous travel review site, placed The Funabashi Andersen Park in the No.3 on their Top Amusement Parks in Japan. The spring and summer time are of course the best season to visit. So take a bus ride with your family or friends and enjoy to your heart in this fantastic atmosphere! Oh, and don’t forget to eat ice cream made from fresh milk near the firm!\n\n* The discount ticket is available at the Seven Eleven, located inside Misaki Station.\n\nJapanese Restaurant UOTSUGU\n\nIt was 1967 when a small fish store “UOTSUGU” opened in Kitanarashino, contributing to local people’s everyday diets with its fresh and reasonable items. In 1991 the professional fish shop has expanded its business by starting an authentic Japanese restaurant.\n\nLocated at a quiet street, just 3-minutes-walk from Kitanarashino station, the entrance of UOTSUGU restaurant has kind of “high-class” atmosphere where the first-time customer may feel hesitated to open the door. But once go inside, the warm and happy smile of clerks, always in Japanese traditional clothes, will definitely ease the tension.\n\nThis restaurant offers seasonal cuisines, and when opening the menu book, you will be troubled (in good meaning, of course) to choose one. Sushi, Sashimi, Tempura, rice bowl, and countless small dishes are there. For example “Haru no Uraraka Gozen (The sunny spring food plate)” has more than 10 dishes in one plate, even a small “Nabe (hot pot)” is served. Needless to say its elaborate taste and freshness, the vivid color of the plate is so amusing that it feels like having a “Hanami (cherry blossom viewing) in the restaurant”. The price is just 2,800 yen (tax excluded) for it. Too reasonable compared to a same class restaurant in Tokyo. “Una-Ju (Broiled eel on the rice)” is also popular here, and the price is only 2,800 yen (tax excluded).\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is traditional Japanese style and both of Tatami-seats and chairs are available. Also the decoration is fascinating like a branch of cherry blossom, lacquer wares and many other seasonal items. Here is highly recommended place to relax with your family and friends. *Credit card is available (VISA, Master, UC, DC, AMEX, etc).\n\nKunugiyama Train Base\n\nAbout 15 minutes walk from the company office of Shin-keisei Line near Kunugiyama station, there is a Kunugiyama Train Base. A train base is where railway vehicles gather for inspection and maintenance. Normally this base is exclusively for its staffs and technicians, and only during “Thanks Festa Days”, an annual friendship event, it becomes open to public.\n\nShin-Keisei Line owns 26 trains, and each one has 6 vehicles. “All trains will be inspected in every 4 year.” Says Mr. Hanawa who worked as a technician here for more than 20 years. “About 40 days are necessary to fully finish the inspection ”.\n\nWalking inside the base, the first thing Mr. Hanawa pointed out was a brand new iron-made wheel. “The durable life of one wheel is about 12 years. It will become thinner and thinner as a train runs.” Another thing found on the floor was a paint can (Shinkeisei GENTLE Pink) used for coloring the vehicles. “It is only for iron vehicles however. Recent train is made of stainless, so sticker is used instead.” Mr. Hanawa said.\n\nSuddenly, high-tone metallic sound was heard. An old mechanic was hitting hammer on a bolt at the lower part of the vehicle. “This is a sound inspection.” He said. “We check every single bolt like this. If it is loose, it sounds dull”. He seemed very proud of his job. “ I always feel responsible for the safety of passengers.”\n\nIf you take a closer look to the train, there is always a discovery. For example, have you ever seen under the first vehicle? A “trumpet” is attached for the urgent alert. It is said that both electronic alert sound (short & small) and trumpet (long & loud) are used depending on the situation. Do you know it?\n\nNext “Thanks Festa Days” will be held on 3rd in June. Once in a year, this is the only chance to get into the Base. So please be waited for more information!"
