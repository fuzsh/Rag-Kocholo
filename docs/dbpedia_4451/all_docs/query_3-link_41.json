        "text": "Trains in Japan: First-Timer’s Guide to Japan’s Rail Network\n\nTrains in Japan and how to travel on Japan’s rail network\n\nBrimming with amazing food, iconic landmarks, sensational views and (so much) more, a trip to Japan promises a life-changing experience and an abundance of adventures. If it’s your first time in Japan, you might be a little worried about how to travel around Japan (especially if you don’t speak Japanese). Don't sweat it, we've put together a first-timer’s guide on how to get around Japan by train!\n\nHow to ride trains in Japan\n\nJapan is renowned for its extremely efficient train network, and with multiple lines connecting various cities and neighbourhoods together, it can understandably get quite confusing. Let us untangle that a bit for you!\n\nFirstly, it’s important to note that the railway lines in Japan are not operated by a single company. To put it simply, JR aka Japan Railways Group is the main railway network in Japan - it owns about 80% of the country’s railroads (where your JR Pass comes in). The remaining 20% is served by dozens of other private railway companies, especially in and around metropolitan areas.\n\nTypes of trains in Japan\n\nNext, there are different types of trains in Japan. Different trains suit different needs - for example the bullet train is the fastest transportation between cities and stops at major city stations (eg. Tokyo Station to Shin Osaka Station). If you’re planning to explore a certain area in a particular city instead, you can hop onboard a local train which stops at every station.\n\nHere’s a quick summary of the various types of trains in Japan:\n\nJapan Train Ticket Types\n\nSince there are various trains in Japan, you would need to buy different train tickets depending on what kind of train you are looking to take.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the main types of train tickets:\n\nTravelling on Japan Railways (JR)\n\nFirstly, you would’ve probably heard the benefits of getting a JR Pass for your Japan travels - but what is a JR pass and how does it help exactly?\n\nTo put it simply, the Whole Japan JR Pass:\n\nAllows tourists unlimited travel on all Japan Railways Group (JR) Shinkansen, trains, buses, and ferry services across the country\n\nIs available in 7, 14 or 21-day validity depending on the duration of your trip\n\nPrice starts from $307 AUD for a 7-day Whole Japan pass\n\nIs best if you plan to explore many different cities in Japan\n\nThere are also Regional JR Passes, that offer:\n\nUnlimited travel on all Japan Railways Group (JR) transportation - different passes cover different types of transport (trains, buses, ferry etc) in a specific area or region; Check what’s included in your pass before you purchase!\n\nDepending on the pass, different durations and flexible days are available\n\nPrice depends on location selected\n\nIs best if you only have plans to explore a specific area or specific cities as you can save more money on a regional pass rather than a Whole Japan pass\n\nFor more details on what a JR Pass covers, how much and which pass you should get, check out this guide:\n\nBeyond JR: Privately-Owned Rail Companies\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are other privately-owned rail companies in Japan. Private railways often handle intercity travel, airport connections and particular regional destinations not covered by the Japan Rail Pass. These companies often also operate local bus networks, hotels and attractions.\n\nIf you intend to explore a certain area in Japan instead of travelling from city to city, most transportation companies also offer special city passes that are great for your adventures! We’ll share more about the popular ones for tourists (sorted by cities) in greater detail below!\n\nGetting Around Tokyo\n\nHome to big city skylines, mammoth shopping streets, tasty eats and iconic attractions like Tokyo Disneyland, SHIBUYA SKY and more, Tokyo is a must-visit destination for every first-timer to Japan.\n\nCovering the whole city with almost 300 stations, Tokyo subway lines will help you get to almost any destination quickly and easily. For Tokyo, the major lines here are:\n\nJR\n\nTokyo Metro\n\nToei Lines\n\nOther lines serving Greater Tokyo\n\nFrom the Airport\n\nNarita Airport\n\n🚝 Keisei Main Line or JR Narita Express\n\nKeisei Main Line\n\nNarita International Airport is the main airport for Tokyo. Here you can take the Keisei Skyliner on the Keisei Main Linethat will get you to Tokyo’s Keisei-Ueno station. Take a short 3-min walk and you will get to Ueno Station where you can start using your JR Pass.\n\nJR Narita Express\n\nThe Narita Express \"N'EX\" is a limited express train that directly connects Narita International Airport with major cities and districts including Tokyo, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku and Yokohama. This option is covered by JR Pass.\n\nHaneda Airport\n\n🚝 Keikyu Kuko line (Keikyu Airport Line) or Tokyo Monorail\n\nKeikyu Airport Line\n\nKeikyu Airport Line is a private railway line that connects Haneda Airport to Keikyu Main Line, so you can get to Tokyo, Kawasaki and Yokohama.\n\nTokyo Monorail\n\nThe other rail option from Haneda Airport Tokyo International Airport is the Tokyo Monorail which is included in the JR Pass. You can take the monorail to Hamamatsucho Station in downtown Tokyo.\n\nCentral Tokyo\n\n🚝 JR, Tokyo Metro, Toei & Others\n\nTaking JR in Tokyo\n\nTokyo's most prominent train line is the JR Yamanote Line. The major stations are Tokyo, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya and Shinagawa\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen (bullet train) stops at Tokyo and Shinagawa.\n\nJR Regional Passes that Include Tokyo\n\nTokyo’s Subway\n\nTokyo's subway network is operated by two entities: Toei with four lines, and Tokyo Metro with nine lines. Together, they densely cover central Tokyo and provides more flexibility to explore Tokyo than the JR line.\n\nIf you are spending the day exploring within Tokyo, we recommend getting a Tokyo Subway Pass. You can choose from 24/48/72-hour validity passes. This grants unlimited access to everything in the map above as it is covered by Tokyo Metro and Toei.\n\nExploring Greater Tokyo\n\nThe Keio Line is a private railway line in Tokyo connecting Shinjuku Station in Shinjuku with the western suburbs of Chofu, Fuchu and Keio-Hachioji\n\nIntersects with other Keio Corporation owned lines in western Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture - eg. Keio Takao Line (Kitano Station to Takaosanguchi Station with access to Mt. Takao (Takaosan)\n\nRuns 3 three lines from central Tokyo to the west and Kanagawa Prefecture\n\nOffers the Odakyu Limited Express Romancecar which only has reserved seats\n\nUse to travel to Hakone Area, Mount Fuji and Lake Kawaguchi Area and more!\n\nOriginates at Ikebukuro Station, and extends to northwest suburbs as far as Tokorozawa, Saitama\n\nThe Seibu Lines connect directly to the sacred and traditional places of Kawagoe and Chichibu, where you can enjoy the charm of the Edo period to the fullest\n\nLimited express service jointly run by JR East and Tobu Railway\n\nRuns between Tobu Nikko Station in Tochigi Prefecture and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo in around 2 hours\n\nWant more info on trains in Tokyo?\n\nGetting Around Osaka\n\nFor those looking for some of the best food and fun in Japan, Osaka definitely has it all. Spend your days screaming your lungs out at Universal Studios Japan (the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and newest Super Nintendo World are a must-visit!), eating your way through Dotonbori and marvelling at wonders like the Osaka Castle and more!\n\nOsaka has two major city centers and four major train stations. The two city centres are nicknamed Kita (\"North\") around Osaka/Umeda Station and Minami (\"South\") around Namba Station. For Osaka, the major lines are:\n\nJR\n\nOsaka Metro\n\nOther lines serving Greater Osaka (Nankai Railway, Hankyu Railway, Kintetsu Railway, Hanshin Railway, Keihan Railway)\n\nFrom Kansai International Airport\n\n🚝 JR Haruka Express, Nankai Line Airport Express\n\nJR Haruka Express\n\nFor the Haruka Express, it connects the Kansai Airport with stations in the major cities in Kansai, such as Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe. It is covered in your JR Pass. From Kansai Airport Station, it takes about 35 minutes to Tennoji, 50 minutes to Shin-Osaka, and 80 minutes to Kyoto.\n\nIf you wish, you can also get a one-way ticket from the airport to your station of choice like Shin-Osaka station, Kyoto station, Tennoji Station, Nara Station or Kobe Station.\n\nNankai Airport Line\n\nThe Nankai Airport Line is operated by the Nankai Electric Railway and connects Kansai Airport to the railway network in Osaka. It is a 34-minute journey going to Namba Station inside a retro-themed train.\n\nTravelling from Tokyo to Osaka\n\n🚝 JR\n\nTokyo (Tokyo and Shinagawa stations) and Osaka (Shin-Osaka Station) are connected with each other by the JR Tokaido Shinkansen. Note that the Shinkansen trains stop not at Osaka Station, but at Shin-Osaka Station.\n\nNozomi trains require about 2.5 hours to reach Shin-Osaka Station from Tokyo, Hikari trains about 3 hours and Kodama trains about 4 hours. Do note that your JR Pass does not cover Nozomi and Mizuho trains.\n\nIf you intend to only explore Osaka alone and just need to take a single Shinkansen ride from Tokyo to Osaka, you can also get a one-way Shinkansen ticket.\n\n#KlookTip: Want to get a glimpse of the magnificent Mt.Fuji on your ride from Tokyo to Osaka or vice versa? Make sure to book the D or E seats on your ride. You will see Mt Fuji at Shin-Fuji Station!\n\nCentral Osaka\n\n🚝 JR, Osaka Metro\n\nTaking JR in Osaka\n\nMany JR lines run through the Kansai area. When going sightseeing through the Osaka area, you’ll mainly be using the JR Kyoto Line, the JR Tokaido-Sanyo Line, the JR Osaka Loop Line, and the line with the closest station to Universal Studios Japan, the Yumesaki Line. A JR Pass may be used on each of these lines.\n\nJR Osaka Loop Line: Perfect for sightseeing around Osaka\n\nOperates in a circle around the centre of Osaka\n\nThere are many sights along its tracks, such as Osaka Castle and Tsutenkaku\n\nConnects to JR Yumesaki line at Nishikujo Station that will bring you to Universal Studios Japan\n\nJR Regional Passes that Include Osaka\n\nOsaka Metro\n\nSubways are often the most convenient means of getting around central Osaka. The city has eight subway lines that connect Osaka's two main districts, Kita and Minami. The more popular lines among travellers are the Chuo Line (green) and Midosuji Line (red).\n\nIf you are exploring Osaka city we recommend snagging a Osaka Metro Pass. Similar to the Tokyo metro Pass, The Osaka Metro Pass grants you unlimited train travel in the designated Osaka Metro and Osaka City Bus routes. You can also get discounts on tickets to about 30 attractions in Osaka!
