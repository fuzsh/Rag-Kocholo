        "text": "The Narita Express – also known as N’EX – is the most convenient Tokyo city transfer from and to Narita International Airport, which hosts most of the overseas flights to Japan.\n\nThis limited express train service is fast, reliable and punctual, and you can ride it for free with your Japan Rail Pass. Find out all the travel details in this post.\n\nNarita Express is a Limited Express train, provided by JR East. To access the train, the desired seats must be reserved in advance (valid for JR Pass holders as well). You can do this easily at any of the following locations:\n\nNarita Airport Stations (Terminal 1 and 2-3)\n\nJapan Railways ticket offices\n\nTravel service centers\n\nReserved seat ticket machines\n\nImportant note: Passengers with no seat reservations will not be allowed to board any of the N’EX trains. Please, make sure to reserve your seat before boarding. Furthermore, all passengers must follow the instructions and seat indications, written on their reservation ticket.\n\nYou may find it interesting to read our article How to get from Narita Airport to Tokyo.\n\nNarita Express trains\n\nSimilar to most trains, Narita Express uses a separate railway, which means traffic never blocks it. The train offers beautiful views to and from the city, as the airport is located outside of Tokyo area.\n\nSnack cars inside the trains pass by at regular intervals, offering tasty and affordable Japanese appetizers and drinks. Facilities on the train are well maintained and spotless – in the true Japanese spirit.\n\nNarita Express trains offer luggage space and areas where you can lock your bags. Each separate seat provides a rather large seating area, which can also be used for placing your all luggage just before you. Overhead compartments above each seat are also available.\n\nNarita Express map\n\nThe N’EX has two stops in Narita Airport, Terminal 1 and Terminal 2-3. The routes are marked in red on the following map.\n\nNarita Express stations\n\nAfter leaving the 2 stations at the airport, the Narita Express stops at Tokyo Station and many major districts and cities in the region, including Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku and Yokohama.\n\nThe main Narita Express stations include:\n\nNarita (town)\n\nChiba\n\nTokyo Station\n\nShimbashi\n\nHamamatsucho (connection with Haneda Airport via Tokyo Monorail)\n\nShinagawa\n\nShibuya\n\nShinjuku\n\nYokohama\n\nIkebukuro\n\nTravel times and schedules\n\nN’EX trains take approximately:\n\n1 hour to get from and to Tokyo Station (first stop city center)\n\n1 hour and 15 minutes to Shibuya Station\n\n1 hour and 20 minutes to Shinjuku Station.\n\nThe service operates 27 trains daily, which allows for the regularity and punctuality of the service. All N’EX trains anew their journey from Tokyo or Narita Airport every 30 minutes.\n\nPlease refer to the JR East schedules page to check the latest schedules from and to Narita Airport.\n\nNarita Express tickets\n\nThere are two types of N’EX tickets: for Standard and Green Cars (First Class, similar to the Japan Rail Standard and Green class tickets). The price for each class is different (detailed below). However, the standard seats are extremely comfortable and spacious.\n\nAlso covered by Hokuriku Arch Pass\n\nAll N’EX seat reservations are available for free to any Japan Rail Pass holder. The airport transfer service is part of the many benefits the JR Pass has to offer. Holders can reserve a seat at any JR ticket office in Narita Airport, before boarding the train and without any additional payment.\n\nMoreover, there is no limitation to the number of times a JR Pass holder can use Narita Express, whereas other transportation cards like SUICA, are not valid for the service.\n\nBook your Japan Rail Pass now\n\nKeep in mind that the Keisei Skyliner service, an alternative transportation from Narita Airport to Ueno Station, is also not included in the JR Pass.\n\nPrices without the JR Pass\n\nFor all other cases, the single-trip prices of N’EX are the following:\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 to:\n\nTokyo Station – 3,070¥ / 3,840¥ Green Class (GR)\n\nShinagawa – 3,250¥ / 4,020¥ GR\n\nShibuya – 3,250¥ / 4,020¥ GR\n\nShinjuku – 3,250¥ / 4,020¥ GR\n\nIkebukuro – 3,250¥ / 4,020¥ GR\n\nOmiya – 3, 840¥ / 5,380¥ GR\n\nYokohama – 4,370¥ / 6,640¥ GR\n\nOfuna – 4,700¥ / 6,970¥ GR\n\nRound-trip ticket fares are usually around 33% off two single trips.
