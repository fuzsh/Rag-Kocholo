        "text": "There are several public transportations in Matsudo city: trains, buses, and taxies. The train is used to connect between cities and buses and taxies are used to transport inside cities or surrounding cities.\n\nThere are 3 trains arrive or pass by in Matsudo City: (1) Joban Line, (2) Joban line connected to Chiyoda line, and (3) Shin-Keisei line. If you want to go to Tokyo or travel from Tokyo, please use the Joban line or Chiyoda line. If you go to or travel from Chiba, please use the Shin-Keisei line.\n\nThe train ticket can be purchased in the ticket machine, but for the buses, you can pay directly on the bus (but you have to speak Japanese with the driver), or, there is a simple way, use Pasmo or Suica card (will be explained later).\n\nHow to Buy Train ticket\n\nIn the train station, before you enter the gate, you will find a ticket corner. There is a big board with a connecting line map above the ticket machine. please make sure that you see the right map, because a map only provide information of one train company. for example of the image below, it is only information for JR line trains. If you want to take the Shin-Keisei line, please go to the Shin-Keisei line ticket corner and you will find another connecting line map.\n\nOn the map, you will see the different colors of the routes. one color shows one train name. If you want to go to a place with no direct route, you have to follow the map to change at the changing stations on the map. Please note that not all maps provided in Romanji or English names. It is more often written in Kanji’s character.\n\nBut with the advancement of technology, you don’t really need to understand this map, you can use the direction feature in your Google Map. It is the most convenient way to get you anywhere, so please always bring your smartphone with internet connection. The things to note are the train line names (Joban line, Yamanote line, Shin-Kensei line, etc.) and the last stop destination.\n\nHowever, we will still guide you through the map, in case of an emergency. Let’s have a look at the map below.\n\nThe recent station is marked with RED ARROW. Let’s say, if you want to go from Matsudo 松戸 to Ueno 上野, it shows that you have to take 2 kinds of train, Joban line (dark green color) from Matsudo station to Nippori 日暮里 and then change to Yamanote line (bright-green color) to Ueno. It means that Nippori is the transfer station and you have to get off at Nippori station and change to Yamanote line to Ueno. Please see the number below Ueno, it is written 310. That is the cost you have to pay and to buy in the ticket machine.\n\nThe image below is the ticket machine.\n\nPlease touch the screen. You can change the language to English.

For example, if you want to go by JR train, DO NOT enter other gates (such as Toyo metro’s, Keisei’s or others’ gates).\n\nThe picture below shows the gate (JR gate as an example). Please enter the gate with green arrows, not a “stop” sign. Please enter the ticket to the yellow slot and take it again on the other side. If you use the Suica/Pasmo card, just put the card to the tab sensor. do it by walking through the gate.\n\nAfter passing the gate, please look at the train time table.

Please go to the platform that is suitable with your destination on time table.\n\nOn the platform, please wait behind the yellow line. Usually, there are some trains with different destinations on one platform.
