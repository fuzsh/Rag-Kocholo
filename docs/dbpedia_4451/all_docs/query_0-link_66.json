        "text": "Home to the New Tokyo International Airport, Narita is the first entry point of most visitors to Japan. Too many foreigners skip it altogether, heading straight for Tokyo, 80 km (50 mi) to the west. It is a shame for the small town of Narita possesses one of Japan's greatest and most colourful temples, which makes a visit to Narita really worth your while.\n\nNarita-san ShinshÅ-ji Temple æç°å±±æ°åæ\n\nThe Narita-san ShinshÅ-ji Temple attracts some 10 million (mostly Japanese) visitors annually. It is one of the main centre of the Buddhist Shingon sect in Japan and has several branches throughout Kanto.\n\nThe temple was founded in 940. The legend has it that a Goma rite dedicated to the image of Fudomyoo, which had originally been enshrined at Takaosan Jingoji Temple in KyÅto, help to miraculously suppress a revolt against Emperor Suzaku. An oracle proclaimed that the image, which had been transported from KyÅto to Narita, should stay where it was to relieve the locals from suffering. Emperor Suzaku then ordered the creation of the Narita-san temple to enshrine the FudÅmyÅ image.\n\nThe Great Main Hall is a reconstruction of 1968, but still conducts the daily Goma rite."
