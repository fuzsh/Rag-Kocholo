        "text": "The Kure-sen follows the coastline of the Inland Sea from Hiroshima eastwards. The Bay of Hiroshima, as well as the coastline to the east, is spotted with myriads of smaller and larger islands, which, together with the many small bays along the coast, also offer ideal locations for industries that require closeness to the sea. Thus we find an abundant number of shipyards which produce small and medium size vessels. Before the war, there were a large number of military facilities and associated industrial plants particularly in the Bay of Hiroshima and south thereof, in the Bay of Ondo no Seto, dominated by the town of Kure.\n\nThe railway reached Kure from Hiroshima as early as 1903 (26, 4 km). However, the continuation from Kure up the coast to Hiro and finally to Mihara was not completed until 1930-1935. The completion of the Kure-sen provided an alternative route to the main line (the San'yô Honsen), which on its way eastward needs to cross the plateau of Saijô by means of steep inclines. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Kure-sen – although single track – used to see major express and sleeping car trains. After the opening of the San'yô Shinkansen from Okayama westward in 1975, however, the Kure-sen turned into a quiet local line; it had been electrified in 1970 (DC 1500 V) and lost its freight traffic in 1986 (freight trains now all take the San'yô Honsen).\n\nThe Kure-sen today operates in two sections. The western section, first over the San'yô Honsen from Hiroshima to Kaita-ichi (6, 4 km) and from there via Kure to Hiro (26, 8 km) forms part of the suburban city network of Hiroshima and sees several stopping and semi-fast trains per hour. The eastern section (60, 2 km) from Hiro along the Inland Sea up to Mihara, where the line rejoins the San'yô Honsen, is a typical local line with one stopping train per hour and mostly worked by a two-car electric set. On specific days there is a through tourist train \"Setonai Marine View\" between Hiroshima and Mihara.\n\n＃The line was severely damaged through flooding and landslides triggered by torrential rain July 5/6, 2018. The section Mihara - Hiro (60, 2 km) cannot be reopened until 2019, through operation of trains between Hiro and Kaita-ichi (26, 8 km) will resume between August and November 2018. Fully reopened December 15, 2018, normal weekday services resumed March 16, 2019. ＃"
