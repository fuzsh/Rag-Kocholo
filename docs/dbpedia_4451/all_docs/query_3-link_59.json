        "text": "Tokyo's most important train line\n\nThe JR Yamanote Line runs in a loop around Tokyo, and a full circuit around the line takes about an hour. The trains can be recognized by their green color. They are equipped with on-board color screens above the doors, telling you what the next stop is, how long it will take to get there, and which side of the train the exit door will be on. The information is provided in both English and Japanese, as well as Korean and Chinese, thus making it one of the easier train lines to navigate around Tokyo.\n\nOpened in 1885, the Yamanote Line has become essential to the daily lives of Tokyoites.\n\nPassing all over Tokyo, it is the perfect line to travel there. It is a \"circular\" train line looping through the capital and passing through some of the city's most famous neighborhoods. Shibuya, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, and Akihabara are all served by the Yamanote line.\n\nThe Yamanote line connects 30 different stations. It can be dentified via its green color and the letters JY. Each station is identified by a number; for example, Ikebukuro is designated as JY 13 and Shibuya as JY 20.\n\nIs the Yamanote Line accessible to tourists?\n\nThe Yamanote Line is also very easy to use for travelers passing through Tokyo.\n\nJapan Rail Pass holders can take advantage of the line for free ;\n\nInformation and instructions are systematically available in English in the carriages, on the platforms and in the station ;\n\nImportant announcements are also made in English.\n\nThe teams of the JR East company, in charge of the line, will be able to understand you and help you in your travels.\n\nIn short, this is the most accessible line in Tokyo for non-Japanese-speaking visitors.\n\nNavigating the Yamanote Line\n\nThe Yamanote line travels 34.5 kilometers in one hour, with trains departing every two minutes during the day and every 30 seconds during rush hours. It is best to avoid rush hour on the Yamanote Line, especially, as it is very crowded, servicing the most prominent stations in Tokyo's center. The train service begins its service around 4.30 AM and runs until 1 AM the next day. Unlike train systems in other countries, one's in Japan do not run 24 hours, which is something those venturing out late at night in Tokyo should be aware of. To ensure the accurate operating time of the train line in Japan, we recommend you check the dedicated train travel phone application, Jorudan.\n\nThe train line is covered by the Japan Rail Pass, as well as other JR Lines in the city and all Shinkansen bullet train lines that go throughout Japan.\n\nFrom Tokyo to Tamachi Stations\n\n0 km - Tokyo Station\n\nThe city's namesake station is elegantly designed and surrounded by a number of high-end commercial establishments.

From there, it will extend out to Hiroshima then down to Hakata Station in Fukuoka City. Travelers going out to Takayama can make a transfer at Nagoya Station to ride the Hida Limited Express. The Hokuriku Shinkansen will go out to Tsuruga in Fukui and pass destinations such as Nagano, Toyama, and Kanazawa on the way. The Tohoku Shinkansen heads up north, right to the southern end of Hokkaido and passes by cities like Sendai in Miyagi, Fukushima, and Iwate.\n\nThe train station is divided into two parts: Marunouchi and Yaesu.\n\nA short walk north-west from the Marunouchi exit of the station will lead you to the Imperial Palace and the Imperial Palace East Gardens.
