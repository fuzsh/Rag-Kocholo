        "text": "Located in the northeast region of Tokyo, Arakawa Ward is sandwiched between Adachi to the north and Taito to the south. Arakawa Ward gets its name from the Arakawa River, but the river neither runs through nor borders the ward. Within the ward limits is a mix of old-fashioned downtown areas and residential neighborhoods. The hub station of Nippori is located in Arakawa, and is serviced by the Keisei Skyliner which allows for easy transportation to Narita Airport (approximately 58 minutes away).\n\nContents\n\nArakawa quick facts\n\nMain residential neighborhoods\n\nArakawa Ward ranks high for\n\nWho lives in Arakawa Ward?\n\nPopular housing searches in Arakawa Ward\n\nLocation and highlights\n\nArakawa quick facts\n\nPopulation: 215,966 (as of January 1, 2019)\n\nArea: 10.16 km²\n\nDensity: 21,256 (/km²)\n\nPopulation of foreign residents: 19,131 (8.9% of total population of Arakawa)\n\nAbout 4.1% of the total resident foreigner population of the Tokyo 23 Wards lives in Arakawa.\n\nMajor Train Stations\n\nStation Train Lines Nippori JR Yamanote Line JR Keihin-Tohoku Line JR Joban Line Keisei Main Line Toei Nippori-Toneri Liner Nishi-Nippori JR Yamanote Line JR Keihin-Tohoku Line Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line Toei Nippori-Toneri Liner Machiya Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line Keisei Main Line Toei Toden Arakawa Line\n\nMain residential neighborhoods\n\nArakawa\n\nMachiya\n\nMinamisenju\n\nHigashinippori\n\nArakawa ranks high for\n\nQuiet, residential neighborhoods within commuting distance to the business districts of Tokyo.\n\nCharming traditional Tokyo storefronts and cafes adorn the Yanesen area.\n\nRiverfront paths along the Sumida River offer relaxing places for walking and running.\n\nNippori Station is connected directly to Narita Airport.\n\nWho lives in Arakawa Ward?\n\nThose looking for quick access to the Yamanote Line via Nippori or Nishi-Nippori.\n\nOld Koreatown provides a community for many Korean residents.\n\nPopular housing searches in Arakawa Ward\n\nGaijinPot Housing Service apartments near Machiya (application process handled in English, overseas applications OK, utilities can be set up prior to your arrival)\n\nNo key money apartments in Minamisenju\n\nLocation and highlights\n\nArakawa Ward is outlined by the Sumida River, which provides a peaceful riverfront path for afternoon walks. The paths near the river are also quite popular with joggers and runners. In addition, Arakawa has plenty of parks that are great open spaces to let kids run around, including Ogunohara Park, Arakawa Natural Park, Arakawa Park, and Shiori Park.\n\nArakawa Ward is home to one of the oldest Koreatowns in Tokyo, near Mikawashima Station. Unlike the pop-culture packed streets of Shinokubo, the Arakawa Koreatown is much more reserved and tame. You’ll be able to find Korean markets and restaurants lining the streets of the Koreatown in Arakawa.\n\nSouth Arakawa (Yanaka and Nippori)\n\nThe very tip top of the Yanesen area extends into Arakawa. Yanesen is a Japanese anagram for Yanaka, Nezu, and Sendagi. These three neighborhoods are collectively referred to as Yanesen, and are famous for preserving traditional Tokyo. The Yanaka area can be found just around Nippori, and is home to a variety of older post-war style Japanese cafes and restaurants. It’s a great section of Tokyo to explore on a lazy Sunday when you can some time to enjoy the charms of a bygone era.\n\nCentral Arakawa (Machiya)\n\nWest of Machiya Station you’ll find some shopping malls (Sunpop Machiya, Akafudado Machiya) which add a nice touch of convenience to this corner of Tokyo. Oddly enough, Machiya Station only exits to the east, so you’ll have to walk around it to get to these shopping centers.\n\nTo the east of Machiya Station is primarily residential neighborhoods. Arakawa Natural Park also is a short walk to the east of the station.\n\nEast Arakawa (Minami-Senju)\n\nThere are a few shopping centers (Lala Terrace Minamisenju, Bibi Minamisenju) near Minami-Senju Station, boosting the livability of the surrounding neighborhoods. To the north is Kita Senju just one train stop away (technically in Adachi Ward), which also boasts a surprising amount of restaurants and shops.\n\nMinami Senju Station is connected to the Joban Line and Hibiya Line. This makes it possible to travel directly to Tokyo (15 minutes on the Joban Line) or Roppongi (32 minutes on the Hibiya Line).\n\nApartments for Rent in Arakawa Ward\n\nProperties for Sale in Arakawa Ward\n\nLead photo: iStockphoto"
