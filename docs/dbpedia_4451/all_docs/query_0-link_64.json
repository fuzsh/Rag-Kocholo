        "text": "Ueno Station\n\nUeno Station is a major transport hub in Tokyo including direct rapid train service to Narita Airport. As the nearest station to destinations including Ueno Zoo, the Tokyo National Museum, the University of Tokyo and dining and entertainment precincts of Ueno, the station is always busy with the surrounding area offering lots of entertainment and accommodation. On this page you will find the following information:\n\n— Train Lines / Services to Ueno Station\n\n— Train Lines to Narita & Haneda Airports\n\n— Transfer from Airport Lines to the Shinkansen\n\n— Rail Passes Covering Travel to Nagano\n\n— Purchasing & Activating a JR Pass\n\n— Private Charter to / from Ueno Station\n\n— Ueno Station Tourist Information\n\n— Accommodation In & Around the Station\n\n— Where to Stay in Tokyo?\n\n— How to Get to Tokyo\n\n— 30 Day-trips & Getaways Near Tokyo\n\n— Plan Your Visit to Japan\n\nIt is important to note that the following information is intended for visitors coming through Ueno Station on enroute to Nagano and Central Japan. It only touches the surface of everything we could cover about the station and does not include detailed information about train lines running to other regions, but for visitors heading to and from our home region of Central Japan, we hope it assists in making your transfer there, as easy and smooth as possible.\n\n<span style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” data-mce-type=”bookmark” class=”mce_SELRES_start”></span>\n\nFor visitors heading to Central Japan, Ueno Station is a stop on the Hokuriku Shinkansen Line heading to Nagano and onto Kanazawa, while also connected to Narita Airport by the Keisei Skyliner via nearby Keisei-Ueno Station. Rather than head to Tokyo Station, you can use the Keisei Skyliner to access Ueno Station and once there, transfer to the shinkansen service bound for Nagano or many other destinations.\n\nTRAIN LINES / SERVICES TO UENO STATION\n\nAs one of the largest train stations in Japan, Ueno is serviced by many rapid and inner-city trains. Importantly for international visitors, Ueno Station is a stop on multiple ‘Shinkanksen’ (Bullet Train) lines making it a convenient launching point from where to head-out of Tokyo including:\n\n— HOKURIKU: to Tsuruga via Nagano Station\n\n— JOETSU: to Niigata via Echigo-Yuzawa\n\n— TOHOKU: to Shin-Aomori\n\n— YAMAGATA: to Shinjo via Yamagata (connects to Tohoku Shinkansen)\n\n— AKITA: to Akita (connects to Tohoku Shinkansen)\n\n— HOKKAIDO: to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto (connects to Tohoku Shinkansen)\n\nFor travellers heading to Nagano and other regions in Central Japan, the first two shinkansen lines listed above – Hokuriku and Joetsu and – operate from Ueno Station to different station in our region. As such, we have provided further detail below about how to use them. The Tokaido Shinkansen runs west toward Nagoya – the largest city in Central Japan – however this service does not operate from Ueno Station. To use the Tokaido Shinkansen, head to nearby Tokyo Station. For shinkansen lines servicing other regions of Japan – Tohoku, Yamagata and Akita – click on the links above for further information.\n\nAs the map above shows, there are no shinkansen lines running south to north / north to south through the region however several rapid/limited express services run from the following stations and in doing so, connect the Hokuriku and Tokaido lines: 1. Limited Express Shinano from Nagano to Nagoya via Matsumoto; 2. Limited Express Hida from Toyama to Nagoya via Takayama; and 3. Limited Express Thunderbird from Tsuruga to Kyoto and Osaka.\n\nHOKURIKU SHINKANSEN\n\nRunning from Tokyo Station to Tsuruga Station, the Hokuriku Shinkansen stops at the following stations:\n\nTokyo / Ueno / Omiya / Kumagaya / Honjo-Waseda / Takasaki / Annaka-Haruna / Karuizawa / Sakudaira / Ueda / Nagano / Iiyama / Joetsu-Myoko / Itoigawa / Kurobe-Unazukionsen / Toyama / Shin-Takaoka / Kanazawa / Komatsu / Kaga Onsen / Awara Onsen / Fukui / Echizen Takefu / Tsuruga\n\nTwo services – the Kagayaki and Hakutaka – operate from Tokyo all the way to Tsuruga via Ueno. The Kagayaki is reservation-only and stops at Ueno, Omiya, Nagano and Toyama before terminating at Tsuruga. The journey from Ueno to Tsuruga takes a little pver 3 hours and Ueno to Nagano takes 80 minutes. The Hakutaka included both reserved and non-reserved carriages and stops at a great number of stations. It takes between 180 to 200 minutes (depending on the stations included in the specific service) to travel from Ueno to Kanazawa (further to the last station, Tsuruga) and 90 to 95 minutes to travel from Ueno to Nagano. A third service – Asama – is only available from Ueno to Nagano. It includes both reserved and non-reserved carriages and stops at all stations between Ueno and Nagano, taking between 100 to 110 minutes. A fourth service – Tsurugi – is also available on the Hokuriku Shinkansen but only between Toyama and Tsuruga and does not service Ueno Station. Information regarding how to book a ticket can also be found on our ‘How To: Shinkansen Reservations to Nagano’ page. The Hokuriku Shinkansen is covered by the Japan Rail (JR) Pass, JR East Pass and JR Hokuriku Pass. For further details, please see below.\n\nJOETSU SHINKANSEN\n\nThe Joetsu Shinkansen runs from Tokyo to Niigata and services Echigo-Yuzawa, located approximately at the mid-point of the line, and the surrounding ski resorts. The following stations are on the Joetsu line:\n\nTokyo / Ueno / Omiya / Kumagaya / Honjo-Waseda / Takasaki / Jomo-Kogen / Echigo-Yuzawa* / Urasa / Nagaoka / Tsubame-Sanjo / Niigata\n\nRefer to our ‘Joetsu Shinkansen Timetable’ page for daily train schedules to and from Tokyo. There are two services on the line – the Toki and Tanigawa. The Toki (including Max Toki) is the fastest. Stopping at only a limited number of stations it takes around 80 minutes to reach Echigo-Yuzaawa and 130 minutes to reach Niigata. The Tanigawa (including Max Tanigawa) does not operate all the way to Niigata and mainly runs in the morning and evening to cover peak periods. Stopping all stations between Tokyo and its final destination, the Tanigawa takes around 80 to 90 minutes to reach Echigo-Yuzawa. All services on the Hokuriku Shinkansen are covered by the Japan Rail (JR) Pass and JR East Pass – see below for details.\n\n*In winter, some shinkansen services continue onto a winter-only stop at Gala-Yuzawa, directly underneath the ski resort of the same name.\n\nTOHOKU SHINKASEN inc. YAMAGATA, AKITA & HOKKAIDO LINES\n\nRunning from Tokyo to Shin-Aomori via stations including Fukushima, Sendai and Morioka, the Tohoku Shinkansen runs to the north-east of the capital and stops at:\n\nTokyo / Ueno / Omiya / Oyama / Utsunomiya / Nasu-Shiobara / Shin-Shirakawa / Koriyama / Fukushima / Shiroishi-Zao / Sendai / Furukawa / Kurikoma-Kogen / Ichinoseki / Mizusawa-Esashi / Kitakami / Shin-Hanamaki / Morioka / Iwate-Numakunai / Ninohe / Hachinohe / Shichinohe-Towada / Shin-Aomori\n\nIt is the longest shinkansen line in Japan and connects to three regional shinkansen lines: 1. the Yamagata Shinkansen via Fukushima Station 2. the Akita Shinkansen via Morioka Station, and 3. the Hokkaido Shinkansen via Shin-Aomori Station. Unlike most shinkansen lines, which feature one or two different series of train, the Tohoku is serviced by five different series making it popular with trainspotters. It’s length and connection to three regional lines also means that there are many different services. The Hayabusa is the fastest of them taking between 185 to 195 minutes to reach Shin-Aomori from Ueno, stopping at a limited number of stations including Sendai and Morioka – all carriages on this service are reservation only. The Yamabiko operates between Tokyo and Morioka, taking between 125 to 190 minutes from Ueno – including both reserved and non-reserved seating. The Nasuno runs from Tokyo to Koriyama and stopping all stations in between. The entire service is non-reserved and typically operates in the morning and evening, intended for people moving in and out of Tokyo for work. Two other services, the Tsubasa and Komachi start from Tokyo and connect through to the Yamgata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen lines, respestively. The Tsubasa takes around 210 minutes to cover the entire journey to Shinjo Station in Yamagata Prefecture while Komachi takes between 195 to 225 minutes to reach Akita Station in Akita Prefecture from Ueno. All of these services are covered by the Japan Rail (JR) Pass, noting that for reservation only services, you need to go into an office to book at seat but pass-holders can do so at no additional cost.\n\nTRAIN LINES TO NARITA & HANEDA AIRPORTS\n\nTokyo is serviced by two international airports – Narita and Haneda. Narita is substantially further from the city than Haneda, however a rapid train service makes the journey quick and easy. From Ueno Station, Narita Airport is accessible using the rapid Keisei Skyliner service from Keisei-Ueno Station (nearby Ueno Station) while Haneda Airport is accessible using the Tokyo Monorail (via Hamamatsucho Station).\n\nTO NARITA: KEISEI SKYLINER\n\nThe Keisei Skyliner operates to and from Keisei-Ueno Station, a short walk from the Central Entrance / Exit of Ueno Station. This rapid service train connects Ueno to Narita Airport with stops at both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. The Keisei Skyliner takes between 40 to 55 minutes to travel from Keisei Ueno Station to the airport (depending on which service and terminal you are using), also stopping at Nippori Station – around 35 minutes – enroute to the airport.\n\nThe earliest service departs Keisei Ueno Station at 05:58 and arrives at Narita at 06:42. The latest service departs Keisei Ueno Station at 18:20 and arrives at Narita at 19:06. Both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 have a Skyliner & Keisei Information Center, open daily from 07:00 until 21:00. For daily train schedules, see our ‘Keisei Skyliner Timetable’ page. Foreign language-speaking staff – including English, Chinese and Korean – are usually on-hand to assist. Tickets are available using the ticket machines or service windows at the station and airport terminals. All seats on the Skyliner are reserved and cost JPY2520 per adult and JPY1270 per child from Keisei-Ueno Station to Narita. It is important to note that the Keisei Skyliner is not covered by any Japan Rail (JR) Pass.\n\nTO HANEDA AIRPORT: TOKYO MONORAIL via HAMAMATSUCHO STATION\n\nServicing Haneda Airport, the Tokyo Monorail connects the airport to Ueno Station via Hamamatsucho Station in around 35 to 40 minutes. Overall, Haneda is the busier of the two airports handles fewer international flights than Narita. Most international services from Haneda arrive and depart at Terminal 3. The Tokyo Monorail is used by many people going about their daily lives. Designed for general commuters it is not as comfortable or spacious as the Skyliner and navigating your way on and off with luggage at peak hour ca be a little challenging. Nevertheless, the monorail makes the journey to and from Haneda Airport quick and relatively smooth. From Ueno Station, take the JR Yamanote Line bound for Osaki or JR Keihin-Tohoku/Negishi Line Rapid bound for Ofuna and disembark at Hamamatsucho Station (12-15 min/JPY170). At Hamamatsucho, transfer to the Tokyo Monorail bound for Haneda Airport (20 min/JPY500). The Tokyo Monorail is covered by the JR Pass, JR East Pass and JR Hokuriku Arch Pass. These are regular inner-city services and as such, advanced bookings are not required/possible.\n\nTRANSFER FROM AIRPORT LINES TO THE SHINKANSEN\n\nThis is quite a straightforward process. Once you arrive at Keisei-Ueno Station follow the signs to the Main Exit. As you depart the station turn left and walk straight. Ueno Station is directly in front of you, only a couple of minutes walk. Enter Ueno Station and follow the signs to the shinkansen ticket office and platforms (on your right). It really is quite simple.\n\nRAIL PASSES COVERING TRAVEL TO NAGANO\n\nThere is no escaping the fact that travel using the shinkansen is expensive. Given the speed and distances covered by these trains, travelers should think of them much like taking a flight, with tickets accordingly priced. International visitors to Japan have the option of purchasing one of several passes which allow for unlimited use of the Hokuriku along with other services:\n\nJAPAN RAIL (JR) PASS\n\nCovering all 9 shinkansen lines in Japan and many other train services, the JR Pass is a great option for visitors planning to use the shinkansen more than a handful of times and/or travel large distances. Travelers have the option of 7, 14 and 21-day passes covering either Ordinary or Ordinary and Green Cars. The JR Pass allows for use of almost any service on the shinkansen lines at no additional cost but noting that should holders wish to have a reserved seat, they are still required to book a seat at the ticket office (at no additional cost).\n\nJAPAN RAIL (JR) EAST PASS / NAGANO & NIIGATA\n\nThis pass covers the Hokuriku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines serving Nagano and Niigata, along with other regional services. There is only one option of pass, covering 5 days of use within a 14-day period from its date of activation. Notably cheaper than the JR Pass, this is a great option for visitors staying within Nagano and Niigata. Much like the JR Pass, it allows for use of any service on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line at no additional cost but noting that should holders wish to have a reserved seat, they are still required to book a seat at the ticket office (at no additional cost).\n\nHOKURIKU ARCH PASS\n\nValid for 7 consecutive days from date of activation, the Hokuriku Arch Pass covers train services from Tokyo – including trains from both Narita and Haneda Airports – to Nagano and Kanazawa and then onto Kyoto, Osaka and Kansai Airport. For many international visitors, this pass covers the majority of their intended destinations as the they follow the most popular tourist route from Tokyo to Kanazawa and onto Kyoto and Osaka. Notably cheaper than the full JR Pass, the Hokuriku Arch Pass offers fantastic convenience and savings\n\nPURCHASING & ACTIVATING A JR PASS\n\nPasses can be purchased via the official website or via a JR-affiliated sales office. Once you completed payment, you will receive an exchange order. This is a proof of payment and looks almost like a flight ticket with your personal details, type of Pass, and validity (three months from the date of issue). It is important to note that the exchange order is not your actual pass and will need to be exchanged for your pass once in Japan. Whatever you do, do not lose the exchange order and prioritise exchanging it for your pass when you arrive.\n\nOnce in Japan and prior to using your pass, you must actually get your hands on it by exchanging the order/proof of purchase you received online. This can be done a numerous JR Pass Exchange Offices found at any major train station or airport, including Narita and Haneda Airports. If you have time to do so before leaving the airport, you can use the pass immediately. Alternatively, passes can be exchanged/activated at Ueno Station at:\n\n— JR East Travel Service Center: 08:30 to 19:00 (18:00 on weekends & holidays)\n\nTo exchange/activate your pass you will need your exchange order and passport. Make sure you allow adequate time to exchange and activate your pass if you are intending to use it on the same day or do so a day or two before you plan to start using it (you can always nominate a later activation date). Once you have your activated pass you are free to ride however you can’t insert your pass into the ticket gates. Simply walk through the side booth (permanently attended by station staff) and show your pass. You will be waved through and you can make your way to the platform.\n\nPRIVATE CHARTERS TO / FROM UENO STATION\n\nBased in Nagano, we are the region’s No.1-rated tour and charter operator.
