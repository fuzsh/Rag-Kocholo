Oh, we know, it’s just missing some thrilling train experience to complete your stay!\n\nTrains in Japan are well-known for being modern, always on time, and super convenient. In fact, Japanese trains are among the fastest in the world! There are six different types of trains you can hop aboard: the famous shinkansen (aka Japanese bullet trains), local trains, express, limited express, and heaps more. Sounds dizzying? Never fear! We’ll walk you through each and every train in Japan:\n\nShinkansen\n\nLocal\n\nExpress\n\nSemi-Express\n\nRapid\n\nLimited Express\n\n1. Shinkansen 新幹線\n\nNo introductions needed: the shinkansen (a.k.a. bullet trains) are the fastest trains in Japan, perhaps even the world! Thanks to the genius of Japanese engineers, you can speed from Tokyo to Osaka in just under three hours. The shinkansen bullet trains use magnetic levitation to achieve a startling speed of 320 kilometres per hour. Riding it will make you feel like you’re floating, an experience worth its price!\n\nIn total, there are nine shinkansen train lines you can take. The routes cover the northernmost island of Hokkaido to Japan’s southern tip, Kyushu. The rail system connects almost every major city in the country, thus making it easy to discover all of Japan, apart from Tokyo:\n\nName\n\nRoute\n\nStops\n\nOperator\n\nTokaido Shinkansen\n\nTokyo - Shin-Osaka\n\nShinagawa, Shin-Yokohama, Odawara, Atami, Nagoya, Kyoto\n\nJR Central\n\nSanyo Shinkansen\n\nShin-Osaka – Hakata\n\nShin-Kobe, Himeji, Okayama, Hiroshima, Shin-Shimonoseki\n\nJR West\n\nTohoku Shinkansen\n\nTokyo – Shin-Aomori\n\nUtsunomiya, Fukushima, Sendai, Morioka\n\nJR East\n\nKyushu Shinkansen\n\nHakata – Kagoshima\n\nShin-Tosu, Kumamoto\n\nJR Kyushu, JR West\n\nJoetsu Shinkansen\n\nTokyo – Niigata\n\nUeno, Takasaki, Echigo-Yuzawa, Tsubame-Sanjo\n\nJR East\n\nHokuriku Shinkansen\n\nTakasaki – Kanazawa\n\nUeda, Nagano, Toyama, Shin-Takaoka\n\nJR East, JR West\n\nHokkaido Shinkansen\n\nShin-Aomori – Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto\n\nOkutsugaru-Imabetsu, Kikonai\n\nJR Hokkaido\n\nAkita Shinkansen\n\nMorioka – Akita\n\nMorioka, Shizukuishi, Tazawako, Kakunodate\n\nJR East\n\nYamagata Shinkansen\n\nFukushima – Shinjo\n\nYonezawa, Takajata, Akayu, Yamagata, Murayama, Oishida\n\nJR East\n\nKlook Tip: All shinkansen trains are owned by the JR company, so you can use your JR Pass for Whole Japan to enjoy up to 21 days of unlimited train travel across the country!\n\n2. Local 普通\n\nIf your travel plans involve exploring every corner of a city, you’ll likely be riding the local trains a lot. Local Japanese trains, such as those under the Yamanote line in Tokyo and the Osaka loop line, go from point A to point B, stopping at every station under the route. Because this train has the most stops, it’s also the slowest of all the Japanese trains. But don’t sweat! In exchange, you’ll get to know the city like the back of your hand!\n\nKlook Tip: Look out for the “各駅停車” (meaning: this train stops at every station) on the signboard to check whether the incoming train is a local train.\n\n3. Express 急行\n\nWhile you’re touring Tokyo, make sure that you get to ride an express train (or trains that only stop at notable stations). Often, this kind of train services airport transfers, such as the Tokyo Monorail, which goes to Haneda International Airport,Narita Express to Narita International Airport, and Haruka Express to Kansai International Airport.\n\n4. Semi-Express 準急\n\nSemi-express trains are different from express trains in the way that semi-express trains skip a station every often so that it wouldn’t be as packed during rush hour.\n\n5. Rapid 快速\n\nWanna see Japan’s most popular tourist spots before it gets crowded? Take the rapid train! Rapid trains are similar to semi-express, but it’s much quicker, with fewer stops. And the best thing yet, you don’t need to pay a special fare! You can just climb aboard using regular train tickets.\n\n6. Limited Express 特急\n\nLimited express is also known as special express. This train stops only at the busiest train stations across Japan, such as Sapporo, Nagano, Osaka, Kyoto, and heaps more. Limited express trains have the fewest stops, so they’ll get you to your destination in a flash, which is best for long-distance travel:\n\nLimited Express Kamui and Lilac (Sapporo and Asahikawa)\n\nLimited Express Shinano (Nagoya and Nagano)\n\nLimited Express Shirayuki (Joetsu-Myoko and Niigata)\n\nLimited Express Hokuto (Sapporo and Hakodate)\n\nLimited Express Thunderbird (Osaka and Kyoto)\n\nLimited Express Kawasemi Yamasemi (Kumamoto and Hitoyoshi)\n\nLimited Express Hitachi and Tokiwa (Shinagawa, Tokyo, Ueno, Katsuta, and Iwaki)\n\nLimited Express Inaji (Toyohashi and Iida)\n\nLimited Express Shiosai (Tokyo, Choshi, Naruto, and Sakura)\n\nLimited Express Wakashio (Tokyo, Kazusa-Ichinomiya, Katsuura, and Awa-Kamogawa)\n\nLimited Express Sazanami (Tokyo and Kimizu)\n\nLimited Express Super Oki (Tottori, Yonago, and Shin-Yamaguchi)\n\nLimited Express Super Matsukaze (Tottori, Yonago, and Masuda)\n\nLimited Express Hamakaze (Tottori, Hamasaka, Kasumi, Osaka, Kobe, and Himeji)\n\nLimited Express Super Hakuto (Tottori, Osaka, and Kyoto)\n\nLimited Express A Ressha de Ikou/ A-Train (Amakasua and Kumamoto)\n\nLimited Express Soya (Sapporo, Asahikawa, and Wakkanai)\n\nLimited Express Ibusuki no Tamatebako (Kagoshima-Chuo and Ibusuki)\n\nYou can check the full list of limited express trains here\n\nOf course, this comes with a price. Most rail companies with limited express services charge passengers an extra fee, so prepare to shell out a few more bucks.\n\nAre there other types of trains in Japan I need to know about?\n\nPhew that wasn’t a lot, was it? Besides the six main train types, you should also look out for commuter rapid trains that operate during rush hour and the holiday rapid trains that run on weekends and holidays. Dizzying? We know, but trust us, once you get the hang of Japanese trains, travel will be a breeze!\n\nTypes of Railway Operators\n\nAnother Japan train travel must-know: knowing who operates which trains!\n\nJapan Railway (JR)\n\nThe Japan Railways (JR) was once a government-owned railway. Today, it’s Japan’s leading train company, with a wide network of trains throughout the country. From scenic and local trains to limited express and shinkansen, you’ll likely be riding at least one or two JR trains throughout the trip.\n\nKlook Tip: Make your Japan trip shine with a JR Pass, and travel city to city with just one train ticket. The JR Pass lets you hop aboard all JR trains and enjoy unlimited travel from seven to 21 days max!\n\nWanna learn more about the JR Pass? Check out our handy-dandy guide:\n\nPrivate trains\n\nTrain travel in Japan isn’t only limited to JR trains; there are also 16 major railways owned by private companies that you can ride. These trains often provide passenger service between major cities and commuter services in urban areas. Each railway company has its own separate routes, as well as ones that overlap with JR trains and other train tracks for more convenient travel:\n\nTobu Railway\n\nSeibu Railway\n\nKeisei Electric Railway\n\nKeio Corporation\n\nOdakyu Electric Railway\n\nTokyu Railways\n\nKeikyu Corporation\n\nTokyo Metro\n\nSotetsu Holdings\n\nNagoya Railroad\n\nKintetsu Railway\n\nNankai Electric Railway\n\nKeihan Electric Railway\n\nHankyu Railway\n\nHanshin Electric Railway\n\nNishi-Nippon Railroad\n\nNote: different railway companies require different tickets, so check ahead before you board.\n\nPublic trains\n\nPublic trains in Japan are operated by, you guessed it, the government. In Tokyo, the TOEI Subway is funded and run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation.\n\nHow do I know which train ticket to buy?\n\nWith so many trains in Japan, buying the correct train tickets can sound a tough job. Well great news: it doesn’t have to be when you have a JR Pass for Whole Japan. This way, you can just hop on any JR train, including the famous shinkansen trains and JR’s express trains, for up to 21 days! Pretty cool, right?\n\nNeed more time to think about booking those passes? We totally get it, so here’s a guide on why the JR Pass is worth it and its cool perks:\n\nWritten by: Jianne Uy"
