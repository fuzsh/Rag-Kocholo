[...] He traces an open universe by sailing as well on the tunes of the terroir and voodoo songs as on jazz or western or Haitian art music [...] The inspiration is abundant and David Bontemps will leave his mark.»\n\nHe released two solo recordings:\n\n- Vibrations, released in 2012 on the label Nuits d'Afrique, a disc dedicated to his piano compositions for which he received a grant from the Conseil des Arts et des Lettres du Québec and the Canada Council for the Arts. Praised by the press (Magazine Audio ranked this album at the top of its preferences of the year), Vibrations has been presented in many recitals: in October 2012 to a full hall at McGill University’s Redpath Concert Hall and at the Canadian Museum of Civilization Theatre in 2013.\n\n- Gede Nibo, 2017, distributed by Sélect, is a disc devoted to his variations on the famous theme of the Haitian composer Ludovic Lamothe (1882-1953), with which he supported a piano festival in Jacmel, the Haiti Piano Project, led by the pianist Célimène Daudet. With this repertoire he also performed the first part of a recital by pianist Alain Lefèvre in 2018, then performed in a joint recital with violinist Er-Gene Kahng in California in 2019.\n\nOn IciMusique (CBC-Radio-Canada), Frédéric Cardin wrote in 2017 that the recordings of the pianist David Bontemps help \"discover an unsuspected part of Haitian music: classical music!\" then, in 2022, Marie-Christine Trottier described him as a “master of the decompartmentalization.”\n\nIn 2006 he founded and directed the Creole jazz quintet Makaya for which he composes and arranges most of the songs. This group, winner of the Bronze Medal at the Syli d'Or World Music Competition in 2007, released its homonymous first record in May 2009. Thanks to this album, the quintet was finalist at the TD Grand Jazz Award at the International Jazz Festival of Montreal in 2010.\n\nWith a second album, Elements, distributed by Sélect and released in 2016 with a grant of the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec, Makaya collected enthusiasm and admiration: topping jazz and world music airplay on IciMusique and CIBL radios, among best performances in the 2016 FIJM by Le Devoir, and the Vision Diversity and CIBL prizes. In 2018-19, the quintet toured 14 houses of culture in Montreal as part of the Conseil des Arts de Montréal en tournée.\n\nIn 2015, he composed and recorded the music for 12 short films from the Through Positive Eyes project, UCLA, to counter the stigma of HIV-positive people.\n\nIn 2020, he arranged and orchestrated 10 Haitian folk songs for string quartet, featured on baritone Wilbert Chancy’s album Envitasyon (Invitation).\n\nHis suite Traces was chosen by Toronto choreographer Kevin A.

His innate talent and unwavering dedication propelled him towards the realm of string instruments, ultimately leading him to embrace the cello.\n\nIn the vibrant musical hub of Port-au-Prince, Durand, along with his father Gaston and brother Auguste, formed the Durand String Trio. Their musical prowess caught the attention of the Orchestra of the Charles Miot High School of Music, where they collaborated with European instrumentalists seeking refuge during World War II. This collaboration transformed the Durand Trio into a string quartet, marking the beginning of Durand's lifelong commitment to chamber music.\n\nWith the addition of renowned musicians such as Richard Einstein and Electo Silva, the quartet evolved into a formidable ensemble, captivating audiences with their innovative interpretations and original compositions. Durand's deep-rooted passion for music extended beyond performance; he was also a prolific composer and arranger, blending Haitian themes with classical influences to create captivating works.\n\nOne of Durand's most celebrated compositions is his String Quartet, composed in 1946 as a tribute to Dvorak and Smetana. This masterpiece, characterized by its seamless fusion of classical structure and Haitian thematic elements, garnered widespread acclaim locally and internationally.

After excelling in the interpretation of classical European melodies, he continued his musical studies in Germany successfully, winning competitions and introducing Haitian music throughout Europe.\n\nAnsy Dérose is both a poet, composer, performer, and arranger. Returning to Haiti in 1964, he consolidated his reputation as a performer and composer, recording several successful albums. His major entry onto the international stage was at the \"First World Festival of Song\" held in Mexico in November 1970, featuring the biggest names in European and South American music, conductors, and arrangers such as Paul Mauriat, Franck Pourcel, Pochio Perez. Among the 70 represented countries, his song \"Maria,\" one of his earliest compositions arranged by Pochio Perez, won the third trophy. This earned him a column on the front page of the official newspaper \"Olimpo\" of Mexico where it read: \"...With Ansy Dérose from Haiti, the chain of European triumphers is broken.\"\n\nIn 1972, he released his first album \"Ansy, his Music and his Poetry\" and in 1974 \"Quo Vadis Terra,\" both of which enjoyed boundless success. His collaboration with his wife, Yole Ledan Dérose, added an extra dimension to his career, their duo becoming legendary in the Haitian music scene. His LP \"Nou vle,\" released in 1987 before the first presidential elections, is perhaps the most vibrant expression of the Haitian soul.\n\nAnsy Dérose was also active in the field of education, leading the J.B. Damier Vocational School and founding the workshop-school bearing his name. Alongside his musical career, he worked for the recognition of copyright in Haiti, co-founding the National Association of Authors, Composers, and Performers of Music (ANACIM).\n\nHis musical career peaked with albums like \"Anakaona\" and \"Haïti Mélodie d'Amour,\" where his voice and compositions touched the hearts of listeners.

His passing on January 17, 1998, marked the end of a prolific career and the culmination of hard work.\n\nRaoul Guillaume, born on December 7, 1927, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, was destined for a life immersed in music. Born to Siéyès Guillaume and Francesca Hermantin, he inherited a rich musical heritage from his father, a talented trumpeter and the first Haitian mandolinist. His father's influence sparked Raoul's passion for music and set him on a path of musical exploration and innovation.\n\nGrowing up, Raoul attended Saint-Louis de Gonzague for both his primary and secondary education. It was here, under the guidance of Brother Léon, that his musical journey truly began. Encouraged by his father, Raoul embraced the alto saxophone and became integral to the school's brass band. During these formative years, he forged lifelong friendships with fellow musicians such as Nono Lamy, Guy Durosier, and Serge Lebon.\n\nAs he honed his skills, Raoul found himself drawn to the vibrant music scene of Port-au-Prince. Inspired by the performances of renowned musicians at the Champ de Mars bandstand, he delved deeper into the world of music, exploring various genres and styles.\n\nIn 1949, as Port-au-Prince celebrated its Bicentennial, Raoul's passion for music blossomed alongside the city's cultural renaissance. Alongside fellow musicians like Guy Durosier, he sought to preserve and promote Haiti's rich musical heritage, collecting and arranging songs that reflected the nation's soul.\n\nDespite the political turmoil that gripped Haiti in the following years, Raoul remained dedicated to his craft. Forced into exile in New York due to the oppressive regime, he continued to pursue his musical aspirations, forming a group and performing at various venues across the city. However, his outspokenness against the dictatorship led to a violent attack, resulting in a lengthy hospitalization.\n\nUpon his return to Haiti in 1972, Raoul embarked on a mission to revitalize the country's music scene. From operating gas stations to opening his accounting office, he never strayed far from his true passion. He created and directed the National Radio Orchestra, released numerous records, and championed young talent through music competitions sponsored by American Airlines.\n\nThroughout his life, Raoul Guillaume remained committed to his ultimate dream: preserving and promoting Haitian music on a global scale. His compositions, deeply rooted in the rhythms and themes of Haitian life, have been embraced by musicians worldwide.

They promote human values and are full of heart and passion. Many of his choral works, most with original poetry by his father Gabriel T. Guillaume, have fostered an awareness of the beautiful Haitian culture and continue to serve as an ambassador for his native country. In 2016, he was inducted into the 1804 List of Haitian-American Change Makers, a prestigious list named in honor of Haiti’s year of independence that “recognizes Haitian-Americans in the United States who have demonstrated outstanding achievement and success in their profession and proven themselves to be forces for change in their communities.” In 2017, he was honored by the top music school in Haiti for his “great contribution in the expansion and the promotion of the music and culture of Haiti around the world.”\n\nGuillaume’s compositions have been featured at numerous conferences and international festivals like the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA), the World Choir Games and Ireland’s Cork International Choral Festival.\n\nNearly all of his choral compositions have been commissioned works.

Coming from a family of four children, Dickens was raised in a household where music and religion held profound importance.\n\nHis familial connection to music was evident early, as his grandfather served as a clarinetist in the prestigious National Palace brass band. This legacy inspired Dickens to begin his musical journey as a cellist at seven. Over the years, his dedication and passion for music grew, leading him to master the double bass and electric bass guitar by age fifteen.\n\nDickens's musical education took him beyond Haiti's borders. Under the auspices of the American Embassy, he pursued training in various fields in the United States. During these ten years, he honed his skills and expanded his musical horizons, laying the foundation for a prolific music career.\n\nIn 1989, Dickens married Eveline Grégoire and became the proud father of two children, Leica Ellen and Paul Eddy. Despite his familial responsibilities, Dickens remained deeply committed to his musical pursuits, embarking on a multifaceted career encompassing roles as a musician, singer, professor, author, composer, arranger, and conductor.\n\nAlongside his academic pursuits in architecture, he imparted his knowledge and expertise as a cello and double bass instructor and one of the first Luthier music school graduates. For over forty years, Dickens dedicated himself to the musical section of Sainte Trinité School, where he served as a pillar of the institution's musical legacy, shaping the next generation of musicians.\n\nDickens's illustrious career saw him perform alongside renowned Haitian musical artists such as Ansy Dérose, Guy Durosier, Raoul Guillaume, and many others. His talents extended beyond instrumental proficiency, as he distinguished himself as a solo singer in esteemed choirs such as La Schola Cantorum, “Voice and Harmony.”\n\nIn addition to his performance endeavors, Dickens dedicated himself to music education as a music theory and singing instructor at the National School of Arts in Port-au-Prince. Despite encountering setbacks due to accidents on his left hand, he persevered, devoting himself to composition and mentoring young musicians.\n\nIn 2016, Dickens took the helm of his philharmonic orchestra, Melodick, comprising fifty musicians dedicated to showcasing his diverse musical repertoire with 20 varied music concert series. He celebrated his 50-year career and the 50th anniversary of the orchestra in several concerts with many of his pieces, such as Transition, Joyeux Noël, Meditation for flute and chamber orchestra, and Une Voix se tait, a tribute to the soprano Nicole Saint-Victor, who died in 2023. The philharmonic orchestra of Sainte Trinité interpreted these pieces.\n\nBeyond his musical endeavors, Dickens Princivil's artistic vision extended to photography and architecture. As the founder and director-general of the Musiphotart Cultural Center, he championed the intersection of music and visual arts, fostering cultural exchange and creativity within Haiti's artistic community.\n\nHis unwavering commitment to the arts earned him recognition as a cultural ambassador and goodwill ambassador of Port-au-Prince, affirming his enduring impact on Haiti's cultural landscape.\n\nBorn in Haiti on February 4, 1945, Julio Racine began his studies in solfeggio and flute at the age of 12.
