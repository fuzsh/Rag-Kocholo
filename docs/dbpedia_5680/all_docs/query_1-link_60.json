        "text": "The hauntingly brilliant folk-prog artist Dikajee has revealed a new video for her track 'Gloomy Flowers Blooming', featuring Faun's Fiona Rüggeberg, taken from her unique debut full-length album Forget~Me~Nots, out now.\n\nWatch here: https://youtu.be/GxJ250XzEA4\n\nPre-order Forget~Me~Nots here: dikajee.com\n\nThe artist comments: \"'Gloomy Flowers Blooming' is probably the most epic and the most \"really progressive\" song from the album. It is a trilogy that describes the process of surviving a grief experience. Whether it is the loss of loved ones, painful parting, or disappointment in life's ideals. The three parts \"The Sunset\", \"Rise all in silver\", and \"Gloomy Flowers Blooming\" are like my own musical stages of going through dark times. As a songwriter, I am happy that the song turned out to be both epic and intimate at the same time. The special shine of the song is Fiona Rüggeberg (FAUN, Tvinna); her bagpipe solo brings a breathtaking both Celtic folk (that I adore) and blues flare to the song. I am so happy to have Fiona on that song, she is an amazing musician with limitless talent. 'Gloomy Flowers Blooming' is a hail to everyone who is managing to reach the bottom, push off and rise all in silver, gloomy but stronger!\"\n\nSuch an esoteric, worldly approach is truly typical of this brilliant artist, and an album recorded throughout Europe, and with a truly international cadre and calibre of musician. Recording and producing in Norway, Portugal, Germany, France, Latvia, Russia, Forget~Me~Nots features guest appearances from Faun’s Fiona Rüggeberg (bagpipes), Klone’s Guillaume Bernard (guitars), Erik Truffaz's Artis Orubs (drums) and Amber Foil’s João Filipe (guitars) among others.\n\nThe international, collaborative outlook pays dividends across a record that showcases the best of folk, minimalist electronic, neo-baroque, neo-classical and truly inventive progressive rock. Above all else shines through Dikajee’s voice, a once-in-a-generation talent that recalls the best of Bjork and Kate Bush. Musically, shades of Steven Wilson, Nightwish, and Gentle Giant shine through.\n\nAcross Forget~Me~Nots Dikajee’s gloriously imaginative ethos is heard again and again. Track Four, ‘River Rite’, is a self-described “pagan ritual” song, which plays on the dual parables of the energy of floral wreaths, and of the wiseman by the river. The closing track, ‘Something Mystique’ is an exploration of the state of loss, and involved the visiting of more than ten abandoned grand estates of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.\n\nAn artist who previously toured Germany and Switzerland, opened for Yann Tiersen, Recoil (Depeche Mode’s Alan Wilder), and Nils Petter Molvær; and placed in Prog Magazine’s Top Unsigned Bands, Dikajee will deservedly have a bright and illustrious future.\n\ndikajee.com\n\ninstagram.com/dikajee\n\nfacebook.com/Dikajeepic"
