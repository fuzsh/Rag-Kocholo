        "text": "Excited to share our new soundtrack for \"DesiQuest\", a collaboration between me and Aalok Mehta. https://lnkd.in/gwwtQDef The show by EffinFunny Productions features an all South-Asian cast and an RPG story inspired by mythology from the Indian subcontinent. The team wanted the soundtrack to feature Indian ragas while being rooted in modern gaming soundtracks. They were interested in both me and Aalok, but neither of us could accomplish the vision alone. They asked us to figure it out together. We found we had complementary skills and musician networks and compatible musical ears. Here's what we found made for a successful collaboration (all happening to start with \"cr\"): Credit: No matter what, we shared it. Even in day to day emails with production we always made sure to say \"We\" and \"Us\". Critique: The hard part was not receiving honest feedback. It was giving it. A creative partner may hold back misgivings out of deference or politeness. If you sense that, draw it out. Crunch Time: When the deadline approaches, load balancing can make you far more efficient. One partner may be burned out on X while the other is burned out on Y. Trade tasks and you're both refreshed. On top of all that, working with a partner is fun. We're thrilled with the outcome, give a listen! #collaboration #musicproduction #soundtrack #filmmaking #musicsupervision #SouthAsian #Spotify #creativejourney #composers\n\nWho loves a bit of spice! Watch this video if you are looking to spice up your shots? üå∂Ô∏èüôÇ Simon from KITHERCo says, thinking about colour contrast in these two broad categories can help you to better plan your lighting in each scene! üí° Once you start thinking about lighting in this way, you‚Äôll start to see this in a lot of different shots! üéâ Both can be used to enhance the mood, feeling and tone of the script. (Or lyric of a music video) Have you tried this before? https://lnkd.in/ewUHJCsT\n\nOn The Art of Songwriting - I need a focus group. There is a time in every (music) project when things can change. A time when a different opportunity (sound, rhythm, style, interpretation) is presented that can alter the direction and flavour of a song. In many cases, after evaluating options, you stand firm, reject the notion. Or, make slight adjustments to suit. But recently, I was swayed. And although I like the change - and how the final sound of the song still fits nicely within the vibe of the Americana EP as a whole), in the digital world of *individual* streams, - What genre is this song? Classifying songs ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù offers the best chance for success. Options: -Americana, country, rock, pop Post your answers below & let me know!! https://lnkd.in/ga7_6AyN #focusgroup, #songfocusgroup, #youropinionmatters, #musicgenre, #whatgenreisthissong, #indiangypsymusic, #_shawtymom_, #canadianna, #musicnews, #musiccolumn, #musicnews\n\nGentle music is one way you can calm your central nervous system after a long day. Listening is a great way to reset the tone after a stressful event and between your daily transitions. Finding music that speaks to your soul can be so refreshing, even lowering your BP while helping to break up intrusive thoughts. Continue to try new tools that will allow you to manage stress and be your best self... #DamienEscobar\n\nPrecision and Spontaneity ‚Äì The Signature Of A-List Stars! üòÆüòÆüòÆ One of the qualities I've embraced in recent months is the practice of not just enjoying music, shows, or films, but also asking myself questions like: \"What makes a show/film so captivating? Why do they succeed in this way? How do they express emotions? Or handle interviews so smoothly? What skills have they mastered for success? And so on\". What surprised me is realizing that captivating shows and great films often come from directors, actors, and teams who embrace both precision and spontaneity. Particularly, the ability to distinguish A-list stars lies in their professionalism in managing spontaneity. In a short time, they can create a compelling song with smooth melodies. This combination of precision and spontaneity often arises from the smallest details, not necessarily grand gestures. \"Intense focus + Precision + Passion + a touch of spontaneity\" consistently produce impressive results.
