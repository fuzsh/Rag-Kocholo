        "text": "We don't know much about Guillaume Grand's childhood, except that it was punctuated by moves linked to his father's transfers. The singer retained from these incessant moves a taste for adventure, discovery and travel, whether lived or dreamed.\n\nAs a young songwriter, guitarist and performer, Guillaume Grand accumulated songs in his drawers and concerts in his luggage. Signing with a major label led to the recording of his debut album, L' Amour Est Laid, preceded by the single Toi et moi, which enjoyed a wave of popularity on the net.\n\nIn addition to his raspy voice and lyrics with a real-life flavour, Guillaume Grand adorns his songs with violin, piano or harmonica, sometimes pop, sometimes rock, depending on the mood. L'Amour Est Laid hit record stores on October 4, 2010, with the young artist rumored to be one of the hottest new talents on the French music scene.\n\nÂ©Copyright Music Story 2024"
