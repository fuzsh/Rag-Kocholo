        "text": "A couple of suggestions:\n\nOverall, Jean-Jacques Goldman is probably one of the most successful singers who has spanned several decades; many of the songs are in a ballad style so the pronunciation is quite clear (and like most singers he also went through an 80s \"pop\" phase). His compilation Singulier has a wide mix of styles, including the song \"Comme Toi\" which was particularly famous. His later albums are also worth listening to, though.\n\nIn the mid 90s, Céline Dion worked with Jean-Jacques Goldman, including the album D'Eux, and her work was momentarily a bit less cheesy (and in French).\n\nCheck out Patrick Fiori, who has a vaguely similar style to Goldman (sorry, I see I don't have a biography up for him, but I guess there must be stuff in Wikipedia)\n\nI think you can add to your list :\n\n- Daniel Balavoine\n\n- Alain Souchon\n\n- Laurent Voulzy\n\n- Jean Louis Aubert (and his old band Telephone)\n\n- Benabar (he may be sing a little bit too fast)\n\n- Francis Cabrel (singer with a south accent)\n\n- Georges Brassens (old singer with a south accent)\n\nSorry, no women in my list and no biography but as Neil said you can find stuff in Wikipedia .\n\nThanks Erwan. With some of these, you might need to be a bit more selective about which songs you choose for a 13 year old (but you will certainly find many that are suitable I think).\n\nI have a little bio up about Bénabar, who I like a lot but think many of his songs might be too difficult.\n\nI also like Christophe Maé and \"Monsieur Clément\", but again, you might need to be selective about songs.\n\nOh wow! That is possibly the single best internet resource for language learning I have found! The fact that they make a game out of it will be motivating. I went through a song twice, and each time it had different blanks to fill in.\n\nI only wish there was a way to just play the song through with the lyrics.\n\nEdit: Okay, I discovered \"karaoke\" mode, where the lyrics just scroll by. Some of the translations are quite funny, I assume they're just made by software. \"Près d’ici ou là-bas\" comes out as \"Prs dici or below\". Google translate says it means \"Near here or there\". Is that accurate?\n\nI started a French radio station in the U.S. in January 2011, which plays French language popular music for language learners. You may want to browse our playlist. I try to feature everything from traditional Chansons Francaises to exotic heavy rock of Indochine and Dionysos.\n\nHere's a list of a few recommended songs that have a catchy tune and relative straightforward and well-pronounced lyrics:\n\n1) Joe le Taxi by Vanessa Paradis\n\n2) Le Temps des Cerises by Cora Vaucaire\n\n3) Le Jardin Extraordinaire by Charles Trenet\n\n4) Les Champs-Elysees by Joe Dassin\n\nand finally a Christmas song by the France's answer to Elvis Presley...\n\n5) Noel Interdit by Johnny Hallyday\n\nHope that helps!
