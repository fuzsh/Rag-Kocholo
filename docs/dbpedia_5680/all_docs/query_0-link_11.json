Conveniently at your door What was worth looking for What is worth looking for\n\n6.\n\nInterlude 03:12\n\n7.\n\nMélodisorientation 04:34\n\nMélodisorientation Ma mélodisorientation Ma mélodie Ma mélodisorientation Oh mélodie Disorient me Overwhelm me Oh Invade me Come and find me Come and find me All around me Oh it seems That you are here Oh it feels That I can’t breath Oh it seems That you are here As I stand still (x2) Ma mélodisorientation Ma mélodie Ma mélodisorientation Oh mélodie Oh it seems That you are here Oh it feels That I can’t breath Oh it seems You are here As I stand still (X2) Ma mélodisorientation Ma mélodie Ma mélodisorientation Oh mélodie Come and find me Overwhelm me Disorient me All around me Come and find me Overwhelm me Disorient me All around me\n\n8.\n\nMighty Gifts 03:36\n\nMighty gifts Rooting Enjoying my time I think I am finding All my colours back again A bit of uncertainty But feeling lucky Everyday is a blessing Having you around A sort of homecoming Will I see you again? Find the time to (Re)discover you and me my friends It’s been a long time So long to see Years of wondering How it could ever be But I rooted down here Oh gravity Is pushing on me In a cycle of joy and fear Rooting Enjoying my time And I am wondering Are you really all mine? A bit of sympathy But I am not so blind It’s about who we are And what we are meant to be It’s been a long time So long to see Years of wondering About things that ought to be And I rooted down here Oh gravity Is pushing on me In a cycle of joy and fear And I won’t forget I’ll be there to set This rocky lift With all of us My mighty gifts Yes I’ll be there to feel The light From all of us With joy and cheer My mighty gifts With joy and cheer My mighty gifts With joy and cheer My mighty gifts\n\n9.\n\nIf I could 02:55\n\nIf I could I wish I could flow Rhythm between I wish I could blow My layers within Underneath my skin Underneath Over and over Cycles of war Down under Your call For many more Battles to the core To the core If I could Let it go If I could Change it all If I could If I could Would you let me know Would you let me? I wish I could mellow My layers within I wish I could float My body breathing Time to save it all Time to save it Underneath Underneath my skin The truth within Colours shaping Underneath my skin Underneath If I could Let it go If I could Change it all If I could If I could Would you let me know Would you let me? If I could Change it all If I could Just let it go If I could If I could Would you let me know Would you let me? Underneath my skim It burns It burns Underneath my skin To the core To the core Underneath my skim It burns It burns Underneath my skin To the core To the core Underneath\n\n10.\n\nMama Sate 03:30\n\nMama Sate Yes I could not resist My heart Just like a twist Calling you On the other side Of the world A very special call A very special time Falling into love And tears Washing away My heart-break feel Yes, I could not resist The temptation Calling me Right at the bottom Of my soul Of my soul Yes I could not resist My heart Just like a twist Calling you Oh I know I would always need you My love Here and now Yes, I could not resist The temptation Calling me Right at the bottom Of my soul Of my soul\n\n11.\n\nInto the Blue 04:24"
