        "text": "Who are today’s best French singers? The French-speaking world has much to offer across lots of different genres.\n\nWhether you’re learning the language or studying the culture before a trip abroad, or you’re just your average Francophile in love with all things français, keep reading to find out who’s who on the modern French music scene in Pop, Folk, Rock, Rap, Gypsy Jazz, and Dance. Learn about artists and sample their music. With lots of styles and genres, you’re sure to find something you like.\n\nTo help with your music discovery, I’ve also included similar artists for you to check out — some of whom have have been featured on this site.\n\nStromae\n\nThis Belgian Dance artist is the unlikeliest of stars, but he’s all anyone’s been talking about since he released his sophomore album in 2013.\n\nHis debut single “Alors on Danse” was ubiquitous when unleashed upon Europe in 2010. It featured monotone verses that sounded like he’d rather be anywhere but in the recording studio, and a catchy, horn-infused track that was more 90’s House than EDM. With it, he tapped into the despondent mood of the recession-struck continent.\n\nHis musical genius is on full display on his second album, featuring styles ranging from Dance to Congolese Rumba. And as always, his videos just take things to another level. Stromae’s the most exciting thing to happen to French-language music in a long time.\n\nCarla Bruni\n\nYou can’t have a list of French singers without including the sweetly husky Carla Bruni. On paper, she could easily be dismissed. She’s half-Italian, an heiress, and a former model who married the President of France. None of these things would predispose her to being taken seriously as a French musician. Yet, when she picked up a pen and guitar (and snagged herself with a top-notch producer), magic happened.\n\nHer debut album Quelqu’un m’a dit was praised by critics and fans alike for its delicate, intimate songs that had the vibe of whispered poetry. A perennial favorite, Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy has had each of her 4 albums reach number 1 or 2 on the charts.\n\n(Similar Artists: Rose)\n\nJulien Doré\n\nThe reality show winner and sex symbol is like that hot Art major you know (or used to know back in the day). He’s delightfully weird and seemingly unaffected by his hype.\n\nI’m not even sure that he deserved to win Nouvelle Star. He was only there to get publicity for his unsigned Rock band, but the judges were so in thrall by his gender-bending takes on girly Pop hits like “Moi…Lolita,” “Like a Virgin”, and “Baby One More Time” that they couldn’t help themselves.\n\nHis music can be a bit challenging, but you can always count on this former film student for a memorable video that gets lots of buzz. His latest album LØVE is his most accessible one to date, so if you’re looking to explore his catalog, start there.\n\nZaz\n\nThe bohemian singer with Paris cabaret cred burst onto the scene in 2010 with her monster hit, “Je Veux.” With it, she helped usher in a Gypsy Jazz revival and drove a banner year for international French music sales. She sounded like no one else who was out at the time, and was quickly heralded as the new Edith Piaf. With a down-to-earth style and a delightfully raspy voice, Zaz is the kind of performer who would sound good singing the phone book.\n\nShe’s been featured on the Hugo soundtrack and the Generation Goldman Vol. 1 album, which showcases today’s brightest young stars, and she released her highly anticipated sophomore album Recto Verso in 2013.\n\n(Similar Artists: Melissa Nkonda, Carmen Maria Vega)\n\nJoyce Jonathan\n\nBefore she became tabloid fodder by dating the son of the French President, this sunny singer-songwriter grabbed the spotlight at the tender age of 20 with hummable, feel-good Pop. Her acoustic guitar strumming and happy melodies remind me very much of Colbie Caillat, and her debut album Sur Mes Gardes is a classic in my book.\n\nCorneille\n\nYou may have seen his name or come across his CDs while music shopping, since this artist made a deliberate attempt to penetrate the insular U.S. market. In the French-speaking world, Corneille (pronounced Kor-NAY) is the beloved, smooth crooning Acoustic Pop/Soul singer whose beautiful music often belies the pain he endured as a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. His first two albums are classics, and his current music still tops the charts.\n\n(Similar Artists: Marc Antoine)\n\nVanessa Paradis\n\nOften in the headlines as a model, one-half of a (former) Hollywood couple with Johnny Depp, and an all-around “it” girl, Vanessa Paradis navigated the tough transition from teen starlet to adult singer. After some utterly forgettable early albums (everything pre-Divine Idylle), she seems to have found her groove. Her latest project should silence all critics — it shows the depth she was capable of all along. Masterfully produced by Benjamin Biolay, it’s her best work yet.\n\nCoeur de Pirate\n\nThe indie darling from Montreal became a superstar in France and beyond when she released her debut album in 2010. Her appeal lies in her clever songs, childlike voice, and piano Pop melodies. (Think Regina Spektor with tattoos.) She’s got a hipster following, so you’ll often see her English cover songs, side projects, and what not being blogged about like it’s the best thing since sliced bread. And it usually is.\n\nShe’s got plenty of new projects out in 2014 — enough to keep any CdP fan happy.\n\n(Similar artists: Marie Pierre Arthur, Chloe Lacasse, Fanny Bloom)\n\nLa Fouine\n\nThis veteran rapper’s versatility has played a huge role in his success. He’s adept at appealing to multiple audiences via raw street anthems that address but don’t glorify violence, as well as introspective, heartfelt songs, a la Eminem. His biography reads like that of a typical rapper from the ‘hood — save the part where he studied music theory, singing and learned to play multiple instruments at a conservatory.\n\nOver the course of 5 albums and numerous mixtapes/street albums, his music education has helped set him apart with a unique brand of melodic Hip Hop hits.\n\nCheck out his latest:\n\nBB Brunes\n\nYou could call these guys the French ‘Strokes’ for shorthand. While other French bands choose to sing in English (Phoenix, Plastiscines) or go Electronic (M83, Daft Punk) in order to reach a broader audience, BB Brunes has won acclaim while still performing in their native tongue.\n\nInspired by 90’s Brit Pop and the New Wave Revival bands of the early 2000’s, these childhood friends put out catchy Rock music that gets better with each album. Their second and third albums should be added to your list of must-have imports.\n\n(Similar Artists: Chinatown, Plastiscines, Naast, Les Shades)\n\n*** BONUS ARTIST ***\n\nLa Femme\n\nIf BB Brunes is too mainstream for you, try the Gothic New Wave Surf Rock band La Femme. After some indie success and in the aftermath of a record label bidding war, they released their debut album in 2013. With a creepy-by-design sound they’ve dubbed “Psycho Tropical Berlin” and a rotating crop of lead female singers, this oddball Rock band has become the unsung hero of the French music scene."
