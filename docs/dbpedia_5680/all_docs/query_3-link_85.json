        "text": "When Sertorius de Rima learned from the back of his stall that one of the stars of the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games was an iron and silver horse galloping down the Seine, the 14-year-old bay smiled with delight. Finally, the top of the bill! Finally, a tribute to the only animals in the competition! Horse-riding, the world's stables are forever neighing, is a pair affair: a human and a horse, both top-level athletes. Commentators all too often forget this.\n\nIn France, boomers remember Pierre Jonquères d'Oriola, one of the most successful French riders. But who can name Pomone, the mare with which he became world show jumping champion in 1966? Nobody, apart from a few aficionados.\n\nMounts rarely go down in history. Fortunately, in 2013, Canadian director Christian Duguay made a feature-length film about a black devil called Jappeloup, mocked for his fickleness during competitions. Defying the odds, this champion won gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics under the saddle of Pierre Durand, played by Guillaume Canet.\n\nThanks to a prodigious trigger, Jappeloup soared above the obstacles. Sertorius, on the other hand, is a star dancer. He loves pirouettes and cadenced steps to music. With Pauline Basquin, his rider at the Cadre Noir in Saumur (western France), the slender gelding succeded in the Olympic dressage qualifier on Wednesday, July 31.\n\nThe light, airy duet – you can hardly hear them touch the ground – represents France's best chance of a medal in this ultra-sophisticated discipline, dominated by the Germans and English. Basquin is 12th in the International Equestrian Federation rankings.\n\nIn the manner of Montaigne\n\nLike Jappeloup, Sertorius is a real standout. \"His story is astonishing,\" said Jean Morel, coach of the French dressage team, in an emotional voice, \"this horse is exceptional.\" The subtext is clear: He too deserves a film.\n\nSertorius was born on May 27, 2010 in northwestern Mayenne, at a place called Sainte-Marie (\"Rima\" in slang), from which he takes his particle surname: Sertorius de Rima. His dam, Siolota, is a black Dutch mare. His sire, a stallion named Sandro Hit, is a former world dressage champion. This heartbreaker has impregnated a host of females by artificial insemination.\n\n\"Sertorius was a magnificent colt,\" said Marine Ferté, the breeder behind his birth. \"On the other hand, as a teenager, he was rather ugly but already super-nice, even if he was a bit of a bully in the meadow.\" In other words, he nibbled his friends. Admittedly, with the tip of his teeth, but still."
