Guillaume Farley is a French musician who refuses to be confined by any particular musical genre. With a career spanning decades, he has collaborated with an impressive array of artists including Paco Sery, Richard Gotainer, Youssou N’dour, Juan Rozoff, Faudel, Amel Bent, Sapho, Albert Magister, Grand Corps Malade, Michel Fugain, Booster, Matthieu Chedid, Sandra Nkake and many more. Farley’s diverse musical interests have helped him carve out a unique space in the French music scene.

From an early age, Farley was a showman, and it was his first heartbreak at age 13 that led him to spend countless hours in his room. Rather than writing poetry or drowning his sorrows, he picked up an electric bass guitar and poured his emotions into his music. This set the tone for his future career in music, as he would go on to become a prolific bassist, guitarist, and composer.

Farley’s passion for all types of love stories led to the creation of the duo Naturalibus, which he formed with Hélène Mittet (with whom he had already collaborated in the groups Ich Bin Wallou and Pareil Mais Plus). Over the course of seven years, Naturalibus became a unique presence in the French music scene, performing all over France and opening for artists such as Vanessa Paradis, Julie Ferrier, and Thomas Dutronc.

Farley’s music is energetic and rhythmic, reflecting his own dynamic personality. His songs often oscillate between light and heavy, between frivolity and gravity, and between glitz and simplicity. He refuses to be tied down to any particular style or label, instead embracing the inherent unpredictability of his musical career.

In a world where it’s all too easy to conform to established musical genres and trends, Guillaume Farley stands out as a true original. His insatiable curiosity and passion for music ensure that his fans will continue to be surprised and delighted by his work for years to come.
