Ben Moody, guitarist of We Are The Fallen, started out as the co-founder of the alternative rock band, Evanescence. After leaving in October 2003 during the European tour, he moved on to a solo project and began producing songs for other artists.

The list includes Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, Lindsay Lohan, Bo Bice, Godhead, 3Faced, Daughtry and Celine Dion. He has also been producing, writing and touring with singer-songwriter Hana Pestle.

Ben has released songs on both The Punisher and Fantastic Four soundtracks (the former also features fellow Evanescence co-founder, Amy Lee performing with Seether).On Tuesday December 16, 2008 he released his Mutiny Bootleg EP, which came free with a copy of Hana Pestle's EP that night.

Moody is quoted as saying "there’s a duet between Hana and I on there that won't be on the record and won’t be released anywhere ever again. It’s free because I want this sh*t spread everywhere, so be sure that all your friends share the four songs with as many people as possible!" The EP is therefore available for free download from http://drop.
