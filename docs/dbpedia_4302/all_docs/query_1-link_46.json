        "text": "Evanescence\n\nMain article: Evanescence\n\nIn 1994, Moody met Amy Lee in Little Rock, Arkansas while at a youth camp. The two became musical collaborators and co-founded Evanescence.[6][4] They soon began playing music at local shops.[7] Within a few years, the duo began selling EPs at local shows, culminating in their discovery by Wind-up Records and the release of their debut studio album, Fallen, in 2003. Moody abruptly left Evanescence in October 2003 during their European tour, citing creative differences.[8][9]\n\nIn 2006, Moody signed with former Evanescence management Rider Management, which sued him in 2013 for $500,000 in unpaid commissions.[10]\n\nIn August 2010, Moody released a statement on his history with Lee and Evanescence, where he said that he was a different person at the time, his friendship with Lee had deteriorated, and they had conflicting opinions, personalities, and desires with the band. Moody apologized to Lee for comments he made to her in anger. He said he realized the band would end if he stayed and believes he made the right choice. He added, \"Evanescence has progressed a great distance from the original sound, and made it clear that they intended to expand much further. Amy is very artistic and never has had a problem thinking outside of the box and defying expectations.\"[11]\n\nSolo projects\n\nBeginning in 2004, Moody began collaborating with several artists, co-writing the track \"Nobody's Home\" for Avril Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, and co-writing the track \"The End Has Come\" with Jason C. Miller and Jason \"Gong\" Jones for The Punisher soundtrack. He then wrote with David Hodges, Kelly Clarkson, and others for Clarkson's second album, Breakaway, working on the songs \"Because of You\" and \"Addicted\".[12]\n\nIn early 2005, Moody played lead guitar for the song \"Forever in Our Hearts\", the 'song for tsunami relief' made exclusively for iTunes.[13] He collaborated with singer Anastacia on the song \"Everything Burns\", which is featured on her album Pieces of a Dream and the Fantastic Four soundtrack. Moody then assisted Lindsay Lohan on her album A Little More Personal (Raw) and worked with Bo Bice on the song \"My World\" (a cover from SR-71) for his debut album The Real Thing. Moody's debut solo album, You Can't Regret What You Don't Remember, was scheduled to be released in late 2005, and would feature bassist Marty O'Brien on bass, drummer Lance Garvin, guitarist Michael \"Fish\" Herring, and co-vocals from Jason Miller.[14]\n\nIn April 2006, Moody began working on the debut album of singer-songwriter Hana Pestle, co-producing and co-writing with Michael \"Fish\" Herring, as well as performing on the album.[15] He later produced the Godhead album The Shadow Line with Julian Beeston, and played a clown in their music video for the song \"Push\". He collaborated with Hodges again on American Idol Chris Daughtry's debut album, Daughtry (2006), for the song \"What About Now\".\n\nIn 2007, Moody worked with Celine Dion on her album Taking Chances.[15] It was reported that his solo album was still in the works.[15]\n\nIn December 2008, he released the Mutiny Bootleg E.P. and announced that his solo album would be released on March 3, 2009. This release would be delayed, however, as was hinted at in February 2009, when Moody's official website displayed the release as \"available 2009\" instead of the March 3 release date. On June 9, 2009, Moody's debut solo album, entitled All for This, was released digitally via Amazon.com, iTunes, and Amie Street through Moody's label, FNR Records. His second album, You Can't Regret What You Don't Remember, was released on November 11, 2011.\n\nOther bands\n\nIn June 2009, it was announced that Moody had formed the rock band called We Are the Fallen, recruiting American Idol 7 finalist Carly Smithson as the lead singer, and his friends former Evanescence drummer Rocky Gray, guitarist John LeCompt, and Marty O'Brien on bass.[16][17] We Are the Fallen made their first public appearance together for a press conference at SIR Studios in Los Angeles, CA, on June 22, 2009. Their debut album, Tear the World Down was released in May 2010. The band toured for most of the year in support of the album, and filmed their first live DVD, Cirque Des Damn√©s, at the Avalon Theatre. The DVD was scheduled for release in late 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Moody teamed up with former Papa Roach drummer Dave Buckner, and former Rock Star Supernova frontman Lukas Rossi, to form a new band called The Halo Method. Before their debut show on the Shiprocked cruise in November 2012, former In This Moment bassist and studio engineer Josh Newell became their bassist."
