We are accustomed to encountering Shakespeare in the spelling and punctuation of our own time but with the other features remaining in Early Modern English, as in the Modern Critical Edition of the New Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works and other modern editions. This Critical Reference Edition sets aside this convenient but artificial separation, and preserves the full array of linguistic features to be found in the earliest texts on which the New Oxford Shakespeare is based. It aims to bring today’s reader as close as is possible in an edited text to the form in which Shakespeare’s works would have been encountered by his earliest readers. This edition preserves the ambiguities of language and thought in the more amorphous early modern forms in which they were first created and presented. This edition rejects the heavy standardization of names and wording and the extensive provision of editorial stage directions that have been typical of modern-spelling editions since the eighteenth century. It favours instead the rich variability in the way roles were originally identified, and presents the original stage directions that, for all their diversity, cryptic intention, and unevenness, were the effective foundation for performance in Shakespeare’s theatres. This edition reflects the documents. Most immediately these are usually printed texts, but the characteristic traits of scribes, annotators, and even Shakespeare himself can often be discerned behind them. These documents are foregrounded as historical entities, as they were manufactured, as they circulated, and as they were read. This edition also highlights editorial process, including the correction of error. All early modern texts contain errors and variants. The notes record textual variants and explain editorial decisions. We have sought to make the textual apparatus as transparent and accessible as possible. The Textual Introduction to each work situates it within the early modern book trade, attending to the printers and the publishers of individual texts. It also identifies Shakespeare’s sources in terms of the actual editions that he is likely to have read. We foreground Shakespeare both as a producer and a consumer of early modern texts, and the agency of early modern theatre practitioners, scribes, publishers, and printers as well as later editors in mediating them to their publics. These aims would have been self-evidently desirable to generations of editors for whom any modern-spelling edition was a second-best compromise, as is witnessed by the foundational original-spelling editions in the twentieth century of Thomas Nashe, Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker, John Webster, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, and other early modern dramatists. But, apart from the unannotated Oxford edition of 1987, the original-spelling Shakespeare edition has been conspicuous by its absence. Our aim has been to provide an essential work of reference for twenty-first century scholars and students, and for all readers interested in the history of Shakespeare’s texts. We therefore offer here a fully edited, annotated, and contextualized edition of v\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 5\n\n09/03/2017 11:38\n\ngeneral editors’ preface\n\nShakespeare in a form that is close to that of the original documents, whilst linking it through shared line numbering and notes on issues of linguistic modernization to the Modern Critical Edition that it complements. This Critical Reference Edition provides the historical and textual foundation for the Modern Critical Edition; it does not impose a particular critical or theatrical interpretation on any of the works. The Modern edition, in turn, provides explanatory commentary, performance notes, and critical histories. This Reference edition arranges Shakespeare’s works in the chronological order of the surviving documents; the Modern edition is instead organized by what we believe is the chronological order of composition. These issues of chronology, and the larger issues of authorship to which they are connected, are fully explored in the Authorship Companion. Our institutional and professional acknowledgements are recorded in the Modern Critical Edition; all of them apply to the present edition as well. We add here our profound gratitude to all those who have been involved with the New Oxford Shakespeare at Oxford University Press. These include the project manager Claire Thompson; marketing manager Phil Henderson; Rupert Mann and Marcos Sanmamed as developers of the OSEO platform; Jonathan Bargus, who came up with original and elegant design solutions to our complex editorial demands; and Eleanor Collins, Clare Jones, and Rachel Platt. Jacqueline Norton has vigorously and actively supported the project from earliest proposals to publication, deploying her authority, diplomacy, energy, and care whenever they were needed. The hero of the project who would be unsung were it not for this acknowledgement is Kathleen Fearn. She oversaw us as editors and supervised the copy editing and proof-reading schedules through an intensive eighteen-month period of rolling file submission and correction, during which her efforts were tireless and unceasing, her understanding of our aims and methods was unmatched, and her professionalism, tact, and patience were almost unassailable. This edition would have been poorer, and later published, had it not been for her. Its faults, of course, remain our own. These volumes are dedicated to the originator of the landmark 1986–7 Oxford Shakespeare, and our greatest and wisest Shakespearean, Sir Stanley Wells.

It replaces the Oxford Shakespeare of 1986–7 with a single, fully and freshly prepared text based on new editorial premises. It is designed from the outset to be published both in print and as a digital Online Edition as part of Oxford Scholarly Editions Online. The Complete Works is published in two complementary formats: original spelling (Critical Reference) and modern spelling (Modern Critical). The Complete Works is supplemented, in print and digital format, by an edition of Alternative Versions, which will bring together for the first time all the significantly variant texts. An Authorship Companion volume addresses the a priori question of what Shakespeare wrote, with whom, and when, and so underpins all statements on these issues in the present volumes. The Critical Reference Edition takes as a precedent the old-spelling edition published alongside the modern-spelling Oxford Shakespeare of 1986–7. However, in contrast with that edition it provides a full apparatus. A Textual Introduction at the beginning of each text describes the primary document(s) on which the text is based, and places it or them within a broader context of textual production. Textual Notes, Lineation Notes, and supplementary Marginal Notes appear on the same page as the text itself. This is therefore a fully realized and free-standing edition in its own right, and indeed the first such original-spelling edition of Shakespeare’s complete works ever to have been prepared. The present edition is more conservatively edited than its 1986–7 antecedent. This is most readily apparent in the treatment of stage directions, which replicate those of the copy text unless the editor argues for an error of textual transmission. Thus the characterizing features of the source documents are preferred over the practices of regularization that typify the Shakespeare editorial tradition. In the text as a whole, the presence of error is clearly displayed. Departures from copy text are marked either through the use of brackets for the correction of error or through the presentation of added or deleted text in specially designed text boxes. Although fully edited, the edition preserves the original spelling and punctuation as far as possible, in a form close to that of its original documentary foundation, and with full recognition of the extreme variability of early modern practices, both within documents and between them. As most of Shakespeare’s works do not survive in manuscript, the immediate source text is almost always a printed book. The edition’s apparatus is alert to the materiality of the text, to the history of textual culture, and to the human and technical agencies of textual transmission. This Critical Reference Edition is a means to understanding Shakespeare as a body of texts situated within an early modern textual culture of writing, reproduction, and reading. Volume 1 deals with the works first published in Shakespeare’s lifetime, arranged by the order in which they were\n\nxxiii\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 23\n\n09/03/2017 11:38\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition published. Volume 2 turns to the posthumous works, and includes an introductory essay by Gary Taylor on the 1623 Folio edition of Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies.\n\nDOCUMENTARY FOU NDATIONS The first task of the editor is to determine the canon: that is to say, to decide which works should be included in the edition, and which texts most fully represent them. The present edition extends the groundbreaking initiative of the 1986–7 Oxford Shakespeare in making the determination of the canon and the definition of different authorial contributions in collaborative plays a key task and a distinguishing feature of the edition. The importance of these issues is reflected in our treatment of them at length in the dedicated Authorship Companion volume. We are mostly but not entirely dependent on print for the text of Shakespeare’s works. But some poems survive in manuscript, and the manuscript play Sir Thomas More contains the only literary penmanship thought to be in Shakespeare’s own hand. Regarded as a body of texts on which the present-day editor can draw, Shakespeare divides into three:\n\n1. The First Folio of 1623. This posthumous publication stands apart as a large and prestigious book that signals to its readers a claim to bring together all of Shakespeare’s dramatic works in authoritative form under the aegis of Shakespeare as sole originator. As will become evident, all these claims are deeply questionable. The Folio was reprinted in 1632, 1663–4, and 1685. 2. The remaining early print witnesses. These make up an extensive and diverse field of quarto and occasional smaller octavo books issued over several decades starting in 1592 (Arden of Faversham) by numerous different publishers. The smaller print formats are eminently suitable for single plays. They also provide source texts for a major field of Shakespearean writing excluded from the Folio, the narrative poems and the Sonnets. The editions of plays up to 1597 did not identify an author; the naming of Shakespeare became usual from that year onwards. 3. A small number of manuscripts. Most notable is the manuscript of the collaborative play Sir Thomas More, which was not published in print until the twentieth century. Some of Shakespeare’s Sonnets also survive in manuscript as well as in their 1609 quarto edition.\n\nThe second and third groups of texts expand the Folio corpus of Shakespeare along two distinct axes: they lengthen the catalogue of Shakespeare’s works, and they diversify the textual forms in which those works present themselves. These ancillary texts bring into the canon all the poems, and also various plays written by Shakespeare in collaboration with other dramatists. Some of the diversification of textual forms depends merely on the fact that no two early modern editions are ever identical; to a varying degree, each is a designed artefact, and each is subject to error. Other texts are different in the more purposeful sense that they are based on a manuscript that cannot have been the same as the one on which the Folio equivalent is based. In these cases the variant texts can often be regarded as separate versions. The Folio itself gives no indication that any of the plays it contains might be anything other than written wholly by Shakespeare. However, it includes plays such as the Henry VI trilogy which Shakespeare composed in collaboration, and plays such as Macbeth which, though written by Shakespeare, were subsequently adapted by Thomas Middleton to make the version appearing in the Folio. Nevertheless, all the Folio plays have a secure place in an edition of Shakespeare. On the assumption that collaboratively written plays as well as sole-authored plays should be included, the Folio therefore establishes a core canon of thirty-six dramatic works. We are entirely dependent on this book for the survival of half of these plays, including major canonical works such as Twelfth Night, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Tempest. But the other half of the Folio plays had been published earlier in individual small-format editions. There are also quarto editions of plays that were not included in the Folio, probably because they were written in collaboration by Shakespeare and other dramatists. Finally, the eighteenth-century Shakespeare editor Lewis Theobald advertised his\n\nxxiv\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 24\n\n09/03/2017 11:38\n\nTHE PLAY IN THE THEATRE Double Falsehood as an adaptation based on Cardenio, a recorded but otherwise lost collaboration between Shakespeare and John Fletcher. The sole-authored works for which the Folio found no space are confined to the non-dramatic work that it made no claim to represent: principally Venus and Adonis, Lucrece, and the Sonnets and ‘A Lover’s Complaint’. Other short poems have been attributed to Shakespeare with varying degrees of certainty. These are discussed in the section of this edition headed ‘Poems attributed to Shakespeare in the seventeenth-century miscellanies’ and in Authorship Companion, 218–30. A review of the Shakespeare canon that begins with the Folio and reaches out from there to the ancillary canon therefore fades to a region where collaboration reduces the Shakespearean content, and combines with misattribution and anonymity in the original documents. The New Oxford Shakespeare reaches a number of new conclusions about collaboration and adaptation in Shakespeare’s plays, often on the basis of recent research by the editors and members of the edition’s attribution advisory group.\n\nMANUSCR IPT CULTUR E Before the inception of print, transcription by scribes was the method by which texts were copied and so circulated to new readers. In Shakespeare’s time scribal publication remained an important element of textual culture (see Love; Woudhuysen; Beal, In Praise; Roberts). The theatre was itself a major arena for the production of manuscripts. Plays might also be copied and passed on to patrons or friends: Humphrey Moseley, the publisher of the 1647 folio collection of plays attributed to Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, noted that ‘when private friends desir’d a Copy, they then (and justly too) transcribed what they Acted’.1 Thomas Middleton’s The Witch survives in a manuscript in the hand of Ralph Crane, with a dedicatory epistle to Thomas Holmes in the hand of Middleton himself.2 Crane, a professional scribe who worked for the King’s Men in the later Jacobean period, prepared manuscripts of several Shakespeare plays that became the printer’s copy for the 1623 Folio. Of Shakespeare’s non-dramatic verse, the two long narrative poems, both dedicated to the Earl of Southampton, were written and prepared for the medium of print in which they flourished. In Palladis Tamia (1598), Francis Meres cited Venus and Adonis and Lucrece as evidence that ‘the sweet wittie soule of Ouid liues in the mellifluous & hony-tongued Shakespeare’. But his Sonnets were of a different kind. In 1598 most readers would not have been able to confirm whether these Ovidian qualities were also to be found in what Meres called Shakespeare’s ‘sugred Sonnets among his priuate friends’ (281–2). Only in 1609 did the Sonnets appear in print. Variant texts circulated in seventeenth-century miscellanies, copied either from the 1609 quarto with subsequent alteration, or from the earlier manuscripts of the 1590s. Textual alteration and the recombination of poems by different authors in changing sequences are typical of manuscript circulation.\n\nTHE PLAY IN THE THEATR E Plays were written in manuscripts, and performed from manuscripts. The texts of Shakespeare’s plays depend on the habits of scribes and theatre practitioners even before being released to a publisher for issuing in print. The hypothetical range of characteristics in a printer’s copy manuscript is considerable. Over the past century editors have strived to correlate the surviving mostly nonShakespearean manuscripts with the Shakespearean printed texts. They have had mixed success. The twentieth-century ‘New Bibliographers’ introduced a dichotomy between ‘foul papers’ (the author’s initial full draft before it was processed in the theatre) and the ‘promptbook’.3 The present editors agree with Paul Werstine that the term ‘foul papers’ is over-specific. There is no evidence 1 ‘The Stationer to the Reader’, sig. A4r. 2 Bodleian MS. Malone 12. See F. P. Wilson’s Malone Society Reprints transcript. 3 Most influential were Pollard, Shakespeare Folios and Quartos and Shakespeare’s Fight.

Nevertheless, the surviving transcripts necessarily had antecedents that, though now lost, must once have existed, and it cannot be assumed that all authorial drafts were automatically annotated before they were copied. Annotated or not, such manuscripts might sometimes have served as printer’s copy. The complementary term ‘promptbook’ has sometimes been described as anachronistic, but Tiffany Stern has shown that the early modern theatre did have prompters, and they must have used a manuscript (Rehearsal). We nevertheless prefer to use the more neutral term ‘playbook’, which is equivalent to the documents Werstine calls ‘playhouse manuscripts’.4 The more restricted term ‘official playbook’ refers specifically to the document that held the licence to perform from the office of the Master of the Revels.5 These manuscripts no longer survive for the plays most widely associated with Shakespeare’s authorship. But at some time around 1603–4, Shakespeare worked alongside Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, Henry Chettle, and a theatre scribe and annotator now designated as Hand C (because his name was not recorded); their task was to revise a play named on its protective vellum wrapper as ‘The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore’ (see Figure 1a; for a transcript of the play, see 4 The term ‘playbook’ is based on the theatre companies’ use of the commonplace word ‘book’ to refer restrictively to a playhouse manuscript. 5 On the function of the Master of the Revels in controlling dramatic performance, see Dutton.\n\nxxvi\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 26\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nTHE PLAY IN THE THEATRE\n\n1b Sir Thomas More, fol. 9a.

The original text was a transcript of the entire play in the hand of Anthony Munday. The theatre company had previously submitted this manuscript to the Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney, hoping that he would inscribe in it his permission for the play to be performed. Tilney instead wrote a stern message prohibiting the play from the stage until such time as all scenes depicting an insurrection by London citizens had been removed; he also marked most of these passages for deletion, along with others including part of the scene in which More refuses to put his name to various articles as the King required. Perhaps because time had passed, or because the end of the Tudor dynasty (with the death of Elizabeth I) had made the material less problematic, the theatre company decided that the play could be salvaged without deleting the insurrection entirely, but with revisions. These included Shakespeare’s rewriting of the scene in which More persuades the rebels to lay down their arms and surrender to the authority of the King (see Figure 1b) and one or perhaps two drafts of short soliloquies that come to us as transcripts copied out by the theatre scribe known as Hand C (see Figure 1d).\n\nxxvii\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 27\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition\n\n1c Sir Thomas More, fol. 11b. The original text in Anthony Munday’s hand has been vigorously deleted so that the page can hold the paste-in (see Figure 1d). Modern conservators have detached the paste-in, but its position is indicated by the paler shade of the paper in the lower part of the page.\n\nSir Thomas More is important partly on account of its unusually complex and explicit documentation of the processes of textual generation in the theatre, and partly in its preservation of dramatic dialogue in Shakespeare’s hand. In both respects it is illuminating and yet misleading. The various stages through which a play manuscript might progress are all represented: authorship; authorial transcription; scribal transcription; annotation of stage directions, speech prefixes, and even dialogue; revision by a dramatist working on the existing pages of the manuscript; and revision by a dramatist by cancelling the original pages and providing new ones. To this extent it provides an object lesson in the processes of textual alteration that become largely invisible once the play is set in print. However, few play manuscripts can have contained the work of so many dramatists, none of the other surviving manuscripts shows such a determined effort to reconstruct a play after it had been disallowed by the Master of the Revels in its existing state, and none of them has such an active and various annotator, transcriber, and co-ordinator as Sir Thomas More’s Hand C. Despite these caveats, every aspect of the development of the manuscript of Sir Thomas More as a document has parallels in other surviving play manuscripts, and the evolution of the script as a potential theatre work is typical of the processes of the\n\n1d Sir Thomas More, Addition III, originally pasted into fol. 11b.

Shakespeare’s own role in rewriting the play is directly comparable with the contribution we understand that he made to the expanded version of Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy, and also bears comparison with his likely expansion of 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI. The manuscript of Sir Thomas More shows us Shakespeare deeply embedded in all the textual processes of theatrical creativity. The system whereby professional drama was controlled and censored had evolved in part to protect theatre from its critics and to ensure that professional companies were available to provide the Court with play performances during periods of festivity. Its operation can be seen in Sir Thomas More. When the Original Text was submitted to Tilney, he made extensive deletion marks before writing in the left margin of the first page, ‘Leaue out ye insurrection wholy & ye Cause ther off & begin wt Sir Tho: Moore att ye mayors sessions wt a reportt afterwardes off his good service don beinge Shriue off Londō vppō a mutiny Agaynst ye Lūmbardes only by A shortt reportt & nott otherwise att your own perrilles E Tyllney.’ This is a licence conditional on significant changes, and\n\n2 Thomas Middleton, The Lady’s Tragedy, fol. 55b.

Of the surviving manuscripts, only a minority contain the licence of the Master of the Revels or his appointee. It is possible that an adjunct leaf containing the licence has been lost in some cases, but this explanation is hypothetical, and the absence of a licence from so many theatre manuscripts raises an important question as to their status and function: a document can be what Paul Werstine calls a ‘playhouse manuscript’, in the defining sense that it has annotations made in the theatre with performance in mind, without it being the official document that sanctions performance. Alterations and additions in such manuscripts mainly address stage directions and speech prefixes, with a view to changing or clarifying the requirements of staging (see Figure 2). Some manuscripts contain deletions, either by theatre personnel or by the Master of the Revels. There might also be revisions, as is the case with Shakespeare’s revision of Sir Thomas More or the passages added on separate slips of paper when Middleton’s The Lady’s Tragedy was being prepared for performance.6 A theatre manuscript of a popular play could remain in use for many years, and so build up successive strata of annotation (Long). The playbook was not, however, the only document used in the theatre, nor was it a complete record of the text. A play might well begin documentary life as a ‘plot’, an outline of the scenes and the roles performing in it. This would form the basis of the agreement between the dramatist and the theatre company to write the play, and in the case of a collaboratively written play it would provide a scheme whereby each dramatist would know what was required of him and a guide as to the relation between one scene and another. This might usefully be designated the author’s plot. There are some surviving examples of a similar kind of document mounted on card and with a rectangular hole cut in the middle vertically and about two-thirds of the way up. These evidently had functional use in the theatre—the holes are understood to allow the sheet to be hung on a peg—and are designated backstage plots (see Figure 3). They included the names of actors, and specified the key elements of the stage action. These documents evidently derived from the playbook, as too did the actors’ parts, which took the form of inscribed scrolls of paper (Palfrey and Stern). The surviving part of Orlando in Robert Greene’s Orlando Furioso preserves the lines that would have been learnt and delivered by the actor Edward Alleyn (see Figure 4; for a transcript, see Greg, Abridgements). Each speech was headed with a very short cue line from the end of the previous speech of another actor, typically no more than two or three words. The relation between these various documents can be represented diagrammatically: author’s plot\n\n|\n\nauthor’s draft\n\n|\n\nplaybook backstage plot actors’ parts Thus the backstage plot and actors’ parts would complement each other. Other documents complemented the playbook itself; these would contain prologues, epilogues, and scores for songs and other music (Stern, Documents). An example of a prologue as a separate document can be seen in the 1623 Folio text of Troilus and Cressida, which was originally printed without the prologue; the first page was then reset so that the prologue could be printed on the recto page of the leaf that held the opening of the play proper on its verso (see the play’s Textual Introduction). Music is a more widely prevalent phenomenon. Whereas effects such as flourishes, alarums, and drum-beats for marching were formulaic and would need no inscription, new songs required a formal setting; so 6 Parallel texts of the pre-revision and post-revision play are presented in Briggs’s edition in Middleton, Collected Works. See also Rasmussen.\n\nxxx\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 30\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nSHAKESPEARE IN PRINT\n\n3 Part of the backstage plot of The Seven Deadly Sins, Part 2. Dulwich MS XIX.

The separate existence of these scores has the consequence that there are sometimes lacunae in texts derived from the playhouse because the words resided only on the manuscript holding the music. There is a further consequence in that the musical setting could become the source of various transcriptions and alterations. For example, the song ‘Come Away’, probably written by Robert Johnson for Middleton’s adaptation of Macbeth, was copied into the book of lute songs owned in the 1620s by Ann Twice of Gloucester, where it appeared in an altered form for performance by a single voice, alongside other songs by Johnson and other leading composers of the early seventeenth century (see Figure 5). Through circulation in manuscript, the music and words could be repeatedly altered, as is typified in the various seventeenthcentury settings of songs such as Measure for Measure’s ‘Take, O Take Those Lips Away’ or The Tempest’s ‘Where the Bee Sucks’. These issues are examined in detail in Cunningham’s general essay on music and his musical introductions to individual plays.\n\nSHAK ESPEAR E IN PR INT One further document associated with the theatre is the playbill, which announced the performance of the play. These were posted outside the theatre and in other public places. Unlike the documents already considered, they were produced on the printing press, and therefore in multiple copies perhaps running to hundreds. In this respect, as Tiffany Stern notes, ‘every play was a little bit printed’ (‘Playbills’). A monopoly to produce playbills was held by James Roberts from 1594 until his retirement in 1606, and thereafter by Roberts’s successor William Jaggard. Both stationers were involved in the printing of Shakespeare editions; William Jaggard and his son Isaac were to be the printers and co-publishers of the 1623 First Folio. It is possible that a copy of a playbill would sometimes be attached to a manuscript when it was sold to a publisher, to become the source of the play title as published, and of any further information about it that was presented on the printed title page (‘Playbills’, 82–7). Like the theatre, the book industry was commercial. It too had to advertise\n\nxxxi\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 31\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition its wares, and the title-page played a crucial role in this. Plays from the public theatre were not automatically, or even usually, bestsellers, and the publisher’s acumen in deciding on the presentation, format, and number of copies of the book was crucial to its potential to make a modest profit.7 In the early years of Shakespeare play publication Shakespeare was invisible as author. As can be seen in the title-pages reproduced at the head of our Textual Introductions, in the space where other publications would identify the author we find instead the name of the theatre company. This was usual for plays from the professional theatre. The company owned the play manuscript, and in the early modern theatre the rights of the dramatist were undefined. It is often argued that collaborative writing was the norm, and that the dramatist had little intellectual or social status. This, however, gives a distorted picture of Shakespeare’s early collaborators Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, George Peele, and perhaps Thomas Watson and Thomas Kyd. They were educated and selfassertive writers whose plays were often written by single authorship. In contrast, in his early years as a dramatist Shakespeare learnt his craft by collaborating probably more promiscuously than any known dramatist with whom he worked. His encroachment as a stage actor onto the territory of the professional dramatist, and his spectacular success in doing so, were clearly resented, at least by some. The pamphlet Greenes Groats-worth of Witte (1592) lambasted him as ‘an vp-start Crow, beautifed with our feathers, that with his Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and beeing an absolute Iohannes fac totum, is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey’ (sig. F1v). The pamphlet identifies Shakespeare as ‘Shake-scene’, and turns his verse against him by reworking the line in 3 Henry VI 4.137, ‘Oh 4 Part of the actor’s part of Orlando. From Robert Tygers Heart, wrapt in a Womans Hide’. Though Greene’s Orlando Furioso (c. 1591). Dulwich MSS 1, Shakespeare wrote the play in collaboration, the article 138. Dulwich College, London. In the hand of a line was evidently so memorable that it could be playhouse scribe, with some annotation probably by recognized—and recognized as Shakespeare’s— the actor Edward Alleyn. even after it had been parodically altered. Contradictorily, Shakespeare is condemned for both beautifying himself with feathers stolen from other writers and penning famous lines that were known to be his well before the play in question was published in print. 7 The foundational study of the early modern printed book as material and cultural object is Febvre and Martin.

The Groatsworth is itself a journalistic product of its moment, a thing of print. Nevertheless, as the seller of the manuscript was commonly the theatre company, and as the cachet of the play quarto might well be its association with performance by that company, print offered no guarantees that the author would be identified. Shakespeare’s narrative poems and plays begin to appear in print in 1592–3, at shortly before the time when he largely abandoned collaboration and initiated a long period of sole authorship as regular dramatist of the Lord Chamberlain’s (later King’s) Men.8 But it was not until 1598 that his name began to appear on title-pages of plays. The chronology of Shakespeare’s appearance in print is presented in Table 1 (xlv–xlviii). Throughout the publication of Shakespeare’s plays up to 1623, print is an after-effect of putting Shakespeare’s plays on the stage. The plays were never published before original performance, nor at the same time. So for instance, in 1597 the first editions of Richard II, Richard III, and Romeo and Juliet appeared in print. These plays had been written and first performed two or more years previously. By way of contrast, for theatregoers in 1597 the most recent plays on stage would be Merchant of Venice and 1 Henry IV. Plays may or may not have been revived on stage at the time they were published, but at that time they were not new to the stage. From the perspective of a book buyer, Shakespeare in print was always out of date. Shakespeare’s texts were propagated in two asynchronous sequences of theatre performance and print. Most of Shakespeare’s book readers would undoubtedly have known his plays on stage, and so perceived the disjunction between the two media. Whereas Shakespeare’s mature plays were localized and to some extent branded by virtue of their performance at the theatres of the Lord Chamberlain’s/King’s Men, the company of which he was a leading member, his plays in print were issued by diverse publishers and would be sold in various bookshops. Shakespeare in print was a haphazard phenomenon before the First Folio. The frequency of reprinting is a clear measure of popularity, and on this basis Shakespeare’s narrative poems Venus and Adonis and Lucrece emerge as by far his most popular works. That popularity was sustained throughout the period under review. In the late 1590s Shakespeare’s name came to be associated with the sub-genre of the monarchical English history play. Some were Shakespeare’s most popular plays: quickly reprinted in the late 1590s, and still in demand in 8 The earliest publication is Arden of Faversham, published in 1592. The Lord Chamberlain’s Men was founded, with Shakespeare as sharer, in 1594.\n\nxxxiii\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 33\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition the 1630s. In contrast, however, the history 2 Henry IV and other plays such as Much Ado, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello appeared in only one known edition before 1623. These editions must have made little money for their publishers, as the costs of producing a first edition were significantly higher than those for a reprint. The early publication history is enriched by evidence from the Stationers’ Register, which records the entry of titles to publishers and transfers of ownership. The legislation governing the book trade demanded that all books were licensed for publication. Control was most immediately exercised by the Stationers’ Company, the trade guild of master printers, publishers, and booksellers. Grant of a licence depended on the Company wardens being persuaded that the title had not previously been granted to another stationer, and that the prospective book contained no offensive matter that should be prohibited (Clegg, Elizabethan; Clegg, Jacobean). The licence was written into the publisher’s manuscript of the work, but for greater security and at the expense of an additional fee the title could be entered in the Company Register (Blayney, ‘Publication’). Many titles were not so entered, and there is nothing intrinsically suspicious about the absence of an entry. But an entry exists for most of Shakespeare’s works. This documentation provides independent evidence of the form of the title in the publisher’s manuscript, and a precise date by which that manuscript was in the publisher’s hands. The censorship of books fell under the authority of the Church. When a stationer presented a manuscript to the Stationers’ Company to obtain permission to publish, the wardens of the Company would refer the book to a Church official if they considered its content to be questionable. So for example Richard III was entered in the Stationers’ Register ‘vnder thandes of mr Barlowe, and mr warden Man’. Thomas Man licensed the text for printing as a warden of the Stationers’ Company. William Barlow was the chaplain to John Whitgift, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the naming of Barlow shows that the wardens had decided that Richard III needed review by the Church authorities on account of its content. The main concerns that might lead to a book being referred in this way were religion and politics. The review of Richard III is unsurprising, as the play presents the overthrow and killing of an anointed king by the founder of the Tudor dynasty. The play was nevertheless allowed to be printed in full. Whereas Richard III was allowed by the Church, the Register does not record any ecclesiastical intervention over Richard II, which deals with the deposition, or forced abdication, of another anointed king. The crucial scene in which Richard resigns his authority is excluded from the early quarto editions, but perhaps on account of prior censorship for theatre performance. The text of Shakespeare does not appear to have been greatly affected by direct print censorship, which is perhaps not surprising in the case of plays that had already been allowed for performance on stage. Printing would usually commence only once the entitlement to publish had been secured. If printing proceeded without delay, the book might appear in the bookseller’s shop a few weeks after the entry. Some publications were delayed. Troilus and Cressida was entered on 7 February 1603 without an edition appearing (at least any that we know of), and then re-entered six years later to a different publisher on 28 January 1609, and finally issued in that year. Antony and Cleopatra was entered on 20 May 1608 to Edward Blount, but as far as is known it was not published until the 1623 Folio, a volume to which Blount contributed as copy-holder. Love’s Labour’s Lost and Romeo and Juliet are the most clear-cut examples of Shakespeare plays that were not initially entered in the Register. They can be taken to illustrate several aspects of the publisher’s entitlement to print. In neither case does the absence of an entry offer evidence for surreptitious publication. Romeo and Juliet was originally published in a shorter version by John Danter in 1597, and in a longer version by Cuthbert Burby in 1599. An entry to either publisher may have been pre-empted by the 1562–3 entry of Arthur Brooke’s verse translation The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Iuliet (STC 1356.3), as the entitlement to one work extended to other works that went by the same name or a similar one. No such explanation relates to Love’s Labour’s Lost, though it is likewise understood to have been published in an earlier (now lost) edition than the earliest surviving quarto, which too was issued by Burby (Freeman and Grinke). The key point is that, despite the lack of an entry in the Register for either play, both Romeo and Juliet and Love’s Labour’s Lost came into the accepted ownership of Burby.9 Romeo and Juliet had originally been published in a shorter version by John Danter in 1597, 9 In contrast, Burby entered Edward III in the regular way before printing it.\n\nxxxiv\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 34\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nTHE TEXT IN THE PRESS but it was Burby, the publisher of the second edition of 1599, who transferred the title to Nicholas Ling through an entry in the Register in 1607. Burby was publishing his Shakespeare play quartos at the point when Shakespeare was emerging as a named playwright, his plays had started to appear regularly in print, and the reprinting of them was becoming common. In the years 1597–1600 at least, Shakespeare’s theatre company the Lord Chamberlain’s Men may have adopted a policy of releasing manuscripts of plays for publication, perhaps to stimulate fresh interest in them after their initial appeal was beginning to fade. Thus by 1598–9, from a book-reader’s point of view Shakespeare had become a recognized playwright, and, from a stationer’s point of view, publishing a Shakespeare play was established as a financially sound undertaking. The marketability of play quartos was probably both enhanced by and reflected in the bold claim that the current drama of the London stage matched that of ancient Greek and Rome, in Meres’s Palladis Tamia, in which Meres specifically praised a number of Shakespeare’s plays. The publisher was none other than Burby. Lukas Erne has demonstrated that in print Shakespeare was by some way the most popular dramatist of his time, with more titles and more overall editions than any other dramatist, and a higher rate of reprint than any other except Francis Beaumont, who is represented by far fewer titles (Erne, Book Trade). Within this overall picture, the detail is more complex, suggesting neither a constant level of popularity nor a uniform rise. On the contrary: the frequency of publication of new Shakespeare editions slumped after 1600, and there are disputes as to the sources of three of the five new quartos published after that year. As for the remaining two, Troilus and Cressida must necessarily have already been in the hands of the stationer James Roberts when he entered it in the Stationers’ Register in 1603; and the scribe who prepared the theatre playbook of King Lear may have retained the draft he had copied, later to sell it to the publishers. Despite the uncertainties, the change that takes place after 1600 is clear. It may be added that in that year four plays belonging to Shakespeare’s company, his As You Like It, Henry V, and Much Ado, along with Ben Jonson’s Every Man In His Humour, were ‘staied’ in the Stationers’ Register. The significance of this note, an annotation on a fly-leaf rather than a regular entry, has been widely debated (Knowles, 353–64; Hirrel). By one interpretation, perhaps the most likely, the theatre company was seeking to control publication. Three of the four plays (all except As You Like It) were published shortly afterwards; nevertheless, if the entry expresses a turning point in the theatre company’s attitude to play publication, this would be consistent with the non-appearance of new editions that was to follow. But the most notable trend in the publication history of Shakespeare plays during his lifetime—the decline in new editions from 1600—defies clear explanation. It might have been driven by supply or by demand. It remains unclear whether Shakespeare himself played any active role in shaping his own existence as a dramatist in print.\n\nTHE TEXT IN THE PR ESS The publisher holding a licensed manuscript could print it himself (if he had the skill and equipment) or else commission a printer to set and print the copies of the book, which would be returned to the publisher with the sheets folded and stitched together. Binding was commissioned by the bookseller, but copies were often sold unbound, and small-format books often remained so (Gaskell, 143–53). The printer’s charges would be based on the number of sheets in each copy of the book, the number of edition copies, and the quality of paper (Blayney, ‘Publication’). The print run might be set at around seven or eight hundred for a typical quarto, and was subject to a rule of the Stationers’ Company stipulating a maximum of 1500. The calculation of costs depended on decisions about design, ornamentation, and type-size. Once these were established, the manuscript was annotated with instructions to the reader and ‘cast off’: marked up to indicate where the page-breaks would fall (see Figures 6a and 6b).10 Casting off was particularly tricky in a manuscript of a play because 10 Casting off in the first instance enabled calculation of the necessary amount of paper (Gaskell, 41), but would need to be especially accurate if, as was common, the compositors were to set the text by forme (see below).\n\nxxxv\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 35\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition\n\n6a The manuscript of Thomas Browne, A Key to the King’s Cabinet.

As can be seen from the examples of play manuscripts reproduced above, verse dialogue occupied the middle half of the page, prose extended rightwards, and speech prefixes and many stage directions were written in columns of space to the left and right of the dialogue. But a printed play was usually set in a single column. Marginal stage directions often needed to be set on type lines of their own (and the placement of such directions, being subject to interpretation, was sometimes incorrectly determined). The repositioning of speech prefixes and stage directions added to the complex judgements to be made in casting off. Miscalculation of where the page-breaks would fall certainly happened, and if a printer was typesetting a page for which the following page in the book had already been printed there was no possibility of redistributing the lines between those two pages to correct the error. In such a case the boundary was immovable and the necessity of finishing a page at the predetermined line in the script led to space shortage or space wastage at the foot of the page. These difficulties could in turn affect the spellings of words, the division of verse lines, and even, occasionally, the wording of the text itself.\n\nxxxvi\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 36\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nTHE TEXT IN THE PRESS\n\n6b The printed text of the same passage, in Thomas Browne, A Key to the King’s Cabinet (Oxford: Leonard Lichfield, 1645), sig. B4v–C1r.\n\nThe printer’s sequence of work would depend on the number of compositors available to him, the number of presses in his shop, and the volume of other work in which he was currently engaged.11 He would need to decide between one of two commonly-used procedures for setting type. Pages could be composed either ‘seriatim’, that is, in the order that they would be read, or ‘by forme’, which entails setting all the pages of one side of the sheet (a forme), before setting the pages for the other side.12 By this latter method, in the common quarto format consisting of a sheet of eight pages, the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth pages of that sheet would all be set before (or, more rarely, after) the second, third, sixth, and seventh pages (see Figure 7). Setting by forme would make critical use of casting-off marks. This would have the possible advantage that the compositor(s) would supply a completed forme of type for the press at regular intervals, occurring after every fourth and eighth page of the book, rather than irregularly after every seventh and eighth page as with seriatim setting. The risk of setting by forme was that, if casting off was inaccurate, the compositor would be faced with the need to save or lose space to keep to the 7 The layout and folding of pages in quarto format. predetermined page-breaks.

From Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing (1683–4), Plate 1.\n\nthe page-breaks were not rigorously determined by previously set pages, as the order of setting followed the order of the lines in the copy. Work in the printer’s shop was divided between setting the type, printing the sheets of paper by pressing it onto the inked type, and folding and gathering the printed sheets to make up completed books. The setting of type was a complex process in its own right. Types were taken from a set of wooden cases with boxed compartments for each letter, ligature, punctuation mark, and space in the required type face (roman, italic, or black letter) and size (see Figure 8). Each type would be placed in the compositor’s ‘stick’, a shallow tray whose width established the determined measure of print on the page (see Figure 9). Types were set upside-down with their faces outward. The vertical turnabout enabled the second line of type to rest on top of the first, and so on. Depending on the size, about four lines of type could be composed and stacked up in the compositor’s stick before they were carefully transferred to a larger flat tray called a galley. By repeating this process, the compositor gradually built up a page of type. When all the pages making up a forme had been set, it was provided with the running titles (i.e. the book title as printed at the top of the page), catchwords, signatures (referencing some of the recto pages by the sheet letter and the leaf number), and any ornaments or rules that might be required. The pages were placed within a wooden or iron frame and surrounded by pieces of wood known as ‘furniture’. The type was then locked into a solid block by hammering wooden wedges or ‘quoins’ between the furniture and the outer frame. This process of laying out and consolidating the forme is known as ‘imposition’. Once the forme was tight and the surface level, it could be transferred to the press-stone of the hand-press for printing (see Figure 10). The sheet of paper was held in a two-part wooden framework known as the tympan and frisket. This hinged onto the end of the coffin, the shallow horizontal box that held the pressstone. To initiate the printing, the coffin was pulled clear of the press mechanism, the tym9 ‘The manner of holding the Composing Stick’.

The frisket, a second frame, hinged onto the end of the tympan. It too was covered with parchment (or paper), but, unlike the tympan parchment, this would be cut with rectangular holes corresponding to the pages of type. Through these holes the type came into contact with the paper. Once the paper was pinned onto the tympan, the pressman lowered the frisket onto the tympan and paper to secure the paper round the edge. Then the whole unit was folded over the forme of type assembled on the press-stone, with the windowed parchment of the frisket lying between the type and the paper. The pressman slid the coffin, press-stone, tympan, and frisket as a unit on rails (known as ‘ribs’) under the press mechanism. He then pulled a bar, which lowered the platen: a flat, horizontal piece of wood. This pressed the paper evenly onto the raised inked surface of the type. Compositors, and their role in the process of manufacture, can be investigated by means of detailed attention to mechanical features 10 Woodcut illustration of a printer’s workshop. such as the measure, the recurrence of head- From Hartmann Schopper, De omnibus illiberalibus siue lines, the recurrence of type on successive mechanicis artibus, with woodcut illustrations by Jost pages, and variables of text-setting such as Amman (Frankfurt, 1574).

The success of bibliographers in identifying compositors varies considerably from text to text, and depends on the length of the text, the format (a folio page holds more text and therefore supplies more potential evidence than a quarto page), and the distinctiveness or otherwise of the different compositors’ work. There is currently less scholarly confidence in the findings of compositor studies than there was at the time of the Oxford Shakespeare of 1986–7, especially in relation to minor compositors of the First Folio. The virtue of the printing press lay in its ability to produce near-identical objects on an industrial scale. If the type remained in a locked and stable block throughout the printing, the printed text it produced would be invariant. In practice, however, different copies of the same edition often contained variant readings. These arose through the second of two routine kinds of correction. The first, a term familiar today, is proof-correction, whereby a sample copy of the forme was printed before the main print run so that it could be checked for imperfection and error. A few proof-sheets of the period survive,13 including examples from the Shakespeare First Folio (see Figure 11). The example illustrated reflects changes made during the print run, but, in contrast, the rejected reading in an initial proof-sheet would not normally appear in any copy of the finished book, as the proof-sheet, marked up by hand with instructions for correction, was not fit to be used for any other purpose. In contrast, press-corrections made during the print run resulted in differences between 13 For reproductions, see Moore, Plates 50–57, and Hinman’s Folio facsimile, Appendix A, Plates VI and VII.\n\nxxxix\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 39\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition\n\n11 The original setting of Shakespeare, Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies (1623), sig. xx6v. A page of Antony and Cleopatra, marked for stop-press correction by the proof-reader. The uncorrected state is found in several copies of the Folio as well as the marked sheet. Corrections include ‘their’ (an obsolescent spelling) to ‘there’, ‘art’ (a typographical error perhaps influenced by the previous word ‘What’) to ‘are’, ‘seure’ (transposed letters) to ‘serue’, ‘of full tide’ (transposed words) to ‘full of tide’, as well as irregularities of punctuation, spacing, and inking.

The changes introduced in press-correction might be ‘mechanical’—in which case they corrected imperfections of printing resulting from loose or uneven type and the like—or ‘textual’—in which case they altered actual or perceived errors of spelling, punctuation, or wording. Textual corrections were themselves of two different kinds. The forme might have been checked against the manuscript, or alternatively corrections might be made purely on the initiative of the corrector.14 Consultation of the copy gives a ‘corrected’ reading greater authority than an ‘uncorrected’ one, while dependence on the initiative of the corrector gave the ‘uncorrected’ reading greater authority than a ‘corrected’ one. A facsimile of a page can give us only an image of a single state of the text. 14 For further detail, see Jowett, ‘Kingdom of Error’, in this volume.\n\nxl\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 40\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nCOPY TEXTS The present edition instead shows, on the page, both the corrected and uncorrected readings. The editor still has to make a choice about which of the two readings is an error, or whether both of them might be different errors for something else.\n\nCOPY TEXTS Recent decades have witnessed a collapse of confidence in the earlier categorization of Shakespeare texts. Difficulties relating to the terms ‘foul papers’ and ‘promptbook’ have been mentioned already. Editors are also now reluctant to identify the wide separation observed by the New Bibliography between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ quartos. This is not to say that the nature of the manuscript underlying a print edition is completely beyond scrutiny, but rather that our understanding of such matters is provisional, and the proposed dichotomies raise as many questions as they answer. For the most part, the Complete Works pursues the relationship between different antecedent manuscripts only to the extent that it is immediately relevant to the editing of the text. These issues are considered more fully in Alternative Versions. As regards the choice of copy text, the New Oxford Shakespeare foregrounds a criterion that, though related to the qualities of the underlying manuscripts, is directly observable and even measurable in the printed texts themselves. It is the criterion of length. One reason for this emphasis lies in the aim of the edition to be Complete. A criticism of the 1986–7 edition was that the choice of copy text led to the omission of significant passages such as Hamlet’s soliloquy ‘How all occasions do inform against me’. The copy text was the 1623 Folio. But the quarto of 1604–5 is significantly longer, precisely because it includes such passages. The criterion of length shifts the editorial emphasis away from the textual minutiae that reflect proximity or distance from Shakespeare’s hand and onto the literally larger issues of structure and content. But in the case of Hamlet there is no conflict, because the 1604–5 quarto, the longest early edition, has always been considered to reflect Shakespeare’s hand closely. Indeed, one reason for paying serious attention to the question of word-count is that in the normal course of things an authorial text, as it is transmitted away from the immediate engagement of the author, will tend to shrink rather than grow. The text might be subject to censorship, theatrical cutting, accidental omission, or loss of leaves, all of which will make it shorter. Humphrey Moseley, in his prefatory epistle to the reader of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio, noted that ‘When these Comedies and Tragedies were presented on the Stage, the Actours omitted some Scenes and Passages (with the Author’s consent) as occasion led them’. He might be implying that the 1647 volume had better credentials than the 1623 Shakespeare Folio, which, though supposedly printed from Shakespeare’s ‘True Originall Copies’, contained texts reflecting various cuts of this kind; for Moseley goes on to claim that ‘now you have both All that was Acted, and all that was not; even the perfect full Originalls without the least mutilation’. The present edition has comparable aims. Only revision, by the original author or a new one, can make the text longer. Even that is not guaranteed to do so: a play with new additions might also have new subtractions. The later Folio text of a play such as King Lear is shorter than its quarto antecedent. Macbeth, thought to be revised by Thomas Middleton, is by far the shortest of Shakespeare’s tragedies, no doubt partly for the same reason. Thus, following the erosion of the categorical opposition between ‘foul papers’ and ‘promptbooks’, there is often no longer a basis for choosing (as editors used to) between a ‘good’ quarto supposed to represent ‘foul papers’ and a Folio text supposed to represent a ‘promptbook’. Moreover, the Folio texts in question usually represent the playbook indirectly, either through transcription or through the transfer of manuscript readings to a printed quarto text. The playbook itself would often have developed over many years. It may well sometimes be the quarto text that is closest to the first staging. For example: the 1604–5 quarto of Hamlet, the copy text for this edition, shows signs of theatrical annotation; quarto Richard II has undergone censorship that is most likely to have been imposed for theatre performance; an actor’s name, now thought to be a feature of theatre manuscripts, appears in the 1599 ‘good’ quarto text of Romeo and Juliet; and quarto 1 Henry IV was almost certainly set from a transcript rather than an authorial manuscript. Though it cannot be demonstrated that all erstwhile ‘good’ quarto texts were actually printed from manuscripts\n\nxli\n\n000 NOS OS - Volume I.indb 41\n\n09/03/2017 11:39\n\nshakespeare, early modern textual cultures, and this edition annotated for the theatre, it is clear that some of them at least conform to Werstine’s description of playhouse manuscripts. Nevertheless, they are typically less altered from the author’s draft than the later playbooks that influence the Folio texts. Length is usually a symptom of proximity to the early state of the play.15 Once a copy text has been selected, to what extent should it be followed? Until the mid-twentieth century eclectic editing drawing on and sometimes combining both quarto and Folio texts was usual although unsystematic. W. W. Greg’s essay ‘The Rationale of Copy-Text’ influentially empowered eclectic editing by putting it on a firm intellectual basis via his distinction between ‘substantive’ and ‘accidental’ readings. The accidentals were matters such as spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. Greg rightly argued that these reflected the preferences of printers and owed little to the underlying manuscript. Nevertheless, some printed editions were closer to the author’s handwriting than others, and an editor should prefer a copy text that had undergone as little interference as possible. The copy text had an overall function in establishing the forms that would be accepted in an old-spelling edition. In contrast, the substantive readings needed to be considered on a oneby-one basis, in recognition that a collateral text is likely to correct the errors found in the copy text. Greg’s distinction thus provided a rationale whereby editors were released from what he called the ‘tyranny of the copy text’ and could import individual readings from another edition where these were considered more likely to be correct. The ‘accidental’/‘substantive’ distinction is, however, highly artificial (Jowett, ‘Full Pricks’). Moreover, eclectic editing was given a check in the 1980s, when textual theorists began to see the conflated text as an idealized construct that related insecurely at best to any historically existent or lost state of the text. Recent editorial theory has sought to purge the Shakespeare editorial tradition of its apparent addiction to hybrids of mixed quarto and Folio origin. No point in this development was more critical than the decision on the 1986–7 Oxford Shakespeare to present two versions of King Lear. Since then, few scholars have argued that the text of King Lear is a single entity.16 There has been wide acceptance both that Shakespeare revised the play and that the two texts differ also in ways that are not dependent on authorial revision. Since 1986 the questions about King Lear have usually been the subsidiary ones. Does the cultural authority of the traditional conflated text prevail over the claim on behalf of the separate versions printed in 1604 and 1623? To what degree are the differences between those two tex"
