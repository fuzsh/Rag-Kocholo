        "text": "RECORDED IN QUARANTINE\n\nA new music series and a return to publishing. Born in the Quarantine. We've all been around a lot longer than the last year but it seems like we are learning new ways to get by. Music has always been there for me but I've found that by challenging myself to learn about and share the new music being founded in the midst of this horrible mess... the art and the shared experience might just be what we need to find our light.\n\nThis woman is a gift. One of my favorite vocalists, and a thoughtful writer - Daphne Lee Martin is a living paintbrush (and the perfect subject to kick off this 2021 music series.) This song and a number of really amazing others floating around in Daphne's head have come to fruition over the last year. Some dozen-plus are going to be appearing on her upcoming album The Starter Wife (an LP) with lots of surprises (think multi-media and big). Also recorded in these small and socially segregated sessions are a series of remarkable promotional Cover Songs for which Masterpiece is the first. And what a start!\n\nMasterpiece was:\n\nDane Scozzari on drums\n\nAndrew Sovine on guitars\n\nDaphne - vocals, arrangements, everything else\n\nRecorded and Mixed at Pleasure Loves Company in New London, CT\n\nMastered by Jim Carpenter at Loco Dare Productions"
