        "text": "When Sean McKeon created “LAX in LA” as his project in Landmark Education’s Self-Expression and Leadership Program, as a way of empowering youth by bringing Lacrosse to inner city Los Angeles, he began with one school: His own. McKeon teaches at the Manual Arts High School, where he also took on being the Lacrosse coach. The program has now grown to where LAX in LA runs five Lacrosse teams in South Los Angeles, Watts, and Huntington Park, and they expect to have 14 teams by the end of the summer!\n\nIn addition to offering high schoolers a great sport, LAX in LA provides them a constructive way to spend their out-of-school time and establishes a framework of personal improvement that is applicable to all areas of life. The program is a radical and life changing experience in an area familiar with gang activity and violence. The program has a code of ethics as well as strict guidelines for participation designed to empower the players: 1) Be accountable for yourself, your teammates and family, and your community; 2) Maintain a 2.5 GPA, 3) Attend all practices, 4) Consistently attend school, and 5) never lie to teammates and coaches. Players also required to participate monthly in community service activities. The program also provides study halls for players.\n\nMore than 200 high schoolers have now participated in the program. As LAX in LA has grown, so have its fundraising needs. The program is funded entirely by donations and grants from generous individuals and organizations.\n\nTo meet this challenge, McKeon and LAX in LA are throwing a novel musical fundraiser coming up from 7:30-11pm on April 20th. Livin’ the Music, a non-profit concert producer that helps put on shows with for worthy causes is assisting LAX in LA in having the fundraiser at Cozy’s Blues Club in Sherman Oaks California. The acoustic show will feature well known performers such as Ben Moody (from Evanessence) with his new protegé Hana Pestle, Rikki Rockett from Poison (bring your leather pants), Dilana (from Rockstar: Supernova) and a few others. In addition to the music, there will be a silent auction taking place simultaneously.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to get involved: Silent Auction items are still needed, and can be donated by calling 323-273-7312 or emailing [email protected]. To get involved in other ways, go to the LAX in LA website or call them at 818-723-7326, or come out to Cozy’s Blues Club on April 20th. Tickets are $10 at the door."
