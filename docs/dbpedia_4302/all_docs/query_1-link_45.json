        "text": "Perhaps we, as moderns, have been writing ancient women out of history in our facile efforts to include them. We do this, in particular, by emphasizing the absence of women in history, focusing superficially on exceptional images of women, and simplifying women into types that reflect our own expectations and values, and this approach obscures the complexities of ancient Near Eastern womanhood. However, by affording the ancient record its own voice, the individuality and complexity of women’s lives and facets of womanhood emerges to replace, rather than reiterate, the conventional grand narrative on “women” and to remind us that the ancient Near East was not as much of a man’s world as we have made it out to be.\n\nIn this paper we present a bibliographical list of works published between 2002 and 2015 which have focused on women and gender in ancient Near Eastern studies. In addition to the list, we also provide an introduction in which we consider the relationship between women’s studies and gender studies and present a selection of the trends and theoretical positions which have emerged since the late 1980s either inside the framework of gender studies, or in closely related fields such as queer studies, postcolonial studies and feminist epistemologies – the predominant trends in the time span covered by this overview. We hope that this work will provide ancient Near Eastern scholars with a useful research tool."
