        "text": "â€” GRAMMY IN THE HOUSE:\n\nOn Dec. 16, a Grammy winner is set to perform at Juanita's Cantina Ballroom in Little Rock. Who's that?\n\nFormer Little Rock resident Ben Moody, who scored a couple of Grammys back in February 2004 (Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance) for his work with Evanescence.\n\nWhat's he been up to since? After abruptly leaving Evanscence while on tour back in October 2003, Moody spent some time in rehab, was diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder, and has worked with, as a songwriter or producer, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson and Celine Dion.\n\nAlso, Moody's song \"Everything Burns,\" featuring Anastacia, was featured in the Fantastic Four movie soundtrack.\n\nAlso included on the bill along with Moody at Juanita's that evening will be up-andcoming Hana Pestle.\n\nPestle is a 19-year-old singer and songwriter originally from Billings, Mont., and now of Los Angeles. She began working with Moody and Michael \"Fish\" Herring, who helped produce and write the songs for her first album, back in June 2006.\n\nMoody's parents, Ben and Melissa, reside in Little Rock.\n\nWAVE OF SPEAKERS:\n\nThose surfing the Internet can now check out a new Web site featuring the more than 125 speakers and the lectures they offer each year at the Clinton School of Public Service.\n\nThe programs are free and open to the public but require reservations.\n\nTo check out the Clinton School's new site, visit www.clintonschoolspeakers.com.\n\nCASE OF BAD TIMING?\n\nIn light of the beating and subsequent Oct. 25 death of KATV Channel 7 morning news anchor Anne Pressly last month in her Heights home by an unknown assailant, there were some raised eyebrows when the Little Rock station, an ABC affiliate, recently launched a special month-long promotion for its November sweeps period.\n\nThe \"Choose Your News\" promo with reporter Kristin Fisher encourages viewers to vote each night from three story suggestions for the subject they'd most like to see covered next. The next day, Fisher begins pursuing the winning idea and viewers are encouraged to follow her throughout the gathering of the story via streaming video and postings by Fisher via an online blog and brief status updates on Twitter.com.\n\n\"Someone is with her at all times,\" news director Randy Dixon assured Paper Trails soon after the feature was launched when asked whether KATV management had any concerns the feature might encourage stalkers.\n\nBut one question remains: What was the person who chose the accompanying music promoting the new feature thinking? The song?\n\nA 1980s tune by Rockwell - \"Somebody's Watching Me.\"\n\nTIMELY ERROR:\n\nThe Food Network's Road Tasted with the Neelys show airing tonight and featuring Petit Jean Meats' Morrilton facility airs at 9 p.m. An earlier mention of it here gave the incorrect time."
