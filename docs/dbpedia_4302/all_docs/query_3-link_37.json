        "text": "Kilgore\n\nO'Brien's professional career began in 1998 when a local Providence, Rhode Island–based band, Kilgore asked him to join their lineup as their new bassist. A few weeks after joining, the band embarked on the Ozzfest 98 summer festival tour, where the band shared the stage with such bands as Ozzy Osbourne, Tool, Incubus, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit, and Motörhead. Next came a North American tour supporting Slayer and Fear Factory, then a European tour in the winter, supporting Fear Factory. In January 1999, vocalist Jay Berndt quit the band, which eventually led to the end of Kilgore.\n\nMethods of Mayhem\n\nIn April 2000, O'Brien moved to Los Angeles, and just three weeks later was asked to audition for Tommy Lee's new band Methods of Mayhem. O'Brien was offered the job the same day as the audition, and the band left for Europe eight days later and spent the summer playing some of the biggest festivals across Europe. (Dynamo Open Air, Rock Am Ring, Rock Im Park, Glastonbury Festival). Next, the band spent the rest of the summer touring the U.S. on the Ozzfest 2000 festival, sharing the main-stage with bands Ozzy Osbourne, Pantera, Godsmack, Static-X, Incubus, P.O.D., Queens of the Stone Age, and Disturbed.\n\nDisturbed\n\nIn early 2001, the multi-platinum selling metal band Disturbed asked O'Brien to join them on tour after their bassist Steve \"Fuzz\" Kmak had broken his ankle in a fall from a fire escape outside the band's rehearsal complex. O'Brien spent two months playing bass for Disturbed on an extensive tour throughout Europe, opening for Marilyn Manson.\n\nStatic-X\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the multi-platinum selling band Static-X called upon O'Brien to fill-in on tour after their bassist Tony Campos had fractured his collar-bone in a motorcycle accident. After having only one rehearsal with the band, O'Brien toured with Static-X on the \"Extreme Steel Tour\" which also included the legendary pairing of the bands Pantera and Slayer. This would ultimately be Pantera's last tour ever.\n\nTommy Lee\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Tommy Lee recorded and released two solo albums. In 2002, Never a Dull Moment was released, on which O'Brien has a songwriting credit, and 2005's Tommyland: The Ride. From 2002 to 2005, during the promotion of both those records, O'Brien played bass on both world tours and performed on several TV shows, including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Celebrity Roast of Pamela Anderson, and a handful of European TV shows, including Top of the Pops.\n\nRecording career\n\nIn 2004, O'Brien chose to focus more on recording sessions in Los Angeles. Over the next few years, O'Brien quickly accumulated an impressive resume of artists that he has recorded with, such as Celine Dion, Chris Cornell, Brian McKnight, Mýa, Tommy Lee, Lindsay Lohan, and Kelly Clarkson, including her number-one single, \"Because of You\", on the grammy-award-winning album, Breakaway.\n\nWe Are the Fallen\n\nIn 2009 O'Brien became a member of the new band We Are the Fallen, along with former Evanescence members Ben Moody, Rocky Gray, and John LeCompt, featuring American Idol runner-up Carly Smithson on vocals. The band was launched on June 22, 2009, at a press conference in Hollywood, California, and soon signed a deal with Universal Republic Records. Their debut album was released on May 11, 2010, and the band toured extensively throughout that year, supporting the band HIM, as well as playing many summer festivals in Europe such as Download Festival and Rock Am Ring.\n\nLita Ford\n\nIn early 2012, O'Brien joined Lita Ford's touring band. The band toured extensively in 2012 as the opening act for Def Leppard and toured the world in 2013 in support Living Like a Runaway. O'Brien played bass on Lita Ford's 2013 live album The Bitch Is Back...Live.\n\nDaughtry"
