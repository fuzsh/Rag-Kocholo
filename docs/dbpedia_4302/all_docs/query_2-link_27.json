        "text": "The Ignota membership journey has reached its final destination. The Gate, The Garden and The Mountain are now closed. The end is the beginning.\n\n♾\n\nThis will be our last Full Moon Journal at Ignota. After twenty-two moon journals over almost two years, we are now at the conclusion of the membership cycle. Thank you for joining us on this journey and for making Ignota’s work possible.\n\nGray Crawford: Astrology for the Full Moon in Leo\n\nThe astrological month ahead, stretching from the full moon in Leo on 25 January until the full moon in Virgo on 24 February, contains configurations that reflect the most significant astrological themes of the year. This period will not be a calm period, but one that highlights ongoing changes, allowing you to construct daily structures and routines to build upon for the rest of the year. The chaos and change erupting in current events have been upsetting and fear-provoking, also serving as harbingers of much vaster changes that will occur during the era-defining astrology of 2025 and 2026. Thus the month ahead is an opportune time to return to centre, grounding your focus in the work and relationships that matter the most to you.\n\nThis full moon in Leo illuminates the recent entrance of Pluto into Aquarius and activates the potency brewing between Jupiter and Uranus in Taurus, two of the major astrological signatures of the year. Uranus will possess an intensified presence due to stationing direct a couple of days after this lunation, while the moon separates from an opposition with Pluto and applies toward a catalysing square with Jupiter. The building synergy between Jupiter and Uranus will ultimately culminate toward the end of April, but in the month ahead we will notice waves and currents of its liberatory force to direct. Combined with the entrance of Pluto into Aquarius, we will feel the excitement of crossing a threshold into unknown potential, simultaneously holding the tension of the multiple crises unfolding across the globe. The time will be ripe for leaning into your most exciting vision by taking deliberate action free from fear.\n\nMost importantly, after Uranus stations direct on 27 January, all planets will be moving direct until Mercury eventually stations retrograde on 1 April. As a result, the month of February will be a key period for making substantial progress on the goals you have for the years ahead. Pay particular attention to the entrance of Mercury into Aquarius on 5 February, on which day the star of Hermes will also form a conjunction with Pluto. Mercury enjoys the intellectual resources of Aquarius, which it uses to analyse how to most effectively work toward communal goals and collective ideals. Pluto will spend most of 2024 in Aquarius, returning to Capricorn for its final pass from September through November. This means that the beginning of February will be an important time to gain clarity, as we’ll be given a preview of issues and personal meaning that Pluto’s ultimate entrance into Aquarius will deliver.\n\nThe new moon in Aquarius on 9 February will contain an electric atmosphere, one less restful than the typical new moon. Leave space in your schedule for the lightning strikes of Uranus, which can turn the tide of events in unexpected directions, as the Aquarius moon will be forming a stimulating square with this planet that will accelerate the speed of whatever changes may happen. In the following two weeks, as the Moon continues to increase in light, there will be a sequence of pivotal alignments corresponding with momentous developments in storylines. First, Mars will enter Aquarius on 13 February and form a conjunction with Pluto, followed by Venus entering Aquarius and forming a conjunction with Pluto on 16 February. Mars and Venus activating Pluto within days of one another will be another opportunity to become aware of new desires emerging from the depths unleashed by Pluto in Aquarius.\n\nWith the waxing moon, two of the major astrological unions of the year will occur as Chiron forms a conjunction with the north node of the moon in Aries on 19 February, followed by Venus conjoining Mars in Aquarius on 22 February. Chiron wants to mentor and guide us to a new level of development, but in order to endure his initiation we will have to tend to any internal fears restricting growth. By getting to the roots of our inhibitions, we may realise old stories we have been repeating about ourselves are not aligned with our true selves. The more we connect with the potency of our inner vitality and passion, the more we will be able to embody and express the new desires that can emerge with the new cycle beginning between Venus and Mars. Venus and Mars are all about the values and desires underlying our will to take action in the world. Their conjunction can clarify what we want in our relationships and work so that we can make necessary adjustments.\n\nThe full moon in Virgo on 24 February takes place opposite Saturn, with Mercury in Pisces also applying toward a conjunction with the sun and Saturn. The critical eye of the Virgo lunation will magnify the discrepancies between what we want and our present reality. If you feel modifications need to be made in a relationship in order to fulfil more of your own needs, take time to discern the most effective communication strategy rather than making disparaging critiques that will hinder the change you wish to have happen. While the full moon has some harsh aspects that could accentuate melancholy, there are harmonious aspects with Jupiter in Taurus that can foster belief that things can improve, that something can be done, and that all is not lost.\n\nNotes from the Ignota Diary\n\nIn Nature\n\nEarly this month, look out for the young shoots of nettles, chickweed and cleavers; these early spring weeds are common in temperate zones, with a plethora of uses as anti-inflammatories, diuretics, for lymphatic support and as sources of minerals and vitamins. Prepare in teas, salads and pestos.\n\nThroughout February look just below the surface of still waters to spot ghostly, jelly-like clouds of frogspawn – an early sign of spring. Frogs have many attendant superstitions, often attached to the weather; their croaking is believed to herald storms. Some cultures believe that the death of a frog brings floods and heavy rains, while others say that it will bring drought. Likewise, a frog coming into your home may bring good fortune, bad luck, a spell or a curse.\n\nFestivals, observances and celebrations\n\n25 January 2024 is Tu B’Shevat, ‘New Year for Trees’. Plant trees in memory of loved ones and eat grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates. This Jewish holiday is focused on responsible stewardship of the Earth, with some contemporary versions of the Tu B’Shevat seder emphasising environmentalist concerns. ‘Man is a tree of the field.’\n\nAlso Thaipusam, a festival celebrated by the Tamil community in the month of Thai, when the moon passes through the star Pusam and is at its brightest. After two days of ascetic preparations, today is the day of the ‘burden dance’, commemorating the day on which Parvati gave the warring god Murugan a javelin to vanquish the demon Soorapadman.\n\nOn the same day, Mahāyāna New Year, a Buddhist celebration falling on the first sighting of the full moon in January. Celebrate by honouring and praying to the gods, particularly Buddha, bathing his statues as a show of respect. Light candles as offerings to ensure happiness for the coming year.\n\n30 January is Sadeh (Iran), an ancient Zoroastrian festival dating back to the Achaemenid empire, also known as Adur-Jashan (Feast of Fire). Pray and dance around the bonfire, banishing cold and darkness. Let the fire burn all night, and in the morning take a small portion to the hearth of your home.\n\n1–2 February is Imbolc – also called Imbolg, Candlemas, Saint Brigid’s day. Marking the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, Imbolc celebrates renewal and the burgeoning of new life: the invisible presence of spring’s earliest signs. This is a time for cleansing, blessings, initiations and renewal of oaths. Out with the old and in with the new.\n\nIn Mongolia, 9 February 2024 is Bituun, the day before the feasting of Tsagaan Sar, the Mongolian new year. Today, during the dark moon period, clean homes and barns thoroughly. Light candles and leave three pieces of ice at the doorway for Palden Lhamo’s horse to drink; she is visiting every house tonight. Settle issues and pay debts, then meet your family and await the new year.\n\nThe following day, 10 February, is also the Lunar New Year, celebrated in China, the Republic of Korea, Tibet and Vietnam. The year of the Wood Dragon is the fifth in the twelve-year rotation cycle of the Chinese zodiac.\n\n13 February is Mardi Gras. Carnival celebration beginning after the Epiphany and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which opens the fasting of Lent.\n\nThe following day is Ash Wednesday, a day of prayer, fasting and repentance. Ash is placed on the forehead: ‘Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.’ In Haiti, the start of Rara Carnival’s street processions, dances and songs, vaccines, trumpets, bells, maracas, drums, güiras, güiros. Haitians call it ‘Vodou on the road’, a victory of the spirit against the spectres of slavery.\n\nIn History\n\n31 January 1942: Derek Jarman, filmmaker, writer, artist, gardener and gay rights activist, is born Michael Derek Elworthy Jarman in London. A cinematic alchemist, Jarman’s interest in Renaissance occult philosophy, prompted by his readings of Jung, permeates his magical approach to film-making. His first film Jubilee (1978), ‘Britain’s only decent punk film’, features a time-travelling John Dee.\n\n9 February 1944: Alice Walker, novelist, short story writer, poet and activist, is born in Putnam County, Georgia. Through her work on Vodou for The Revenge of Hannah Kemhuff, she discovers Zora Neale Hurston, bringing her writing to a new generation. ‘We do carry an inner light, an inner compass and the reason we don’t know we carry it is because we’ve been distracted.’\n\n16 February 1878: Pamela Colman Smith, artist, writer and occultist, is born in Pimlico, London. Also known as Pixie, Smith illustrated and brought to life the Rider-Waite tarot deck. Still the most popular 78-card deck in use today, other suggested names for this set to reflect her essential contribution include the Rider-Waite-Smith, Waite-Smith and Waite-Colman- Smith. ‘Find eyes within, look for the door into the unknown country.’\n\n18 February 1934: Audre Lorde, feminist, writer, poet and teacher, is born Audrey Geraldine Lorde in New York City. Lorde defied ways of knowing defined by ‘racist, patriarchal, and anti-erotic society’ by drawing on the I Ching, tarot and traditions of African goddesses and warriors.\n\nFull Moon Resident: Sougwen Chung\n\nImage: Sougwen Chung, 2024, The (Gaian) Earth is a (High Stakes) Stage. Courtesy of the artist.\n\nFive and Nine: Tarotscope\n\nImage: AX Mina.\n\nMonthly tarotscopes are produced in partnership with Five and Nine, a podcast and newsletter at the crossroads of magic, work and economic justice.\n\nThis tarotscope was read using a miniature version of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, bringing us back to the basics. It’s a general reading for the collective, using only the tarot, in which we present cards for the different elements. These readings were drawn in Brooklyn in this first month of the Strength Year and twelfth month of the Rabbit Year, a moment of overlapping calendrical systems and a chill in the air.\n\nTarot Reading\n\nPast: Four of Pentacles (Reversed)\n\nPresent: Ten of Wands\n\nFuture: The Devil\n\nAs this period of the Full Moon Journal comes to a close, so do these tarotscopes in their current incarnation. We read these cards in the general sense of ‘past’, to whenever you decided to sign up for this membership, and to a future of indeterminate length ahead. The elemental reading provides you with a tool or energy to keep in mind as we move into the future.\n\nWhen you started this journey, you had to let go of a tightness around money often represented in the Four of Pentacles. By opening the coffers of both your wallet and your time, you stepped into a journey of awakening and discovery. Perhaps now, as the Ten of Wands suggests, you find yourself full with the magic you are working with, and the current conditions of living.\n\nThe future now asks you to embrace The Devil. To challenge the chains that bind you. To explore the mischief in your magic. We go forth into an unknown world, and these times call for thinking outside the usual barriers and strictures. Let your shadow guide you.\n\nFire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)\n\nA Resource: The Hierophant\n\nThis holy figure raises their hand like The Devil. See these not as opposites but rather as complements – your angelic and diabolic natures can work together to create powerful magic. Consider the fire that guides your life purpose and explore all its facets, the ones you are proud of and the ones that bring you shame. All sides are you, and you are all sides.\n\nEarth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)\n\nA Resource: Two of Wands\n\nThe whole world is before you and you see the whole world. For now, the journey ahead is a place of study, a way of grounding for the task at hand. Make plans and consider all options. Let the earth hold you in these uncertain times. Your ability to provide care and calm is a gift to many.\n\nAir (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)\n\nA Resource: Eight of Wands\n\nNow is the time to align your many skills and endeavours in a direction of your choosing – or a direction that feels right in this moment. When you feel ease, know that your guides are sending a message for this next stage of your journey. May the winds carry you with wisdom and discernment.\n\nWater (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)\n\nA Resource: Five of Cups\n\nWhat did you learn from the grief you carried in December? Quite likely, this grief is interspersed with moments of joy and clarity. The spirit of the Sun is not that the difficult times have passed, but rather that they have given us lessons to help us see with greater clarity.\n\nContributor-at-Large: So Mayer\n\nWhere We Belong

physical institution for their Memory of the World archive.\n\nCornucopia, ‘the horn of plenty’ is a symbol of abundance and overflow. It is descriptive of the exponential amount of data generated in the digital age. Presented as a large-scale media installation, Codex Cornucopia explores an ecology of images, both historical and subjective, through a whimsical firework display of images and sound. Constructing the work using a game engine simulation, facsimiles are located within symbolic scenographies inspired by Memory Theatres, ancient mnemonic systems that have arguably shaped the imaginary of the internet.\n\nThe images featured here are print editions from the virtual simulation. These have been printed, layered, burned, and re-photographed in a recursive process that reflects the life cycle of image-making. Through the portals, erasures and ruptures produced by fire, palimpsest landscapes emerge as the unstable grounds on which we build futures.\n\nWorks:\n\nLabyrinth, Codex Cornucopia, print edition, 2024.\n\nLotus, Codex Cornucopia, print edition, 2024.\n\nOracle, Codex Cornucopia, print edition, 2024.\n\nSeedpod I, Codex Cornucopia, print edition, 2024.\n\nSeedpod II, Codex Cornucopia, print edition, 2024.\n\nSaskia Vogel: Dead to the World but in the Centre of Life\n\nImage: dead to the world but in the centre of life, 2023, midjourney collaboration with JG\n\nI met Sister Andrea, the nun in my family, at my aunt’s funeral when I was perhaps not yet a teen. I remember being compelled by the description of her calling and spent a fever age dreaming of one of my own. Hildegard and her herbs in the garden, cold stone walls, enclosure. An impossible yearning to be called by God, as even then I supposed I sensed something of my own carnality.\n\nAt the residency in Princeton, a fissure had already begun its course through the everyday. Images of the 17 January 1994 earthquake in LA: the static crack of concrete, the desert highway split. There it was, widening. A car and driver stuck on an island slab. Patience. But in that protected space, the heavy air summer-thick with cicada song and then the sudden eerie dark and gold of autumn, a dynamic sort of solitude arose. On the phone, I told my father, who at one point was to be a man of the cloth: All I want is to be close to the mysteries, channel, interpret, synthesise, write. It was all very grand, but it was decisive. (The cracks.) A turn towards abundance, a turn towards softer soil, how to household with my resources alongside being a mother and a wife. I heard someone describe the anchoress as ‘dead to the world but in the centre of life’. Yearning.\n\nI will make myself an anchorhold, I thought. One eye on the altar, the other on the town square. I met Sarah at a dinner and she showed me an illumination from Hildegard’s Scivias (1151), the one in which she is shown receiving a vision, cosmic tentacles. I opened the book of the Garden of Cosmic Speculation back up and thought about the gates we pass through to clear the mind and emerge with our perceptions opened. Unable to focus on a translation, I texted JG my thoughts and he responded with this. With her. I watch her storm the bluffs in sea spray, and I hold her, I hold her in mind. I let it all course through me.\n\nAlice Spawls: Four Modes of Transcendence\n\nImage: Alice Spawls, image representing four modes of transcendence: sacrifice, creativity, astrology and the natural world.\n\nAlice Spawls is co-editor of the London Review of Books and a publisher at Silver Press.\n\nNathalie Seidl: Ember\n\nIn rural Austria, young women are the primary spectators of hypermasculine Krampus folklore traditions.

But, whenever hunger started to flit around the edges, it was much more pleasant to give in to its pangs and dig into one of my mother’s standard Deep South dishes made with vegetables grown in our large family garden. After forty years of not living in Alabama, the meal I most often try to replicate is a variation of my mother’s fried green tomatoes and okra (lightly dusted in cornmeal), collards (braised with a rasher of bacon), black-eyed peas (stewed with bacon, garlic and thyme), and a corn pone (cornbread made only with water, baked to crispy perfection in a well-seasoned iron skillet). The shape of that meal holds a sense of wellbeing, solace, and stability lacking in my endlessly nomadic adult life.\n\nThe winters I spent in Moscow during the twilight years of the Soviet Union were my first and only experiences with anything remotely resembling food insecurity. When I arrived for the first time in January 1987, the slow-moving Soviet command economy was colliding with several consecutive years of crop failure. I knew the food situation in the USSR would be challenging. I had seen the endless American news footage of Soviet citizens queuing for hours in brutally freezing temperatures to buy a loaf of bread or a head of cabbage.\n\nIn Moscow, the cafeteria of my dorm served three meals a day. Breakfast was the most neutral. I never missed it. There were various porridges or kashas (oatmeal, buckwheat, millet, or cream of wheat) cooked in milk, swimming in butter and loaded with sugar. Slices of Borodinsky bread, (the classic Russian black rye bread baked with molasses and encrusted with coriander seeds), butter, strong black tea and compote (a drink made from boiling dried fruit) rounded out the morning repast.\n\nAt lunch and dinner, they served thin, oily soups swimming with mystery meats and malodorous cabbage, a slice each of white bread, pale porous cheese and kolbasa washed down with more compote and black tea. The produce used to make these meals illustrated the reality of ‘second freshness’; a grade of food served in the buffet of the Variety Theatre Bulgakov describes in Master and Margarita. ‘Freshness can only be one grade—the first which is also the last. If the sturgeon has a rating of second freshness, it means it’s rotten!’\n\nI frequently skipped either lunch or dinner and ate peanut butter sandwiches with the large jar of crunchy Jif I’d brought with me from Alabama.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of culinary monotony, I wanted to cook a warm satisfying meal for myself in the communal kitchen of the dorm. To do this, I ventured out into the January cold to do a food shop. I trudged through the snow drifts from one shop to another, all called Produkty (Produce). They were indistinguishable: jaundiced overhead lighting, green walls sadly tiled in white from floor to eye level, and vitrines vacant of anything edible apart from a limited selection of unidentifiable goods in cans and paper packages. The vitrines were manned by women in white butcher smocks and chef hats wearing a Soviet style of Birkenstocks with white socks. Unceremoniously shoved in the corner, like second string players, were tall wire cages on castors stacked high with heads of anemic-looking cabbage. Surprisingly there were few smells in these places; only a sooty aroma, omnipresent in Soviet public spaces. It was a mixture of poorly refined petrol, dust, ink, city grime and cheap tobacco.\n\nThis was the first time I’d tried to shop in a Soviet food store. I was extremely nervous. The stone-faced women behind the counters seemed so unapproachable. What if my Russian is not good enough? What if I don't understand them? What if they don't understand me? Gathering up my courage I opened my mouth to speak in Russian…\n\n‘Devushka*, I'm listening!’ one of the women pronounced in Russian.\n\nTaken aback by her abruptness, I replied in my best Russian, ‘I would like a jar of tomatoes please**.’\n\n‘You mean lecho?’\n\n‘Well… probably… uh… yes. Lecho please.’\n\n‘What else?’\n\n‘What's in the white paper packages?’ I pointed at the small stack on a shelf behind the saleswoman.\n\n‘Don't point – it's rude. Rice – Second Sort.’\n\n‘Oh, I'm sorry… then please… in addition… one packet of rice. Please.’\n\n‘Anything else?’\n\n‘Is there anything else?’\n\n‘Devushka, can you not see for yourself?’\n\n‘Well… yes… maybe. I don’t know. Probably. That’s all.’\n\nShe calculated on an abacus, wrote a sum on a small piece of paper and handed me the check. ‘Please.’\n\nI was having trouble navigating the nuances of this profusion of ‘pleases’. The same Russian word, pozhaluista, means please and you’re welcome.\n\nI counted out the exact change in coins and handed it over the counter to her. ‘Nyet! Devushka, that’s not how it’s done! We don’t take money here! Pay at the cash register.’\n\n‘Forgive me… okay… I’m sorry.’\n\nI looked in the direction she indicated. Close to the entrance was a booth slightly elevated where a woman – identical to the women behind the vitrine except that her smock was sheathed in a thick home-spun sweater – sat under a marquee, KACCA, announcing her function. I approached the booth sliding my check and change across a well-worn indention of marble under a pane of glass separating the cashier from the apparently menacing public.\n\n‘Could I pay please?’ I asked.\n\nThe cashier silently took my check and change. In one smooth movement, she punched the sum into an antiquated cash register, jerked a lever that printed out the receipt and released a drawer into which she deposited the coins. Never once looking at me, she closed the drawer and returned the proof of purchase to me via the slight dip under the glass.\n\n‘Please,’ she impassively muttered, staring not at me but out the windows of the shop.\n\n‘Spasibo,’ I replied.\n\n‘Here. I paid. Please.’ I returned the receipt to the woman behind the counter. She checked that the sum was correct and stabbed the receipt definitively on a spike closing the transaction.\n\n‘Please,’ she replied, shoving the goods toward me.\n\n‘Spasibo... dosvedanya.’*** I gathered up the glass jar of lecho and the paper package stamped ‘Rice­­ – Second Sort’, placing them in my plastic Urban Outfitters shopping bag brought from the US. I was relieved that the interaction was over and that I remembered to bring my own bag.\n\nI managed to create a staple dish – a Spanish rice of sorts – from these two regularly available ingredients. Many of the grains of the second sort rice were crushed. It was heavily riddled with dust, grit and twigs, so I had to carefully sort it and wash it before cooking. I had never seen anything close to rice that damaged and dirty sold in the US. The lecho was a popular Hungarian import. A pleasing mellow sauce, it was made with chunky tomatoes, sweet yellow peppers, onions and garlic and sold in jars and cans of various sizes. I quickly fried the rice in sunflower oil. Then, watering down the lecho slightly, I poured it into the pan and simmered the rice. This simple dish was quite satisfying and could be fixed in a pinch. It conjured up feelings of muggy heat, sunshine, and my grandmother Dolly’s prize-winning Alabama heirloom tomatoes.\n\nIn addition to the cafeteria, there was also a kafe-bar located in a remote corner of the Pushkin Institute. You could only get there by leaving the building through the front entrance and walking along a path through the snow around to the back of the building. The student kafe-bar – in both nomenclature and appearance – was like cafe-bars found all over the USSR: Boney M and Modern Talking played on an endless loop; dark brown panelling and dim, red-shaded lamps created a den-like ambience; random Soviet and Western tchotchkes (more often than not leftover souvenirs from the 1980 Moscow Olympics and bottles of locally produced Pepsi-Cola) occupied pride of place on the sparsely adorned shelves. The name, kafe-bar, was deceptive. Like produkty: the signifier did not guarantee the presence of the signified. Although coffee was always on the menu, there was rarely food and never alcohol. This was the middle of Gorbachev’s campaign of dry law aimed at curbing ruinous rates of alcoholism. In spite of these deficits, students loved to hang out here, even if it meant bundling up to walk only twenty metres in the subzero temperatures.\n\nOpening the hidden-side door, you were hit by a wall of warmth and the smell of coffee and cardomom. It was the fragrance of Turkish-style coffee brewing in a jezbeh – a small aluminium pot with a long handle stirred around in a tray of piping hot sand – and served in an espresso cup with a generous spoonful of sugar. The cardamom mellowed out the nutty bitterness of the coffee. When drained, the coffee left a thick sludge at the bottom of the cup. Later I met Russians who could divine fortunes from this amorphous mess.\n\nOccasionally the kafe-bar would have keks, toothsome treats similar to pound cake: yellow, dense and buttery. They were the shape and size of muffins and dotted with raisins. The crust was crunchy. The thick and pungent coffee complemented the keks’ velvety richness punctuated with gummy raisins. When available I would buy at least five, stashing the extras away for snowy days; they were still delicious when mildly stale.\n\nEven now the memory of these flavours is vivid. Relative and temporary privation certainly enhanced my sense of taste and appreciation for small simple pleasures; hits of carbs and caffeine, the stored warmth of sun-ripened tomatoes gave shape to winter hungers and youth’s desires.\n\nGlossary\n\n*Devushka –literally ‘girl’, is a standard ‘polite’ term to address any female who does not look elderly – and even then it is used to appear affectionate.\n\n**The same Russian word, pozhaluista, is used for ‘please’ and ‘you’re welcome’.\n\n*** Spasibo… dosvedanya – ‘thank you’ and… ‘goodbye’.\n\nBorn and raised in a small town in Alabama, as a teenager Suzy Mintz moved with her family to West Germany. There she graduated from an American high school and returned to the US to continue her higher education. A child of the Cold War and a Cold Warrior (her father worked for the US Department of Defense), she received bachelor's and master's degrees in Russian Studies from University of Texas and Harvard University, respectively.\n\nFor over thirty years, Suzy spent long periods living in Moscow, where she worked in a variety of capacities: running an office of Western economists – headed by Jeffrey Sachs – consulting Boris Yeltsin's first government on economic reform; curating a chamber music series for the Kremlin Museum; serving as a communications consultant to Gazprom; and managing ballet stars, Natalia Osipova and Sergei Polunin. She left Moscow in 2016 and moved to London in 2018 to pursue her creative writing career at City, University of London. In 2021, she received her MA with a Distinction in Creative Writing Non-fiction from City. Suzy has remained in London and is currently working on two personal memoirs about her life in Russia. One recounts her experiences in the Soviet underground arts and music scene during perestroika. The other examines the unravelling of her two-decade long marriage to a Muscovite with a high-profile establishment job against the backdrop of the disintegration of Ukrainian-Russian relations.\n\nTara Aghdashloo: Beehive\n\nI have been listening to your signs\n\nRevealing themselves, inconspicuously\n\nWith the elegant immodesty of a flower in bloom.\n\nI allowed them to water my leaves\n\nAnd satiate my roots\n\nAnd dance along my stems like some kind of\n\nMagical nectarine\n\nBut then...\n\nFalse, surreptitious oracles\n\nEntering the hive, cladded in the queen’s cloak\n\nThey are warm, like a towel after a swim\n\nAnd our feast is feverish.\n\nYet my stomach warns me\n\nNot my eyes\n\nNor my hands\n\nOr my friends\n\nIt is a seed inside my stomach that speaks.\n\nI’m planted in solitude, I can hear the sounds of violence\n\nI’m the perennial flower, I’m inviting you in\n\nRemain, be still\n\nRemember, please\n\nThat the beehive\n\nAlways wins.\n\nTree Carr: Dream Diary\n\nLucid Dream – 16 Jan 2024\n\nI discovered a black dot on the outer part of my right hand between my thumb and index finger. I examined the black dot and noticed a bit of a wooden vine poking out. I pulled on the bit of vine and it began to come out. I stood there pulling and noticed that the vine was dead. It was black and devoid of life.\n\nIt just kept on coming out as I pulled. A really really long vine! I was astounded and disturbed and the strong emotions made me go lucid within the dream.\n\nI just kept thinking: How was this dead vine inside of my body and how I had never known about it. And how did it get there?! And how did it all fit in there within my body!?\n\nI decided to keep on pulling it out. At one point the vine broke off. There was a huge amount of dead vine laying on the floor. I thought that was it. It was done. I had removed it from\n\nmy body. But then I looked back at the black hole on my hand and I could see that there was some fragment of the vine still left there.\n\nI carefully poked my finger into the hole and got hold of the vine fragment. Then I pulled some more. More vine! It just kept on coming out as I pulled. And then voila! It reached the final end of the vine, which had a bushy top to it.\n\nThen I knew for certain that all the dead vine was removed from me. So much vine was on the floor! I felt astonished and realised that I removed something symbolically ‘dead’ from my life. Some kind of ‘negative fragment’ that needed removal.\n\nI then looked back at my hand and the black hole that was there was gone. It only looked like an open, empty fleshy hole much like how it looks after a pore has expelled a blackhead.\n\nI woke up feeling mesmerised. Like I had experienced a healing. Like something was removed from me. Like I had finished a cycle of completion and was ready to move on to the next chapter.\n\nGray Crawford: Astrology for the Full Moon in Sagittarius\n\nThe full moon is the peak moment of the lunar cycle: illuminating issues, distributing revelations and bringing matters to a head. Likewise, the summer solstice is one of the peak moments of the year, in which the sun reaches its greatest height and offers the longest day. In the northern hemisphere, the solstice occurs on 21 June, just a few days after the new moon in Gemini, placing it at the centre of the lunar month – the astrological period stretching from the full moon in Sagittarius on 4 June through the full moon in Capricorn on 3 July. As we head toward this pivot of the year, the Sagittarius full moon fosters a lively pace full of fiery visions, which can lead to exciting creative developments. Around this time, it is important to make space for grounding and mindfulness, in order to clarify our goals and directions.\n\nAround the same time as the Sagittarius full moon, Venus will reach her greatest height as an evening star, marking a period in which she will begin slowing down in speed while becoming increasingly bright at night. Fittingly, on 5 June – the same time that Venus is enthroned at her greatest height – she will also enter the queenly sign of Leo. Due to Venus stationing retrograde on 23 July, the planet of love, desire and creativity will remain in Leo from 5 June until 9 October. As we begin to adjust to the extended journey of Venus in the home of the sun, she will come closer to Earth in her orbit, amplifying desires and creative impulses. We have a long road of Venus in Leo ahead, one that will shake things up in order to rebalance the harmony of relational and creative elements. With Venus journeying through Leo alongside Mars in the month ahead, be aware that dramatic issues may be brought to light that will take time to fully work out.\n\nThe next major astrological shift will come a week after the full moon, when Mercury enters its home sign Gemini on 11 June. On the same day, Pluto will backtrack from Aquarius into Capricorn. Mercury will remain in Gemini from 11 June through 27 June, offering a productive period for asking questions while experimenting with potential directions to pursue in the month ahead. Mercury in Gemini excels at making connections, synthesising ideas, and quickly forging pathways of informational exchange between entities of all types. Mercury in Gemini is also flexible and can help bring realisations of where we need to change course and how to make it happen. Pluto returning to Capricorn brings an end to the first instalment of its transit through Aquarius, which began on 23 March, and could demand a re-encounter with deep-seated issues that were more of a focus during the first three months of the year when Pluto was briefly in Capricorn.\n\nThe new moon in Gemini occurs on 18 June, just a few days before the solstice on 21 June, heralding a series of crucial astrological aspects. At this time, Saturn in Pisces will saturate the astrological atmosphere due to stationing retrograde on 17 June, demanding a confrontation with your present use of time and space. Saturn brings tests that take time and will ultimately help lay the foundation of subsequent creations. Saturn will remain retrograde until 4 November, offering a period in which to re-evaluate the growth experienced during the first half of the year. At the same time Saturn stations, it will form a harmonious sextile with Jupiter in Taurus. This sextile is the first major aspect Saturn and Jupiter have formed since their major conjunction at the end of 2020. Thus the Gemini new moon will be helpful not only in orienting toward the coming month, but in reflecting upon everything that has happened since 2020 while re-conceptualising plans for the years ahead.\n\nThere will be a heightened mental and imaginative atmosphere from the solstice until the full moon in Capricorn on 3 July. After Mercury enters the watery sign of Cancer on 27 June, the star of Hermes will form harmonious aspects with both Saturn (on 29 June) and Jupiter (on 1 July). At the same time, Mercury will become reanimated by a conjunction with the sun, also on 1 July. Moreover, Neptune in Pisces will incite a tidal wave of imaginal activation at the same time due to stationing retrograde on 30 June. As a result, the earthy pragmatism of the full Moon in Capricorn can help in processing ideas and revelations while adding elements of practical functionality to whatever wild ideas may take root at this time. With the Capricorn full moon forming an opposition with Mercury, take the time needed to question motives and potential directions while digging deeper into any further research required in the formulation of long-term plans.\n\nNotes from the Ignota Diary\n\nImage: Daisy Rickman, Setting Sun at the Nine Maidens, 2022. Sounds and images by Daisy are published in this month's offerings for members of The Mountain.\n\nCelebrations and festivals\n\nThis month’s Full Moon Journal is published in anticipation of the northern hemisphere’s summer solstice, also known as midsummer, when the day is the longest and the night shortest. The triumph of the sun offers fulfilment, fruition and the sharing of its bounty.\n\nOn 10 June is Nalukataq (the North Slope Borough, Alaska). On this day Iñupiat whaling communities give thanks to the whales and celebrate the success of the hunting season. Festivities include the blanket dance, when the community throws a dancer in the air using a huge stretched trampoline of seal skins.\n\n27–28 June 2023 is Day of Arafah, which occurs on the second day of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. At dawn, pilgrims make their way to a granite plain southeast of Mecca where Muhammad gave his last sermon. It is the most important day of Hajj; here they ‘stand before God’ in contemplative vigil from noon to sunset.\n\nAround 24 June, is Inti Raymi, traditional Inca solar adoration in honour of the god Inti, which occurs during the southern hemisphere’s winter solstice. During the Inca empire, people gathered in Cusco on the winter solstice (on this date in the southern hemisphere). Llamas were sacrificed and the main square ran with blood and beer. Coca leaves were read and burnt during festivities held from dawn to dusk. Still celebrated in Indigenous cultures throughout the Andes.\n\nIn Nature\n\nEarly June is a good time to forage dandelions (taraxacum officinale). A plant of Jupiter, although attributed to Venus by Nicholas Culpeper. Pick the young flowers only and remove the green base to avoid bitterness. Good for teas, wines, vinegars and jellies. The roots can be foraged in autumn; they have a chthonic character and in root work are used for necromancy.\n\nThroughout the month elderflowers (sambucus nigra) are in bloom. Pick the flower heads in the morning on a sunny day, about ten or fifteen should suffice. Clean your tools and surfaces thoroughly, dissolve sugar in water, add the flowers, some lemon juice and wine yeast (or experiment with wild yeast). Leave to ferment for about a week, then strain through a muslin cloth and transfer to a new container with an airlock. You can drink it after a couple of weeks but it gets better with time, if you can wait. Calms anxieties and fears, stimulates joy and aids recovery for yourself or others. Used for protection, prosperity and to encourage good health.\n\nLate June is a good time to gather the leaves and bark of the ash (fraxinus excelsior), a solar tree sometimes attributed to Venus. Hesiod claimed the first man was born from the ash tree and Yggdrasil, the world tree of the Norse, was an ash. The bark has a plethora of medicinal properties and the wood is traditionally used to make besoms, wands and staves. Sleep with the leaves under your pillow for prophetic dreams or leave in a bowl of water overnight to stave off illness.\n\nSignificant dates\n\n13 June 1866: Aby Warburg, historian of art and ideas, is born in Hamburg, Germany. Founder of the Warburg Institute, where the beautiful library contains much occult, anthropological, and historical knowledge, he placed magic at the centre of the study of iconography and the moving image. Mnemosyne Atlas, his last, unfinished work, maps constellations of symbolic images through an associative method of images to trace ‘the afterlife of antiquity’.\n\n16 June 1924: Idries Shah, author and teacher in the Sufi tradition, is born in Simla, India. Through his many books and translations of classical Sufi literature, he brings Sufi ideas to the West. Friends with the poet Robert Graves and with Gerald Gardner, during his lifetime Shah held court for anyone interested in Sufism at the Cosmo restaurant in North London every Tuesday evening.\n\n17 June 1951: Starhawk, neo-pagan, ecofeminist and activist, is born Miriam Simos in St. Paul, Minnesota. ‘Because everything is interdependent, there are no simple, single causes and effects. Every action creates not just an equal and opposite reaction, but a web of reverberating consequences.’\n\n22 June 1947: Octavia Butler, feminist and visionary science fiction writer, is born in Pasadena, California. Her pioneering work transforms the landscape of speculative writing, often blending elements of science fiction and African American spiritualism. ‘All that you touch You Change/ All that you Change Changes you/The only lasting truth Is Change/ God Is Change.’\n\n23 June 1889: birthday or Anna Akhmatova, poet, translator and memoirist, as Anna Andreyevna Gorenka in Odessa, Ukraine. In August 1946, Akhmatova is denounced by the Central Committee of the CPSU and publicly castigated as ‘half harlot, half nun’ for the ‘eroticism, mysticism and political indifference’ of her poetry, deemed ‘alien to the Soviet people’. ‘I’m silent. Silently, I’m ready. To be transformed, earth, into you.’\n\nArtist in Residence: Sougwen Chung\n\nImage: Sougwen Chung, Studies for a Flora Rearing Agricultural Network, 2023.\n\nOver the next six lunations, artist Sougwen Chung will contribute selections from her archive as our latest Full Moon Resident, taking over from Tai Shani.\n\nFive and Nine: Tarotscope\n\nImage: AX Mina.\n\nMonthly tarotscopes are produced in partnership with Five and Nine, a podcast and newsletter at the crossroads of magic, work and economic justice.\n\nThis tarotscope is a general reading for the collective, using a combination of the I Ching and tarot, in which we present tarot cards for the different elements. Read for the elements calling to you now, whether that’s associated with your Sun, rising or Moon sign, or one speaking to you at this time in your life.\n\nThis month as the summer solstice approaches, the focus is on the tarot. The tarot was read using the Mixed Signals Tarot by BlinkPopShift, and using a gate-lock-key spread. The Gate represents the invitation, the Lock a blocker or something to work through, and the Key a tool or set of tools to help you. Each element receives two keys, two energies to keep in mind as you move forward. Where reversals appear, they are read not as blocked or reversed energy per se (for that would foster binary thinking) but rather energy to pay close attention to.\n\nThese readings were channelled while extending reiki and protective energy to the deck and by extension to anyone receiving the messages here, in this sixth month of the Chariot Year and fourth month of the Rabbit Year.\n\nTarot Reading\n\nGate: Justice (reversed)\n\nLock: Nine of Swords\n\nThe world around has been feeling unjust for quite some time. The Gate, the Justice card reversed, is a call to pay attention, to work through it, to find a way forward for yourself and your loved ones in a way that feels right for you. These might mean working outside your day-to-day comforts and allowing the fires of righteous anger to guide you, or it might mean retreating inward to recharge and re-energise amidst swiftly changing circumstances. Either way, the chain must be broken.\n\nWhat you’ll need to work through is a gnawing sense of anxiety. The Lock, the Nine of Swords, is here depicted a hand trying to juggle many pens, markers and pencils. You see both the opportunity and the threat of this historic moment, and that can foster a sense of overwhelm that makes it difficult to move forward. Look to the Keys for your sign to identify some tools to work with this energy. The call of Justice is strong, but justice is rarely achieved without a struggle.\n\nFire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)\n\nThe Magician (reversed)\n\nTen of Stones (reversed) – aka the Ten of Pentacles\n\nIt is the nature of your sign’s energy to want to leap forth and take action. Allow yourself a moment of pause before you do. The Ten of Stones is a reminder to take an assessment of the many gifts and tools you’ve placed around you, the world you’ve built for yourself. The Magician is a reminder to then be strategic about which ones you deploy. Once you have certainty, very little can stop you.\n\nEarth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)\n\nFive of Stones (reversed)\n\nEight of Swords\n\nThese two cards together tell a story of Earth-like grounding that invites sifting, sorting and muddling through. Lay out your stones. The Five of Stones is a reminder that the path you set for yourself enables exploration while also excluding other possibilities. Few of these decisions require permanence, but they benefit from tenderly allowing yourself the journey forth. The Eight of Swords asks you to grapple with the fears that hold you back. The problem right now is that each pencil in your toolkit looks mostly the same, sharpened and ready to go but untouched. Pick each one up and let its energy guide you. The only way forward in the pursuit of justice is forward.\n\nAir (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)\n\nFive of Wands (reversed)\n\nThree of Wands (reversed)\n\nYour sign lives and thrives in the mind and the Wands are a reminder to allow the spirit to shine through. The Five of Wands invites you to consider those around you and provide a spark. What does it feel like to work with them, to call in their energy into your life as you gather your resources in your path? The Three of Wands, depicted here as a tree growing leaves, is a reminder of the importance of the journey now sprouting before you. Reversed, it resembles roots more than shoots, which raises a question: what new foundations are you allowing to grow to hold you in a new way?\n\nWater (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)\n\nSeven of Cups\n\nThe World (reversed)\n\nThe Seven of Cups asks you to identify and name each emotion you’re experiencing in this moment. What is their nose, their aroma, that extends into your life? Is it sweet, is it sour? Does it refresh, does it stifle? You’ve come far in your journey, and the World tells us that the cycle is ready to begin anew. Always changing, always flowing – the best we can do is keep mindful of the slings and arrows of life and replenish the cup where we can.\n\nAmy Hale: Contributor-at-Large\n\nIgnota welcomes our fourteenth Contributor-at-large, writer and anthropologist Amy Hale. In this month’s Full Moon Journal, Amy shares an essay on the Cornish artist and occultist Ithell Colquhoun, exploring her relationship with the ancient megaliths of Penwith.\n\nIn 1979 Ithell Colquhoun published an essay in Sangreal magazine outlining her theories about the energies which flow under sacred sites, and how one might tap into them:\n\nOver the earth’s surface are to be found localities which the ancients called ‘Fountains out of Hecate.’ To tap these chthonic power-centres it is essential to be near them at the times when they erupt as geysers of energy. Certain places have an affinity with certain times—of the day, of the week, of the year, of the cycle. Many of these are still to be discovered, or rediscovered; mythology and folklore provide clues, calendrical observances being especially useful. One’s own hunches about the atmosphere of certain places are often worth following up. Short of becoming a wandering ‘venerable,’ it is important to live (or at least occasionally to stay) near one of these ‘Fountains.’ In this way one can gradually come to know the seasons when its stream of power wells up most strongly. One can immerse oneself in it, even if one lacks the knowledge to direct it to other purposes. [1]\n\nThere is no shortage of ‘Fountains of Hecate’ in West Cornwall. The Neolithic/Bronze Age stone monuments dotting the landscape of Cornwall have inspired the antiquarian and esoteric imagination in Britain since at least the seventeenth century, when early researchers linked them to the Druids and hypothesized that these were the ritual or astronomical sites of the ancient Britons. Everyone from researchers to spiritual pilgrims has tried to penetrate the mysteries of these sites, recover their original function, and importantly tap into whatever energies they may be harnessing. Cornwall has one of the densest concentrations of megalithic monuments in Western Europe, which has only added to the mystical lure of the area and reinforced the belief that there is something ancient and powerful lurking just below the earth. Colquhoun was evidently similarly stricken with the mystical fascination around these monuments and she produced many studies of Cornish stones over the central decades of her life. Around 1940 Colquhoun completed some quite rough watercolour sketches of a couple of monuments located in West Cornwall known as the Men an Tol and Lanyon Quoit, although at this stage there is no further evidence of the complexity of her thought around these worked. Within a couple of years, however, Colquhoun develops some unique full studies of the Nine Maidens/Merry Maidens and the Men an Tol that suggest the merging of a number of complex esoteric theories about the nature and role of the monuments, ranging from wells of energy coming from the earth to, potentially, her researches into other dimensions.\n\nIn 1941/42 Colquhoun completed two outstanding paintings of Neolithic or Bronze Age monuments, The Dance of the Nine Opals and The Sunset Birth which display the most sophisticated articulation of Colquhoun’s theories around sacred sites and which merit slightly more discussion than some of her other sacred landscape works. In these luminous and visually complicated paintings, she explored a wealth of ideas around megalithic monuments, primarily how they function as energy conduits at points in the earth that can act upon the energy centres present in the human body. The paintings become significant in the ways that we can chart how they intersect with her wider esoteric thinking at the time. In the early 1940s, Colquhoun was concentrating theoretically and artistically on energy flows and portals and these take shape in a number of her artistic projects at the time, including these particular works on Cornish stone monuments. These complex paintings include a number of ideas and theories that Colquhoun was working on quite feverishly, yet they never seemed to blossom into a major body of work regarding her theories about sacred landscapes. Her lifelong obsession with the fourth dimension and tesseracts also gets reflected in the sketches of Dance of the Nine Opals. These paintings are also early visual articulations of what Colquhoun would later poetically refer to as ‘the living stones’, a phrase which may have had its source in Ouspensky’s Tertium Organium, with a call back to Peter 2:5: ‘Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.’ [2]\n\nIn these paintings, we see a synthesis of the theories she was working with concerning extra dimensions and energy flows that she applied to human bodies and also landscapes. We can see a confluence of her work on tesseracts, sex magic and sacred sites. In some watercolour sketches from around 1941 Colquhoun encapsulates these stone monuments within a tesseract using the same colour schemes that she used for her other tesseract and cube of space sketches. Was she suggesting that these megalithic monuments were also extradimensional portals? It is likely that this is how she viewed them, as vibrating, living, energetic sacred teachers that we can connect with and be transported by if only we can listen and cultivate the right relationships with them.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Colquhoun, “Pilgrimage.” Sangreal 2 no. 1, 1979. pp 29-31.\n\n[2]\n\nRasheeqa Ahmad, Elsa Cristofolini Hamaz and Paige Emery: St John’s Wort Ritual\n\nSt John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a nerve-restoring solar herb long used for alleviating mild to moderate depression; in the Middle Ages, it was a remedy for insanity. In cultures adhering to a solar year, this plant’s traditional use is for vivid dreams, protection during the night and warding off mental illness and unwanted spirits. Some say its Latin name Hypericum derives from association with the sun god and its flowering around the summer solstice (dedicated to the day of St. John in Christianity). The oil glands in the leaves, visible as tiny holes when held up to the light, give the species name of perforatum.\n\nIts deep, red oil, when infused in the midsummer sun, heals damaged nerve tissue and wounds, while its tea and tincture bring light where there is difficulty with darkness – a classic situation being winter melancholia. The late herbalist Christopher Hedley described it as appropriate if someone ‘needs to see the fairies’, but less so if already seeing them. It is also a useful antiviral with application in herpes and shingles.\n\nRitual\n\nGather St John’s wort flowers in a jar and cover them with olive oil. Meditate for as long as you feel is right to step deeper inside. Set an intention to connect with your truest self and for protection from darkness in all its guises. Speak your intention into the jar and seal it inside by closing the lid tightly, then set the jar on a sunny windowsill to absorb the light for three weeks. After this time, anoint yourself with the oil and remember your intention. Its sun-soaked vibrancy will adjust your eyes to brighter ways of seeing and vivify your dreaming.\n\nSoojin Chang: The Nurse\n\nImages: Soojin Chang, The Nurse (2020), still images.\n\nGaylene Gould: Black Mary’s Hole\n\nIn the 1600’s the River Fleet was in its heyday, running proudly from Hampstead all the way down to the city of London, past Bagnigge House just south of Kings Cross where they say Nell Gwynne entertained her lover, King Charles II. The river’s water trickled down through layers of soil and sand until it splashed against the London Clay Basin. With nowhere to go, the water bubbled up again, replete with rich ferrous oxide and minerals, creating a spine of healing water wells in the river’s wake. One such well was called Black Mary’s Hole, situated close to the fancy Bagnigge House. The well was said to cure eye afflictions and was purportedly managed by a Black woman called Mary Woolaston.\n\nArguably there isn’t a body that more reflects Gaia theory, developed by Lynn Margulis and James Lovelock, than bodies of water. Water carries the stories of the environment it traverses through. Urban rivers whisper the secrets of the city if we listen closely enough. Now driven underground, the Fleet carries memories of the healing wells that once ringed London, offering a balm to the growing, disease-ridden city. In the seventeenth century those healing wells were our physicians, our gathering places, our spaces of ritual.\n\nSt Chad’s Well sat close to Black Mary’s Hole and in his book Spas, Wells and Pleasure Gardens, James Stevens Curl describes: ‘There was miraculous water, quaffed by the bilious and other invalids who flocked to visit in crowds to drink at the cost of sixpence. The water there was a laxative. It was heated in a large cauldron and thrown off into glasses, a pint being considered actively purgative, mildly tonic and powerfully diuretic.’\n\nMaybe Black Mary’s Hole also had a vibe like this. Maybe Mary’s well offered a place of respite for the needy. Maybe Mary had her own spiritual practices, which meant that she could offer a little something special. Maybe, unlike St Chad, she honoured another deity, the Goddess Isis, who the Romans had brought with them to England. A Roman relic was found close to her well, after all.\n\nAnother book that mentions Black Mary’s Hole, The Legendary Lore of the Holy Wells of England by Richard Charles Hope, says: ‘Some say a black woman named Woolaston leased here a conduit to which the citizens resorted to drink the waters, and who kept a black cow, whose milk gentleman and ladies drank with the waters.’\n\nWater does not write its own history and rarely do Black women of the past. So while researching Mary’s shadowy story, we only have the words of men to go on and they flow quickly past and around her. They conflate her with the ‘Black Maries’ of the neighbouring St Mary’s Benedictine Nunnery despite the closing of the convent during the Reformation at least fifty years before Mary’s appearance. Probably the most compelling evidence that a Black woman did indeed run the well is the very strange title given to it: Black Mary’s Hole. It is highly unlikely that a well once run by nuns would be given such a sexually suggestive name even if those nuns were Catholic.\n\nPollution from industry eventually turned the Fleet rank. The Myddleton brothers who were key to the founding of the East India Company, practised their colonising enterprise on the founding of the New River, which eventually piped fresh water into London and put the wells out of business. Soon after this, Mary Woolaston died. The well was bricked over and so too were the memory of the healing waters and the mysterious woman who dispensed them.\n\nOver three hundred years later, I am now leading a project to revive Mary Woolaston and the spirit of her healing well, working with a team of Black women artists and members of the Calthorpe Community Gardens, which border the land that Mary Woolaston once tended. The community, caretaking and healing work that takes place at Calthorpe echoes the nourishing spirit of the water wells. To pay homage to the ancestor that watered the land before us, we will be creating a contemplative healing garden and permanent artwork in Mary’s honour. Through the tenacious historical research of Calthorpe member Emanuela Aru, we believe we have now located the actual spot where Black Mary’s Hole once was. A small circular scrub of land sits in the overgrown grounds of a housing estate just off the King’s Cross Road. When sitting in that spot, the noise of the traffic miraculously disappears and you are left in a well of peace. This project continues to draw many of us together in a community of care – a testament to the fact that, even when buried, the ancient healing waters beneath our feet continue to guide us.\n\nMirren Kessling: Solar Sigh\n\nToday’s full moon is linked closely to symbolism around the hawthorn tree and wild roses, both of which are associated with the power of the heart. With the summer solstice taking place on 21 June this month, this full moon is closely linked to the strength of the sun. Today is a day to explore and set intentions around powerful emotions and desires, and offer thanks to your own strength with all that you have brought into the world since winter.\n\nAs you read this, to mark this full moon I will be facilitating a monthly full moon meditation walk alongside my collaborator Yusef Sanei, a meditation teacher and wellbeing practitioner. Together with a group we’ve convened, we’ll be walking and meditating our way through Epping Forest in West Essex in the hopes of reaching its ‘Sunshine Plain’, a large glade amongst the ancient trees where the sun becomes visible again and the full strength of its rays can be felt. To connect with the plants associated with this full moon, we will be seeking out hawthorn trees that blossomed throughout the month of May, forest bathing underneath them. We will also look for freshly bloomed wild roses, whose faces we will meditate on with our eyes open.\n\nSummer solstice is a time where the sun stands still, which is a more literal translation of the word ‘solstice’. Today’s full moon is a chance to set short intentions to realise in time for this solstice. This month, as the sun reaches its full power on earth, some beings will feel energised by the extra hours of light and the solstice will be a time for them to seek a moment of stillness as the light reaches its peak. For others, the extra light can mean disturbed sleep and chaos. It’s an ideal moment to stay up into the night (or rise very early) and celebrate outdoors. There are lots of ways to connect to the sun on summer solstice such as gathering through the night at Stonehenge in Wiltshire and watching the sunrise from the Heel Stone. My personal practice is walking with the sun on winter and summer solstice, bookending each half of the year with a solar pilgrimage. This involves waking up early to meet the sun at sunrise just before 5 am, walking with it through much of the longest day before eventually watching it set late into the evening at around 9:30 pm. The time walking is a chance to connect to the landscape, forage Mugwort – a herbal aid to lucid dreaming – reflect and set intentions for the next half of the year.\n\n‘Astronomers generally agree that the sun’s total luminosity (output of energy as light) has increased during the past four billion years. They infer from this that the mean temperature of the surface of the earth ought to have risen correspondingly. But there is evidence from the fossil record that the Earth’s temperature has remained relatively stable. The Gaia hypothesis recognises this stability as property of life on the Earth’s surface.’ (Gaia and Philosophy, Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan).\n\nGaian philosophy attributes atmospheric regulation to the activities of organisms and microbes. This idea is the starting point for today’s offering, as well as the interconnectedness between us and celestial bodies, and the immense strength of the sun’s luminosity. With this in mind, I have designed a ‘solar sigh’, a breathwork exercise to help you connect to and regulate the radiance of the sun on the summer solstice and throughout the month ahead, with the intention that it helps you find some stillness in the heat. You can also settle your gaze on these solar and lunar votives I have drawn as you practice your solar sigh.\n\nFor those of you that would like to explore writing down your intentions, particularly around powerful emotions and strong desires on this full moon or summer solstice, I welcome you to print out these hand-drawn votives and write your intentions devised from this full moon and summer solstice around them.\n\nDownload the Solar Sigh breathwork booklet here.\n\nCanisia Lubrin: Geology Lesson 4\n\n(after Patricia Smith)\n\nthe voice command is wild\n\nas an avenue’s boast, both\n\nin a clear natural voice, a\n\ngirl who taught me to drip\n\nbefore she left all the soil\n\nand its stones asleep on\n\nmy chest or else, I garden,\n\na war for bone-weary boots\n\nto bury, except now the sun\n\npierces secular and she ends\n\nthe man, he bleeds, her girl\n\na truculent and floating plan,\n\nalready out the door, afro-first,\n\nshe just them bones she was\n\nborn with, is all, took with her\n\na dominion of horns and spell\n\nbooks, and seven recited rants,\n\nsome nights the songs are guns\n\nand she buries them in the neg-\n\nropolis, she’s been burned in the\n\nname of adulting, for droning down\n\nthe canticle with piss and a screech\n\nlike a world-toppling woman makin’ love\n\nOriginally published in Spells: 21st-Century Occult Poetry.\n\nJoel Kuennen: Objects of Interest\n\nImages: Joel Kuennen, Object of interest 700 e, 2023.\n\nEnter the Hyper-Scientific Program 2022, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). © Enter the Hyper-Scientific, EPFL; Photo: Riccardo Banfi.\n\nTree Carr: Dream Diary\n\n20 February 2021 – Lucid Dream / OBE / Sleep Paralysis\n\nFelt high vibration state and rolled out of my body onto the right side of the bed.\n\nI was looking at my bedroom wall.

Kriya practices use a combination of postures, breath, sound and meditation techniques to produce specific states of being. There are thousands of kriyas within the system of kriya yoga, and each one affects the body, mind and spirit in a unique and specialised way. Practising kriyas can produce physical and mental changes that allow the practitioner to access deeper states of mindfulness, harmony and expansion. Done every day (many of the practices are short and sweet) kriyas can help transform our physical and mental agility as well as our emotional wellbeing.\n\nThe key to practising kriya is in the meaning. We must complete the specific tasks and times for the kriya to be ‘complete’ and therefore receive the benefits to our system. As one of the kriya yoga masters says: ‘Keep up and you will be kept up!’\n\nPractices for the Solstices\n\nSolstices suggest a peak or an extreme. The lightest and the darkest moments of the year represent the lightest and darkest moments within us.\n\nFor the Summer Solstice: Trataka Meditation\n\nLight can manifest as exuberance, energy, lightheartedness, motivation. Practising at its peak allows us to be supported with the natural extra energy that is being beamed at us on the longest day of the year. A beautiful practice any time of the year but especially at the summer solstice is trataka, a simple meditation that connects us to the power of light, improves concentration and vision and has a purifying and invigorating effect. Trataka is a gazing practice that can direct attention to a symbol or yantra. A popular form is candle gazing: when looking at the flame, work on the capacity to see the flame and its light without hallucinating any images within the flame. Meditate on that radiance for 15-31 minutes, with as little blinking as possible.\n\nFind a quiet environment.\n\nSit in a comfortable position on the floor or a chair.\n\nPosition a candle about seven feet away.\n\nFocus your eyes on the flame and see the corona of light around the flame. See the area just under the hottest tip of the flame where there is a dark spot; both light and dark coexist at this point. Meditate on this.\n\nConcentrate at the middle brow point. This will stimulate the frontal lobes of the brain. Blink as little as possible.\n\nTo end, inhale deeply, close the eyelids, and put the image of the radiant light at the brow point of concentration.\n\nOriginally published in the Ignota Diary.\n\nKhairani Barokka: (before firewood prays, she hears)\n\na burning woman makes a shitty comrade\n\nthe smoke’s cumbersome, fire a safety hazard\n\nso what if the firemen gagged her with a gasoline rag, so—\n\nthey slit her with a lighter and threatened any decibels\n\non the arboreal gurney. enough times of facing angry shouts\n\nfor screaming, the sapling lost the ability to verbalise flames ‘appropriately’\n\nfor branches to remain ‘appropriate’ requires time’s reversal\n\nand denial of how often she bursts into the maw of a star\n\nwhy go back and back there, for kicks?\n\nwhy spread an inferno to flooding steppes\n\nblack clouds look like breath, her knifing chest\n\nno longer understands a divide of sky and flames\n\ntug an ash braid. see if it’s god in there,\n\nthe one her mother said lives inside her with the blades\n\nOriginally published in Altered States.\n\nThis month’s Full Moon Journal continues to celebrate Ignota's latest book, Gaia and Philosophy by Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan, exploring all themes Gaian and ecological.

Just as Beltane is a pivotal point in the year, so the eclipse will signify leaving one phase of life behind for another. With the moon’s reflection of the sun obscured by shadow, unsettling emotions and memories may be unearthed from buried places. The watery nature of the eclipse will be accentuated by Mars, Saturn and Neptune, also occupying water signs. Emotional purging may be necessary as feelings from the past surface to be released and washed away. As this eclipse opposes Uranus, some of the dredged-up material could lead to valuable insight and creative breakthroughs, while in other cases there could be sudden plot twists to negotiate. Some of us may need extra time for rest and recovery, while others may need to engage in vigorous activity to move the energy, but if possible avoid taking on too much in the days surrounding the eclipse.\n\nMercury, currently retrograde, will continue to slowly move backwards in the week following the eclipse, before ultimately stationing direct on 15 May. Make intentional effort to be mindful in the days surrounding Mercury’s stationing, as Mercury’s return to visibility in the sky before dawn will correspond with meaningful messages coming into awareness. The second half of May hosts astrological transits that can activate significant developments and new opportunities; utilising the final period of Mercury retrograde for adjusting routines and personal structures will help prepare for an influx of growth. Mercury will station direct while forming harmonious sextile aspects with Venus in Cancer and Saturn in Pisces, initiating a period of forward momentum that will support dynamic creativity combined with focused, practical application.\n\nThe most significant astrological event of the month occurs the day after Mercury stations direct, when Jupiter enters Taurus on 16 May. Jupiter has previously moved quickly through Aries after entering the sign on 20 December last year, following an additional stint from 11 May to 28 October 2022. While Jupiter in Aries supported accelerated growth and courageous risk-taking, Jupiter’s pace will slow considerably in the fertile, earthy terrain of Taurus. Jupiter in Taurus patiently tends to long-term goals that will foster increased stability and security over time. Jupiter in Taurus loves being surrounded by beauty and favours the tangible and sensual over ungrounded ideas. It’s an ideal time to begin constructing a garden to contain and nurture the fruits and flowers of your imagination.\n\nFollowing the ingress of Jupiter into Taurus, the dark soil of the Taurus new moon on 19 May will be fertile and ready for the planting of visionary seeds. Consider what you wish to create over the next year, as Jupiter continues to cultivate the earth of Taurus until eventually exiting the sign of the bull on 26 May 2024. The stillness of the new moon in Taurus will be disrupted the following day. Mars enters Leo on 20 May, inciting tension with Jupiter and Pluto, opposing Pluto in Aquarius on 21 May and forming a catalysing square aspect with Jupiter in Taurus on 23 May. There will likely be loud and thundering current events striking like lightning around the world as we traverse one of the most significant collective thresholds of the year. The potency of Jupiter, Mars and Pluto combined will stoke the flames of grand ambitions while also making us encounter internal and external blocks. Lean into the patience of Jupiter in Taurus while facing whatever trouble arises.\n\nIn the wake of the explosiveness of Mars, Jupiter and Pluto clashing together, the period of the moon waxing toward fullness on 4 June will be ideal for making steady progress on goals and visions. The moon’s brief passage through Scorpio on 1–2 June may bring up difficult feelings and emotions that will need to be released, but otherwise this will be a sweet spot of the year. Take advantage of this moment for integrating any significant lessons gained from the earlier period of eclipses and Mercury retrograde.\n\nNotes from the Ignota Diary\n\nIn nature\n\nThis month Hawthorn (crataegus monogyna) is in full bloom. The flowers on these bushes are a hallmark of May, and their thorny branches feature in May Day traditions all over the UK. Leaves, flowers and fruits are useful in herbal remedies, particularly regarding the blood and the heart. Culpeper noted that hawthorn is ruled by Mars, and that ‘the thorn gives a medicine for its own pricking.’\n\nThe first half of may is also a great time to forage bramble or blackberry leaves (rubus fruticosus) before or during flowering and lay to dry. Ruled by Venus and Scorpio, the leaves are attributed to the element of water. Although they have cooling properties they are said to be a mild aphrodisiac. Apply bruised leaves to burns, haemorrhoids and eczema. Or use with a black candle and black salt for protection and returning evil.\n\nOn 6–7 May the Eta Aquarids are visible, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. The meteors are produced by dust from comet Halley, which has been observed at 75-year intervals since ancient times, including in 1066, when its passage was believed to have heralded the Norman conquest of England. The Aquarids are visible annually – this year, the bright light of the waning gibbous moon may obscure all but the brightest.\n\nSignificant dates\n\n5 May 2004 is the anniversary of the date the Supreme Court of India upheld the decision to allow universities to offer advanced degrees in Vedic astrology, thus retaining its place as one of the sciences.\n\n7 May 1940 is the birthday of Angela Carter, novelist, short story writer and journalist. Carter’s surreal stories, steeped in esotericism and fantasy, explore myth and gender. ‘The invisible is only another unexplored country, a brave new world.’\n\nOn 18 May 1048 Omar Khayyam, Persian mathematician, astronomer and poet, was born in Nishapur, a major centre of the Zoroastrian religion. The poetry ascribed to him became hugely popular in English translation as The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam during the fin de siècle. ‘Heaven and hell are inside.’\n\nCelebrations and festivals\n\n8-9 May is Lag BaOmer, a Jewish holy day taking place on the 18th of the month of Iyar. Celebrates the passing of the second century CE Rabbi Shimon barYochai, the first to publicly teach the mystical dimension of the Torah known as the Kabbalah, and author of the Zohar. Celebrate with bonfires, parades, and family outings, on which children traditionally play with bows and arrows.\n\n8 or 13 May: Feast of Julian of Norwich, mystic and anchorite. On the brink of death she receives a series of visions of Christ and the Virgin Mary, revealing God’s love for humanity through the figure of Jesus, that miraculously cure her. She will write these ‘shewings’ in Revelations of Divine Love, the earliest surviving book in English written by a woman, and dedicate her life to solitary prayer. She is also patron saint of ladies with cats.\n\n18 May is Semik, an ancient Slavic fertility festival linked to a cult of the dead. On this day the rusalki spirits leave their watery abodes to swing from birch branches. No swimming, instead they use magic circles, garlic and wormwood for warding. Funeral rites are performed for those who have not received them.\n\nOn 20 May, Gawai Dayak is celebrated in Malaysia and Indonesia. Among the Dayak, longhouses are cleaned and decorated, and vegetables gathered from the gardens and the surrounding jungle to banish the spirits of greed. Offerings to the gods are placed in room corners, always in odd numbers: cigarettes, rice cakes, glutinous rice. Later on, the sword dance and the singing of poems continue the thanksgivings.\n\n25–27 May 2023: Shavuot, the ‘Feast of Weeks’. This Jewish holiday occurs on the sixth day of the Hebrew month of Sivan, concluding the seven-week Counting of the Omer that begins on the second day of Passover. In Orthodox rabbinic traditions, the date marks the revelation of the Torah to Moses at Mount Sinai on this date in 1314 BCE.\n\nOn 26 May 2023 is the Birthday of the Buddha, celebrated in many East Asian countries Buddha’s Birth is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The day is an official holiday in Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea. Japan celebrates on 8 April of the Gregorian calendar each year.\n\nTai Shani: Full Moon Residency\n\nImage: Tai Shani, NHA 10, 2022. From NH: Beneath The Commune. Courtesy the artist. Photography by Theo Christelis.\n\nFive and Nine: May Tarotscope\n\nImage: AX Mina.\n\nMonthly tarotscopes are produced in partnership with Five and Nine, a podcast and newsletter at the crossroads of magic, work and economic justice.\n\nThis tarotscope is a general reading for the collective, using a combination of the I Ching and tarot, in which we present tarot cards for the different elements. Read for the elements calling to you now, whether that’s associated with your Sun, rising or Moon sign, or one speaking to you at this time in your life.\n\nWe consulted the I Ching using three coins, interpreting them with Benebell Wen’s private translations and annotations. The tarot was read using the Buddha Tarot by Lo Robert M. Place, and using the seed-root-garden spread developed by Five and Nine. Card titles are presented as is, with equivalents in parentheses.\n\nThese readings were channeled amidst chanting Om Shanti Shanti, extending a prayer of peace, for all readers of this tarotscope, in this fifth month of the Chariot Year and third month of the Rabbit Year.\n\nI Ching Reading\n\n䷠ 33 Retreat (遯 dùn)\n\nIn I Ching readings, there are often two hexagrams, representing the situation and the evolution of the situation. Because we are using a deck rather than coins this month, the changes between hexagrams is stronger than usual. Each hexagram contains two forces, represented by trigrams, one above and one below.\n\nIn this reading, however, there was no change of the hexagrams. This can suggest a time of stillness, and it’s especially resonant given the theme of Retreat (䷠), which is composed of Heaven (☰) above and Mountain (☶) below. The mountain points upward into heaven, which gives a hint as to the nature of the retreat recommended.\n\nRest well and take a minute to assess your situation. During this eclipse, it’s wise to pause and get a bird’s eye view on the conditions you face. This retreat is not one of escape but regeneration. You’ll know when it’s time to return to the matters of the earth soon enough\n\nTarot Reading\n\nGarden: 7 of Lotuses (7 of Wands)\n\nRoot: 6 of Lotuses (6 of Wands)\n\nSeed: 5 of Lotuses (5 of Wands)\n\nNo mud, no lotus, as Thich Nhat Hanh has said. In the Buddha Tarot, the wands suit – the suit of qi, or energy, or life force – is represented through the lotus, a symbol of beauty and grace emerging from the ugliness from which it grows.\n\nWhat’s planted right now is a coming together, a collaboration, a place of welcoming and invitation. Taking root is a celebration of the work you’ve done to get here. Can you make space to find the joy in this moment, despite or even because of any hardships? To allow this root to grow, take time to grapple with the doubt within. On the other side is the path to wisdom.\n\nIn reality, as the lotus teaches us, beautiful and ugly are the same, if we make space to recognise the potential in each. No lotus, no mud.\n\nFire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)\n\n4 of Vajras (4 of Swords)\n\nMake time for repose and calm in the midst of this great battle. Your fire energy wants to compel you forward, but it may be coming at a cost right now. Consider what it looks like to meditate quietly with the new buds in your life and ground yourself in the moment. The action will come soon enough.\n\nEarth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)\n\nRatnadakini – Dakini of Jewels (Page of Pentacles)\n\nRatna Dakini, the sky-dweller of golden yellow, dances surrounded by the flames of wisdom. Your earthly nature may ask you to be still, but this moment calls for energising. Somatic work can help: try dancing, shaking, and rapid movement. The new jewels in your life are worth paying attention to and celebrating. It’s okay to let the heart sing.\n\nAir (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)\n\n9 of Jewels (9 of Pentacles)\n\nWhen was the last time you paused to allow yourself to celebrate everything you’ve accomplished so far? There are great jewels all around you. You may want to consider their merits further, but before you do, make space to celebrate. You deserve to look back on your achievements so far and allow a little pride and joy to wash through.\n\nWater (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)\n\nAce of Jewels (Ace of Pentacles)\n\nThe flame is burning bright with a new opportunity ahead. This moments call you to cultivate a drive and direction that may feel uncomfortable at first but may reward you soon enough. Be cautious but not afraid – with careful nurturing, the fire will propel you forward rather than consume you.\n\nMarcos Lutyens: Contributor-at-Large\n\nIgnota welcomes our thirteenth Contributor-at-large, artist Marcos Lutyens.

This interview explores how Lutyens arrived at the concurrent worlds of art, plant medicine and hypnosis. The interview has been edited for clarity and concision.\n\nImage: Marcos Lutyens. Courtesy Galerie Alberta Pane.\n\nSusanna Davies-Crook: I’d love to explore the parallel between your drawings and your relationship to plants and journeying with plant medicine, and then also to journeying in the hypnotic realms. Could you begin by telling us about the induction you’ve created for members of The Mountain?\n\nMarcos Lutyens: This hypnosis induction is derived from some sketches that I did in the Peruvian rainforest, and is based around plant visions. I amalgamated some of the visions I and some of my fellow travellers experienced while we were there. I have a beautiful sketchbook that I enjoy looking at, with these kind of portraits of the journeys that I went on – the visions that I saw with my friends. I selected three for this induction and amalgamated them together to make a combined journey, which in a way helps the listener experience some of these plant induced journeys.\n\nSDC: And how does that work, in terms of making the visions into words?\n\nML: I suppose, originally, the visions that are experienced are kind of beyond words; they’re very visual. Sometimes they include sounds – the words one experiences in these visions are more related to sound than to the meaning of word. That’s also something that I use an element of: in an induction I say ‘as you listen to the sound of my voice’, because the sound is equally as important as the word.\n\nSDC: How did you start working with plants?\n\nML: I started when I was seventeen. I was in South America and my first experience was with mushrooms, though those aren’t strictly speaking plants. Then I had my first experience with the vine; I encountered a shaman who showed me how to prepare the medicine and cut the leaves from from the respective plants. So I wandered off, and about three weeks later I bought a large cauldron and lit a little fire on a hillside in Ecuador. I started to cook the medicine down until there was just a paste – it took probably about eight hours – then I went back to my residence and I sat on my bed, and I took the medicine. About fifteen minutes after I took it, I thought that my feet were getting colder and colder. I’d just read Plato’s Last Days of Socrates, where he takes the hemlock and the same kind of cold feeling happened to Socrates, so I thought I was actually going to die. Some people, when they go on these medicine retreats, they're very well-accompanied. My first experience was just diving in at the deep end. Anyway, I didn’t die, which was nice, and I had some incredible experiences. That was certainly a kind of initiation I will never forget. I witnessed a kind of amorphous God in the sky. Then, in a bookstore probably two or three years later, I discovered the supposed meaning of the word ‘Ayahuasca’: the place of the dead or the spirits of the dead. So that kind of made sense, to see God and to have this experience of dying. Then I didn’t really have too many experiences with plant medicine until I was twenty-six, when I was invited to do set design for a film in Mexico. In the mountains where we were shooting, there was a tribe whose cosmologies revolve around Peyote, and so I became very interested in learning about their cosmology and seeing the universe and also experiencing the plant medicine. I had some initiations with shamans up in the mountains, and some incredible learning experiences directly from the plant medicine. I was tempted to just stay there, learning from this tribe; they were very welcoming and generous in sharing their knowledge. But I felt the call after a while to go back to ‘the Western world’.\n\nAfter the experience in Mexico I went to live in Los Angeles. There, I wanted to practice some of this learning. Obviously, plant medicine is difficult to come by and kind of illegal, so I came into contact with hypnosis, almost by chance. I was invited design a set with an artist called Ron Athey for his performance. He and his troop were doing very challenging exercises that were quite painful… people were strung up on hooks, not as a masochistic exercise, but as a shamanic exercise. In those rehearsals, there was a hypnotist and professor of Philosophy at the University of Irvine who was practising hypnosis in order to reduce the pain of the performers when they were being strung up on hooks. I was just very impressed by how he could train the dancers to overcome the sense of pain and get through the performance. After that, I submitted myself to David McLennan as basically a guinea pig to move through experiences of pain and catalepsy. I also had him implant an idea – because I always felt that I'm some kind of an exile – I asked him to implant the idea that home was inside me, so that I always felt at home.\n\nI have a friend who was working on sound design with David Lynch at the time. I began to work with him to see how the sound of my voice amplified through through sound design as well. So that was basically my journey from plant medicine into hypnosis, then back into plant medicine.\n\nSDC: Last time we chatted, we spoke a bit about spiritual bypassing. It’s interesting to hear you talk about being seventeen and working with the plant in this very deep and material way. I think in contemporary culture, we’re now becoming quite used to people going to Ayahuasca ceremonies in someone’s basement in the suburbs, or ordering it off of the internet. It has become this quite removed process, almost fast-forwarding to the end goal, in a way that really is removed from the earth and from actually working with the plant. So it's really nice to hear you talk about your journey with the material, and with the energy of the plant itself and its growth. I wonder how you feel about this and what you think the shift is, because obviously you began earlier, and there’s since been a big development in the adoption and perhaps co-option of certain plant medicine practices in the West.\n\nML: I suppose there’s definitely more structure. I’m thinking of perhaps something a journey to the Grand Canyon fifty years ago, where there would have been mostly no ropes – no signs. But you still feel the compulsion of going down to the bottom of the canyon to the Colorado River. And now when you go there, there are restaurants and there’s parking, people getting back into control. I suppose the experience is quite different.\n\nSDC: Do you feel that something is lost in that people aren’t actually involved with the plant itself? They’re not speaking to the plant as it grows, they’re not harvesting the vine. They’re just receiving this ground-up stuff that they don't have a connection with. So a whole section of that journey is removed. Although perhaps visions come, they’re not shared with the actual energy of the plant in it’s essence?\n\nML: You know, US society or civilisation has turned people more and more into consumers – as opposed to prosumers or people who generate a more direct experience with themselves – so I suppose it would become more passive, in that sense. The other aspect of feeling the energy of the plants in a more direct way, and also the setting, relates to my work with synesthesia. If you arrive at the ceremony in a state of being where your activity, your sense of smell, connection to the plants, the surroundings, the trees, the animals is heightened - you're more likely to have an enlightening journey with the medicine. Within an antiseptic environment, you know, everything kind of ‘civilized’, that’s terribly sad… the more you get your hands dirty and feel the plants and all that organic material, including the decay and the composting, the more you’re gonna connect together.\n\nSDC: Regarding your process, what is the connection between vision and drawing? I think there’s a translation happening: between your journey, the images and visions, the transferral of that onto paper and then also through your practice of hypnosis into language. And so there’s this almost indescribable journey, which is a felt journey. Hypnosis is somatic, so as you’re journeying in your mind, you’re also journeying in your body, even though you’re physically still. I think that’s also one of the things for me that’s the most transformative and the most healing when I work with people, because it’s the thing they don’t realise: that working through trauma and things like that can be done in this way. When you are journeying, your body is releasing as you’re moving through the worlds.\n\nML: I was just rewinding in my mind how the process works. During the vision, it’s almost almost like a photocopy machine or some kind of dark room developing process. With certain conditions the image may be stronger and more persistent, and have made a stronger imprint on the consciousness. Those stronger imprints resonate and stay longer, for the duration of the ceremony. Towards the end of the ceremony, they are still there. What I had was a small notepad and with my eyes closed (or open but it's usually too dark to see what's going on) I scribbled some notes, imagery, symbols – whatever came out of my hand. I would hope that when somebody sees that drawing the haptic conscious – or unconscious – will somehow translate to the viewer.\n\nImage: Marcos Lutyens.

At this time of year, the flowers of this magic plant are practically everywhere. Often called ‘fairy clocks’ because their flowers open and close predictably, following the sunrise and the sunset. Dandelion can symbolise love, wishes, welcome, faithfulness and divination, as well as grief and bitterness. In astrology, dandelion is governed by Jupiter and the Sun, while in Ayurvedic medicine it is associated with Saturn.\n\nLemon balm (Melissa officinalis), a member of the mint family, is considered a calming herb. It has been used since the Middle Ages to reduce stress and anxiety, promote sleep, improve appetite, and ease pain and discomfort from indigestion.\n\nKombucha (makes 3 litres)\n\nKukicha tea, 10g\n\nDried lemon balm, 20g\n\nSpring water, 2.5 litres\n\nUnrefined cane sugar, 300g\n\nUnpasteurised kombucha (or the liquid that comes with a packed scoby) 500ml\n\n1 scoby\n\nHoney fermented dandelion flowers\n\nFresh dandelion flowers, 200g\n\nSpring water, 500ml\n\nHoney, 280g\n\nHow to prepare the kombucha\n\n3L jar, open on the top\n\nA cheesecloth\n\nAn elastic band\n\nThe jar needs to be sterilised with hot water for a couple of minutes. Once cooled, fill with the scoby and the unpasteurised kombucha, cover the top with the cheesecloth, and tighten well with the elastic band.\n\nHave two pans ready, one in which you will keep the Kukicha tea and lemon balm ready for the brew and a second in which to bring 300ml of water to a gentle simmer together with 300g of sugar.\n\nOnce ready, pour the simmering syrup on the tea mix and cover with a lid, leaving it brewing for 12 minutes.\n\nAt the end of the brewing process filter the tea through a fine filter bag and add 2.2l of water, bringing the temperature down to around 30ºC.\n\nPour everything into the jar with the scoby and the unpasteurised kombucha.\n\nMake sure there is an inch gap at the top of the jar, and cover again tightly with the cheesecloth.\n\nThe kombucha will take something between 7 to 10 days to ferment, depending on storage temperature. A perfect brew requires a constant temperature between 26–29ºC but anything less will just take longer. The important thing is to keep it away from the sun and bright light.\n\nI usually try"
