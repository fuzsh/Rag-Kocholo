        "text": "Hana Pestle has had a taste of her own music and isn't looking back. The acoustic alternative rocker recently recorded her album in L.A. and is planning to label shop the recording after graduating high school this spring.\n\n\"Every single song is completely different,\" Pestle said of the recording. \"I'm really happy with how it all turned out. I don't know how to describe it. It's really cool.\"\n\nHer Myspace page showcases four songs, recorded more than a year ago. The new recordings are quite different, according to Pestle.\n\n\"It's just more -- I don't even know -- It's more quality. It's a little darker on all the songs and more rock.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nThe album took ten months to record and Pestle spent two days in L.A. recording a handful of songs with strings, arranged by David Campbell (who has produced music for Alanis Morissette, Phil Collins, Michael Jackson, Elton John, to name a few, as well as being the biological father of the musical genius Beck). Ben Moody, co-founder of Evanescence, and Michael \"Fish\" Herring, who has worked with Prince, Christina Aguilera, and Tupac, produced the album.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus from live performance, Pestle is scheduled to make several live appearances, including acoustic performances Saturday and Sunday at the Ultimate Music and Art Festival.\n\nFor her, performing live seems a bit strange after recording her album. \"It's just me,\" she said of performing acoustically. \"But now I know how each song is going to sound fully produced.\"\n\nCatch Pestle at this weekend's festival on the main stage from 2:40 - 3:20 p.m. Saturday and on the Philosopher's Café Stage from 3:30 pm - 4:30 p.m. Sunday. The festival is FREE and takes place at Ultimate Space, located on the corner of Mullowney Lane and Titan Avenue.\n\nFor a full list of performers and times, visit Ultimate Space's website.\n\nShe is also opening for Jerod Birchell at during a No Dough Show Thursday at the Club Carlin as well as performing April 25 at the Yellowstone Valley Brewery Co.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
