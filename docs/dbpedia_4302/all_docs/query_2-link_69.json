        "text": "Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Induced Dyspepsia.\n\nPubMed\n\nYap, Paul Ray-Yee; Goh, Khean-Lee\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most prescribed group of drugs in the world. They are used primarily for pain relief in chronic inflammatory joint disease and act by inhibiting enzymes COX1 and COX2 and ultimately preventing the production of active prostanoids which are required for the innate inflammatory pathway. The use of NSAIDs have been associated with the development of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms ranging from simple dyspepsia to life threatening GI bleeds and perforations. The definition of dyspepsia has evolved over the years and this has hampered accurate studies on the prevalence of dyspepsia as different studies used varying criteria to define dyspepsia. It is now known that NSAIDs significantly increase the risk of dyspepsia.The risk of developing peptic ulcer disease vary with specific NSAIDs and dosages but there is no correlation between the symptoms of dyspepsia and underlying peptic ulcers. The pathogenesis of dyspepsia with NSAIDs is not completely understood. Peptic ulceration alone is not able to account for the majority of dyspepsia symptoms encountered by NSAIDs users. Erosive oesophagitis secondary to NSAIDs may be contributing factor to the prevalence of dyspepsia in NSAIDs users. Altered gut permeability and changes in gastric mechanosensory function due to NSAIDs may also be a contributory factor. Management of NSAID induced dyspepsia is involves a multipronged approach. Drug avoidance if possible would be ideal. Other options include using the lowest effective dose, changing to an NSAIDs with a safer GI risk profile, avoiding concurrent use with other NSAIDs or if the patient has a previous history of peptic ulcer disease, and co-prescribing with anti-secretory medications such as proton pump inhibitors. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori has a protective role against developing peptic ulcers and may also improve symptoms of NSAIDs induced dyspepsia.\n\nIs non-steroidal anti-inflammaory drug (NSAID) enteropathy clinically more important than NSAID gastropathy?\n\nPubMed\n\nAdebayo, D; Bjarnason, I\n\n2006-03-01\n\nThe side effects of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the stomach is undoubtedly a serious public health problem contributing significantly to the morbidity and mortality of patients receiving these drugs. However, the damage of NSAIDs is not confined to the stomach. Indeed the short term and long term damage of NSAIDs on the small bowel (NSAID enteropathy) is more frequent than NSAID gastropathy. Furthermore, NSAID enteropathy is associated with complications (bleeding and protein loss). While many of these are mild, the serious events (significant bleeding, perforation, obstruction, and sudden death) are frequent as that reported for NSAID gastropathy. The diagnosis of NSAID enteropathy has been greatly aided by the introduction of wireless capsule enteroscopy.\n\n[U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strengthens warning that non-aspirin non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause myocardial infarctions or strokes: the dentist's perspective].\n\nPubMed\n\nRosen, E; Tsesis, I; Vered, M\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis short communication is aimed to update dental practitioners regarding the recently published warning of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the risk for severe cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke following the use of non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\nRescue strategies against non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nLim, Yun Jeong; Lee, Jeong Sang; Ku, Yang Suh; Hahm, Ki-Baik\n\n2009-07-01\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide, which attests to their efficacy as analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents as well as anticancer drugs. However, NSAID use also carries a risk of major gastroduodenal events, including symptomatic ulcers and their serious complications that can lead to fatal outcomes. The development of \"coxibs\" (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitors) offered similar efficacy with reduced toxicity, but this promise of gastroduodenal safety has only partially been fulfilled, and is now dented with associated risks of cardiovascular or intestinal complications. Recent advances in basic science and biotechnology have given insights into molecular mechanisms of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal damage beyond COX-2 inhibition. The emergence of newer kinds of NSAIDs should alleviate gastroduodenal toxicity without compromising innate drug efficacy. In this review, novel strategies for avoiding NSAID-associated gastroduodenal damage will be described.\n\nPharmacology and potential therapeutic applications of nitric oxide-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and related nitric oxide-donating drugs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKeeble, J E; Moore, P K\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis review examines the biological significance, therapeutic potential and mechanism(s) of action of a range of nitric oxide-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NO-NSAID) and related nitric oxide-releasing donating drugs (NODD). The slow release of nitric oxide (NO) from these compounds leads to subtle changes in the profile of pharmacological activity of the parent, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). For example, compared with NSAID, NO-NSAID cause markedly diminished gastrointestinal toxicity and improved anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive efficacy. In addition, nitroparacetamol exhibits hepatoprotection as opposed to the hepatotoxic activity of paracetamol. The possibility that NO-NSAID or NODD may be of therapeutic benefit in a wide variety of disease states including pain and inflammation, thrombosis and restenosis, neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, colitis, cancer, urinary incontinence, liver disease, impotence, bronchial asthma and osteoporosis is discussed.

The drugs are effective and can be relatively inexpensive thanks to available generic versions. Unfortunately the traditional NSAIDs are associated with gastrointestinal complications in a small proportion of patients, requiring costly co-therapy with gastro-protective agents. Recently, a new class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents known as coxibs has become available, fashioned to be safer than the traditional NSAIDs but priced considerably higher than the traditional generics. To help physicians choose appropriately and cost-effectively from the expanded number of anti-inflammatory therapies, scientific bodies have issued clinical practice guidelines and third party payers have published restricted reimbursement policies. The objective of this study is to determine whether an educational intervention can prompt physicians to adjust their prescribing in accordance with these expert recommendations. Methods This is an ongoing, randomized controlled trial. All primary care physicians in Manitoba, Canada have been randomly assigned to a control group or an intervention study group. The educational intervention being evaluated consists of an audit and feedback mechanism combined with optional participation in a Continuing Medical Education interactive workshop. The primary outcome of the study is the change, from pre-to post-intervention, in physicians' appropriate prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapies for patients requiring chronic treatment. Three classes of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapies have been identified: coxib therapy, traditional NSAID monotherapy, and traditional NSAID therapy combined with gastro-protective agents. Appropriate prescribing is defined based on international clinical practice guidelines and the provincial drug reimbursement policy in Manitoba.

All the NSAID derivatives highly decreased lipidemic indices in the plasma of Triton treated hyperlipidemic rats. The most potent compound was the indomethacin derivative, which decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol by 73%, 80% and 83%, respectively. They reduced acute inflammation equally or more than most parent acids. Hence, it could be concluded that amides of common NSAIDs with thiomorpholine acquire considerable hypolipidemic potency, while they preserve or augment their anti-inflammatory activity, thus addressing significant risk factors for atherogenesis.

Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been shown to preferentially inhibit activity of the COX-2 enzyme, which maintains anti-inflammatory activity but reduces GI toxicity. To determine the degree of switching from non-selective NSAIDs to COX-2 inhibitors and to examine the factors that were associated with switching. The General Medical Services prescription database (1.2 million people) was examined for NSAID prescriptions from December 1999 through November 2001. All those receiving non-selective NSAIDs and those switching to selective COX-2 inhibitors after at least 1 month on a non-selective NSAID were identified (non-switchers and switchers, respectively). Age, sex, dose of non-selective NSAID and co-prescribing of anti-peptic ulcer (anti-PU) drugs were considered between switchers and non-switchers, and odds ratios (OR) calculated using logistic regression. The effect of chronic use (> or =3 months prescription of a non-selective NSAID during the study period) on switching was also evaluated. A total of 81,538 of 480,573 patients (17%) initially prescribed non-selective NSAIDs were switched to COX-2 inhibitors during the study. The elderly (65 years or older) were more likely to be switched to a COX-2 inhibitor [OR=1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79, 1.84]. Women were also more likely to be switched to COX-2 inhibitor therapy (OR=1.25, 95% CI 1.23, 1.27). Previous but not subsequent prescribing of anti-PU drugs was also associated with switching. Chronic users showed similar switching patterns. Prescribers are more likely to switch older female patients and those with a past history of peptic ulcers from non-selective NSAIDs to COX-2 inhibitors. This suggests that doctors take risk factors into consideration when prescribing NSAIDs. The relatively low rate of switching may\n\nInhibition of amyloidogenesis by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their hybrid nitrates\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchiefer, Isaac T.; Abdul-Hay, Samer; Wang, Huali; Vanni, Michael; Qin, Zhihui; Thatcher, Gregory R. J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPoor blood-brain barrier penetration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been blamed for the failure of the selective amyloid lowering agent (SALA) R-flurbiprofen in phase 3 clinical trials for Alzheimerâs disease (AD). NO-donor NSAIDs (NO-NSAIDs) provide an alternative, gastric-sparing approach to NSAID SALAs, which may improve bioavailability. NSAID analogs were studied for anti-inflammatory activity and for SALA activity in N2a neuronal cells transfected with human amyloid precursor protein (APP). Flurbiprofen (1) analogs were obtained with enhanced anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic properties compared to 1, however, esterification led to elevated AÎ²1â42 levels. Hybrid nitrate prodrugs possessed superior anti-inflammatory activity and reduced toxicity relative to the parent NSAIDs, including clinical candidate, CHF5074. Although hybrid nitrates elevated AÎ²1â42 at higher concentration, SALA activity was observed at low concentrations (â¤ 1 ÂµM): both AÎ²1â42 and the ratio of AÎ²1â42/AÎ²1â40 were lowered. This biphasic SALA activity was attributed to the intact nitrate drug. For several compounds the selective modulation of amyloidogenesis was tested using an immunoprecipitation MALDI-TOF approach. These data support the development of NO-NSAIDs as an alternative approach towards a clinically useful SALA.

NSAID enteropathy is common and is mostly asymptomatic. However, massive bleeding, stricture, or perforation may occur. The pathogenesis of small intestine injury by NSAIDs is complex and different from that of the upper gastrointestinal tract. No drug has yet been developed that can completely prevent or treat NSAID enteropathy. Therefore, a long-term randomized study in chronic NSAID users is needed.

It is a highly effective drug class for pain and inflammation; however, NSAIDs are known for multiple adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular side effects, and NSAID induced nephrotoxicity. As our society ages, it is crucial to have comprehensive knowledge of this class of medication in the elderly population. Therefore, we reviewed the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, current guidelines for NSAIDs use, adverse effect profile, and drug interaction of NSAIDs and commonly used medications in the elderly.

An improved method for the determination of authorized and non-authorized residues of 10 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in milk was developed. Analytes were separated and acquired by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometer (ESI-MS/MS). Target compounds were acidified in plasma, and plasma and milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile and both extracts were purified on an improved solid phase extraction procedure utilising Evolute ABN cartridges. The accuracy of the methods for milk and plasma was between 73 and 109%. The precision of the method for authorized and non-authorized NSAIDs in milk and plasma expressed as % RSD, for the within lab reproducibility was less than 16%. The % RSD for authorized NSAIDs at their associated MRL(s) in milk was less than 10% for meloxicam, flunixin and tolfenamic acid and was less than 25% for hydroxy flunixin. The methods were validated according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC.\n\nLung abscess complicating pneumococcal pneumonia: a causal role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs?\n\nPubMed\n\nGibelin, Aude; de Prost, Nicolas; Brun-Buisson, Christian\n\n2013-08-20\n\nPulmonary abscess is a distinctly uncommon complication of pneumococcal pneumonia in immunocompetent adults that has recently been reported to occur following administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

However, the mechanism by which anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) might slow the progression of AD is not completely known. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between NSAIDs use and AD in a large sample of community-dwelling elderly people. In a cross-sectional retrospective study, the authors analyzed data on patients admitted to home care programs. A total of 12 home health agencies participated in the project, with a total of 2,708 patients enrolled in the present study. The main outcome measures were the prevalence of AD and use of NSAIDs treatment. Compared with all non-users, NSAID users had a nearly 50% lower risk of being affected by AD. Separate multivariate analyses of subjects receiving different types of NSAIDs found a significantly decreased risk of cognitive impairment associated with non-aspirin NSAID use, whereas, among subjects taking aspirin, the difference in estimated risk did not reach statistical significance. The results of this population-based cross-sectional study are consistent with the notion that long-term NSAIDs use has a protective effect against AD. However, after possible confounding effects of age and several other variables potentially associated with cognitive impairment were controlled, this association was statistically significant only for non-aspirin NSAIDs use.\n\nA binding site for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in FAAH\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBertolacci, Laura; Romeo, Elisa; Veronesi, Marina; Magotti, Paola; Albani, Clara; Dionisi, Mauro; Lambruschini, Chiara; Scarpelli, Rita; Cavalli, Andrea; Vivo, Marco De; Piomelli, Daniele; Garau, Gianpiero\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn addition to inhibiting the cyclooxygenasemediated biosynthesis of prostanoids, various widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) enhance endocannabinoid signaling by blocking the anandamidedegrading membrane enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).

Two patterns consisting of continuation of an NSAID plus administration of the prostaglandin (PG) preparation misoprostol (PG model) for 8 weeks and continuation of an NSAID plus administration of the proton-pump inhibitors omeprazole and lansoprazole (PPI model) for 8 weeks were examined. Decision analysis models were created on the basis of reports of clinical studies and epidemiologic studies relating to the drugs and gastric ulcer, and cost-comparative analyses were conducted based on the number of persons who had ulcer healing as health outcomes. Costs were estimated with respect to health expenditures from the third-party payer (public) perspective. In the case of continuation of an NSAID plus administration of the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole for 8 weeks, the health outcomes improved and costs were reduced in comparison with continuation of an NSAID plus administration of misoprostol, thus making the administration of omeprazole the dominant choice. With continuation of an NSAID plus administration of lansoprazole for 8 weeks, the cost-savings of lansoprazole were inferior to those of misoprostol. The generic omeprazole product was the most cost-saving among the four drugs (misoprostol, original omeprazole product, generic omeprazole product, and lansoprazole) examined.\n\nBiophysical study of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac with phosphatidylserine bilayer membranes.\n\nPubMed\n\nManrique-Moreno, Marcela; Heinbockel, Lena; Suwalsky, Mario; Garidel, Patrick; Brandenburg, Klaus\n\n2016-09-01\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent an effective pain treatment option and therefore one of the most sold therapeutic agents worldwide. The study of the molecular interactions responsible for their physiological activity, but also for their side effects, is therefore important. This report presents data on the interaction of the most consumed NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac) with one main phospholipid in eukaryotic cells, dimyristoylphosphatidylserine (DMPS). The applied techniques are Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), with which in transmission the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of the acyl chains in the absence and presence of the NSAID are monitored, supplemented by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data on the phase transition. FTIR in reflection (ATR, attenuated total reflectance) is applied to record the dependence of the interactions of the NSAID with particular functional groups observed in the DMPS spectrum such as the ester carbonyl and phosphate vibrational bands. With FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) a possible intercalation of the NSAID into the DMPS liposomes and with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) the thermodynamics of the interaction are monitored. The data show that the NSAID react in a particular way with this lipid, but in some parameters the three NSAID clearly differ, with which now a clear picture of the interaction processes is possible.

Thus pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory processes may be effective antiaging strategy. In this study we demonstrated that treatment of Drosophila melanogaster with 10 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs: CAY10404, aspirin, APHS, SC-560, NS-398, SC-58125, valeroyl salicylate, trans-resveratrol, valdecoxib, licofelone) leads to extension of lifespan, delays age-dependent decline of locomotor activity and increases stress resistance. The effect of the lifespan increase was associated with decrease of fecundity. Depending on the concentration, NSAIDs demonstrated both anti- and pro-oxidant properties in Drosophila tissues. However, we failed to identify clear correlation between antioxidant properties of NSAIDs and their pro-longevity effects. The lifespan extending effects of APHS, SC-58125, valeroyl salicylate, trans-resveratrol, valdecoxib, and licofelone were more pronounced in males, valdecoxib and aspirin - in females. We demonstrated that lifespan extension effect of NSAIDs was abolished in flies with defective genes involved in Pkh2-ypk1-lem3-tat2 pathway.\n\nPersistency of use of COX-2-specific inhibitors and non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Quebec.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoride, Y; Ducruet, T; Rochon, S; Lavoie, F\n\n2003-11-01\n\nThe effectiveness of pharmacological therapies is dependent in part on patient persistency with the prescribed therapeutic regimen. In the case of non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), effectiveness is often compromised by undesirable side-effects, poor compliance or discontinuation of therapy. While patterns of utilization of non-specific NSAIDs have been investigated, few data are available on the patterns of persistency for cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors. This study used a provincial health-care system database in Quebec, Canada, to determine the duration of treatment in new users of COX-2-specific inhibitors and non-specific NSAIDs over the first 3 months of treatment, and to characterize the factors associated with treatment persistency. Results demonstrate that the median duration of treatment was longer among patients initially prescribed COX-2-specific inhibitors (30 days and 23 days for celecoxib and rofecoxib respectively) than in those prescribed non-selective NSAIDs (10 days). Although the percentage of patients remaining on COX-2-specific drugs declined over the course of treatment, few patients on either celecoxib or rofecoxib switched drugs, either to the other COX-2-specific inhibitor or to non-specific NSAIDs. Factors associated with persistent drug use were: COX-2-specific inhibitors, age, and the use of gastroprotective agents either at treatment initiation or during follow-up. Dosage, chronic disease score and prescriber's specialty were only marginally associated with persistency. Prior use of gastroprotective agents was associated with lower persistency. Although the limitations of this study, which included lack of information on the indication for the prescription and the reason for switch or discontinuation, preclude definite conclusions regarding patterns of use of these drugs, the data suggest that the use of COX-2-specific inhibitors may result in increased persistency with treatment.\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents.\n\nPubMed\n\nEccleston, Christopher; Cooper, Tess E; Fisher, Emma; Anderson, Brian; Wilkinson, Nick Mr\n\n2017-08-02\n\nPain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as important.We designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions.As the leading cause of morbidity in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (that is pain lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications (nociceptive, neuropathic, or idiopathic) from genetic conditions, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, as well as for other unknown reasons.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, reduce fever, and for their anti-inflammation properties. They are commonly used within paediatric pain management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently licensed for use in Western countries, however they are not approved for infants under three months old. The main adverse effects include renal impairment and gastrointestinal issues. Common side effects in children include diarrhoea, headache, nausea, constipation, rash, dizziness, and abdominal pain. To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of NSAIDs used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.

Also, NSAIDs pre-associated with phospholipid vesicles are shown to be safer and therapeutically more effective than unmodified ones. Our initial experiments and simulations on the partitioning of Aspirin and Ibuprofen clearly indicate role played by the drug structure in drug-membrane interactions. Those results motivated systematic molecular dynamics simulations of membranes with NSAIDs of different size, structure and pKa values. Our results suggest high partition coefficients for these NSAIDs in the membrane compared to water and thinning effect on the bilayer. Our small angle neutron scattering and reflectivity studies on DMPC-Ibuprofen systems indicate that the drug affects both Ë5 nm thick bilayer and overall Ë100 nm diameter vesicle, indicating that NSAIDs affect vesicles on various length scales. We will discuss the structural perturbations to membranes due to NSAIDs at clinically relevant molar ratios and their implications on the use of vesicles as delivery vehicles for NSAIDs.\n\nReversible ovulatory failure associated with the development of luteinized unruptured follicles in women with inflammatory arthritis taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, G; Roberts, R; Hall, C; Nuki, G\n\n1996-05-01\n\nThe case histories of three young women with ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis and a seronegative inflammatory polyarthritis undergoing investigations for infertility are presented. In each, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy was associated with the recurrent development of luteinized unruptured ovarian follicles and normal ovulation following drug withdrawal. It is suggested that NSAID therapy may be an important and frequently overlooked cause of anovulation and infertility.\n\nNatural remedies for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced toxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimon, Jerine Peter; Evan Prince, Sabina\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe liver is an important organ of the body, which has a vital role in metabolic functions. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac causes hepato-renal toxicity and gastric ulcers. NSAIDs are noted to be an agent for the toxicity of body organs. This review has elaborated various scientific perspectives of the toxicity caused by diclofenac and its mechanistic action in affecting the vital organ. This review suggests natural products are better remedies than current clinical drugs against the toxicity caused by NSAIDs.

However, it is impracticable to practise rigorous and unitary EPV process for all the existing and new pharmaceuticals. Here, we focused on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and discussed the necessity and potential opportunities of practising EPV of NSAIDs. We found that the consumption of NSAIDs is huge and ubiquitous across the globe. NSAIDs were worldwidely reported as one of the most dominant and frequently detected groups in environmental matrices including wastewater, surface water, suspended solids, sediments, groundwater, even drinking water. Besides, there is definitive evidence for the adverse impacts of NSAID residues on scavenging birds and aquatic species. These data suggested the necessity of implementing EPV of NSAIDs. From the perspective of drug administration, we identified some things that can be done as management practice options for EPV implementation on NSAIDs. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Current status and rational therapeutic use.\n\nPubMed\n\nHart, F D; Huskisson, E C\n\n1984-03-01\n\nAspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), the first of the NSAIDs (introduced in 1899), was initially never referred to as an anti-inflammatory agent. It was the advent of cortisone in 1949 that demonstrated dramatically that corticosteroids had anti-inflammatory properties and the term 'non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug' was first used when phenylbutazone was introduced 3 years later. Since then, the NSAIDs have proliferated. There is to date no good evidence that they halt progression of rheumatoid disease, but by easing pain and diminishing swelling they make life much easier in osteoarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and many other types of arthritis, and are the drugs of first choice in acute gout. Their mode (or modes) of action are obscure and though inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (prostaglandin synthetase) is clearly important, other mechanisms are also involved. The assessment of the anti-inflammatory action of these agents has received considerable attention in clinical trials because, whatever their action may be in experimental animal models, their action in inflamed joints in human patients must be ascertained, since there may be little parallel between the two. Different experimental animal models give different results with various agents and often bear little relation to their therapeutic action in man. No attempt has been made here to review in depth all the NSAIDs that have appeared since 1952. All have anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity and all can cause gastrointestinal side effects, though effectiveness and toxicity vary from drug to drug and patient to patient, there being very great interpatient variability. Non-reactors, patients who apparently fail to respond to certain agents, need further study, for it seems that these subjects may metabolise these agents differently from others. Considerable ingenuity has been shown not only in evolving new NSAIDs but in finding new ways of administering them.

Method: An existing survey instrument was modified and tested by five Ontario physiotherapists. The final version was distributed electronically to approximately 4,400 Ontario Physiotherapy Association members as a self-administered online questionnaire. Results: A total of 294 physiotherapists responded to the survey (response rate=6.7%). Respondents demonstrated variability in their knowledge of NSAID contraindications, side effects, and drug interactions. Most respondents (62.6%) were incorrect or unsure about where and how to obtain most NSAIDs, and most demonstrated incorrect or uncertain knowledge of the relevant legislation. Despite this lack of knowledge, 50% of respondents recommend NSAIDs to their patients. Conclusions: Many Ontario physiotherapists who participated in this survey recommend NSAIDs to their patients despite having a variable understanding of the legislation and medication-related factors. A lack of thorough knowledge of risks and contraindications has implications for patient safety. Physiotherapists who incorporate medications into their practice should access comprehensive information on appropriate NSAID use and should inform themselves about legislative restrictions to ensure that associated treatment is provided in a manner that is evidence based, safe, and in keeping with regulatory boundaries.

In Japan, national health insurance does not cover procedures that prevent or lower the risk for NSAIDs-induced ulcer. In NSAIDs treatment to patients with risk factors, it is desirable to administer antiulcer agents. However, in Japan, there are no large-scale studies on the efficacy of co-medication such as proton pump inhibitors, prostaglandin analogs (misoprostol) or histamine-H2 receptor antagonists or on the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication or selective COX-2 antagonists. In the future, large-scale clinical studies should be conducted to accumulate high quality evidence including cost-effectiveness and overall safety including cardiovascular events, because Japanese differ from Westerners in several genetical or acquired factors.\n\nRole of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Exacerbations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLong, Millie D.; Kappelman, Michael D.; Martin, Christopher F.; Chen, Wenli; Anton, Kristen; Sandler, Robert S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGOALS To determine the role of NSAIDs in activation of IBD. BACKGROUND Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may activate inflammatory pathways in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). STUDY Crohnâs and Colitis Foundation of American (CCFA) Partners is an ongoing cohort study of patients living with IBD. All data are self-reported via the internet. We identified a sub-cohort of participants whose disease activity, based on short Crohnâs Disease Activity Index (sCDAI) and simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI), indicated remission. Pattern of use of NSAIDs was measured at baseline, and disease activity assessment was performed 6 months later. We used multivariate binomial regression to determine effects of NSAIDs on disease activity. RESULTS A total of 791 individuals in remission had baseline and follow data available for analysis. Of these, 247 Crohnâs disease (CD) patients (43.2%) and 89 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (40.6%) reported NSAID use. CD patients with NSAID use â¥ 5 times/monthly had greater risk of active disease at follow-up (23% v. 15%, p=0.04); (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12â2.44). No effect was observed in patients with UC (22% vs 21%, p=0.98; adjusted RR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.81â1.92). Acetaminophen use was associated with active disease at follow-up in CD (adjusted RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.11â2.68). CONCLUSIONS Regular (â¥ 5 times/monthly) NSAID and acetaminophen use were associated with active CD, but not UC. Less frequent NSAID use was not associated with active CD or UC. These findings indicate that regular NSAID use may increase CD activity, or that NSAID use may be a marker of a less robust remission; thus reflecting subclinical disease activity.

The cause of lower extremity injuries is the impulsive impact that occurs on foot strike. At 800 foot strikes per mile, a 150-pound runner will be subjected to forces of 120 tons per foot per mile. The use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in runners has become widespread. This is especially true in the case of marathon runners who use NSAIDs like piroxicam to relieve their overuse pains so they can continue to run with injuries, although this use is not advocated. NSAIDs do, however, play a role in treating many running injuries and can help the runner return to his chosen sport.\n\n[Mefenamic acid and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in dental practice.

However, there are several notions in the literature that this drug is less well-tolerated than other NSAID because over a prolonged period of application more lesions of the upper gastro-intestinal tract are induced as well as occasionally renal insufficiency. Compared to other NSAID the systemic toxicity starts already with relatively low doses above the maximal daily dose.

In this paper we described our experience on NSAIDs misuse (both prescribing and OTC formulations), particularly relevant in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis (39.5 percent of patients) and osteoarthritis (47 percent of patients). We also evaluated causes underlying NSAIDs misuse (e.g. not satisfactory pain control, other painful conditions, etc).\n\n[Recommendation for the prevention and treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal ulcers and its complications].\n\nPubMed\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a broad class of non glucocorticoid drugs which are extensively used in anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic therapies. However, NSAIDs may cause many side effects, most commonly in gastrointestinal(GI) tract. Cardiovascular system, kidney, liver, central nervous system and hematopoietic system are also involved. NSAID-induced GI side effects not only endanger the patients' health, increase mortality, but also greatly increase the cost of medical care. Therefore, how to reduce GI side effects is of particular concern to clinicians. The Chinese Rheumatism Data Center(CRDC) and Chinese Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Treatment and Research Group(CSTAR) compose a \"Recommendation for the prevention and treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal ulcers and its complications\" , as following: (1) GI lesions are the most common side effects of NSAIDs. (2) NSAID-induced GI side effects include gastritis, esophagitis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, bleeding, perforation and obstruction. (3) With the application of capsule endoscopy and small intestinal endoscopy, growing attention is being paid to the NASID-induced small intestine mucosa damage, which is mainly erosion and ulcer. (4) Risk factors related to NSAID-induced GI ulcers include: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection, age> 65 years, past history of GI ulcers, high doses of NSAIDs, multiple-drug combination therapy, and comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and nephropathy.(5) GI and cardiovascular function should be evaluated before using NSAIDs and gastric mucosal protective agents. (6) The risk of GI ulcers and complications caused by selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors is less than that of non-selective COX-2 inhibitors. (7)Hp eradication therapy helps to cure GI ulcers and prevent recurrence when Hp infection is positive in NSAID-induced ulcers.

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of NEO and of the different NSAIDs produced dose-dependent antinociception in the acetic acid writhing test of the mouse. 4. The i.p. or i.t. co-administration of fixed ratios of ED(50) fractions of NSAIDs and NEO, resulted to be synergistic or supra-additive for the combinations ketoprofen (KETO) and NEO, paracetamol (PARA) and NEO) and diclofenac (DICLO) and NEO administered i.p. However, the same combinations administered i.t. were only additive. In addition, the combinations meloxicam (MELO) and NEO and piroxicam (PIRO) and NEO, administered either i.p. or i.t., were additive. 5. The results suggest that the co-administration of NEO with some NSAIDs (e.g. KETO, PARA or DICLO) resulted in a synergistic interaction, which may provide evidence of supraspinal antinociception modulation by the increased acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft of cholinergic interneurons.

Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between a physician's years of experience and the number of prescription issued, as well as the presence of risk factors and side effects in the patients who received these prescriptions. A clinical audit was conducted in four primary health care centers in the Muscat region over a one-week period in April 2014. The target population included patients aged 18 years or over who attended one of the four health centers and were prescribed NSAIDs. Overall, 272 patients were recruited by systematic random sampling. The data were collected by two methods: direct face-to-face interviews and evaluations of the patient's electronic medical file. The prescribing doctors were blind to the audit. The collected information included patients demographics, past and current medical history of related comorbidities, NSAID type, dose, duration and indications for use, concomitant warfarin or/and aspirin prescriptions, and co-prescription of gastroprotective agents. In total, 15% of patients received an NSAID prescription: females were issued more prescriptions than males. The percentage of patients who received an NSAID prescription across the health centers ranged from 9% to 24%. The main reason for prescribing NSAIDs was musculoskeletal problems. The most frequently prescribed NSAID was ibuprofen. Sixteen percent of patients who received an NSAID prescription had a risk factor related to its use. The mean and median duration of the NSAID prescriptions of all types were 5.6 and 5.0 days, respectively. Physicians with a greater number of years experience prescribed more NSAIDs. Our study showed that the number of prescriptions of NSAIDs among various institutes varied, which could reflect the level of awareness concerning NSAID risks among the prescribing\n\nDoes aspirin or non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use prevent colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBurr, Nick E; Hull, Mark A; Subramanian, Venkataraman\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To determine whether aspirin or non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NA-NSAIDs) prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched for articles reporting the risk of CRC in patients with IBD related to aspirin or NA-NSAID use. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95%CIs were determined using a random-effects model. Publication bias was assessed using Funnel plots and Eggerâs test. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochranâs Q and the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 14917 patients and 3 studies involving 1282 patients provided data on the risk of CRC in patients with IBD taking NA-NSAIDs and aspirin respectively. The pooled OR of developing CRC after exposure to NA-NSAIDs in patients with IBD was 0.80 (95%CI: 0.39-1.21) and after exposure to aspirin it was 0.66 (95%CI: 0.06-1.39). There was significant heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) between the studies. There was no change in the effect estimates on subgroup analyses of the population studied or whether adjustment or matching was performed. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of high quality evidence on this important clinical topic. From the available evidence NA-NSAID or aspirin use does not appear to be chemopreventative for CRC in patients with IBD.

The high consumption and the uncontrolled disposal of unused drugs into municipal waste or their deposit in landfills can result in an increased concentration of these compounds in soils. Moreover, these drugs can affect the microbial activity. However, there is a lack of knowledge about these effects or it is very limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the impact of selected commercially available NSAIDs, i.e., diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NPX), ibuprofen (IBF) and ketoprofen (KTP), applied at concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/kg soil, on the activity of soil microorganisms during the 90-day experiment. To ascertain this impact, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), soil enzyme activities, i.e., dehydrogenase (DHA), acid and alkaline phosphatases (PHOS-H and PHOS-OH) and urease (URE) as well as changes in the rates of nitrification and ammonification processes were determined. In addition, the number of culturable bacteria and fungi were enumerated. In general, the obtained data showed a significant stimulatory effect of NSAIDs on the microbial activity. Higher concentrations of NSAIDs caused a greater effect, which was observed for SIR, PHOS-H, PHOS-OH, URE, N-NO3- and N-NH4+, even during the whole incubation period. Moreover, the number of heterotrophic bacteria and fungi increased significantly during the experiment, which was probably a consequence of the evolution of specific microorganisms that were capable of degrading NSAIDs and used them as an additional source of carbon and energy. However, an inhibitory effect of NPX, IBF or KTP for SIR, DHA, on both phosphatases and culturable bacteria and fungi was observed at the beginning of the experiment. At lower concentrations of NSAIDs, in turn, the effects were negligible or transient. In conclusion, the application of NSAIDs altered the biochemical and microbial activity of soil what may\n\nEffect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications on the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPopat, Rita A; Tanner, Caroline M; van den Eeden, Stephen K; Bernstein, Allan L; Bloch, Daniel A; Leimpeter, Amethyst; McGuire, Valerie; Nelson, Lorene M\n\n2007-06-01\n\nInflammatory processes may be involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We examined the association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with the risk of ALS in case-control study of incident cases (n = 111) conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California during the years 1996-2000. Controls (n = 258) randomly selected from the same population were frequency matched by age and gender to the ALS cases. Information regarding use of NSAIDs (non-aspirin and aspirin) and three classes of 'control' medications was collected by in-person structured interview. Subjects who used medication at least twice a week for at least a month were classified as 'ever users'. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, gender, history of osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis and pain, and other medication use. Overall, there was no association between NSAID use and ALS; however, some sex differences were noted for non-aspirin NSAID use. Among men, non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with a two-fold increased risk of ALS (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.9), whereas among women, non-aspirin NSAID use was not associated with increased ALS risk (adjusted OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-1.2). ALS risk was not associated with aspirin use or with 'control' medications. This study did not find any evidence to suggest that NSAID use reduces the risk of ALS. The observed sex differences with non-aspirin NSAID use could be due to chance or an unmeasured confounder.\n\nStructural Mechanism of the Interaction of Alzheimer Disease AÎ² Fibrils with the Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Sulindac Sulfide.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrade, Elke; Bittner, Heiko J; Sarkar, Riddhiman; Lopez Del Amo, Juan Miguel; Althoff-Ospelt, Gerhard; Multhaup, Gerd; Hildebrand, Peter W; Reif, Bernd\n\n2015-11-27\n\nAlzheimer disease is the most severe neurodegenerative disease worldwide. In the past years, a plethora of small molecules interfering with amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) aggregation has been reported. However, their mode of interaction with amyloid fibers is not understood. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known Î³-secretase modulators; they influence AÎ² populations. It has been suggested that NSAIDs are pleiotrophic and can interact with more than one pathomechanism. Here we present a magic angle spinning solid-state NMR study demonstrating that the NSAID sulindac sulfide interacts specifically with Alzheimer disease AÎ² fibrils. We find that sulindac sulfide does not induce drastic architectural changes in the fibrillar structure but intercalates between the two Î²-strands of the amyloid fibril and binds to hydrophobic cavities, which are found consistently in all analyzed structures. The characteristic Asp(23)-Lys(28) salt bridge is not affected upon interacting with sulindac sulfide. The primary binding site is located in the vicinity of residue Gly(33), a residue involved in Met(35) oxidation. The results presented here will assist the search for pharmacologically active molecules that can potentially be employed as lead structures to guide the design of small molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

Recently it has been suggested that the evidence for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) treatment is sufficient to support its regular clinical use. Primary objective in this systematic review was to assess efficacy and safety of NSAID treatment in improving body weight and muscle mass in patients with cancer cachexia. Secondary objectives were to assess whether this treatment could improve other cachexia domains such as anorexia and food intake, catabolic drive and function. A systematic literature review of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central register of controlled trials database was carried out using both text words and MeSH/EMTREE terms. Thirteen studies were included; all but two trials showed either improvement or stabilization in weight or lean body mass. Seven studies were without a comparator. Studies are generally small and a few are methodologically flawed, often due to multiple outcomes with excess risk of false positives. NSAIDs may improve weight in cancer patients with cachexia, and there is some evidence on effect on physical performance, self-reported quality of life and inflammatory parameters. Evidence is too frail to recommend NSAID for cachexia outside clinical trials. This is supported by the known side effects of NSAIDs, even though the reviewed literature report almost negligible toxicity.\n\nNon-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs As Host-Directed Therapy for Tuberculosis: A Systematic Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKroesen, Vera M.; GrÃ¶schel, Matthias I.; Martinson, Neil; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maeurer, Markus; van der Werf, Tjip S.; Vilaplana, Cristina\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLengthy, antimicrobial therapy targeting the pathogen is the mainstay of conventional tuberculosis treatment, complicated by emerging drug resistances. Host-directed therapies, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in contrast, target host factors to mitigate disease severity. In the present Systematic Review, we investigate whether NSAIDs display any effects as therapy of TB and discuss possible mechanisms of action of NSAIDs as adjunctive therapy of TB. Ten studies, seven preclinical studies in mice and three clinical trials, were included and systematically reviewed. Our results point toward a beneficial effect of NSAIDs as adjunct to current TB therapy regimens, mediated by decreased lung pathology balancing host-immune reaction. The determination of the best timing for their administration in order to obtain the potential beneficial effects needs further investigation. Even if the preclinical evidence requires clinical evaluation, NSAIDs might represent a potential safe, simple, and cheap improvement in therapy of TB.

The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cancer prevention treatments has been promising in numerous cancers. We report the evaluation of NSAIDs chemically modified by the addition of a redox-active nitroxide group. TEMPO-aspirin (TEMPO-ASA) and TEMPO-indomethacin (TEMPO-IND) were synthesized and evaluated in the lung cancer cell line A549. We evaluated physico-chemical properties of TEMPO-ASA and TEMPO-IND by electron paramagnetic resonance and cyclic voltammetry. Superoxide dismutase-like properties was assayed by measuring cytochrome c reduction and anti-inflammatory effects were assayed by measuring production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2) ) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4) ). MTT proliferation assay and clonogenic assay were evaluated in the A549 lung carcinoma cell line. Maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and acute ulcerogenic index were also evaluated in in vivo. MTD were: TEMPO (140 mgÂ·kg(-1) ), ASA (100 mgÂ·kg(-1) ), indomethacin (5 mgÂ·kg(-1) ), TEMPO-ASA (100 mgÂ·kg(-1) ) and TEMPO-IND (40 mgÂ·kg(-1) ). While TEMPO-ASA was as well tolerated as ASA, TEMPO-IND showed an eightfold improvement over indomethacin. TEMPO-IND showed markedly less gastric toxicity than the parent NSAID. Both TEMPO-ASA and TEMPO-IND inhibited production of PGE(2) and LTB(4) in A549 cells with maximum effects at 100 ÂµgÂ·mL(-1) or 10 ÂµgÂ·mL(-1) respectively. The nitroxide-NSAIDs retained superoxide scavenging capacity of the parent nitroxide and anti-inflammatory effects, inhibiting cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes.

It often follows changes in retinal blood vessels which enhance the fluid to come out of vessels. Although it may be asymptomatic, symptoms are primarily painless loss of central vision, often with the complaint of seeing black spots in front of the eye.It is reported that CMO may resolve spontaneously, or fluctuate for months, before causing loss of vision. If left untreated or undiagnosed, progression of CMO may lead to permanent visual loss.It has been noted that patients with diabetic retinopathy have elevated inflammatory markers, and therefore it is likely that inflammation aids in the progression of vascular disease in these patients. Several topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ketorolac 0.5%, bromfenac 0.09%, and nepafenac 0.1%, have therefore also been used topically to treat chronic diabetic CMO. Hence this review was conducted to find out the effects of topical NSAIDs in diabetic CMO. To assess the effects of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for diabetic cystoid macular oedema (CMO).

All Danish citizens aged 10 or above 1 January 1997 were included in the study. The national prescription registry was used to identify all claimed prescriptions for NSAIDs by the cohort until 2005. By individual-level-linkage of nationwide registries, information was acquired concerning hospitalizations, comorbidity, concomitant pharmacotherapy and socioeconomic factors. The population consisted of 4,614,807 individuals, of which 2,663,706 (57.8%) claimed at least one prescription for NSAID from 1997 to 2005. Ibuprofen and diclofenac were the most frequently used non-selective NSAIDs, whereas rofecoxib and celecoxib were the most frequently used selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. The usage was similar across all age groups. Female sex and increasing age was associated with increased use of NSAID. Factors predicting extensive NSAID use were: rheumatic disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69-1.90), gout agents (allopurinol) (OR = 2.54, CI: 2.44-2.64) and other pain medication (OR = 3.27, CI: 3.23-3.31). NSAIDs were most often prescribed for use for one distinct treatment interval and for a short period (overall inter-quartile range [IQR]: 9-66 days). High doses were used in a relatively large proportion of the population (8.9% for etodolac to 19.5% for celecoxib) and 54,373 (2.0%) claimed prescriptions for more than one NSAID at the same time. NSAIDs were commonly used in the Danish population. Since NSAIDs have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, further research on the overall risk associated with these drugs on a national scale is needed.\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: What is the actual risk of liver damage?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBessone, Fernando\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) constitute a family of drugs, which taken as a group, represents one of the most frequently prescribed around the world. Thus, not surprisingly NSAIDs, along with anti-infectious agents, list on the top for causes of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). The incidence of liver disease induced by NSAIDs reported in clinical studies is fairly uniform ranging from 0.29/100 000 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-051] to 9/100 000 (95% CI: 6-15). However, compared with these results, a higher risk of liver-related hospitalizations was reported (3-23 per 100 000 patients). NSAIDs exhibit a broad spectrum of liver damage ranging from asymptomatic, transient, hyper-transaminasemia to fulminant hepatic failure. However, under-reporting of asymptomatic, mild cases, as well as of those with transient liver-tests alteration, in conjunction with reports non-compliant with pharmacovigilance criteria to ascertain DILI and flawed epidemiological studies, jeopardize the chance to ascertain the actual risk of NSAIDs hepatotoxicity. Several NSAIDs, namely bromfenac, ibufenac and benoxaprofen, have been withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity; others like nimesulide were never marketed in some countries and withdrawn in others. Indeed, the controversy concerning the actual risk of severe liver disease persists within NSAIDs research. The present work intends (1) to provide a critical analysis of the dissimilar results currently available in the literature concerning the epidemiology of NSAIDS hepatotoxicity; and (2) to review the risk of hepatotoxicity for each one of the most commonly employed compounds of the NSAIDs family, based on past and recently published data.

A cross-sectional observational study was performed in 2576 patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs recruited prospectively in the French primary care system. Thirty-nine percent of the patients (n=1002) received gastroprotective agents, mostly proton pump inhibitors (99.5%). In patients with a single risk factor, the gastroprotection rates were: 50% for age>65, 67% for concurrent use of corticosteroids or antithrombotics, and 87% and 100% for history of uncomplicated and complicated gastroduodenal ulcers. In patients without risk factors, gastroprotective agents were prescribed in 31.8%. Among them, two thirds had symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux or history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance or dyspepsia. Conversely, 40% (n=256) of at-risk non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users did not receive gastroprotective agents. Gastroprotection was significantly associated with history of gastroduodenal ulcer (OR: 8.2; 95%CI: 4.3-15.6) or history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance (OR: 6; 95%CI: 4.5-8.1), gastro-oesophageal reflux (OR: 6; 95%CI: 4.4-8.2), dyspepsia (OR: 5.2; 95%CI: 3.7-7.5), concurrent gastrotoxic treatment (OR: 3.3; 95%CI: 1.9-5.6) and age>65 (OR: 3; 95%CI: 2.3-4.1). Despite widespread recommendations, gastroprotection is still largely underprescribed in patients at risk of gastrointestinal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug complications in France. Only half of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users above 65 years are prescribed gastroprotective agents. Copyright Â© 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of five frequently used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, diflunisal, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid and piroxicam in 0.1Â mgÂ ml(-1) concentration) in batch cultures of cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus, Microcystis aeruginosa, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii), and eukaryotic algae (Desmodesmus communis, Haematococcus pluvialis, Cryptomonas ovata) were studied. Furthermore, the effects of the same concentrations of NSAIDs were investigated in natural algal assemblages in microcosms. According to the changes of chlorophyll-a content, unicellular cyanobacteria seemed to be more tolerant to NSAIDs than eukaryotic algae in laboratory experiments. Growth of eukaryotic algae was reduced by all drugs, the cryptomonad C.Â ovata was the most sensitive to NSAIDs, while the flagellated green alga H.Â pluvialis was more sensitive than the non-motile green alga D. communis. NSAID treatments had weaker impact in the natural assemblages dominated by cyanobacteria than in the ones dominated by eukaryotic algae, confirming the results of laboratory experiments. Diversity and number of functional groups did not change notably in cyanobacteria dominated assemblages, while they decreased significantly in eukaryotic algae dominated ones compared to controls. The results highlight that cyanobacteria (especially unicellular ones) are less sensitive to the studied, mostly hardly degradable NSAIDs, which suggest that their accumulation in water bodies may contribute to the expansion of cyanobacterial mass productions in appropriate environmental circumstances by pushing back eukaryotic algae. Thus, these contaminants require special attention during wastewater treatment and monitoring of surface waters. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Relatively large quantities of prostaglandins have been found in gut mucosa, suggesting that these substances play an important role in gastrointestinal physiology. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause damage to the gastric, intestinal, and colonic mucosa in experimental animals and in humans. Prostaglandins protect the gastric mucosa against injury induced by NSAIDs, and this property has been labelled cytoprotection. The mechanisms of cytoprotection have been extensively evaluated and are probably multifactorial, including effects on the gastric mucosal barrier, gastric blood flow, mucus, bicarbonate, and fluid section, ionic transport, cyclic AMP, and surface-active phospholipids. Prostaglandins may also prevent NSAID-induced injury in the small intestine and colon. The mechanisms responsible for prostaglandin protection in the lower gut against injurious agents are unknown. Further studies of the role of prostaglandins in the gut and their relationship to the effects of NSAIDs are needed. The results of these investigations may lead to a better understanding of the importance of prostaglandins in the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract, and may provide information regarding actions of NSAIDs on the functional integrity of the gastric, intestinal, and colonic mucosa.\n\nBenign stricture of the oesophagus: role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilkins, W E; Ridley, M G; Pozniak, A L\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe medication history of patients presenting with benign oesophageal stricture is compared with an age and sex matched control population selected from the community. Fifty five out of 151 consecutive admissions to a dysphagia clinic were found to have benign oesophageal stricture. Twenty six out of 53 (49%) had been prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the year preceding their clinic appointment. Ten patients (19%) had been prescribed other drugs implicated in oesophageal disease over the same period. In the control population, 20 out of 165 (12%) had been prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 31 out of 165 had been prescribed 'other' drugs in the preceding year. The difference between numbers on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the patient and control groups was highly significant (X2 = 23.87, p less than 0.1%). This study has shown an association between the prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and benign stricture of the oesophagus.

The special population at risk (with repeated and high energy overuse because of occupational or sport activities) and the pathology of their syndromes are identified. Mode of action, pharmacological properties of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the unwanted effects of their application especially in infants and elderly are highlighted.

The EVIDENCE study quantified the incidence of symptomatic uncomplicated and/or complicated GI events in at-risk European patients treated with NSAIDs in real-life practice. This non-interventional study assessed 4144 adults with at least one GI risk factor who recently initiated NSAID therapy for osteoarthritis (85%), rheumatoid arthritis (11%), ankylosing spondylitis (3%) or a combination (1%). Patient characteristics and medical history were collected from medical records. GI events (upper and lower) were recorded at in-clinic visits during 6â months' follow-up. Mean time on index NSAID at enrolment was 33â days. The incidence (per 100 person-years) was 18.5 per 100 person-years for uncomplicated GI events and 0.7 per 100 person-years for complicated GI events. Upper GI events were far more common (12%) than lower GI events (1%) during study follow-up (median 182â days (range 61-320)). Other reported rates for cardiovascular, anaemia or non-GI events were much less frequent. A minority (28%) of patients had ongoing proton pump inhibitor use at enrolment, with strong variation by practice and country. EVIDENCE is the largest prospective study of the real-life management of European patients treated with NSAIDs for rheumatic diseases and at increased GI risk. It shows that GI events from the upper GI tract are far more common than those from the lower GI tract. It also shows adherence to guidelines for gastroprotection is generally low. NCT01176682.

Six patients had consumed drugs known to cause oesophageal ulceration (emepronium bromide and potassium preparations). Of the remaining 70 patients, 22 had regularly taken a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug before the onset of dysphagia compared with 10 patients in a control group matched for age and sex; this difference was significant (p less than 0.02). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have a causative role in the formation of oesophageal stricture in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux, in whom they should be prescribed with caution.

However, there is no systematic review to assess the effects of NSAIDs in treating the common cold. To determine the effects of NSAIDs versus placebo (and other treatments) on signs and symptoms of the common cold, and to determine any adverse effects of NSAIDs in people with the common cold. We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2013) and ProQuest Digital Dissertations (January 1938 to April 2013). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NSAIDS in adults or children with the common cold. Four review authors extracted data. We subdivided trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs. We extracted and summarised data on global efficacies of analgesic effects (such as reduction of headache and myalgia), non-analgesic effects (such as reduction of nasal symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing) and side effects. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We pooled data using the fixed- and random-effects models. We included nine RCTs with 1069 participants, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was mixed. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.24, three studies, random-effects model), or duration of colds (MD -0.23, 95% CI -1.75 to 1.29, two studies, random-effects model). For respiratory symptoms, cough did not improve (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.56, two studies, random-effects model) but the sneezing score significantly improved (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.12, two\n\n[Trends of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use in Spain, 1990 through 2003].\n\nPubMed\n\nde Abajo, F J; del Pozo, J GarcÃ­a; del Pino, A\n\n2005-11-01\n\nTo know the trends of supply, consumption and pattern of use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Spain from 1990 through 2003, as well as their costs. Drug utilization study. National Health System, outpatient setting. Information on drug utilization was obtained from the ALHAQUEM database of the Spanish Ministry of Health, which contains the number of packages sold in community pharmacies and charged to the National Health System. Data were expressed in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD). NSAIDs consumption in Spain increased from 23.67 DHD in 1990 to 45.82 DHD in 2003 (a 93.6% increase). Ibuprofen was the NSAID which showed the greatest increase (15.33 DHD in 2003). The consumption of coxibs reached a maximum of 7.74 DHD in 2001, but decreased to 3.59 DHD in 2003 once prior-authorization programs were set up. Over the study period the share of NSAIDs use with a low gastrointestinal risk increased from 29% to 59%. Overall costs of NSAIDs increased from 117 million euro in 1990 to 329 million euro in 2003. Over the study period the consumption of NSAIDs in Spain has increased twofold while costs increased threefold. The pattern of use has remarkably changed showing an increasing use of NSAIDs with a better gastrointestinal profile. The impact of coxibs marketing has been moderate.\n\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use reduce gastric cancer risk: A dose-response meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Xuan-Zhang; Chen, You; Wu, Jian; Zhang, Xi; Wu, Cong-Cong; Zhang, Chao-Ying; Sun, Shuang-Shuang; Chen, Wen-Jun\n\n2017-01-17\n\nThe association between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and gastric cancer (GC) risk is controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of NSAIDs for GC. A literature search was performed for relevant studies using the PubMed and Embase database (up to March 2016). Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the effect measures. The dose-response analysis and subgroup analysis were also performed. Twenty-four studies were included. Our results indicated that NSAIDs could reduce GC risk (any NSAIDs: RR=0.78, 96%CI=0.72-0.85; aspirin: RR=0.70, 95%CI=0.62-0.80; non-aspirin NSAIDs: RR=0.86, 95%CI=0.80-0.94), especially for non-cardia GC risk. Moreover, the dose-response analysis indicated the risk of GC decreased by 11% and 5% for 2 years increment of any NSAIDs and aspirin use, respectively. There were nonlinear relationships between the frequency of any NSAIDs use and aspirin use and GC risk (P for non-linearity<0.01), with a threshold effect of 5 times/week. A monotonically decreasing trend was observed only for the frequency of less than 5 times/week. Our results indicate that NSAIDs is inversely associated with GC risk, especially for non-cardia GC risk. NSAIDs use may become a feasible approach to prevent GC.\n\nPostoperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colorectal anastomotic leakage. NSAIDs and anastomotic leakage.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlein, Mads\n\n2012-03-01\n\nAnastomotic leakage (AL) is the most important and one of the most serious complications after colorectal resections with primary anastomosis. Any factors that contribute to increase the risk of AL should be identified and--if possible--eliminated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used for treating pain after surgical procedures, among these also colorectal resections. The objective of this Ph.d. thesis was to investigate whether the use of NSAIDs in the postoperative period increases the risk of AL, and investigate the effect on pathophysiological mechanisms. In order to achieve this, the following studies were performed. Study I was a retrospective, case-control study in 75 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection for colorectal cancer. 33 of these patients received the NSAID diclofenac in the postoperative period; the remaining 42 did not receive any NSAID. There were significantly more ALs among the patients receiving diclofenac (7/33 vs. 1/42, p=0.018). In uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses, diclofenac was the only factor associated with increased AL rate. This study functioned as a hypothesis generating study and laid the ground for the subsequent studies. Study II was an experimental, randomized, case-control study in 32 Wistar rats. The rats had a colonic anastomosis performed and were randomized to diclofenac or placebo treatment. After three days, the rats were sacrificed and the anastomoses were harvested. First, the anastomotic strengths were tested by longitudinal; subsequently, the levels of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the anastomotic tissues were measured. There was no difference among the groups with regard to anastomotic strength, but the animals treated with diclofenac had significantly lower COX-2 levels (median (range) 1.30 (0.42-3.31) ng/mg vs. 2.44 (0.88 - 18.94) ng/mg, p<0.001).

However, even more attention is placed upon the recurrence of digestive system complications in the course of their use. Recent data suggests that the complications of the lower gastro-intestinal tract may be as frequent and severe as those of the upper tract. NSAIDs enteropathy is due to enterohepatic recycling of the drugs resulting in a prolonged and repeated exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the compound and its metabolites. Thus leading to so-called topical effects, which, in turn, lead to an impairment of the intestinal barrier. This process determines bacterial translocation and toxic substances of intestinal origin in the portal circulation, leading to an endotoxaemia. This condition could determine a liver inflammatory response and might promote the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, mostly in patients with risk factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and a high fat diet, which may induce a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis. This alteration of gut microbiota may contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its related disorders in two ways: firstly causing a malfunction of the tight junctions that play a critical role in the increase of intestinal permeability, and then secondly leading to the development of insulin resistance, body weight gain, lipogenesis, fibrogenesis and hepatic oxidative stress.\n\nRole of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on intestinal permeability and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUtzeri, Erika; Usai, Paolo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is widespread worldwide thanks to their analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects.

To identify factors that predict the overuse of gastroprotective strategies in low-risk non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users. We distributed a questionnaire to family doctors and general internists consisting of a clinical vignette describing a low-risk hypothetical patient with osteoarthritis who was a candidate for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Respondents were asked whether they would prescribe this patient a gastroprotective strategy and to estimate the annual risk of that patient developing a gastrointestinal complication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Respondents inappropriately recommending a gastroprotective strategy were compared with respondents who opted not to use gastroprotection. We received 340 responses (response rate of 28.3%), of which 278 supplied analysable data. Thirty-five percent of respondents inappropriately recommended a gastroprotective strategy for the low-risk subject. Inappropriate prescribers were significantly more likely to overestimate the risk of gastrointestinal complications with traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and this was strongly predictive of gastroprotective strategy recommendation in logistic regression. Many doctors inappropriately recommend gastroprotective strategies in low-risk non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users. Improving doctors' awareness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastrointestinal risks may lead to a decrease in inappropriate utilization of gastroprotective strategies in low-risk patients.\n\nCause for concern in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications in the community -a population-based study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications are a common cause of reported adverse drug side-effects. This study describes the prevalence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) use (other than low-dose aspirin) and the presence of co-existing relative contraindications to NSAID use and chronic conditions in a representative population sample. Methods Data were analysed from 3,206 adults attending first follow-up of the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS) in 2004 - 2006, a longitudinal representative population study. Medications were brought into study clinic visits by participants. Clinical assessment included measured blood pressure, kidney function, serum cholesterol, blood glucose. Questionnaires assessed demographics, lifestyle risk factors, physician-diagnosed chronic conditions. Data were weighted to census measures by region, age group, gender, and probability of selection in the household, to provide population representative estimates. Pearson's Chi-square tests determined significant differences in proportions. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations of socio-demographic characteristics with use of NSAIDs. Results Of 3,175 participants, 357 (11.2%), and 16% of those aged > 55 years, reported using either non-specific NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, other than low-dose aspirin. Among people using NSAIDs, 60.8% had hypertension, 30.8% had Stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease, 17.2% had a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 20.7% had a > 15% 10-year CVD risk. The prevalence of NSAID use among people with hypertension was 16%, with kidney disease 15.9%, and a history of CVD 20.0%. Among people taking diuretics, 24.1% were also taking NSAIDs, and of those taking medications for gastro-esophageal reflux, 24.7% were on NSAIDs. Prescription-only COX-2 inhibitors, but not other NSAIDs, were used more by people > 75 years than by 35-54 year olds (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.0, 6.7), and also were more commonly used by\n\nUtilization of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in Quebec: adherence to the Canadian consensus on prescription guidelines.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoride, Yola; Ducruet, Thierry; Boivin, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Lavoie, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Rochon, Sophie\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAdverse events associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have led to the publication of Canadian prescription guidelines. Prescription practices following the publication of these guidelines and the introduction of COX-2 inhibitors in the Quebec formulary of reimbursed medications remain largely unexplored. To compare the prevalence of contra-indications and selected risk factors for NSAID-toxicity among COX-2 inhibitor users and non-selective NSAID users. A case-control analysis was conducted in a random sample of Quebec adult drug plan members who were treated with celecoxib (n=42,422 cases), rofecoxib (n=25,674 cases), full-dose (anti-inflammatory doses) of non-selective NSAIDs (n=9,673 cases), or low-dose NSAIDs (n=2,745 controls) in the year 2000. Data were obtained from the Quebec prescription and medical services databases (RAMQ). Patients with a history of gastropathy were more likely to be prescribed COX-2 inhibitors than low-dose NSAIDs; the odds ratios were 1.73 (95%CI: 1.56-1.91) and 1.49 (1.33-1.66), respectively for celecoxib and rofecoxib.
