        "text": "Ben Moody, guitarist of We Are The Fallen, started out as the co-founder of the alternative rock band, Evanescence. After leaving in October 2003 during the European tour, he moved on to a solo project and began producing songs for other artists.\n\nThe list includes Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, Lindsay Lohan, Bo Bice, Godhead, 3Faced, Daughtry and Celine Dion. He has also been producing, writing and touring with singer-songwriter Hana Pestle.\n\nBen has released songs on both The Punisher and Fantastic Four soundtracks (the former also features fellow Evanescence co-founder, Amy Lee performing with Seether).On Tuesday December 16, 2008 he released his Mutiny Bootleg EP, which came free with a copy of Hana Pestle's EP that night.\n\nMoody is quoted as saying \"there’s a duet between Hana and I on there that won't be on the record and won’t be released anywhere ever again. It’s free because I want this sh*t spread everywhere, so be sure that all your friends share the four songs with as many people as possible!\" The EP is therefore available for free download from http://drop.\n\nio/benmoodymutinybootlegep.His debut solo album, All For This, featuring Hana Pestle on backing vocals, has been in the works since 2005 and was released June 9, 2009 on iTunes, Amazon MP3 and Amie Street via his own record label.\n\nThe physical release is forthcoming.We Are The Fallen, featuring Ben Moody, John LeCompt and Rocky Gray (all formerly of Evanescence), along with Carly Smithson and Marty O'Brien, debuted on June 22, 2009 with the song \"Bury Me Alive.\n\n\"www.benmoody.com"
