        "text": "In response to Rolling Stone’s recently released list noting the “30 Best Songs of 2016 So Far,” I thought I would compile my own set of thirty, organized in alphabetical order. Some of these tracks have been mentioned in previous “Friday Music Focus” blog posts, but given how good the music is, I relish the opportunity to promote any and all of it again. (Given the abundance of tunes here, I minimized the accompanying text to one line for each entry.) In most cases I have included non-video clips so that you can focus on the music rather than on visuals, but a few examples called for music videos or live performances that I felt would enhance those experiences. Enjoy!\n\nArgument City, “Spirit of ’58” – A barnstormer of an anthem from a young band that I expect to do more great things; the song was written to support the Welsh football team in this year’s Euro 2016 tournament.\n\nBat for Lashes, “Sunday Love” – Swirling synths mesmerize the listener in this tale from Natasha Khan (aka Bat for Lashes), a track from upcoming concept album The Bride.\n\nBlossoms, “At Most a Kiss” – This indie group has been getting quite a bit of press in the UK, as well they should since this particular earworm is one of the catchiest singles of the year.\n\nDavid Bowie, “Girl Loves Me” – Right up to the end, Bowie was weird, off-kilter, funny, spellbinding, totally his own creation.\n\nDJ Shadow feat. Run the Jewels, “Nobody Speak” – You have three minutes to psych out your enemies… go!\n\nGarbage, “Empty” – “Good things come to those that wait, or so they say,” sings Shirley Manson; I’m sure that Garbage fans agree after hearing this welcome return for the band.\n\nGuy Garvey, “Open the Door” – Watching the music video for the new solo single by Elbow frontman Guy Garvey, performing with in-studio brass players, is as enjoyable as listening to it on the radio (it gets played quite a bit on BBC Radio 6 Music).\n\nMargaret Glaspy, “You and I” – Her low-key style of singing, sense of humor and ear for guitar hooks remind me of a combination of Courtney Barnett and Elliott Smith.\n\nHANA, “Underwater” – A somewhat eerie, somewhat Massive Attack-esque soundscape courtesy of Montana-bred singer-songwriter Hana Pestle.\n\nMick Harvey, “A Violent Poison (That’s What Love Is) [Un Poison Violent C’est Ça L’amour]” – Mick Harvey has done it all in the last four decades – guitarist and drummer for the Boys Next Door/the Birthday Party; pianist and drummer for Crime & the City Solution; drummer, guitarist, bassist, pianist/keyboardist/organist (and probably much more) for Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds; drummer on Rowland S. Howard’s two solo albums; co-producer of PJ Harvey’s Mercury Prize-winning albums Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000) and Let England Shake (2011); all the while making solo albums for the last twenty years – and I’m happy to say he has returned with a third album of translated Serge Gainsbourg covers, Delirium Tremens (the previous two being Intoxicated Man (1995) and Pink Elephants (1997)).\n\nPJ Harvey, “The Wheel” – A five-and-a-half-minute epic about the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe, a survey of victims who are stuck in a cycle of violence that people have done little or nothing to prevent (“Hey little children don’t disappear/I heard it was 28,000/Lost upon a revolving wheel/I heard it was 28,000…”).\n\nHelen Love, “A Boy from Wales Called Gareth Bale” – Veteran Welsh indie group Helen Love released an absolutely delightful dance track in support of the nation’s star football player, a song complete with samples of sports commentary, lines from Dylan Thomas’s “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” quotations from St. David (patron saint of Wales) and all of it wrapped up in a music video that looks like it was made on a near-zero budget with the Windows Movie Maker computer program.\n\nMeilyr Jones, “Return to Life” – Inspired by a number of life-changing events that happened three years ago (hence the name of his new album, 2013), the Welsh-born singer-songwriter has crafted a lovely song that ends with an on-the-street recording of a Japanese accordionist whom Jones often saw busking in Rome.\n\nAlicia Keys, “Hallelujah” (live on “SNL”) – I chose this live version of Keys’ new single, rather than the studio recording, since this performance has a more impassioned vocal and a less abrupt ending (here Keys really draws the last notes out).\n\nThe Kills, “Heart of a Dog” – American vocalist Alison Mosshart and English guitarist Jamie Hince return after a five-year hiatus with their new album, Ash & Ice, and this excellent second single, which has attitude to burn.\n\nThe Last Shadow Puppets, “Aviation” (live on “The Late Late Show”) – The last time I played this track at a party it didn’t get much of a reception, but maybe that’s because the listeners didn’t have the advantage of watching Alex Turner doing his hip-shaking and hair-thrashing.\n\nLush, “Rosebud” – Twenty years after their split, Miki Berenyi and Lush (one of the seminal “alternative” British bands of the 90s) have returned, going back to the roots of their dreamy guitar sound with the addition of more mature singing and songwriting.\n\nMassive Attack feat. Azekel, “Ritual Spirit” – Massive Attack has been making hypnotic, exhilarating music in collaboration with other artists for the last quarter-century, and this latest guitar-and-bass-driven song is no exception.\n\nDeclan McKenna, “Bethlehem” – Even though I wrote about how much I like this song just a few weeks ago, now that the music video has been released I thought I would include it here; if this kid is this good at age seventeen (don’t you just love that guitar tone that he uses throughout the song, especially in the chorus’s riff?), then how great will he be in a few years’ time?\n\nMinor Victories, “Scattered Ashes (Song for Richard)” – Minor Victories, a supergroup made up of members of British bands Slowdive, Mogwai, Editors and film collective Hand Held Cine Club, have made what can best be described as an uptempo elegy.\n\nPet Shop Boys, “Twenty-something” – The titans of British synthpop have returned to take millennials to task for their technological obsessions and their short attention spans, among other irritants.\n\nPrimal Scream feat. Sky Ferreira, “Where the Light Gets In” – Brilliant dance-pop in a collaboration between a classic band constantly reinventing its sound and a young singer-songwriter who is beginning to make her mark on the music world.\n\nPsychic Ills feat. Hope Sandoval, “I Don’t Mind” – Hope Sandoval, perhaps best known as lead singer of the seminal 90s dream-pop band Mazzy Star, contributes beautifully feather-light vocals to this seemingly folk/blues/country-inspired song from New York City-based band Psychic Ills; I don’t know much about the group, but I like the atmosphere of the song and how pleasantly the two singers tell us of a destructive relationship that they can’t, and on some levels don’t, want to leave.\n\nRihanna, “Kiss It Better” – Since Rihanna released her eighth album, ANTI, most of the critical focus has been on her first single, “Work”; my favorite track, however, is “Kiss It Better,” a slow jam fueled by a guitar riff played by Nuno Bettencourt (if you remember the 80s/90s band Extreme, he was their lead guitarist).\n\nSantigold, “Before the Fire” – This track has one of the best beats of the year; someone at ABC realized the same thing since the song was featured on an episode of “Quantico.”\n\nSavages, “Adore” – The highly praised London post-punk band returned this year with a slow-burning masterpiece, a melody that wraps itself around you until finally it throttles you with its intensity.\n\nSuede (aka The London Suede in the US), “I Can’t Give Her What She Wants” – On their seventh album, Night Thoughts (released in January), Brett Anderson & Co. set the bar for new music in 2016; here we have delicate baroque balladry that blooms into an even more strangely beautiful sound, louder yet still ethereal.\n\nTacocat, “Men Explain Things to Me” – Seattle pop-punk band Tacocat’s latest album, Lost Time, is full of short, to-the-point songs like this one: a tribute to all the men who try to oppress women in physical, verbal and any other ways.\n\n“Vinyl” soundtrack: Alex Newell, Jess Glynne, DJ Cassidy and Nile Rodgers, “Kill the Lights” – After reading the unfortunate news that HBO series “Vinyl” has been canceled after only one season (I was hoping that at least a few of the many complicated plot strands would be resolved next year), I listened to the show’s terrific soundtrack again and remembered the greatness of “Kill the Lights” (intended to be an “authentic” early disco track circa 1973).\n\nZayn, “Drunk” – Former One Directioner Zayn Malik impressed me with his first solo effort, Mind of Mine, the highlight being “Drunk,” a fittingly intoxicating ode to summertime lust.\n\nLegend. Directed by Brian Helgeland. I am impressed by the work put in by Tom Hardy in his double performances as identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray; the characterizations are so well done that it’s easy to appreciate the brothers as two separate creations by Hardy. The rest of Legend, however, is either so-so or outright disappointing. Guiding us through this British period piece set in the East End circa the early-to-mid-60s, Emily Browning does well as our narrator, Frances Shea (Reggie’s girlfriend, later his wife), but I constantly felt that she was holding back and that she could have had more to do; the character wasn’t completely one-dimensional, but there had to have been better dialogue or opportunities for more powerful outbursts of emotion that Browning could have been given. David Thewlis is wonderful in his scenes as the Krays’ often exasperated financial manager, and Chazz Palminteri makes the most of his small amount of screen time as American mafioso Angelo Bruno, but the rest of the cast is wasted in their too-small and/or underwritten roles. Taron Egerton (a promising young star in British cinema) has very little to do as Reggie’s boyfriend, Teddy, while Christopher Eccleston barely registers as the detective seeking to bring the brothers down (I blame the script rather than the actor, whom I’ve liked ever since his “Doctor Who” tenure) and perhaps the biggest crime of all is that Tara Fitzgerald didn’t have more scenes as Browning’s mother, a woman who knows that Reggie Kray will bring her daughter nothing but agony. With the exception of one bravura fight scene (around an hour into the film) that pits Tom Hardy against Tom Hardy, the action/drama in Legend is a letdown.\n\nThe Lobster. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. I was surprised by how crowded The Lobster’s theater was at BAM two weeks ago, even for a 7:00 pm showing on a Saturday; other BAM screenings that I have been to on the same weekday at the same time haven’t been nearly so jam-packed. Clearly The Lobster’s favorable reviews have been successful in drawing audiences in, at least in Brooklyn.\n\nConsidering the matter of the movie itself, however, I don’t know how I feel about it. I just can’t figure it out – meaning both the cinematic experience and my own opinion. Unlike the theatrical outing that immediately preceded Lobster, Mad Max: Fury Road (more on that later in this post), in which I knew very quickly that I loved the film and couldn’t wait to tell everyone, I am much more indecisive about The Lobster. I appreciate the challenges that writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos (Kinetta, Dogtooth, Alps) sets for his viewers, both for their intellects and for their gag reflexes, in telling a tale of the dystopian future as a zany comedy. The premise is fairly simple: at some unspecified point in the future, members of society have decided that the only way to be a part of normal civilization is to be in a couple, and all single people are sent to a seaside hotel where each person must find a mate within 45 days (to make the task even more daunting, the couple must share a defining trait, like having a limp or a lisp) or else the still-single person will be turned into an animal of their choosing. When we meet our protagonist, a short-sighted man named David (Colin Farrell), he has just been ejected from his marriage and home by his wife, who has taken up with another man. The Lobster spends the next two hours observing David’s attempts to find a suitable partner among his new comrades at the hotel and elsewhere, after the action has shifted to different locations.\n\nMany of the performances in the film are effective. Despite what his early appearances in big-budget, mainstream action flicks suggested, Colin Farrell has matured into a fine actor, doing great work for the past decade in smaller, more complex indie films like In Bruges (2008) and Seven Psychopaths (2012). Farrell continues to grow with his work in The Lobster, which, despite not having much memorable dialogue for him, does give him an interesting character to play. I also liked the performances by Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Léa Seydoux, Ariane Labed, Ashley Jensen, Angeliki Papoulia, Garry Mountaine and Emma Edel O’Shea. There were far too few scenes for Olivia Colman, who plays the manager of the creepy hotel; almost every one of her lines was hilarious and she has one especially wonderful scene in which she and her partner (Garry Mountaine) duet on the song “Something’s Gotten Hold of My Heart” (which I know best as a Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds cover from 1986) during a dance held at the hotel. (There is a more overt reference to the Bad Seeds later in the film when Colin Farrell sings part of Cave’s 1995 duet with Kylie Minogue, “Where the Wild Roses Grow,” while sitting on a riverbank. I don’t know if the Nick Cave connection to “Something’s Gotten Hold of My Heart” was intentional, but both songs’ lyrics mention the word “scarlet” – which is, of course, the color we associate with lobsters, albeit ones that have been cooked. Just a thought.)\n\nSo here’s the problem. For all of The Lobster’s complicated strangeness and how hard it works at being extremely bizarre, I could not translate an appreciation of the weirdness into love for the film. I respect Yorgos Lanthimos’ desire to tell a story unlike practically anything we moviegoers have seen recently (or ever), but by the time the end credits rolled, I did not feel moved or pleased by what I had seen; I merely shrugged and wondered why I didn’t feel more, which is funny since that’s how the film starts – Colin Farrell’s character can’t understand why his split from his wife has not made him cry or do anything else openly emotional. Evidently that’s just the way it goes sometimes.\n\nP.S. I recommend seeing The Lobster with a big crowd. Even if you don’t like the film, the experience is better when you’re surrounded by a lot of other people, just to hear their laughter and their uncomfortable gasps.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road. Directed by George Miller. Seen in all the glory of the Museum of the Moving Image’s wide screen and excellent sound system on May 27, a friend and I had a lovely Friday night out with Fury Road. (I really regret not seeing it in IMAX last year, but this was a top-notch alternative.) George Miller’s apocalyptic tale of a man and a group of women battling a sadistic tyrant’s dystopian civilization deserved all of the Oscar win and nominations at this year’s ceremony. Margaret Sixel’s editing is clearly an extraordinary feat of skill,, while John Seale’s cinematography, Jenny Beavan‘s costumes, the score by Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg) and the work done by the makeup team, special effects artists and sound editors/mixers further makes the film seem like an extraordinary product of technical achievements. Tom Hardy doesn’t say a lot as Max, but he does wonders with a single raised eyebrow or a low rumble in the back of his throat, and Charlize Theron is beyond awesome as Imperator Furiosa. Nicholas Hoult is also worthy of commendations, running the gamut as Nux, an impassioned young man who starts out on the dark side but eventually helps Max, Furiosa and company. Most of the film’s creepiness comes from warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the dictator against whom our heroes are fighting; it is also worth noting that with the exception of the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), I don’t think we ever hear the names of Immortan Joe’s other wives/sex slaves, who are played by Zoë Kravitz (there’s a missed opportunity: “Toast the Knowing” is so fun to say!), Riley Keough, Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. Still, the roles for women in Fury Road were miles better than anything else I can remember seeing in any other recent action movies. I wonder at what point it will start to be discussed in undergraduate and graduate film classes since there are so many aspects of Fury Road that are worth analyzing and debating.\n\nP.S. One question for those who have seen the film: how did Nux know how to drive the War Rig even though Furiosa never told him about that complicated set of instructions? Unless the setup was still in use from when Max first took over driving and therefore Nux didn’t need to change anything? I assumed that all the button-pushing needed to be done every time the motor was started. Hmmm.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. Directed by Guy Ritchie. Neither as intelligent as Snatch. (2000), as much silly fun as the first Sherlock Holmes film (2009) or as unforgivably bad as RocknRolla (2008) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), Ritchie’s reboot of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has pretty costumes designed by Joanna Johnston (most of these appealing outfits are worn by leading ladies Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki), nice locales, well-cut action scenes (thanks to editor James Herbert) but little in the way of substance. Armie Hammer does a better job than I expected as KGB envoy Illya Kuryakin, a Soviet super-spy who is paired with American agent Napoleon Solo (played by the extremely boring Henry Cavill) on a mission of international importance: working with a young German woman (Alicia Vikander) to bring down a crime syndicate headed by an Italian heiress (Elizabeth Debicki) who employs Vikander’s uncle (Sylvester Groth, a great German character actor who I last saw playing Joseph Goebbels in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds) and Vikander’s long-estranged father (Christian Berkel) in a secret nuclear-weapon-building factory. I enjoyed the sight of Debicki sinking her teeth into her villainess character and Groth’s scenes with Armie Hammer – threatening the Russian agent with Nazi-style torture – were excellent. Regrettably, there is remarkably little for Hugh Grant to do in his glorified cameo of a role as a British espionage liaison working alongside Cavill, Hammer and Vikander, and it is unfortunate that much-underrated character actor Jared Harris (playing Cavill’s CIA boss) has even less screen time than Grant. At least the disappointing action and lack of good character development are supplemented by the aforementioned visuals, a zippy, guitar-heavy score by Daniel Pemberton and the inclusion of a superb song in the end credits, Nina Simone’s 1965 recording of “Take Care of Business.”\n\nRain the Color of Blue with a Little Red in It. Directed by Christopher Kirkley. As unusual as it may seem, this film is a Nigerian update of the classic Prince film Purple Rain (1984) and it works really nicely. Similar to the source of its cinematic inspiration, we see the tale of a struggling musician yearning for acceptance from his harsh father and trying to win the love of a local woman, in addition to competing for success in face-offs against a rival performer, shown here as a vehicle for the Tuareg singer-songwriter/guitarist Mdou Moctar. (According to the director, this is the first movie ever to be made in the Tuareg language, and the odd English translation of the title is due to the fact that there is no equivalent word for “purple” in that dialect.) I had the good fortune to see the film on May 7 at Lincoln Center’s New York African Film Festival; obviously the timing of this festival screening was a sad coincidence given Prince’s passing just two weeks earlier, but perhaps because of that, the audience was extra warm towards Kirkley’s feature. It was great having both Kirkley and Mdou Moctar in person for both an introduction and a post-film Q&A (as well as sticking around afterward to talk to moviegoers in the lobby), discussing the music world in Agadez (where the story takes place) and how the narrative tries to bridge the gap between that area’s culture and Western audiences. It helps a lot that Moctar is such a naturally charismatic person, charming both on and off the screen as well as being an amazing musician. According to him, the film has opened doors for him all over the globe, and going by the music heard in the film (my favorite is “Adounia,” a title that means “Life”), that’s a great thing; Christopher Kirkley mentioned bittersweetly that he had hoped that one day Prince would be able to see the film – a dream that will not come true now – but at least Mdou Moctar will now be known to brand-new markets ready for his sound.\n\nRowland S. Howard with his collection of records and books, photographed in 1999.\n\nToday we look at a few examples of some of my favorite artists doing cover versions of other people’s songs. As Tess Duncan wrote for Paste last year: “There are some songs that you don’t truly appreciate until another artist takes it on and makes it their own. Oftentimes the newer version draws out the original’s complexities in a way you never would have noticed before. Or maybe the first version is equally compelling, but the cover artist reimagined it with such grandeur that many don’t even realize that it’s a new take on an old song. Whether converting dance bangers to melancholic ballads or pop hits to garage-rock anthems, sometimes a complete 180 is exactly what a track was missing.”\n\nCyndi Lauper, “When You Were Mine” (live at the American Music Awards, 1985 + live on tour, 2016; studio version appears on the album She’s So Unusual, 1983) [originally by Prince, 1980]. In honor of Prince’s birthday, which was on June 7, here are two examples of Cyndi Lauper covering one of my favorite songs of his, “When You Were Mine” (from the 1980 album Dirty Mind). Obviously the version from last month has a particular poignancy to it, but even back in the 80s, Cyndi had her own twist on the song that was almost as uptempo as the original while also being more bittersweet. My favorite part of both performances is that she sings the high-pitched electronic synthesizer solo heard in the recording from her debut album, She’s So Unusual.\n\nManic Street Preachers, “(Feels Like) Heaven” (live on BBC Radio 2, 6/3/2016) [originally by Fiction Factory, 1983]. It was worth sitting through all three hours of DJ Chris Evans’ hideously annoying BBC Radio 2 breakfast show (it airs 6:30-9:30 am, UK time) just to hear the Manics do a few songs from Everything Must Go (which is, as has been mentioned on this blog before, an album currently celebrating its twentieth anniversary) and also this rendition of Scottish group Fiction Factory’s one-hit-wonder single from three decades ago. Speaking of fiction, I thought I would also include a minute-long snippet from an interview with Richey Edwards and Nicky Wire from December 1991, talking about the power of literature. Looking at Edwards’ and Wire’s wonderfully gaudy fake-fur coats, I’m reminded of this quote from musician Danny McCormack: “Richey and Nicky were inseparable at one point – you’d never ever see them alone. It was like two big leopard-skin jackets walking towards you.”\n\nP.S. One of the most fun paragraphs I’ve read all week, courtesy of Wales Online writer David Owens in his review of the Manics’ recent home-turf concert at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea: “Head down and into the home straight, the forecast torrential rain finally arrived at the precise moment Nicky Wire re-emerged after his third costume change of the evening, bedecked in a Welsh flag skirt and musical note knee socks underlining his status as possessing the best pins of any fortysomething man in rock ‘n’ roll – and giving the front row quite the treat into the bargain.” (Photographic evidence here.)\n\nNick Cave & the Bad Seeds, “Something’s Gotten Hold of My Heart” (appears on the album Kicking Against the Pricks, 1986) [originally by David and Jonathan, 1967; popularized by Gene Pitney, 1967]. I did a lot of listening to Nick Cave last Thursday and Friday because of the announcement that a new Bad Seeds album, Skeleton Tree, will be out this September, in addition to the release of a partly-3D documentary about the making of the album (a one-night-only event on September 8 for which I already have my tickets, of course!). But last Saturday I was surprised and delighted to hear the song “Something’s Gotten Hold of My Heart” sung by actors Olivia Colman and Garry Mountaine in the new film The Lobster, which I saw at BAM Rose Cinemas. Even though the song is thought of as a Gene Pitney classic, I know it best from Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds’ Kicking Against the Pricks, an album comprised solely of covers. I don’t think it would be a stretch to call “Something’s…” one of Nick’s better vocals from his early years; he did a lot of atonal shouting when he fronted the Birthday Party between the late 70s and 1983, so the fact that he could do quite nicely with a good melody probably swayed people who had previously been on the fence about his musical abilities, and nowadays it serves as a good introductory tune for people who have never listened to his work at all.\n\nRowland S. Howard, “The Passenger” (appears on the soundtrack for the film He Died with a Felafel in His Hand, 2001) [originally by Iggy Pop, 1977]. It is sometimes hard not to think of Nick Cave and Rowland S. Howard being joined at the hip since the Boys Next Door/the Birthday Party was really the beginning of making music history for each of them (although to be fair, Rowland’s version of “Shivers,” done with the Young Charlatans in 1978, is still the definitive punk take on that song before Nick turned it into a moody ballad in ’79). Each man has a separate style, so it’s not like their recordings necessarily beg comparison to one another, but one thing that has always amused me in judging their oeuvres side by side is that Rowland had a knack for covering songs in a high-spirited way that Nick has never done. (I don’t expect Nick to start now, particularly with the painful year he has had, but this is an observation based on the entirety of his career with the Bad Seeds. With few exceptions, lightness is not Nick Cave’s specialty.) But Rowland could finesse a rock or pop-rock song into something just as snappy yet in his own inimitable voice, and his interpretation of one of Iggy Pop’s most famous songs is first-rate. There is a sense of humor there. You can hear an unmistakably raised eyebrow.\n\nCourtney Barnett, “New Speedway Boogie” (appears on the compilation album Day of the Dead, 2016) [originally by the Grateful Dead, 1970]. Coming back around to recently released covers, here’s a little something by Courtney Barnett, the best artist to emerge from Australia in the last couple of years (as well as being a fan of Rowland S. Howard, who influenced her guitar-playing and whose song “Shivers” she covered last year). I have never cared for the Grateful Dead, the one exception being their late 80s pop hit “Touch of Grey.” So when I listen to Courtney’s cover of “Boogie,” I hear it as new – a slow-burning but foreboding landscape – rather than as a reworking of the old, which is ideally what you want out of a successful cover anyway.\n\nCinematographer Natasha Braier with director Nicolas Winding Refn on the set of The Neon Demon, 2015.\n\nHere are many, if not all, of the films either directed by or photographed by women which will be playing in theaters in June. A number of women-directed films are also playing in theaters already: Chevalier (dir. Athina Rachel Tsangari), Eva Hesse (dir. Marcie Begleiter), Maggie’s Plan (dir. Rebecca Miller), The Meddler (dir. Lorene Scafaria), Money Monster (dir. Jodie Foster), Unlocking the Cage (dirs. Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker) and Weiner (dirs. Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg).\n\nJUNE 3: The Fits (dir. Anna Rose Holmer) – Official movie website: “THE FITS is a psychological portrait of 11-year-old Toni (Royalty Hightower)—a tomboy assimilating to a tight-knit dance team in Cincinnati’s West End. Enamored by the power and confidence of this strong community of girls, Toni eagerly absorbs routines, masters drills, and even pierces her own ears to fit in. When a mysterious outbreak of fainting spells plagues the team, Toni’s desire for acceptance is twisted.”\n\nJUNE 3: The God Cells (dir. Eric Merola) (DPs: David Barrett, Eric Merola, Kate Merola and Dave Newton) – From FAQ section of the official movie website: “Eric Merola is passionate about promising scientific innovations and discoveries that have the potential to help others. Sometimes a scientific discovery enters society that is both controversial and directly conflicts with both the currently held scientific beliefs and the profit structure of that system within the medical industry (and in the case of fetal stem cells, they conflict with widely held religious beliefs as well). Eric finds this aspect to be an important one, as the natural signal of both the economic threat coupled with a dedicated set of indoctrinated beliefs is often drowned out with confusing noise created by the system itself, as an act of self defense to preserve itself. Eric feels an obligation, through his investigative journalistic work, as well as his artistic expression as a filmmaker, to help the general public learn about these issues to help them make their own informed decisions.”\n\nJUNE 3: Gurukulam (dirs. Neil Dalal and Jillian Elizabeth) – From Village Voice review: “In their equanimous portrait of an Indian religious community, Jillian Elizabeth and Neil Dalal contemplate enlightenment through an earthly source. They capture the quiet activity of Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, an ashram in the lush hills of Tamil Nadu, with an observational documentary style that trades dispassionate distance for sympathetic immersion. With subtle shifts of perspective, the co-directors present the rural Hindu retreat as a calm, unrelenting workplace for staff members who begin work before dawn or a spiritual preparatory school–cum–summer camp for the eager, diverse disciples of Swami Dayananda Saraswati.”\n\nJUNE 3: Me Before You (dir. Thea Sharrock) – TV Over Mind review by Chris King: “Amidst the barrage of superhero sequels and big-budget action movies that are released week after week from May through August, Me Before You is a both a pleasant surprise this summer movie season. The romantic drama, based on the best-selling novel by Jojo Moyes and helmed by first-time feature director Thea Sharrock, serves not only as a nice distraction from the constant influx of Hollywood blockbusters that fill the summer months, but it also stands on its own as thoughtful, charming, and, ultimately, uplifting tale of love and life, featuring two terrific lead performances that help make up for any of the movie’s shortcomings.\n\nThe two actors delivering those fantastic performances are Game of Thrones‘ Emilia Clarke, who plays the kind and compassionate Louisa Clark, and Sam Claflin (most well-known for his role as Finnick in The Hunger Games series), who stars as the sarcastic and wistful Will Traynor. If you’ve seen a trailer for Me Before You, you know the film’s basic premise: Claflin’s Will is a quadriplegic, and Clarke’s Lou takes on the job of being his caretaker. While the pair don’t get along at first, it’s not too long before they begin to grow closer, falling in love and learning more about life from each other than they have from anyone else before.\n\n… Are some of the story beats familiar? Yes. Is everything that happens throughout the film totally realistic? Not necessarily. However, originality and reality aren’t nearly as important when you have emotional authenticity. So very few romance films nowadays care about whether their characters are believable, but at the end of Me Before You, Lou and Will felt like two real people that I got watch fall in love, whose relationship, as cheesy as it sounds, actually inspired me to ‘live boldly.’ I’d say feeling like that, even if it’s only for two hours, is worth the price of a ticket.”\n\nJUNE 3: Time to Choose (dir. Charles Ferguson) (DPs: Lula Cerri, Yuanchen Liu, Kalyanee Mam, Heloísa Passos, Lucian Read and Jerry Risius) – From official movie website: “Academy Award®-Winning documentary filmmaker Charles Ferguson (Inside Job, No End in Sight) turns his lens to address worldwide climate change challenges and solutions in his new film TIME TO CHOOSE.\n\nFeaturing narration by award-winning actor Oscar Isaac, TIME TO CHOOSE leaves audiences understanding not only what is wrong, but what can to be done to fix this global threat.\n\nFerguson explores the comprehensive scope of the climate change crisis and examines the power of solutions already available. Through interviews with world-renowned entrepreneurs, innovators, thought leaders and brave individuals living on the front lines of climate change, Ferguson takes an In-depth look at the remarkable people working to save our planet.”\n\nJUNE 3: The Witness (dir. James D. Solomon) (DP: Trish Govoni) – Reel Life with Jane review: “In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered on the street in Queens, New York by a random assailant with a knife. A newspaper story, which later led to a book by famed editor A. M. Rosenthal, contended that at least 38 of the residents in the area ignored Kitty’s screams and did not contact the police.\n\nSince that time, this story has inspired novels and has been the subject of numerous sociology lectures. The phenomenon has been considered an example of how modern society has become callous to the suffering of others. It has even been dubbed the ‘bystander effect’ and ‘Genovese syndrome.’ But is it true?\n\nA more recent article that questioned the accuracy of the original story caused Kitty’s brother, William Genovese, to want to investigate the circumstances surrounding his sister’s death. Understandably, after Kitty’s murder, his family largely turned their backs on it and didn’t want to talk about it, so he had many questions. This led to the making of the documentary, The Witness.\n\n… This multi-layered story is fascinating, heartbreaking, and filled with surprising elements. William is only able to come to a few conclusions during his investigation. One thing appears clear: Some people did indeed call the police the night of his sister’s murder, and the journalist who originally reported the story manipulated it for his own gain. It even appears that the reporter did so with the blessing of Rosenthal. This is a scathing indictment of Rosenthal’s journalistic integrity.\n\nWe watch as William seeks people who lived in the area the night his sister died, and he interviews them about what they recall. In the process, he finds out some things he never knew about his older sister – that she was a lesbian, for example. He meets with her lover, a woman who was devastated by the loss but never had a chance to meet anyone in Kitty’s family until the making of the documentary.\n\n… The Witness is a haunting documentary that has stayed with me for a number of reasons – the love of a brother for his sister, the desire of a writer to make a story even more interesting than it really was, the ways we turn away from pain, the ways we decide not to get involved in the pain of others, and the lies we tell ourselves.”\n\nJUNE 10: Call Her Applebroog (dir. and DP: Beth B) – Synopsis on Zeitgeist Films website: “This deeply personal portrait of acclaimed New York–based artist Ida Applebroog was shot with mischievous reverence by her filmmaker daughter, Beth B (Exposed). Born in the Bronx to Orthodox Jewish émigrés from Poland, Applebroog, now in her 80s, looks back at how she expressed herself through decades of drawings and paintings, as well as her private journals. With her daughter’s encouragement, she investigates the stranger that is her former self, a woman who found psychological and sexual liberation through art. As Beth B finds a deeper understanding of her mother as a human being, Applebroog shares a newfound appreciation for her own provocative work.”\n\nJUNE 10: Careful What You Wish For (dir. Elizabeth Allen) – Cinema Village synopsis: “A guy (Nick Jonas) gets more than he bargained for after entering into an affair with the wife of an investment banker. Soon, a suspicious death and substantial life insurance policy embroil him in a scandal.”\n\nJUNE 10: Germans & Jews (dir. Janina Quint) – Cinema Village synopsis: “Today, Europe’s fastest growing Jewish population is in Berlin. Germany is considered one of the most democratic societies in the world, assuming the position of moral leader of Europe as they embrace hundreds of thousands of refugees. This development couldn’t have been imagined in 1945. Through personal stories Germans & Jews explores Germany’s transformation as a society, from silence about the Holocaust to facing it head on.”\n\nJUNE 17: Bang Gang (A Modern Love Story) (dir. Eva Husson) – FrenchCulture.org synopsis: “George, a pretty teen girl, falls in love with Alex. To get his attention, she initiates a game with their friends, discovering, testing and pushing the limits of their sexuality. When the nature of their activities is revealed, each of them deals with the scandal in radically different ways. Faced with the implosion of their value systems, they move on by reassessing their priorities, finding love and their real desires.”\n\nJUNE 22: Nuts! (dir. Penny Lane) (DPs: Hallie Kohler, Penny Lane, Joseph Victorine, Angela Walley and Mark Walley) – Film Forum synopsis: “In 1917, J.R. Brinkley, a country doctor practicing in Milford, Kansas, begins treating his male patients for impotence by surgically implanting them with goat glands, a treatment that is so successful that Brinkley starts raising his own goats to meet an increasing demand. Over the years he builds the country’s 4th most powerful radio station (the better to sell his medical miracle), runs for governor of Kansas, and amasses a fortune with which he lives in sumptuous splendor. Filmmaker Penny Lane writes: ‘Like my previous feature-length film OUR NIXON, NUTS! is structured as classical tragedy with a complicated and deeply hubristic protagonist, rendered with equal parts comedy and pathos.’ NUTS! draws upon a fascinating trove of archival materials and integrates charming animated sequences that, together, bring to life a man who saw himself as more Albert Schweitzer than P.T. Barnum, but who ultimately turns out to be an unholy mix of Bernie Madoff and Donald Trump.”\n\nJUNE 24: From This Day Forward (dir. and DP: Sharon Shattuck) – IFC Center synopsis: “With her own wedding just around the corner, filmmaker Sharon Shattuck returns home to examine the mystery at the heart of her upbringing: How her transgender father Trisha and her straight-identified mother Marcia stayed together against all odds. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD is a moving portrayal of an American family coping with the most intimate of transformations.”\n\nJUNE 24: The Neon Demon (dir. Nicolas Winding Refn) (DP: Natasha Braier) – From ScreenRant article: “Nicholas Winding Refn has carved out a unique career niche for himself with eccentric, often brutally-violent and sexually-explicit fare that straddles the line between lurid exploitation and glossy arthouse fare. Best known for the slow-burn deconstructionist drama/thriller Drive (featuring Ryan Gosling as a stoic, unbalanced car expert/beatdown-specialist), he followed it up with the ultra-divisive Thailand-set crime thriller Only God Forgives (also starring Gosling).\n\nNeon Demon‘s plot has been partly kept under wraps, but it’s known to star Elle Fanning as a young woman who comes to Los Angeles to pursue a career in modeling. A previously-released plot synopsis described Fanning’s character, Jesse, as having her “youth and vitality” in danger of being ‘devoured by a group of beauty-obsessed women who will take any means necessary to get what she has.’ However, the ominously-scored trailer for the film would seem to imply that Jesse poses a danger of her own, too.”\n\nJUNE 24: Yarn (dirs. Þórdur Bragi Jónsson, Una Lorenzen and Heather Millard) (DP: Iga Mikler) – IFC Center synopsis: “Meet the artists who are redefining the tradition of knit and crochet, bringing yarn out of the house and into the world. Reinventing our relationship with this colorful tradition, YARN weaves together wool graffiti artists, circus performers, and structural designers into a visually-striking look at the women who are making a creative stance while building one of modern art’s hottest trends.”"
