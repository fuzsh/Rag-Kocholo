        "text": "Amy Lee's song \"You\" is a deeply emotional and intimate portrayal of love and devotion. The lyrics convey a sense of vulnerability and longing, as the narrator expresses their profound affection for their partner. The opening lines, \"The words have been drained from this pencil / Sweet words that I want to give you,\" suggest a struggle to articulate the depth of their feelings, highlighting the intensity of their emotions. The inability to sleep without saying goodnight further emphasizes the importance of their connection and the comfort it brings.\n\nThe song continues to explore the theme of unity and completeness in a relationship. The narrator feels perfect when they are with their partner and falls apart when they are separated. This juxtaposition underscores the significance of their bond and the sense of wholeness it provides. The line, \"All you say is sacred to me,\" indicates a deep reverence and admiration for their partner, elevating their words and presence to a near-spiritual level.\n\nAs the song progresses, the narrator's devotion becomes even more apparent. The imagery of blue eyes and whispered promises of marriage create a tender and intimate atmosphere. The declaration, \"You know you're all that I live for / You know I'd die just to hold you, stay with you,\" reveals the extent of their commitment and willingness to sacrifice for their partner. The transformation from self-doubt to self-love, as expressed in the lines, \"Now that you love me, I love myself / I never thought I would say that,\" highlights the healing power of love and its ability to bring about personal growth and self-acceptance.\n\n\"You\" is a poignant and heartfelt tribute to the transformative power of love, capturing the essence of devotion, unity, and self-discovery within a relationship."
