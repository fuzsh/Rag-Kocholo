Discrimination includes discharge and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and in general are related to the administration or enforcement of a requirement imposed under the Atomic Energy Act or the Energy Reorganization Act.\n\n(1) The protected activities include but are not limited to:\n\n(i) Providing the Commission or his or her employer information about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text of this section or possible violations of requirements imposed under either of those statutes;\n\n(ii) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text or under these requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to the employer;\n\n(iii) Requesting the Commission to institute action against his or her employer for the administration or enforcement of these requirements;\n\n(iv) Testifying in any Commission proceeding, or before Congress, or at any Federal or State proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of either of the statutes named in paragraph (a) introductory text.\n\n(v) Assisting or participating in, or is about to assist or participate in, these activities.\n\n(2) These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is actually initiated as a result of the employee assistance or participation.\n\n(3) This section has no application to any employee alleging discrimination prohibited by this section who, acting without direction from his or her employer (or the employer's agent), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.\n\n(b) Any employee who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may seek a remedy for the discharge or discrimination through an administrative proceeding in the Department of Labor. The administrative proceeding must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The employee may do this by filing a complaint alleging the violation with the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory damages.\n\n(c) A violation of paragraph (a), (e), or (f) of this section by a Commission licensee, an applicant for a Commission license, or a contractor or subcontractor of a Commission licensee or applicant may be grounds for—\n\n(1) Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.\n\n(2) Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, applicant, or a contractor or subcontractor of the licensee or applicant.\n\n(3) Other enforcement action.\n\n(d) Actions taken by an employer, or others, which adversely affect an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee has engaged in protected activities. An employee's engagement in protected activities does not automatically render him or her immune from discharge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse action dictated by nonprohibited considerations.\n\n(e)(1) Each licensee and each applicant for a license shall prominently post the revision of NRC Form 3, \"Notice to Employees,\" referenced in 10 CFR 19.11(e)(1).

As used in this section, construction means the activities in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and does not mean the activities in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(1) Activities constituting construction are the driving of piles, subsurface preparation, placement of backfill, concrete, or permanent retaining walls within an excavation, installation of foundations, or in-place assembly, erection, fabrication, or testing, which are for:\n\n(i) Safety-related structures, systems, or components (SSCs) of a facility, as defined in 10 CFR 50.2;\n\n(ii) SSCs relied upon to mitigate accidents or transients or used in plant emergency operating procedures;\n\n(iii) SSCs whose failure could prevent safety-related SSCs from fulfilling their safety-related function;\n\n(iv) SSCs whose failure could cause a reactor scram or actuation of a safety-related system;\n\n(v) SSCs necessary to comply with 10 CFR part 73;\n\n(vi) SSCs necessary to comply with 10 CFR 50.48 and criterion 3 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix A; and\n\n(vii) Onsite emergency facilities necessary to comply with either § 50.160 or § 50.47 and appendix E to this part, as applicable.\n\n(2) Construction does not include:\n\n(i) Changes for temporary use of the land for public recreational purposes;\n\n(ii) Site exploration, including necessary borings to determine foundation conditions or other preconstruction monitoring to establish background information related to the suitability of the site, the environmental impacts of construction or operation, or the protection of environmental values;\n\n(iii) Preparation of a site for construction of a facility, including clearing of the site, grading, installation of drainage, erosion and other environmental mitigation measures, and construction of temporary roads and borrow areas;\n\n(iv) Erection of fences and other access control measures;\n\n(v) Excavation;\n\n(vi) Erection of support buildings (such as, construction equipment storage sheds, warehouse and shop facilities, utilities, concrete mixing plants, docking and unloading facilities, and office buildings) for use in connection with the construction of the facility;\n\n(vii) Building of service facilities, such as paved roads, parking lots, railroad spurs, exterior utility and lighting systems, potable water systems, sanitary sewerage treatment facilities, and transmission lines;\n\n(viii) Procurement or fabrication of components or portions of the proposed facility occurring at other than the final, in-place location at the facility;\n\n(ix) Manufacture of a nuclear power reactor under a manufacturing license under subpart F of part 52 of this chapter to be installed at the proposed site and to be part of the proposed facility; or\n\n(x) With respect to production or utilization facilities, other than testing facilities and nuclear power plants, required to be licensed under Section 104.a or Section 104.c of the Act, the erection of buildings which will be used for activities other than operation of a facility and which may also be used to house a facility (e.g., the construction of a college laboratory building with space for installation of a training reactor).\n\n(b) Requirement for license. Except as provided in § 50.11 of this chapter, no person within the United States shall transfer or receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, or use any production or utilization facility except as authorized by a license issued by the Commission.\n\n(c) Requirement for construction permit, early site permit authorizing limited work authorization activities, combined license, or limited work authorization. No person may begin the construction of a production or utilization facility on a site on which the facility is to be operated until that person has been issued either a construction permit under this part, a combined license under part 52 of this chapter, an early site permit authorizing the activities under paragraph (d) of this section, or a limited work authorization under paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(d) Request for limited work authorization. (1) Any person to whom the Commission may otherwise issue either a license or permit under Sections 103, 104.b, or 185 of the Act for a facility of the type specified in §§ 50.21(b)(2), (b)(3), or 50.22 of this chapter, or a testing facility, may request a limited work authorization allowing that person to perform the driving of piles, subsurface preparation, placement of backfill, concrete, or permanent retaining walls within an excavation, installation of the foundation, including placement of concrete, any of which are for an SSC of the facility for which either a construction permit or combined license is otherwise required under paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(2) An application for a limited work authorization may be submitted as part of a complete application for a construction permit or combined license in accordance with 10 CFR 2.101(a)(1) through (a)(5), or as a partial application in accordance with 10 CFR 2.101(a)(9). An application for a limited work authorization must be submitted by an applicant for or holder of an early site permit as a complete application in accordance with 10 CFR 2.101(a)(1) through (a)(4).\n\n(3) The application must include:\n\n(i) A safety analysis report required by 10 CFR 50.34, 10 CFR 52.17 or 10 CFR 52.79 of this chapter, as applicable, a description of the activities requested to be performed, and the design and construction information otherwise required by the Commission's rules and regulations to be submitted for a construction permit or combined license, but limited to those portions of the facility that are within the scope of the limited work authorization. The safety analysis report must demonstrate that activities conducted under the limited work authorization will be conducted in compliance with the technically-relevant Commission requirements in 10 CFR Chapter I applicable to the design of those portions of the facility within the scope of the limited work authorization;\n\n(ii) An environmental report in accordance with § 51.49 of this chapter; and\n\n(iii) A plan for redress of activities performed under the limited work authorization, should limited work activities be terminated by the holder or the limited work authorization be revoked by the NRC, or upon effectiveness of the Commission's final decision denying the associated construction permit or combined license application, as applicable.\n\n(e) Issuance of limited work authorization. (1) The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation may issue a limited work authorization only after:\n\n(i) The NRC staff issues the final environmental impact statement for the limited work authorization in accordance with subpart A of part 51 of this chapter;\n\n(ii) The presiding officer makes the finding in § 51.105(c) or § 51.107(d) of this chapter, as applicable;\n\n(iii) The Director determines that the applicable standards and requirements of the Act, and the Commission’s regulations applicable to the activities to be conducted under the limited work authorization, have been met; the applicant is technically qualified to engage in the activities authorized; and issuance of the limited work authorization will provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection to public health and safety and will not be inimical to the common defense and security; and\n\n(iv) The presiding officer finds that there are no unresolved safety issues relating to the activities to be conducted under the limited work authorization that would constitute good cause for withholding the authorization.\n\n(2) Each limited work authorization will specify the activities that the holder is authorized to perform.\n\n(f) Effect of limited work authorization. Any activities undertaken under a limited work authorization are entirely at the risk of the applicant and, except as to the matters determined under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the issuance of the limited work authorization has no bearing on the issuance of a construction permit or combined license with respect to the requirements of the Act, and rules, regulations, or orders issued under the Act. The environmental impact statement for a construction permit or combined license application for which a limited work authorization was previously issued will not address, and the presiding officer will not consider, the sunk costs of the holder of limited work authorization in determining the proposed action (i.e., issuance of the construction permit or combined license).\n\n(g) Implementation of redress plan. If construction is terminated by the holder, the underlying application is withdrawn by the applicant or denied by the NRC, or the limited work authorization is revoked by the NRC, then the holder must begin implementation of the redress plan in a reasonable time. The holder must also complete the redress of the site no later than 18 months after termination of construction, revocation of the limited work authorization, or upon effectiveness of the Commission's final decision denying the associated construction permit application or the underlying combined license application, as applicable.\n\n[21 FR 355, Jan. 19, 1956, as amended at 25 FR 8712, Sept. 9, 1960; 33 FR 2381, Jan. 31, 1968; 35 FR 11460, July 7, 1970; 37 FR 5748, Mar. 21, 1972; 39 FR 14508, Apr. 24, 1974; 39 FR 26279, July 18, 1974; 39 FR 33202, Sept. 16, 1974; 43 FR 6924, Feb. 17, 1978; 49 FR 9403, Mar. 12, 1984; 72 FR 49489, Aug. 28, 2007; 72 FR 57441, Oct. 9, 2007; 84 FR 65644, Nov. 29, 2019; 88 FR 80074, Nov. 16, 2023; 89 FR 57719, Jul. 16, 2024]\n\n§ 50.11 Exceptions and exemptions from licensing requirements.\n\nNothing in this part shall be deemed to require a license for:\n\n(a) The manufacture, production, or acquisition by the Department of Defense of any utilization facility authorized pursuant to section 91 of the Act, or the use of such facility by the Department of Defense or by a person under contract with and for the account of the Department of Defense;\n\n(b) Except to the extent that Administration facilities of the types subject to licensing pursuant to section 202 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 are involved;\n\n(1)(i) The processing, fabrication or refining of special nuclear material or the separation of special nuclear material, or the separation of special nuclear material from other substances by a prime contractor of the Department under a prime contract for:\n\n(A) The performance of work for the Department at a United States government-owned or controlled site;\n\n(B) Research in, or development, manufacture, storage, testing or transportation of, atomic weapons or components thereof; or\n\n(C) The use or operation of a production or utilization facility in a United States owned vehicle or vessel; or\n\n(ii) By a prime contractor or subcontractor of the Commission or the Department under a prime contract or subcontract when the Commission determines that the exemption of the prime contractor or subcontractor is authorized by law; and that, under the terms of the contract or subcontract, there is adequate assurance that the work thereunder can be accomplished without undue risk to the public health and safety;\n\n(2)(i) The construction or operation of a production or utilization facility for the Department at a United States government-owned or controlled site, including the transportation of the production or utilization facility to or from such site and the performance of contract services during temporary interruptions of such transportation; or the construction or operation of a production or utilization facility for the Department in the performance of research in, or development, manufacture, storage, testing, or transportation of, atomic weapons or components thereof; or the use or operation of a production or utilization facility for the Department in a United States government-owned vehicle or vessel: Provided, That such activities are conducted by a prime contractor of the Department under a prime contract with the Department.\n\n(ii) The construction or operation of a production or utilization facility by a prime contractor or subcontractor of the Commission or the Department under his prime contract or subcontract when the Commission determines that the exemption of the prime contractor or subcontractor is authorized by law; and that, under the terms of the contract or subcontract, there is adequate assurance that the work thereunder can be accomplished without undue risk to the public health and safety.\n\n(c) The transportation or possession of any production or utilization facility by a common or contract carrier or warehousemen in the regular course of carriage for another or storage incident thereto.\n\n[40 FR 8788, Mar. 3, 1975, as amended at 65 FR 54950, Sept. 12, 2000]\n\n§ 50.12 Specific exemptions.\n\n(a) The Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations of this part, which are--\n\n(1) Authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security.\n\n(2) The Commission will not consider granting an exemption unless special circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever--\n\n(i) Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances conflicts with other rules or requirements of the Commission; or\n\n(ii) Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule; or\n\n(iii) Compliance would result in undue hardship or other costs that are significantly in excess of those contemplated when the regulation was adopted, or that are significantly in excess of those incurred by others similarly situated; or\n\n(iv) The exemption would result in benefit to the public health and safety that compensates for any decrease in safety that may result from the grant of the exemption; or\n\n(v) The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee or applicant has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation; or\n\n(vi) There is present any other material circumstance not considered when the regulation was adopted for which it would be in the public interest to grant an exemption.
