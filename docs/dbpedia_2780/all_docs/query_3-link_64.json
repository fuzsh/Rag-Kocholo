        "text": "Western films have been a staple of American cinema for practically as long as movies have been made.\n\nMovies in the Western genre are set in the American West, typically between the 1850s to the end of the 19th century. While it has been a stable genre — no pun intended! — it has also been the starting ground for several hybrid genres like Western comedies, Western musicals and horror Westerns.\n\nNo other genre’s history goes back quite as far as that of Westerns. According to documentarian David Gregory, “It has been estimated that up to 40 percent of all films made before 1960 were Westerns.”\n\nAlthough the category reached its greatest popularity in the early and middle decades of the 20th century, with several becoming cult classics, films continued to be made even through droughts for Westerns in the late ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s. Actors have also made their name starring in Western films, including Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, James Stewart and Jeff Bridges, to name a few.\n\nIn 2017, Bridges, the star of the Oscar-nominated genre titles True Grit and Hell or High Water, told The Hollywood Reporter, “Everything’s magnified: the struggle, the serious choices, what you do, the bravery, all those things. I like and appreciate the ambiguity of telling right from wrong,” in reference to Westerns.\n\nWhile the genre may not be what it was in the early 20th century, Westerns have continued to evolve to remain a notable category in the industry, as seen in the last decade with True Grit, Hell or High Water and Django Unchained.\n\nFind a list of the 30 most memorable Western movies of all time below.\n\n‘The Great Train Robbery’ (1903)\n\nIn one of the earliest Westerns in American cinema, the film depicts a group of outlaws who rob passengers on a train and threaten the operator.

As they make their trip across the wild west to New Mexico in the 1880s, they must face the threat of Geronimo in the area.\n\n‘Red River’ (1948)\n\nAfter working 14 years to build his cattle ranch in Texas, Tom Dunston (John Wayne) is ready to drive them to the market, which is in Missouri.
