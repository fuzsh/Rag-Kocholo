        "text": "Ten or twelve years ago, Eve Essex and I bonded over playing wind instruments. She worked at ISSUE Project Room, and after the staff finished up for the day, the two of us would jam together in the venue’s huge marble-lined theater space: Eve wailing on her saxophone, me growling and squeaking on my clarinet, a clattering drum machine keeping time. I thought those sessions sounded fantastic. Since we had no audience, you’ll have to take my word for it.\n\nNow, Eve has released two solo albums and honed her performance chops with a long list of bands and musicians, most regularly with Peter Gordon’s Love of Life Orchestra and Das Audit. Her latest record, The Fabulous Truth (Soap Library, 2024), has confirmed something I have long suspected, which is that Eve has quietly developed into one of New York’s most original songwriters. In her typically modest Midwest style, she would be the first to tell me I’m talking out of the wrong end of my clarinet when I say that. However, the fabulous truth about The Fabulous Truth is that it gleefully skips between genres: jazz, avant-garde, country, classical, pop. Its songs attempt to capture complex interior emotions and form portraits of people who have lived through extreme situations.\n\nEve spoke to me over Zoom from her residency at Crosstown Arts in Memphis, Tennessee, halfway through her summer solo tour.\n\nDan Fox I’m struck by the way you play with genre on The Fantastic Truth: heavy electronic numbers, sparse minimal compositions, an outlaw country ballad, a romantic waltz, nods to 1960s baroque pop and to jazz torch songs. Each one feels like it creates its own world in miniature.\n\nEve Essex Actually, I just played the record for my mom for the first time, and her reaction was that everything sounds the same! For something like “The Lieutenant Nun,” I was thinking about Willie Nelson and that kind of 1970s era of production and sound, which maybe crops up in small ways in other songs, even though this is the only song in that style. I’m obsessed with prog music and how that genre holds rock or electronic or classical sounds together in one place, sometimes across an album rather than all in one song. There’s certainly an element of world-building or fantasy in my record, moving through different musical eras and time periods. The genres act as a kind of transportation device.\n\nDF The songs on the new record could loosely be divided into two categories. You’ve got narrative tracks in which the lyrics tell a story from a particular perspective, such as “The Lieutenant Nun” or “Virginia Reed”; then, there are more abstract songs which evoke a psychological or emotional state of being, such as “Room with View” or “Soft Cage.” How did your writing process lead you in such divergent directions?\n\nEE I began writing the album in the winter right before the pandemic. I did a residency with the dancer Lydia Okrent, and we were meeting and improvising together. I was responding in quite an organic way while watching Lydia’s movements, and trying to create kind of a ground for her to exist in. The wind parts for “Room with View” and “Soft Cage” were recorded live at a show we did at the end of February 2020. Then, lockdown came. I found that I stopped enjoying improvising. Usually, I find improvising to be deeply therapeutic and freeing. But I actually stopped using my instruments altogether. Instead, I got into writing scores, which was something that I hadn’t really tried before. This completely changed my process of writing, which is likely reflected in the different song types on the record.\n\nDF You also started working more on your singing technique around then, too?\n\nEE That was another thing that reoriented my writing. Over FaceTime, I worked on my voice with Amirtha Kidambi, who is the bandleader of the really fantastic jazz outfit Elder Ones. When we started, I didn’t really understand how to practice singing—the tricks I had for learning woodwinds weren’t translating when working on my own, despite lots of overlap in terms of breath control. Digging into technique helped to expand my range, in the literal sense of more notes up and down; it put me in a mindset of exploring new styles and delivery. Once I felt comfortable centering my voice, I made an explicit decision to try approaching a few songs lyrics-first, taking on a songwriter’s mindset rather than a producer/composer’s. Around that time, I found a copy of Steven Sondheim’s book Finishing the Hat (2010) on the street. It’s basically line-by-line footnotes for his songs describing specific word choices, and it’s also a hyper-critical take on everything wrong with them. His intensely formal approach to structure gave me some new entry points to writing lyrics, something that usually doesn’t feel that immediate for me.\n\nDF What attracted you to the stories you tell on the album’s narrative songs? There’s the extraordinary Antonio or Catalina de Erauso, the subject of “The Lieutenant Nun.” De Erauso ran away from a convent, lived as a man, was a soldier, a smuggler, and a fugitive.\n\nEE “The Lieutenant Nun” was based on a book that I had been carrying around for years. I felt attracted to de Erauso as an extreme character who lived many different lives wandering the world: nun, ruthless colonial soldier, sheep herder. The writing style, quite different from anything contemporary, completely focuses on the events in their life with very little internal reflection. I found them a mysterious, bombastic, and pretty unreliable narrator.\n\nDF Then there’s “Virginia Reed,” about a young girl who survived the Donner Party.\n\nEE I got to know about Virginia Reed when I visited the Donner Memorial museum in Truckee, California, which is one of those wonderful almost homemade local museums you find dotted around the country. I picked up a book of letters there, which I found striking because it’s written by a thirteen-year-old, someone whose language is quite innocent in certain ways but doesn’t quite mask the horror of what she’s witnessing. When she writes, “My brother got very skinny,” or similarly simple words to that effect, you can feel the darkness and her seriousness in acknowledging it coming off the page. Something that does not make it into the song, but which I was taken by, was that it was mostly written phonetically too.\n\nDF “Honeypot,” the album’s powerful emotional closer, is a torch song about a ransomware hacker. This may sound like a dumb question, but does that come from your day job as a computer programmer?\n\nEE Probably! I’ve been inundated with information and training about password safety, phishing, and so on. Which got me thinking about the question: How you know if somebody is real or not? I’m generally interested in privacy, data, and how traces of our persona and behavior are consumed online. I think about how access is allowed in digital or psychological spaces, and how outside actors could ensnare and totally reconstruct you from the traces that you unwittingly leave strewn about the Internet.\n\nDF You’ve played solo, with small units such as Das Audit, and with big ensembles like Peter Gordon’s Love of Life Orchestra—\n\nEE I was playing in orchestras as a kid, too, an incredible experience I miss.\n\nDF Of course, you’re a highly trained musician!\n\nEE I mean, up to a point! I did drop out of school after one year.\n\nDF Okay, a highly trained dropout!\n\nEE It’s true that I really like playing with other people. Varieties of scale activate different parts of how you perform and think about your role. In a big group like The Love of Life Orchestra, I’m never a lead voice. Within a section, my job is about texture, blending with the other horn players, and emphasizing the soloist. In a lot of smaller group stuff, I often end up playing as a melodic lead, maybe partly because there are never enough horn players to truly make a horn section. It often involves formulating melodies on the spot and trying to see how they disseminate through the group. Working along a range of scales keeps me thinking about where my voice fits into the mix.\n\nDF I think that it would be healthy if all artists, in all disciplines, had the experience of being both the soloist and a supporting voice. Music and the performing arts have more scope for doing that than, say, being a novelist alone at your desk. But it would do a lot of artists good to be “one of the band” instead of the author, using their skills to support someone else’s work.\n\nEE In a situation where you don’t have to be the author, you can be the performer. It doesn’t always have to be your voice. There’s joy in seeing how contributing to other people’s projects can transform what you previously understood about your own sound. I’m also trying to develop an understanding of what my own writing could be if I took myself out of the center as a performer.\n\nDF Does your first album, Here Appear (2018), seem like ancient history to you?\n\nEE It does seem like a different world. That’s largely to do with the process of putting it together. With this new one, the mixing and mastering took lots of care and revision—part of that is the nature of doing stuff for a bigger band, with lots of pieces to juggle. My first album was more like a live record. I just went into the studio, basically ran my live set, and the engineer mixed it. That was kind of it.\n\nDF Like Elvis going into Sun Studio in Memphis and knocking out a song in ten minutes.\n\nEE I just went to visit Sun Studio! They made a show of pointing out the spot that he stood. With my first album I wasn’t very opinionated about how my songs should sound as recordings. At that point, I thought of myself as a live artist. Because I was improvising everything and using live looping, each song was different every time I was doing it. Now, there is a defined structure. The harmonic and rhythmic complexity of my songs has totally shifted since I started planning and writing pieces that are constructed in a studio. Production is at the front of my mind. Figuring out how to perform it comes later.\n\nDF If money and resources were no object, where would you like to go next, musically?\n\nEE As I’m sitting here in Memphis, I’ve been dreaming about coming back to record with one of the incredible session house bands here, like the Royal Studios Band, who played with Al Green and are still working out of that studio. But my hope for the medium-term is to figure out consistent instrumentation for the unit of The Fabulous Truth and get some material written specifically for those players. If I’m fantasizing about big buckets of money, let’s expand The Fabulous Truth seven-piece by adding full horn and string sections, backup singers, many synthesizers, and a pipe organ. Make it truly epic!"
