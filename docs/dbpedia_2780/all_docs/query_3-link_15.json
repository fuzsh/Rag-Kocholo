        "text": "Writing a definitive list of the best comedy films ever made is hard. Not only has the genre been around since the late 1800s, but there are many types of comedy movies: rom-coms, screwballs, slapsticks. But sometimes, you just need a good laugh. So, what makes something a “best comedy movie?” The easy answer is that it has to be funny. However, it’s more than that. Great comedy movies stand the test of time. Comedy, as a genre, has a reputation for aging poorly to the point that many critics ask, can comedy age well? Many comedies pull off this feat and become classics. These classics come with endlessly quotable lines, iconic scenes, and jokes that we want to watch again and again.\n\nFunniest Movies (25-11)\n\nComedy is subjective, but some movies are just funny … full stop. A great comedy can be rewatched, quoted and revisited. While you won’t find the highest-grossing comedy movie on this list (it’s 2023’s Barbie, if you are wondering,) you will find box office titans and even a couple of commercial flops that achieved cult status after the fact.\n\nThis full list includes films from the 1930s to 2010s, and directors such as Mel Brooks, Adam McKay, John Huges and Stanely Kubrick. While complying a best comedies list, it is essential to look at subgenres. Comedies on this list include satires, mockumentaries, dark humor, rom-coms, teen comedies and even a musical comedy. There are so many types of comedy; all can be done well in the right hands.\n\n25. My Cousin Vinny (1992)\n\nThis film taught an entire generation about the features of the Chevy Bel Air. The whole movie is exceptionally quotable and has a devoted fan base, partially thanks to the powerhouse performances of Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei. Tomei’s performance even earned her an Oscar nom for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nWhile the film only garnered 2.5 stars from Roger Ebert in 1992, the movie now boasts an 87% on Rotten Tomatoes from both fans and critics. The story follows an inexperienced lawyer, the titular Vinny, as he tries to free two Brooklyn college students falsely accused of murder in Alabama. The film became a classic through DVD and VHS rentals, which almost adds to the perfect 1990s nature of this now classic comedy. Currently, My Cousin Vinny is available to rent on Amazon Prime, Youtube, Apple TV and Google Play… if you can’t find a Blockbuster.\n\n24. Step Brothers (2008)\n\nThe bro-comedy dominated the 2000s. While Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler flicks grounded this subgenre in the mid-2000s, buddy comedies are nothing new and have been popular with audiences since names like Laurel and Hardy were on marquees. Step Brothers feels like a classic buddy comedy.\n\nIn the film, directed by Adam McKay, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play adult step-brothers forced to live together as their aging parents remarry. The wackiness of the premise is part of what makes Step Brothers a laugh-out-loud comedy. The film received mixed reviews on its initial run but has garnered a cult classic status in subsequent years. A lot of that status has to do with the powerhouse performances that this movie boasts, not only from the leads but also Richard Jenkins, who plays Reilly’s father. It is currently streaming for free on the Roku Channel.\n\n23. The Big Sick (2017)\n\nThe Big Sick is a rom-com, a com-com and a profoundly human film. The BFI credited the movie for refreshing the rom-com genre. The film stars Kumail Nanjiani and Zoe Kazan and was directed by Michael Showalter.\n\nThe semi-autobiographical film follows the early romance between Nanjiani and his wife, Emily V. Gordon, as she battles adult-onset Still’s Disease. Gordon and Nanjiani wrote the screenplay together. While the movie received good reviews, it also drew criticism for its depiction of Desi women. Something that Nanjiani has since apologized for. The film is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\n22. The Addams Family (1991)\n\nMany family comedies are created based on existing intellectual property, and many fail to capture the feeling of the source material while still standing on their own as a film. The Addams Family impressively does both. Based on the comics and TV show of the same name, The Addams Family does cartoonish well.\n\nThis film is remembered for its powerhouse performances from the late Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, Christina Ricci and Christopher Lloyd. The story follows the Addams Family as a conman infiltrates their house, posing as patriarch Gomez Addams’ long-lost brother Fester. The film walks the line between dark, sexy, goofy and silly. The New York Times said of the movie in 1991, “Making his directorial debut, the excellent cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld … gives the film a visual wit to match its screenplay's ghoulish gags.” The film is currently streaming on Netflix, AMC+ and Paramount+.\n\n21. Best In Show (2000)\n\nThere aren’t many true auteur comedy filmmakers, but Christopher Guest is one of them. His movies have a definite style with their often mockumentary approach, purposeful awkwardness, familiar casts, and notably improvisational style. Improv is hard to pull off, but Best In Show does it well.\n\nBest In Show follows five dogs and their people competing in a Philadelphia dog show. The ensemble cast includes Eugene Levy, Catherine O’Hara, Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge and many others. Best In Show is currently available for purchase to stream on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV and YouTube.\n\n20. Singing In The Rain (1952)\n\nMusical comedies sometimes aren’t regarded as “real comedies” as they have to walk the line between two genres. However, Gene Kelly and Stanely Donen’s Singing In The Rain excels at both. The movie stars Kelly, Donald O’Connor and Debbie Reynolds and follows actors as Hollywood moved from silent films to “talkies.”\n\nThe AFI ranked the movie highly on its list of best films. O’Connor received a Golden Globe for his work on the film, and the film received a WGA award as well. The movie fulfills on the promise to “make ‘em laugh” but also features breathtaking dance sequences from Kelley and Cyd Charisse. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n19. The Birdcage (1996)\n\nThe Birdcage both feels dated and extremely timely. Based on the French film and play, La Cage Aux Folles, The Birdcage stars Robin Williams and Nathan Lane as gay parents who own a South Beach Drag club. They are forced to play it straight when William’s son brings home the daughter of a far-right senator.\n\nThe film broke boundaries when it came to gay representation but, unfortunately, features a prominent character in brownface. Hank Azaria plays a gay Guatemalan housemaid. While Azaria has apologized for other instances of brownface, including voicing Apu on The Simpsons after the release of the documentary The Problem with Apu, he has not reflected on his role in The Birdcage. While the film isn’t perfect, The Birdcage shows not only queer parenting but the importance of standing up to right-wing politics to the queer community, making it important in the history of queer cinema. It is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n18. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986)\n\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off is more than just quotable; it has been part of several generations’ teen experiences. And that makes sense because \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" Director John Hughes captures something magic in the idealized day off.\n\nThe film follows the titular Ferris (Matthew Brodrick), his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), as they skip school to explore Chicago. The film sits at a 92% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and is currently available for streaming through a subscription to Paramount+ or on Pluto TV.\n\n17. Polyester (1981)\n\nThere are dirty comedies, and then there are John Waters movies. While some of his more well-known films have a weight to them, Polyester is lighter and more comedic. Longtime collaborator Divine shines as a housewife with a great sense of smell and an unfaithful husband. She is then wooed by Tab Hunter’s Todd Tomorrow.\n\nPolyester oscillates between goofy, melodramatic and disgusting. The film was released in “Odorama,” a scratch-and-sniff card that encouraged moviegoers to smell ten odors from the movie. It was intentionally ridiculous and fed into the pulp nature of the film. While reminiscent of the 1960s Smell-O-Vision and AromaRama, Odorama encouraged moviegoers to smell things like dirty shoes and skunk. The film is currently on Amazon Prime, though you will have to find a special screening to get your hands on an Odorama card.\n\n16. Napoleon Dynamite (2004)\n\nNapoleon Dynamite is hard to describe, but it took America by storm upon its release. While it garnered mixed to even poor reviews, such as 1.5 stars from Ebert, it persisted as a cultural phenomenon. It has even been chosen to be rescreened at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe film, directed by Jared Hess and starring John Heder, tells a coming-of-age story of an awkward teenager in small-town Idaho. The film was made on a shoestring budget and without many established actors, but that is part of the charm of Napoleon Dynamite. The film has almost a cinema verité quality as it captures the realness of teenage life. Napoleon Dynamite is currently streaming on Max.\n\n15. How to Marry a Millionaire (1953)\n\nThis screwball comedy stars Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall as O.G. gold diggers. The performances in How to Marry a Millionaire are what really cement it as a classic. Monroe shows off the sharpness in her comedy and persona, while Bacall balances raw sex appeal and comic timing.\n\nWhile How to Marry a Millionaire is late for a screwball comedy as a genre, it still isn’t afraid to relish in some of its zanier moments, like how Monroe blindly stumbles as she refuses to wear her glasses because “men are not attentive to girls who wear glasses.” It is available to rent through YouTube, Apple TV, Amazon Prime and Google Play.\n\n14. Little Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nWhile many movies attempt the difficult “tragicomedy” genre, Little Miss Sunshine excels in it. The film follows an impoverished, dysfunctional family as they road trip to a children’s beauty pageant with their young daughter.\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine features iconic performances from all of its principal cast: Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin. The film premiered at Sundance and started a small distribution bidding war. It went on to be nominated for 4 Academy Awards (and won 2.) The film holds a 91% amongst audiences and critics on Rotten Tomatoes and is currently streaming on Hulu.\n\n13. Clueless (1995)\n\nTeen comedies sometimes get a bad rap. However, some names stand out in the genre of teen comedies based on classic literature: 10 Things I Hate About You, She’s the Man and, of course, Clueless.\n\nLoosely based on Jane Austen’s Emma, Clueless is endlessly quotable from “As if.” to “You’re a virgin who can’t drive.” to “Oh my god. I am totally bugging.” The movie, directed by Amy Heckerling, stars Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy and Paul Rudd. In 1995, The Washington Post praised the film for the “precision of its observations and sharpness of its one-liners.” And over 20 years later, it still packs the same punch. It is currently available to stream on Paramount+ or on Pluto TV.\n\n12. It Happened One Night (1934)\n\nFew comedies have won Best Picture, and It Happened One Night did much more than that. The film was the first to win Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Directed by Frank Capra and starring Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, It Happened One Night is a pure old Hollywood classic.\n\nThe story follows a newspaperman as he tries to help a young heiress connect with her scheming fiance. Yes, the plot feels very 1930s at times, but the influence of this film on the modern rom-com is undeniable. You can almost see tropes develop in real time watching it. While the enemies-to-lovers trope can be seen everywhere, from Pride and Prejudice to a Hallmark Christmas movie, It Happened One Night gets it right and pairs it with snappy writing that holds up 90 years later. The film is currently available for free on YouTube and is a must-watch for any rom-com lover. It is currently streaming for free on YouTube and Tubi.\n\n11. This is Spinal Tap (1984)\n\nRob Reiner’s directorial debut, This is Spinal Tap, really goes up to 11. This rock mockumentary has a huge cult following and for a good reason. The Criterion Collection has called it in “the ranks of the greatest comedies ever made.” The film stars Christopher Guest and Michael McKean as aging rockers on their American comeback tour.\n\nPart of what makes This is Spinal Tap great is the music. The parody songs in this movie are both funny and earworms. The New York Times said, “There's an in-joke quality to the film, one that will make it all the more hilarious to anyone at all knowledgeable about either the esthetic or the business aspects of pop music. However, you need not have heard a band like Spinal Tap to find its story highly amusing.” It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n10 Best Comedies Of All Time\n\nThe top ten movies on this list aren’t only great comedies. They are films that have influenced the genre. Even people who have never seen these films know a joke from them or have seen a movie that takes direct inspiration from them.\n\nRanking these movies comes down to splitting hairs. They all deliver laughs, contain iconic lines and scenes, and, maybe more importantly, are endlessly rewatchable. These films feel not only witty but often inventive. While later movies have ripped off these films, they still feel fresh, often many years later (the oldest in this section is from 1941.)\n\n10. Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nIt’s rare that self-professed chick flicks get nominated for the Oscars. Bridesmaids earned two nominations for Best Supporting Actress Melissa McCarthy and Best Original Screenplay for Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo. Directed by Paul Feig, Bridesmaids boasts several comedy powerhouse performances from Wiig, McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Jon Hamm and Wendi McLendon-Covey.\n\nThe film follows Wiig’s Annie as she becomes the maid of honor for Rudolph’s Lillian. Bridesmaids certainly wasn’t the first all-female lead comedy. Still, it has been noted as an important film in the genre of female-lead mainstream comedies, which some have called “the Bridesmaids effect.” Outside of its influence, it's just a hilarious movie from “Help me, I’m poor” to “I did slightly overcommit to the whole dog thing.” The movie is currently streaming on Peacock.\n\n9. Office Space (1999)\n\nBefore The Office became a millennial favorite, there was Office Space. Directed by Mike Judge and starring Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston, Office Space walks the line between cult comedy and cultural juggernaut.\n\nThe film captures the humdrum of 90s office life while still being hilariously wacky as a group of underappreciated office workers try to take down their greedy boss. Ebert said of the film, \"’Office Space’ is a comic cry of rage against the nightmare of modern office life. It has many of the same complaints as ‘Dilbert’ and the movie ‘Clockwatchers’ and, for that matter, the works of Kafka and the Book of Job.” Office Space is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n8. Airplane! (1980)\n\nAirplane! is one of those movies that everyone has surely heard a quote from … “and don't call me Shirley.” Starring Leslie Nielson, this farce parodies the disaster film, specifically Zero Hour (1953).\n\nThe film earned the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy and nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and for the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay. While not all parts of the movie have aged well, especially regarding race, it’s still remembered as a comedy classic for its goofy approach to parody. It is currently streaming on Showtime.\n\n7. Sullivan’s Travels (1941)\n\nThis 1941 Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake comedy is often called a “masterpiece.” It has been added to the Library of Congress, with the review, “Preston Sturges’s ‘Sullivan’s Travels’ remains one of the great American film satires of Hollywood.”\n\nThe titular Sullivan is a Hollywood director known for light comedies. He decides it's time to make something more important and ventures out into the real world, looking for inspiration for his film, “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” a film about suffering. While the film has a definite heart and message, dialogue and jokes come fast in this movie. Sullivan’s Travels is a must-watch for classic movie and comedy fans alike. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n6. Coming to America (1988)\n\n“But where in New York can one find a woman with grace, elegance, taste and culture? A woman suitable for a king … Queens.” Coming to America is full of iconic lines. Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall and James Earl Jones shine in this classic directed by John Landis.\n\nComing To America captures something real about the 1980s, Queens and the immigrant experience while still being a wacky comedy about an African prince coming to New York to find a wife. While many reviews weren’t glowing in 1988, Coming To America has remained popular, even prompting a sequel, Coming 2 America, in 2021. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n5. The Jerk (1979)\n\nThe Jerk is directed by Carl Reiner and is Steve Martin’s first starring role. While not every joke has stood the test of time, The Jerk still delivers solid laughs over 40 years later, often thanks to Martin’s impeccable comedic timing.\n\nThe Jerk follows Martin’s character Navin through his rise to riches, and his subsequent fall. While the film is often crass and possibly even dumb on purpose, many jokes have a wit and elevation that balances the comedy. The film is often found on lists of best comedies and was even a favorite of director Stanley Kubrick. It is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n\n4. Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail is the second film by the iconic British comedy troupe Monty Python. This movie is so quotable that it has almost transcended the original script to seep into the collective consciousness. Who doesn’t say to themselves, “Tis but a scratch” occasionally?\n\nThis movie stars Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin and is a parody of Arthurian times. The film follows Chappan’s King Arthur as he and his squire search for the Holy Grail. While it received mixed reviews on its initial release, its cult following and memory are impressive. A musical based on the film, Spamalot, was adapted for the stage in 2005 and was revived for Broadway in 2023. Currently, the movie is available to stream on Netflix.\n\n3. Friday (1995)\n\nNot much happens in the movie Friday, but it doesn’t matter. The film still packs in the laughs. F. Gary Gray directs with iconic performances from Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. This movie is endlessly quotable from “Damnnnn!” to “Bye Felicia.” and has reached almost a meme status through reaction gifs.\n\nFriday inspired two sequels: Next Friday and Friday After Next. All three movies have garnered cult status. However, Friday was both commercially successful and praised in 1995. The film had a modest budget, a music video director, one lead who had never done a comedy and only 20 days to shoot, but against it all, the film is remembered as a comedy classic. It is currently available on Max and Tubi.\n\n2. Dr Strangelove (1964)\n\nDr Strangelove is maybe the darkest comedy on this list, but when you are making a satire featuring nazi scientists and nuclear annihilation, that tends to happen. This film was directed by Stanely Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers in three roles: a British officer, the American President, and the titular doctor, a former nazi and nuclear war expert.\n\nThe film follows a situation where an American general plans to drop a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union. We promise it’s funnier than it sounds. The film is a frequent addition not only to best comedy lists but also to film lists in general, including AFI’s Best American Films list. It is currently free to watch on YouTube.\n\n1. Young Frankenstein (1974)\n\nNo list of best comedies is complete without Mel Brooks. If this list had more space, it could have easily included several Brooks films, including Blazing Saddles, History of the World Part 1., and The Producers. There is a reason why so many of his movies have become comedy classics.\n\nYoung Frankenstein mixes comedy, horror and parody perfectly. The film features iconic performances, especially from Gene Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay with Brooks. The movie parodies the story of Frankenstein but does it with both zaniness and wit. Young Frankenstein currently boasts a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available to stream through a DirecTV subscription.\n\nBottom Line\n\nComedy is subjective, but genuinely great comedies can connect to broad audiences and remain funny watch after watch, year after year. From modern classics to familiar faves, you can’t go wrong with the comedies on this list."
