        "text": "The Gen X experience\n\nMembers of Generation X, or Gen Xers, grew up in a time when there were more dual-income families, single-parent households, and children of divorce than when boomers were growing up. Consequently, many Gen Xers were latchkey kids, returning from school to an empty home while their parents were still away at work. Gen Xers were the first generation to grow up with personal computers to some extent, thus becoming tech savvy. They were the first generation to grow up with cable television widely available. MTV, the cable television network that initially broadcast music videos 24 hours a day, was rolled out in 1981 and was embraced by so many Gen Xers that MTV Generation also has been used to describe the Generation X cohort.\n\nGen Xers came of age during the emergence of the deadly AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, which gave a new urgency to the notion of “safe sex” practices. They saw a changing world order, having lived through the end of the Cold War with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. They witnessed the technological marvel of the first successful space shuttle flight in 1981 as well as the tragic explosion of the space shuttle Challenger five years later. Gen Xers lived during the height of the U.S. government’s War on Drugs, being exhorted to “just say no” to illegal drug use. They also lived through the energy crises in the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nGen Xers experienced shaky economic times as children and young adults, enduring the recessions of the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, and would continue to be impacted by economic tumult throughout their adult lives. College tuition rates began to soar in the early 1980s, saddling Generation X with more student loan debt than previous generations, which would take its members many years—for some, decades—to pay off. Some entered the workforce during or after a recession. Subsequently, many Gen Xers were unemployed, or underemployed, and the number of Gen Xers who as adults had to move back home to live with their parents gave rise to the “boomerang kids” moniker. (These trends would continue and accelerate with the millennial generation.) Partly because of these factors, Gen Xers were sometimes described as slackers or whiners, particularly in the 1990s, although those descriptions have been contested. In the following decades, the economic fallout from the Great Recession (2007–09) and the COVID-19 pandemic would affect all living generations, but Gen Xers saw a more significant setback to their retirement funds than others. On the whole, Generation X was likely to be the first generation whose members would not be more financially well-off than their parents were.\n\nCharacteristics of Gen Xers\n\nGen Xers are typically described as being resourceful and independent—traits partly stemming from their latchkey childhoods—as well as keen on maintaining work-life balance, perhaps due to witnessing the demands of their parents’ work and subsequent absence from family life. They are often described as being cynical, attributed to the economic and societal tumult they experienced as children and young adults.\n\nAs compared with previous generations, members of Generation X are more ethnically diverse, with some one-third of Gen Xers identifying as nonwhite; are somewhat less likely to be involved in organized religion; and tend to be more liberal on social issues, such as same-sex marriage. However, this open-mindedness did not necessarily translate into a more traditionally liberal political identification: a 2022 Gallup poll showed that 27 percent of Gen Xers identified as Democrats, while 30 percent identified as Republicans. More Gen Xers—44 percent—chose to identify as independent, which was a higher percentage than in previous generations."
