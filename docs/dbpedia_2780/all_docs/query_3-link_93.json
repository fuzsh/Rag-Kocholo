        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – Few things can give you the kind of rush you feel at the arrival of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe excitement of the build-up. The potential payoff. The rush to get tickets. It’s something fans have been embracing since the 1970s and has inspired some of the most creative popcorn films of all time.\n\nOur list of the “Greatest Summer Popcorn Movies” ranks the films based on popcorn value – a combination of box office, quality and overall entertainment value.\n\nGet ready for sequels, action movie catchphrases, sharks, dinosaurs, wars in outer space and a whole lot more.\n\n100. Armageddon (1998)\n\nDuring the boom of movies about meteors potentially spelling the end of Earth, “Armageddon” just went bigger and more emo than every other film, scoring a No.1 hit for Aerosmith and making us all tear up when Bruce Willis sacrifices himself for Ben Affleck.\n\n99. Ghostbusters II (1989)\n\nThe sequel to “Ghostbusters” sticks to the style and format of the original, almost to a fault. Though, fans didn’t seem to mind. “Ghostbusters II” still featured tons of humor and brought in over $215 million.\n\n98. The Nutty Professor (1996)\n\nAfter scoring big in the 1980s, Eddie Murphy finally found his hit vehicle for a new decade with a remake of “The Nutty Professor,” thanks to a well-crafted fat suit.\n\n97. Edge of Tomorrow (2014)\n\nEven Tom Cruise haters had to find Edge of Tomorrow intriguing with its amazing special effects and plot about a future society in which Cruise’s character has to keep repeating the same day alongside Emily Blunt (which actually doesn’t sound all that bad).\n\n96. Straight Outta Compton (2015)\n\nAn R-rated film about the reaction of N.W.A. didn’t seem like a film that would make $200 million at the box office. But F. Gary Gray and the film’s crop of young talent give the movie a mainstream appeal that fans were drawn to.\n\n95. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n\nThanks to the brilliance of “The Dark Knight,” “The Dark Knight Rises” became a pop culture event in 2012. It wasn’t as good as its predecessor, but still served a pretty damn good conclusion to Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\n94. National Lampoon’s Animal House (1978)\n\nFeaturing a cast led by the hilarious John Belushi,” the comedy classic “Animal House” reached box office gold, flipping a $3 million budget into one of the biggest comedies of all time up until that point.\n\n93. World War Z (2013)\n\nThe behind the scenes drama that nearly prevented “World War Z” form happening was almost as enticing as the film itself. Somehow, Paramount Pictures was able to pull things together, giving fans an excellent zombie movie with Brad Pitt at the forefront that demands sequels.\n\n92. Tropic Thunder (2008)\n\nAn action comedy that serves as the ultimate parody of Hollywood action films and the stars behind them earned Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination and proved Tom Cruise was far from washed up.\n\n91. Transformers (2007)\n\n“Transformers” is the ultimate Michael Bay movie franchise in all its style over substance glory. But of all the franchise’s efforts, it the first movie, which had been anticipated for quite some time, that has the most heart. Plus, a $700 million global box office sets a very nice tone.\n\n90. Risky Business (1983)\n\nIn 1983, Paul Brickman crafted a romantic dramedy with depth sex appeal that would make a star out its leading man – Tom Cruise.\n\n89. Spider-Man (2002)\n\nIn 2002, a film starring Marvel Comics’ most popular hero finally hit the big screen and it didn’t disappoint. Its sequel would prove better, but Sam Raimi and Spider-Man set the standard for Spidey flicks moving forward.\n\n88. The Mummy Returns (2001)\n\nThe first Mummy film was solid enough. But Universal Pictures turned things up a notch (or 12) for the sequel, adding more special effects and popular wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to the mix. Fans flocked to theaters, pushing the moving to a $24 million opening day.\n\n87. Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)\n\nIt’s the movie that gave us Hollywood’s ultimate romance (at least until recently) and it’s easy to see why. The chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt radiates from the screen in “Mr. & Mrs. Smith.”\n\n86. WarGames (1983)\n\n“WarGames” developed quite the following after its initial release. But it already had a lot of fans to begin with. The film, about a computer that nearly starts World War III, was the little movie that could of 1983.\n\n85. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)\n\nBefore the age of CGI, several films were accomplishing amazing things with practical effects. Case in point: “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,” which made its set pieces big enough to make the actors look like they’d been shrunken. The concept intrigued fans who helped it open strong just behind “Batman” in June 1989.\n\n84. Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)\n\nJust the fact that some people argue whether or not “Lethal Weapon 2” is better than the original shows the sequel has a lot going for it. The first film was the ultimate buddy cop action movie and led to great anticipation for “Lethal Weapon 2” and the future sequels that would come.\n\n83. X-Men: First Class\n\n“X-Men: First Class” was a huge risk that threated to derail a lucrative franchise, especially without Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine as an integral part. But “First Class” paid off and 20th Century Fox had a new set of characters (some younger versions of those that had already been introduced) to make money off of.\n\n82. Air Force One (1997)\n\nThe plot for “Air Force One” is utterly ridiculous (terrorists posing as cameramen to get on POTUS’ plane?). But it makes for one hell of an action movie where Harrison Ford plays the bravest President we’ve ever seen.\n\n81. Ratatouille (2007)\n\nArguably, the most underappreciated of all the Pixar movies. “Ratatouille” is one of the best animated films of the 21st Century. How “Cars” got two sequels and “Ratatouille” hasn’t had one is beyond me.\n\n80. Girls Trip (2017)\n\nThe surprise hit of 2017. “Girls Trip” appealed to two underrepresented demographics – women and African Americans – who love going to the movies, while making a star out of Tiffany Haddish.\n\n79. Mission: Impossible (1996)\n\nBased on the classic television series of the same name, 1996’s “Mission: Impossible” gets just about everything right when it comes to a good spy thriller and kick started yet another epic run at the box office for Tom Cruise.\n\n78. Total Recall (1990)\n\nAt the time, “Total Recall” carrying one of the biggest price tags in movie history. But the payoff was big, appealing to action junkies and science fiction geeks.\n\n77. Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nFans flocked to what they thought was the final film in the “Star Wars” saga. “Return of the Jedi” is quite the celebration, even if it’s not a great film. Maybe it was the plot or the sudden death of Boba Fett. No, it was definitely the Ewoks.\n\n76. Captain America: Civil War (2014)\n\n“Captain America: Civil War” lacks a dynamic villain. But you don’t really mind when you get to the Avengers facing off against each other. The final fight scene between Captain America and Iron Man is something to marvel at.\n\n75. Wanted (2008)\n\nBorrowing heavily from the Gun Fu genre of films, “Wanted” was a kind of mainstream film many movie goers hasn’t seen before. The action was intense with leading lady Angelina Jolie at the story’s center.\n\n74. War of the Worlds (2005)\n\n“War of the Worlds” builds a suspenseful and rewarding story of aliens taking over Earth with winning performances from everyone involved. The only thing that keeps it from moving higher up this list is that lame ending.\n\n73. Jurassic World (2015)\n\n“Jurassic World” doesn’t really break new ground, recycling much of the plot from the first “Jurassic Park.” But it chose the right parts to copy, earning what was the biggest opening weekend in movie history.\n\n72. District 9 (2009)\n\n“District 9” digs deeper than just about any other Alien movie you’ll find, focusing on elements of xenophobia and racism at the core of its story.\n\n71. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)\n\nNot every “Harry Potter” filmed opened during the summer. So, you’ll only find a few on this list. The franchise as a whole hits its stride with this third installment, thanks to director Alfonso Cuaron’s direction and a story that’s darker both in theme and look.\n\n70. Trainwreck (2015)\n\nAmy Schumer wrote a great script for “Trainwreck” and handed it to Judd Apatow. Little did she know they’d ask her to star in the movie. It turned the standup comedian into a movie star. And look out for the great cameo by LeBron James.\n\n69. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\n“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” isn’t just a visual wonder. It packs emotional power that felt like epic theater.\n\n68. The Conjuring (2013)\n\n“The Conjuring” used old-school ghost storytelling to become a surprise hit in 2013, setting up sequels and spinoff films that followed.\n\n67. Up (2009)\n\nIf “Up” had ended after its first 10 minutes, it would still be Pixar’s most emotionally moving film. As it turns out, we get to watch Carl Fredricksen find a new appreciation for life along his journey in that floating house.\n\n66. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)\n\nIt’s the best entry in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise that gets a boost from the additions of Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg, an awesome motorcycle chase and Tom Cruise hanging from a plane.\n\n65. Wedding Crashers (2005)\n\nOwen Wilson and Vince Vaughn teamed up for the laugh fest of Summer 2005. “Wedding Crashers” earned rave reviews and made buckets of money, and even features a surprise appearance by Will Ferrell towards the film’s end.\n\n64. True Lies (1994)\n\nJames Cameron directs Arnold Schwarzenegger in “True Lies,” a movie tailor made for the summer season that proved nearly as successful as the duo’s work in the “Terminator” franchise.\n\n63. Forrest Gump (1994)\n\n“Forrest Gump” felt more like basic Oscar bait in 1994. But then everyone went to see it. In retrospect, the film doesn’t hold up quite as well. But it still features a great performance by Tom Hanks and has one of the highest box office totals ever for an Academy Award Best Picture winner.\n\n62. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)\n\nAnother Spider-Man reboot, already? Apparently Marvel Studios knew what it was doing, teaming with Columbia Pictures to relaunch the franchise with, arguably, its best Peter Parker yet in Tom Holland.\n\n61. Superbad (2007)\n\n“Superbad” followed the success of “Knocked Up,” giving the Judd Apatow family of films yet another success story and launching the movie careers of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera.\n\n60. Wall-E (2008)\n\nMuch of the first half of “Wall-E” feels almost like a silent film. But it contains some of the best sound and visuals of any film you’ll see, animated or live action. It served as proof that Pixar could do no wrong, even when the company got artsy.\n\n59. Inglourious Basterds (2009)\n\n“Inglourious Basterds” is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through. But it’s leading man, Brad Pitt, and enticing plot line about an assassination plot to takedown Hitler, earned it big money at the box office. It’s the director’s second highest grossing film behind “Django Unchained.”\n\n58. The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)\n\n“The 40-Year-Old Virgin” seemingly came out of nowhere in 2005 and made a star of everyone involved. Co-written by Steve Carrell, the movie would prove a star vehicle for both the actor and producer/director Judd Apatow.\n\n57. Twister (1996)\n\nMuch of “Twister” has proven to be inaccurate from a scientific standpoint and some of the special effects don’t hold up. But, back in 1996, there were few things cooler than seeing a bunch of storm chasers risk their lives by getting as close as possible to massive tornadoes.\n\n56. Inside Out (2015)\n\nPixar’s most emotionally complex film was a real win thanks to the voice talents of Amy Poehler, Richard Kind, Lewis Black, Bill Hader and others. The film grossed over $850 million worldwide.\n\n55. Star Trek (2009)\n\nYou kind of just know the 2009 “Star Trek” reboot is going to work right from the opening, riveting moments. From there, we get to know new versions of the core “Star Trek” characters that would entertain us for the next two hours.\n\n54. There’s Something About Mary (1998)\n\n“There’s Something About Mary” was a sleeper hit that became one of the biggest movies of 1998. It remains one of the most critically acclaimed comedies of all time.\n\n53. The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)\n\nThe conclusion of the originally “Bourne” trilogy is the franchise’s finest work with its best fight scenes and a final payoff for Jason Bourne’s journey.\n\n52. Coming to America (1988)\n\nEddie Murphy’s crowning achievement of the 1980s was the endlessly quotable “Coming to America.” The film had heavy expectations and Paramount Pictures limited press screenings of the film. But thanks to Murphy’s star power and appearances by numerous future stars, “Coming to America” became a mega-hit.\n\n51. Alien (1979)\n\nRidley Scott’s original “Alien” film operates like a traditional horror film with a trait – the monster revealed at the end is far more terrifying than you ever imagined. Word of mouth (and strong promotional materials) helped the movie earn a big box office upon its original release and subsequent re-releases.\n\n50. Gladiator (2000)\n\n“Are you not entertained?” The answer for both critics and audiences was a big yes when it comes to “Gladiator.” The film would win big at the Academy Awards an establish Russell Crowe as a top-tier star.\n\n49. Minority Report (2002)\n\nSteven Spielberg’s “Minority” report plays with the interesting concept that all of the world’s crimes can be predetermined and, thus, prevented, thanks to psychic beings called “precogs.” It brings to mind social and moral issues, while having all the elements of a big blockbuster, such as awesome visuals and a bankable star in Tom Cruise.\n\n48. Batman Begins (2005)\n\nChristopher Nolan brilliantly tackled the origin story of Batman, while setting the course for one heck of a trilogy. It helps that he finally found the right guy to wear the Bat Suit in Christian Bale.\n\n47. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)\n\nArguably, the best film in the “Harry Potter” franchise, “Order of the Phoenix” is also the most action packed. The stakes feel higher as Harry comes into his own.\n\n46. Knocked Up (2007)\n\nThe poster said it all: A picture of curly haired Seth Rogan with the question, “What If this guy got you pregnant?” Audiences were willing to pay a lot for the answer with “Knocked Up’s” amazing laughs earning it nearly $220 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n45. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)\n\nThe best “Star Trek” film ever made, “The Wrath of Khan” allowed fans to geek out in record numbers. The movie opened with the biggest weekend for any movie in history at the time.\n\n44. Magic Mike (2012)\n\nThe story of a 19-year-old guy who enters the world of male stripping comes straight from the life of Channing Tatum. As it turns out, lots of women (and some men) were eager to check out the toned abs (and more) of “Magic Mike,” which become enough of a phenomenon to inspire a supersized sequel.\n\n43. Saving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nWar movies aren’t generally considered popcorn films. But Steven Spielberg has a way of making anything he does appeal to mass audiences. “Saving Private Ryan” is a violent war film, especially the opening, but its themes and acting is what’s most chilling.\n\n42. Unforgiven (1992)\n\nClint Eastwood’s “Unforgiven” would go on to win big during awards season. But make no mistake, this was a movie aimed at mainstream audiences. “Unforgiven” was a thrilling and heavy western at time when many had written the genre off.\n\n41. Dirty Dancing (1987)\n\nIf this list counted video rentals and sales, “Dirty Dancing” might be in the top 10. The film did well at the box office upon its initial release with fans heading back to the theater time and time again.\n\n40. X2: X-Men United (2003)\n\nThe first X-Men film wet fans appetite for movies about Marvel’s greatest super team. But “X2: X-Men United’ set a new standard for comic book movies with the addition of fan-favorite characters like Nightcrawler, Colossus and Lady Deathstrike.\n\n39. Batman Returns (1992)\n\nDirector Tim Burton was doing dark comic book movies before that was the cool thing to do. With ‘Batman Returns,” he took that dark storytelling and packed with some of DC Comics’ most interesting characters and the stars – Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer – to play them.\n\n38. Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)\n\nEddie Murphy became such a huge star in the 1980s, which made the sequel to “Beverly Hills Cop” the most anticipated comedy in movie history. The franchise was such a huge success there are still rumors or a TV reboot.\n\n37. Shrek (2001)\n\nThe first “Shrek” film would launch a franchise that would become the cornerstone of DreamWorks. It also created a merchandising bonanza, including a stage musical and video games.\n\n36. The Fast and the Furious (2001)\n\nThere were other more anticipated films in the summer of 2001, but none caught on as a cultural phenomenon quite like “The Fast and the Furious.” The movie breathed life into the tricked out, car racing culture and made stars of its young cast. The rest is box office history.\n\n35. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nIt was the comic book no one could figure out why Marvel Studios was adapting. And it was the movie we couldn’t get enough of. “Guardians of the Galaxy” wound up decimating all other films at the box office in 2014.\n\n34. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nRobert Zemeckis’ mix of live action and animated characters in 1988 proved groundbreaking and, thanks to its $300 million-plus worldwide box office, injected new life into the Looney Tunes brand.\n\n33. Inception (2010)\n\nThe movie about a dream within a dream, within a dream, represents one of the most complex heist movies in cinema history. But it’s thick plot didn’t keep movie-goers away, who flocked to Christopher Nolan’s mind bending feature in July 2010.\n\n32. The Fugitive (1993)\n\nThis film based on the 1960s TV series of the same name had it all. A star leading man in Harrison Ford, the pure wit of Tommy Lee Jones and a suspenseful storyline that kept you wondering what would happen next.\n\n31. Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nThanks to Kristen Wiig, and writing partner Annie Mumolo, producer Judd Apatow was finally able to attach his name to a film aimed at the ladies. Audiences were more than ready for it, making “Bridesmaids” an R-rated juggernaut at the box office.\n\n30. Toy Story 3 (2010)\n\nThe third installment of Pixar’s greatest franchise came some 11 years after “Toy Story 2.” But fans’ love affair with Woody, Buzz and company hadn’t died down. “Toy Story 3” became the series’ highest grossing film and, arguably, its best.\n\n29. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nGeorge Miller’s “Fury Road” is essentially one long, mesmerizing chase scene built around a movie franchise much of the audience was probably unfamiliar with. But the use of practical effects paid off in a big way, earning the movie a huge box office and six Academy Award wins.\n\n28. Spider-Man 2 (2004)\n\nThe Spider-Man movie that may be forever impossible to top. Tobey Maguire nails every nuance of the Peter Parker character in the ultimate showcase for Marvel’s greatest hero. Finally, Spidey had a worthy feature film to his name.\n\n27. Speed (1994)\n\nIt was an awesome concept that seemingly anyone could have pulled off: A terrorist hooks up a bomb to a bus and if that bus goes under 50 mph, it blows up. The beneficiaries of “Speed’s” popularity were soon-to-be massive stars Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Though, only Keanu was wise enough to opt out of the lame sequel.\n\n26. Big (1988)\n\n“Big” not only made Tom Hanks a bankable star, but also became the first film directed by a woman (Penny Marshall) to gross $100 million at the box office.\n\n25. Aliens (1986)\n\nFor the second installment of the “Alien” franchise, James Cameron took over and crafted a thrilling action film with a female hero at the center. Of course, the monster were still a huge draw, helping “Aliens” rule the box office for a month.\n\n24. Independence Day (1996)\n\nThe promotional materials for “Independence Day” were like nothing that came before it. The film already released the image of the white house blowing up and had the industry’s biggest rising star at the forefront in Will Smith. It was a can’t miss and quickly became on the biggest blockbusters of all time.\n\n23. Wonder Woman (2017)\n\n“Wonder Woman” is the saving grace of the Warner Bros./DC Comics film universe. It’s the only consensus good film and the one that helped break ground in a movie industry that hasn’t showcased equality when it comes to women. An $820 million global box office tends to change things.\n\n22. Men in Black (1997)\n\nWill Smith could do no wrong in the 1990s and knew how to pick the films to maximize his market value. Technically, Smith wasn’t the lead actor in “Men In Black” (Tommy Lee Jones was billed above him). But, come on. Smith was the star that drove “Men In Black” to its massive box office and set up a huge franchise.\n\n21. The Avengers (2012)\n\nMarvel spent a few years building its cinematic universe to get to “The Avengers.” The payoff was huge. It became the third highest grossing movie of all time and set the stage for many more Marvel movies to come.\n\n20. The Blair Witch Project (1999)\n\nBefore the Internet was truly able to spoil things, “The Blair Witch Project” capitalized on a marketing campaign that suggested its story of three filmmakers who went missing in the woods while on the hunt for a mystical witch was real. Fans ate it up to the tune of nearly $250 million. It’s starting budget was just $60,000.\n\n19. The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nThe best “Star Wars” film actually made less than the two other movies in the original trilogy. And by less, we still mean a ton of money. But “Empire’s” legacy lies in its darkness and quality, that assured the “Star Wars” franchise would be here forever.\n\n18. Die Hard (1988)\n\nBruce Willis wasn’t exactly a movie superstar before “Die Hard” hit theaters. But the film, which has become one the most iconic action flicks ever, made him, aka John McClane,” into the ultimate movie hero.\n\n17. Finding Nemo (2003)\n\nIn 2003, it was a tiny fish that went missing that took Pixar to new heights. “Finding Nemo” became the highest grossing film in the studio’s history and launched a sequel that stands as Pixar’s overall box office champ in “Finding Dory.”\n\n16. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)\n\nThe first “Pirates of the Caribbean” film had everything going for it, which is saying something for a movie based on a Disney theme park ride. Yet, the wild fantasy ride led by Johnny Depp launched one of the biggest franchises in movie history and took Depp from art house status to box office titan.\n\n15. The Hangover (2009)\n\nThe trailer certainly showed promise. But who knew a movie about a bachelor party gone bad would work its way into being the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time?\n\n14. Back to the Future (1985)\n\n“Back to the Future” started off strong in 1985 and just got bigger. The film stayed at No.1 for an impressive 11 weeks and ruled the year, besting two big Sylvester Stallone sequels and an Oscar front runner at the box office.\n\n13. Ghostbusters (1984)\n\nOne of the great comedies to hit the big screen, “Ghostbusters” became a pop culture mainstay in American for decades to come. The film spent over a month atop the box office during one of the biggest years in movie history.\n\n12. Iron Man (2008)\n\n“Iron Man” accomplished so many things. It ushered in the current era of superhero films and established Robert Downey Jr. as a comeback star for the ages. Most importantly, it’s the movie that rebuilt Marvel in a pop culture juggernaut.\n\n11. Top Gun (1986)\n\nSome call it the first movie you had to wait in line to see. I don’t know if that’s true, but “Top Gun” certainly became a benchmark for a blockbuster, combining high-flying action, sex appeal and romance in a way that no film before it had. It cost $15 million to make and earned over $350 at the box office around the world.\n\n10. The Sixth Sense (1999)\n\n“The Sixth Sense” went old-school on its way to becoming a massive hit. Its opening weekend was good. But word of mouth about that surprise ending spread and fans kept going, eventually pushing it past a worldwide gross of $670 million, a number that is insane for a horror film.\n\n9. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011)\n\nSo this was it? The final installment of the lengthy “Harry Potter” franchise that was such a pop culture phenomenon even if you hadn’t seen the previous films you wanted to be part of that opening night. “Deathly Hallows Part 2” opening with nearly $170 million on its debut weekend.\n\n8. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\n\nEntertainment value rarely gets higher than this at the movies. “Raiders of the Lost Ark’s” legend has only grown since its release with some labeling its Stephen Spielberg’s greatest achievement.\n\n7. The Dark Knight (2008)\n\nYou knew “The Dark Knight” was going to be good, based on the awesomeness of “Batman Begins.” But then Christopher Nolan elevated things to another level when he included, perhaps, the most popular comic book villain of all time in the Joker. Adding to the buzz was a performance from Heath Ledger that was being called one of the greatest in movie history. “The Dark Knight” became just the fourth film ever to earn more than $1 billion worldwide.\n\n6. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\n\n“Judgment Day” was a force of nature. It had a villain that could turn into liquid metal, a Guns N’ Roses song, a predecessor that was groundbreaking and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator character as a good guy this time. Say what? The film’s special effects blew minds and the box office, giving it the second-best opening three-days in movie history behind the first “Batman” film.\n\n5. The Lion King (1994)\n\nThe culmination of Disney’s second golden age was the biggest thing the company had ever done. “The Lion King” stands as the seventh highest grossing animated film of all time. But it’s responsible for raising the bar for all animated films that came after. The movie’s release was on par with live action blockbusters, something that was unheard of back in 1994.\n\n4. Star Wars (1977)\n\nIn measuring the impact of “Star Wars” you have to even look beyond its record-setting box office. It’s buzz, which grew to massive levels led to costumes, toys, spinoffs, books, etc. This list doesn’t even consider the Special Editions of the franchise or maybe we’d be staring at No.1. Heck, maybe we’re kidding ourselves having it at No.4.\n\n3. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nTo know how magical E.T. was at the box office, all you have to do is know what the film accomplished. It surpassed “Star Wars” to become the highest grossing film of all time, something that seemed unfathomable at the time. It would hold that record for over a decade.\n\n2. Jaws (1975)\n\nSpoiler alert: The top three films on this list all come from the same director. In 1975, Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws” became the highest grossing film of all time and laid the blueprint for the modern blockbuster. Spielberg perfect the art of the summer build and payoff, setting a standard that only he could top.\n\n1. Jurassic Park (1993)\n\n“65 million years in the making!” That was the crazy tagline attached to “Jurassic Park.” Yet, it kind of felt appropriate. In all his brilliance, Steven Spielberg crafted movie around creatures that had fascinated American minds for ages. The fact that he made dinosaurs look real was a feat all on its own. Then there was the marketing campaign: Images of the T-Rex, people running in terror, Raptors creeping around. Everyone wanted in on the action, from McDonald’s to Hasbro. The result was Spielberg breaking his own record with the highest grossing film of all time."
