(episode)\n\nTranscript[]\n\nTranscriber's Notes: This 100th episode of Stargate SG-1 ended up breaking through the fourth wall many times, including showing the crew and sets of Bridge Studios, where Stargate films. Due to the unusual nature of this episode, I have attempted to label/identify the actual crew members whenever possible, using the DVD commentaries of Peter DeLuise, episode director, and episode writers Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie as a guide. Any mistaken attributions or omissions are likely my own.\n\nPlease note that Peter DeLuise is the director of this episode, and he's also acting in the role of \"the Director\" within the show. I have tried to distinguish when/if those roles differ. I have also distinguished when the actors playing the parody team are acting as \"themselves\", playing the roles of the cast of Wormhole X-Treme, or portraying the parody team members.\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE: SG-1\n\nEXCERPTS FROM 4.11 POINT OF NO RETURN\n\nINT—SURVEILLANCE VAN\n\n[Carter pulls Martin's Montana driver's license records up on the computer screen.]\n\nHAMMOND\n\n(in voiceover)\n\nI want to know who this man is.\n\nINT—DINER\n\n[O'Neill and Martin sit at a booth.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nOkay, Martin, what's this about?\n\nINT—HOTEL ROOM\n\n[Martin sees Teal'c lying on the vibrating bed.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nWho's he?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMurray.\n\n[Teal'c waves at Martin.]\n\nINT—SURVEILLANCE VAN\n\n[Teal'c and O'Neill listen over Martin's hidden microphone.]\n\nTANNER\n\n(via surveillance bug)\n\nYou've stopped taking your medication, didn't you?\n\nEXT—MONTANA FIELD, DAY\n\n[Tanner and his men approach Martin.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nI'm not crazy. And you're not a psychiatrist!\n\nINT—WAREHOUSE\n\n[Carter and Daniel are tied to chairs. Tanner takes a tazer and a blow torch out of his black bag and sets them on the table in front of them.]\n\nTANNER\n\nI'm running out of patience, and I really need to know.\n\n[He touches a button on a small metal rod, and it expands into a large club.]\n\n[Later…]\n\n[O'Neill and Teal'c have freed Carter and Daniel, who are still seated in the chairs. Martin is showing them a small handheld device.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWhat's that?\n\nMARTIN\n\nA mobile computing device. I snuck it out of Tanner's bag. It has multiple functions, see?\n\nINT—VAN\n\n[Martin sits next to Tanner in the back of the van.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nSo, are you going to drug me again?\n\nINT—MARTIN'S HOUSE\n\n[Daniel opens a kitchen cabinet and discovers a shelf filled with a plethora of prescription medications.]\n\nMARTIN\n\n(voiceover)\n\nIt triggered what I later realized was a suppressed memory.\n\nINT—WAREHOUSE\n\n[Tanner checks the fluid of a syringe filled with an unknown substance.]\n\nINT—DINER\n\nMARTIN\n\nI'm not just interested in outer space…I'm from outer space.\n\nPROLOGUE[]\n\nEXT—SPACE\n\n[An alien ship in orbit around Mars powers up and leaves orbit.]\n\nEXT—CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY\n\nINT—BRIEFING ROOM\n\n[The briefing room is dark. Carter stands near a projection screen. The rest of SG-1 and Hammond listen to her presentation.]\n\nCARTER\n\nEarly this morning, approximately 0230, the Kepler space probe captured this image as it passed by Mars.\n\n[Carter presses a button on a remote and a close up of a blurred image appears on the screen. Its shape is similar to the alien ship.]\n\nHAMMOND\n\nWhat is it?\n\nCARTER\n\nWell, sir, at first the people down at JPL thought it was an asteroid, but then they started picking up some strange energy readings. They tracked the object and realized that it was changing course and accelerating.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nAsteroids don't normally do that?\n\nCARTER\n\nNo, sir. The only logical conclusion is that it's a ship.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nDo we have any way of identifying it?\n\nCARTER\n\nAs a matter of fact, we do. The energy signature is consistent with a technology we've encountered before.\n\n[Carter presses the remote again and the image on the screen changes to a three dimensional image of Martin's escape pod.]\n\nCARTER\n\nA year ago, we found this pod buried in a field near Billings, Montana.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMartin.\n\n[Carter nods.]\n\nDANIEL\n\nWhat, you mean the little guy with the pills and the glasses and…? I thought his ship was destroyed.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nNo, he said they came down in a \"pod\" after abandoning the ship. He never said what happened to it after that.\n\nCARTER\n\nWell, if it is his ship, we'd better talk to him, because it's on a course for Earth, and it'll be here in three days.\n\nTEAL'C\n\nThen we must locate Martin Lloyd immediately.\n\n[Carter nods.]\n\nINT—WORMHOLE X-TREME SET\n\n[The four lead characters of Wormhole X-Treme duck and dodge between rocks on a sandy set as pyrotechnics go off around them. Shawn, the stuntman for the \"Colonel Danning character\" does a backflip into his position by the rock. They aim their weapons and act as if they are firing them into the surrounding area as the camera angle switches to a close up.]\n\nMARLOWE as DANNING\n\nHurry up, Major! We need that force shield!\n\nREESE as MONROE\n\n(playing with a small handheld prop)\n\nI'm trying, sir. But something's nullifying the electrolyte composite on the shield generator!\n\nGUNNE as LEVANT\n\nTry reversing the polarity!\n\n[\"Monroe\" nods and plays with the prop some more. She shakes her head.]\n\n\"MONROE\"\n\nIt's not working!\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\nWhat do you mean, it's not working?!?\n\n\"MONROE\"\n\nI MEAN, it's not working!\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\n(overacting)\n\nGod help us!\n\nPETER DELUISE playing THE DIRECTOR\n\n(offscreen)\n\nBANG! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.\n\n[The actors collapse to the ground, shaking and spasming as if being electrocuted until completely limp. Marlowe takes the longest before growing still.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAnd…cut!\n\n[A bell rings and a crew member claps a Wormhole X-Treme exit slate in front of the cast.]\n\nDAVID SINCLAIR, SG-1's Property Master, as BILL, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n\n(offscreen)\n\nBreak! Okay, we're good.\n\n[Crew members enter the set, including Stargate SG-1's stunt coordinator Dan Shea and assistant props master \"Evil Kenny\". From out of camera range, the Director and Martin stand by a monitor that shows the camera view of the set.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nWhat? That was awful! We have to do it again.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(ignoring Martin)\n\nCheck the gate. We are moving on. Print everything! Nice job, people! Good moves, Shawn!\n\n[The Director walks away from Martin, passing through Wormhole X-Treme's \"star portal\" which is a large round object with ramps, filled with Roman numerals and gaudy lights. Martin follows, trying to interrupt the Director until he finally gives up.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nUh-um-uh. Yeah! Yeah! Uh-uh…Great-great job, everybody. Uh…Yeah!\n\nEND PROLOGUE\n\nScript[]\n\nOPENING CREDITS\n\nINT—SGC BRIEFING ROOM\n\n[The lights are dimmed and on the projection screen is a promotional preview video for Wormhole X-Treme. Hammond and SG-1 watch as a starburst pattern is shown, and the four leads walk forwards in slow motion.]\n\nTV-SHOW ANNOUNCER\n\nPrepare for an X-Treme adventure. Four X-cellent heroes in an X-traordinary new sci-fi series! Starring Nick Marlowe as the wry Colonel Danning…\n\n[Individual shots appear of each cast member firing their weapon and diving forward from the star portal's ramp which bears a huge orange and red \"X\". The image changes to Marlowe as Danning in poorly coordinated hand-to-hand combat with thugs played by Andy Mikita and John Lennock.]\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\n(as the last \"thug\" falls)\n\nAs a matter of fact, it DOES say Colonel on my uniform.\n\n[Marlowe as Danning and Nikki Smook (executive producer Michael Greenburg's wife) as a very tall alien woman exchange smoldering looks as the other main cast members watch in the background. Danning grabs the woman by the shoulders.]\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\nHey! It's what I do.\n\n[He stands on tip-toes and kisses her.]\n\n[O'Neill raises his eyebrows, leaning his chin in his hand, looking bored.]\n\nTV-SHOW ANNOUNCER\n\nYolanda Reese as the brilliant Major Stacey Monroe…\n\n[The other cast members hurry out of frame as the camera centers on Reese as Monroe studying a large prop alien control panel.]\n\n\"MONROE\"\n\nThe positronic field emitters are off-line, but I can compensate by generating a feedback loop.\n\n[Carter looks bemused.]\n\nTV-SHOW ANNOUNCER\n\nRaymond Gunne as Doctor Levant…\n\n[Gunne as Levant and Marlowe as Danning are crouched by some rocks.]\n\n\"LEVANT\"\n\nDamn it, Colonel! Just because they're aliens and their skulls are transparent doesn't mean that they don't have rights!\n\n[Levant pants heavily and furrows his eyebrows.]\n\n[Daniel bites his lip and furrows his eyebrows.]\n\n[The camera shots are now individual close ups on each of the three introduced characters, who each turn and place their hands on their hips dramatically.]\n\nTV-SHOW ANNOUNCER\n\nAnd introducing Douglas Anders as Grell the Robot.\n\n[There is a zoom in on Anders as Grell, who is covered in silver makeup with a strange diamond shape on his forehead. He frowns heavily at the camera and starts to lift an eyebrow.]\n\n[Teal'c cocks his head and raises an eyebrow.]\n\n[The four characters exit the gate ramp through a shimmering dark blue field, very similar in shape and texture to the Stargate event horizon. A gaudy graphic depicting the Wormhole X-Treme logo takes up the entire foreground of the screen.]\n\nTV-SHOW ANNOUNCER\n\nWormhole X-Treme. Coming this fall, only on—\n\n[Hammond clicks off the video. The projection screen automatically retracts and the lights come on. Hammond spins in his chair to face SG-1.]\n\nDANIEL\n\nWell, that looked…familiar.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nI don't see it.\n\nCARTER\n\nMartin's involved in this?\n\nHAMMOND\n\nHe sold the idea to the studio. He is currently working on the production as a creative consultant.\n\nTEAL'C\n\nThen Martin Lloyd has seriously breached your security.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nDANIEL\n\nWhat? He obviously got the whole thing from his knowledge of the Stargate program.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWell, if the Air Force didn't want it to happen, they wouldn't have let it go this far.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nPlausible deniability. In the event of a future breach of security, we'll be able to point to this television program…that is, if it stays on the air.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nStill doesn't change the fact that Marty sold us out.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nHis motivations are of little concern at the moment. Our first priority is to find out everything he knows about that ship. Colonel, you're Wormhole X-Treme's new Air Force consultant.\n\nEXT—BRIDGE STUDIOS BACKLOT, DAY\n\n[The Director and two other crew members stand near some trucks and watch an explosion release a small puff of smoke.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nNo, no, no, no, no. Bigger. Much bigger.\n\n[Teamsters and other crew members mill around as O'Neill wanders across the lot, wearing his military uniform. Some crew members move a cart filled with chrome gadgets across the lot. An extra, elaborately dressed in a gaudy red outfit and made up as a green alien, walks by carrying a staff weapon over his shoulder and a guitar case in his other hand. O'Neill gives the \"alien\" extra as a second look as he approaches Bill and Gisella who are both wearing headsets and looking over a chart.]\n\nBILL\n\nCopy that. Okay, so far we've got forty-six extras. Make sure everybody's ready to go for that. Hair, makeup, wardrobe, costumes, and props. Has the props show-and-tell happened yet?\n\n(Gisella shakes her head)\n\nOh man, he's going to freak.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nExcuse me.\n\n(The two turn to O'Neill, Bill adjusting the headset control at his belt.)\n\nCan you tell me where I can find Martin Lloyd? He's one the bigwigs around here.\n\nBILL\n\n(adjusting the control)\n\nCopy that.\n\n(to O'Neill)\n\nSorry?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMartin Lloyd.\n\nBILL\n\nOh, yeah. Over there, by the trailers.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nThank you.\n\n[O'Neill leaves in the direction Bill indicated. Bill and Gisella turn back to their chart, but Bill glances up again towards where O'Neill left.]\n\nBILL\n\nWho's that guy?\n\n[Gisella shakes her head and shrugs.]\n\n[Nearby, Martin steps out of his trailer where Jan Newman, Stargate SG-1's makeup artist, and an actress stand waiting for him. The actress is dressed in a skimpy outfit. The skin on her face and torso is a lime green, and her arms are painted a duller green shade.]\n\nMARTIN\n\n(with fake smile)\n\nOh, they went with green? Okay. Well, it looks good. Great.\n\n[The two walk off as Martin still maintains the fake smile. Props Guy walks by carrying a bowl full of apples and a pineapple.]\n\nMARTIN\n\n(to Props Guy)\n\nWhoa-whoa-whoa. What is that?\n\nPROPS GUY\n\nIt's fruit. Scene 23.\n\nMARTIN\n\nOkay, Scene 23 takes place on another planet, so you think aliens eat apples?\n\nPROPS GUY\n\n(dryly)\n\nWhy not? They speak English.\n\nMARTIN\n\nGet some kiwis and spray paint them red.\n\nPROPS GUY\n\n(pulling a script out of his pocket)\n\nOkay, so now it'll go, uh: \"Nick walks into the garden of kiwi trees, says 'how like Eden this world is' and bites into a painted kiwi.\"\n\nMARTIN\n\nOkay, um, you're the prop master, right? That means you're a \"master\" of props. You figure it out.\n\n[Props Guy scowls and stuffs the script into the fruit bowl, walking back the way he came. O'Neill approaches as Martin sees another extra.]\n\nMARTIN\n\n(to extra)\n\nThat's what you're wearing? Okay. Looks good.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMartin?\n\nMARTIN\n\nYeah, yeah. Can I help you?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nJack…Colonel Jack O'Neill?\n\n(takes off his sunglasses)\n\nUnited States Air Force?\n\nMARTIN\n\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're the new military technical advisor. Right. Listen, don't speak to the actors.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMarty, it's Jack. Remember last year? Billings, Montana?\n\nMARTIN\n\nI've never been to Montana…but I am going to Sundance this year.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWhat about the name Tanner? Doctor Tanner? Hammond? Carter? Murray?\n\nMARTIN\n\n(shaking his head)\n\nSorry. Listen, I've got a concept meeting in ten minutes, and if I'm not there I'm on time, well… well they start without me. But come back tomorrow, and I'll…I'll show you around.\n\n[Martin walks off. O'Neill waits until he's out of sight and enters Martin's trailer.]\n\n[Nearby, another small explosion is set off. The Director slumps in disappointment.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nNo. Look at my lips. Big-ger.\n\nINT—MARTIN'S TRAILER\n\n[O'Neill has the cabinets open in the kitchen area of the trailer. They are filled with an assortment of vitamin bottles. He is on his cell phone.]\n\nHAMMOND\n\n(on phone)\n\nWhat have you got for us, Colonel?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWell, here's news. I think Martin's had his memory's erased again.\n\nINT—SGC BRIEFING ROOM\n\n[The rest of SG-1 and Hammond listen to O'Neill over the speakerphone.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(continuing)\n\nHe claims he doesn't remember me or anything about last year.\n\nDANIEL\n\nTanner and his boys must have gotten to him first.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYeah, well I checked out his trailer…\n\nINT—MARTIN'S TRAILER\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(continuing)\n\n…Didn't find any medication, but there are a lot of vitamins.\n\nHAMMOND\n\n(over phone)\n\nSend in a sample for analysis. In the meantime, keep an eye on Martin.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYes, sir.\n\n[O'Neill clicks off his cell phone and pockets it.]\n\nINT—BRIEFING ROOM\n\nCARTER\n\nSir, if Tanner and his men are involved, Colonel O'Neill could use some backup.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nI agree with you, Major. You leave in one hour.\n\nINT—WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Marlowe as Danning leads a blonde actress playing an alien princess out of some ruins. Several of the green alien extras that were seen wandering the set earlier are lying on the ground in front of them.]\n\n\"PRINCESS\"\n\nI cannot thank you enough, Colonel. It's been many bleems since my people were enslaved by the minions of Lord Varlock.\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\nHey, it's what I do-do.\n\n[As he leans over to kiss the \"princess\", he trips over an alien, stumbling into the actress.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nAw, this isn't working!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(offscreen)\n\nCut. Cut!\n\n[A bell sounds and the clapper claps the board in front of Marlowe's face. The actress places her hands on her hips, annoyed, as Marlowe stumbles off the set. O'Neill watches as the Director meets up with Marlowe.]\n\nBILL\n\n(offscreen)\n\nOkay, we're cut.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nNick, what's up?\n\nMARLOWE\n\n(cautiously walking over the extras)\n\nThis is SUPPOSED to be a love scene, and we're walking through all these dead aliens!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nUh, right. Well, it's continuity; you've just killed them all.\n\n[He touches up Marlowe's breath with an atomizer as makeup works with the actress playing the princess.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYeah, yeah, well can't-can't-cant we walk somewhere else?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nWell, Nick, there is no \"somewhere else.\" This is the planet we have, between here and here.\n\n(indicates the space with his hands)\n\nThat's all the set there is. And the reality of the scene dictates that there be dead aliens because you just killed them.\n\n[While the Director is speaking, SG-1 writer/producer Robert C. Cooper and Martin pass O'Neill and approach the set.]\n\nCOOPER\n\nWe could always go back to the way it was in the script…\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(feigning patience)\n\nNo, we can't. We've already established that one shot stuns, and two shots kills. Nick just shot everybody twice.\n\nMARTIN\n\nSo, three shots disintegrates them!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(approaches Martin and speaking low)\n\nOK, you know what? I'm going to pretend you didn't say that, because that is quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever heard you say.\n\n[Martin looks down, chastised, as the Director moves off. Martin glances at Cooper.]\n\nMARTIN\n\n(to Cooper)\n\nWhy are you looking at me like I'm an idiot? Why are you even on set? Go write something!\n\n[Cooper turns away and leaves.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nOooh! What color is the beam from the ray gun?\n\nMARTIN\n\nWe can't afford a beam. Sound effects.\n\n[Marlowe lets out a loud huff and waves his arms in exasperation.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nIt'll be great. You'll see.\n\n(to Bill)\n\nReset.\n\nBILL\n\nBack to ones!\n\n[Bill and the Props Guy move off the set. The Director tries to calm Marlowe and frames his face with his hands to pantomime a camera shot.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nNick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick. You're gonna be in close-up. The aliens will be below frame!\n\nMARLOWE\n\n(sulking)\n\nThe audience is going to know they're there.\n\n[The Director makes fists with his hands and clenches his teeth, barely staying calm.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nOkay, kill the dead aliens.\n\n(to Bill)\n\nAliens off the set.\n\nBILL\n\nAliens off the set!\n\n[Marlowe looks appeased as the director smiles falsely at him. The alien extras stand up and walk off the set. Bill approaches an alien mannequin still on the ground and leans down close with his megaphone.]\n\nBILL\n\nI said, ALIENS OFF THE SET!\n\n[Evil Kenny grabs the mannequin and scurries off. O'Neill smiles slightly. Marlowe stands nearby practicing different ways to say his next line.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nHey, it's what I do. It's what I do. It's what I do.\n\n[O'Neill watches Marlowe, who turns and notices him.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYou're the new military advisor.\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(smiling)\n\nYes, sir.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYou're the real deal, huh? You've seen action?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nThat would be…classified.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nOh, I like that. Sorta like a \"yes\", but really a \"no.\" This is realistic, right?\n\n(O'Neill looks puzzled.)\n\nThe uniform…? Camouflage…?\n\n[O'Neill studies the uniform. It is black, with a green and grey camouflage material over the sleeves and torso. The camouflage on top is not a complete \"overshirt\" because it is cut down the center and across the chest in an odd, angled cross pattern, showing a great deal of the black material underneath. The pants share the same mish-mash of camouflage colors.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(exhaling slowly)\n\nOh yeah, yep. You don't want to be a target out there in…space.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nThat's exactly what I said, so why aren't the aliens ever in camouflage?\n\nMARTIN\n\nOh, I-I fought for that, uh, Nick. But, the studio wants the aliens seen.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nAn alien wouldn't want to be seen, Martin. Think!\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMaybe, that's why they're dead?\n\nMARLOWE\n\nThat helps me! Thanks!\n\n[The Director finishes a discussion with Bill.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nCan we do this?\n\nBILL\n\nDoing this!\n\n[A bell rings and Marlowe turns to retake his place on the set. O'Neill notices the show's large \"X\" emblem is a patch on Marlowe's back and furrows his eyebrows. Martin notices O'Neill's expression.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nThe \"X\". I know what you're thinking. Um, it's a marketing thing. You see, I wanted to call the show \"Going to Other Planets\", but Research says that shows with \"X\" in the name get higher ratings.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nAh!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAaaaaaaand…action!\n\nINT—WAREHOUSE\n\n[Tanner sits at a table working on his laptop. Bob walks around some enters with some papers and approaches him.]\n\nBOB\n\nThe ship's on schedule. Preparations for departure are almost complete. There's only one…problem.\n\n[He hands Tanner a photograph, who looks at it and sighs.]\n\nTANNER\n\nThis is gonna complicate matters.\n\n[The photograph is an 8x10 of O'Neill and Martin on the Bridge backlot.]\n\nEXT—CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, DAY\n\nINT—HAMMOND'S OFFICE\n\n[Hammond is speaking on the red phone. As he speaks, he notices Fraiser standing in the doorway holding a file.]\n\nHAMMOND\n\nVery well, you have my authorization to begin surveillance.\n\n(pausing and motioning Fraiser inside)\n\nKeep a low profile, Major. We don't want to show our hand.\n\n(He hangs up the phone.)\n\nDr. Fraiser?\n\nFRAISER\n\nSurveillance on Martin Lloyd, I assume?\n\nHAMMOND\n\nHis house, actually. To help determine if Martin's old friends have returned.\n\nFRAISER\n\nTanner.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nThe idea is to determine if Tanner and the other aliens have been watching Martin. Mjr. Carter and Dr. Jackson will try to intercept frequencies being broadcast from inside his house.\n\nFRAISER\n\n(smiling slightly)\n\nOh , so like a surveillance surveillance.\n\nHAMMOND\n\n(stone faced)\n\nIn a manner of speaking. Are those the test results from the vitamins Col. O'Neill found in Martin's trailer?\n\nFRAISER\n\n(opening the file and handing him the results)\n\nYes, sir. They contain a significant amount of the chemical that Tanner used to block Martin's memory before.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nWhich confirms what we already suspected.\n\nFRAISER\n\n(nodding)\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nHAMMOND\n\nThe question is, what do they want Martin to forget?\n\nEXT—BRIDGE STUDIOS, DAY\n\nINT—SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Reese carries a script and heads determinedly towards Martin and the Director, dodging crew members and equipment, and passing producer Michael Greenburg, sitting in a director's chair.]\n\nREESE\n\n(jostling Evil Kenny)\n\nExcuse me.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(to Martin)\n\nNo, no. Because it undermines my authority, that's why.\n\n[Reese plants herself directly in front of Martin and the Director and leans on a stack of equipment boxes.]\n\nREESE\n\nGuys.\n\nMARTIN\n\n(smiling)\n\nAh, Miss Reese.\n\nREESE\n\nUh, I'm having a little trouble with Scene 27.

O'Neill heads over the table to check out the food. In the background, an actress is being made up. Teal'c, wearing a pink shirt and pants and a cafeteria cap, carries a plate of sandwiches. He offers them to various Teamsters on his way to the table, but they all wave him off. He reaches the table and sets down the platter roughly. The sandwiches look very unappetizing.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nNo takers?\n\nTEAL'C\n\nThis crew does not appear to enjoy the traditional dishes of Chulak.\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(wincing)\n\nEh, showbiz, huh?\n\n[Writer/Producer Joe Mallozzi and producer N.

I-I did it to myself.\n\nTEAL'C\n\nFor what reason?\n\nMARTIN\n\nWhen we went back to my planet and we saw that it was gone, I couldn't handle it. And the real estate job the Air Force got me was driving me crazy. I-I just wanted to forget…everything.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYou were just going to keep taking pills for the rest of your life?\n\nMARTIN\n\nAnother month, and the long term memory loss would've been permanent. Oh. Oh, no!\n\nTEAL'C\n\nWhat is the matter, Martin Lloyd?\n\nMARTIN\n\nWormhole X-Treme. The show is based on your Stargate program.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nDon't worry, it's on cable. So, why'd they bring you out of it? Why now?\n\nMARTIN\n\nThe ship's coming. We put it on a timer. Sort of a backup plan in case things didn't go right here.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWhy do they need you?\n\nMARTIN\n\nI still have the mobile computing device I stole from Tanner. They need it to access the ship.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWhere is it?\n\nMARTIN\n\nDon't worry. It's in a safe place.\n\nEXT—DESERT LOCATION, WORMHOLE X-TREME SHOOT, DAY\n\n[The mobile computing device is on a table with other props. Reese is having final touches done ot her makeup, hair and wardrobe as the rest of the crew prepares for a scene.]\n\nBILL\n\nAnd…rolling!\n\nCREW MEMBER\n\nSound, speed.\n\nREESE\n\n(calling for clarification from the director)\n\nWhere's this from?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nScanning with the quatra scanner.\n\n[Reese looks down at her belt.]\n\nREESE\n\nI don't have the scanner.\n\nBILL\n\nCut!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nDon't stop rolling!\n\nCREW MEMBER\n\nStill speeding.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nKenny, run, you underpaid, below-the-line freak!\n\n[Evil Kenny races to the table and grabs the alien computer. He races to Reese, who is moving to her mark.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nBilly, roll right now!\n\nBILL\n\nRoll!\n\nCREW MEMBER\n\nSpeed. Speedy!\n\n[Evil Kenny fumbles to place the device on Reese's belt. The Director waves his arms frantically.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nKenny, I love you, but you're not in this scene! Out!\n\n[Kenny finishes placing the device and hurries out of the frame.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nBilly!\n\nBILL\n\nRoll!\n\nCREW MEMBER\n\nSpeed. Speed. Speeding.\n\n[A crew member claps the slate in front of the camera.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAction!\n\nEXT—BRIDGE STUDIOS\n\nINT—BRIDGE STUDIOS PROPS WAREHOUSE\n\n[Teal'c stands by a device that looks suspiciously like the control panel on the Gadmeer vessel. O'Neill stands next to Martin as he frantically sorts through a variety of props.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nIt has to be here somewhere.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYou used a real alien device as a prop on the show?\n\nMARTIN\n\nWell, I'd forgotten what it was at the time. Besides, do you have any idea what it costs to make one of these things?\n\n[He shakes a prop to emphasize his statement, which looks like Urgo's gun.]\n\nPROPS GUY\n\n(entering)\n\nCan I help you?\n\nMARTIN\n\nWe're looking for the quatra scanner.\n\nPROPS GUY\n\nUh-uh. It's at the location.\n\nMARTIN\n\nWhat?!? Why?\n\nPROPS GUY\n\n(shrugging)\n\nSomebody put it in the scene at the last minute.\n\nMARTIN\n\nHow come?\n\nPROPS GUY\n\n(scoffing)\n\nI don't know. I just do my job, man.\n\n[Martin quickly leaves, O'Neill following. Martin calls back to Teal'c as he races out.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nMurray!\n\n[Teal'c shakes his head in irritation at his pseudonym and follows the two. Props Guy pulls a cell phone from his pocket and dials after they leave.]\n\nPROPS GUY\n\nYeah, get me Agent Barrett.\n\nINT—NID WAREHOUSE\n\nBARRETT\n\n(on telephone)\n\nAll right, good work.\n\n(He hangs up and calls to his men)\n\nLet's go, guys. We've got 'em.\n\n(to Carter and Daniel)\n\nYou two, stay here.\n\nCARTER\n\nWhat?!?\n\nBARRETT\n\nWe want this ship. It's too important. Frankly, I don't trust either one of you. Agent Smith, watch over these two and make sure they don't move. Let's go, guys.\n\n[Barrett and the others leave as Smith, a large burly agent, walks over and stands near Carter and Daniel in an intimidating stance. Carter smiles and leans back in her chair as Daniel raises his eyebrows and looks away innocently.]\n\nEXT—DESERT LOCATION, WORMHOLE X-TREME SHOOT, DAY\n\n[A red sedan drives past several tractor trailers before parking. O'Neill, Martin, and Teal'c exit the vehicle.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nMurray, look around. Marty, you're with me.\n\n[O'Neill and Martin head in one direction, while Teal'c dons his black overcoat over a blue Hawaiian shirt and walks in another direction.]\n\nEXT—LOCATION SET, DAY\n\n[Reese as \"Monroe\", carrying the \"quatra scanner\" passes Gunne as \"Levant\" and Anders as \"Grell\".]\n\n\"MONROE\"\n\nI'm picking up the same low-level gamma radiation we came across in the Photon belt.\n\n\"LEVANT\"\n\nWhat? That doesn't make sense. I mean, those aliens couldn't have just disappeared, could they…have?\n\n[Gunne turns to Anders who remains back to, staring across the desert location.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(offscreen)\n\nAnd, turn…turn…Doug?\n\n[Anders turns around at his name being called.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nCut! Perfect! And tail slate!\n\n[The tail slate claps in front of Reese's face. The director stands near the camera and sound operators.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nGood. And Doug, you were supposed to turn, remember? Okay, print everything! Moving on.\n\n[The director and crew members move to a new area as O'Neill and Martin head over to Reese.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nGood scene.\n\nREESE\n\nThanks.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYou really nailed it. Let me take this stuff for you.\n\n[He holds out his hands and Reese unclips her belt, dropping it before handing it, her gloves and the \"quatra scanner\" to O'Neill.]\n\nREESE\n\nWhoops, there you go.\n\n[She smiles and walks off. O'Neill gestures to Evil Kenny, who's wearing bright yellow.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYellow!\n\n[Kenny comes over and O'Neill hands him the other props while palming Martin's alien computer, the \"quatra scanner.\" He taps Martin on the shoulder and moves off the set, where Anders and Gunne still stand, casually talking to each other]\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(to Martin)\n\nLet's go.\n\nMARTIN\n\nNo, no wait! They're just about to shoot the big finish.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nToo bad!\n\nMARTIN\n\nI'm not leaving, Colonel.\n\n[O'Neill reaches back and grabs Martin by his jacket lapel, dragging him away.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nOkay, maybe I am.\n\n[O'Neill and Martin walk past the tractor trailers and climb up some steps to stay unnoticed in the back of one of the trucks.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(gesturing with the computing device)\n\nYou can control the ship from here with this?\n\nMARTIN\n\nUh, maybe. But do I have to?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYes, Marty. You—\n\n[O'Neill spots movement out of the corner of his eye and quickly hides the device inside his jacket. Tanner and his men come around the corner and enter the truck aiming weapons at O'Neill and Martin.]\n\nTANNER\n\nYou can hand me the device, Colonel.\n\n[O'Neill shows his empty hands.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWell, this is getting old.\n\n[Teal'c appears behind them and raises a handgun. He remains outside the truck.]\n\nTEAL'C\n\nLower your weapons.\n\nTANNER\n\nLooks like we have a situation.\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYou know, guys, you can walk away from this. We're not going to come after you.\n\nTANNER\n\nWhat about your friends at the NID? No more hiding. Where's the device?\n\nO'NEILL\n\nWhat…device?\n\nTANNER\n\nColonel, we let you escape because we knew Martin would lead you right to it.\n\n[Martin closes his eyes and sighs. O'Neill's cell phone rings.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nThat's me. You mind-mind if I…\n\n[He cautiously reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out his phone. Making slow movements, he answers.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nO'Neill.\n\nINT—NID WAREHOUSE\n\n[Carter is on her cell phone while Daniel stands back to her, working with something unseen.]\n\nCARTER\n\nSir, it's me.\n\nThe remainder of this telephone conversation switches scenes between Carter and O'Neill's locations.\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(smiling in a casual manner)\n\nHey, Carter, how you doing?\n\nCARTER\n\nThe NID have made your position. They'll be there any minute.\n\nO'NEILL\n\n(his expression becomes serious as he looks at Tanner)\n\nEverything all right?\n\nCARTER\n\nIt is now.\n\n[Carter turns to watch Daniel. He's been tying up Agent Smith, who looks stunned and sports a large bump on his cheek. Smith's tie has been used as a gag and Daniel tightens it at the back of his head before clapping Smith on the shoulders.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nI'll be in touch.\n\n(He hangs up)\n\nTime's up, guys. The NID's on its way.\n\nMARTIN\n\n(pointing up)\n\nLook! They're too late!\n\n[Martin jumps off the bed of the truck, stumbling slightly before righting himself.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nI'm okay, Murray.\n\n[Martin races off as the others make their way down the steps, holstering their weapons. They all look up and see a large white cloud descending. Thunder claps as the wind picks up.]\n\nEXT—LOCATION SET, DAY\n\n[Reese as Monroe moves into a crouched defending position, holding her weapon. Behind her is Gunne as Levant, who's studying a large boulder. Anders as Grell stands nearby.]\n\n\"MONROE\"\n\nWe should return to the star portal before the aliens return.\n\n\"LEVANT\"\n\nWhat? What? I haven't finished translating the alien text. Grell, what-what do you think?\n\n[\"Grell\" opens his mouth to respond, but before he can say his line, Reese stands from her crouched position.]\n\nREESE\n\nWhat the hell is that?\n\nGUNNE\n\nIs-is that ours?\n\n[Martin jumps into the camera shot, waving frantically to the camera man and pointing behind him.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nKeep rolling! Keep rolling!\n\n[Crew members turn and look to where they're pointing. The Director does a double take.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nYeah, keep rolling. Pan around, you monkeys!\n\nCREW MEMBER\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMARLOWE\n\nHey? What's this about? I'm supposed to be in all the cool scenes!\n\n[The camera spins to show Marlowe hopping off his chair. His uniform is torn and his chest half exposed. Dirt and blood-like makeup effects cover him. Other crew members are looking at the sky behind him, muttering and crying out in surprise. Martin stands in front of the camera.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nTilt up! Tilt up!\n\n[The camera man follows the direction, and above a set light, the large alien ship gracefully appears through the clouds. Thunder rumbles and a large wind blows around all the cast and crew.]\n\n[O'Neill, Teal'c, and Tanner and his men remain behind the crew, among the trucks.]\n\nTANNER\n\nColonel, please. You know as well as I do, they're never going to leave us alone.\n\n[At that moment, three black SUVs come racing across the desert.]\n\nTANNER\n\nThere's nothing for us here. It's time for us to go.\n\n[O'Neill looks between Tanner and the approaching NID vehicles for a few moments before reaching into his jacket and pulling out the device.]\n\nO'NEILL\n\nYou officially owe me one.\n\n[Tanner sighs in relief.]\n\nBOB\n\nWhat about Martin?\n\nTEAL'C\n\nI believe Martin Lloyd has chosen a new path.\n\n[Teal'c turns to the set, where Martin stands by Marlowe, grinning widely. The crew stand in pleased shock, the cameras capturing the image on film.]\n\nMARTIN\n\n(to Marlowe)\n\nWe're going to win an Emmy for this, visual effects category.\n\nTANNER\n\nThank you, Colonel. We won't forget this.\n\n[Tanner presses a button, and the three aliens disintegrate in the manner of the original Star Trek series transporter. O'Neill and Teal'c watch for a moment before joining the rest of the crew. The alien ship powers up and departs.]\n\nMARTIN\n\nCut it! Print it! That's a wrap!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(stunned)\n\nUh, yeah…cut!\n\n[The Director and Martin shake hands. In the background, Stargate SG-1 producers Michael Greenburg and Brad Wright, wearing Wormhole X-Treme jackets look in the sky.]\n\nGREENBURG\n\nCool special effect.\n\nWRIGHT\n\nI've seen better.\n\nGREENBURG\n\nAh, we'll fix it in post.\n\nWRIGHT\n\nYeah. So, you think we can get eighteen in?\n\n[Wright glances at his watch as he and Greenburg walk closer to where the crew is gathered.]\n\nGREENBURG\n\nYeah, if we cut back on the Mulligans…You think that's funny?\n\nWRIGHT\n\nYeah, that's good enough for a walk away.\n\nGREENBURG\n\nWhen's a good time to fade out?\n\nWRIGHT\n\nEh, right about…now.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nINT—WORMHOLE X-TREME SET\n\n[There is a focus on the orange \"X\" of the Wormhole X-Treme star portal ramp. The four main cast members walk through the portal and stand dramatically.]\n\nTV-SHOW ANNOUNCER\n\nStay tuned for a special, behind the scenes look at Wormhole X-Treme.\n\nINT—SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Bocher speaks to someone off camera. In the background are the other three actors, waiting for a scene and looking bored.]\n\nBOCHER\n\nI'm Christian Bocher. I'm portraying the character of Raymond Gunne, who portrays the character of Dr. Levant, which is based on the character Daniel Jackson, portrayed by the actor Michael Shanks, originally portrayed by the actor James Spader…in the feature film.\n\n[He nods in satisfaction, then looks at his audience in concerned puzzlement.]\n\nBOCHER\n\nAre you okay?\n\nINT—ALIEN WALL SET, WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAction!\n\n\"LEVANT\"\n\nLook out! Aah! Ooh!\n\n[A sequence of takes of the same scene occurs. In it, Gunne/Levant is constantly bombarded with prop rocks falling on him while he stumbles and collapses to the floor, crying out with sounds of agony as each rock hits him. On the fourth take, although he blocks it with his forearm, a \"boulder\" falls directly on his head.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAnd…cut!\n\n[A bell rings, and Gunne shifts the prop boulder off his head, sputtering.]\n\nGUNNE\n\nNo…no…no!\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(rushing to him)\n\nAre you okay? Are you okay?\n\nGUNNE\n\nNo! I'm not okay! You—you go!\n\n[Gunne shoves the director at the pile of rocks in irritation.]\n\nGUNNE\n\n(cradling his elbow)\n\nIce, can I get some ice?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(leading him off the set)\n\nAll right, let's get some ice in here.\n\nINT—SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Peter DeLuise, director is explaining the marks and giving instructions to his brother Michael DeLuise, who has played Marlowe/Col. Danning.]\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\n(gesturing)\n\nAnd this is the eye-line.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nWormhole X-Treme. It's space. You can do anything in space. You know, the space…you've got the space between your teeth, the space—personal space…\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nRight. Okay, so you're standing here.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nOkay.\n\nINT—ALIEN WALL SET, WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Marlowe as Danning performs the stunt fight shown in the \"preview\", badly pretending to knock out Andy Mikita and John Lennock.]\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, it does say \"colonel\" on my uniform.\n\n[The tail slate snaps shut in front of Marlowe. The Director spritzes water on Marlowe as he frowns and looks down at his costume.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYou know, it doesn't say \"colonel.\"\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nOh.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nDid anyone ever think of that?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(trying to spray more water on him)\n\nUm, it's just a figure of speech.\n\n[The Director moves off camera.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nWell, it's a figure of speech that I can't figure out, because I'm not seeing \"colonel\" on my uniform.\n\n[He gives an annoying laugh in exasperation.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nOkay, um, somebody get me the word \"colonel.\" Oh, get me a sharpie pen.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nCould it be here? Could it be here?\n\n[Marlowe indicates the patch indicating an oval map of the Earth, and other spots on the costume as he speaks.]\n\nINT—WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Peter DeLuise and Michael DeLuise are speaking near the entrance.]\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nYou realize this is not a real show, right?\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nWhat are you talking about? You're saying that Wormhole X-Treme is not a real show. We did all this…all this is-\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\n(shrugging)\n\nYeah, it's not a real show. It's a fake show.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nDoes my agent know about this?\n\nINT—ALIEN WALL SET, WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[A Stargate SG-1 slate claps in front of the camera. The four leads are standing around in front of the wall.]\n\n[A few moments later, the camera angle has moved closer. \"Jimmy\", the focus player for Stargate SG-1, uses a tape measure to judge Michael DeLuise's distance from the camera. Peter DeLuise is speaking to Michael DeLuise in the foreground while the other three loiter near their marks, waiting for shot to start.]\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nYou're heroic. And just look over here at this eye line over here.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nThis isn't a real show?\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nNo. It's not a real show.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nIf it's not a real show, then why are you telling me what to do?\n\n[Still later, Peter DeLuise is no longer on camera. The other three stars move into position standing sideways next to each other as Michael DeLuise stands, hands on his hips, pondering.]\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nHow could this not be a real show, if-if we're doing it right now?\n\nINT—WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Peter DeLuise and Michael DeLuise are speaking near the entrance.]\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\nAm I getting paid real money?\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nYeah, you're getting paid real money.\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\n(rolling his eyes and letting out his breath)\n\nWell, I…whoa. So, what plane of reality are we on right now?\n\nINT—ALIEN SET, WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[The \"cast\" is performing a scene from the preview. The three cast members lounge in the back while Marlowe as Danning and the Nikki Smook as the tall alien woman stand in the foreground.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(offscreen)\n\nAnd we're heaving…we're heav—\n\n[The \"alien woman\", breathing heavily, slaps \"Danning\" across the cheek. He grasps her by the shoulders.]\n\n\"DANNING\"\n\nHey! It's what I do.\n\n[He leans in, standing on tip toes to kiss her passionately.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(offscreen)\n\nAnd cut.\n\n[The other cast members relax as Marlowe turns to the director.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nAre you sure you can't see the difference in our heights? Can I get a half-apple?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nOkay, let's get—let's get a half apple.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nI'm looking straight up her nose!\n\n(to Nikki)\n\nYou don't have to hit me that hard, either.\n\n[A few moments later…]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nI think you can really see the difference between our heights.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nYou…no. I don't…It's not—it's not obvious.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nLook, look, I'm going to measure it.\n\n[He takes his hand and moves it flat from his forehead to her own face, where it end up just below her nose. Nikki attempts to keep from laughing.]\n\nMARLOWE\n\nI'm not.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nYeah, but on this lens, it looks right. It's okay.\n\nMARLOWE\n\n(skeptically)\n\nFrom this angle, it looks like we're the same height?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nYes, I swear to God.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYou wouldn't lie to me.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\n(lying)\n\nI wouldn't lie to you.\n\n[Marlowe puts his hands on his hips, and he and Nikki look at each other.]\n\nINT—WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[Reese leans on something at the wall set and speaks to the Director, who is off camera.]\n\nREESE\n\nHow come I never get to kiss anybody?\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nWell, it's…uh, there's being episodes written for you…very soon.\n\nREESE\n\n(turning away, disgusted)\n\nSure.\n\nEXT—DESERT LOCATION, WORMHOLE X-TREME SET, DAY\n\n[Anders as Grell stands with his arms crossed over his chest, smiling.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nJust one eyebrow.\n\n[Anders raises both eyebrows.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nNo, just the one.\n\nINT—ALIEN WALL SET, WORMHOLE X-TREME SOUNDSTAGE\n\n[The three other cast members are in positions, standing sideways in heroic poses. Marlowe is in the foreground, facing forward. His hands are on his hips as he looks at the floor for his mark.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAnd, turn your back to me.\n\n[Marlowe cautiously starts turning his back to the Director.]\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nTurn all the way around to me. And do the annoying thing, and then look back. And…action!\n\nMICHAEL DELUISE\n\n(dropping out of the Marlowe/Danning character)\n\nHow could this not be a real show?\n\n[The other three relax and laugh.]\n\nPETER DELUISE\n\nHooh. Oh, forget it.
