        "text": "THE FILM\n\nIn Los Angeles in 1992, after a brief car chase, police pulled unarmed Rodney King from his car and brutally beat him. The incident was captured by a photographer living nearby and his video was released to the news media, unleashing an unparalleled series of marches, protests, and rioting. In news footage and photographs from that time, the critically-acclaimed film LA 92, from Academy Award winners Dan Lindsay and TJ Martin, tells the story of King’s arrest, beating, and trial, and the subsequent events that shook the city of Los Angeles to its core.\n\nTHE DISCUSSION GUIDE\n\nThis discussion guide explores the roots of the violence, the typical characteristics of riots, attempts at police reform, and the relevance of King’s story for our time. A topical film that will touch off animated discussion of contemporary policing issues."
