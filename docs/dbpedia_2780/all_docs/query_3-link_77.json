        "text": "The popcorn's been popped, the sweatpants are on, and the evening is your oyster. Your next challenge: Figuring out exactly which of the best movies available to you is the one you're going to watch tonight. No matter what you're looking for—a rom-com, a murder mystery, a sad film, a great musical movie—there are plenty of must-watch films in your chosen genre to settle in with for the first (but probably not the last) time.\n\nWe movie lovers at Marie Claire know how time-consuming picking a great movie can be, so we did the work for you. We combed through movie rankings, critical reviews, and award nominations, and spoke to fellow pop culture fans to bring you this list of crucial must-watch films. Of course, you can expect to see well-known classic films like Casablanca and The Sound of Music on this list, in addition to movies from iconic directors like Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and Alfred Hitchcock. But modern masterpieces like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Get Out stand up just as well and are on this list, too.\n\nThe must-watch movies below are modern classics, the best of the best, the essential films that millions of people are probably jealous that you're getting to see for the first time. They span multiple countries, languages, and decades. (A bonus: You’ll also find must-know facts and exactly why each film is considered the “best.”) And because pulling these movies was a hard enough task in itself, we've decided to leave this list unranked. Feel free to decide for yourself how your favorites stack up to the rest on this list, and if we've left a title off, don't yell at us too harshly. A list as subjective as this is meant to be debated, after all. Without further ado, in no particular order: The best movies of all time.\n\nThe Best Romance Movies of All Time\n\nThere are a few things you can (almost) always expect from a romance movie: a love story (duh!); attractive protagonists; and a happy ending—usually. Maybe you need to be reminded that true love is out there. Or maybe you need to show your partner what real romance looks like. Some of the movies on this list are funny, and some are the ultimate in sad romance films, but there’s one thing all of these romantic films have in common: They're sure to pull on your heartstrings and make you believe in love all over again.\n\nCasablanca (1942)\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nStars: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 99%\n\nFor fans of: black and white films and worldly settings\n\nSet in the early years of World War II in Casablanca, Rick Blaine's (Humphrey Bogart) nightclub is an oasis for refugees despite the warnings he gets from local authorities. But things get rocky when an ex-lover and her boyfriend show up, bringing with them a challenge that Rick has to face. One of the most famous classic Hollywood romance films of all time, Casablanca is a love story you won't forget.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nDirector: Nick Cassavetes\n\nStars: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Marsden\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 53%\n\nFor fans of: unwavering love stories and steamy kisses\n\nRyan Gosling. Rachel McAdams. An on-screen kiss that's impossible to forget. The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks's 1996 novel, is a must-watch for all of the hopeless romantics out there who believe they'll eventually find their way back to their one true love. \"It wasn't over. It still isn't over!\"\n\nwatch\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nStars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 87%\n\nFor fans of: tragic love stories and real-world disasters\n\nNeed we say more? If you haven't watched Titanic yet (please don't admit this out loud), do yourself a favor and stream it on Netflix immediately.\n\nwatch\n\nA Star Is Born (2018)\n\nDirector: Bradley Cooper\n\nStars: Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam Elliot\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 90%\n\nFor fans of: musical movies and remakes\n\nIf you were alive in 2018, you most definitely heard about Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's on- and off-screen chemistry thanks to their roles in the hit adaptation of A Star Is Born. The movie centers on rockstar Jackson Maine (Cooper) and struggling artist Ally (Gaga) who fall in love while Maine pushes Ally into the spotlight and confronts his own demons. Make sure to have a pack of tissues handy.\n\nwatch\n\nBefore Sunrise (1995)\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater\n\nStars: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Erni Mangold\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nFor fans of: Europe and love at first sight\n\nIn this swooningly romantic movie from Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke play a pair of travelers—she French, he American—who have a chance meeting in Vienna and decide to spend the evening before his departing flight walking around the city and talking to one another. In 2005, the sequel Before Sunset continues the story, and then in 2015 the trilogy is wrapped up with Before Midnight. All of them are worth watching over and over.\n\nwatch\n\nYou've Got Mail (1998)\n\nDirector: Nora Ephron\n\nStars: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 69%\n\nFor fans of: online dating and rivals\n\nThe Marie Claire team is *very* passionate about You've Got Mail. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the 1998 drama/romance tells the story of two neighborhood bookstore rivals who absolutely hate each other in real life, then fall in love online, and well...we won't spoil the rest for you.

But it's worth seeing in full to relive Nora Ephron's groundbreaking screenwriting, plus the easy banter between America's sweetheart Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal (it kind of set the stage for modern rom-coms as we know them).\n\nwatch\n\nLove Jones (1997)\n\nDirector: Theodore Witcher\n\nStars: Larenz Tate, Nia Long, Isaiah Washington\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 80%\n\nFor fans of: Chicago and dramedies\n\nA photographer (Nia Long) and a poet (Larenz Tate) fall in love in one of the best romance movies of all time.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nDirector: Rob Reiner\n\nStars: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nFor fans of: fairytales and adventures\n\nThere are so many things packed into The Princess Bride: historical fantasy, sweeping romance, laugh-out-loud comedy, subtle satire, Robin Wright and Mandy Patinkin!

His response, of course, comes with a supersized dose of that classic, bumblingly awkward Hugh Grant charm.\n\nwatch\n\nPast Lives (2023)\n\nDirector: Celine Song\n\nStars: Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 95%\n\nFor fans of: subverted love triangles and what-ifs\n\nNora (Lee) and Hae-sung (Yoo) were childhood sweethearts growing up in Seoul, South Korea, but after Nora's family immigrated to Canada, their lives went down different paths. Celine Song's directorial debut follows the pair as they reunite in NYC over two decades later, facing questions of lingering feelings, nostalgia, and in-yun, or the Korean concept of fate derived from Buddhism.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Best Comedy Movies of All Time\n\nSometimes, we all need a little cheering up, and what better way to do that than with a feel-good movie that makes you laugh?

Of course, the fact that he hired her only after finding out she was engaged to someone new might have something to do with it, but Russell is hilarious and their chemistry is bananas in this romance.\n\nwatch\n\nSome Like It Hot (1959)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nStars: Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\nFor fans of: impersonations and comedic duos\n\nIf you don't know why Miss Marilyn Monroe was and is such a big deal, take a look at this one.

If you've never seen it, know that it's one of the best teen movies ever made, from the script to the acting (two words: Heath. Ledger.) to the speech-making and wooing. It feels like a modern Shakespearean comedy because it is. (Ever heard of Taming of the Shrew?)\n\nwatch\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spiderverse (2018)\n\nDirector: Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman\n\nStars: Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nFor fans of: stunning animation and relatable protagonists\n\nIf you love superhero movies, this Spider-Man standalone may become your favorite of them all.

Spider-Men?) popping up in his world.\n\nwatch\n\nLegally Blonde (2001)\n\nDirector: Robert Luketic\n\nStars: Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 70%\n\nFor fans of: female empowerment and chick flicks\n\nHeard of the bend and snap? If you can believe Legally Blonde came into our lives more than two decades ago, it's time to give this classic feel-good movie a watch if you haven't already—even if just to witness the evolution of Reese Witherspoon and her incredible acting.

For the project, he utilized a microbudget, three iPhone 5Ss, and a cast of many untrained actors, finding his leads in two transgender women and real-life friends, Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor, whom he discovered outside of an LGBTQ+ center in L.A. The two play sex workers and close friends Sin-Dee Rella (Rodriguez) and Alexandra (Taylor), who set out to find Sin-Dee’s boyfriend and pimp when they find out he cheated on her when she was carrying out a recent prison sentence.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (2006)\n\nDirector: David Frankel\n\nStars: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 75%\n\nFor fans of: fashion montages and Stanley Tucci\n\nThis movie is filled with iconic moments: There’s the infamous cerulean monologue, the perfect mid-aughts opening montage set to “Suddenly I See,” one of the most satisfying style transformations ever put on film, a grilled cheese sandwich containing $8 worth of Jarlsberg and, yes, the Chanel boots. What more could you ask for?\n\nwatch\n\nBarbie (2023)\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nStars: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 88%\n\nFor fans of: dolls and powerful women\n\nThe summer of 2023 will forever be remembered for its spectacular displays of female power, between Beyoncé and Taylor Swift’s sold-out world tours and, of course, the blockbuster release of Barbie. Come for the nostalgia, the perfectly choreographed dance scenes, and Ryan Gosling’s goofy turn as Ken, stay for the expert skewering of the patriarchy, a celebration of womanhood, and that America Ferrera monologue.\n\nwatch\n\nStep Brothers (2008)\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\nStars: Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Mary Steenburgen, Richard Jenkins\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 55%\n\nFor fans of: blended families and the Catalina Wine Mixer\n\nDon’t let the Rotten Tomatoes score fool you: As any real cinephile can attest, this film is one of the all-time greats. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll be inspired to form an entertainment company à la Prestige Worldwide with your rival-turned-best friend-slash-stepsibling and start churning out hit songs (“Boats ’N Hoes,” anyone?)—all the makings of a truly great movie.\n\nwatch\n\nMy Cousin Vinny (1992)\n\nDirector: Jonathan Lynn\n\nStars: Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio, and Marisa Tomei\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 87%\n\nFor fans of: courtroom comedies and scene-stealing women\n\nSure, a murder trial doesn't seem like it would be the best place for laughs, but proving that assumption wrong is just one of the surprises that catapulted this '90s comedy into the all-time must-watch category. After a pair of road-tripping New Yorkers are wrongly accused of killing a convenience store clerk, they enlist the help of Cousin Vinny (Pesci) and his fiancée Mona Lisa (Oscar winner Tomei) to prove their innocence.\n\nwatch\n\nPaddington 2 (2017)\n\nDirector: Paul King\n\nStars: Ben Whishaw, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 99%\n\nFor fans of: family movies and lovable creatures\n\nThis movie about a talking teddy bear with a big heart shows a heartwarming lesson about empathy and community to both kids and adults alike, as Paddington and the people who love him band together to help when the polite bear is falsely imprisoned.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Best Classic Movies of All Time\n\nLess of a genre and more of a distinction, we define \"classic movies\" as the kind of film that changed their respective genres forever. Being familiar with the films on this list will set you apart from the casual pop culture fan and put you on the road to becoming a movie buff. For a film to be a classic in our book, it should have some years on it, be universally loved, and have a major cultural impact. The classic movies below, all released over 25 years ago, check those boxes.\n\nRebel Without a Cause (1955)\n\nDirector: Nicholas Ray\n\nStars: James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nFor fans of: teen angst and the 1950s\n\nTwo words for you: James! Dean! The old Hollywood icon's second to last film, as teenager Jim Stark, before his untimely death in 1955 ended up being one of his most celebrated. The unlikely bond shared on-screen between him, John \"Plato\" Crawford (Sal Mineo), and Judy (Natalie Wood) gave American youths at the time a movie where they could finally see themselves on the screen.\n\nwatch\n\nA Raisin in the Sun (1961)\n\nDirector: Daniel Petrie\n\nStars: Sidney Poitier, Claudia McNeil, Ruby Dee\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 90%\n\nFor fans of: theatrical plays and social commentary\n\nA Chicago family, the Youngers, are about to receive a windfall that will change their lives, but they have different ideas on how to use the money.

Dandridge's performance as Carmen Jones got her nominated for an Oscar, making history as the first African American actress in a leading role to be nominated.\n\nwatch\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962)\n\nDirector: Robert Mulligan\n\nStars: Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Robert Duvall\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nFor fans of: historical stories and court cases\n\nScout Finch tells the story of how her father, Atticus, a small town lawyer in the rural South, defended a wrongfully accused black man in this adaptation of Harper Lee's beloved novel. Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is how most people who've seen this movie think of the character, and you will too when you see it.\n\nwatch\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\n\nDirector: George Roy Hill\n\nStars: Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 89%\n\nFor fans of: Westerns and buddy comedies\n\nRobert Redford! Paul Newman! Really strong facial hair game! What could go wrong? Well, actually, a train robbery does go wrong, leaving outlaws Butch Cassidy (Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Redford) on the run from a seriously dangerous posse as they try to leave rural Wyoming for Bolivia. It's a Western film you can't miss.\n\nwatch\n\n12 Angry Men (1957)\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\n\nStars: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nFor fans of: courtroom dramas and realistic thrillers\n\nThis classic film is ostensibly about a dozen white men on a jury arguing over whether a young Puerto Rican man actually killed his father (the class and race dynamics feel unfortunately familiar, 60-plus years later). But it's really about prejudice and stereotype and the assumptions we carry with us every day without realizing it. If you didn't get to watch this one in school, watch it now.\n\nwatch\n\nRocky (1976)\n\nDirector: John G. Avildsen\n\nStars: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 91%\n\nFor fans of: sports movies and underdog stories\n\nIt’s the classic underdog story that made Sylvester Stallone a household name. The movie follows boxer Rocky Balboa on the road to fight heavyweight champion Apollo Creed in a match deemed “a somebody vs. nobody.” The film, written by Stallone, would go on to win Best Picture at the Oscars in 1977.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Godfather (1972)\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nStars: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nFor fans of: mob dramas and gangster action\n\nYes, there are three parts to this trilogy that might require a night of bingeing. But there's really nothing like Francis Ford Coppola's depiction of the mob family of Don Vito Corleone. It's a chilling to the bone, action-packed story that's not one to miss.\n\nwatch\n\nJaws (1975)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nStars: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nFor fans of: tension-building suspense and iconic theme songs\n\nWhen Steven Spielberg made this movie, I’m unsure if he knew it would become the face of anti-shark propaganda, and make a whole generation scared to get in the water. Regardless, this movie about a sheriff, marine biologist, and fisherman hunting down a shark that’s terrorizing their beach town is a must-see.\n\nwatch\n\nDo the Right Thing (1989)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nStars: Danny Aiello, Giancarlo Esposito, Ossie Davis\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 91%\n\nFor fans of: slice-of-life stories and driving messages\n\nSpike Lee acts and directs in a film that marries comedy and drama perfectly. Roger Ebert's review is pretty spot-on, but to summarize: Lee builds a community in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, teeming with life and tension on the hottest day of the year. And then he rips it all apart. But it's so much more compelling than even that description. Lee handles all his characters with love, and there's no one who's truly evil, despite spot-on and heart-wrenching commentary about racism, classism, and poverty.\n\nwatch\n\nBack to the Future (1985)\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nStars: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nFor fans of: Comedic sci-fis and '80s references\n\nThis sci-fi film sees Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a time traveler who drives his flying Delorean back into the '50s after an experiment gone wrong. Fun fact: the sequel is set in the far-away future, a.k.a. 2015.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965)\n\nDirector: Robert Wise\n\nStars: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 83%\n\nFor fans of: sweet storylines and uplifting music\n\nJulie Andrews plays an Austrian nun during World War II in the Academy Award-winning film. When she comes to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children, she begins to realize how much the family means to her. The latter part of the movie has an unexpected twist and displays the unfathomable truth of what it was like living in Nazi Germany.\n\nwatch\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\n\nDirector: Milos Forman\n\nStars: Jake Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nFor fans of: memorable characters and tragic comedies\n\nJack Nicholson's at his best in this film about a habitual criminal who's sentenced to time in a mental hospital. There, he threatens the natural order under the watch of cruel Nurse Ratched and attempts to flee with his fellow patients. The film swept up five Academy Awards in its day, from Best Picture to Best Actor and Best Actress.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Graduate (1967)\n\nDirector: Mike Nichols\n\nStars: Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 87%\n\nFor fans of: love triangles and a moving score\n\nBetween the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack and the easy-on-the-eyes love triangle—Dustin Hoffman as a wandering college graduate, his married neighbor Mrs. Robinson, and her daughter—this film is hard to not immediately fall in love with.\n\nwatch\n\nRocky Horror Picture Show (1975)\n\nDirector: Jim Sharman\n\nStars: Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 78%\n\nFor fans of: wild characters and over-the-top dance numbers\n\nSee for yourself where all the live versions of the cult favorite Rocky Horror Picture Show began with this over-the-top, perfectly cast musical (see: young Susan Sarandon).\n\nwatch\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nStars: Judy Garland, Jack Haley, Ray Bolger\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nFor fans of: fantasy and flawless vocals\n\nA technical marvel at its time and one of the most influential films ever, this 1937 film is definitely worth a watch for movie buffs, even if you've seen countless iterations of L. Frank Baum's fairy tale.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Philadelphia Story (1940)\n\nDirector: George Cukor\n\nStars: Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nFor fans of: screwball comedies and love triangles\n\nOver 80 years after its release, this classic still deserves every bit of its perfect Rotten Tomatoes rating. Katharine Hepburn plays the headstrong socialite Tracy Lord, who spends the days leading up to her second wedding trading barbs with her ex-husband Dexter (Cary Grant) and James Stewart’s Mike, a journalist sent to cover the ceremony—leading her to reassess her decision to marry the social-climbing George Kittredge (John Howard). There’s still a wedding at the end of the movie, but we won’t spoil who ends up as the groom.\n\nwatch\n\nSingin’ in the Rain (1952)\n\nDirector: Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen\n\nStars: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O’Connor\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nFor fans of: musicals and Old Hollywood\n\nSingin’ in the Rain is still considered by many to be the greatest musical film of all time, more than 70 years later. Rightfully so—the rom-com is full of catchy songs and impressive dance sequences to tell the story of Hollywood’s not-so-smooth transition from silent films to “talkies.”\n\nwatch\n\nSeven Samurai (1956)\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nStars: Toshirô Mifune and Takashi Shimura\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 100%\n\nFor fans of: action epics and long runtimes\n\nIf you're an action fan and haven't watched Seven Samurai, odds are you've already seen countless references to Kurosawa's 1954 film. This story of a motley crew of samurai gathered to protect a small village from a major threat has gone on to inspire generations of filmmakers, including several who appear on this very list. Just be sure to carve out enough time to immerse yourself in the three-plus hour runtime.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Matrix (1999)\n\nDirector: Lana and Lilly Wachowski\n\nStars: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 85%\n\nFor fans of: mind-bending effects and leather trenches\n\nMany elements of The Matrix have escaped the screen to become mainstays in fashion and internet culture as a whole (for better or worse). Over 25 years after its release, Neo's (Reeves) escape from his simulated reality still has some of the best action scenes and visual effects ever put to film.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Best Scary Movies and Thriller Movies of All Time\n\nHorror and thriller films do something to us that no other genre of films do—they terrify us. Some people may think it’s crazy, but feeling a sense of fear, dread, and anticipation via movies is an adrenaline rush like no other.

Rightfully dubbed \"one of the best horror films ever made\" by many, The Exorcist goes above and beyond to make you terrified. The story about a girl possessed by a demon in need of an exorcism is unsettling, to say the least.\n\nwatch\n\nParasite (2019)\n\nDirector: Bong Joon Ho\n\nStars: Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-sik, Park So-dam\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 99%\n\nFor fans of: gruesome twists and commentaries on social issues\n\nAn unemployed family of four slips into the lives of the crazy wealthy Park family. Then, there's an incident that can’t entirely be cleaned up in a cleaning shift. Long after the credits roll, you’ll be questioning the ending and mulling over the tough, important themes.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nStars: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 82%\n\nFor fans of: Stephen King and eerie settings\n\nJack Nicholson is on this list a few times, but this classic horror movie is probably his most well-known role. The Torrance family—husband Jack, wife Wendy, and son Danny—are staying in the Overlook Hotel during the winter. Then, the hotel begins to come alive with a terrible, terrifying evil. Stephen King famously hated this adaptation, because Stanley Kubrick takes out all the empathy from the patriarch (Nicholson, playing crazy like he was born to do it). But it makes the story even more powerful. Viewed through today's lens, it's also a haunting look at the effects of domestic violence.\n\nwatch\n\nPromising Young Woman (2020)\n\nDirector: Emerald Fennell\n\nStars: Carey Mulligan, Laverne Cox, Bo Burnham\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 90%\n\nFor fans of: feminism and twisted revenge\n\nThis very dark comedy juxtaposes one woman's insatiable quest to avenge her best friend's tragic assault in front of a backdrop of all things frilly, pink, and sweet. That stark contrast only makes the movie's incredibly intense climax that much more shocking. Promising Young Woman was nominated for five Oscars in 2021, including Best Picture, Best Actress for Carey Mulligan, and a history-making Best Director nod for Emerald Fennell.\n\nwatch\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nStars: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 91%\n\nFor fans of: creepy villains and outer space\n\nThis movie is trippy and a bit hard to follow, but it's absolutely required viewing. Stanley Kubrick takes us from the dawn of the human species to the dawn of a totally new species in just a few hours, and his view of space and space travel set the standard for a thousand sci-fi films to come. More importantly, it's compelling and totally, totally terrifying. It's aged really well, despite being made over 50 years ago.\n\nwatch\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nStars: Grace Kelly, James Stewart, Wendell Corey\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nFor fans of: taut suspense and chilling endings\n\nThis early Hitchcock movie boasts an impressive 98% percent Rotten Tomatoes score, and it's still considered one of the best of its time. Starring Princess Grace Kelly and James Stewart, the film revolves around a man confined to his wheelchair whose pastime involves spying on his neighbors (through the rear window—get it?). Things take a turn for the worst when he believes he's witnessed a murder.\n\nwatch\n\nJurassic Park (1993)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nStars: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 92%\n\nFor fans of: monster movies and amusement parks\n\nIt's a little hard to believe that the Schindler's List director also came up with this dino adventure movie, but what's even more impressive is that the two films came out mere months apart. This could not be more different, but if you're looking for a film about these prehistoric creatures, stick to the classic. There's so much loving attention paid to the dinosaurs' look—there isn't a ton of CGI, with a greater reliance on practical effects—but more importantly, the human characters are just as interesting. Samuel L. Jackson, in the best cameo of all time.\n\nwatch\n\nHeathers (1988)\n\nDirector: Michael Lehmann\n\nStars: Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannen Doherty\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nFor fans of: twisted high school movies and campiness\n\nWinona Ryder's always in her element in off-beat dark comedies, and this one sets her in the middle of a high school where her character Veronica gets invited to a join a popular clique of \"Heathers\" (literally three girls whose names are Heather) until they betray her. Veronica and her partner-in-crime J.D. Dean (Christian Slater) set out to right all the wrongs made against her, in cruel and unusual ways.\n\nwatch\n\nTrain to Busan (2016)\n\nDirector: Yeon Sang-ho\n\nStars: Gong Yoo, Ma Dong-seok, Choi Woo-sik\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\nFor fans of: zombie horrors and Korean films\n\nIn this legendary Korean thriller, a group of travelers on a bullet train have to fight off a car full of zombies as a mysterious infection ravages the country. The pulse-pounding film has a stellar cast and a secret heart, with the characters making touch choices to help their families survive.\n\nwatch\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nStars: Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 96%\n\nFor fans of: slasher films and horror in the mundane\n\nOne of the first slasher films (that launched many copycats to come) is Alfred Hitchcock's creepy story of Norman Bates and his hotel on the hill.\n\nwatch\n\nCarrie (1976)\n\nDirector: Brian De Palma\n\nStars: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, William Katt\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 93%\n\nFor fans of: supernatural horror and revenge stories\n\nSissy Spacek is the one true Carrie—a bullied young woman who develops telekinetic abilities just in time for a prank prom invite to turn into a full-fledged bloodbath. I know we shouldn't condone violence, but it's hard not to root for poor Carrie after her classmates dump pigs blood on her in her prom dress, right?\n\nwatch\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nDirector: Jordan Peele\n\nStars: Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nFor fans of: psychological thrillers and comedic relief\n\nIt's not often that a movie so perfectly taps into the spirit of the times, but in a year where Trump's presidency sparked tense discussions about police brutality, race, and false liberalism, this was the breakout movie that did the job—in the horror genre, no less. Director Jordan Peele turns the typical horror script on its head with this blend of cultural criticism and horror tropes.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\nDirector: Jonathan Demme\n\nStars: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Lawrence A. Bonney\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 95%\n\nFor fans of: Psychological thrillers and charming cannibals\n\nAnthony Hopkins' performance in this film made Hannibal Lecter the creepiest villain of the past few decades, who isn't even the actual villain of this film. Lecter's influence is felt in many horror baddies who have come after, but there's nothing like hearing the original say \"fava beans and a nice Chianti.\"\n\nwatch\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nStars: Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Michael Caine\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\nFor fans of: crime thrillers and sinister villains\n\nFor many (myself included), Christopher Nolan's second installment in his superhero trilogy is the best Batman there is. Equal parts action blockbuster and crime thriller, Nolan is able to expertly combine aspects of both genres into a modern superhero film for the ages. Heath Ledger's go at the Joker is so massive and brilliant, so far no other actor has been able to top it.\n\nwatch\n\nSeven (1995)\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nStars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 82%\n\nFor fans of: detective stories and plot twist finales\n\nOne of the best crime thrillers of all time has to be David Fincher's Seven. With Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman at the helm, two detectives investigate a number of grisly murders inspired by the seven deadly sins, and boy, do things get dark. There's plenty of symbolism along the way for you to connect the dots, but still bet you'll be shocked by the now-memeable ending.\n\nwatch\n\nBlack Swan (2010)\n\nDirector: Darren Aronofsky\n\nStars: Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 85%\n\nFor fans of: ballet and jumpscares\n\nWho says ballet can’t be scary? Natalie Portman plays Nina, a professional ballerina who increasingly loses her grip on reality as she’s forced to compete with Mila Kunis’ Lily for the lead role in a production of Swan Lake. This psychological thriller explores the (very) dark side of devotion to one’s art, and it won Portman the Best Actress award at the 2011 Oscars.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Best Drama Movies of All Time\n\nMovies that fall under the drama genre are exactly what the name suggests: dramatic. The list of films that can be considered a drama is long and varied. Anything from period pieces, teen dramas, war movies, movies for girls' night, biopics, etc, fall under the drama category, but what they all have in common is emotionally driven characters and plenty of conflict.\n\nLife is Beautiful (1997)\n\nDirector: Roberto Benigni\n\nStars: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 81%\n\nFor fans of: World War II stories and bittersweet humor\n\nWhile this Italian film is about the horrors of the Holocaust, it has plenty of comic moments as well—and it works. Roberto Benigni gives a breathtaking performance as a family man who, as a Jew, is sent with his family to a concentration camp in northern Italy, but uses his imaginative powers to convince his young son that it's all a game.\n\nwatch\n\nErin Brockovich (2001)\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nStars: Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 85%\n\nFor fans of: legal dramas and uncovering corruption\n\nThis inspiring drama stars Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich, a single mom who uncovers an environmental crime and goes after the huge corporation involved.\n\nwatch\n\nDead Poets Society (1989)\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\n\nStars: Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 84%\n\nFor fans of: inspirational stories\n\nSet at a New England private school in 1959, this movie follows an English teacher, played by Robin Williams, and his relationship with his students as he teaches them to live a little more through poetry. The movie gave Williams his second Oscar nominee, and Ethan Hawke said that working on this movie inspired him to continue to be an actor.\n\nwatch\n\nSchindler's List (1993)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nStars: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nFor fans of: chilling historical periods and brutal atmospheres\n\nA movie about the Holocaust is almost guaranteed to be poignant, but under Stephen Spielberg's expert direction, this one surprises with its restraint. That's deliberate—the sadness and symbolism build throughout the film so that you have a full sense of what happened, who did it, and why it matters so, so much. The movie's in black and white, with the smallest pop of color to offer a moment of hope and then (devastatingly) all possible heartbreak in one unforgettable image.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Farewell (2019)\n\nDirector: Lulu Wang\n\nStars: Awkwafina, Tzi Ma, Diana Lin\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 97%\n\nFor fans of: complicated family dynamics and cultural traditions\n\nIn her Golden Globe-winning role, Awkwafina plays Billi, a woman on a trip to China for a \"family wedding\" that's actually a final goodbye to her grandmother. While there, Billi struggles to find a deeper connection to the country and tries to understand her family's decision to keep her grandmother's sickness a secret from her.\n\nwatch\n\nLady Bird (2017)\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nStars: Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Timothée Chalamet\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 99%\n\nFor fans of: coming-of-age stories and mother-daughter drama\n\nGreta Gerwig dives into the tricky dynamics of mother-daughter relationships in this coming-of-age story. Saoirse Ronan plays the titular Lady Bird, a teen navigating her last year at her Catholic high school. Gerwig paints a portrait of adolescence that's poignant, genuine, and hilarious.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Truman Show (1998)\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\n\nStars: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 95%\n\nFor fans of: reality TV and cautionary tales\n\nIf you've ever wondered whether your life is just one big sitcom, The Truman Show illustrates what happens when one man, played by Jim Carrey, realizes that his entire life is scripted for television. While that premise seems pretty straightforward, there's a lot of deeper messaging about narcissism, surveillance, media, and what it means to have free will.\n\nwatch\n\nMoonlight (2016)\n\nDirector: Barry Jenkins\n\nStars: Mahershala Ali, Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nFor fans of: Lgbtq+ themes and forbidden love\n\nYes, you've heard the buzz about this movie. But if you haven't seen it yet, make room in your schedule. Moonlight is a beautifully filmed coming-of-age story of a gay black boy growing up in a housing project in Miami. The many-layered film sheds light on aspects of Black identity that are rarely spotlighted on film.\n\nwatch\n\nDaughters of the Dust (1991)\n\nDirector: Julie Dash\n\nStars: Kaycee Moore, Cora Lee Day, Barbara O.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\nFor fans of: multi-generational families and African culture\n\nQuick history lesson: Daughters of the Dust was the first feature film directed by a Black woman distributed in theaters in the U.S. It tells the story of three generations of Gullah women in pre-Civil War times living on Saint Helena Island who are stuck on deciding whether to stay or migrate north for a better life. The film's scenery is stunning, but the real beauty of the film is its complex characters.\n\nwatch\n\nHer (2013)\n\nDirector: Spike Jonze\n\nStars: Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Scarlett Johansson\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 94%\n\nFor fans of: unexpected love and sci-fi twists\n\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers as the sensitive Theodore, a man who writes personal letters for others. After a bitter divorce, he soon develops a friendly (and later romantic) relationship with an intuitive operating system. It may be an unusual relationship, but the film shows that love comes in many forms.\n\nwatch\n\nLittle Women (2019)\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nStars: Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timothée Chalamet\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 95%\n\nFor fans of: female leads and double endings\n\nGerwig's adaption of Louisa May Alcott's novel is nothing short of stunning. Each March sister is determined to live their own lives and it's fascinating to see how they each carve their own path. Gerwig's autumnal color palette and New England scenery will make you want to curl up on the couch and get cozy while shedding a tear a two.\n\nwatch\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nDirector: Ang Lee\n\nStars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Linda Cardellini\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 88%\n\nFor fans of: doomed love and tearjerkers\n\nSet in 1963 Wyoming, cowboys Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (Heath Ledger) discover deep feelings for each other while on a sheep herding job on Brokeback Mountain.

There he meets friends and enemies and learns a new way of life incarcerated.\n\nwatch\n\nWest Side Story (1961)\n\nDirector: Jerome Robbins, Robert Wise\n\nStars: Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Rita Moreno\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 92%\n\nFor fans of: rivalries and impeccable dancing\n\nIf you liked the Steven Spielberg remake, be sure to also check out the original film adaptation of this Romeo-and-Juliet inspired musical, starring Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood.\n\nwatch\n\nThe Big Sick (2017)\n\nDirector: Michael Showalter\n\nStars: Kumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Holly Hunter\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 98%\n\nFor fans of: real-life love stories and cross-cultural issues\n\nKumail Nanjiani wrote and stars in The Big Sick, the real-life story of how Nanjiani met and fell in love with his wife, Emily.

That mantra is on stark display in The Social Network, which charts the meteoric rise of Facebook from Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room to billions of devices around the world—and the relationships that broke down along the way."
