        "text": "Alfred Hitchcock uses a combination of film techniques to build suspense in his film, Psycho. Most notably, the dramatic score permeates the entirety of the film. The score is dark, haunting, and ominous. The audience is conditioned to recognize that something horrible is going to happen when that music is played. Without the use of the score, the film would be less dramatic and suspenseful.\n\nHitchcock also incorporated a variety of shots to create suspense. There were three extreme close-up shots used before, during, and after Marion’s murder, that I found particularly interesting. The first was the close up of Norman’s eye as he looked through the peep hole as Marion was undressing. The second was the shower drain shot as the mixture of water and Marion’s blood fell into it. This shot then dissolved into an extreme close-up of Marion’s dead, non-blinking eye. I thought these shots did a great job to break up the continuity of the film and dramatize this pivotal scene.\n\nThe shot of Norman’s eye as he spied on Marion touched on the theme of voyeurism that Hitchcock explored in his film, Rear Window. He knew exactly what he was doing looking through the peep hole, which implied he had done this many times before. The other shot of the water going down the drain added a sense of despair and hopelessness, as Marion’s blood slowly drained out of her body. The blood that gave her life washed down the drain as if it were nothing but dirty shower water. The third shot of Marion’s eye was particularly unsettling, because you are waiting for it to blink, but it never does. At first, I thought it was another shot of Norman’s eye, but as the camera pans out you realize it belongs to Marion. I thought that Hitchcock could be making a connection between Norman’s eye, the blood being washed down the drain, and Marion’s unblinking, creepy eye. The three of these extreme close-ups are connected, and perhaps this sequence of events had occurred with the other women that were killed at the Bates Motel.\n\nBy drawing a parallel between Norman’s spying eye to the bloody shower drain and Marion’s dead eye, it implies he has more of a connection to these events then he lets on at first. This connection makes sense at the conclusion of the movie, when it is revealed that Norman’s mother has been dead for years and he has been the one committing the murders when he takes on her personality. Norman had a psychiatric breakdown which drove him to murder his mother and her lover years ago. To cope with his guilt, Norman preserved his mother’s corpse and acted like she was still alive and living with him. Norman made a profound statement in the beginning of the movie during his first talk with Marion, about feeling trapped by his problems: “No one really runs away from anything. It’s like a private trap that holds us in like a prison. You know what I think? I think that we’re all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out. We scratch and we claw, but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.” Norman feels he cannot get away from his problems, he goes on to say that he was born into his trap. In retrospect, this statement foreshadows Norman’s involvement in the murders, as opposed to his being a mere accomplice."
