        "text": "June 7, 2021\n\nNew results from the Dark Energy Survey use the largest-ever sample of galaxies over an enormous piece of the sky to produce the most precise measurements of the universe’s composition and growth to date. Over the course of six years, DES surveyed 5,000 square degrees – almost one-eighth of the entire sky – in 758 nights of observation, cataloging hundreds of millions of objects.\n\nRead more about the research.\n\nMarch 26, 2020\n\nThe National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are joining C3.ai, Microsoft Corporation, and research institutions across the country as part of the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute. The announcement of this institute was made in The New York Times.\n\nThis new institute, a multi-disciplinary effort focused on artificial intelligence and advanced computing, will initially accept proposals related to the abatement of COVID-19, and mitigating risks from future pandemics using AI.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAugust 2, 2019\n\nNCSA announced a new collaboration between the Blue Waters Project, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the University of Minnesota and The Ohio State University to produce digital elevation models (DEM) of the entire Earth, among other geospatial research projects.\n\nThe collaboration makes Blue Waters the most powerful dedicated, non-classified geospatial system in the world.\n\nRead more about the collaboration here.\n\nFebruary 11, 2016\n\nScientists observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves, arriving at the earth from a cataclysmic event. This confirmed a major prediction of Albert Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity.\n\nGravitational waves carry information about their origins and about the nature of gravity. Physicists have concluded that the detected gravitational waves were produced during the final moments of the merger of two black holes.\n\nRead more about the discovery here.\n\nJanuary 1, 2013\n\nBlue Waters is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world and is one of the fastest supercomputers on a university campus. Scientists and engineers across the country use the computing and data power of Blue Waters to tackle a wide range of challenging problems, from predicting the behavior of complex biological systems to simulating the evolution of the cosmos.\n\nRead more about Blue Waters and the research it enables here.\n\nJanuary 1, 2011\n\nThe Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is a powerful collection of integrated digital resources and services—things like supercomputers, visualization and storage systems, collections of data, software, networks, and expert support—that scientists, engineers, social scientists, and humanities experts around the world use to advance understanding of our world and to make our lives healthier, safer, and better. XSEDE integrates these resources and services, makes them easier to use, and helps more people use them. The five-year, $121 million project is supported by the National Science Foundation and led by NCSA.\n\nRead more about XSEDE here.\n\nMarch 17, 2010\n\n“Hubble 3D” takes viewers through distant galaxies as it tells the story of the repair and upgrade of the Hubble telescope. While most of the film is shot with IMAX 3D cameras, including live-action footage from the space shuttle, nearly a quarter of the movie’s run time is devoted to NCSA Advanced Visualization Lab’s two dramatic voyages. Comprising nearly 10 minutes of the 43-minute film, the sequences use real Hubble, astronomical, and computational data in visualizations that make audiences feel they are on a space journey.\n\nNCSA’s Advanced Visualization Laboratory used their dedicated visualization cluster and the center’s Abe supercomputer to develop and render the two scenes for the Hubble 3D project. The AVL cluster and the Abe supercomputer both use 64-bit Linux machines, with each machine having eight cores and 16 gigabytes of memory, comparable to a high-end PC or Mac such as a graphics designer might use.\n\nRead more about how AVL achieved this here.\n\nMarch 10, 2006\n\nIt’s a simple little virus—so simple that biologists often refer to it as a “particle” rather than an organism, so small and primitive that it can only proliferate in a cell that’s already been hijacked by another virus. But a recent simulation of the satellite tobacco mosaic virus is also a striking first. There’s never been a computer simulation of an entire life form in atomic detail. Until now.\n\nRead about the research here.\n\nNovember 8, 2004\n\nThe TV series ‘NOVA’ focused on the search for understanding nature’s most violent tornadoes, from daredevil storm chasing in tornado alley to simulating severe weather with the computational resources and visualization expertise of NCSA at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n“Hunt for the Supertwister” was aired nationally on PBS stations across the country. The show featured data-driven tornado visualizations produced by NCSA’s Experimental Technologies Division.\n\nRead more here.\n\nMay 27, 2003\n\nWhen Sony released the Linux Kit for the PlayStation® 2 (PS2) game console, interest in the machines spread beyond the gaming community to a seemingly unlikely place: the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.\n\nResearchers at NCSA theorized that because of the unique processor of the PS2, a cluster of consoles could potentially be used for scientific computation.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAugust 9, 2001\n\nThe National Science Foundation has awarded $53 million to four U.S. research institutions to build and deploy a distributed terascale facility. The DTF will be the largest, most comprehensive infrastructure ever deployed for scientific research—with more than 13.6 teraflops (trillions of calculations per second) of computing power as well as facilities capable of managing and storing more than 450 terabytes (trillions of bytes) of data.\n\nRead more about TeraGrid here.\n\nAugust 31, 1999\n\nMarked the first time usage of a National Science Foundation high-performance computer topped one million normalized CPU hours in one month. According to figures from Quantum Research, which measures computer usage at NSF-support sites, NCSA’s 1,536-processor SGI Origin2000 supercomputer provided 1,136,676 normalized CPU hours to 736 national users in August, tripling the usage from August 1998. A normalized CPU hour is equivalent to a Cray X-MP processor hour, based on standard benchmarks.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNovember 2, 1998\n\nAt the height of the tech surge that marked the late 1998, Newsweek asked: “Can any place ever hope to match the awesome success of Silicon Valley?” It then proceeded to answer its own question by rattling off 10 metro areas that might someday fit the bill. Champaign-Urbana—thanks in no small part to NCSA, which was featured in the article—made the cut.\n\nRead more here.\n\nJanuary 3, 1993\n\nPeople had created Web browsers before. Prior to anyone at NCSA putting down a line of code, researchers in Palo Alto and Berkeley and Helsinki were circulating their own versions of browsers, frequently with melodious names like Viola and Cello.\n\nNCSA Mosaic broke out in a way that no previous browser had even begun to. It stood on the shoulders of giant ideas and became a giant in its own right.\n\nMore about the Mosaic Web Browser\n\nJanuary 10, 1992\n\nDavid Herron of Eli Lilly and Company harnessed high-performance computing to aid the fight against asthma from the moment the company joined NCSA’s Industrial Program, now the Private Sector Program, in 1987. Herron and the Lilly research team studied a class of small molecules known as leukotrienes, which cause the lungs to stiffen and become irritated. Lilly’s goal was to develop receptor antagonists that recognize receptors in the lungs, bind to them, and block the leukotrienes. In other words, they wanted to build something that looked enough like the leukotrienes that a receptor accepts it but different enough that it doesn’t trigger a reaction.\n\nRead more here.\n\nJanuary 15, 1991\n\nMummies don’t make their way to Central Illinois that often; when one does, you hate to destroy it while unraveling its secrets. The University of Illinois’ World Heritage Museum received a donated Egyptian mummy in 1989. An interdisciplinary team, including NCSA, then worked to better understand the mummification process and to determine the mummy’s age, sex, medical history, and cause of death.\n\nRead more here.\n\nJanuary 16, 1986\n\nResponding to a ‘famine’ of supercomputing power for U.S. researchers, Illinois astrophysicist Larry Smarr and seven Illinois colleagues submitted an unsolicited proposal to the National Science Foundation, asking for funding to launch supercomputing centers. NSF responded in 1985 by establishing the National Center for Supercomputing Applications with Smarr as its first director. NCSA “opened for business” early in 1986."
