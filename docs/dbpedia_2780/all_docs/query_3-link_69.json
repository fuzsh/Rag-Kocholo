        "text": "1 / 100\n\nA24\n\n#100. Moonlight (2016)\n\n- Director: Barry Jenkins\n\n- Stacker score: 90.1\n\n- Metascore: 99\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.4\n\n- Runtime: 111 minutes\n\nDivided into three segments, this prescient drama follows young Chiron (Ashton Sanders) on his path to self-discovery. Brought to life with vivid color and precision, the story grapples with themes of poverty and identity. \"Moonlight\" won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Mahershala Ali made history as the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar.\n\n2 / 100\n\nBiBi Film\n\n#99. The Best of Youth (2003)\n\n- Director: Marco Tullio Giordana\n\n- Stacker score: 90.6\n\n- Metascore: 89\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Runtime: 366 minutes\n\n\"The Best of Youth\" follows middle-class Italian brothers Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) over nearly 40 years, as they come of age and search for meaning amid post-World War II upheaval. Because of its lengthy runtime, the film was released as a pair of three-hour films. It won the \"Prize Un Certain Regard\" at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. As film critic Peter Bradshaw notes, \"The Best of Youth\" is a notable example of Italian films that track history through an extensive family saga. Other examples include \"The Leopard\" and \"Rocco and His Brothers.\"\n\n3 / 100\n\n1+2 Seisaku Iinkai\n\n#98. Yi Yi (2000)\n\n- Director: Edward Yang\n\n- Stacker score: 90.6\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 173 minutes\n\nThis generational Taiwanese drama follows the plight of engineer NJ (Wu Nien-jen), and how his actions affect three generations of his middle-class family. Director Edward Yang received particular acclaim for \"Yi Yi,\" taking home Best Director at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival for the film. Its Chinese title can be translated to the phrase \"one by one,\" or \"one after another.\"\n\n4 / 100\n\nRizzoli Film\n\n#97. Umberto D. (1952)\n\n- Director: Vittorio De Sica\n\n- Stacker score: 90.6\n\n- Metascore: 92\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.2\n\n- Runtime: 89 minutes\n\nIn this Italian film, elderly Rome resident Umberto Domenico Ferrari (Carlo Battisti) and his beloved dog Flike face eviction and the prospect of poverty. Desperate to evade threats from his landlady (Lina Gennari), Domenico fakes illness in order to stay at his hospital, leaving Flike behind with the landlady's compassionate maid. Although Italians found the movie too critical so soon after World War II, it's since attained a legacy as one of the great Italian films.\n\n5 / 100\n\nCinédis\n\n#96.

The movie was an inspiration for Martin Scorsese when making \"Goodfellas,\" as he admired its \"punk attitude.\"\n\n6 / 100\n\nKurosawa Production Co.\n\n#95.

Loosely based on the true story of the Souain corporals affair of 1915, \"Paths of Glory\" was initially censored in several places—such as Switzerland and France—for its critique of the casual cruelty of war.\n\nYou may also like: Best films turning 50 in 2024\n\n11 / 100\n\nAmazon Studios\n\n#90.

Kicking the film off on a high note is a six-minute song-and-dance number that goes down in the middle of freeway traffic. Filming the scene took two days and involved stitching three consecutive shots together to create what appeared to be a single take. Among the movie's 14 Academy Award nominations, Stone took home the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal in the film, and Damien Chazelle for Best Director, making him the youngest winner at 32.\n\n15 / 100\n\nTwentieth Century-Fox Productions\n\n#86.

It's about a young prince who's doomed to exist as a beast unless he can earn the love of his captive and thereby reverse the spell.

Based on Joseph Kessel's 1943 book of the same name, \"Army of Shadows\" wasn't originally hailed as the great war film it is today.

The film was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won six of them, which ties it with \"Titanic\" and \"La La Land\" for the most Oscar nominations in Hollywood history. \"All About Eve\" became one of the first 50 movies chosen by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n74 / 100\n\nDaiei Motion Picture Company\n\n#27.

In the film, The Tramp struggles to make ends meet in a highly industrialized world, famously slithering his way through the gears of a machine during one of the era's most epochal scenes. Chaplin was reportedly inspired to make the film after talking about machinery and technology with Mahatma Gandhi. \"Modern Times\" was one of the earliest films chosen by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1989.\n\n83 / 100\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\n#18.

The movie stars Cary Grant as a New York ad executive, who gets caught up in the world of international espionage after being mistaken for a notorious spy. What follows is an epic struggle for survival, which culminates with a deadly showdown on Mount Rushmore.

In the film, a series of miscommunications lead to a nuclear showdown between the world's most powerful nations. As intentionally ridiculous as the movie is, an early version of the script was even more so, with aliens watching the whole fiasco from space. The film garnered four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director.\n\n85 / 100\n\nBarunson E&A\n\n#16.

Debbie Reynolds co-stars in her breakthrough role as Kathy Selden. In 1989, the movie became one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n87 / 100\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#14.

In telling the story of a murderous hotel owner, Alfred Hitchcock relied on everything from quick cuts to gripping music to a shape-shifting narrative, thereby delivering a completely new cinematic experience. To this day, the famous shower scene is among the most important sequences in movie history. The film was also nominated for four Oscars, and won Janet Leigh the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n88 / 100\n\nStudio Ghibli\n\n#13.

The movie follows 10-year-old Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi), who finds herself in a fantasy world ruled by gods and monsters, as she fights to reclaim her identity and reunite with her parents. It became the first non-English language hand-drawn film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.\n\n89 / 100\n\nHorizon Pictures (II)\n\n#12.

Vertigo (1958)\n\n- Director: Alfred Hitchcock\n\n- Stacker score: 95.3\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.3\n\n- Runtime: 128 minutes\n\nNothing is as it seems in \"Vertigo,\" an Alfred Hitchcock classic based on Boileau-Narcejac's 1954 novel \"D'entre les morts\" (\"From Among the Dead\"). In the film, a former police detective (James Stewart) is hired to trail a friend's wife (Kim Novak) who's been acting strangely and may be at risk of harming herself. The otherwise mundane gig goes haywire as the private investigator becomes obsessed with the woman and Hitchcock shares his most revelatory, personal production of his career. The classic Hitchcock film was preserved in the National Film Registry in 1989.\n\n91 / 100\n\nRKO Radio Pictures\n\n#10. Citizen Kane (1941)\n\n.- Director: Orson Welles\n\n- Stacker score: 95.3\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.3\n\n- Runtime: 119 minutes\n\nHere's a movie so great that when something else is likewise terrific, that thing is often referred to as the \"Citizen Kane\" of its respective arena. Accordingly, this 1941 film—which depicts the ambitious rise of newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles)—has only gotten better with age. It might no longer retain the #1 spot on lists of the greatest films, including this one, but ask the right cinephiles, and they will likely assert \"Citizen Kane\" is still the best movie of them all. Despite garnering nine Academy Awards, the film only walked away with one, for Best Original Screenplay.\n\n92 / 100\n\nMiramax\n\n#9. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\n- Director: Quentin Tarantino\n\n- Stacker score: 95.3\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.9\n\n- Runtime: 154 minutes\n\nQuentin Tarantino's second directorial effort arguably remains his most quintessential work.

In 2013, \"Pulp Fiction\" was chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n93 / 100\n\nCharles Chaplin Productions\n\n#8. City Lights (1931)\n\n- Director: Charles Chaplin\n\n- Stacker score: 95.8\n\n- Metascore: 99\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Runtime: 87 minutes\n\nSticking to his well-established roots, Charlie Chaplin released this primarily silent film three years into the talkie era. Rife with signature pantomime, it follows The Tramp (Chaplin) as he resorts to various extremes while trying to make a buck. It all paves the way for one of cinema's most unforgettable final scenes, during which the story's underlying pathos is laid bare. Hailed as being one of the greatest and most inspiring films, \"City Lights\" went on to be preserved by the Library of Congress in the National Film Registry in 1991.\n\n94 / 100\n\nToho Company\n\n#7.

It's also known for its centerpiece battle, when 40 bandits attack the central village.\n\n95 / 100\n\nUniversal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment\n\n#6. Schindler's List (1993)\n\n- Director: Steven Spielberg\n\n- Stacker score: 95.8\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 9\n\n- Runtime: 195 minutes\n\nWhile Steven Spielberg was no stranger to serious fare by the early 1990s, he nevertheless caught audiences by surprise when he released this award-winning drama. It tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who ultimately saved 1,100 Jewish lives during the Holocaust. Spielberg forewent a salary when making the film, and donated the profits to a charitable foundation. The movie was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, winning seven, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n96 / 100\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\n#5. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)\n\n- Director: Peter Jackson\n\n- Stacker score: 95.8\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 9\n\n- Runtime: 201 minutes\n\nIn the final installment of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, the forces of good and evil do battle over the fate of Middle Earth, while Frodo reaches the last leg of his journey. Not only did the film earn more than $1 billion dollars at the box office, but it won 11 Academy Awards out of 11 nominations, giving it the highest perfect score in Oscar history. It also tied with \"Ben-Hur\" and \"Titanic\" for the film with the most Oscar wins.\n\n97 / 100\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#4. Rear Window (1954)\n\n- Director: Alfred Hitchcock\n\n- Stacker score: 96.4\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Runtime: 112 minutes\n\nIn addition to striking the perfect balance of intrigue and suspense, this 1954 Hitchcock film endures through its perennial relatability. After all, who hasn't wondered what their neighbor might be up to behind closed doors? In \"Rear Window,\" the answer is potentially murder. Or is a wheelchair-bound James Stewart simply letting his paranoia get the best of him? To say anything more is to spoil the fun of watching this classic for the first time. The movie earned four Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n98 / 100\n\nPopperfoto // Getty Images\n\n#3. Casablanca (1942)\n\n- Director: Michael Curtiz\n\n- Stacker score: 96.4\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Runtime: 102 minutes\n\nThis 1942 masterwork takes place in the Moroccan town of Casablanca, where jaded nightclub owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) helps refugees flee to America to evade Nazi capture. After Blaine's former flame (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband shows up seeking his help, he finds himself entering a world of trouble.\n\nMost cinephiles would argue \"Casablanca\" is the result of a perfect screenplay. Yet, when that very same screenplay was passed around under a different name in the 1980s, professional readers chastised it for having too much dialog and not enough sex. Nevertheless, the film claimed three of the eight Oscars for which it was nominated, including Best Director and Best Screenplay.\n\n99 / 100\n\nOrion-Nova Productions\n\n#2. 12 Angry Men (1957)\n\n- Director: Sidney Lumet\n\n- Stacker score: 96.9\n\n- Metascore: 96\n\n- IMDb user rating: 9\n\n- Runtime: 96 minutes\n\nIn this taut 1957 drama from Sidney Lumet, 12 jurors determine the fate of a suspected murderer. What starts as an open-and-shut case becomes something far more complex, as a lone holdout convinces the others that the defendant might not be guilty after all. As the debate unfolds, each juror's own respective prejudices bubble to the surface, with all the action taking place inside the jury room. In 2007, the film was chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\n100 / 100\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#1. The Godfather (1972)\n\n- Director: Francis Ford Coppola\n\n- Stacker score: 100\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 9.2\n\n- Runtime: 175 minutes\n\nStanley Kubrick himself used to reluctantly theorize that \"The Godfather\" was the greatest movie ever made, and most audiences and critics agree. Chronicling the exploits of the Corleone crime family, this 1972 masterpiece delivers everything one could ask for in a film, fusing elements of drama, violence, and suspense to absolute perfection. Indeed, there's virtually no aspect of \"The Godfather\" that doesn't remain iconic to this day, hence its status as the best movie of all time. The film had a huge turnout at the 45th Academy Awards, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nYou may also like: Most popular movies on Apple TV+ this week\n\nRead First\n\nStacker believes in making the world’s data more accessible through storytelling.
