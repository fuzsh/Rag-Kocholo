        "text": "Ear­li­er this week, we fea­tured a list of Quentin Taran­ti­no’s 12 Favorite Films of All Time, giv­en in response to Sight & Sound’s 2012 poll. This morn­ing, one of our friend­ly fol­low­ers on Twit­ter (@LoSceicco1976) made us aware of anoth­er list — a hand­writ­ten list that Taran­ti­no appar­ent­ly sub­mit­ted in 2008, to Empire Mag­a­zine. Do the two lists have some com­mon­al­i­ties? Yup, Taxi Dri­ver, His Girl Fri­day, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, etc. But this hand­writ­ten list also includes a num­ber of new titles — take for exam­ple, Chang-hwa Jeong’s Five Fin­gers of Death, Bri­an De Pal­ma’s Blow Out, and Howard Hawks’ Rio Bra­vo, star­ring John Wayne. (See our col­lec­tion of 21 Free John Wayne West­erns here.) And, sor­ry to say, The Bad News Bears did­n’t make the cut.\n\nIt just goes to show, if you ask direc­tors to jot down their favorite movies, the list can change from day to day, and year to year. Speak­ing of, you might also want to see a video where Taran­ti­no Lists His Favorite Films Since 1992. Yet more new films to save for a rainy day.\n\nIf you would like to sign up for Open Culture’s free email newslet­ter, please find it here.
