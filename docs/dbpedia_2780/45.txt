Among a slew of announcements at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Comics revealed a new X-Treme X-Men limited series by the legendary creative team of Chris Claremont and Salvador Larocca, set in the era of their original run (2001-2004).

Now, the publisher has revealed more than a dozen variant covers to celebrate the new series, spread across its current flagship titles.

In addition to reuniting Claremont and Larocca, the new X-Treme X-Men limited series also reunites the X-Treme team of Bishop, Sage, Gambit, Rogue, Rachel Summers, Storm, and Wolverine. And although the series is set in the past, Marvel's solicitation text for the first issue teases that it will "have wide-reaching implications for some of your favorite X-characters" in the current Marvel Universe.

Below, see 15 of Marvel's X-Treme variant covers, featuring all the most extreme elements of comics from the '90s and '00s, followed by the full schedule of all 19 covers that will be available in November.
