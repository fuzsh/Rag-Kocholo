Meet Kaitlynn Goulette, a 14-year-old Westfield resident, astronomer, club founder, author, and student. Her family’s passion for astronomy quickly became hers from a young age. Kaitlynn is an ambitious student who founded her own astronomy club for Westfield Middle School, the first ever student-led club. Her dream is to have a telescope in every school in Westfield so students can take them home and drift off into the stars.

Kaitlynn decided to make her dreams a reality by reaching out to Westfield Gas + Electric for a $500 donation. Westfield Gas + Electric happily donated to fund Kaitlynn’s dream and WG+E encouraged others to donate as well. WG+E is an active member in the Westfield community that invests back into the people they serve. WG+E powers their community, so the sky is always the limit for Westfield residents.

Franklin Ave. Elementary teamed up with Westfield's YMCA to bring the Safety Around Water program to all second graders, and through the help of a grant and local sponsorships, this fantastic initiative has been going on strong! The YMCA's experienced instructors help children learn the vital life skill of staying safe around water, which is especially important for families who might not have regular access to swimming facilities. Plus, it's a great way for the kids to have some fun with their classmates outside the usual classroom setting!
