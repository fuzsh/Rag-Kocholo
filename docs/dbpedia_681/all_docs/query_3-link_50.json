        "text": "MAYOR'S UPDATE:\n\nNOVEMBER 12\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us yesterday for a beautiful and moving ceremony to honor our veterans. I am very grateful to the Martin Wallberg American Legion Post 3, not just for organizing this annual event, but for their ongoing dedication to our veterans throughout the year. If you missed it, the replay of the ceremony is available on the Town’s Facebook page.\n\nReady or not, the holiday season is quickly approaching! We are preparing for some wonderful festivities in our Downtown, which you can read about in more detail below. As the season of giving draws near, please remember our local businesses, who have weathered an unprecedented 18 months and rely very heavily on this time of year. And it’s easier than ever this year with a newly introduced Downtown Westfield gift card! Let’s all commit to doing our part to keep our holiday spending in Westfield as much as possible.\n\nWishing you all a great weekend!\n\nPOLICE UPDATE\n\nEarlier this week, I met with Chief Battiloro, Town Administrator Jim Gildea, and Councilman Dardia who Chairs the Public Safety, Transportation, and Parking Committee, as part of our ongoing discussions regarding police activity. This included an updated look at regional crime trends and public policy, as well as an evaluation of our current police resources and Nixle alert practices.\n\nWhile there is of course a level of personal responsibility expected from residents in securing their own property, this is not and never has been our exclusive area of focus in crime deterrence. As residents are asked to do their part, we continue to do ours by exploring all possible avenues to address this issue. We are in the process of working on an updated, three-pronged approach centered on emphasizing policy reform at the state level through coalition building efforts, securing additional resources and pursuing innovative new technology to further assist the Police Department, and implementing a more streamlined communication strategy -- all of which need to work together to meet our shared goal of reducing crime and improving public safety for the community. I will provide updates on these efforts as they are implemented. In the meantime, please be assured that we continue to prioritize the use of all available resources in our approach to public safety.\n\nYou can read more detail about police activity in the weekly Police Blotter, which is posted every Tuesday on the Westfield Police Department’s website, as well as on the Westfield Police Department’s Facebook and Instagram pages.\n\nDOWNTOWN HOLIDAY EVENTS\n\nThe DWC has been busy planning for a fabulous holiday season! On Wednesday night, Westfield resident Les Trent and I spoke on Facebook Live with DWC Executive Director Bob Zuckerman and DWC Promotions Committee Chair Erin Ben-Hayon about this year’s exciting line up. In addition to the annual Christmas Tree Lighting (Sunday, November 28) and Menorah Lighting (Monday, November 29), this year will also bring Santa to town for selfies with the kids (December 12), as well as the return of the ice sculpture display throughout the downtown area (December 5), the Miracle on Elm Street raffles, and the Holiday Visitors Center -- this year, at the North Avenue train station!\n\nAnd, to help keep your holiday gifting local, make sure you pick up a new Downtown Westfield Gift Card, which is redeemable at a number of our local businesses. For full details on all of these events, visit the DWC's website."
