        "text": "Student achiever news from: Ithaca College, Lebanon Valley College, North Plainfield Public Schools, Polytech High School, Readington Township School District, SCVTHS, Westfield Public Schools\n\nThe program launched by Tamaques librarian Christine Pitarresi aims to help students to embrace creative thinking and problem-solving\n\nPrudential visits NPHS AP/Honors calculus students\n\nStudent tours set to begin for Polytech High School\n\nSomerset County Sheriff's K-9 unit visits SCVTHS\n\nWith the objective of fostering students' critical thinking, imagination and creativity, Westfield Public School librarian Christine Pitarresi has spearheaded a new program at Tamaques Elementary, called \"Makerspace.\"\n\nObserving current trends and needs for growing minds, Pitarresi enthusiastically noted, \"We used to be a society of makers, now we are becoming a society of consumers...we need our students to embrace creative thinking and problem solving again.\"\n\nWith the support of Principal David Duelks, funds from the Tamaques PTO, and a grant from the Education Fund of Westfield, Pitarresi launched Makerspace. Students in all grades 1 to 5 will cycle through Makerspace during lunch sessions.\n\nEntering a transformed library, the students can choose between several stations. For now, there is a full Lego wall with specialized engineering-related challenges, creative building stations with goal-based projects and an iPad-based station to guide students through drawing techniques.\n\n“It’s fun and we’re able to create stuff,” said fourth-grader Bianca Vesuna.\n\nAlthough Makerspace has already received a positive welcome, Pitarresi is not sitting on her laurels. Her ideas for projects later in the year include iPad-enabled animation with specialized green screens and experiments with electric circuitry.\n\nDuelks is thrilled with the outcome. \"We have succeeded in providing an environment where our kids can have a blast while expanding their problem-solving skills,\" he said. \"I wish I had that when I was a kid!\"\n\nBASF Corp. funds N.J. schools\n\nBASF Corp. awarded 20 New Jersey public schools $5,000 each to support science education programs in 12 of the 21 counties in the state. The awarded grants aim to enhance science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related initiatives for students, grades K-12, according to a news release.\n\n“Our goal is to develop and engage students in science so they can discover and innovate solutions to shape our future,” said Robin Rotenberg, vice president and chief communications officer for North America at BASF Corp. “Through these grants, we are giving our educators the tools they need to enhance their teaching in the classroom. BASF hopes to encourage students to view science as a long-term field of study and possible career path.”\n\nEach year BASF invites all New Jersey public schools to submit a proposal summarizing their specific science education needs and how a grant would help students explore STEM. This year, the company received 118 proposals from 20 counties.\n\nPast recipients have used their grants to advance learning about the environment, robotics and technology. In 2015, John P. Stevens High School in Edison built a greenhouse to educate students about the importance of our ecosystem, while also providing horticultural therapy to disabled students.\n\nBASF presented the 2016 Science Education Grants to the following schools during a reception at the company’s North American headquarters in Florham Park. Central Jersey school receiving grants included: Alexander Batcho Intermediate School in Manville; Branchburg Central Middle School; Colonia Middle School; Hunterdon Central Regional High School: and John P.

During the assembly, he asked them questions about weather and even had staff and students blow into his portable weather station to see how fast the “wind speed” was. According to staff and students their favorite part was having one students from each class come up and practice using a green screen. Some practiced being a weather forecaster while others had different backgrounds to practice with.\n\nMarshall had an entire interactive presentation that not only talked about weather in general but what he does at his job. He showed clips of his weather reports that have been on the news and demonstrated using a green screen.

In addition, MCC was named as the number 4 two-year school in the nation for veterans by Online College Plan, a college online search service for prospective students and their parents.\n\nMCC President Joann La Perla-Morales credited the MCC Veterans Services Center for the rankings. Established in 2011 with support from the Willard T.C. Johnson Foundation, the center’s mission is to assist with quality education and comprehensive support services.\n\n“The center has done a great job in assisting military veterans as they transition to civilian life,” she said in a news release. “They make sure veterans receive all the entitlements for which they are eligible, coordinate services they need to be successful, and create an environment where they can socialize with other military veterans.”\n\nOne such veteran is Mike Gada, who was in the Army and is now a computer science major.\n\n“The Veterans Center has been a focal point for making sure I’m on the correct path to achieve my full potential,” he said.\n\nRichard Feldman, the coordinator of the Veterans Center, said he was grateful for the generous support of the Willard T.C. Johnson Foundation.\n\n“The foundation has allowed us to make a real difference in the lives of these men and women,” he said. “I love watching these students prosper in their transition back into civilian life. One of my favorite days of the year is Commencement, where I can watch with pride as our veterans graduate.”\n\nThe rankings are published in full in the issues of Army Times, Navy Times, Air Force Times and Marine Corps Times.\n\nMilitary Advanced Education (MAE) named MCC a Top School in its 2017 MAE Guide to Colleges & Universities, measuring best practices in military and veteran education.

President George Bush was reluctant to sign it, because his advisors told him service members would leave the military en mass. “I told him this bill would actually encourage young men and women to join,” Mr. Lisicki said. “As I was leaving the Oval Office, he winked at me and said ‘You’ll have your G.I. Bill.’”\n\nLisicki said he was very proud of Middlesex County College and the work of the Veterans Center.\n\n“They’re doing a wonderful job,” he said. “And that’s proven by all these awards. They help these young people transition from military to civilian life.”\n\nNorth Plainfield High School\n\nOn Nov. 4, volunteers with Prudential met with North Plainfield High School AP and Honors Calculus students to discuss the field of actuarial sciences. A job in the actuarial sciences is one of the top-ranked professions that are in search of college graduates with an expertise in mathematics.\n\nPrudential has launched an Early Awareness Program to inform high school students about the many possibilities that exist in the field. Many students expressed their interest in the actuarial sciences and Prudential volunteers guided students in terms of possible majors and colleges.\n\nThe team taught students about the importance of probability and statistics when analyzing insurance along with what it means to be an actuary. Students were excited to be a part of the experience.\n\n“This workshop has given me an opportunity that I did not know was available before. I now will consider the Actuarial Sciences when applying to college,” senior Fredy Penaranda said.\n\nSubmitted by Lauren Myer, Supervisor of Math\n\nPolytech High School\n\nHigh school students considering attending Hunterdon Polytech during their junior and senior years can begin to learn more about the school by attending tours of Polytech’s facilities.\n\nDuring the coming months, all five of Hunterdon County’s high schools and West Morris Central will be bringing interested students to visit Polytech and sit in on classes as the students begin to think about their schedules for the last two years of high school, according to a district news release.\n\n“Being the only shared-time high school in New Jersey leads to a lot of questions and confusion on the students’ part, and these tours give us the opportunity to address any concerns and clear up any misconceptions there may be regarding Polytech,” said Dr. Kim Metz, superintendent of Hunterdon County Vocational School District, in the news release.\n\nDuring their visit, students can sit-in on multiple classes and experience what a normal school day would be like if they were to attend Polytech.\n\n“We offer such a variety of courses that students sometimes find themselves struggling to choose one, so we want to introduce them to as many options as possible,” Metz said.\n\nParents that would like to learn more about Polytech can also schedule a tour by contacting Dan Sexton at dsexton@hcvsd.org. In addition, if your son or daughter is not a student of one of the five high schools or West Morris Central but is interested in Polytech, contact Sexton to arrange a tour of Polytech. The application for Polytech is due by March 1, and can be found online at www.hcpolytech.org.\n\nReadington Township School: Three Bridges School\n\nStudents at Three Bridges School collected 400 pounds of candy this fall to send to U.S. troops stationed overseas. Third-grade Student Voice members helped collect and weigh the candy, which will be shipped through Operation Jersey Cares, along with “thank you for your service” cards made by Donna Kwiatkowski-Belt’s second-grade class.\n\nRutgers University\n\nA team of five Rutgers University undergraduates were honored Dec. 5 by Rutgers' Department of Ecomonics for winning the 13th Annual College Fed Challenge in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt last Dec. 1 challenge, the Rutgers team beat out teams from Princeton, Darmouth and University of Chicago, said Professor Emeritus Jeff Rubin, who was faculty advisor to the team.\n\nThe competition encourages students to learn about the U.S. economy, monetary policymaking and the role of the Federal Reserve System. The Rutgers team represented the New York Federal Reserve District and included Karn Dalal of Basking Ridge, a junior majoring in economics and biomathematics, Ali Haider Ismail of Millstone township, a senior majoring in economics and mathematics, Andrew Lee of Marlboro, a senior majoring in finance with a double minor in economics and political science, Shivram Viswanathan of West Windsor, a junior majoring in economics and mathematics, and Ashton W. Welles of Teaneck, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Economics.\n\nAfter graduation, Ismail will go on to be a research assistant at the Chicago Federal Reserve after graduation, while Lee has a position with Citibank lined up.\n\nThe College Fed Challenge is a competition designed to bring real-world economics into the classroom. Teams play the role of monetary policymakers by analyzing economic conditions and recommending a course for monetary policy.\n\nThe finals were held in the Board Room at the Board of Governors as the capstone to five district competitions held around the country. Teams analyze economic and financial conditions and formulate a monetary policy recommendation, modeling the Federal Open Market Committee. After meeting with Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet L. Yellen, the teams each made 15 minute presentations on the state of the economy including an economic forecast and a recommendation for monetary policy. They were asked questions by a panel of economists representing different federal reserve banks.\n\nTeams were evaluated on economic analysis, responses to judges' questions, teamwork and presentation.\n\nThe other national finalists included Dartmouth College in second place, with honorable mentions for Appalachian State University, Princeton University and The University of Chicago.\n\nSomerset County Vocational & Technical High Schools\n\nK-9 Sheriff’s Officer David Daneker and his partner Apex visited the Law and Public Safety program at Somerset County Vocational & Technical High School in Bridgewater on Nov. 16.\n\nThe K-9 visit coincided with the Law and Public Safety students’ lessons on case law. During Daneker’s presentation, he discussed case law and the procedures involved when the K-9 unit is requested. Apex and Daneker also performed a locker search demonstration so the students could see first-hand what is involved in their job duties.\n\n“It’s important to explain to the students that it is not only a job, but a huge responsibility to the community,” Daneker. said.\n\nHe added that K-9 units are huge assets for law enforcement because of the dogs' powerful sense of smell and abilities to work in all circumstances.\n\nThe Pingry School\n\nThe Wardlaw-Hartridge School\n\nOn Monday, Nov. 21, 11th Grade U.S. History classes from The Wardlaw-Hartridge School in Edison traveled to Gettysburg National Military Park for a one-day Civil War field trip. The trip was made possible, in part, by a $1,500 Field Trip Fund Grant from the Civil War Preservation Trust, which provides funding and assistance to teachers who are planning field trips to Civil War, War of 1812, or Revolutionary War battlefields or related historic sites.\n\nStudents started their day by learning about the Pre-Civil War era, the Election of 1860, and key events leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg through a short film. They then viewed a sound and light show inside the Cyclorama, a 360-degree cylindrical painting (22 feet high) that depicts Pickett’s Charge. Students also toured the museum, which contained many artifacts, letters, and interactive exhibits.\n\nThe highlight of the day was the extensive, guided bus tour around the Gettysburg Battlefields and the Gettysburg National Cemetery.\n\nEduardo Martinez of Scotch Plains said, \"The soldiers' mentality was very interesting to learn about, considering death was imminent and they almost all had families.”\n\nPriya Golding of North Plainfield said, \"I realized I could spend a whole day in there and not even see everything. I was so intrigued and interested, that I would definitely consider visiting again.”\n\nHere is a look at some recent activities at The Wardlaw-Hartridge School:\n\nPeter Van Buskirk, a 35-year veteran of the selective college admission process, made a presentation at the school on Nov. 30. Van Buskirk addressed primarily sophomores, juniors and their parents about the competitive college application process today. He spoke about finding the right fit college by knowing yourself. Other highlights included his Pyramid of Selectivity, Hotspots and Hooks and the Hidden Agenda, among others. The evening ended with the audience becoming the college admission committee and making a decision about accepting only one of four applicants. Van Buskirk is the author of \"Winning the College Admission Game: Strategies for Students and Parents,\" and \"Prepare, Compete, Win! The Ultimate College Planning Workbook for Students.\"\n\nThe cast and crew at The Wardlaw-Hartridge School entertained their audience during a weekend run of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" with two performances on Nov. 18 and 19. This production appealed to all ages. Leading players included senior Carlin Schildge of Westfield, who was performing in her final W-H play, juniors Hannah Yates of Piscataway, Steven Bessette of Scotch Plains, ThomasBorner Du Cane of Plainfield and CJ Stueck of Scotch Plains, and freshmen Kallie Schildge of Westfield and Shane Kornecki of Colonia.\n\nThe school’s Girls on the Run Team braved the blustery elements of the coldest autumn day by completing its season ending 5K run in Somerville on Nov. 20. The girls, in grades 3-5, finished the race after being guided by their coaches in training and other bonding activities throughout the past two months. Coaches Erin Maciorowski of Neptune City, Lower School Technology Integrator, and Nicole Nolan of Bridgewater, Upper School humanities teacher, finished second and third in their age group, respectively. Third-grade student Ryan Maciorowski, running alongside his mom, also finished second in his age group.\n\nMiddle School students showed their global engagement and commitment to service by providing support for the Haiti relief effort. The students raised $1,230.35 through contributions, which included donations and the proceeds from the recent Middle School dance. Funds will be sent to Direct Relief International. Middle School student council president Shaan Jasti of Colonia and members of the executive board presented a check to Maggie Granados, Assistant Head of School for Lower and Middle School, during lunch on Nov. 18.\n\nThird-grade students at The Wardlaw-Hartridge School have been immersed in learning about weathering, erosion and deposition. The students worked in groups and gathered evidence of weathering and erosion and made iMovies. They also looked at images of erosion destruction and then brainstormed about ways to prevent the disintegration of the Jersey Shore coastline. They created a model of the shoreline, eroded it, and then built a barrier. In addition, the students also learned more about three types of rock, sorted them and then made metamorphic cookies to eat.\n\nThomas Edison State University\n\nThe Thomas Edison State University Foundation has been awarded a $10,000 grant from The Provident Bank Foundation in support of the University’s Military and Veteran Portal (MVP) Career Enhancement Initiative and overall improvements to the portal.\n\nA recent study commissioned by the National Association of Veteran-Serving Organizations reported that 48 percent of transitioned service members found their transition to civilian jobs to be more difficult than expected. With the support of The Provident Bank Foundation, the University is working to change that statistic, according to a news release.\n\nThe MVP’s Career Enhancement Initiative is intended to connect military and veteran users with career advising and specific job opportunities based on their interests and military training. The university in Trenton plans to partner with 10 community colleges in New Jersey and Pennsylvania within Provident Bank’s service area to successfully actualize the enhanced MVP. The Initiative is expected to provide successful transitions to post-military careers for nearly 500 veterans who are projected to take part.\n\nLaunched in 2014, the University’s MVP enables active-duty service members and veterans to better understand how their military training can be transferred as credit toward a college degree, view potential degree programs aligned with their military training and estimate their education costs all before they apply for admission to Thomas Edison.\n\nIn 2015-2016, 4,632 military personnel used the MVP to validate their prior learning and transition into degree programs, thus helping to create a nationwide best practice educational program. To date, according to the news release, Thomas Edison remains the institution that serves the largest number of military and veteran students in the state of New Jersey, with those currently enrolled representing all 50 states nearly 60 countries.\n\nFor more information, visit www.tesu.edu.\n\nWestfield Public Schools: Edison Intermediate\n\nEdison Intermediate School in Westfield thanked America’s veterans on Nov.15 in a filled gymnasium decorated in red, white and blue banners paying tribute to the country’s servicemen and women.\n\nSpecial guest, Brenda Sue Fulton, who in 1976 was a member of the first female class in the US Military Academy at West Point, gave three reasons why she is proud to be a U.S. Army veteran: Leadership, respect for all, and support of the constitution. Fulton was a signal officer, served as a platoon leader and company commander in Germany, before receiving an honorable discharge at the rank of captain.\n\nSeveral other invited veterans lined the bleachers while being entertained by the school’s concert band and eighth-grade chorus under the direction of John Scozzaro, Kenneth Horn, and Kristine Smith-Morasso. In addition to music, a slide show, and readings by students, a salute to the flag was accompanied by the presentation of colors by the Combat Logistics Battalion 25 from Red Bank.\n\nEdison Principal Matthew Bolton told the 829-member study body comprised of sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders that \"you are going through a significant time in your life. You make decisions about who you want to be. ou need models for good character and values. There are no better models than the United States veterans.\""
