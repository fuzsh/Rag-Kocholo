        "text": "The three largest school districts in Hamilton County saw only slight changes in enrollment this year, supporting predictions that the years of booming growth for these schools are likely over.\n\nState data shows the number of students at Hamilton Southeastern, Carmel Clay and Noblesville Schools has become more stable over the past five years.\n\nOn the state's September count day this year, all three districts reported enrollment increasing by 1 percent or less. The state uses the September report for its school funding formula; each district receives more than $5,000 per student.\n\nCarmel administrators' paid leave: Relationship between Carmel's superintendent, HR director is 'part of review' during leave\n\nLagging behind: Outcomes for black children should be considered 'a national crisis,' report said\n\nWhich is better: Dual-credit or Advanced Placement? Hamilton Southeastern helps answer\n\nHamilton Southeastern has 234 more students than last year, with 21,347 total. Noblesville grew by 132 students for a total of 10,420. Carmel gained fewer than 100 students, with a total of 16,036.\n\nThe most rapid growth in the area is in Westfield, where schools added 325 students, about 4.3 percent of its student body. In the past five years, Westfield's student body has increased by about 15 percent for a total of 7,835.\n\nThe boom in school-age children in Westfield is expected to continue. Demographic reports predict the district will have 1,300 more students in the next 10 years. To accommodate current and future students, the community passed a construction referendum worth about $90 million to be spent on expanding and renovating the intermediate, middle and high schools.\n\nAt HSE and Carmel, this new stability is expected to continue. Recent demographic studies commissioned by the districts predict enrollment at both will level, then continue to decreasing slightly over the next 10 years. Carmel's study predicts the district would have 968 fewer students by 2026.\n\nAs a result, district spokeswoman Courtney Taylor previously said there are no plans for new buildings.\n\nâ–º IndyStar North: Get Hamilton County news delivered to your inbox\n\nHamilton Southeastern, however, is building an elementary school, expected to open fall 2019. The new building on Cyntheanne Road, which originally was planned six years ago, is meant to accommodate students who are learning out of mobile classrooms behind their schools. Districtwide, nearly 40 portable buildings are being used.\n\nThis stabilization among school-age children doesn't mean Hamilton County as a whole is done growing. Last year, it was the fastest-growing area in the state, gaining about 7,000 residents while more than half of Indiana's counties experienced population declines.\n\nBut most of the county's school districts expect housing construction to slow and the overall population to age, as families who swarmed to the area become empty nesters."
