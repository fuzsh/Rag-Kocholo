        "text": "Ages 18 Months to 3 Years\n\nThis program takes advantage of the young child's natural drive for learning by offering age appropriate exploration and independence by focusing on self care, gross and fine motor development, social responsibility and language. Daily activities include the promotion of independent self care such as dressing and hygiene combined with practical life activities such as food prep, cleaning, plant and animal care to bolster personal as well as community responsibility. Our toddler students are encouraged to run, jump, climb and balance safely while learning manners and how to appropriately interact with peers, teachers and their environment. Learning through the exploration of independence, language, movement and socialization, is the simplest (and most fun) way to develop the Montessori toddler's mind.\n\nAdmissions"
