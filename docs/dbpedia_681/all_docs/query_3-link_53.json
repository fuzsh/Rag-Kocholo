        "text": "St. Mary’s Parish School is a Catholic school serving grades Preschool – Grade 8. Our fundamental purpose is the cultivation of each student’s spiritual, intellectual, and physical life. We believe that this purpose is best achieved by an administration and faculty dedicated to the principles of Catholic education. Because of our strong reliance upon family values, we are committed to the Church’s apostolate to the family and recognize parents as the primary educators of young people in matters of faith and moral development. It is only with this strong family witness that our faculty can more fully develop the potential within each student.\n\nEver mindful of the wide-ranging academic and social interests of our students, St Mary’s points to the Gospel message as the source of guidance for each individual. It should be understood that attendance at St Mary’s Parish School requires students to give daily witness to the Gospel message by a Christian manner of conduct, respectful and intelligent choices, and sound moral values.\n\nOur facilities provide a Christian environment for children ages 3 through grade 8.\n\nPreschool\n\nSt. Mary’s Preschool program is opening to students who will or have turn three years old by September 1.\n\nThe preschool takes a thematic approach to learning. Themes will give the perfect balance of education and fun. Weekly Reader Pre-K will be used to support the teaching goals. Each issue is built on a firm foundation of skills to build student knowledge and reinforce curriculum. To balance out the daily schedule, teacher-directed activity is alternated with child-directed activity. Children have ample time to explore, discover, and learn through play.\n\n• Caring, nurturing teachers who are all certified and trained in CPR and First Aid\n\n• Ongoing child assessments with\n\nparent/teacher conferences twice\n\nper year\n\n• Age-appropriate curriculum\n\n• Outdoor and indoor play areas\n\n• Safe and secure buildings\n\nPre-Kindergarten\n\nSt. Mary’s Preschool program is opening to students who will or have turn four years old by September 1.\n\nThis program uses the Scholastic Big Day for Pre K Early Learning Program and is aligned with the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks. Big Day is an effective early learning program that embraces children’s natural curiosity and encourages them to explore and connect to the world around them. Each day is organized around three Big Experiences – Whole Group, Circle Time Lessons, and a teacher directed lesson.\n\n• Caring, nurturing teachers who are all certified and trained in CPR and First Aid\n\n• Ongoing child assessments with\n\nparent/teacher conferences twice\n\nper year\n\n• Age-appropriate curriculum\n\n• Outdoor and indoor play areas\n\n• Safe and secure buildings"
