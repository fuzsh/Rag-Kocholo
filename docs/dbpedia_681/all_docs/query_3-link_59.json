        "text": "High school in Chantilly, Virginia, United States\n\nWestfield High School is a public high school in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, west of the Chantilly CDP.[2]\n\nIt is a part of Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS), serving students from the communities including Chantilly and Centreville as well as areas with Herndon addresses in grades 9–12. Opened in 2000, it is the head of the Westfield High School Pyramid in Cluster VIII. Westfield's main building has the same layout as South County High School (Fairfax County, Virginia). At 3,260 students, it is one of the largest four-year high schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia.[3]\n\nThe school was listed as the 46th best high school in the United States by Newsweek magazine in 2002[4] and 27th in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area by The Washington Post in 2006[5] due to a high percentage of students enrolled in Westfield's Advanced Placement (AP) classes. Westfield shares a business partnership with Northrop Grumman's business IT group that entails sharing of buildings, as well as financial donations and gifts of supplies.[6] It also shares an education partnership with Centreville Presbyterian Church to improve student achievement.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield was first conceived to help deal with the extensive overcrowding at adjacent schools, primarily Centreville and Chantilly high schools. Plans for Westfield High school originated in 1995 when it was conceived as West County High School.[8] Westfield's colors and mascot were chosen by community members in the months before its grand opening in 2000.[9][10][11] By 2005, Westfield had grown so large that it had become one of the largest four-year high schools in Virginia.[3] An additional wing was planned to help deal with the overcrowding,[12] and was completed in summer of 2006.\n\nRegulation 1320.1\n\n[edit]\n\nRegulation 1320.1 (also known as Guidelines for Restricting Interruptions to Instructional Time—Middle and High Schools) was implemented on April 21, 2004, as an FCPS directive.[13] It was adopted by the county school board to ensure that instructional time in middle and high schools meet limits set by the Virginia Department of Education. The directive limited events such as assemblies and pep rallies by categorizing them as after-school events, with the exception of homecoming pep rallies.\n\nLocal radio station DC101's Elliot in the Morning show held a contest in fall 2004 for area high school students whose winners were to host alternative rock band Taking Back Sunday at their school. Westfield students won this contest, whose result was approved by former principal Mike Campbell with the concert date set for Tuesday, November 16.[14] However, students soon learned that a clause in Regulation 1320.1 prohibiting assemblies by business-sponsored groups prevented plans for the concert from being carried out. On Monday, November 15, students began a Taking Back Tuesday movement advocating a schoolwide skip day on the day of the cancelled concert, but it dissolved after Campbell's schoolwide address that afternoon.[14]\n\nFollowing the incident, students and parents appealed to the school board to return pep rallies to the instructional period and to reconsider the regulation. In a review by the Parent Teacher Student Association, it was found that the school was only allowed one pep rally during the year, adding to the confusion of the situation.[15] In February 2005, FCPS clarified its policy stating that the regulation on pep rallies was not meant to limit school spirit, but the concert remained cancelled.[16]\n\nViolence controversies\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Virginia Tech shooting and Seung-Hui Cho\n\nWestfield received media attention in the mid-2000s because two murders perpetrated by alumni occurred within one year.[17]\n\nMichael Kennedy, who suffered from schizophrenia, shot and killed Master Police Officer Michael Garbarino and Detective Vicky Armel of the Fairfax County Police Department on May 8, 2006, in an attack on the Sully District Police Station, less than one-half mile from Westfield.[18] On April 5, 2007, Kennedy's father was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of drug possession and six counts of weapons charges. The indictment mentioned charges that Kennedy's father illegally possessed marijuana, which made it illegal for him to possess the weapons or ammunition used by Kennedy in the police station attack.[19]\n\nThe 2007 Virginia Tech massacre committed by gunman Seung-Hui Cho, an alumnus of Westfield High School, killed thirty-two people, including two Westfield alumnae, Erin Peterson and Reema Samaha.[17] There is no evidence that Cho singled either out during the attack or even knew them.[20] Although Cho's motivation for the shooting is unknown, his suicide note mentioned vague references to his emotional turmoil.[21][22] While a few students recall instances of Cho being teased and mocked at Westfield, most left him alone and were not aware of his anger.[23][24] It is unknown if or how much his experience at Westfield contributed to his mental breakdown. Journalists from the international media arrived at Westfield the day Cho's identity was announced, prompting a ban on reporters at six athletic games due \"the impact... on school children, academics and other important activities.\"[25] Criticism of the school's learning environment also prompted students and alumni to rally against the media's biased reporting by emphasizing their many achievements.[26] As a way to honor the two deceased alumnae, the Erin Peterson Fund and Reema J. Samaha Memorial Scholarship Fund were established with the school's support to award scholarships for graduating seniors who best exemplify their personalities.[27]\n\nDrug incidents\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, incidents involving Westfield alumni purchasing and distributing heroin made local headlines. The first was the death of 19-year-old Alicia Lannes,[28] a graduate of Westfield in 2007, as a result of heroin overdose, which helped spark a federal investigation on heroin and other hard drugs and traffickers in the area.\n\nThe second incident occurred on November 20, when ten young adults and teenagers (six of them being Westfield High School alumni, and others attending Virginia Commonwealth University) were arrested as part of the shutdown of a major heroin ring responsible for the deaths of multiple students from Westfield and other local high schools.[29]\n\nIt is believed that the death of multiple students (including Alicia Lannes) and the heroin ring were linked.[28]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield's main structure was designed by Swirnow Structures LLC.[30] The same design was later used for the construction of South County Secondary School in the southern part of Fairfax County, but former Westfield principal Dale Rumberger denied claims of establishing a \"mini-Westfield\" despite becoming the principal at South County after leaving Westfield in 2004.[31][32]\n\nThe school campus occupies 159 acres (0.64 km2) and is composed of the main building (the \"school\"), the sports complex including all fields, and the parking lots. The main building currently comprises two levels, with seven main hallways for the classrooms on each level. There are also 13 trailers located around the school. The hallways are listed alphabetically from A-G, and an additional hallway, \"R\" (for \"renovation\"), was added onto the school for use beginning in the 2006–07 school year.[33] The heart of the school is the library and media center which currently holds over 21,000 books with room for an additional 4,000. There are over 40 computer stations for student use in the library.\n\nThere were four computer labs in Westfield, two on each level, making it among the most technologically advanced of any FCPS high school at the time it was built. The computer labs are now used as regular classrooms as every student is now provided with a laptop.There were 1,545 computers at Westfield as of June 2006.\n\nBeyond the main building, there is the sprawling Westfield Sports Complex, including the football stadium, a baseball field, a softball field, six tennis courts, a track which encircles a field for track and field, soccer, and lacrosse, and multiple practice fields. Adjacent to the complex is the Cub Run RECenter, home to Westfield's swim and dive team, although it is not part of the school.\n\nOvercrowding\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Westfield was often criticized as grossly overcrowded.[12] The building design provided for a capacity of 2,500 students, a number that was reached in its third year of opening.[11] When the school opened, the unincorporated communities of Centreville and Chantilly experienced a population and real estate boom that was not projected by the county.[34] By the 2004–2005 academic year, the school was over its capacity by 25 percent, and 26 trailers filled the parking lot originally designated for faculty and staff along with additional ground space surrounding the school's main building.[35]\n\nIn April 2003, FCPS proposed a bond referendum for the construction of a 24-room addition to Westfield's main building to alleviate the rapid growth of the student population. The bond referendum provided for the construction of the new addition at a cost of $8.7 million.[36] The bond was approved in November of the same year,[37] and construction for the massive new wing began in summer of 2005. Construction was completed in time for the 2006–2007 school year, increasing capacity to 3,100.[38] It has two levels and a basement.[12] It is called the R-hallway.\n\nSome former feeder communities of Westfield were re-zoned to the attendance boundary of South Lakes High School,[12][39] located in the unincorporated community of Reston. Due to this boundary adjustment Westfield's enrollment has declined and is currently considered under capacity with a 2013–2014 student membership of 2,750.[40]\n\nCommunity use\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern Virginia's New Life Christian Church held services at Westfield after relocating its main campus from Stone Middle School before building and moving to the Zone.[41] Three services are held each Sunday with an attendance of 1,500.[42]\n\nIn 2003, the Work Awareness and Transition (WAT) class opened a branch of the Apple Federal Credit Union for students and faculty. The branch is operated by student tellers in WAT.[43]\n\nHope Chinese School, a Chinese language school in the Washington area, designated Westfield as the site of its Chantilly campus in fall 2006.[44] Chinese language and cultural elective classes are held on Sunday afternoons in the new building addition.\n\nThe local area pro women's softball team Washington Glory will call the Westfield Sports Complex home for its 2008 season. The Glory played the 2007 season at George Mason University's softball complex which is undergoing a renovation during the 2008 season. The stadium will have increased seating for not only the Glory but also for the Virginia State Softball Championships which will also be hosted at the site along with baseball, lacrosse, soccer and track.[45]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield's faculty is divided into 10 departments: English, ESOL (English for speakers of other languages), Fine and Performing Arts, Foreign Language, Health and Physical Education, Mathematics, Career and Technical Education (CTE), Science, Social Studies, and Special Education.[46]\n\nAs one of 16 Fairfax County high schools that offer the Advanced Placement (AP) Program, Westfield will offer 22 of the 32 AP courses that are offered by the College Board as of the 2007–2008 school year. (The other 8 high schools are designated for the International Baccalaureate Program). In addition, the curriculum also offers Honors courses to prepare students for the rigorous workload associated with AP courses.[47]\n\nFairfax County's academy system also allows Westfield students to take alternate classes at Chantilly, Edison, Fairfax, Marshall, and West Potomac high schools with transportation provided.[48]\n\nWhen the school opened, Westfield possessed the newest computer labs and electronic equipment in the county. Westfield's Aerospace Science class is the only one of its kind in FCPS,[49] and its Television Production Lab is the most advanced of any FCPS school. Westfield also offers among the highest number of business-related, technology, and computer classes for any FCPS school, including its notable cooperative education program offered by the Professional and Technical Studies department.[50] The photography and computer graphics labs are among the most complete and advanced in FCPS and provide an extensive array of equipment available for student use.[51] The music technology lab is designed for music theory, and has special software for composing music.[52]\n\nThe Foreign Language department offers seven languages for students to study: American Sign Language,[53] French, German, Japanese, Korean, Latin, and Spanish.[54] Human Anatomy and Physiology is a unique course offered for Westfield science students who are interested in pursuing a career in the medical field and would like a more in-depth coverage on human systems than AP Biology.[55][56]\n\nWestfield's English department provides a number of unique elective courses such as forensics and debate, film study, and a course on William Shakespeare.[57] The Fine and Performing Arts department produced a news program which broadcasts information and upcoming events at or involving Westfield over the school's televisions on a daily basis.\n\nExtracurricular activities\n\n[edit]\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield has athletic teams in 19 different sports: baseball, basketball, cheerleading, crew, cross country/track and field, dance team, field hockey, football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey (club), lacrosse, soccer, softball, swim and dive, tennis, volleyball and wrestling.[58][59]\n\nThe school's athletic program is one of the most successful in the area, having earned numerous titles and championship berths in a wide range of varsity sports since 2000.[60] In fact, Westfield won two state championships in its first year of existence, when both a boy and a girl from the Swim and Dive Team captured individual state swimming honors in Westfield's inaugural winter sports season.\n\nWestfield's football program has been recognized as one of the top programs in the state and has earned five state titles,[61] three seasons ending with perfect records.[62] Due to Westfield's large enrollment, the school is categorized 6A-class, as defined by the Virginia High School League. Beginning with the 2017–18 academic year, it belongs to the Concorde District within Region D.[63] The football team won their fourth state championship in 2016 with a double overtime victory over Oscar Smith High School 34–28 and finished 13–2. The boys' outdoor track and field team earned its first Virginia AAA state title in 2004.[64] In 2004, the varsity baseball team reached the state championship final.[64] The boys' soccer team won the district and regional titles in 2005, overall becoming state semifinalists.[65]\n\nOn November 26, 2011, the Bulldogs lost to rival Centreville in which Centreville blocked Westfield's field goal with a minute left. The field goal would have sent the game into overtime. This was Centreville's first victory over Westfield since 2001.\n\nThe basketball team has had a recent string of success and won the Northern Region championship in 2015. The Bulldogs went on to play in the state championship where they fell short to the Colonial Forge Eagles 47–46. The team finished 27–2. In 2016, the team reached the state final yet again and faced the Oscar Smith Tigers for the second time in a state championship game that year as the football team won states against the Tigers back in the fall. Westfield prevailed with a 74–56 victory and captured the first state title for basketball in school history. The 2016 team finished 26–3.\n\nThe girls' lacrosse team won the 2014 VHSL 6A State championship over rival Oakton High School 13–11 and captured their first state championship. The game was played at Lake Braddock Secondary School.\n\nThe girls' field hockey team captured the 2013 and the 2017 VHSL State title both with a 2–1 upset over 2x defending champion First Colonial. The games were played at the Virginia Beach sports complex. The 2017 team finished 24–0.\n\nOne of the most successful athletic programs at Westfield is the wrestling team, having won eight district championships (2004–2009, 2011–2012), five Northern Region titles (2008–2010, 2012, 2020) and placing frequently in the top ten at the State Tournament.[66] Westfield wrestling has had at least 1 state champion wrestler for 10 consecutive years (2007–2016).\n\nWestfield's Track Team also won regionals indoor season of 2007 and outdoor season of 2007.\n\nOn October 11, 2002, a tremendous downpour postponed a Westfield varsity football game against rival Centreville for the Concorde District championship. Head coach Tom Verbanic, desperate to keep the game on time, had the field covered with tarps and hired a helicopter in an attempt to dry the field. Several thousand dollars later, the game was still postponed until November 17. The match resulted in a win for Westfield, earning the school's first district championship title.[67] The use of the helicopter for drying grass was later criticized heavily.[68]\n\nFootball State Championship Games Year Winning Team Losing Team Location (all in Virginia) Class 2003 Westfield 35 Landstown 14 University of Richmond Stadium, Richmond AAA Div. 6 2007 Westfield 42 Woodbridge 14 Scott Stadium, Charlottesville AAA Div. 6 2015 Westfield 49 Oscar Smith 42 Scott Stadium, Charlottesville 6A 2016 Westfield 34 Oscar Smith 28 Armstrong Stadium, Hampton 6A 2017 Westfield 28 Oscar Smith 21 Armstrong Stadium, Hampton Class 6\n\nBasketball State Championship Games Year Winning Team Losing Team Location (all in Virginia) Class 2015 Colonial Forge 47 Westfield 46 VCU, Richmond 6A 2016 Westfield 74 Oscar Smith 56 VCU, Richmond 6A\n\nBaseball State Championship Games Year Winning Team Losing Team Location (all in Virginia) Class 2004 Western Branch 3 Westfield 2 War Memorial Stadium, Hampton AAA 2019 Lake Braddock 6 Westfield 2 Deep Run High School AAA 2023 James Madison 5 Westfield 4 John Champe HS, Aldie AAA\n\nBoys' Lacrosse State Championship Games Year Winning Team Losing Team Location (all in Virginia) Class 2007 Robinson 11 Westfield 3 Westfield High School, Chantilly AAA\n\nGirls' Lacrosse State Championship Games Year Winning Team Losing Team Location (all in Virginia) Class 2014 Westfield 13 Oakton 11 Lake Braddock Secondary School, Burke AAA\n\nGirls' Field Hockey State Championship Games Year Winning Team Losing Team Location (all in Virginia) Class 2013 Westfield 2 First Colonial 1 Virginia Beach Sports Complex, Virginia Beach AAA 2017 Westfield 2 First Colonial 1 Virginia Beach Sports Complex, Virginia Beach AAA\n\nGolf State Tournaments Year Boys' Team Girls' Open Location (all in Virginia) Class 2003 2nd — AAA 2004 4th 53rd Chesdin Landing Golf Course, Chesterfield (boys)\n\nTwo Rivers Country Club, Williamsburg (girls) AAA 2005 2nd — AAA 2006 — 17th, 26th, 39th Forest Greens Golf Course, Dumfries (girls) AAA 2007 3rd 5th, 13th, 24th, 29th Dominion Valley Country Club, Haymarket (boys)\n\nFairfax National Golf Club, Centreville (girls) AAA 2008 3rd — Independence Golf Course, Midlothian (boys) AAA 2009 1st — Waterfront Country Club, Moneta (boys) AAA Virginia High School League does not rank teams overall in the girls' open.

From their existence onward, the Bulldogs have made five state championship appearances winning all five of them and appearing in 10 regional championship games since 2003. The Bulldogs have also clinched the Concorde District 5 times in 6 years from 2011 to 2016 with the lone exception in 2013. The Bulldogs completed their first perfect regular season record in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, the Bulldogs completed a 14–0 season after winning the northern region championship over rival Robinson 28–7,[72] then winning against the defending state champion C.D. Hylton 24–14 in the state semi-finals before a fantastic 35–14 win over Landstown in the VHSL 6A State Championship game winning them their first state championship in school history.[73]\n\nIn 2006, the Bulldogs advanced to the northern region championship game before falling to rival Chantilly 26–21 in the waning moments. Under the guidance of future NFL quarterback Mike Glennon, Westfield achieved another perfect season including a 28–16 win over the Chantilly Chargers[74] and a shutout of rival Centreville 33–0 in the regular season finale.[75] In the playoffs the Bulldogs won three regional playoff games by a combined margin of 139-54 en route to their second region championship including a 58–34 defeat of the West Springfield Spartans. Once in the state tournament, the Bulldogs faced the heavily favored Oscar Smith Tigers in the state semi-finals. The Bulldogs prevailed 24–21 setting up a matchup against the Woodbridge Vikings.[76] In Scott Stadium at the University of Virginia, the Bulldogs won their 2nd state title in school history.[77]\n\nIn 2011, long time football coach Tom Verbanic stepped down and defensive coordinator Kyle Simmons was brought in to fill in as the third head coach in school history.
