        "text": "On Nov. 7, Westfield residents voted against the The Edison Field referendum, putting the project to a complete stop. Had the vote succeeded, it would have approved an $11.8 million bond to finance changes to the fields behind Edison Intermediate School. The main outcomes of this project would have been creating multipurpose fields with synthetic turf, improving stormwater management and installing field lighting and amenities.\n\nAccording to a statement from Mayor Shelley Brindle, the $11.8 million price tag was more than enough to fully fund the project. Moreover, she explained that the $11.8 million ensured “maximum financial flexibility” in order to “consider the most environmentally sensitive materials and adequate screening landscaping.”\n\nWHS teams, such as baseball, band, color guard, football, ultimate frisbee and track and field all practice and host events on the fields. In addition, students at EIS use the fields during recess. According to westfieldnj.gov, the project would have provided an additional 2,500 incremental hours of playing capacity per year. Updating the fields would have allowed for a greater variety of teams and leagues to use and benefit from the space.\n\nStudents at WHS took this project close to heart. Seniors Sam Altman and Colin Cimei helped Brindle mobilize student votes. They reached out to WHS alumni to mail in ballots for the election and pushed for current students to tell their parents to vote if they were not of age themselves. They also targeted student athletes to speak in town council meetings and to spread more information about the election.\n\nIn the end, the turnout was not a success. This defeat marked an end to Westfield having turf fields in the near future. Altman said “There’s been thoughts about a reform bill without as much money being spent, but the mayor is not interested.”\n\nThere are mixed opinions regarding the final decision of the project. Many are saddened with the outcome of the vote. Westfield resident Adam Burrick said, “Ultimately it’s disappointing that the town refuses to keep up with facilities benefitting it and the volume of kids that need them.”\n\nStudent athletes especially feel that the decision is upsetting. Senior Sofia Gesser said, “I’m disappointed about the decision about the Edison field project. Westfield has so many championship winning teams, so it’s crazy how Westfield teams constantly have to split fields after school, practice at the middle schools where fields are grass and not maintained, and play right up until dark with no lights.”\n\nAs of now, it seems the fields will stay unchanged. While they are not in the best condition, they are still usable and will have to continue to function just as they have been for many years."
