        "text": "Ages 9-12\n\nOur upper elementary program dives into a higher level of thinking and concentration by exploring more science, history, self-awareness and higher community standards. Research and application of concepts learned are emphasized. As these children head into adolescence, this program transforms the child into a curious and compassionate young adult. Outdoor time, along with service work is plentiful, allowing the development of the whole child. The Elementary 2 classroom carefully prepares the students for their transition into Middle School.\n\nAdmissions"
