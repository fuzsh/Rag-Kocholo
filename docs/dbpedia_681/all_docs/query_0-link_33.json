        "text": "Tuesday, July 9, 2024\n\nGood morning parents/guardians,\n\nClark Public Schools will be applying for the NJ Department of Education (NJDOE) Preschool Education Aid (PEA). If we obtain this aid, we will have the opportunity to expand our preschool program to a full-day program for three and four-year old students in the coming years.\n\nTo help us plan for a successful potential expansion, we are asking that you complete the survey linked below. Please be aware that this expansion is dependent on NJDOE approval and that any preferences indicated on your survey are not guaranteed. Details such as specific site locations and start dates/years are not yet available. That information will be forthcoming as the grant process moves forward.\n\nPreschool Family Survey\n\nKindly complete a separate survey for each of your children who will be preschool-aged in the coming years. Please submit by the end of the day on Friday, July 19.\n\nWe are looking forward to this community, parent, and district collaboration with the goal of enhancing the education of our children. Thank you and be well.\n\nEd Grande\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nWednesday, November 8, 2023\n\nGood morning,\n\nAs was stated in the annual Security Reminder that was sent at the end of August, the Clark Schools and Clark Police have partnered with P3 Campus to provide a reporting tool for life safety concerns. Please see the link below to the reporting form for this service. A flyer containing a QR code to this form is posted on the district website at www.clarkschools.org under the “More” tab towards the top right of that page and then the “Security” sub-tab. This flyer will also be posted on each school’s website. This platform is one for our students, staff, and community members to communicate with us and the local police department regarding any life safety concerns. We ask for the detail provided through the form to be as thorough as possible so that the concern can be effectively followed up on.\n\nP3 Campus Reporting Form\n\nThank you in advance for your respect for this platform as another means of keeping our students, staff, and schools safe. Please know that all reports are filtered directly to the Clark Police Department, and false reports will be handled in the same manner that a false 911 call would be handled.\n\nThis service will be in place at the end of the workday today (Wednesday, November 8).\n\nThank you and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nEd Grande\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nMonday, September 11, 2023\n\nGood morning,\n\nPlease see the below attachment for a reminder of the COVID-19 guidelines.\n\nBelow is a link to our 2023-24 Student Health and Wellness Calendar.\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/5bfpn5sy\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Mrs. Lori Kowalski, Supervisor of School Nursing and Wellness, by email at lkowalski@clarkschools.org.\n\nMost importantly, let us be sure to keep those who passed on 911 and their families in our thoughts and prayers with today being the 22nd anniversary of this tragedy.\n\nThank you and be well.\n\nEd Grande\n\nSuperintendent of Schools\n\nThursday, January 13, 2022\n\nGood afternoon,\n\nNext Thursday (January 20) at 4 p.m., you will be receiving a text message from our district's SchoolMessenger short code number 67587. If you would like to begin receiving text messages in addition to phone calls and emails from SchoolMessenger, please respond to this text message with Y or YES. If for some reason you miss this text message, a flyer containing a QR code that will allow you to opt in after next Thursday at 4 p.m. is attached below. The QR code can only be used after next Thursday at that time. Parents/guardians, please make certain that your cell phone numbers are updated within Genesis prior to the end of the day next Tuesday (the 18th) as Genesis \"speaks\" to SchoolMessenger each evening and only phone numbers that are within Genesis will be able to receive text messages, even if the QR code is used.\n\nThank you for your cooperation. Enjoy the rest of the day ahead.\n\nEd Grande\n\nSuperintendent of Schools"
