        "text": "Daily Schedule\n\nIntermediate school hours are 8:45 a.m. to 3:35 p.m. A child is considered tardy if not in the classroom at 8:45 a.m. If you bring your child to school, please do not drop your child off at school before 8:20 a.m. No supervision is provided for students before 8:15 a.m.\n\nThe school office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.\n\nArrival and Dismissal of Students\n\nDrop off and pick up for WIS students is at the sidewalk in the designated drop off zone. Please be sure to stay in a single lane of traffic and drop off or pick up your child along the sidewalk. We ask that you do not drop off or pick up students in the parking lot. This will assure that students are not walking through busy traffic to get to areas of safety.\n\nAll 6th Grade students will be dropped off at door 2 and all 5th grade students will be dropped off at door 16. If you have students that you are picking up from both grade levels, you may choose either door 2 or door 16. In an effort to keep traffic moving in front of the building, students will be allowed inside the building at 8:20 a.m. Please respect the 8:20 a.m. time as there is no supervision provided before that time. Drivers are expected to wait with the student in the car until 8:20 a.m. Any student dropped off before 8:15 a.m. may be sent to Before & After Care (BAC) with the parent/guardian being responsible for the charges incurred.\n\nAfter School\n\nAll students are to leave school at dismissal time. No student should be in the building past 3:45 p.m. unless participating in a supervised activity. Students are to remain with supervisor(s). Students who have remained with staff for any supervised activity will be dismissed to the front lobby for parent/guardian pickup. Any student not picked up by 3:45 p.m. may be sent to Before & After Care (BAC) with the parent/guardian being responsible for the charges incurred.\n\nWalking Restrictions\n\nStudents are not allowed to walk home if they have to cross US 31 or SR 32. If you would like your child to walk home to the neighborhood adjacent to WIS, we do require a signed note from a parent/guardian to keep in the student’s file.\n\nStudents are not allowed to walk to the Westfield Public Library without supervision from an adult or older sibling (7th grade or higher).\n\nPlanned Early Dismissal\n\nIf it is necessary for a student to leave school during the school day, a written note stating the reason for this absence must be presented to the teacher at the beginning of the school day. These notes are forwarded to the school office for our files. Students will only be released to those listed in PowerSchool under Emergency Contacts with a Photo ID.\n\nParents/Guardians should come to the school office to pick up students for these early dismissals. Students will be called immediately upon the parent/guardian's arrival. Students who are returning the same day must present the doctor’s note to office staff upon re-entry or be accompanied to the office by the adult. A re-admit slip must be issued from the office before a student reports to class. A separate note or phone call by the parent/guardian should be made to the bus driver whenever a student will not be riding the bus.\n\nIf an unexpected circumstance arises during the day that requires you to pick up your child before school is dismissed, please call the office as soon as you know the change of plans. A call to the office after 2:00 p.m. cannot assure that the message will reach your child before the end of the day.\n\nVehicle Idling\n\nDrivers of all public and private vehicles are to turn off the engine if the vehicle is to be stopped for more than five (5) minutes in locations where vehicle exhaust may be drawn into the building or while on school grounds.\n\nEmergency School Delay/Cancellation/Dismissal\n\nThe cancellation or late beginning of school will be broadcast via the best method available. Parents will also be contacted through School Messenger, our emergency contact system. Parents are encouraged to keep phone contacts updated. Please do not call the superintendent’s office or school office to ask about the closing of school.\n\nCertain situations may require releasing students from school before the end of the day or relocating them from one school building to another. If students are released early or relocated, the school district will notify parents by providing information via School Messenger. Information will also be available on the school corporation website and through social media channels.\n\nIf there is an emergency school closing during school hours, it is imperative that your child knows exactly what he/she is supposed to do.\n\nExample 1: If your child is to go home he/she would always have a key or know where one is kept.\n\nExample 2: If your child is not to go home he/she must know where he/she is supposed to go.\n\nExample 3: If your child attends BAC, please make sure that he/she knows to attend BAC as normal.\n\nIf you transport your child to and from school, please make arrangements with someone who will always be able to pick him/her up.\n\nEmergency closing arrangement information on each student is requested from each parent/guardian the first week of school. Please keep this and other emergency information up to date during the school year in PowerSchool.\n\nIf a bus driver or other school person believes a child may be harmed by releasing him or her from a bus or school, and the parent or guardian is not present, alternative arrangements may be made. The parent or guardian will pay any cost for these services.\n\nSchool Visitors\n\nA SafeVisitor background check will be required for anyone who visits our schools and will spend unsupervised time with any student, including family members of our students. Examples of activities in the schools where visitors will need a completed SafeVisitor background check are listed below:\n\nLunch Guests\n\nClassroom Parties\n\nClassroom Volunteers/Helpers/Room Parents\n\nField Trip Chaperones\n\nExamples of activities that will not require a formal background check are listed below (these visitors will still follow normal school check-in procedures):\n\nClassroom Guest Speakers\n\nParent/Teacher Conferences/Case Conferences\n\nSpecial Events (Grandparent’s Day/Famous Hoosiers/etc.)\n\nSchool Programs\n\nVisiting school office area or dropping off items at the school\n\nBackground checks are good for four years at any school in the district. These background checks will cost $12.95 (additional fees may apply) and can be acquired via the link below.\n\nPlease note - this process could take 3 to 6 business days. Once approved, please be on the lookout for a badge notification email from “info@safevisitorsolutions.com.” Your badge will be attached as a PDF. You can either print it, save it on your phone, or download the SafeVisitor app. A photo will be required and added upon your first visit to the school.\n\nWeb address for SafeVisitor process:\n\nhttps://secure.safevisitorsolutions.com/Safe/Volunteer/003471/volunteer\n\nYou can find more information at www.wws.k12.in.us/Page/1474\n\nAccident Insurance for School-Aged Children\n\nStudent accident insurance is an inexpensive type of insurance that should be considered as a supplement to your regular insurance plan since it is very limited in scope. This insurance is made available as a courtesy to you and is not sponsored by the school.\n\nThe school carries no coverage on your child and can make no payments to cover medical costs. The insurance plan offered covers accidents that require medical attention that happen at school and on the bus. An application can be completed on the district website under Parent/Important Documents.\n\nBikes\n\nBikes may be ridden to school. However, they MUST be placed in the designated bike rack and appropriately secured immediately upon arrival. Any misuse will result in immediate loss of this privilege. The school is not responsible for any damage or loss of property.\n\nBirthdays\n\nWe recognize that birthdays are a special time. We will acknowledge students’ birthdays. However, as a result of our district’s Wellness Policy, we have changed our procedures for celebrating student birthdays at the classroom level. Please do not send in or bring in food treats, flowers, balloons, etc. Each elementary school will have its own guidelines for celebrating birthdays. Guidelines will be explained through “Meet the Teacher” nights and newsletters. No birthday party invitations may be distributed to students during the school day.\n\nTeachers may from time to time plan special event celebrations like the birth of a child, upcoming marriage etc. These are teacher initiated and co-planned with the office.\n\nCanvas\n\nCanvas is our learning management system. Parents can choose to create a Canvas observer account in order to see their student’s assignment due dates, teacher feedback on graded assignments, class announcements, and other course content. To learn more about Canvas observer accounts, click here.\n\nElectronic Devices/Cell Phones/Communication Devices\n\nStudents are prohibited from using a “wireless communication device” (as defined by Indiana law) during “instructional time” (as defined by Indiana Law). Teachers may give students permission to use a wireless communication device for educational purposes during instructional time. In addition, students are not allowed to have devices out during lunch or passing periods without permission from school personnel.\n\nStudents are permitted to use a wireless communication device\n\nin the event of an emergency;\n\nto manage a student's health care;\n\nif included in a student’s IEP;\n\nif included in the student’s plan developed under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and (5) if otherwise required by law;\n\nwith permission from school personnel.\n\nStudents are assigned a one-to-one device from the school for educational purposes. Students should keep personal cell phones and/or other wireless communications out of sight during each class period. Students will be accountable to the discipline code if they violate this rule. Checking the time, using a calculator, or using other cell phone functions will be considered usage. Text messaging, audio recording, or videos may only happen with permission from school personnel. The administration may confiscate any electronic device for inappropriate use.\n\nIf a student brings a personal device to school, the school is not liable for any loss or damage to it. The Technology Use Form must be completed in PowerSchool. All devices should be clearly labeled with the owner's name.\n\nIt is preferred that parents contact the receptionist if they need to contact a student (or vice versa) during the school day. The student will be provided with a pass to come to the office and take the call if needed.\n\nChanging Classrooms\n\nStudents are assigned to a homeroom class that works within a team/triad. Homeroom assignments may be adjusted within a team/triad when the teachers believe it would enhance academic programming.\n\nCurricular Materials and Student Fees\n\nThe Indiana Department of Education covers the cost of curricular materials for students. Parents will be invoiced for student fees, covering consumable and perishable items in a student’s classes. Full payment or a payment plan should be completed by the end of the first six weeks of school.\n\nIf a student's schedule changes during the year, fees may be adjusted based on the new classes. The parent may incur an additional cost or be due a credit. If a credit is on the account, a refund will be issued by the end of June.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools requires all unpaid fees not on a payment plan to be sent to a collection agency by the end of the school year. Any account turned over to collections will have an additional $10.00 fee added to its outstanding balance.\n\nIf a student is withdrawn from school, the parent will receive a prorated refund for any consumable item that has not been used. However, many consumable materials used in classes lose their value once they have been used for any part of a class.\n\nStudent fees are established annually and approved by the Board of School Trustees. Payment is collected at the district level. Payment can be made at the administration building with cash, check, credit card (Visa/Mastercard/Discover), or by completing a payment contract. Payment can also be made online through the PowerSchool interface. Payments made via credit card will be subject to credit card fees.\n\nDesks/Books/School Property\n\nIn the interest of protecting all children, the Board of School Trustees authorizes the principal or his/her designee to examine school desks, lockers, and their contents when deemed appropriate. Students are expected to care properly for all school property including desks, library books, textbooks, technology, etc. If a student destroys or loses school property he/she and his/her parents/guardians are responsible for the replacement cost.\n\nStudents are also expected to respect the property of their classmates and teachers.\n\nEvery Student Succeeds Act\n\nWestfield Washington Schools must comply with the Every Student Succeeds Act. Information regarding out-of-school suspensions and/or expulsions will remain part of each student’s permanent record that begins in kindergarten and concludes when a student graduates, transfers outside the district, or is expelled. Information about in-school suspensions or punishments by individual teachers, such as an after-school detention, is not part of the permanent record. These records will not appear on transcripts of grades that colleges receive. This information will be shared with other schools only when the student transfers. For more information, contact the Director of Student Services at 317-867-8006.\n\nField Trips\n\nEach team/triad may plan educational experiences away from the school building in the form of field trips. Fees may be assessed when necessary to cover admission and transportation costs. When space allows, there may be opportunities for parents/guardians to chaperone field trips. All parents/guardians serving as chaperones must complete the Safe Visitor background check as described above in the “School Visitor” section. For safety and supervision reasons, younger siblings are not permitted to attend field trips.\n\nIt is the policy of the Board of School Trustees that each child going on a field trip has a signed permission slip. Children who have failed to return a signed permission slip will remain at the building and will be assigned alternative work. *A student without proof of proper immunizations is considered in violation of IC 20-34-4-5 students will not be allowed to attend field trips and/or extracurricular activities until immunization records are up to date and on file with the school nurse.\n\nMessages to Parents\n\nIn keeping with the Intermediate School’s philosophy to promote student growth, our students are discouraged from calling home for “forgotten” items. Hopefully, the student will take responsibility for arriving at school with all needed materials. On a rare occasion when a teacher has requested that a student call home for a forgotten item, the office will notify the student’s teacher by email once the item has been delivered.\n\nMessages to Students and Teachers\n\nIf a parent/guardian wishes to get a message to a student or teacher during school hours, they may call the office. If the message is about a dismissal change, please call the school office to be sure that the message is received no later than 2:00 p.m.\n\nStudents and teachers are not called to the telephone except in emergency situations. Parents/Guardians should be sure that pick-up arrangements for after-school activities are finalized before coming to school so the use of a telephone is not necessary. Teachers are with students throughout the day and may not be able to return your message promptly.\n\nMoney\n\nChildren are discouraged from bringing money to school unless there is a definite need for it. The school is not responsible for the loss of money.\n\nSchool Messenger\n\nSchool Messenger is the WWS electronic parent/guardian notification system. Emergency notifications, weather delays, closings, student documentation, general building information and district information are sent via voice messaging, text messages and email notification to the phone numbers and email addresses provided. Email is generally used for non-emergency situations (i.e. weekly newsletters or district announcements). For an emergency or immediate activity, the system calls the parents/guardians’ listed number and sends a text to the cell phone number provided. Please be sure to keep accurate email addresses and phone numbers in PowerSchool. Parents/guardians can update their email and phone number by notifying the front desk of their child’s school.\n\nTalkingPoints\n\nWestfield Washington Schools uses TalkingPoints as a multilingual communication tool between teachers and families. Families can choose to receive messages via SMS text messaging or through the free FAMILIES/TalkingPoints mobile app for Apple or Android. To ensure messages are received from your child’s teachers, make sure your contact information for the “Father” and “Mother” fields in PowerSchool are correct. When a teacher sends a message, TalkingPoints will automatically use these two phone numbers. If you would like to add additional contacts, please reach out to your child’s teachers.\n\nTechnology Guidelines (Policy A300)\n\nThe use of technology (this policy includes, but is not limited to): telephones, cellular devices, digital media players, tablets, laptop and desktop computers and workstations, direct radio communication, Internet access, voice mail, e-mail, text messaging, direct messaging through device applications, facsimile transmission and receipt, artificial intelligence, including\n\nlanguage-generation tools and large language models, and any computer based research and/or communication) is a privilege. Abuse or misuse of the equipment, policies, or rules will lead to a loss of privileges or disciplinary action by school administration. Students and their parents/guardians are responsible for the cost of repair or the cost of replacement of any damage incurred either by vandalism or carelessness. All technology use is governed by the Responsible Use of Technology and Internet Use Policy (A300).\n\nStudent owned personal devices and Corporation technology shall be used by students under teacher supervision with the purpose of improving instruction and stude\n\nSchool Meal Assistance\n\nFinancial assistance is available to parents who complete a Household Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals form and qualify for assistance. The forms are available during registration, online or at the administration building. The form completed must be for the current school year.\n\nA child is eligible if the total household income and the amount and source of income received by each household member fall within federal guidelines for Free/Reduced Meals.\n\nTobacco Products\n\nSmoking and tobacco use are prohibited in and on school grounds. Tobacco and nicotine-based products and look-a-like products such as electronic cigarettes are specifically prohibited by Indiana Statute and Westfield Washington Schools. Tobacco includes, but is not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, smokeless tobacco, nicotine, nicotine delivering devices, chemicals, or devices that produce the same flavor or physical effect of nicotine substances; and any other tobacco or nicotine innovations. Violations will result in serious consequences as outlined in the due process section of this handbook.\n\nToys/Games/Electronic Devices\n\nNo cell phones are permitted to be out or used during the school day. If a student brings a cell phone to school, it must be kept in their locker at all times. There may be times when electronic devices, such as iPads or e-Readers, may be permissible in the classroom. The teacher may request a permission slip to be signed. At no time, will the school be responsible for lost, stolen, or damage to these devices.\n\nToys, games, electronic devices, sports or collectible cards, etc. brought to school without such permission will be kept by the teacher or school office until a parent/guardian picks them up.\n\nSports equipment may be brought to school only after the classroom teacher approves it and at student’s own risk. Any equipment brought in must be labeled with the child’s name and be left in the designated area until time for the activity.\n\nThe school is not responsible for any of the above items being damaged, lost or stolen while on school property or at school events.\n\nVolunteers\n\nVolunteers are welcomed and always needed in our school. Those volunteers who work directly with students or supervise a group of students on a field trip must complete the SafeVisitor background check. Please see the section on School Visitors in this handbook.\n\neLearning\n\neLearning days are held in place of cancellation days which would need to be made up later, often in June, by adding days onto the end of the school calendar. When these make-up days are at the end of the school year they do not reflect the learning that was needed at the time of the day off. WWS eLearning days allow students to continue to make educational progress. This is especially important when faced with high stakes tests (ILEARN, AP, IREAD-3, etc.) which have fixed testing dates regardless of the number of cancellation days.\n\nSchool cancellation days will be eLearning Days unless otherwise communicated.\n\nAll classroom work will be posted by 10:00 AM on the day of the cancellation. K-4 students will find their work posted on Google Classroom and have a designated window to complete the work. 5-12 students will find their work on Canvas and have two school days to complete. For those students who do not have device or internet access, school lab hours will be posted. In addition, WWS partners with local businesses to provide students the opportunity to use WiFi during operating hours of the business.\n\nTeachers will have set office hours to provide students with instruction and technical support that will be communicated to students and parents. A tech hotline is also available to support students and parents as issues arise.\n\nAttendance will be determined by students logging in and engaging in their classwork over the duration of the eLearning period.\n\nLists of Frequently Asked Questions, staff office hours, Westfield WiFi Partners, and other information can be found on each school's website under the Parents tab.\n\nThe above protocols are for eLearning days due to inclement weather or other short-term or emergency situations. Should we need to move to eLearning for an extended period of time, such as the situation with COVID-19, guidance specific to the situation will be communicated.\n\nGrade Reporting to Parents/Guardians\n\nStudents in grades five through twelve receive letter grades. The grading scale is as follows:\n\n<TABLE>\n\nQuarter final grade reports will be available online in PowerSchool. Throughout the quarters, parents/guardians should check their child’s progress in PowerSchool and talk to their child about their social, emotional and academic progress. If you feel that a conference to discuss your child’s progress is needed, please call your child’s teacher, or write a note to the teacher.\n\nRelated Arts classes (including Art, Music/Band, P.E. and STEM) meet each day for nine weeks. It is an expectation that students signing up for band, remain in band for the school year. Students may only transfer out of band with administration approval, and only at the end of a quarter.\n\nHigh Ability\n\nWestfield’s high ability services fall under a range of K-12 services in the RtI (Response to Instruction) process. Official identification occurs in late spring for grades K, 2, and 6, with additional qualifications in 8th grade for specific high ability courses at Westfield High School. Early services include flexible grouping, differentiation, and enrichment within the classroom and grade level. Middle and upper services include acceleration and honors/AP/ACP courses. Students may qualify in language arts and/or math. For more information, contact your child’s principal or the Assistant Superintendent - Curriculum & Instruction at, 317-867-8009.\n\nILEARN Remediation & Preventive Remediation Opportunities/Title I\n\nThe Board considers it very important that parents/guardians be consulted and informed at the earliest possible date when student participation in ILEARN Remediation and Preventive Remediation classes/groups is recommended.\n\nStudents who are at risk of not meeting NWEA, or ILEARN standards in language arts/and or math may also participate in activities funded by Title I in those schools which receive federal funding.\n\nParent/Guardian Teacher Conferences\n\nParent/Guardian teacher conferences at the request of the parent/guardian or teacher. Parents/Guardians are encouraged to call the office and make an appointment to meet with teachers or the principal whenever necessary. Parents/Guardians are also invited to participate in a phone conference when time will not permit a personal visit. Each staff member has voicemail and email to make contact convenient for parents/guardians. Once school begins, contact information will be available.\n\nRelease of Directory and Student Records/Privacy Act Information (Policy E175)\n\nAs referenced in Policy E175 and in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), sensitive information about students is kept confidential. FERPA defines \"directory information\" as information contained in the education records of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as student’s name, address, parents’/guardians’ names, major field of study, sex, age, date of birth, grade level and school, school or activity photo, honors and awards, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, height and weight of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, and enrollment status. The law specifies, however, that certain non-sensitive “Directory Information” may be released for any purpose at the discretion of the school corporation, with general notification of such intent. Notification may consist of published policies such as this one.\n\nThe permission has been divided into two categories: Print and Electronic. Print publications include the yearbook or student newspaper, printed programs for extracurricular activities, news releases to the local media, district publications, and interviews with local news media. Electronic mediums (internet and broadcast) such as district website, district videos, podcasts, and interviews with local news media for broadcast such as TV or radio.\n\nYou have the right to request the withholding of any or all directory information. Please consider very carefully your decision to withhold any of the above information. This information is typically used in news stories about our students’ achievements and classroom activities, honor roll lists, the yearbook, and school directories and school/district newsletters. Should you deny permission for the release of information, any future requests for such information from news media and other individuals will be refused for the duration of the school year.\n\nTo request withholding of information, please notify your child’s school in writing within 14 days of the start of school or within 14 days of enrolling your students.\n\nDuring a student’s career, the school system collects and records data concerning the student. The school system recognizes that the collection, maintenance, and limited dissemination of such data is essential in school operations, but also that preserving the rights of privacy of the student and parents/guardians, and the student’s or parent’s/guardian’s right to correct inaccurate data is equally essential.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-7-3 (Senate Bill 204, 2001), a school corporation or other entity to which the education records privacy provisions of the federal Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g) apply may disclose or report on the education records of a child, including personally identifiable information contained in the education records, without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian, under the following conditions:\n\nThe disclosure or reporting of education records is to a state or local juvenile justice agency.\n\nThe disclosure or reporting relates to the ability of the juvenile justice system to serve, before adjudication, the student whose records are being released.\n\nThe juvenile justice agency receiving the information certifies, in writing, to the entity providing the information that the agency or individual receiving the information has agreed not to disclose it to a third party, other than another juvenile justice agency, without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian.\n\nFor purposes of subsection two (2), a disclosure or reporting of education records concerning a child who has been adjudicated as a delinquent child shall be treated as related to the ability of the juvenile justice system to serve the child before adjudication if the juvenile justice agency seeking the information provides sufficient information to enable the keeper of the education records to determine that the juvenile justice agency seeks the information in order to identify and intervene with the child as a juvenile at risk of delinquency rather than to obtain information solely related to supervision of the child as an adjudicated delinquent child.\n\nAs referenced in Policy E175 and in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), personally identifiable information about students is kept confidential. Parents and eligible students (a student who has reached 18 years of age) have the right to:\n\n(i) inspect and review the student’s education records at reasonable times within 45 days of the day a school receives a request to access records;\n\n(ii) seek amendment of the student’s education records believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights;\n\n(iii) provide written consent before the school discloses the student’s education records, except to the extent FERPA authorizes disclosures without consent; and\n\n(iv) file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, Family Policy Compliance Office, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington D.C. 20202, concerning alleged failures by the district to comply with the requirements of FERPA.\n\nCertain persons may examine student records without a parent’s consent. These include school officials, who have “legitimate educational interests.” A school official is a person employed by the school as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel) or a person serving on the school board. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the school who performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of personally identifiable information from education records, such as a software or technology service provider, an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist; or a parent, student, or other volunteer assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\n\nA parent or eligible student may view his/her student’s records by making a request in writing to the building principal. Any request for amendment of education records by requesting an informal conference with the Superintendent or designee.\n\nSpecial Education Services\n\nWWS accommodates the unique needs of students in special education ages 3-22 years of age in the students least restrictive environment, which means inclusion in general education classrooms as frequently as possible (case conference committee determination). Teachers use a common framework for education, but regularly—and creatively—adapt their instruction to accommodate the needs of the individual student. WWS is a single district planning corporation as it relates to special education services.\n\nDevelopmental Preschool Program (Child Find/Evaluation and Eligibility for special services): This program is for children ages 3-5 who qualify for special education services and is at Maple Glen Elementary School, Oak Trace Elementary School, Shamrock Springs Elementary School and Washington Woods Elementary School. Each student who qualifies is evaluated by our Early Childhood Assessment Tea (Child Find-Washington Woods Elementary School).\n\nWestfield Washington Schools also offers Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech and Language Therapy to students that qualify under an area of eligibility listed within Indiana Article 7.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools prepares all students for the day after graduation and emphasizes Life Readiness in order for all young people to be successful in our community. The student learning experience is shaped through cognitive and non-cognitive growth cultivated by opportunities provided by staff members on a daily basis at school. These opportunities will only be maximized through daily attendance. A student’s attendance is essential to learning -- learning that includes not only factual subject matter but also the skills needed for Life Readiness. Reading the material and performing satisfactorily on tests does not compensate for the loss of insight gained during guided instruction, class collaboration, or supervised work. Furthermore, every student contributes to one another; therefore, a student who is absent short-changes those who are not.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools bases its attendance policy on state code and Indiana Department of Education guidance. Indiana State Code requires children to attend school during the time it is in session until the child graduates or becomes 18 years of age. The Board of School Trustees, as an agency of the State, is required to enforce regular attendance of students. Absence from school is defined as any non-presence (excused or unexcused) during part or all of a scheduled school day that is not canceled or altered due to weather or other emergency.\n\nUsing both state code and IDOE guidance, Westfield Washington Schools establishes that all students must be in attendance for over 166 days of the 175 day school year, meaning that students should not miss more than 9 days in a year. The state of Indiana counts all absences alike, whether excused or unexcused. Not missing more than 9 days (whether excused or unexcused) ensures a student has an attendance percentage of 95% or higher; this percentage has been proven to maximize student learning. Westfield Washington Schools sees student attendance as the first and most important rule in creating the best learning experience for students.\n\nAny student who is absent for 10 full days or more, or for 10 individual class periods or more at the middle and high school level, puts their status as a student in good standing in jeopardy. As a result, the ability to participate in co-curricular or extracurricular events (including but not limited to clubs, athletics, performing arts, prom, et al.) may be revoked unless approved by an administrator.\n\nReporting Absences\n\nIt is the responsibility of the child’s parent to notify the school office when a student is absent. Please phone the attendance line at 317-867-6500 x13001 or email wisattendance@wws.k12.in.us by 9:00 a.m. the day of the student’s absence. A parent may call the attendance line and leave a voicemail 24 hours a day. A parent may call in his/her native language. Please give your name, phone number, your child’s name, your child’s homeroom teacher and the reason for the absence. Any absences not verified by a parent within 48 hours may be deemed as truant, which will compromise the ability of the students to make up work for credit.\n\nParents/Guardians are encouraged to provide a doctor’s excuse to the office for each absence that requires a visit to the doctor or other medical professional.\n\nPer state code, attendance policies are determined locally. It is a local decision to excuse or not excuse an absence.\n\nTypes of Absences\n\nIndiana State Code utilizes the terminology of Excused, Unexcused, and Truant for absences. As a result, Westfield Washington Schools utilizes the same terminology. Further explanation of these terms follows. Excused absences are verified by either a parent or a third party, such as a doctor and matching the board approved definition. Unexcused absences are unverified, or exceeding the allowed limit even if verified, or truancies.\n\nExcused Absences\n\nA parent call-in is required to excuse an absence\n\nStudent illness (with accompanying medical note preferred; accompanying med note is required if a student reaches 7 or more of any type of absences)\n\nDeath/grave illness of an immediate family member\n\nExclusion because of exposure to contagious disease\n\nRequired religious observation\n\nMedical, dental, or professional appointments. Please make every effort to schedule appointments outside of school hours.\n\nPre-arranged absences\n\nPre-arranged absences include vacations (not exceeding 7 days), club sports athletic tournaments, external performing arts opportunities, extended medical absences, job interviews and internship interviews. Any possible external verification for these types of absences is encouraged.\n\nParents/guardians are expected to plan vacations/college visits around the school schedule as absences are a serious interruption to the learning process.\n\nThe parent/guardian must call the school attendance office at least two school days in advance of any pre-arranged absence.\n\nPlanned vacation days shall be taken with the parent/guardian of the student.\n\nClass work shall be completed in advance of the pre-arranged absence or as teachers may determine.\n\nThe principal or assistant principal shall deny pre-arranged absence days to students having excessive absences or when vacation days will extend absences beyond the 7 day limit.\n\nOther Educational Activity\n\nOther educational activity is defined as any other absence, approved by the building principal or assistant principal, resulting from an educational activity that is relevant to the child’s academic growth and equivalent to the child’s school activities/experiences. Such absence requires prior notification at least two school days prior to the absence and proper verification. These types of absences will be coded uniquely, accounting for presence in class on those days and not accumulating towards the student’s absence total. The principal or assistant principal shall have discretion to rescind approval of the other educational activity status if the reporting is deemed insufficient, if the student already has excessive absences, or if the student is not in good academic standing.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-2-14, -15, -16, -17, students supplying the proper notification to the school office and participating in the following events are not counted absent:\n\nService as page or honoree of general assembly\n\nService to the election board or political candidate on Election Day\n\nWitness in judicial proceeding or any required court appearance for which a student is subpoenaed\n\nDuty with the Indiana National Guard (maximum 10 days).\n\nDuty with the Indiana wing of civil air patrol\n\nParticipation in the state fair\n\nA principal approved educationally sound activity\n\nParents/Guardians must notify the school with physician documentation when circumstances of prolonged student illness occur. This will assist the principal in employing this policy’s parent/guardian notice and intervention provisions.\n\nUnexcused Absences\n\nAn unexcused absence is any absence not covered under either the definition of excused absence or listed as an exception to compulsory attendance.\n\nThe following are considered unexcused absences:\n\nAny absence in excess of 10 previously accrued that is not excused by state law or accompanied with medical verification, or previously approved by principal.\n\nAny absence not recognized by state law or Westfield Washington Schools.\n\nStudents arriving to class 30 minutes late or more are considered absent for that class. This will be considered unexcused unless accompanied with the proper verification noted above.\n\nTruant\n\nTruancy is defined as an absence from school without the knowledge or consent of the parent/guardian and the school, or absent from school when there is an attempt to evade the Indiana Compulsory Attendance Law. The following circumstances are considered truancy:\n\nThe willful non-attendance by a student not to attend school. This act of non-compliance is not authorized an/or known by the parent/guardian\n\nA student does not report for an assigned class during the course of the school day.\n\nA student leaving the building and/or school grounds during the day without permission.\n\nA student misrepresents a pass and does not report to a designated location during the day. An example would be reporting 20 plus minutes late for a class or wandering in the school to a designated location.\n\nLate arrival to school may be considered an instance of truancy.\n\nStudents will be considered a “habitual truant if they are truant from school more than ten (10) days in the school year.\n\nKey Definitions:\n\nHabitual Truant: Habitual truant\" refers to a student who has been absent ten (10) days or more from school within a school year without being excused or without being absent under a parental request that has been filed with the school. (Indiana Code 20-18-2-6.5)\n\nChronic Absentee: The term Chronic Absentee refers to a student who has been absent 10% or more of the school days during the scholastic year (Indiana Department of Education)\n\nWestfield Washington Schools Truancy Prevention Policy\n\nEffective July 1, 2024, Indiana Code 20-33-2.5 establishes that each school corporation shall adopt a truancy prevention policy. Westfield Washington Schools champions student learning and preparation for Life after Graduation; as a result, every school will fulfill this plan as appropriate for grade level. Beyond state expectations, Westfield Washington Schools is committed to an informative and educational policy regarding student attendance. As a result, we incorporate three tiers to our system in order to best reach all families.\n\nTier 1: Every school will send all families returning to a district school a written attendance update at the end of each school’s term (trimester or quarter). These will be sent to emails on file. Transparency will be on display, with regular schoolwide data updates about attendance performance targets in principal newsletters.\n\nTier 2: Students who have missed five total days or more during the school term will be informed in writing. As this is cumulative throughout the year and not within one single grading period, this may not require further action unless otherwise indicated.\n\nTier 3:\n\nWestfield Washington Schools will initiate truancy prevention for any absent student who is absent 5 days (unexcused and/or unverified) within a trimester or quarter, depending on school. Westfield Washington Schools may also initiate truancy prevention for a student who has had 7 or more called-in absences, even if they are considered excused.\n\nStudents who are absent in conformity with a medical letter of incapacity to attend signed by a doctor, therapist, or other medical professional may be exempt from this.\n\nUpon the fifth unexcused absence, the process will be initiated with a written notification sent either virtually or on paper to the parents of the student, informing the parent of the student’s attendance record and reminding the parent of responsibility to monitor the student’s attendance and ensure the student attends school in accordance with compulsory attendance laws. This letter will invite response for a required in-person attendance conference to discuss an action plan of improvement. This letter will also include verbiage on the definition and action steps that must legally be taken if the student is considered a habitual truant, which includes reporting the student to an intake officer of the juvenile court or the department of child services in accordance with IC 20-33-2-25, and subsequent actions that may be taken by those entities upon referral by the school district.\n\nThe attendance conference will be held within five (5) school days of notification. The following individuals will be present in the conference:\n\nA representative of the school (principal, assistant principal, dean, and/or counselor)\n\nA teacher of the student (Grades K-6 only)\n\nThe student’s parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\nThe school will permit the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s) to elect to bring a representative who may provide insight into the student’s absenteeism if the student’s parent fulfills the following:\n\nMakes request to the school that the representative attend; and\n\nProvides notice to the school regarding the identification of the representative;\n\nat least forty-eight (48) hours before the attendance conference.\n\nDuring the meeting, an attendance contract will be developed; contract will be in effect for forty-five (45) days. Attendance contract may include expectations accompanied with extra supports and/or accountability measures.\n\nAt the secondary level, this may take place for students who have accrued five unexcused absences to a single class period.\n\nMake-Up Work\n\nClasswork and assignments are essential to the learning process. All work missed due to absence (excused, unexcused, or truancy) is expected to be completed. A student shall have one day to make up work for each day of absence. This guideline may be altered at the discretion of the principal and the teacher if it is determined that it is unreasonable for the student to complete all missing work within the allotted time. This guideline may also be altered for unexcused prearranged absences, such as vacations, in order for the learning process to remain as uninterrupted as possible. Students should utilize Canvas first to see the work they missed while they are out, completing what is possible to be completed if physically able. Lengthy absences may require that the teacher provide schoolwork alternatives and timeframes for completion. In such cases, the teacher will notify the student and the principal. Teachers will strive to ensure the alternative assignments assist the student in achieving course learning targets and set a reasonable timeframe for the completion of the work.\n\nIC 20-33-2 requires children to attend school during the time it is in session until the child graduates or becomes 18 years of age. We know that good attendance and high achievement are related. Student attendance at school is expected in order that learning within the classroom can occur. Because regular attendance is expected of our students, vacation taken during a school term is considered an unexcused absence. Absence from school is defined as any non-presence (excused or unexcused) during part or all of a scheduled school day that is not canceled or altered due to weather or other emergency. Tardiness is a form of absence that will be factored into consequences employed by the school.\n\nIn grades 5-12, students who are absent from school for more than three (3) periods may not attend or participate in any extracurricular activities on the day of absence without administrative approval.\n\nExcessive Absences\n\nExcessive absences can merit both school discipline as well as extra support. Any of the following disciplinary steps may occur:\n\nLoss of ability to participate in co-curricular and/or extracurricular activities/organizations; loss of ability to participate in field trips.\n\nAfter-school detention to make up missed time\n\nSaturday School for more built in study time\n\nAttendance Contract\n\nRequirement for parent/guardian to produce a certificate of incapacity not later than six (6) days after the certificate is demanded.\n\nLoss of driving privileges for students who are drivers\n\nReferral to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of invalidation of driver’s license\n\nRequirement for medical notes upon future absences.\n\nWellness check through WPD\n\nReferral to DCS\n\nReferral to Hamilton County ACES\n\nFiling of truancy with the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s office.\n\nSuspension and/or expulsion\n\nand progressive discipline will ensue. Truancy will count toward the absence limit.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools Attendance Procedures/Hamilton County Schools Attendance Program Project ACES – Attending Class Equals Success\n\nWestfield Washington Schools participates in the Hamilton County Schools Project ACES Attendance Program in collaboration with the Hamilton County Juvenile Prosecutor’s Office. Project ACES tracks the total number of excused/unexcused absences to school accumulated for the entire school year. The goal of Project ACES is to ensure that every child attends school as required by Indiana Law so that each child will receive the necessary guidance and knowledge to become a productive member of the community. Absences to school are cumulative throughout the school year and do not reset at any point during the school year for grades K-12.\n\nProject ACES is a collaboration between the school, parent, student, Westfield Youth Assistance Program, and the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office. In working together and through early intervention, we believe that attending class will equal success for each and every student.\n\nEach classroom teacher, in cooperation with his/her class and triad, sets up classroom expectations at the beginning of the year. These co-created expectations provide the foundation for a safe, equitable, and relationship driven learning environment.\n\nWWS is dedicated to the social and emotional development of all students to help them reach their full potential. This is an ongoing process focused on student, teacher, and parent / guardian cooperation and collaboration in the classroom, built on a foundation of positive relationships between school and home. Classroom teachers utilize a wide array of interventions to support positive behavior in the classroom. Some examples include, but are not limited to: relationship building, classroom circles, cooperative learning, restorative practices, goal setting, problem-solving, self-reflection, empathy building, mindful moments, etc.\n\nExpectations for Shared School Areas (hallways, restrooms, cafeteria, media center, midday)\n\nDemonstrate respect for everyone in the school.\n\nRespect all school property.\n\nRecognize and respect voice levels in all areas of the school.\n\nWalk, don’t run, in shared areas.\n\nKeep hands and feet to yourself.\n\nBe respectful during special programs.\n\nTeachers may use midday time to help students with academic needs.\n\nSupporting Student Behavioral Needs\n\nEach classroom teacher and bus driver establishes a system for his/her classroom or bus with rules expectations and age appropriate student supports. If a child experiences a lack of success with classroom / bus expectations, then additional supports may include:\n\nconference with child and teacher;\n\nconference, in person or by phone, with parent/guardian;\n\nletter to parent/guardian;\n\nloss of recess and/or special school privileges;\n\nloss of bus privileges if incident was bus related;\n\nassignment of tasks to complete such as letters of apology, school service project, etc.;\n\nafter-school detention;\n\nin-school suspension;\n\nout-of-school suspension;\n\nexpulsion\n\nIn the interest of maintaining a safe and healthy educational environment for all stakeholders, the administration reserves the right to conduct searches of school property based upon reasonable suspicion. The nature and manner in which the search is conducted shall be controlled by the circumstances of each particular situation.\n\nWWS Behavior and Disciplinary Policy (Policy C375)\n\nAs referenced in Policy C375, it is the policy of Westfield Washington Schools to balance the rights of student expression with that of all members of the school community, with the interests of an orderly and efficient educational process, and with the needs of a school environment suitable for the healthy growth and development of all students.\n\nAnti-Bullying (Policy C200)\n\nBullying is prohibited by Westfield Washington Schools. Students who commit any acts of bullying are subject to discipline including but not limited to suspension, expulsion, arrest, and/or prosecution.\n\nDefinition: “Bullying” is defined as overt, unwanted, repeated acts or gestures, including verbal or written communications or images transmitted in any manner (including digitally or electronically); physical acts committed; aggression; or any other behaviors committed by a student or group of students against another student with the intent to harass, ridicule, humiliate, intimidate, or harm the targeted student, creating for the targeted student an objectively hostile school environment that:\n\nplaces the targeted student in reasonable fear of harm to his or her person or property;\n\nhas a substantially detrimental effect on the targeted student’s physical or mental health;\n\nhas the effect of substantially interfering with the targeted student’s academic performance; or\n\nhas the effect of substantially interfering with the targeted student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by the school.\n\nApplicability: Westfield Washington Schools prohibits bullying in all forms. This policy may be applied regardless of the physical location in which the bullying behavior occurred, whenever the individual committing the bullying behavior and any of the intended targets of the bullying behavior are students attending a school within Westfield Washington Schools and disciplinary action is reasonably necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or prevent an unreasonable threat to the rights of others to a safe and peaceful learning environment. Westfield Washington Schools prohibits bullying through the use of data or computer software that is accessed through any computer, computer system, or computer network.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on bullying prevention and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (C200) can be found on the district’s BoardDocs website,https://go.boarddocs.com/in/wws/Board.nsf/Public\n\nChildren’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) (Policy A300)\n\nWWS recognizes its responsibility to educate students regarding appropriate behavior when using the Internet.

Such instruction shall include, but not be limited to, the dangers of posting personal information online, misrepresentation by online predators, how to report inappropriate or offensive content or threats, behaviors that constitute cyberbullying, and how to respond when subjected to cyberbullying.\n\nCriminal Organizations (Policy 10000-52)\n\nCriminal organizations are prohibited by Westfield Washington Schools. Students who commit any acts of criminal organization and criminal organization activity, or reprisal, or retaliation against an individual who reports suspected criminal organization activity are subject to discipline.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization” means a group with at least three (3) members that specifically: (1) Promotes, sponsors, or assists in; or participates in; (2) Requires as a condition of membership or continued membership; or (3) Has as one of its goals; The commission of a felony or an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult or the offense of battery.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization Activity” means knowing or intentional participation in a criminal organization, or knowing or intentional solicitation, recruitment, enticement, or intimidation of another individual to join a criminal organization.\n\nApplicability: The Board of School Trustees of Westfield Washington Schools prohibits criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior on school property, on school buses, and/or at school-sponsored functions and prohibits reprisal or retaliation against individuals who report criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior or who are victims, witnesses, bystanders, or other people with reliable information about an act of criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on criminal organization activity and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform site located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (10000-52) can be found on the district website, www.wws.k12.in.us, under School Board/Policy Information.\n\nFirearms, Weapons, and Destructive Devices (Policy A200)\n\nPolicy:\n\nNo student shall possess, handle or transmit any firearm, deadly weapon or destructive device on school property, on a school bus, or WWS events even if held outside school property.\n\nNo student shall possess any object which is either intended, or may in fact be used as, or looks like a weapon or other instrumentality which could cause harm to any other person on school property, on a school bus, or WWS events even if held outside school property.

The term includes a dagger, dirk, poniard, stiletto, switchblade knife, or gravity knife.\n\nIn addition to being subjected to criminal charges, any student who violates this policy shall be subject to expulsion or suspension.\n\nDue Process\n\nIt is important that students be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities. The Student Due Process Code (IC 20-33-8), enacted and amended by the General Assembly of Indiana, outlines in detail the procedures to be followed when either suspension or expulsion is utilized as a disciplinary measure. Once due process is initiated, a student will not be permitted to withdraw from school to avoid disciplinary action except in Policy C375, Student Behavior, Rights, and Discipline. Due process procedures begin at the time a student is questioned in relation to an incident.\n\nIn August 2006 the School Board instituted a practice not to hear student due process appeals for expulsion.\n\nLegal Settlement (IC 20-33-8-17) (Policy C125)\n\nA student may be expelled from school if the student’s legal settlement is not in the attendance area of the school corporation where the student is enrolled.

Policy C375 covers student behaviors, rights, and discipline.\n\nNon-Discrimination & Anti-Harassment (Policy 13000-01)\n\nWWS does not discriminate on the basis of a protected class including but not limited to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, ancestry, sex, transgender status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression in its programs or activities. WWS strictly adheres to all non-discrimination and anti-harassment laws and does not tolerate acts of harassment. WWS is committed to providing a safe environment in which students can learn. WWS shall maintain a nondiscriminatory environment protecting students from discrimination and harassment.\n\nHarassment and discrimination may take many forms, including: verbal acts and name-calling; graphic and written statements; sexual violence or unwanted sexual contact; or other conduct that may be harmful, humiliating, or physically threatening. Harassment and discrimination do not have to include intent to harm, be directed at a specific target, or involve repeated incidents, but may be present in peer-to-peer, staff-to-staff, staff-to-student, or student-to-staff interactions. Harassment and discrimination may be any act, speech, or gesture sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities provided by WWS.\n\nProcedural Response:\n\nPlease see Policy 13000-01 for a full description of the procedure to investigate a complaint of harassment\n\nAll complaints will be followed up on and the following steps will be taken.
