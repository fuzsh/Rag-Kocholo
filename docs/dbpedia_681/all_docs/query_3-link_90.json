        "text": "Advertisements\n\nI am trying to decide between many top school districts- millburn, westfield, chatham, new providence etc. I am having troubles deciding how different these schools really are when it comes to school stress. I want my children to work very hard and if they get into AP's eventually that is great, but I hear that each school presents different levels of stress even though they all are top schools. I have friends in Millburn, and they say the stress really picks up in 6th grade. This seems early and have a hard time thinking my 6th grader should endure this at such a young age. Is this true for Westfield, Chatham etc? Are they all the same in the end if your child goes into accelerated/honors and eventually AP programs. Or schools outside of Millburn make more an effort to keep the stress levels out of the middle school, and allow it to pick up in highschool if the child chooses to pursue higher level AP classes.\n\nI don't know what to do as Millburn gives my family the best commute, has great services nearby (ie. traders joes, all banks, town center, library, train station etc), and more diverse. Other towns feel more removed as we both commute to city and would add about 15 minutes to our commutes.\n\nPlease comment on school stress for each district from middle school on....\n\nMillburn/Short Hills\n\nChatham\n\nWestfield\n\nSummit\n\nI have kids in the Millburn school system. They are very different. One of my children is intellectually curious, sharp, scientific minded and observant. He's a little scattered but gets As and Bs. If he was my only child, my perception of MMS would be an easy one: Aplus. I'm forever amazed at the level in which he's being taught....from content to methodology. Lots of homework but not so that he doesn't have time for sports. He has nice friends....a little geeky but polite, responsible and self assured. Our experience with him has been beyond excellent and I think they've takrn a kid that might have been bored elsewhere and turned him into a responsible student with good command of himself.\n\nMy other child is artsy and she's struggled much more. She finds the work level to be too much....too detailed, too expanded, too much everything. She's struggled socially even though she's adorable and kind and a good kid. But she's absent minded and her sharp friends have little tolerances of it. This is not an easy place for a kid that has their heads in the clouds....\n\nGood resources if you have an IEp. Nice kids. Kind teachers.....\n\nThe extracurricular stuff is all through town..which is ok other than it might have helped my daughter socially.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMany of the top schools in New Jersey put a lot of pressure and stress on the students. Not only is it for academic reasons, but for social reasons as well.\n\nMillburn is notorious for this. They felt a lot of pressure to be the #1 high school in New Jersey.\n\nSchool community takes a hard look at stress - News - NorthJersey.com\n\nThere’s even a Twitter account devoted to the stress.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/millerprobz\n\nNow that Chatham is #1, I’m sure the stress will increase exponentially, although this article shows the stress was already there in 2008:\n\nTeen Stress - A New Epidemic | Patch\n\nSummit Middle School:\n\nLCJSMS Guidance:*Summit\n\nWestfield High School:\n\nWHS Looks to Tackle Student Stress | Patch\n\nEven though you didn’t ask about West Windsor/Plainboro, I found a recent New York Times article illuminating. Now the parents are at odds with each other, and it’s apparently broken down along racial lines:\n\nNew Jersey School District Eases Pressure on Students, Baring an Ethnic Divide - The New York Times\n\nOther school systems you can check out: Madison and Cranford.\n\nOf course, all of these school systems are terrific in lovely places, with mostly walkable downtowns.\n\nI know people in all of them (with children in middle and high school).\n\nMIllburn is the most competitive, and \"diverse\" in terms of huge % Asian and Indian.\n\nSummit is the most diverse, economically. Schooling is good, not excellent, but with that parents may have more diverse expectations (vs. in Millburn where the type A parents all want the same thing - Excellence - and their student to be #1).\n\nWestfield similar to Summit, but the lower-end economic group is smaller.\n\nChatham will have the \"popular\" types, ie, connected, social parents with excellent jobs (and many SAHM in all these districts). Very good schooling.\n\nMadison will not be as competitive and is a smaller town, and good sense of community.\n\nNew Providence will be the most normal and is a much smaller school district than the others.\n\nThat's just my observations based on many conversations with residents of those towns.\n\nLast edited by snuffybear; 12-30-2015 at 06:07 PM.."
