        "text": "The Westfield School is an amazing school for students that want to go to a very selective college or university. It is also a great option for Christian families because we are able to freely worship with no discrimination. The Westfield School is welcoming, and, even though I’ve only been here for 3 years, it feels like I have known my classmates for my entire life. I know I can always turn to my peers for an support that I need.\n\nThe Westfield School Is a great college preparatory school. My school also isn’t just about school, it’s about coming together. I feel like my school is my family. I say this because everyone loves one another and has no hatred. If I had to change one thing, it would be doing more activities that the whole school can enjoy!"
