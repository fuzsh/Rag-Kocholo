This policy may be applied regardless of the physical location in which the bullying behavior occurred, whenever the individual committing the bullying behavior and any of the intended targets of the bullying behavior are students attending a school within Westfield Washington Schools and disciplinary action is reasonably necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or prevent an unreasonable threat to the rights of others to a safe and peaceful learning environment. Westfield Washington Schools prohibits bullying through the use of data or computer software that is accessed through any computer, computer system, or computer network.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on bullying prevention and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board Policy (C200) can be found on the district website, www.wws.k12.in.us, under School Board/Policy Information.\n\nNon-Discrimination & Anti-Harassment (Policy 13000-01)\n\nWWS does not discriminate on the basis of a protected class including but not limited to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, ancestry, sex, transgender status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression in its programs or activities. WWS strictly adheres to all non-discrimination and anti-harassment laws and does not tolerate acts of harassment. WWS is committed to providing a safe environment in which students can learn. WWS shall maintain a nondiscriminatory environment protecting students from discrimination and harassment.\n\nHarassment and discrimination may take many forms, including: verbal acts and name-calling; graphic and written statements; sexual violence or unwanted sexual contact; or other conduct that may be harmful, humiliating, or physically threatening. Harassment and discrimination do not have to include intent to harm, be directed at a specific target, or involve repeated incidents, but may be present in peer-to-peer, staff-to-staff, staff-to-student, or student-to-staff interactions. Harassment and discrimination may be any act, speech, or gesture sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with or limit the ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities provided by WWS.\n\nPlease see Policy 13000-01 for a full description of the procedure to investigate a complaint of harassment\n\nAll complaints will be followed up on and the following steps will be taken. They may not always follow this order.\n\nReport\n\nSupportive interim measures\n\nInvestigation\n\nSupportive Measures\n\nConsequences\n\nCommunication with parents/guardians to inform/update on investigation\n\nFollow up with students involved\n\nNote: All reports are taken seriously and investigated.\n\nFactors Involved in Decision Making Process (not limited to):\n\nStudent’s age(s)\n\nRelationship between parties\n\nSpecific offense and circumstances of incident, including if this is a repeated incident\n\nVerbal or physical conduct\n\nThe effect on the targetThe degree of harm caused\n\nStudent’s prior disciplinary record\n\nInput from persons in parental relation, teachers, mental health professionals, as appropriate I\n\nSpecial circumstances such as if the Disability status (determine whether behavior is directly related to disability)\n\nStaff members involved\n\nStudent privacy considerations under FERPA\n\nWWS recognizes that consequences are a natural result of behavioral misconduct, and consequences need to be paired with teaching and additional support for the purpose of changing chronic misbehavior. As administrators take into account the factors involved, a range of consequences and supportive measures have been developed following school and state board policies. This list of consequences and supportive measures are not all inclusive therefore administrative discretion will be applied as needed. WWS will follow all applicable laws and regulations in regard to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) when communicating with students, families, and community. Therefore, WWS is unable to disclose educational records and/or personally identifiable information to third parties (including but not limited to: consequences received, supporting measures put in place, details of the incident, etc.).\n\nThe entire School Board policy (13000-01), including coordinator contact information, can be found on the district website, www.wws.k12.in.us, under School Board/Policy Information.\n\nChildren’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) (Policy A300)\n\nWWS recognizes its responsibility to educate students regarding appropriate behavior when using the Internet. Therefore, students shall be provided instruction about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking sites, user forums, chat sites, and about cyberbullying awareness and response.\n\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide age-appropriate instruction regarding safe and appropriate behavior on social networking sites, user forums, chat sites, and other internet services. Such instruction shall include, but not be limited to, the dangers of posting personal information online, misrepresentation by online predators, how to report inappropriate or offensive content or threats, behaviors that constitute cyberbullying, and how to respond when subjected to cyberbullying.\n\nCriminal Organizations (Policy 10000-52)\n\nCriminal organizations are prohibited by Westfield Washington Schools. Students who commit any acts of criminal organization and criminal organization activity, or reprisal, or retaliation against an individual who reports suspected criminal organization activity are subject to discipline.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization” means a group with at least three (3) members that specifically: (1) Promotes, sponsors, or assists in; or participates in; (2) Requires as a condition of membership or continued membership; or (3) Has as one of its goals; The commission of a felony or an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult or the offense of battery.\n\nDefinition: “Criminal Organization Activity” means knowing or intentional participation in a criminal organization, or knowing or intentional solicitation, recruitment, enticement, or intimidation of another individual to join a criminal organization.\n\nApplicability: The Board of School Trustees of Westfield Washington Schools prohibits criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior on school property, on school buses, and/or at school-sponsored functions and prohibits reprisal or retaliation against individuals who report criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior or who are victims, witnesses, bystanders, or other people with reliable information about an act of criminal organization activity and similar destructive or illegal group behavior.\n\nEducation: Westfield Washington Schools will provide training and/or instruction on criminal organization activity and policy to all students in grades 1-12, as well as staff, in accordance with Indiana law.\n\nReporting: In an effort to maintain an orderly and safe environment, students and parents/guardians can report incidents to the anonymous reporting platform site located on the district website homepage.\n\nThe entire School Board policy (10000-52) can be found on the district website, www.wws.k12.in.us, under School Board/Policy Information.\n\nDue Process (Policy C375)\n\nIt is important that students be aware of their legal rights and responsibilities. The Student Due Process Code IC 20-33-8 enacted and amended by the General Assembly of Indiana outlines in detail the procedures to be followed when either suspension or expulsion is utilized as a disciplinary measure. Once due process is initiated, a student will not be permitted to withdraw from school to avoid disciplinary action except in Policy C375, Student Behavior, Rights, and Discipline. Due process procedures begin at the time a student is questioned in relation to an incident.\n\nVocational School & Cooperative Programs Discipline\n\nThe Metropolitan School District of Washington Township shall conduct student due process procedures for students attending the J. Everett Light Career Center and students may be charged with violation of policies, rules and regulations of M.S.D. Washington Township and J. Everett Light Career Center. Students attending the vocational programs through J. Everett Light Career Center are subject to that school’s policies and procedures.\n\nAction taken by M.S.D. Washington Township to suspend or expel a student shall subject the student to similar or the same action by Westfield High School as determined by the principal. In the event suspension or expulsion is pursued, due process procedures will be followed. A student suspended or against whom action has been taken for expulsion from Westfield High School shall also have his/her actions examined by the administration at the J. Everett Light Career Center.\n\nExpulsion-Legal Settlement (IC 20-33-8-17) (Policy C125)\n\nA student may be expelled from school if the student’s legal settlement is not in the attendance area of the school corporation where the student is enrolled. Expulsion will not be undertaken if the student voluntarily is withdrawn by the parents/guardians within five calendar days of discovery.\n\nGrounds for Suspension/Expulsion\n\nGrounds for suspension or expulsion are student misconduct and/or substantial disobedience. Examples of student misconduct and/or substantial disobedience for which a student may be suspended or expelled include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.

The superintendent may reduce the length of the expulsion if the circumstances warrant such reduction.\n\ne. The superintendent shall notify the county prosecuting attorney’s office when a student is expelled under this rule.\n\nIn addition to the grounds listed above for expulsion or suspension, a student may be suspended or expelled for engaging in unlawful activity on or off school grounds if the unlawful activity may reasonably be considered to be an interference with school purposes or an educational function or the student’s removal is necessary to restore order or protect persons on school property. This includes any unlawful activity meeting the above criteria which takes place during weekends, holidays, or other school breaks and functions.\n\nSuspension, expulsion, and student discipline are governed by IC 20-33-8 and Westfield Washington Schools policies and procedures are in compliance with that statute. Copies of the entire Indiana Statute are available at the administrative office. Policy C375 covers student behaviors, rights, and discipline.\n\nIn August 2006, the School Board instituted a practice not to hear student due process appeals for expulsion.\n\nThe instructional day begins at 8:35, with direct supervision beginning at 8:15 when students are released from the bus. The instructional day ends at 3:39.\n\nBuilding Tours\n\nTours of Westfield High School for families new to the corporation can be arranged by calling our Information Desk at 317-867-6800 x11083.\n\nHallway Expectations\n\nStudents in the hallway during class time will be expected to have a pass.\n\nNo running in the halls will be permitted.\n\nNo food or drink is to be consumed in the halls.\n\nWhen school is over, students are to leave immediately unless staying for detention, testing center, extra help from a teacher, or extra curricular club, sport, or activity starting immediately after school\n\nIf a student is in an unsupervised area without permission, he/she will be held accountable under the context of truancy per the discipline code.\n\nLeaving School Building or Grounds\n\nWestfield High School has a closed campus. Students are not permitted to leave the school grounds without permission of the administration. The only students who shall have permission to leave the school are those with clinical appointments, students who become ill at school, students leaving as an extension of their educational program, and students who have obtained special permission from an administrator, following a parent/guardian conference. No student, regardless of age, is allowed to leave without permission of the school administration.\n\nWhen it is necessary for students to leave school when classes are in session for appointments of various natures, the following procedure will be in effect to govern such instances:\n\nThe student is required to sign-out in the office prior to leaving school. Failure to sign-out will result in the student being considered truant. No student, regardless of age, is allowed to leave without permission of the school administration. If time missed has not been approved and recorded, the student will be counted as truant. This rule applies to before and after school. Once you arrive at school you are not to leave the school grounds until you are going home.\n\nThe parent/guardian shall notify the school by telephone and/or note of appointment date, time, and location. It is recommended that parent/guardian call in any early dismissal by 10:00 a.m. the day of the dismissal in order for the student to leave in a timely fashion. The student should return to school when the appointment is completed and continue the regular school day. Students should bring confirmation slips from the dentist or doctor upon returning to school. Failure to bring confirmation slips from the dentist or doctor will result in unexcused absences for classes missed.\n\nCORE Time Rules & Guidelines\n\nCORE Time for students will be on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Friday during the school day from 1:52 - 2:27. During this time, each student will be assigned an Advisory teacher for the whole year. They can also sign up to work with their subject area teachers for extra help or specific study sessions. They will also have the opportunity to utilize our Testing Center during this time. Certain days, students will also benefit from Freshman Mentoring or Sophomore programming and will be able to meet as academic or interest clubs as well. CORE Time was designed to help all students be successful; therefore, academic work and teacher assignment of CORE Time will take precedence over club or activity meetings. It is the policy of Westfield High School that all students should take advantage of this time. Failure to attend an assigned CORE Time will result in disciplinary action.\n\nVehicle Idling\n\nDrivers of all public and private vehicles are to turn off the engine if the vehicle is to be stopped more than five (5) minutes in locations where vehicle exhaust may be drawn into the building or while on school grounds.\n\nEmergency School Delay/Cancellation/Dismissal\n\nThe cancellation or late beginning of school will be broadcast via the best method available. Parents will also be contacted through School Messenger, our emergency contact system. Parents are encouraged to keep phone contacts updated in PowerSchool. Please do not call the superintendent’s office or school office to ask about the closing of school.\n\nCertain situations may require releasing students from school before the end of the day or relocating them from one school building to another. If students are released early or relocated, the school district will notify parents by providing information via School Messenger. Information will also be available on the school corporation website and through social media channels.\n\nIf there is an emergency school closing during school hours, it is imperative that your child knows exactly what he/she is supposed to do.\n\nExample 1: If your child is to go home he/she would always have a key or know where one is kept.\n\nExample 2: If your child is not to go home he/she must know where he/she is supposed to go.\n\nIf you transport your child to and from school, please make arrangements with someone who will always be able to pick him/her up.\n\nEmergency closing arrangement information on each student is requested from each parent/guardian the first week of school. Please keep this and other emergency information up to date during the school year in PowerSchool.\n\nIf a bus driver or other school person believes a child may be harmed by releasing him or her from a bus or school, and the parent or guardian is not present, alternative arrangements may be made. The parent or guardian will pay any cost for these services.\n\nSchool Visitors\n\nAs a general rule, visitors are not allowed at Westfield High School between the hours of 8:35 a.m. and 3:39 p.m. without an appointment. Please call the school office and let us know when you would like to talk to a teacher, the principal, or counselor so a time can be arranged. If you have an appointment with a faculty or staff member, please check in at the Information Desk and the staff member will be notified of your arrival.\n\nA SafeVisitor background check will be required for anyone who visits our schools and will spend unsupervised time with any student, including family members of our students. Examples of activities in the schools where visitors will need a completed SafeVisitor background check are listed below:\n\nField Trip Chaperones\n\nAthletic or Student Activities Parent Volunteers\n\nExamples of activities that will not require a formal background check are listed below (these visitors will still follow normal school check-in procedures):\n\nClassroom Guest Speakers\n\nParent/Teacher Conferences/Case Conferences\n\nSchool Programs\n\nVisiting school office area or dropping off items at the school\n\nBackground checks are good for four years at any school in the district. These background checks will cost $12.95 (additional fees may apply) and can be acquired via the link below.\n\nPlease note - this process could take 3 to 6 business days. Once approved, please be on the lookout for a badge notification email from “info@safevisitorsolutions.com.” Your badge will be attached as a PDF. You can either print it, save it on your phone, or download the SafeVisitor app. A photo will be required and added upon your first visit to the school.\n\nWeb address for SafeVisitor process: https://secure.safevisitorsolutions.com/Safe/Volunteer/003471/volunteer\n\nYou can find more information at www.wws.k12.in.us/Page/1474\n\nFor the safety of students in the school, all visitors must show picture identification (e.g. driver’s license) and check in at the Information Desk immediately upon arriving. Visitors must ring a buzzer and state name and reason for entering the school. Each visitor registers in a logbook in the office and is issued a visitor’s badge that must be worn during the visit and is returned prior to leaving. This procedure is followed for each visit to the school.\n\nVisitors (including parents/guardians) are not permitted to eat lunch with students inside the school building during the school day. No visitor may conduct any type of student interview or take photographs until permission has been granted by the administration. Anyone in violation of the visitor policy will be asked to leave and could face the penalty of criminal prosecution.\n\nStudent Visitors\n\nStudents at Westfield High School are not allowed to have visitors without permission from the administration.\n\nAccident Insurance for Students\n\nStudent accident insurance is available to all students at a nominal cost. This insurance is made available as a courtesy to you and is not sponsored by the school.\n\nThe school carries no coverage on your child and can make no payments to cover medical costs. The insurance plan offered covers accidents that require medical attention that happen at school and on the bus. An application can be completed on the district website under Parents/Important Documents.\n\nAthletes and cheerleaders must either purchase the insurance or have their parents/guardians sign the Parent/Guardian Consent and Release Form on the IHSAA Physical Form stating that they have other accident insurance and will assume financial responsibility, in case of accidental injury. A form is available in the athletic director’s office for those desiring the waiver. The school does not carry insurance for loss of personal property.\n\nCanvas\n\nCanvas is our learning management system. Parents can choose to create a Canvas observer account in order to see their student’s assignment due dates, teacher feedback on graded assignments, class announcements, and other course content. To learn more about Canvas observer accounts, click here.\n\nCurricular Materials and Student Fees\n\nThe Indiana Department of Education covers the cost of curricular materials for students. Parents will be invoiced for student fees, covering consumable and perishable items in a student’s classes. Full payment or a payment plan should be completed by the end of the first\n\nsix weeks of school.\n\nIf a student's schedule changes during the year, fees may be adjusted based on the new classes. The parent may incur an additional cost or be due a credit. If a credit is on the account, a refund will be issued by the end of June.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools requires all unpaid fees not on a payment plan to be sent to a collection agency by the end of the school year. Any account turned over to collections will have an additional $10.00 fee added to its outstanding balance.\n\nIf a student is withdrawn from school, the parent will receive a prorated refund for any consumable item that has not been used. However, many consumable materials used in classes lose their value once they have been used for any part of a class.\n\nStudent fees are established annually and approved by the Board of School Trustees. Payment is collected at the district level. Payment can be made at the administration building with cash, check, credit card (Visa/Mastercard/Discover), or by completing a payment contract. Payment can also be made online through the PowerSchool interface. Payments made via credit card will be subject to credit card fees.\n\nElectronic Devices\n\nMaximizing instructional time is vital for the student learning experience. As that is the case, our electronic device policy is crafted to maximize student learning and is in accordance with Indiana state code, enacted July 1st, 2024.\n\nStudents are assigned one-to-one devices which should be used for educational purposes. Students are prohibited from using a \"wireless communication device\" (as defined by Indiana law), or cell phone, during instructional time, defined as any class period or CORE time. Teachers may allow students to use cellular phones or wireless communication devices for educational purposes during instructional time with administrative approval. No text messaging, audio recording, or videos may be used at any time. Any electronic device can be confiscated if used inappropriately. If school personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe a student has used an electronic device to violate a school rule or interfere with school purpose, that device may be confiscated and subject to reasonable search. All parts of the item(s) will be confiscated which includes batteries and memory cards. Confiscated items (when released by school officials) must be picked up by a parent/guardian. If you or your child decides to send such devices, understand that the school is not liable for any loss or damage to the device, and the Technology Use Form must be completed in PowerSchool. All devices should be clearly labeled with the owner's name.\n\nCell phones and/or other wireless communications devices must be turned off and out of sight during each class period and the student will be held accountable to the discipline code. Checking time, calculator use, or other cell phone functions will be considered usage.\n\nCell phones and/or other wireless communication devices may be used during the 7-minute passing periods, lunch time in the cafeteria and when not in a classroom. Cell phone usage during this time will be considered a privilege that can be revoked if appropriate cell phone etiquette is not used. In rare circumstances, students are permitted to use a wireless communication device: (1) In the event of an emergency, (2) to manage a student's health care; (3) if included in a student's IEP, (4) if included in the student's plan developed under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and (5) if otherwise required by law.\n\nIt is always preferred that if parents need to contact a student (or vice versa) during class time due to an emergency situation, they are to contact the receptionist (317-867-6800 x11000) and a pass will be provided for the student to come to the office and take the call.\n\nSchool Messenger\n\nSchool Messenger is the WWS electronic parent/guardian notification system. Emergency notifications, weather delays, closings, student documentation, general building information and district information are sent via voice messaging, text messages and email notification to the phone numbers and email addresses provided. Email is generally used for non-emergency situations (i.e. weekly newsletters or district announcements). For an emergency or immediate activity, the system calls the parents/guardians’ listed number and sends a text to the cell phone number provided. Please be sure to keep accurate email addresses and phone numbers in PowerSchool. Parents/guardians can update their email and phone number by notifying the front desk of their child’s school.\n\nTalkingPoints\n\nWestfield Washington Schools uses TalkingPoints as a multilingual communication tool between teachers and families. Families can choose to receive messages via SMS text messaging or through the free FAMILIES/TalkingPoints mobile app for Apple or Android. To ensure messages are received from your child’s teachers, make sure your contact information for the “Father” and “Mother” fields in PowerSchool are correct. When a teacher sends a message, TalkingPoints will automatically use these two phone numbers. If you would like to add additional contacts, please reach out to your child’s teachers.\n\nTechnology Guidelines\n\nThe use of technology is a privilege available to all students. Abuse or misuse of the equipment, policies or rules will lead to a loss of privileges or disciplinary action by the Westfield High School administration. Students and their parents/guardians are responsible for the cost of repair or the cost of replacement of any damage incurred either by vandalism or carelessness. All technology use is governed by the Responsible Use of Technology and Internet Use Policy A300. This policy includes, but is not limited to: telephones, cellular devices, digital media players, tablets, laptop and desktop computers and workstations, direct radio communication, Internet access, voice mail, e-mail, text messaging, direct messaging through device applications, facsimile transmission and receipt, artificial intelligence, including\n\nlanguage-generation tools and large language models, and any computer based research and/or communication. Please refer to the DISCIPLINE CODE/VIOLATIONS section of this handbook for the penalty of violating this policy.\n\nStudent owned personal devices and Corporation technology shall be used by students under teacher supervision with the purpose of improving instruction and student learning. A copy of the Policy and Parental Consent form is available in PowerSchool.\n\nWWS Email Addresses\n\nWestfield Washington Schools currently provides email services to all high school students. Student use of email is governed by the Acceptable Use of Technology and Internet Use Policy 13000-03 which will be enforced accordingly. District email is intended to communicate with teachers and other outside entities that are associated with the students’ education. Some examples of outside entities include, but are not limited to; Naviance, College Board, Lions Lead, Indiana Online Academy, and SchoolCore.\n\nTeachers will determine how email will be used in their classes.\n\nThe following are examples of inappropriate uses of email.\n\nSending sensitive or confidential information.\n\nConcealment or misrepresentation of names or affiliations (e.g., misrepresenting oneself as another user)\n\nUse of email to send spam\n\nAlteration of source or destination address of email\n\nUse of email that violates the district’s Anti-Bullying policy (C200)\n\nUse of email to violate local, state or federal law.\n\nAudio/Video Technology\n\nThe use of all audio/video technology is a privilege available to all students. Students and their parents/guardians are responsible for the cost of repair or replacement of any damages incurred either by vandalism or carelessness. Students may use editing stations and/or other technology resources areas if a teacher or other designated supervising adult is present in the area. Audio/video equipment may be reserved and checked out for educational purposes only. Reservations must be made in writing with the TSG staff.\n\nEvery Student Succeeds Act\n\nWestfield Washington Schools must comply with the Every Student Succeeds Act. Information regarding out-of-school suspensions and/or expulsions will remain part of each student’s permanent record that begins in kindergarten and concludes when a student graduates, transfers outside the district, or is expelled. Information about in-school suspensions or punishments by individual teachers, such as an after-school detention, is not part of the permanent record. These records will not appear on transcripts of grades which colleges receive. This information will be shared with other schools only when the student transfers. For more information, contact the Director of Student Services at 867-8006.\n\nField Trips\n\nAs an integral part of the instructional program, various classes take field trips during the course of the school year. Field trips are designed to add to the instruction and do not simply represent “getting out of school.” Specific assignments are normally made as part of the field trip. Trips vary considerably in length from one class period to as much as several periods. Depending on the nature of the field trip and available finances, a charge is sometimes assessed for admission and transportation costs.\n\nTeachers are responsible for scheduling field trips, making specific assignments, and specifying appropriate apparel for the field trip. In the determination of appropriate apparel, teachers will consider the nature of the trip and what will convey the best public impression of Westfield High School students. Students who elect not to conform to the specified apparel will remain at school and follow their normal schedules.\n\nA student who has accrued five or more absences in any given trimester or ten or more absences for the current school year (excused or unexcused) may be withheld by administration from participating in field trips. Administrators reserve the right not to allow a student to go on a field trip due to issues such as attendance, tardies, or discipline.\n\nParents/Guardians are encouraged to go along on these trips to help supervise the children. If you are interested in helping with a trip, please contact your child’s teacher. All parents/guardians serving as chaperones must complete the Safe Visitor background check as described above in the “School Visitor” section. For safety and supervision reasons, younger siblings are not permitted to attend field trips.\n\nIt is School Board policy that all children going on field trips have a signed permission slip. These forms must be signed by the parent/guardian and returned by the day of the trip. *A student without proof of proper immunizations is considered in violation of IC 20-34-4-5 students will not be allowed to attend field trips and/or extracurricular activities until immunization records are up to date and on file with the school nurse.\n\nLockers\n\nAll lockers and storage areas provided for student use on school premises remain the property of the school and are provided for student use; they are subject to inspection, access for maintenance, and search. For security reasons, lockers are not to be shared. Throughout the school year lockers must be kept in the same condition that they were in when they were assigned to the student.\n\nStudents are allowed to use magnets to customize their lockers; however, no one shall apply stickers, tape, or write on the lockers at any time. Periodic locker inspections will be held, and students will be charged for damages that are noted during the inspection.\n\nLost and Found\n\nThe “lost and found” area is located in the main office/and or cafeteria. Students who have misplaced something should check with the office staff on a regular basis. Students are encouraged to return “found” articles to the main office. To a great extent, all public schools operate on the honor system.\n\nStudents are strongly discouraged from bringing large sums of money or other valuable items to school. Westfield High School will not be responsible for articles that are lost or stolen. Items in the lost and found are taken to Goodwill at the end of each trimester.\n\nLost or Damaged Curricular Materials\n\nBooks and materials are issued by the classroom teacher and must be returned to the same teacher upon completion of the school year or withdrawal from school. Responsibility for textbooks rests with the student to whom the textbooks are issued. Loss of books or materials due to theft or other circumstances will not be accepted as an excuse for nonpayment or the failure to complete assignments.\n\nFailure on the part of any student to pay for lost or damaged books shall deprive the student of further use of textbooks and material. If a textbook is lost, before another one is issued, the student will be required to pay the cost of replacing the textbook. If the book is found and returned, a refund will be made to the student. If the book is damaged, the student is required to pay a damage charge depending upon the degree of damage and the condition of the book when it was issued.\n\nStudents are required to have textbooks and other materials and equipment in class necessary to perform the daily lesson.\n\nOperation of a Motor Vehicle & Student Parking\n\nThe right to drive a motor vehicle is controlled by the State of Indiana. The operation of a motor vehicle is controlled by various regulations and laws for the safety of all concerned and should be viewed as a privilege.\n\nStudents who plan to drive to school at any time during the school year shall register their vehicle(s) in the main office, and must have a parking permit displayed in the car window. The student must fill out the appropriate form and pay a registration fee. Parking spaces are limited. If there are more students registered than actual spaces available, the administration will assign parking permits based on specific criteria. Vehicles are to be properly aligned in the assigned areas. Students who abuse their parking assignment or do not have the proper permit displayed in the car window, may have their vehicle removed from school property at their expense.\n\nStudents are not permitted in their cars during any part of the school day without permission from an administrator. Upon arriving at school, students are to lock and leave their cars immediately. The student parking lot is for the parking of cars only. The students are not to congregate in the parking lot before, during, or after school. Students who fail to abide by these rules and regulations or who operate their vehicle in an unsafe manner will lose the privilege of driving their vehicles to and from school. Students who lose their driving privileges must ride the bus or be transported to/from school by their parent(s)/guardian(s).\n\nAll students who register for parking privileges are subject to random drug screening at Westfield High School.\n\nStudents who are habitually tardy or have attendance or discipline issues may forfeit their right to drive or receive their parking pass at any time.\n\nSchool Telephone Use\n\nThe office phone is available for students during the passing period or directly before/after school. Students are not allowed to be tardy to class due to using the phone. Students may not use the school phones during instructional time without permission from a teacher. Any student using the office phone improperly will be held accountable per the discipline code.\n\nSigns/Posters/Flyers\n\nOnly official school clubs will have permission to post 8” x 11” signs/posters/flyers after approval from the Assistant Principal. Approved signs must have a verification stamp, received at the front information desk. The signs shall be posted only in the designated areas in the learning center or main cafeteria unless special permission has been granted. Signs can remain up for a maximum of 14 days and must be taken down by the group that put up the sign.\n\nStudent Speech & Press\n\nThe Board of School Trustees recognizes the students' rights to freedom of speech and press; however, these rights are limited when the rights are used to interfere with the very purposes to which schools are dedicated. If you wish to distribute materials on school property, approval must be obtained from the principal. Such principal has the authority to designate the time, place, and manner for such distribution.\n\nSubstitute Teachers\n\nDue to illness, professional obligation, personal business or other emergencies, it is sometimes necessary that the school employ a substitute teacher for the regular classroom teacher. Students are expected to be courteous and especially helpful to the substitute, who has all the responsibilities of the regular teacher. Let’s make the image of our school a good one in the eyes of the substitute teacher.\n\nSchool Meal Assistance\n\nFinancial assistance is available to parents who complete a Household Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals form and qualify for assistance. The forms are available during registration, online or at the administration building. The form completed must be for the current school year.\n\nA child is eligible if the total household income and the amount and source of income received by each household member fall within federal guidelines for Free/Reduced Meals.\n\nVolunteers\n\nVolunteers are welcomed in our school. Those volunteers who work directly with students or supervise a group of students on a field trip must complete the Safe Visitor process. Please see the section on School Visitors in this handbook.\n\nThe AP Capstone Diploma, conferred by The College Board, is an innovative and prestigious diploma program that gives students an opportunity to apply critical thinking, collaborative problem solving, and research skills in a cross-curricular context.\n\nStudents who are motivated and prepared for college-level coursework are best suited for the program, but the program benefits those students who show potential for AP coursework but have not yet enrolled in AP courses. Students should demonstrate curiosity about real world issues, a willingness to take intellectual risks, and a dedication to acquiring the skills that colleges and universities value – critical inquiry, analysis, and research. In short, AP Capstone students have an interest in becoming curious, independent, and collaborative scholars.\n\nBasic Requirements for AP Capstone Diploma\n\nAll students interested in pursuing the AP Capstone Diploma at WHS are required to select AP English Language and Composition as their grade 11 English course. AP Seminar will be embedded into this course to fulfill the required sequence. Students will also select AP Research in 12th grade, which will count as their senior English requirement.\n\nCore 40 Diploma\n\nCore 40 is the minimum diploma a student must earn to be considered for admission to a four year college in Indiana. Students may earn the Core 40 by earning 42 credits and completing the following requirements:\n\nCore 40 with Academic Honors Diploma\n\nThe Core 40 with Academic Honors Diploma (AHD) is a rigorous diploma that a student may earn by meeting specific criteria established by the Indiana State Board of Education.

Everett Light/Ivy Tech-Noblesville\n\nStudents who complete a program at JEL or Ivy Tech, register for and receive 6 credits of the related dual college credit through JEL or Ivy Tech, and earn a pathway designated industry-based certification meeting the THD requirements.\n\nGeneral Diploma\n\nTo graduate with less than a Core 40 diploma, the following formal opt-out process must be completed:\n\nThe student, the student’s parent/guardian, and the student’s counselor meet to discuss the student’s progress.\n\nThe student’s career and course plan is reviewed.\n\nThe student’s parent/guardian determines whether the student will achieve greater educational benefits by completing the general curriculum or the Core 40 curriculum.\n\nIf the decision is made to opt-out of Core 40, the student is required to complete the course and credit requirements for a general diploma and the career/academic sequence the student will pursue is determined. Students may earn the General Diploma by earning 42 credits and completing the following requirements (see next page):\n\nCredits from Other Institutions\n\nWestfield High School permits students to transfer earned credits from an accredited institution for the purpose of making up for failed classes. Westfield High School must give prior approval before students register for these classes.\n\nEarly Graduation\n\nSenior students with a sufficient number of credits in the appropriate subject areas are potentially eligible to graduate from Westfield High School following the successful completion of ten high school trimesters. (Adjustments may be made for transfer students.) However, students who wish to do so must apply through the Counseling Center. In the application the student must be able to show a good reason (such as work or continuing education) for the early graduation and also have the written consent of his or her parent(s) or guardian(s). Those who qualify may still participate in graduation ceremonies with their class.\n\nJunior students who wish to graduate after grade 11, must submit a written request to the high school principal if they wish to participate in graduation ceremonies of that same year. Graduation participation is an option only for those students who have completed all graduation requirements prior to graduation ceremonies. Students who complete graduation requirements after junior year, but prior to senior year, may participate in graduation ceremonies with their original cohort.\n\nSAT - State Graduation Exam\n\nBeginning in the spring of 2022, students in grade 11 will be required to take the SAT as part of the Indiana state graduation exam and federal accountability mandates. Details on passing scores, remediation requirements, and waiver options will be available as they are released by the Indiana Department of Education.\n\nCivics/Citizenship Test: Naturalization Examination (IC 20-30-5-7(d))\n\nEach student enrolled in a U.S. Government course where credit is awarded for General, Core 40, Core 40 with Academic Honors, or Core 40 with Technical Honors designation is required to take the naturalization examination provided by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as administered by the student’s high school. U.S. Government courses include Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, dual credit, and Cambridge International courses. Students do not need to pass the naturalization examination in order to pass the U.S.Government course. Retests are not required or published in the results.The total number of students, student scores, and student passing rates are collected at the school level for each semester or trimester the course is offered.\n\nSchools are required to report the following each semester or trimester during which students are enrolled in the U.S. Government course. (1) The number of students who took the naturalization examination, (2) The number of students who passed the naturalization examination by a score of not less than sixty percent (60%) on their first attempt, and (3) The pass rate of the naturalization examination regarding the students who participated. The school must also post results from the naturalization examination to the school’s website.\n\nScheduling Classes\n\nStudents select courses for each school year during the winter of the previous school year. The School Counseling Center provides scheduling materials and information to each student to assist with class selections. Much time is dedicated to developing a schedule to meet the needs of the student in working toward college preparedness, career goals, and high school graduation. Students will register for classes online. Schedule changes must be made by the posted deadline. Students are responsible for knowing and meeting graduation requirements.\n\nWestfield High School Schedule Change Policy\n\nStudents should submit all Schedule Change Request forms by the posted schedule change deadline. After the schedule change deadline, a student may only change their schedule under specific circumstances. Students wishing to change their schedule based on the allowances listed below are strongly encouraged to do so before the start of the trimester in which they wish to make the change. Courses started more than five days after the trimester begins may not be taken for credit.\n\nA counselor may adjust a student’s schedule, after the Schedule Change Deadline, for the following reasons:\n\nThe student must retake a failed class in order to meet graduation requirements.\n\nThe student no longer meets the prerequisite for a class.\n\nA student wishes to drop an elective course to take an academic course in one of the five core areas: English, math, science, social studies and world language; or a student is moving from a regular academic or elective class into an honors, AP or dual credit class.\n\nA student wishes to drop an elective to take another elective course. Academic classes in the five core areas may not be dropped to take an elective course.\n\nA senior wishes to take a course that would pertain to his or her chosen college major or commitment.\n\nIn cooperation with the state of Indiana’s career and technical education initiatives, a senior may choose to replace an elective course with an Independent Co-op, Cadet Teaching, Career Exploration Internship or Service Leadership course.\n\nA senior chooses to add a course to replace a Senior Seminar. Seniors are not allowed to drop classes for a Senior Seminar release period after the schedule change deadline.\n\nStudents may not drop a course in-progress due to poor grades or attendance. Once a trimester has begun, the only changes which will be made will be based on the following:\n\nA teacher has recommended a student’s level in a particular class be moved up or down based on the student’s academic performance. For example, a student may be moved from regular English to Honors English based on a teacher recommendation.\n\nMedical reasoning with documentation explaining why the student cannot continue in the course. In this case, the counselor, student and parent will determine the best placement for the student for the remainder of the trimester.\n\nRepeating a Class\n\nStudents must repeat required classes in which a failing grade was earned.\n\nRetaking a Course to Replace a Grade\n\nStudents who wish to retake a course in order to improve the grade may do so in consultation with their counselor and parent permission. A student may retake a course for a higher grade no more than four times during the duration of their high school career. Students will only be allowed to retake a course to replace a grade when a D or F is the original grade earned. When retaking a course, the old grade will be replaced with an “R”. Both the “R” and the new grade earned will appear on the student’s transcript. The higher grade will be associated with the credit and factored into the student’s GPA. The “R” will not be associated with credit and will not be factored into the student’s GPA. Students who wish to retake a course when the original grade is a C- or higher, may do so, but both the original grade and the new grade will be averaged as a half credit each, and both will be factored into the student’s GPA. Courses that are retaken must be done in a Westfield High School classroom, Indiana Online, or other approved and accredited institution. Gradpoint will not be approved for retaking courses to improve a grade or GPA.\n\neLearning\n\neLearning days are held in place of cancellation days which would need to be made up later, often in June, by adding days onto the end of the school calendar. When these make-up days are at the end of the school year they do not reflect the learning that was needed at the time of the day off. WWS eLearning days allow students to continue to make educational progress. This is especially important when faced with high stakes tests (ILEARN, AP, IREAD-3, etc.) which have fixed testing dates regardless of the number of cancellation days.\n\nSchool cancellation days will be eLearning Days unless otherwise communicated.\n\nAll classroom work will be posted by 10:00 AM on the day of the cancellation. K-4 students will find their work posted on Google Classroom and have a designated window to complete the work. 5-12 students will find their work on Canvas and have two school days to complete. For those students who do not have device or internet access, school lab hours will be posted. In addition, WWS partners with local businesses to provide students the opportunity to use WiFi during operating hours of the business.\n\nTeachers will have set office hours to provide students with instruction and technical support that will be communicated to students and parents. A tech hotline is also available to support students and parents as issues arise.\n\nAttendance will be determined by students logging in and engaging in their classwork over the duration of the eLearning period.\n\nLists of Frequently Asked Questions, staff office hours, Westfield WiFi Partners, and other information can be found on each school's website under the Parents tab.\n\nThe above protocols are for eLearning days due to inclement weather or other short-term or emergency situations. Should we need to move to eLearning for an extended period of time, such as the situation with COVID-19, guidance specific to the situation will be communicated.\n\nHigh Ability\n\nWestfield’s high ability services fall under a range of K-12 services in the RtI (Response to Instruction) process. Official identification occurs in late spring for grades K, 2, and 6, with additional qualifications in 8th grade for specific high ability courses at Westfield High School. Early services include flexible grouping, differentiation, and enrichment within the classroom and grade level. Middle and upper services include acceleration and honors/AP/ACP courses. Students may qualify in language arts and/or math. For more information, contact your child’s principal or the Assistant Superintendent - Curriculum & Instruction at, 317-867-8009.\n\nParent/Guardian Teacher Conferences\n\nWestfield High School may offer parent/guardian teacher conferences at the request of the parent/guardian or teacher. Parents/Guardians are encouraged to call the office and make an appointment to meet with teachers or the principal whenever they feel there is a need. Parents/Guardians are also invited to participate in a phone conference when time will not permit a personal visit. Each staff member has voicemail and an email address to make contact convenient for parents/guardians. Once school begins, a list of these numbers is made available to parents/guardians.\n\nRelease of Directory and Student Records/Privacy Act Information (Policy 10000-02)\n\nAs referenced in Policy 10000-02 and in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), sensitive information about students is kept confidential. FERPA defines \"directory information\" as information contained in the education records of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Typically, \"directory information\" includes information such as student’s name, address, parents’/guardians’ names, major field of study, sex, age, date of birth, grade level and school, school or activity photo, honors and awards, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, height and weight of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, and enrollment status. The law specifies, however, that certain non-sensitive “Directory Information” may be released for any purpose at the discretion of the school corporation, with general notification of such intent. Notification may consist of published policies such as this one.\n\nThe permission has been divided into two categories: Print and Electronic. Print publications such as the yearbook or student newspaper, printed programs for extracurricular activities, news releases to the local media, district publications, and interviews with local news media. Electronic mediums (internet and broadcast) such as district website, district videos, podcasts, and interviews with local news media for broadcast such as TV or radio.\n\nYou have the right to request the withholding of any or all directory information. Please consider very carefully your decision to withhold any of the above information. This information is typically used in news stories about our students’ achievements and classroom activities, honor roll lists, the yearbook, and school directories and school/district newsletters. Should you deny permission for the release of information, any future requests for such information from news media and other individuals will be refused for the duration of the school year.\n\nTo request withholding of information, please notify your child’s school in writing within 14 days of the start of school or within 14 days of enrolling your students.\n\nDuring a student’s career, the school system collects and records data concerning the student. The school system recognizes that the collection, maintenance, and limited dissemination of such data is essential in school operations, but also that preserving the rights of privacy of the student and parents/guardians, and the student’s or parent’s/guardian’s right to correct inaccurate data is equally essential.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-7-3 (Senate Bill 204, 2001), a school corporation or other entity to which the education records privacy provisions of the federal Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g) apply may disclose or report on the education records of a child, including personally identifiable information contained in the education records, without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian, under the following conditions:\n\nThe disclosure or reporting of education records is to a state or local juvenile justice agency.\n\nThe disclosure or reporting relates to the ability of the juvenile justice system to serve, before adjudication, the student whose records are being released.\n\nThe juvenile justice agency receiving the information certifies, in writing, to the entity providing the information that the agency or individual receiving the information has agreed not to disclose it to a third party, other than another juvenile justice agency, without the consent of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian.\n\nFor purposes of subsection two (2), a disclosure or reporting of education records concerning a child who has been adjudicated as a delinquent child shall be treated as related to the ability of the juvenile justice system to serve the child before adjudication if the juvenile justice agency seeking the information provides sufficient information to enable the keeper of the education records to determine that the juvenile justice agency seeks the information in order to identify and intervene with the child as a juvenile at risk of delinquency rather than to obtain information solely related to supervision of the child as an adjudicated delinquent child.\n\nAs referenced in Policy 10000-02 and in The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), personally identifiable information about students is kept confidential. Parents and eligible students (a student who has reached 18 years of age) have the right to:\n\ninspect and review the student’s education records at reasonable times within 45 days of the day a school receives a request to access records;\n\nseek amendment of the student’s education records believed to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights;\n\nprovide written consent before the school discloses the student’s education records, except to the extent FERPA authorizes disclosures without consent; and\n\nfile a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, Family Policy Compliance Office, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington D.C. 20202, concerning alleged failures by the district to comply with the requirements of FERPA.\n\nCertain persons may examine student records without a parent’s consent. These include school officials, who have “legitimate educational interests.” A school official is a person employed by the school as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel) or a person serving on the school board. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the school who performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of personally identifiable information from education records, such as a software or technology service provider, an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist; or a parent, student, or other volunteer assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\n\nA parent or eligible student may view his/her student’s records by making a request in writing to the building principal. Any request for amendment of education records by requesting an informal conference with the Superintendent or designee.\n\nRelease of Student Information to Military Recruiters\n\nIndiana schools are required to provide directory information to military recruiters who request it for purposes of informing students about educational and career opportunities. However, parents/guardians have the right to request in writing that they do not want this information released to recruiters.\n\nTo request that the school withhold directory information from military recruiters, a parent or legal guardian must submit a signed, written request to the high school counseling center by the end of the student’s sophomore year. Your letter will be kept on file for the duration of your child’s attendance at Westfield High School, and directory information will not be supplied to military recruiters. In making a decision to withhold information from recruiters, please keep in mind that the United States armed services, as well as the Indiana Air National Guard and Indiana Army National Guard, provide many excellent educational and career opportunities that may be of interest to your child by the time he or she is a senior.\n\nSpecial Education Services\n\nWWS accommodates the unique needs of students in special education ages 3-22 years of age in the students least restrictive environment, which means inclusion in general education classrooms as frequently as possible (case conference committee determination). Teachers use a common framework for education, but regularly—and creatively—adapt their instruction to accommodate the needs of the individual student. WWS is a single district planning corporation as it relates to special education services.\n\nDevelopmental Preschool Program (Child Find/Evaluation and Eligibility for special services): This program is for children ages 3-5 who qualify for special education services and is at Maple Glen Elementary School, Oak Trace Elementary School, Shamrock Springs Elementary School and Washington Woods Elementary School. Each student who qualifies is evaluated by our Early Childhood Assessment Tea (Child Find-Washington Woods Elementary School).\n\nWestfield Washington Schools also offers Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech and Language Therapy to students that qualify under an area of eligibility listed within Indiana Article 7.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools prepares all students for the day after graduation and emphasizes Life Readiness in order for all young people to be successful in our community. The student learning experience is shaped through cognitive and non-cognitive growth cultivated by opportunities provided by staff members on a daily basis at school. These opportunities will only be maximized through daily attendance. A student’s attendance is essential to learning -- learning that includes not only factual subject matter but also the skills needed for Life Readiness. Reading the material and performing satisfactorily on tests does not compensate for the loss of insight gained during guided instruction, class collaboration, or supervised work. Furthermore, every student contributes to one another; therefore, a student who is absent short-changes those who are not.\n\nWestfield Washington Schools bases its attendance policy on state code and Indiana Department of Education guidance. Indiana State Code requires children to attend school during the time it is in session until the child graduates or becomes 18 years of age. The Board of School Trustees, as an agency of the State, is required to enforce regular attendance of students. Absence from school is defined as any non-presence (excused or unexcused) during part or all of a scheduled school day that is not canceled or altered due to weather or other emergency.\n\nUsing both state code and IDOE guidance, Westfield Washington Schools establishes that all students must be in attendance for over 166 days of the 175 day school year, meaning that students should not miss more than 9 days in a year. The state of Indiana counts all absences alike, whether excused or unexcused. Not missing more than 9 days (whether excused or unexcused) ensures a student has an attendance percentage of 95% or higher; this percentage has been proven to maximize student learning. Westfield Washington Schools sees student attendance as the first and most important rule in creating the best learning experience for students.\n\nAny student who is absent for 10 full days or more, or for 10 individual class periods or more at the middle and high school level, puts their status as a student in good standing in jeopardy. As a result, the ability to participate in co-curricular or extracurricular events (including but not limited to clubs, athletics, performing arts, prom, et al.) may be revoked unless approved by an administrator.\n\nReporting Absences\n\nIt is the responsibility of the child’s parent to notify the school office when a student is absent. Please phone the attendance line at 317-867-6801 by 10:00 a.m. the day of the student’s absence. A parent may call the attendance line and leave a voicemail 24 hours a day. A parent may call in his/her native language. Please give your name, phone number, your child’s name, and the reason for the absence. Any absences not verified by a parent within 48 hours may be deemed as truant, which will compromise the ability of the students to make up work for credit.\n\nParents/Guardians are encouraged to provide a doctor’s excuse to the office for each absence that requires a visit to the doctor or other medical professional.\n\nPer state code, attendance policies are determined locally. It is a local decision to excuse or not excuse an absence.\n\nTypes of Absences\n\nIndiana State Code utilizes the terminology of Excused, Unexcused, and Truant for absences. As a result, Westfield Washington Schools utilizes the same terminology. Further explanation of these terms follows. Excused absences are verified by either a parent or a third party, such as a doctor and matching the board approved definition. Unexcused absences are unverified, or exceeding the allowed limit even if verified, or truancies.\n\nExcused Absences\n\nA parent call-in is required to excuse an absence\n\nStudent illness (with accompanying medical note preferred; accompanying med note is required if a student reaches 7 or more of any type of absences)\n\nDeath/grave illness of an immediate family member\n\nExclusion because of exposure to contagious disease\n\nRequired religious observation\n\nMedical, dental, or professional appointments. Please make every effort to schedule appointments outside of school hours.\n\nPre-arranged absences\n\nPre-arranged absences include vacations (not exceeding 7 days), club sports athletic tournaments, external performing arts opportunities, extended medical absences, job interviews and internship interviews. Any possible external verification for these types of absences is encouraged.\n\nParents/guardians are expected to plan vacations/college visits around the school schedule as absences are a serious interruption to the learning process.\n\nThe parent/guardian must call the school attendance office at least two school days in advance of any pre-arranged absence.\n\nPlanned vacation days shall be taken with the parent/guardian of the student.\n\nClass work shall be completed in advance of the pre-arranged absence or as teachers may determine.\n\nThe principal or assistant principal shall deny pre-arranged absence days to students having excessive absences or when vacation days will extend absences beyond the 7 day limit.\n\nOther Educational Activity\n\nOther educational activity is defined as any other absence, approved by the building principal or assistant principal, resulting from an educational activity that is relevant to the child’s academic growth and equivalent to the child’s school activities/experiences. Such absence requires prior notification by at least two school days prior to the absence and proper verification. These types of absences will be coded uniquely, accounting for presence in class on those days and not accumulating towards the student’s absence total. The principal or assistant principal shall have discretion to rescind prior approval of the other educational activity status if the reporting is deemed insufficient, if the student already has excessive absences, or if the student is not in good academic standing.\n\nIn accordance with IC 20-33-2-14, -15, -16, -17, students supplying the proper notification to the school office and participating in the following events are not counted absent:\n\nService as page or honoree of general assembly\n\nService to the election board or political candidate on Election Day.\n\nWitness in judicial proceeding or any required court appearance for which a student is subpoenaed.\n\nDuty with the Indiana National Guard (maximum 10 days)\n\nDuty with the Indiana wing of civil air patrol\n\nNational Guard duty (maximum 10 days).\n\nParticipation in the state fair\n\nA principal approved educationally sound activity.\n\nParents/Guardians must notify the school with physician documentation when circumstances of prolonged student illness occur. This will assist the principal in employing this policy’s parent/guardian notice and intervention provisions.\n\nUnexcused Absences\n\nAn unexcused absence is any absence not covered under either the definition of excused absence or listed as an exception to compulsory attendance.\n\nThe following are considered unexcused absences:\n\nAny absence in excess of 10 previously accrued that is not excused by state law or accompanied with medical verification, or previously approved by principal.\n\nAny absence not recognized by state law or Westfield Washington Schools.\n\nStudents arriving to class 30 minutes late or more are considered absent for that class. This will be considered unexcused unless accompanied with the proper verification noted above.\n\nTruant\n\nTruancy is defined as an absence from school without the knowledge or consent of the parent/guardian and the school, or absent from school when there is an attempt to evade the Indiana Compulsory Attendance Law. The following circumstances are considered truancy:\n\nThe willful non-attendance by a student not to attend school. This act of non-compliance is not authorized an/or known by the parent/guardian\n\nA student does not report for an assigned class during the course of the school day.\n\nA student leaving the building and/or school grounds during the day without permission.\n\nA student misrepresents a pass and does not report to a designated location during the day. An example would be reporting 20 plus minutes late for a class or wandering in the school to a designated location.\n\nLate arrival to school may be considered an instance of truancy.\n\nStudents will be considered a “habitual truant if they are truant from school more than ten (10) days in the school year.\n\nCodes to Know and Other Key Definitions\n\nKey Definitions:\n\nFull Day Presence: A student who attends three periods or more is considered present for the entire school day at Westfield High School (Single period absences may still be enforced with school discipline). It is the school’s goal to maximize full day presence.\n\nHalf Day Presence: A student who attends two periods in a school day is considered present for 50% of the day at Westfield High School. If a student must miss school, it is valuable that they still attend as much as possible on such a day.\n\nAbsence: A student who attends zero or only one period in a school day is considered absent for the day at Westfield High School.\n\nHabitual Truant: Habitual truant\" refers to a student who has been absent ten (10) days or more from school within a school year without being excused or without being absent under a parental request that has been filed with the school. (Indiana Code 20-18-2-6.5)\n\nChronic Absentee: The term Chronic Absentee refers to a student who has been absent 10% or more of the school days during the scholastic year (Indiana Department of Education)\n\nWestfield Washington Schools Truancy Prevention Policy\n\nEffective July 1, 2024, Indiana Code 20-33-2.5 establishes that each school corporation shall adopt a truancy prevention policy. Westfield Washington Schools champions student learning and preparation for Life after Graduation; as a result, every school will fulfill this plan as appropriate for grade level. Beyond state expectations, Westfield Washington Schools is committed to an informative and educational policy regarding student attendance. As a result, we incorporate three tiers to our system in order to best reach all families.\n\nTier 1: Every school will send all families returning to a district school a written attendance update at the end of each school’s term (trimester or quarter). These will be sent to emails on file. Transparency will be on display, with regular schoolwide data updates about attendance performance targets in principal newsletters.\n\nTier 2: Students who have missed five total days or more during the school term will be informed in writing. As this is cumulative throughout the year and not within one single grading period, this may not require further action unless otherwise indicated.\n\nTier 3:\n\nWestfield Washington Schools will initiate truancy prevention for any absent student who is absent 5 days (unexcused and/or unverified) within a trimester or quarter, depending on school. Westfield Washington Schools may also initiate truancy prevention for a student who has had 7 or more called-in absences, even if they are considered excused.\n\nStudents who are absent in conformity with a medical letter of incapacity to attend signed by a doctor, therapist, or other medical professional may be exempt from this.\n\nUpon the fifth unexcused absence, the process will be initiated with a written notification sent either virtually or on paper to the parents of the student, informing the parent of the student’s attendance record and reminding the parent of responsibility to monitor the student’s attendance and ensure the student attends school in accordance with compulsory attendance laws. This letter will invite response for a required in-person attendance conference to discuss an action plan of improvement. This letter will also include verbiage on the definition and action steps that must legally be taken if the student is considered a habitual truant, which includes reporting the student to an intake officer of the juvenile court or the department of child services in accordance with IC 20-33-2-25, and subsequent actions that may be taken by those entities upon referral by the school district.\n\nThe attendance conference will be held within five (5) school days of notification. The following individuals will be present in the conference:\n\nA representative of the school (principal, assistant principal, dean, and/or counselor)\n\nA teacher of the student (Grades K-6 only)\n\nThe student’s parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\nThe school will permit the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s) to elect to bring a representative who may provide insight into the student’s absenteeism if the student’s parent fulfills the following:\n\nMakes request to the school that the representative attend; and\n\nProvides notice tt the school regarding the identification of the representative;\n\nat least forty-eight (48) hours before the attendance conference.\n\nDuring the meeting, an attendance contract will be developed; contract will be in effect for forty-five (45) days. Attendance contract may include expectations accompanied with extra supports and/or accountability measures.\n\nAt the secondary level, this may take place for students who have accrued five unexcused absences to a single class period.\n\nMake-Up Work\n\nClasswork and assignments are essential to the learning process. All work missed due to absence (excused, unexcused, or truancy) is expected to be completed. A student shall have one day to make up work for each day of absence. This guideline may be altered at the discretion of the principal and the teacher if it is determined that it is unreasonable for the student to complete all missing work within the allotted time. This guideline may also be altered for unexcused prearranged absences, such as vacations, in order for the learning process to remain as uninterrupted as possible. Students should utilize Canvas first to see the work they missed while they are out, completing what is possible to be completed if physically able. Lengthy absences may require that the teacher provide schoolwork alternatives and timeframes for completion. In such cases, the teacher will notify the student and the principal. Teachers will strive to ensure the alternative assignments assist the student in achieving course learning targets and set a reasonable timeframe for the completion of the work.\n\nCurricular, Co-Curricular and Extracurricular Incentives for Attending\n\nStudents in regular attendance are considered students in good standing. A student must attend three class periods on the day of a co-curricular or extracurricular activity on the day of the activity in order to be able to participate. If the event takes place on Saturday, the student must fulfill this obligation on Friday. Administrative approval is required for any exceptions.These events include but are not limited to athletic contests, musical and theatrical performances, academic team competitions, prom, et al.\n\nA student who has accrued five or more absences in any given trimester or ten or more absences for the current school year (excused or unexcused) may be withheld by administration from participating in field trips.\n\nA student who has accrued five or more absences in any given trimester or ten or more absences for the current year may be withheld from participation in school organizations, including but not limited to athletic teams, musical and theatrical co-/extracurricular organizations, et al.\n\nA student must have a 95% career attendance rate (no more than nine absences per year) as one factor in order to be considered for senior College Prep Release period.\n\nTardies are considered a form of absence. A student who has accrued excessive tardies may be withheld from participating in field trips as well as co-/extracurricular activities and organizations.\n\nDisciplinary Action\n\nWestfield Washington Schools may utilize school discipline for any unexcused absence, truancy, or absence exceeding 7 in the school year unless deemed excused by administration.\n\nA. Disciplinary Action for Truancy\n\nThe result of the first truancy/unexcused absence will be:\n\nDetentions twice the number of hours missed, or\n\nSaturday School if a total of four hours of detention is to be served.\n\nThe result of a second truancy will be:\n\nSaturday School\n\nSubsequent truancies/unexcused absences will result in one or more of the following:\n\nLoss of ability to participate in co-curricular and/or extracurricular activities/organizations; loss of ability to participate in field trips.\n\nLoss of driving privileges for students who are drivers\n\nReferral to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of invalidation of driver’s license\n\nPlacement on an attendance contract\n\nReferral to Hamilton County ACES\n\nReferral to DCS\n\nFiling of truancy with the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office\n\nSuspension and/or expulsion\n\nB. Actions for Absences Exceeding 10 in the School Year\n\nExcessive absences can merit both school discipline as well as extra support. Any of the following disciplinary steps may occur:\n\nLoss of ability to participate in co-curricular and/or extracurricular activities/organizations; loss of ability to participate in field trips.\n\nAfter-school detention to make up missed time\n\nSaturday School for more built in study time\n\nAttendance Contract\n\nRequirement for parent/guardian to produce a certificate of incapacity not later than six (6) days after the certificate is demanded.\n\nLoss of driving privileges for students who are drivers\n\nReferral to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of invalidation of driver’s license\n\nRequirement for medical notes upon future absences.\n\nWellness check through WPD\n\nReferral to DCS\n\nReferral to Hamilton County ACES\n\nFiling of truancy with the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s office.\n\nSuspension and/or expulsion\n\nWestfield Washington Schools Attendance Procedures/Hamilton County Schools Attendance Program Project ACES – Attending Class Equals Success\n\nWestfield Washington Schools participates in the Hamilton County Schools Project ACES Attendance Program in collaboration with the Hamilton County Juvenile Prosecutor’s Office. Project ACES tracks the total number of excused/unexcused absences to school accumulated for the entire school year. The goal of Project ACES is to ensure that every child attends school as required by Indiana Law so that each child will receive the necessary guidance and knowledge to become a productive member of the community. Absences to school are cumulative throughout the school year and do not reset at any point during the school year for grades K-12.\n\nProject ACES is a collaboration between the school, parent, student, Westfield Youth Assistance Program, and the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office. In working together and through early intervention, we believe that attending class will equal success for each and every student.\n\nLegal Loss of Driving Privileges\n\nWHS will notify the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which could then either invalidate that student’s license to operate a motor vehicle or prevent the student from acquiring a learner’s permit for a time period as prescribed by law.\n\nThe Bureau of Motor Vehicles is prohibited from issuing a driver’s license or permit to a student less than eighteen (18) who:\n\nis a habitual truant;\n\nhas at least a second suspension from school for the school year;\n\nhas an expulsion from school; or\n\nhas withdrawn from school, for a reason other than financial hardship, and the withdrawal was reported before graduating.\n\nIf a person is less than eighteen (18) years of age and is a habitual truant, is under a suspension or an expulsion, or has withdrawn from school as described in Section 1 of this chapter, the bureau shall, upon notification by the person’s principal, invalidate the person’s license or permit until the earliest of the following events.\n\nA student whose license or permit has been denied or invalidated for the above reasons will be eligible for a license or permit or have a license or permit revalidated upon the earliest of one of the following events:\n\nthe student turns eighteen (18);\n\n120 days after the person is suspended, or the end of a trimester during which the person returns to school, whichever is longer;\n\nthe suspension, expulsion, or exclusion is reversed after the person has had a hearing under IC 20-33-8.\n\nFurthermore, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles may not issue a driver’s license or permit to a student who is:\n\nat least thirteen (13) years of age, but less than fifteen (15);\n\na habitual truant;\n\nand identified in a list submitted to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles may not be issued an operator’s license or a learner’s permit to drive a motor vehicle or motorcycle under IC 9-24 until the person is at least eighteen (18) years of age.\n\nSuspensions and Expulsions\n\nOccasionally, a student may be removed from school for a short or long period of time. Such removals are considered to be suspensions or expulsions.\n\nSuspensions: The principal or his designee may remove a student from a class for up to five (5) days or from school for up to ten (10) days.\n\nExpulsions: The principal or their designee may suspend a student from school for ten (10) days and request expulsion for up to one calendar year. If an expulsion hearing is scheduled, an independent hearing officer will be appointed to hear the infraction.\n\nWithdraw/Fail from Classes\n\nAny student withdrawn from classes due to attendance or discipline reasons will not be considered a student in good standing and will forfeit their privileges at Westfield High School until they re-enroll. This includes, but is not limited to, dances, extra-curricular events, driving to school, and may include graduation. Even without being withdrawn from a class, a senior with excessive absences may be placed on a “contract to walk,” which may impact his/her ability to participate in extracurricular events as well as commencement ceremonies.\n\nTest Make-Up Procedure\n\nIt is the policy of Westfield High School that a student should not miss classroom instruction to take make-up tests and quizzes. In order to implement this policy, the following guidelines are established:\n\nMake-up sessions will be offered during our CORE Time and also before or after the instructional day at times communicated by the Testing Center staff.\n\nAll tests and quizzes missed must be taken the following week during the make-up sessions in the Testing Center. Any exceptions to the rule must be approved by an administrator.\n\nAttendance for Final Exams\n\nFinal exams are considered an important part of each course. Final exams represent up to 15% of the final grade. Requests to the school to give students final tests early for jobs, vacation, and other reasons are unfair when weighed against the priorities of students’ attendance at school and the important business of finishing the grading period. The school calendar is published early to help parents/guardians and students schedule around final test time.\n\nFinal exams are given at the time and on the date scheduled. Only the administration can excuse a student from a final exam for extenuating circumstances. WHS Administration will not approve any Other Educational Activities during final exam time.\n\nFinal Exam Make-up Policy\n\nAny final exams not taken on the assigned date must be made up in the testing center that following week. Final exams in the third trimester should be completed within three (3) weekdays from the last day of school. All tests not made up by that time will get a score of “0”.\n\nPlease refer to the school calendar prior to planning any activities that could cause a student to miss these tests.\n\nDrug/Alcohol Policy (C450)\n\nAs referenced in Policy C450, students who are in possession of drugs and/or paraphernalia and/or who have items that a reasonable person could judge to be used in the sale of drugs or paraphernalia or who exhibit behavior which lead school authorities to have reasonable suspicion to suspect the student is under the influence of a controlled substance will be subject to the drug/discipline policy and will be dealt with accordingly. Furthermore, the school may subject items in said student’s possession to a test to determine if those items contain drugs or alcohol. This may include a vehicle the student used to get to school.\n\nThe school administration may also require a drug/alcohol screen to be immediately administered at the school corporation’s expense. If the test is positive, all future drug tests will be done at the parent’s/guardian’s or student’s expense. Factors which the administration will consider may include, but are not limited to:\n\nOdor of alcohol/marijuana/smoke;\n\nGlassy, dilated, bloodshot eyes, or dark circles under eyes;\n\nAppears dazed, giddy;\n\nStaggering walk;\n\nSlurred or rapid speech;\n\nIncoherent thought processes;\n\nDisruptive, aggressive, physically threatening, out of control, or unusual behavior;\n\nBragging or talking to other students about alcohol or drug use;\n\nNoticeable withdrawal from favorite activities and friends;\n\nPhysical indicators from an objective assessment by the school nurse or;\n\nPossession of, use, or transporting drug paraphernalia or items used to weigh or sell drugs or drug paraphernalia.\n\nRefusal to submit to a drug test will be considered an admission of being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. This is a violation of school rules and will be dealt with according to the student discipline policy. The administration will make a reasonable attempt to apprise the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the situation.\n\nIn addition, in an effort to promote a drug-free campus and to protect the safety and health of the school’s faculty, staff and students, Westfield High School periodically requests the Westfield Police Department to conduct random searches of both the lockers and the school"
