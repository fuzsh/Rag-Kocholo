        "text": "Growth is slowing for some Hamilton County districts, but that doesn't mean redistricting is over, yet.\n\nWESTFIELD, Ind. — For decades it has largely been the same story in Hamilton County: booming population growth for Hamilton Southeastern and Carmel Clay Schools. Now the districts are preparing for something different — stabilization, as the most rapid growth moves to Westfield-Washington Schools.\n\nRecent demographic studies commissioned by the districts show Hamilton Southeastern and Carmel Clay's enrollment leveling out, then decreasing slightly over the next 10 years.\n\nThis doesn't mean the county is done growing. Last year it was the fastest-growing area in the state, gaining about 7,000 residents while more than half of Indiana's counties experienced population decline. And the city of Carmel is re-entering a building boom, ramping up projects to attract private investment.\n\nBut most of the county's school districts expect housing construction to slow and the overall population to age, as families who swarmed to the area become empty nesters.\n\nMore from Emma Kate Fittes:\n\nFishers is finally getting its new elementary\n\nWhy Carmel Schools says it needs a referendum\n\nIt could also mean less redistricting in the future, although some Hamilton County residents will experience changes in the next couple of years.\n\nStill shuffling\n\nCarmel Clay's student body is expected to shrink by 209 students, or 1.3 percent, by 2021, according to a demographic study. Then, in the following five years, enrollment will decline by 759 students, or 4.8 percent, the study shows.\n\nThe loss isn't a great concern to the district, said spokeswoman Courtnery Taylor. It's one of the reasons officials have no plans to build new schools or redistrict students, she said.\n\nHamilton Southeastern is similarly expecting a slight decline, with a demographic study predicting enrollment to drop by 552 students in 10 years. That's a loss of less than 1 percent of the student body each year.\n\nBut unlike Carmel, Hamilton Southeastern is starting construction on an elementary school to accommodate its current number of students and to cut down on use of portable classrooms. District spokeswoman Beverly Redmond said some K-8 students will be redistricted when the new building opens in fall 2019.\n\nIn Noblesville, the school board is hoping to avoid constructing a new building as their 10-year demographic study also predicted a slight decrease in enrollment. Two weeks ago, the board decided to no longer allow students to transfer to another school in the district. The board also approved redistricting of Stoney Creek, Promise Road and North elementaries next fall to avoid spending $20 million constructing another elementary, according to its website.\n\nUp and coming\n\nNow the booming growth in Hamilton County is in Westfield-Washington. School officials in Carmel and Hamilton Southeastern have compared it to the exponential growth they saw in the 1990s, although the smaller district would need to more than double to catch up.\n\nDuring the next 10 years, Westfield-Washington's student body is expected to grow by more than 1,300 students, with most of that growth happening within the next five years. Growth isn't new for Westfield. The district has grown by 1,070 students in the past five years, according to state data.\n\nAs a result, school officials are considering expanding Westfield Intermediate, Westfield Middle and Westfield High School. Advocates are pointing to the demographic study in asking residents to approve a referendum that would increase taxes to pay for construction just months after voters approved a referendum worth around $5.3 million annually for operational expenses.\n\nThe construction referendum would increase the tax rate by 30 cents per $100 assessed value and bring in $90 million for improvements and expansion over the next 20 years. Residents can vote in the May 2 special election."
