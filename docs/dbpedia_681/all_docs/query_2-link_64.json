        "text": "Westfield is a fantastic community that is continuing to experience growth and development. At Westfield Welcome, we're passionate about serving our neighbors and offering fun experiences for residents and visitors alike. This would not be possible without our network of dedicated volunteers!\n\n​\n\nWhether supporting our community events, assisting visitors at Grand Park, or caring for our parks and trails, there's a volunteer opportunity for anyone looking to get involved!\n\nOur Trail Ambassador Program partners the community with Westfield’s beautiful trails. Ambassadors can be individuals, families, groups, or organizations that are willing to maintain at least 1 mile of any trail for a 1 year period. Ambassadors are asked to focus on the three core values of the program: Beautification, Safety and Service.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a Trail Ambassador please reach out to our Hospitality Coordinator, Logan Charlesworth, atlcharlesworth@westfield.in.gov\n\n​\n\nBeautification:\n\nThrough the use of trash and/or recycle bags (self-supplied), sweep the trail or park assigned and recover any litter or natural debris that could pose a threat to safety. While park space is generally well-defined, trail space may vary greatly from section to section. Be sure to peer into wooded areas or along fence lines. Report plant concerns such as overgrown or invasive plant species. Keep an eye out for graffiti and other forms of vandalism. Gardening gloves are recommended.\n\n​\n\nSafety:\n\nScan the physical portions of the trails for any safety hazards that may exist. This includes broken trail, dangerous trees and suspicious activity. Physical dangers should be recorded and reported to (317) 804-3184 as soon as possible. Suspicious activity should immediately be avoided and reported to the police (do not take action!) by dialing 9-1-1.\n\n​\n\nService:\n\nWestfield is proud of its city and its partners. Wear your organization’s gear and spread the word about the great things of the city, or simply smile and say hello to fellow travelers. Assist someone crossing the street if needed, or go the extra mile for runners on a hot day and hand out bottles of water. If the chance comes to aid a fellow resident, take it. We want everyone to feel welcome and like family in Westfield. Sometimes all it takes is a wave and a smile, but we feel there is always a little more that can be done. For more information on going the extra-mile, please take the time to complete our Super Service Online Training."
