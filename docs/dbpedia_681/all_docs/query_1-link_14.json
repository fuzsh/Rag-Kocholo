From student led meetings to micro-economies to stewardship of their school environment, our Middle School students leave for High School with a deep understanding of social, economic, environmental and ethical leadership challenges they will inevitably face later on in their lives.\n\nThis program emphasizes inquiry based problem solving, applied scientific method, diversity and perspective while encouraging compassionate and respectful relationships and the responsible and ethical use of technology.\n\nAdmissions"
