We concentrate on learning/refining how to construct persuasive arguments and how to refute them; an emphasis is placed on having each student debate frequently. Debate topics span a wide range, including current events, philosophy and politics. Debaters are encouraged to develop an understanding of many disciplines such as economics, current events, history, geopolitics, philosophy and international affairs. Many interdisciplinary subjects will be discussed in class. We will prepare together for local and global debate competitions (although it is not mandatory to compete). Students of all levels are welcome to register. We find that students make great progress not only in the development of their public speaking and debate skills but also in their academic subjects as they grow as critical and analytical thinkers. Depending on the number of students and their levels, classes can be subdivided based on experience.\n\nClick here to register!\n\nTime:\n\nTuesdays, 8–9:30am Eastern Time\n\n(8–9:30pm China Standard Time)\n\n(5:30 – 7:00pm India Standard Time)\n\nTuesday Class Schedule:\n\nFall Term: 9/03/24 - 2/11/25\n\nSpring Term: 2/18/25 - 6/17/25\n\n(tuition is charged per term)\n\nInstructor: Ryan Lafferty\n\nClass Description: This class focuses on developing and improving debating, oral advocacy and public speaking skills.

The goals of this class are to help students feel comfortable with public speaking and to teach them the basics of debate. Students will learn the fundamentals of debate and public speaking from their instructor and from in-class debates in a supportive and respectful environment. Becoming comfortable with public speaking at an early age will help your children grow to become confident, well-spoken students and leaders. We have offered this class for years to our American students and find that children who start at this age are so prepared and excited to join their debate team when they become eligible. Ages 8-10."
