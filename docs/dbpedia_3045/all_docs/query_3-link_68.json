        "text": "This report documents the broad and complex historical landscape that extends across much of Virginia's Culpeper and Fauquier Counties, anchored along the Rappahannock River. During 1862-1864, nine battle engagements took place in this area, and its strategic importance during the Civil War is established by this report's in-depth analysis that includes a wealth of current resources as well as historic photos and maps. An excellent resource for anyone interested in learning more about the historical landscape of Culpeper and Fauquier Counties."
