Enjoy.]\n\nCAMP OF INSTRUCTION.\n\nThe regiment was mobilized at the Camp of Instruction at \"Crab Tree,\" about three (3) miles west of Raleigh, NC. At this Camp, during the months of July and August of 1861, were assembled ten (10) companies from the counties of Alamance, Anson, Ashe, Caldwell, Chatham, Moore, Randolph, Union, Wake, and Wilkes. These companies were organized before leaving home, and on arrival at Camp of Instruction, reported as follows:\n\nAJeff Davis Mountaineers, Ashe County; Capt. Andrew N. McMillan; 1st Lt. George R. Reeves; 2nd Lt. Jesse A. Reeves; Junior 2nd Lt. James Porter.\n\nBWaxhaw Jackson Guards, Union County; Capt. John J. C. Steele; 1st Lt. William Wilson; 2nd Lt. Thomas J. Cureton; Junior 2nd Lt. John W. Richardson.\n\nCWilkes Volunteers, Wilkes County; Capt. Abner B. Carmichael; 1st Lt. Alexander H. Horton; 2nd Lt. Phineas Horton; Junior 2nd Lt. William W. Hampton.\n\nDWake Guards, Wake County; Capt. Oscar R. Rand; 1st Lt. James B. Jordan; 2nd Lt. James T. Adams; Junior 2nd Lt. James W. Vinson.\n\nEChatham Independent Guards, Chatham County; Capt. William S. Webster; 1st Lt. William J. Headen; 2nd Lt. Bryant G. Dunlap; Junior 2nd Lt. Stephen W. Brewer.\n\nFHilbriten Guards, Caldwell County; Capt. Nathaniel P. Rankin; 1st Lt. Joseph R. Ballew; 2nd Lt. John B. Holloway; Junior 2nd Lt. Alfred T. Stewart.\n\nGChatham Boys, Chatham County; Capt. William S. McLean; 1st Lt. John E. Matthews; 2nd Lt. George C. Underwood; Junior 2nd Lt. Henry C. Albright.\n\nHMoore Independents, Moore County; Capt. William P. Martin; 1st Lt. Clement Dowd; 2nd Lt. James D. Mclver; Junior 2nd Lt. Robert W. Goldston.\n\nICaldwell Guards, Caldwell County; Capt. Wilson A. White; 1st Lt. John Catrou; 2nd Lt. John T. Jones; Junior 2nd Lt. Milton B. Blair.\n\nKPee Dee Wild Cats, Anson County; Capt. James C. Caraway; 1st Lt. James S. Kendall; 2nd Lt. John C. McLauchlin; Junior 2nd Lt. William W. Boggan.\n\nThe commandant of the Camp of Instruction at Crab Tree was Maj. Henry King Burgwyn, Jr., not twenty-one (21) years of age, who had graduated at the Virginia Military Institute in May previous. The Adjutant of the Camp was Oliver Cromwell Petway, also a cadet at the Virginia Military Academy in 1860-1861, subsequently Lieutenant Colonel of the 35th NC Regiment, and killed at Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862.\n\nOf this young commandant, Corporal John R. Lane, Company G, subsequently rising by his military talents to the Colonelcy of the regiment, gives his first impressions as follows: \"We took the train at Company Shops (now Burlington) for Raleigh; arriving at this place, the company marched out to Camp Crab Tree, a Camp of Instruction, and were assigned our position in camp a little after dark. On the next morning when we awoke, we saw the sentinels at their posts and realized that we were indeed in the war. Immediately after roll callbut there was no roll call in our companyMaj. H. K. Burgwyn, commander of the Camp of Instruction, sent down to Capt. William S. McLean, demanding the reason for his failure to report his company. Before the excitement occasioned by his message had subsided among the commissioned officers, an order came for a corporal and two men to report at once at headquarters. Capt. McLean selected Corporal Lane, his lowest subaltern officer, and two of the most soldierly-looking men, S. S. Carter and W. G. Carter, to report to Maj. Burgwyn.\n\nAccordingly, these three (3) worthies appeared before the commandant, wondering whether they were going to be promoted, hanged, or shot. This was our first sight of the commanding officer, who appeared though young, to be a youth of authority, beautiful and handsome; the flash of his eye and the quickness of his movements betokened his bravery. At first sight I both feared and admired him. He gave us the following order: \"Corporal, take these men and thoroughly police this Camp; don't leave a watermelon rind or anything filthy in Camp.\" This cheering order completely knocked the starch out of our shirts and helped greatly to settle us down to a soldier's life. The cleanliness of the camp was reported by the officer of the day as being perfect. You may be sure our officers reported the company promptly after that.\n\nREGIMENTAL ORGANIZATION (AUGUST 27, 1861).\n\nThe companies composing the regiment were from the central and western counties of the State; counties which had opposed secession until the Proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln (April 15, 1861) calling upon Governor John W. Ellis to furnish North Carolina's quota of seventy-five thousand (75,000) volunteers to coerce the seceding Southern States.\n\nAfter being drilled and otherwise disciplined, these ten (10) companies were organized into a regiment designated as the 26th NC Regiment (State Troops - Infantry). The company officers completed the regimental organization by electing as Colonel, Capt. Zebulon Baird Vance, then Captain of the \"Rough and Ready Guards\" from Buncombe County, in the 14th NC Regiment; as Lieutenant Colonel, Maj. Henry King Burgwyn, Jr., commandant of the camp; and as Major, Capt. Abner B. Carmichael of Company C.\n\nCol. Vance subsequently appointed 1st Lt. James B. Jordan, of Company D, as Adjutant; Sergeant Joseph J. Young, of Company D, as Quartermaster; 2nd Lt. Robert Goldston, of Company H, as Commissary, who died at Carolina City in October of 1861; Dr. Thomas J. Boykin, of Sampson County, as Surgeon; and Private Daniel W. Shaw, Company H, as Assistant Surgeon, who died on September 12, 1861, also at Carolina City. Rev. Robert H. Marsh, of Chatham County, since so widely known as an eloquent preacher of the Baptist persuasion, was appointed Chaplain. The commissions of the officers bore the date of August 27, 1861. 1st Lt. Alexander H. Horton, of Company C, was promoted Captain vice Abner B. Carmichael, who was elected Major. The non-commissioned staff were:\n\nLeonidas L. Polk, Sergeant Major, of Company K.\n\nBenjamin Hinds, Hospital Steward, of Company K.\n\nE. H. Hornaday, Ordnance Sergeant, of Company E.\n\nJesse T. Ferguson, Commissary Sergeant, of Company C.\n\nAbraham J. Lane, Quartermaster Sergeant, of Company G.\n\nENCAMPMENT ON BOGUE ISLAND.\n\nPromptly on its organization the regiment was ordered to the defense of Fort Macon, on Bogue Island. Leaving Raleigh on the 2nd of September, 1861, under command of Lt. Colonel Burgwyn, (Col. Vance not having as yet reported for duty), the regiment, halting a few days at Morehead City, took up its permanent camp near Fort Maconat which place Col. Vance assumed command. The months of September, October, and November of 1861, were passed at this place. The time was occupied in guard duties, drilling, and preparing for the arduous duties that lay before them.\n\nOccasionally, upon rumor that the enemy were landing, the long roll would be sounded, and the regiment drawn up in line. There was great sickness among the soldiers. An endemic of measles and fever prevailed. A hospital was established at Carolina City on the mainland, three miles west of Morehead CityCommissary Robert W. Goldston, Assistant Surgeon Daniel Shaw, 1st Lt. John E. Matthews and many privates died in a short while. Nine (9) men from one Company died in a week. Supplies had to be brought across the Sound, and the water being shallow, the men had to wade quite a distance to get to the vessels bringing the rations.\n\nThe regimental officers were incessant in their attentions to their men, showing them every kindness, providing every comfort possible, and became much endeared to those under their authority. When time came to go into winter quarters, the regiment was moved to the mainland and camped midway between Morehead City and Carolina City. While in this camp, Capt. William S. McLean, of Company G, was appointed Acting Assistant Surgeon, and Corporal John R. Lane was elected Captain of the Company.\n\nThe winter of 1861-1862 was passed in unremitting drill and under strict measures of discipline, which got the regiment into fine condition for the opening campaign; and here they acquired a reputation for efficiency in drill and obedience to orders which they retained with increasing credit until the final surrender.\n\nIn October of 1861, Brig. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC) was appointed to the command of the District of Pamlico, to be succeeded in November by Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch (NC). After the fall of Roanoke Island (February 8, 1862) and in view of the threatened attack on New Bern by Federal Brig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, the regiment was ordered up the railroad within three (3) miles of New Bern, and there went into bivouac and assigned to Brig. Gen. Branch's command, which as then constituted, was composed of the 7th, 26th, 27th, 33rd, 35th, and 37th NC Regiments, Infantry, and Latham's and Brem's Batteries of artillery, Col. Samuel B. Spruill's 2nd Cavalry (9th NC Volunteers), a battalion of militia under Col. H. J. B. Clark, and some detached companies. Brig. Gen. Richard C. Gatlin (NC), commanding the Department of North Carolina and coast defenses, headquarters at Goldsborough, was in supreme command.\n\nBATTLE OF NEW BERN, NC14 MARCH, 1862.\n\nFederal Brig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside flushed with his captures of Fort Hatteras (August 29, 1861) and Roanoke Island (February 8, 1862) was now about to attempt still greater movements on the military chess board, and on March 11, 1862, he embarked the brigades of Brig. Gen. John G. Foster, Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, and Brig. Gen. John G. Parke and accompanying artillery, at Roanoke Island and reached Slocum's Creek where it empties into the Neuse River, some sixteen (16) miles from New Bern, on the evening of March 12th. Early next morning, after shelling the country around, Brig. Gen. Burnside disembarked his command, and ordered Brig. Gen. Foster's Brigade to advance up the county road, and attack our front and left; Brig. Gen. Reno's Brigade to march up the railroad with orders to turn our right; and Brig. Gen. Parke's Brigade to follow along the county road at convenient distance as a support either to Brig. Gen. Foster or Brig. Gen. Reno as there might be need.\n\nPlat Created by Lt. Woodbury Wheeler, of Latham's Battery\n\nBrig. Gen. Burnside's advance appears to have met no opposition; the Croatan breastworks above Otter Creek he found abandoned, and at night his entire command bivouacked in easy striking distance of the Confederate lines of defense, which we will now describe. About five (5) miles below New Bern on the right bank of the Neuse River the Confederates had constructed a strong fort, called \"\"Fort Thompson,\" manned by thirteen (13) siege guns of good size, supported by ten (10) field pieces, with three (3) navy 32-pounders on its rear face. From the fort in a straight line to the railroad leading from New Bern to Morehead City, was the main line of defense, consisting of a strong breastwork about one and one-quarter miles in length.\n\nThrough the center of these breastworks the Beaufort County Road leading to New Bern passed, and intersected the railroad about two (2) miles behind the works; thence crossed the Trent River on a wooden bridge about a mile and a half above New Bern. Where the breastworks met the railroad there was a brick kiln, and this proved to be the cause of all our woes in this battle. Instead of continuing the breastworks straight across the railroad into the swamp beyond, to make the line as short as possible after reaching the railroad, the line was thrown back about 150 yards to the banks of Bullen's Creek and thence, a series of small breastworks conforming to the features of the ground, ran off in the direction of a swamp. To guard this gap of 150 yards in which was this brick kiln plant, Brig. Gen. Lawrence O. Branch (NC) ordered the brick kiln to be loopholed; and the evening before the battle, had ordered down two (2) 24-pounder guns which were being mounted when the party was fired into in the beginning of the action and the work was stopped never to be resumed. The timber in front of the breastworks had been felled for some 350 yards.\n\nBrig. Gen. Branch's disposition of his troops had to be made with great rapidity, as the enemy left him no time for delay. At 4 p. m. on the 12th of March, Brig. Gen. Branch was notified of the enemy's approach. He ordered Col. James Sinclair, of the 35th NC Regiment, to proceed to Fisher's Landing, just above the mouth of Otter Creek, to resist any attempt of the enemy to land. Late in the night he ordered the 26th NC Regiment and Brem's Battery, Lt. Colonel Henry K. Burgwyn in command, to follow, Col. Zebulon B. Vance being temporarily in command of the Post of New Bern. These troops arrived to find the enemy had anticipated them by occupying this ground, so the two (2) regiments fell back to take their places in the main line for the next day's battle.\n\nBrig. Gen. Branch divided his forces that were to defend the works on the left of the railroad, namely, between the railroad and Fort Thompson, into two (2) wings to be commanded respectively by Col. Charles C. Lee, of the 37th NC Regiment, and Col. Reuben P. Campbell, of the 7th NC Regiment. Col. Lee's command embraced the troops between the fort and the county road, and was composed of the 27th NC Regiment and his own, the 37th NC Regiment; on the right of the county road reaching to the railroad constituted Col. Campbell's command and was defended by his own regiment (the 7th); the 35th, and Capt. Whitehurst's independent company, and on the right next to the railroad was placed the battalion of militia under command of Col. H. J. B. Clark. Two (2) sections of Brem's and Latham's batteries of artillery were posted along this line between the county road and railroad, under Col. Campbell's command.\n\nCol. Vance, of the 26th NC Regiment, was in command of all the defenses on the right of the railroad, comprising a distance of one and a quarter miles. His own regiment, one or two (1-2) detached companies and a section of Brem's Artillery, were the only troops at his disposal for this important defense. His line ran along the bank of Bullen's Creek for about half a mile, until the creek emptied into a swamp; beyond this swamp his line was extended to the Weathersby Road leading to New Bern; and beyond this (on the right) was Bryce's Creek, a deep and impassable stream of about 75 yards wide, which empties into the Trent River. Shortly after the battle opened, the part of Col. Vance's line next to the railroad and under the immediate command of Maj. Abner B. Carmichael, of the 26th NC Regiment, was reinforced, first by five (5) companies of Col. Clark M. Avery's Regiment, the 33rd NC Regiment, held in reserve; and as the battle progressed and more determined became the attempt of the enemy to carry this position, the other five (5) companies of the 33rd NC Regiment, under the gallant Col. Avery and Lt. Colonel Robert F. Hoke, came to Maj. Carmichael's assistance. As will hereafter be seen, the enemy never succeeded in carrying the works on the right of the railroad.\n\nDuring the day of March 13th, the enemy kept up a brisk shelling from their gunboats, now in the Neuse, and keeping abreast of their land forces; and by night had gotten his three (3) brigades in position for the attack early the next morning. These were disposed as follows: Brig. Gen. John G. Foster formed his line across the county road parallel to the Confederate works, the 25th and 24th Massachusetts Regiments on the right, and the 27th and 23rd Massachusetts on the left, supported by six navy howitzers and the howitzers of Captains Dayton and Bennett.\n\nBrig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno formed his brigade on the left of the railroad in the following order, viz., the 21st Massachusetts, 9th New Jersey, and 51st Pennsylvania Regiments. Brig. Gen. John G. Parke's Brigade was drawn up in line in the intermediate space between Brig. Gen. Foster and Brig. Gen. Reno, with orders to support whichever brigade needed it.\n\nAbout 7:30 a.m. the battle was opened by a shot from a Parrott gun from Latham's battery under Lt. Woodbury Wheeler. This shot dispersed a squad of horsemen who seemed to be reconnoitering under cover of the woods. Immediately after this, the firing became general. Brig. Gen. Foster's attacks on the main works in his front made but little, if any, impression; they were easily repulsed. Doubtless the enemy knew the weak points in the Confederate line of defense. Immediately on getting his men into line, Brig. Gen. Reno ordered Lt. Colonel W. S. Clark to charge with the right wing of his regiment, the 21st Massachusetts, and take the brick kiln.\n\nLt. Col. Clark says in his report:\n\n\"At the moment of our arrival at the Cut, the enemy were busily engaged in removing ammunition from the cars which had just come down from New Bern with re-inforcements. At the first volley from Company C the enemy in great astonishment, fled from the road and trench to a ravine in the rear of the brick yard. General Reno ordered Color-bearer Bates to plant his flag upon the roof of a building within the enemy's entrenchments. General Reno, with Companies C, A, B, and H, of the right wing, dashed across the railroad up the steep bank and over the rifle trench on top into the brick yard. Here we were subjected to a most destructive crossfire from the enemy on both sides of the railroad and lost a large number of men in a very few minutes. The General supposing he had completely flanked the enemy's works, returned across the road to bring up the rest of his brigade; but just at this time a tremendous fire of musketry and artillery was opened from the redoubts hitherto unseen, which were nine in number, extending from the railroad more than a mile to the right into the forest.\n\n\"The General, now obliged to devote his attention to the enemy in front of his brigade, ordered the left wing of the Twenty-first Massachusetts not to cross the road, but to continue to fire upon the enemy in the first two redoubts. These troops consisted of the Thirty-third North Carolina and the Twenty-sixth North Carolina Regiments, and were the best armed and fought the most gallantly of any of the enemy's forces; their position was almost impregnable so long as their left flank resting on the railroad was defended. They kept up an incessant fire for three hours until their ammunition was exhausted, and the remainder of the rebel forces had retreated from that portion of their works lying between the river and the railroad.\"\n\nHaving quoted so freely from the Federal side, let us now see what was doing among the Confederates. It is seen, Brig. Gen. Lawrence O. Branch (NC) had but one (1) brigade to oppose three (3)but six (6) regments to oppose thirteen (13). These thirteen (13) Federal regiments were in full ranks. The 21st Massachusetts, of which we have been speaking, took into the battle 743 men. When Col. Reuben P. Campbell (7th NC Regiment) was informed by Col. James Sinclair (35th NC Regiment), \"under much excitement,\" that the enemy had flanked him and were coming up the trenches which had been vacated by the militia, Col. Campbell ordered Col. Sinclair to leave the works and charge bayonets upon the advancing columns; this Col. Sinclair failed to do, and left the field in confusion. Col. Campbell then ordered Lt. Col. Edward G. Haywood to have his men, the 7th NC Regiment, leave the works and charge the enemy. This was done in handsome style, and the enemy were driven over the breastworks and the guns of Brem's Battery that had fallen into their hands, were retaken. This charge was so impetuous that the enemy largely magnified the number of men that made it.\n\nSays Lt. Col. W.S. Clark, of the 21st Massachusetts Regiment, resuming our quotation from his report of the battle:\n\n\"Having been ordered into the brick yard and left there with my colors and the four companies above mentioned, and finding it impossible to remain there without being cut to pieces, I was compelled either to charge upon Captain Brem's Battery of flying artillery or retreat. Accordingly, I formed my handful of men (about 200) in line, the right resting on the breastworks of the enemy, and commenced firing upon the men and horses of the first piece. Three men and two horses having fallen, I gave the order to charge bayonets and went to the first gun. Leaving this in the hands of Captain Walcott and Private John Dunn, of Company B, I proceeded to the second gun, about 300 paces from the brick yard. By this time the three regiments of the rebel infantry, who had retreated from the breastworks to a ravine in the rear when we entered the brick yard, seeing that we were so few and received no support, rallied and advanced on us. The Thirty-fifth and Thirty-seventh North Carolina, supported by the Seventh North Carolina, came upon us from the ravine in splendid style, with their muskets at the right shoulder and halted. Most fortunately, or rather providentially, for us, they remained undecided for a minute or two, and then resolved on a movement which saved us from destruction. Instead of giving us a volley at once, they first hesitated, and then charged upon us without firing. I instantly commanded my men to spring over the parapet and ditch in front, and to retreat to the railroad, keeping as close as possible to the ditch. On the railroad I found Colonel Rodman with the Fourth Rhode Island Regiment waiting for orders, and I urged him to advance at once and charge upon their flank, as I had done.\"\n\nUp to this point in the battle, everything had gone on satisfactorily for the Confederates on the right of the railroad. Brig. Gen. Reno's attacks had been met and repulsed handsomely. The Confederate line of defense on the right of the railroad as heretofore stated, consisted of rifle pits and detached entrenchments in the form of lunettes and redans along the bank of Bullen's Creek, and across the swamp to the Weathersby Road, about one and one-quarter miles. A rifle pit near the railroad was occupied by Capt. Oscar R. Rand, with his Company D, about 77 men; by Company A, 68 men; and by 25 men from Company G; all under command of Maj. Abner B. Carmichael, of the 26th NC Regiment. Quoting from Capt. Rand's account of the battle, written shortly after his capture and addressed to Col. Zebulon B. Vance:\n\n\"About 7:30 a.m. the battle commenced on the left and for a time, extending from Fort Thompson along the whole line of the breastworks to the railroad, the roar of cannon and musketry was incessant. Within a few minutes after the battle had commenced, the enemy made his appearance on the right of the railroad directly in front of us. About one regiment (the left wing of the Twenty-first Massachusetts) took position between the railroad and Bullen's Creek, sheltering themselves in the woods and behind the logs, while the main body consisting of several regiments advanced under cover of the woods down the opposite side of the creek, occupying the heights and extending himself along our right.\n\n\"When the advance of the enemy had reached nearly opposite Major Carmichael's position, he gave the order to fire, and sent a volley full into the head of the advancing column. The enemy replied immediately and from this time to the close of the action, the firing never ceased. At first, the enemy shooting very badly, their balls flying high above our heads and cutting the boughs from the tops of the trees in our rear, whereas our men, under direction of Major Carmichael and other officers, took deliberate aim, sending death into their ranks. As soon as we were fairly engaged with this part of the enemy, the other part which held position between the railroad and the creek came up from under their cover and attempted to cross the railroad with a view to flank the main entrenchments and cut our lines in two.\n\n\"No sooner was this attempted than it was discovered, and every gun ordered to bear upon them. One well directed volley scattered this force. Many a poor fellow fell here to rise no more, for they were well exposed.\n\n\"Just at this time, about half an hour after the battle had commenced, Colonel [Clarke M.] Avery, who had been held in reserve, arrived with the Thirty-third regiment. He with four companies entered the rifle pits occupied by us, while four other companies under Major [William] Gaston Lewis, were ordered to occupy an advanced rifle pit nearest to the brick yard. This movement was attended with great danger, and was gallantly executed. Major Lewis had to advance a space of 150 yards over fallen timber, all the while exposed to the enemy's fire, and without being able to return it. He gained the position, however, and held it during the remainder of the action.\n\n\"The battle now raged furiously ;tbe enemy throwing themselves along our right so as to gain the point from which he could fire directly into our trenches, and Colonel Avery, ably seconded by Major Carmichael, using every effort to prevent it. In this they were somewhat aided by the artillery and infantry, part of the Twenty-sixth Regiment and two companies of the Thirty-third Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel [Robert F.] Hokeon the right of us, only two or three companies of which, however, were within range. The intention of the enemy was plain. They were to engage us hotly on both wings, and then with a sufficient force carry the railroad, which, when gained, would cut our lines in two and be equivalent to flanking us right and left. No troops were at anytime stationed along the line from the extreme left of the Twenty-sixth Regiment to the brick kilns, a distance of over 200 yards, until Colonel Avery ordered Major Lewis with four companies of the Thirty-third Regiment, to occupy it. There were also no troops defending the line from the brick kiln to where the main breastworks touched the railroad, a distance of 200 yards or more.\n\n\"The enemy now determined to carry this part of the line of our defense. What part the militia, who were stationed along the main breastworks nearest the railroad, and the Thirty-fifth Regiment, who were next to them, took in resisting this attempt, I cannot say. The brick kilns and other buildings excluded the view. These troops were certainly near enough, and by a proper change of front could have thrown themselves upon the enemy and overwhelmed him.\n\n\"The force attempting this point of our works, I do not believe to have been more than one regiment. (It was only the right wing of the Twenty-first Massachusetts Regiment), and the main resistance he encountered came from the rifle pits occupied by Major Carmichael's and Major Lewis' commands. The enemy was held in check for some considerable time, but at last he succeeded and carried the railroad between the brick kilns and the main breastworks and a part of his force passed in. They had advanced but a short distance, however, when they were met by a part of the Seventh North Carolina Regiment and driven out at the point of the bayonet, the Yankees leaping over the breastworks into the ditch beyond.\n\n\"It was during this time that we met with a severe loss in the death of Major Carmichaelas true a patriot and as brave a gentleman as ever lived. His death occurred in this manner: Colonel Avery and Major Carmichael were standing together at the corner of the traverse nearest the railroad. They were watching the action on the left and beyond the brick yard, when a single ball, whether aimed at the party or not, entered the mouth of Major Carmichael as he was speaking, and passed out at the back of the neck. I was standing at his side when he fell. He died instantly A feeling of bitter grief ran through the trenches as he fell, for there was not a man in the Twenty-sixth regiment who was not devotedly attached to him. During the battle, Major Carmichael wore a small Confederate flag, perhaps three by four inches in dimension, mounted on a staff and attached to his cap. This may have attracted the fatal shot.\"\n\nThe flag had been given the Major by a lady of New Bern, and he had promised her he would wear it in his cap in his first battle. It was doubtless the cause of his being singled out by some sharpshooter.\n\nWe will now return to the left of the Confederate line between the railroad and Fort Thompson. Brig. Gen. Lawrence O. Branch's (NC) paucity of troops prevented his taking advantage of Lt. Col. Edward G. Haywood's brilliant bayonet charge with the 7th NC Regiment. The enemy were driven back, but there were no soldiers to occupy the vacant line of defense at the brick yard, or to take the place in the works vacated by the retreat of the militia and the 35th NC Regiment. Says Brig. Gen. Branch, in his report:\n\n\"The whole of the militia had abandoned their positions. Colonel [James] Sinclair's Regiment very quickly followed their example. This laid open Haywood's right and a portion of the breastworks was left vacant. I had not a man with whom to occupy it, and the enemy soon passed in a column along the railroad and through a portion of the cut down timber in front which marched up behind the breastworks to attack what remained of Colonel [Reuben P.] Campbell's command.\"\n\nHow this was done we will explain by quoting from Federal Brig. Gen. John G. Parke, commanding the force supporting Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno's Brigade attacking the Confederate right wing:\n\n\"Lieutenant Colonel Clark, commanding the Twenty-first Massachusetts, meeting Colonel Rodman, of the Fourth Rhode Island, informed him he had been in the works and assured him of the feasibility of again taking the entrenchments.\n\n\"I approved of this course on the part of Colonel Rodman, and at once ordered the Eighth Connecticut and the Fifth Rhode Island to his support. Passing quickly by the rifle pits which opened on us with little injury, we entered in rear of the entrenchments and the regiments in a gallant manner carried gun after gun, until the whole nine brass pieces on their front line were in our possession, the enemy sullenly retiring, firing only three guns from the front and three others from the fort on their left (Thompson). The Eighth Connecticut and Fifth Rhode Island followed immediately in the rear, and in support of the Fourth Rhode Island. Although now in possession of the entire works of the enemy between the railroad and the river, the heavy firing on our left and beyond the railroad proved that General Reno's Brigade was still hotly engaging the enemy.\n\n\"I ordered the Fifth Rhode Island Battalion and the Eighth Connecticut to advance cautiously. Captain J. N. King then reported that the enemy still occupied rifle pits along side the railroad back of the brick yard and a series of redoubts extending beyond the railroad and in General Reno's front. I then had the Fourth Rhode Island brought up and ordered the Colonel to drive the enemy from his position. This order was executed in a most gallant manner. The regiment charged the enemy in flank, while a simultaneous charge was made by General Reno in front, thus driving the enemy from his last stronghold.\"\n\nFederal Brig. Gene. Ambrose E. Burnside in his report of the battle, says:\n\n\"General Foster seeing our forces inside the enemy's lines, immediately ordered his brigade to charge, when the whole line of breastworks between the railroad and the river were most gallantly carried. After the cheers of our men had subsided, it was discovered that General Reno was still engaged with the enemy on the left, upon which General Parke moved back with a view of getting in rear of the enemy's forces in the entrenchments to the left of the railroad. General Foster, also moved forward with one of his regiments, with a view of getting to the rear.\"\n\nIt was to this last regiment that Col. Clark M. Avery (33rd NC Regiment) and Capt. Oscar R. Rand (Company D) surrendered. This regiment Federal Brig. Gen. John G. Foster marched down the county road leading to New Bern, until opposite the camp of the 26th NC Regiment, when turning to the left, he marched through the woods and took position on both sides of the railroad; he also brought up four pieces of artillery and placed them in position.\n\nLet us now return to Capt. Rand's account of the closing incidents of the battle on his part of the line:\n\n\"The action at this place had now continued for more than three hours. Our men from first to last poured in their fire with deliberate aim. Colonel Avery was everywhere along the trenches animating the men by his presence. I may say that nearly every man did his duty nobly. Many were the narrow escapes. Colonel Avery received a ball through his cap, and many received balls through their hats or clothes. The respective forces were all the time within from two to three hundred yards of each other; all had been silent along our lines, both right and left of us for some time. Just at this time, while we were so intently engaged on our front, we were fired into on our left by a considerable body of the enemy who had taken position in the edge of the woods beyond the railroad. This determined the conflict so far as we were concerned. Colonel Avery saw in an instant that nothing now remained but to draw off the troops. The order was given and we went out of the trenches amidst a perfect storm of bullets from both right and left.\"\n\nThe intention of Col. Clark M. Avery (33rd NC Regiment) was to rally the men and form line on the railroad. He succeeded in a great measure, and marched diagonally through the woods, a distance of three or four hundred (300-400) yards, for a point on the railroad just above the camp of the 26th NC Regiment. My company occupied the extreme left of the rifle pit, and became the right of the line in retreat. The woods were so filled with underbrush that we could see but a short distance before us. When we had advanced far enough to see through the opening made for the railroad track, and had nearly reached the place where we were to form line, we discovered just across the railroad, and about fifty or seventy-five (50-75) yards in front of our right, four (4) pieces of the enemy's artillery and a regiment of infantry deployed on each side and extending across the railroad. An officer immediately rode out and demanded a surrender. Seeing ourselves surrounded and no hope of escape, Col. Avery, and those on the right, surrendered. Those on the left, being further off, and aided by the cover of the woods, nearly all escaped. The surrender took place at 11:30 o'clock a.m. The number of prisoners taken at this place were about one hundred and fifty (150). The number of prisoners taken in all were two hundred and six (206). This admirable and intelligent account of the battle was prepared by Capt. Oscar R. Rand, shortly after his capture. It is accompanied with a diagram of the battlefield made by Lt. Woodbury Wheeler, of Latham's Battery, who was also captured.\n\nThese gentlemen were permitted to visit the battlefield from one end to the other, and they carefully made notes for the purpose of giving an account of the battle. Space forbids my quoting the report in its entirety. I will only make one further quotation: ''We received no orders to retreat, neither did we receive orders of any kind during the whole course of the battle. The woods were very thick, which, coupled with the mist of the morning, made it impossible to see our troops on either side. We retreated because we were exposed to a crossfire, and because it would have been certain destruction to have held our places five (5) minutes longer. No officer or man dreamed of such a thing as being taken prisoner. We could have made good our retreat if we had received the order as others did.\"\n\nIn justice to Brig. Gen. Lawrence O. Branch (NC), on this point, I quote from his official report: \"Finding the day was lost, my next care was to secure the retreat. I dispatched two couriers to Colonel Avery and two to Colonel Vance, with orders to fall back to the bridges, etc., etc.\" These couriers never delivered their orders. This account will be incomplete without making quotation from Colonel Vance's and Lt. Colonel Robert F. Hoke's reports of this battle. Lt. Colonel Hoke says:\n\n\"The regiment moved up to the scene of action in fine style, Colonel Avery in command in the center, I of the right wing, Major Lewis of the left. Colonel Avery gave the command to fire, which seemed to have great effect, as the enemy scampered. Major Lewis then moved to the right of the railroad with several (four) companies, and engaged the enemy from that time until after 12 o'clock. He behaved most gallantly, was in the hottest of the whole battlefield. He repulsed the enemy time and again, and twice charged them with detachments from his companies, and each time made them flee. Our loss was greater at that point than any other, as he had to fight to his front, right, and left, but still maintained his position. Finding the enemy were getting in strong force on our right, and were going to turn our right flank, as there were no troops between our regiment and the left of Colonel Vance's companies, a distance of a quarter of a mile, I moved quickly with Captain [Oliver T.] Park's company, and sent a messenger to Colonel Avery for another company. He immediately sent me Captain [Jeremiah M.] Kesler's company. I ordered the whole to fire, which did great execution, as the enemy fell and fled, but soon appeared in strong force and again we drove them back, but soon they again appeared in stronger force, and engaged us, which continued until 12:30 o'clock. At 12:15 o'clock I saw a United States flag flying upon one of our works, but saw Colonel Avery still fighting. I did not know that Colonel Avery and Major Lewis had fallen back until I saw the enemy upon my left with several regiments, and about fifty yards to the rear of the position Colonel Avery had occupied. I ordered the men under my command to fall back, but to do so in order. We were hotly fired at as we fell back.\"\n\nI next quote from Col. Zebulon B. Vance's report of the battle:\n\n\"The regiment was posted by Lieutenant Colonel Burgwyn in the series of redans, constructed by me on the right of the railroad, in the rear of Bullen's Branch, extending from the railroad to the swamp, about 500 yards from the road by Weathersby. At this road I had constructed the night before a breastwork, commanding the passage of the swamp, and there was placed a section of Brem's Artillery, Lieutenant Williams commanding, and Captain [Robert B.] McRae's company of infantry, with a portion of Captain [George W.] Hayes' and 1st Lieutenant William A. Graham's Second Cavalry (9th NC Volunteers) dismounted. About 2 o'clock Friday morning (14 March) I pushed Companies B, E, and K, of my right wing across the small swamp alluded to so as to make my extreme right rest on the battery at the Weathersby Road. During the day, two companies of the Thirty-third Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Hoke, about 9 a.m., were placed in the redans vacated by my right companies.\n\n\"The battle began on my left wing about 7:30 a.m., extending towards my right by degrees, until about 8:30 a.m., all the troops in my command were engaged as far as the swamp referred to. The fight was kept up until about 12 o'clock, when information was brought me by Captain J. J. Young, my Quartermaster, who barely escaped with his life in getting to me, that the enemy in great force had turned my left by the railroad track at the woods and the brick yard, had pillaged my camp, were tiring in reverse on my left wing, and were several hundred yards up the railroad between me and New Bern. Also that all the troops were in full retreat except my own.\n\n\"Without hesitation, I gave the order to retreat. My men jumped out of the trenches, rallied, and formed in the woods without panic or confusion, and having first sent a messenger to Lieutenant Colonel Burgwyn to follow with the forces on the right, we struck across the Weathersby's Road to Bryce's Creek. On arriving at the creek, found only one small boat, capable of carrying only three men. The creek here is too deep to ford and seventy-five yards wide. Some plunged in and swam over, and swimming over myself, I rode down to Captain Whitford's house on the Trent River, and through the kindness of Mr. Kit. Toy, procured three more small boats. Carrying one on our shoulders, we hurried up to the crossing. In the meantime, Lieutenant Colonel Burgwyn arrived with the forces of the right wing in excellent condition, and assisted me with the greatest coolness and efficiency in getting the troops across, which, after four hours of hard labor, and the greatest anxiety, we succeeded in doing. Lieutenant Colonel Burgwyn saw the last man over before he entered the boat. I regret to say that three men were drowned in crossing. A large Yankee force were drawn up in view of our scouts, about one mile away, and their skirmishers appeared just as the rear got over.\"\n\nOf the deaths of Maj. Abner B. Carmichael and Capt. William P. Martin, Colo. Zebulon B. Vance thus feelingly speaks:\n\n''Major A. B. Carmichael fell about 11 a.m. by a shot through the head, while gallantly holding his post on the left, under a most galling fire. A braver, nobler soldier never fell on field of battle. Generous and open-hearted, as he was brave and chivalrous, he was endeared to the whole regiment. Honored be his memory. Soon thereafter, Captain William P. Martin, of Company H, also fell, near the regimental colors. Highly respected as a man, brave and determined as a soldier, he was equally regretted by his command, and by all who knew him. Lieutenant [James] Porter, of Company A, was also left behind wounded. Captain Andrew N. McMillan was badly wounded, but got away safely.\n\n\"Once across Bryce's Creek, we were joined by Lieutenant Colonel [Robert F.] Hoke, Thirty-third Regiment, with a portion of his command, and took the road for Trenton. We marched night and day, stopping at no time for rest or sleep more than four hours. We arrived at Kinston safely about noon on 16 March, having marched fifty miles in about thirty-six hours. I cannot conclude this report,\" says Colonel Vance, ''without mentioning in terms of the highest praise the spirit of determination and power of endurance manifested by the troops during the hardships and sufferings of our march. Drenched with rain, with blistered feet, without sleep, many sick and wounded, and almost naked, they toiled on through day and all the weary watches of the night without murmuring, cheerfully, and with subordination, evincing most thoroughly the high qualities in adversity which military men learn to value even more than courage on the battle field.\"\n\nWe close this account of the battle with one or two incidents. When Bryce's Creek was reached, there was some confusion, and a natural eagerness to get across, as the enemy's guns were heard in the distance. Many attempted to swim across, and several were drowned before the officers could restrain them. Colonel Vance, to inspire confidence, spurred his horse in the creek, the animal refusing to swim, the Colonel became unseated and weighed down with his accoutrements, he sank from view in the dark water of the stream and was about to be drowned, when assistance was rendered him, and he reached the opposite side in safety. Lt..Colonel Henry K. Burgwyn and his college mate, Lieutenant William A. Graham of Company K, 9th NC Volunteers (Second Cavalry), taking their stand on opposite sides of a path leading to the stream, with swords crossed, counted the men off in boat load lots as they were called out, and in this way without confusion or crowding, all were successfully ferried over and these two officers were the last to step aboard.\n\nMaj. William A. Graham, so widely known in the State for his prominence in agricultural matters, at the battle of New Bern was 1st Lieutenant in command of Company K, 2nd Cavalry, and the writer has been so fortunate as to get him for an eye witness account of that part of the battlefield where his command was posted, as follows:\n\n\"My company (K) was dismounted and placed in the brick yard. About sun set was ordered to report to Colonel Vance, Twenty-sixth North Carolina Troops, who sent me to Lieutenant Colonel Burgwyn, commanding right wing of the Twenty-sixth Regiment and the companies on the road (Weathersby). Lt. Colonel Burgwyn placed my company on picket some half mile or more beyond the bridge, and he, with writer, scouted on flank of the pickets. The axes of the enemy could be heard cutting a road along the railroad.\n\n\"Next morning Captain [George W.] Hayes, of Company A, Second Cavalry, reported. The pickets were called in and everything made ready for the battle, The forces at the road (Weathersby) consisted of Companies A and K, Second Cavalry, a section of the Charlotte Battery, Lieutenant A. B. Williams in command and Captain [Robert B.] McRae's independent company of infantry. Company K connected the force in the road with the right of the Twenty-sixth Regiment. No enemy appeared in our front and when Lt. Colonel Burgwyn began forming the companies of the Twenty-sixth in rear of the entrenchments, we had no idea we had been defeated, but thought it was probably for pursuit. Going to him for orders, he informed me that we had been defeated on the left and must try and beat the enemy to New Bern.\n\n\"Everything moved off in fair order until getting near the crossing of the railroad, a scout announced the enemy coming up the railroad only a short distance off. Lt. Colonel Burgwvn ordered the artillery and Captain Hayes' company, who were mounted, to save themselves, which they proceeded to do. Lt. Colonel Burgwyn, with the infantry, took to the left through the woods. He dismounted his orderly and gave me one of his horses and ordered me to scout to the left and forward to see if the bridges were standing. Coming out at the camp of the Thirty-seventh Regiment, I saw both bridges on fire and so reported. We then struck the trail of Colonel Vance's retreat and overtook his command at Bryce's Creek, endeavoring to cross in a boat, carrying three men. Colonel Vance had swam his horse across the creek and had gone to hunt other boats. It was reported that the enemy were close upon us and at least half of the men threw their arms in the creek, saying they did not intend that the Yankees should have them. There was great confusion. Lt. Colonel Burgwyn was as cool as if nothing unusual was transpiring. Calling such of the officers as he saw to him, he announced he would hold a 'council of war,' told the council we were responsible for the action of the men, and must form them and keep order. This was done. Men were sent up and down the creek to hunt boats.\n\n\"In the afternoon a negro man who belonged to Toy, came to the opposite side of the creek and announced there was a boat a mile or so down the creek where Lt. Colonel Hoke (R. F.) had crossed. The men moved off through the swamp down the creek, sometimes up to the armpit in the mire. The negro went along on the other side, and when he reached the boat he halloed and we went to him. I got into the boat and had just taken a seat, when Lt. Colonel Burgwyn called me to him and said I must help him keep the men from overloading and sinking the boat; the boat would hold eighteen. I stood facing Lt. Colonel Burgwyn, and each time as we counted eighteen we halted the column. When we all had crossed except Lt. Colonel Burgwyn and myself, I entered the boat and, leading the horse into the water, swam him over along its side. The boat returned and Colonel Burgwyn came over in like style. It was now near sunset. Lt. Colonel Burgwyn took command of such formation as there was and held it until we reached Trenton next day, where we found Colonel Vance and several hundred men of the different commands which had been at New Bern. Colonel Vance assumed command and brought the troops to Kinston.\"\n\nWhen Capt. Joseph J. Young (AQM) met the fleeing militia, he tried to rally themexhorted them to go back and rejoin their comrades fighting in the works, saying, their conduct would forever disgrace them; that the papers would be full of their cowardice, etc., etc. One of them replied: \"I had rather fill twenty newspapers than one grave.\" Some of the militia did not stop running until they reached New Bern. One was found dead on the rear platform of the last train as it crossed the river into New Bern, expiring as he reached the train just starting, having run all the way from the battlefield, about five (5) miles.\n\nTo make this account historically complete, I append list of the troops engaged on either side, and the casualties sustained.\n\nKnown Casualties at the First Battle of New Bern, NC on March 14, 1862\n\nSo much space is given to the account of this, the first battle in which the regiment was engaged, because it was its first battle, and the conduct of its officers and men was so altogether creditable. No troops could have borne themselves better under the ordeal to which they were exposed. The rapidity of Federal Brig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's advance took Brig. Gen. Lawrence O. Branch (NC) by surprise. The latter expected at least a day's delay at Fisher's Landing, and at the Croatan breastworks above Otter Creek, but there was no fight at these advanced points of defense, and nothing delayed the enemy's rapid approach. Another day and the brick yard would have been defended by artillery, and this point secure. Brig. Gen. Burnside would have failed in his attempt to capture New Bern. The disparity of forces was great, but Brig. Gen. John G. Foster, with his five (5) regiments, opposed by Col. Reuben P. Campbell and Col. Charles C. Lee, with their three (3), could make no headway on the Confederate left; and Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, with his four (4) regiments, assisted by Brig. Gen. John G. Parke, was regularly driven back by the 26th NC Regiment with the 33rd NC Regiment on the right. One (1) regiment to have replaced the 350 militia, and the 35th NC Regiment, would have stood as firm as the others, and there would have been no undefended part of the line to let the enemy through; and reinforcements, which were hurrying to Brig. Gen. Branch's assistance, would have readied him during the day.\n\nBrig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside well won his promotion as Major General, which was the result of his victory, whereas on the Confederate side, this battle introduced to the military world names to become distinguished in the annals of the war. The press of the State heaped eulogies upon the officers and men of the 26th NC Regiment and recruits flocked to its standard.\n\nCol. Zebulon B. Vance applied for and received permission to recruit his regiment to a legion, and was in a fair way to succeed, several companies having arrived in camp, and others were at home drilling, when he gave up the attempt in disgust at what he thought was \"the opposition to the scheme on the part of the State and Confederate authorities,\" and the companies were disbanded.\n\nWhile resting at Kinston, after the battle of New Bern, Capt. Nathaniel P. Rankin of Company F, was elected Major vice Abner B. Carmichael, killed; and 1st Lt. Clement Dowd was elected Captain of Company H, vice William P. Martin, killed; 1st Lt. Joseph R. Ballew was promoted to be Captain of Company F.\n\nThe troops around Kinston were now reorganized. Brig. Gen. Samuel G. French (MS), on March 16th, reached Goldsborough and relieved Brig. Gen. Lawrence O. Branch (NC) of the command of the District of Pamlico; and on March 19th, Brig. Gen. Richard C. Gatlin (NC) was relieved of command on account of ill health, and Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes (NC), assigned to the command of the Department of North Carolina. On March 17th, Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom was ordered to Goldsborough \"for duty with troops in the field,\" and a brigade was formed for him consisting of the 24th, 25th, 26th, 35th, 48th, and 49th NC Regiments. Under this gallant and accomplished soldier and disciplinarian, numerous drills and strict camp regulations prevailed until on June 20, 1862, the brigade was ordered to Virginia to join General Robert E. Lee's army, then confronting Federal Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan below Richmond.\n\nRE-ORGANIZATION FOR THE WAR.\n\nThe 26th NC Regiment was a twelve-months regiment, and in the Spring of 1862 re-enlisted for the war. The men in the ranks were given the right to elect their company officers, and the latter the right to elect field officers.\n\nMany changes took place in the regiment at its re-organization. Col. Zebulon B. Vance was always most popular with his men. He sought and obtained to the fullest extent the love of his soldiers, was always solicitous of their welfare and comfort, leaving chiefly to his second in command matters of drill and discipline. At no time was there any doubt as to his re-election.\n\nAs to Lt. Col. Henry K. Burgwyn, had the election taken place before the regiment had in actual battle experienced the benefit of drill and strict obdience to orders, he could not have been re-elected. Says an officer of the regiment (Capt. Thomas J. Cureton): \"Colonel Burgwyn was emphatically a worker in camp, careful of the comforts of his men, constantly drilling; he believed in discipline and endeavored to bring his regiment to the highest state of efficiency. I always found him strict in camp, so much so, that up to the battle of New Bern he was very unpopular, and I often heard the men say if they ever got into a fight with him what they would do, etc., etc.\"\n\nThe morning before the fight, Federal Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's gunboats were coming up the river, shelling the banks, Col. Vance was placed in command of the right of our line, or in other words, acting Brigadier General. Lt. Col. Burgwyn was, therefore, in command of the 26th NC Regiment. He suspected the feelings of the men towards him. He formed the regiment at the point where the breastworks crossed the railroad, and addressed them in substance as follows: \"Soldiers! the enemy are before you, and you will soon be in combat. You have the reputation of being one of the best drilled regiments in the service. Now I wish you to prove yourselves one of the best fighting. Men, stand by me, and I will by you.\" The response was unanimous\"We will,\" from the men. Next day the battle was fought. Only the left companies of the regiment under the command of Maj. Abner B. Carmichael, and Capt. Oscar R. Rand and Capt. William P. Martin, were most actively engaged, and suffered heavily. The right companies, when they found the enemy on their flank and getting in their rear, had to fall back to find the bridge across the Trent River, on fire, our troops all gone, and the only way of escape was to cross Bryce's Creek.\n\nWhen we got there only a small boat that would carry two (2) people at a time could be found, Col. Vance rode his horse in the creek, which refused to swim, and the colonel was very nearly drowned before assistance reached him. Several of the men were drowned trying to swim the creek. When the boat reached the bank we were on, an officer called to Lt. Col. Burgwyn to get in first. He was met with the reply: \"I will never cross until the last man of my regiment is over.\" Nor did he till the last man was over.\n\nWe retreated up to Trenton Court House and expected pursuit. Lt. Col. Burgwyn was always in the rear. From this time on he had the entire confidence of his men and was their pride and love. Col. Vance and Lt. Col. Burgwyn received practically the unanimous vote of the regiment.\n\nCHANGES IN THE OFFICERS AT RE-ORGANIZATION.\n\n1st Lt. James S. Kendall of Company K was elected Major. This gallant officer and accomplished soldier only survived his promotion a few weeks, dying before the regiment left for Virginia, from Yellow Fever, contracted at Wilmington while on furlough. 1st Lt. William Wilson became Captain of Company B; 2nd Lt. James T. Adams became Captain of Company D; 2nd Lt. John T. Jones became Captain of Company I; 2nd Lt. John C. McLauchlin became Captain of Company K; and, 1st Lt. Stephen W. Brewer became Captain of Company E.\n\nA WOMAN RECRUIT.\n\nWhile the 26th NC Regiment was in camp in and around Kinston, after the battle of New Bern, many recruits joined the command. Among them were two (2) young men, giving their names as L. M. and Samuel Blalock. They enlisted in Capt. Joseph R. Ballew's company (F) and were brought to the regiment by Private James D. Moore, of Company F. On the way from their home, in Caldwell County, to join the regiment, Moore was informed in strict confidence by L. M. (Keith) Blalock, that Samuel was his young wife, and that he would only enlist on condition that his wife be allowed to enlist with him. This was agreed to by Moore, who was acting as recruiting officer, and Moore also promised not to divulge the secret. Sam Blalock is described as a good looking boy, aged 16, weight about 130 pounds, height 5 feet and 4 inches, dark hair; her husband (Keith) was over 6 feet in height. Sam Blalock's disguise was never penetrated. She drilled and did the duties of a soldier as any other member of the company, and was very adept at learning the manual and drill.\n\nIn about two months her husband, who was suffering from hernia and from poison from sumac, was discharged, and Sam informed his Captain and Colonel Vance, that he was a woman, whereupon she was discharged and permitted to join her husband. On returning home, Keith Blalock and his wife, now known by her real name, \"Malinda,'' joined Kirk's command, an organized body of Union troops, made up largely of deserters and bushwhackers, operating in the Western part of the State. In the Spring of 1864, while the said James D. Moore was at home at his father's, at a place called the Globe, recovering from the wound he had received at Gettysburg, the house was attacked by Keith and Malinda Blalock, and their gang, and Carroll Moore, his father, severely wounded. Several of the marauders were wounded, and among them Malinda.\n\nAgain in the fall of 1864, Keith and his raiders attacked Mr. Carroll Moore's house, and were again driven off. This time Keith was shot in the head, and one eye put out. After the war, Keith attempted merchandizing in Mitchell County and was a candidate for the Legislature on the Republican ticket, but was defeated, and about 1892 he and his wife went to Texas. They subsequently returned to North Carolina, and at this time (1901) are living in Mitchell County. Malinda Blalock's maiden name was Pritchard, and her brother, Riley Pritchard, was United States Commissioner in President Benjamin Harrison's Administration.\n\nMALVERN HILL, JULY 1, 1862.\n\nWe were ordered to Virginia on June 20, 1862. Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's (NC) Brigade was directed to report to Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger (VA) on the Williamsburg Road, and a little before dark on the night of June 25, Col. Zebulon B. Vance's Regiment relieved the 24th NC Regiment on picket duty in front of the enemy at Oak Grove, VA.\n\nThe night was very dark, and with no one to direct them, the regiment took position on one side of a rail fence and in front of a hedgerow. As it happened, the enemy were lying down in line of battle on the opposite side, and abiding their time. After the 26th NC Regiment had gotten quieted down for the night, in entire ignorance of the presence of the enemy, the latter suddenly arose, thrust their guns through the fence rails, and opened fire. So close were they to us, says a member of the regiment, that the beards of many of the men were singed. The surprise was so great that seven (7) of the companies on the right of the regiment went to the rear; however, Companies G, H, and K, undaunted by the nearness and numbers of the enemy, remained on the field. On the next morning those companies were highly complimented by their field officers for their exceedingly creditable conduct in holding their lines during the night under such trying circumstances. Again, on picket on June 27th, the 26th NC Regiment was pushed to the front and took possession of some unfinished works of the enemy Just as it was about to be relieved, it was attacked, but returned the fire so briskly and with such effect as to drive the enemy back.\n\nQuoting from so much of Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's report of the part his brigade took in the battle of Malvern Hill, as applies to the 26th NC Regiment, he says:\n\n\"At 7 p.m. (July 1, 1862) I received the third request from [Major] General [John B.] Magruder, that he must have aid, if only one regiment. The message was so pressing that I at once directed Colonel [William J.] Clarke to go with his regiment (Twenty-fourth North Carolina ). The brigade was at once put in motion, Colonel Clarke had already gone, Colonel [Henry M.] Rutledge [25th NC Regiment] next, then Colonel [Matthew W.] Ransom [35th NC Regiment], Colonels [Stephen D.] Ramseur [49th NC Regiment]. and [Zebulon B.] Vance [26th NC Regiment], all moved to the scene of conflict at the double quick. As each of the three first named regiments reached the field, they were at once thrown into action by General Magruder's orders. As the last two arrived, they were halted by me to regain their breath, and then pushed forward under as fearful fire as the mind can conceive.\n\n\"Ordering the whole to the right so as to be able to form under cover, I brought the brigade in line within 200 yards of the enemy's batteries. It was now twilight; the line was put in motion and moved steadily forward to within less than 100 yards of the batteries. The enemy seemed unaware of our movements. Masses of his troops appeared to be moving from his left towards his right. Just at this instant the brigade raised a tremendous shout, and the enemy at once wheeled into line and opened upon us a perfect sheet of fire from muskets and the batteries. We steadily advanced to within twenty yards of the guns. The enemy had concentrated his forces to meet us. Our onward movement was checked; the line wavered and fell back before a fire, the intensity of which is beyond description. It was a bitter disappointment to be compelled to yield when their guns seemed almost in our hands.\"\n\nThe losses sustained by Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's Brigade from June 26th to July 1st, 1862, inclusive, embraced three Colonels wounded, one Lieutenant Colonel killed, several field officers and many company officers, and a total of 499 privates killed and wounded. Casualties separately stated:\n\nRegiments >> 24th 25th 26th 35th 49th Killed >> 9 22 6 18 14 Wounded >> 42 106 40 91 75\n\nINCIDENTS OF THE BATTLE.\n\nDuring the charge of the regiment at Malvern Hill, Capt. John R. Lane, of Company G, had the pocket of his coat cut open by a ball, and the contents fell on the ground. Among these was a package wrapped in newspaper, containing the month's pay of his company. Next morning Capt. Lane discovered his loss, obtained permission to go and hunt for it, and strange to say, found the package untouched, lying in the open ground where it bad fallen among the dead and wounded.\n\nAfter the regiment had taken its position for the night after the charge, and the officers and men were resting on their arms, Capt. Lane lay down between two (2) of his soldiers and fell asleep. Next morning when he awoke the man on his right and left had both been killed by the enemy's fire while asleep, and their deaths not discovered. They awoke to the sound of the \"reveille\" in another world.\n\nWhile the men were lying down in line of battle, waiting the order to charge, they were subjected to a furious shelling, and there was more or less dodging of the head as the missiles whizzed by. \"Why are you so polite in the presence of the enemy,\" remarked Colonel Vance. A rabbit was flushed by the line as it advanced, which caused the men to raise a shout as it ran past them, whereupon Col. Vance joined in the cry, saying: \"Go it cotton tail. If I had no more reputation to lose than you have, I would run too.\"\n\nOn July 7th, Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's (NC) Brigade was ordered back to Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes' (NC) command, and on July 31, 1862, Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC) relieved Maj. Gen. Holmes in command of the Department of North Carolina, and on August 11th, Brig. Gen. James Johnston Pettigrew (NC), who had been severely wounded and captured at the battle of Seven Pines on June 1, 1862, was assigned to the command of Petersburg, and given the brigade then under the command of Colonel Junius Daniel.\n\nTWENTY-SIXTH REGIMENT DETACHED FROM RANSOM'S AND ASSIGNED TO PETTIGREW's BRIGADE.\n\nCol. Zebulon B. Vance's election as Governor in August of 1862, caused a vacancy in the Colonelcy of the 26th NC Regiment. The Lieutenant Colonel was not 21 years of age, and the opposition of Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom to his promotion on account of his age, the General saying: \"He wanted no boy Colonel in his brigade,\" was well known to the regiment, and indignantly resented.\n\nApplication was made through the proper channels for a transfer to some other brigade, and on August 26, 1862, by special order No. 199, from the Adjutant and Inspector General (A.& I.G.) office, at Richmond, the 26th NC Regiment was detached and ordered to report to Brig. Gen. Samuel G. French (MS), at Petersburg, VA, for duty with the brigade formerly commanded by Brig. Gen. James G. Martin (NC).\n\nReferring to the election of Col. Zebulon B. Vance as Governor, one of the regiment writes as follows:\n\n\"Though rejoicing that he had been chosen Governor of the State by such a complimentary majority, with a pang of regret we saw Colonel, now Governor-elect Z. B. Vance, exchange the sword for the helm of State. He received almost the unanimous support of the regiment, there being only seven votes cast against him, which well attests his popularity among his troops.\n\n\"His separation from us was quite sad, all feeling the heavy loss to the regiment. In his farewell address to the regiment, he, with his usual truthfulness and sincerity, scorned to hold out any false promises to those who had been under his command, telling them plainly, that all they could expect was 'War! War! War! Fight till the end.' But in the promotion of Lt. Col. Henry K.l Burgwyn to the Colonelcy of the regiment, we gained an officer, young, gallant and brave, and eminently fitted to fill the vacancy.\"\n\nSpeaking of the transfer of the regiment to Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade, this writer goes on to say: \"Never was there a more fortunate change. It seemed as if Pettigrew and Burgwyn were made for each other. Alike in bravery, alike in action, alike in their military bearing, alike in readiness for battle and in skillful horsemanship, they were beloved alike by the soldiers of the Twenty-sixth. Each served as a pattern for the other, and in imitating each other they reached the highest excellence possible of attainment in every trait which distinguishes the ideal soldier.\" It will be of pathetic interest to state in addition to the above eloquent panegyric, that both Brig. Gen. Pettigrew and Col. Burgwyn were alumni of the State University, and fell on the field of battle within a few days of each other, the one on Gettysburg's gory field (Burgwyn) on July 1, 1863; the other (Pettigrew), commanding the rear guard of the army on its retreat across the Potomac River at 1st Hagerstown (aka Falling Waters), mortally wounded on July 14, 1863, died three days later.\n\nThe promotion of Lt. Col. Henry K. Burgwyn, and the death of Maj. James S. Kendall, who had been sick since his election, required the filling of the positions of Lieutenant Colonel and Major. A board of examination having been appointed to pass upon the qualifications of all officers before their promotion, Capt. John R. Lane, of Company G, and Capt. John T. Jones, of Company I, were summoned for examination, and obtaining the favorable report of the board, which was composed of Col. Henry K. Burgwyn, of the 26th NC Regiment, Col. Thomas Singletary, of the 44th NC Regiment, and Lt. Colonel T. L. Hargrave, of the 47th NC Regiment, duly received their commissions as Lieutenant Colonel and Major, respectively. About this time, Capt. Joseph R. Ballew of Company F resigned and 1st Lt. Romulus M. Tuttle was promoted to be Captain of this company, to become famous above all other companies in the army, from the fact that every member present, numbering ninety-one (91), was killed or wounded in the battle of Gettysburg. Capt. J.J.C. Steele, of Company B, also resigned, and 1st Lt. William Wilson became Captain. 2nd Lt. Henry C. Albright and 1st Lt. Nero G. Bradford were promoted to be Captains of Companies G and I, respectively.\n\nPETTIGREW'S BRIGADE.\n\nThis brigade to become so famous in military annals, was composed of the 11th, 26th, 44th, 47th, and 52nd NC Regiments. Of the commander of this brigade, later on in this sketch a more extended notice will be given. He was, at the time of its organization, convalescent from the severe wound received on June 1, 1862, at the battle of Seven Pines, and was placed in command of Petersburg in the fall of 1862. During the months of September, October, November, and December of 1862, Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade was either on duty in Virginia or North Carolina.\n\nThe faithfulness with which Col. Henry K. Burgwyn disciplined the regiment, much improved its efficiency, and it became known as one of the best drilled regiments in the service. In his labors in this behalf, he was ably seconded by his Lt. Colonel, John R. Lane, who manifested extraordinary abilities as a drill master and disciplinarian. \"This perfection of drill, to which the excellent music of Captain Mickey's band greatly added, was a cause of just pride to every member of the regiment, officers and men alike. Never was any man prouder of his regiment, and of his band, considered the finest in the army of Northern Virginia, than Colonel Burgwyn,\" writes a member of the regiment.\n\nRAWLS MILLS, NOVEMBER 2, 1862.\n\nThe first opportunity afforded the 26th NC Regiment to show of what stuff it was made, acting in an independent command, occurred in the engagement at Rawls's Mills, in Martin County, NC, in resisting Federal Maj. Gen. John G. Foster's attempt to capture the regiment while on a reconnoissance in the neighborhood of Washington in Beaufort County.\n\nIn his report of the expedition, Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, commanding the Federal troops in North Carolina, with headquarters at New Bern, says he set out on October 31, 1862, from New Bern to capture the three regiments (17th, 26th, and 59th NC Regiments) foraging through the Eastern counties of the State. He took three (3) brigades, 21 pieces of artillery, and cavalry, with ample wagon train, a total of 5,000 men.\n\nOn November 2, 1862, Maj. Gen. Foster left Washington for Williamston. On the same evening he encountered the 26th NC Regiment at Little Creek. He says: \"I ordered Colonel Stevenson, commanding Second Brigade, to drive them away. The engagement lasted one hour, when the enemy being driven from their rifle pits by the effective fire of Belger's Rhode Island Battery retired to Rawls's Mills. One mile further on, where they made another stand in a recently constructed field work, Belger's Battery and two batteries of the Third New York artillery, after half an hour, succeeded in driving the enemy from their works, and across the bridge, which they burned. We bivouacked on the field, and next day proceeded to Williamston.\"\n\nThe only Confederate troops to oppose these 5,000 of Maj. Gen. Foster were six (6) companies of the 26th NC Regiment, under Col. Henry K. Burgwyn. Leaving four (4) companies under Lt. Col. John R. Lane, at Williamston, on the Roanoke River, Col. Burgwyn started out on a reconnoissance to go as far as Washington, NC. He stationed two (2) companies at Rawls's Mills, under Capt. John B. McLauchlin, of Company K, with orders to fortify the position and proceeding with the remaining four (4), reached the vicinity of Washington, NC, just as Maj. Gen. Foster was starting out to capture him.\n\nCol. Burgwyn had no cavalry or artillery. There were two parallel roads leading out of Washington for Williamston. Again, it was necessary to delay the Federal advance as much as possible, to give time to Col. Dennis D. Ferrebee, of the 59th NC Regiment (Fourth Cavalry) and Lt. Col. John C. Lamb, in command of the 17th NC Regiment, who were in the neighborhood of Plymouth, to retrace their steps. Dispatching a messenger to Col. Ferrebee and Lt. Col. Lamb, warning them of their danger, and one to Lt. Col. Lane, with an order to join him at Rawls's Mills, Col. Burgwyn determined to resist Maj. Gen. Foster's advance at that point.\n\nAs soon as it was ascertained which of the two (2) roads the enemy had selected, Col. Burgwyn chose the other and started out in the race for Rawls's Mills. On reaching the Mills, he ordered Capt. McLauchlin to go down the road on which Maj. Gen. Foster was advancing, and hold him in check at Little Creek. Capt. McLauchlin, with Companies K and I, reached Little Creek just as the enemy's cavalry began to cross, and attacked them with his handful of men.\n\nCol. Burgwyn, placing his four companies in the hastily constructed breastworks at the Mills, awaited Maj. Gen. Foster's advance. After Capt. McLauchlin had been for some time engaged with the enemy at Little Creek, successfully defending the passage of the stream against Colonel Stevenson's brigade with cavalry and artillery, Col. Burgwyn sent Companies D and F, under command of Maj. John T. Jones, to Capt. McLauchlin's support. Fearing that a longer resistance by so small a force would result in its capture, Col. Burgwyn, after the fight had lasted over an hour, ordered Capt. McLauchlin to join him at the Mills. Here, Maj. Gen. Foster brought into action three (3) batteries of artillery against the six (6) companies at the Mills, and succeeded, \"according to the General's report,\" after half an hour, in driving the enemy from his works, and across the bridge, which they burned. The fact was, Col. Burgwyn, having received advices that Col. Ferrebee and Lt. Col. Lamb were safe, and Lt. Col. Lane having joined him from Williamston, concluded to retire in the night, so as not to disclose the paucity of his force, and at his leisure fell back in the direction of Tarborough, first burning the bridge at the Mill. Capt. McLauchlin lost one (1) killed, and three (3) wounded. General Foster's report admits a loss of six (6) killed and eight (8) wounded.\n\nAfter proceeding to within ten (10) miles of Tarborough, \"owing to the exposed condition of his men and want of provisions,\" says Maj. Gen. Foster, he abandoned any further advance, and counter-marched to Washington, and thence to New Bern.\n\nIt was a singular coincidence that the Federal General (Foster) had been the tutor of his youthful antagonist (Burgwyn), when the latter was a student at West Point in 1856, awaiting appointment in that institution, at which Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, then Captain Foster, was one of the professors. The art of war as taught by the professor was in this instance applied to his discomfiture by the pupil.\n\nFOSTER'S EXPEDITION AGAINST GOLDSBOROUGH.\n\nIn December of 1862, Maj. Gen. Foster started out from New Bern to destroy the railroad bridge over the Neuse River, and capture Goldsborough, NC. Maj. Gen. Samuel G. French (MS), who was in command of the Department of North Carolina, under Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith (VA), commanding at Richmond, assembled his forces to oppose him. On December 17, 1862, a spirited engagement took place near Goldsborough, in which Maj. Gen. Foster was driven back, and he hastily retreated to New Bern. Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's brigade was not seriously engaged in this action, but pursued Maj. Gen. Foster on the latter's retreat.\n\nMAJOR GENERAL D. H. HILL'S ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE NEW BERN.\n\nOn February 7, 1863, Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith resigned and Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC) was again placed in command of the troops in North Carolina. Maj. Gen. Hill resolved on the capture of New Bern. Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew (NC) was given command of the troops on the north side of the Neuse River, and Maj. Gen. Hill had charge of those to operate on the south side.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pettigrew with his brigade, started from Goldsborough on March 9, 1863. By rapid marches he reached the enemy's works at Barrington's Ferry, near New Bern. The 26th Regiment was ordered at daylight into position to carry the place. Three (3) 20-pound Parrott guns relied upon to destroy the gunboats guarding the water approaches to New Bern, proved utterly worthless. One burst, the ammunition was defective, and their fire proved more injurious to the Confederates than to the enemy. There was nothing to do but to withdraw.\n\n\"The only question,\" says Brig. Gen. Pettigrew in his report, \"was whether I should carry the works before withdrawing. The Twenty-sixth Regiment had been in waiting ever since daylight, and would have done it in five minutes. The works we could not hold. There would be a probable loss of a certain number of men sixty miles from a hospital. I decided against it. It cost me a struggle after so much labor and endurance to give up the eclat, but I felt that my duty to my country required me to save my men for some operation in which sacrifice would be followed by consequences. I therefore withdrew the whole command except the Twenty-sixth Regiment, which remained within about 500 yards of the place, in order to cover the withdrawal of Captain Whitford's men. I cannot refrain from bearing testimony to the unsurpassed military good conduct of those under me. In seven days they marched 127 miles; waded swamps, worked in them by night and day, bivouaced in the rain, sometimes without fire, never enjoyed a full night's rest after the first, besides undergoing a furious shelling, and discharging other duties. All this without murmuring or even getting sick.\"\n\nIt was not long before Brig. Gen. Pettigrew had another chance at the enemy, in which he was more fortunate. Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill (NC), with all his available forces, on March 30, 1863, invested Maj. Gen. John G. Foster in Washington, NC. On April 9, 1863, at Blount's Creek, Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's brigade met and defeated Brig. Gen. Francis B. Spinola in the latter's attempt to raise the siege. Finding it impossible to capture the place after the enemy's gunboats had succeeded in passing the batteries at Rodman's Point, and thus reinforcing Maj. Gen. Foster, after fourteen (14) days investment, Maj. Gen. Daniel H. Hill withdrew, having failed in this attempt to re-capture the town.\n\nMAJOR GENERAL HENRY HETH'S DIVISION.\n\nOn May 1, 1863, Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade was ordered to Richmond to be ever thereafter attached to the Army of Northern Virginia. Taking position first at Hanover Junction, to protect that important point in the enemy's attempts to capture Richmond, the brigade, leaving the 44th NC Regiment behind at the junction, as a guard, proceeded to Fredericksburg, and now attached to Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's (VA) Division, set out on June 15th on the memorable march to invade Pennsylvania.\n\nMaj. Gen. Heth's Division, as then organized, was composed of Brig. Gen. James J. Archer's Tennessee, Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis's Mississippi, Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginia, and Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigades.\n\nThe division commander was a native of Virginia, a graduate of West Point, had served with distinction in the war with Mexico, and against the Indians on the frontier, and had resigned from the United States Army to accept service under his native State. Promoted from Colonel of the 45th VA Regiment to the command of a Virginia Brigade, he won additional promotion by his services in the Chancellorsville campaign (Spring of 1863), and was now at the head of a command ever to bear his name and to serve under him until he, with its shattered remnants, surrendered at Appomattox. \"His earnest praise of the great qualities of his North Carolina soldiers was unstinted. Even to the last, there was a peculiar tension and quiver of the mouth when he would speak of their almost God-like heroism at Gettysburg, and the unheard of, and never equalled, slaughter that checked, but never terrified them.\"\n\nMARCH TO GETTYSBURG.\n\nSays a member of the regiment: \"What a fine appearance the regiment, made as it marched out from its bivouac near Fredericksburg that beautiful June morning. The men beaming in their splendid uniforms; the colors flying, and the drums beating; everything seemed propitious of success. On this march it was a real pleasure to see with what joy the people who had hitherto been under the domination of the Federals, received us. We marched by way of Harper's Ferry, where the gallows on which the notorious John Brown was hanged, was pointed out to us. Our Colonel was one of the cadets at the Virginia Military Institute at the time, and one of those who had guarded John Brown while awaiting his execution.\n\nWe crossed the Potomac River at Shepherdstown and continued our march and rested beyond the little town of Fayetteville, PA, on Sunday, June 28, 1863. At this place the Chaplains held services.\n\nAlas, the last Sunday on earth to many a noble soul then beating with such high hopes and aspirations. At this place some of the men of our brigade robbed a farmer of a few of his bee hives. This was regretted, for strict orders had been given that on this great march into the enemy's country, nothing should be taken except such provisions as the commissaries might require to be issued as rations and for which they were willing to pay. It being suggested that some of the men of the 26th NC Regiment got some of the honey, Col. Henry K. Burgwyn and Lt. Col. John R. Lane sought out the owner and paid him for it. The farmers along our line of march were quietly reaping and housing their grain. They did not seem to be in the least frightened or dismayed by our presence, and were left by us in the quiet and undisturbed possession of their crops.\n\nOn June 30th, we halted at a little village named Cashtown, on the Chambersburg Turnpike, about nine (9) miles from Gettysburg, and were mustered preparatory to payment, and later in the afternoon proceeded to within about three and one-half miles of Gettysburg, just this side of a little creek, crossed by a stone bridge, where we filed to the right and bivouacked in a beautiful grove. That night Lt. Col. Lane was entrusted with the charge of the picket lines. After the establishment of the line, two (2) ladies, much distressed and alarmed, because they were cut off from their houses, approached Lt. Col. Lane who, assuring them that the Confederate soldier did not make war upon women and children, but ever esteemed it his duty and privilege to protect them, advanced the picket line beyond their homes, which lay closeby.\n\nThe same day Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew (NC), with three (3) regiments of his brigade, kept on to Gettysburg to procure shoes and other army supplies for his men; but meeting a strong force of the enemy's cavalry (two brigades of Maj. Gen. John Buford's Division), and instructed not to bring on an engagement, Brig. Gen. Pettigrew retraced his steps and rejoined the rest of the division in bivouac on the Chambersburg Turnpike, about three and a half miles distant from the village of Gettysburg. That night the men of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's (VA) Division quietly dreamed of home and loved ones in blissful ignorance of the momentous fact that Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's great army was almost within their hearing.\n\nGETTYSBURG. 1-3 JULY, 1863.\n\nA warning carbine shot from a vidette of Maj. Gen. John Buford's Cavalry Division on the bridge over Marsh Creek, fired in the early misty morn at the head of a column of infantry marching rapidly down the Chambersburg Turnpike, was the opening of the battle of Gettysburg. This infantry column was the head of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's (VA) Division, marching to \"feel the enemy\" of whose presence the skirmish of the afternoon before, had apprised them. At once the leading brigade (Brig. Gen. James J. Archer's) was filed to the right, formed in line of battle, its left resting on the turnpike and advanced to the front. Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis' (MS) brigade, forming in a similar manner on the left of the turnpike, with its right resting on the turnpike, also advanced. Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) and Col. Brockenbrough's Brigades, for the present, were held in reserve. Says a member of the 26th NC Regiment: \"As the head of the Twenty-sixth Regiment reaches the summit of the hill beyond the bridge crossing Marsh Creek, the enemy opens fire, sweeping the road with their artillery. There is some little excitement, but it soon disappears as Colonel Burgwyn riding along the line in his grandest style, commands in his clear, firm voice, 'Steady boys, steady.' ''\n\nThe regiment filed off to the right about a hundred yards, when Brig. Gen. Pettigrew and staff appeared on the field. He was mounted on his beautiful dappled gray. Never before had he appeared to greater advantage. His command was \"echelon by battalion, the 26th NC Regiment by the left flank.\" Col. Burgwyn gave his regiment the command, \"March!\" Then, as each regiment of the brigade marching to the right, uncovered the regiment in its front, its commander gave the order \"By the left flank, March,\" and thus in a few moments, and by the quickest tactical movement the brigade was in line of battle, marching to the front in the following order from left to right, 26th NC Regiment, 11th NC Regiment, 47th NC Regiment, and 52nd NC Regiment, each under the command of its respective Colonel. Advancing in line of battle, the brigade was halted to await orders. Let us turn now to see what the Federals were doing.\n\nOn the night of June 30, 1863, Maj. Gen. John Buford, in command of the advance division of cavalry of the Federal army, bivouacked his division on the western side of McPherson's Ridge, which slopes down by a gentle descent to Willoughby's Run at the bottom. This ridge ran north and south, and about 400 yards to the west of the Seminary, which is about one-quarter of a mile to the west of Gettysburg. About 11 a.m. on June 30th, Maj. Gen. Buford had entered Gettysburg by the Emmetsburg Road, just as the head of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) brigade was coming up on the Chambersburg Turnpike, and as heretofore stated, there was a skirmish, and Brig. Gen. Pettigrew withdrew, not wishing to bring on an engagement. At 10:30 that night, Maj. Gen. Buford telegraphed Maj. Gen. George G. Meade \"he is satisfied that A. P Hill's Corps is massed just back of Cashtown.\" As Brig. Gen. James J. Archer's (TX) Brigade advanced, it met Maj. Gen. Buford's pickets stretching along Willoughby's Run. Driving them in and rapidly advancing across the run, he struck Maj. Gen. Buford's main lineBrig. Gen. William Gamble's Brigade composed of the 8th New York, 8th Illinois, two squadrons of the 12th Illinois, three squadrons of the 3rd Indiana Cavalry and Calif's Horse Artillery of six (6) 3-inch rifle guns, now dismounted and acting as infantry, and posted along McPherson's Ridge and in McPherson's woods. These troops Brig. Gen. Archer was steadily driving back up the slope, when he suddenly found himself enveloped between the extended lines of Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith's (Iron) Brigade, of Brig. Gen. James S. Wadsworth's Division of the First Army Corps just arrived on the scene at double quick. Federal Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday in his report of the battle of Gettysburg, thus describes this action:\n\n''The enemy (Archer's Brigade) were already in the woods and advancing at double quick to seize this central important position (McPherson's woods). The Iron Brigade led by the Second Wisconsin, in line followed by the other regiments, deployed en echelon, and without a moment's hesitation charged with the utmost steadiness and fury and hurled the enemy back into the run, and captured, after a sharp and desperate conflict, nearly one thousand prisoners, including General Archer. (General Heth places the number captured at 60 or 70.) General Archer was captured by Private Patrick Maloney, Company G, of the Second Wisconsin. Maloney was subsequently killed.'' \"On the left,\" says General Heth, \"Davis' Brigade advanced driving the enemy and capturing his batteries, but was unable to hold the position, the enemy concentrating on his front and flank an overwhelming force. The Brigade held its position until every field officer save two was shot down.\" By reference to General Wadsworth's report, it is seen that it was Cutler's Brigade, assisted by Second Maine Battery that was attacked by Davis' Brigade. General Wadsworth says: \"The right became sharply engaged before the line was formed. At this time, 10:15 a.m., our gallant leader (General John F. Reynolds, commanding the First Corps, Army of the Potomac) fell mortally wounded. The regiments encountered heavy force, were outnumbered, outranked and after a resolute contest, fell back in good order to Seminary Ridge near town. As they fell back, followed by the enemy, the Fourteenth New York State Militia, Sixth Wisconsin and Ninety-fifth New York Volunteers, gallantly charged on the advancing enemy and captured a large number of prisoners, including two entire regiments with their flags.\" Lieutenant Colonel Rufus R. Dawes, commanding the Sixth Wisconsin, says in his report: \"Major John A. Blair, commanding the Second Mississippi Volunteers, upon my demand, surrendered his sword and regiment to me, 7 officers and 225 men.\"\n\nFrom this severe round, to use a pugilist's expression, both sides took a breathing spell and reformed to renew the attack. Says Maj. Gen. Henry Heth: \"The enemy had now been felt and the division now was formed in line of battle on the right of the road as follows. Archer's, now commanded by Colonel B. D. Fry, of the Thirteenth Alabama, on the right; Pettigrew in the centre, and Brockenbrough on the left. Davis' Brigade was kept on the left of the road to collect its stragglers; from its shattered condition it was not deemed advisable to bring it into action again on that day. It did, however, participate later in the action. After resting in line for an hour or more, orders came to attack the enemy in my front with the notification that Pender's Division would support me.\"\n\nLet us glance a moment at the character, numbers and position of the enemy which Maj. Gen. Heth was now to assault with his two (2) sound and one (1) crippled brigade, and make, considering the fierceness with which it was made, the obstinacy with which it was met and the fearful loss in killed and wounded sustained on both sides, the most notable charge in all the battles of the war between the States.\n\nA recent writer, John M. Vanderslice, author of a work called \"Gettysburg. Then and Now,\" a gallant Union soldier, places the relative positions of the opposing forces at 11 a.m., on July 1, 1863, as follows: Maj. Gen. Heth's division occupied the extreme right, with Brig. Gen. James J. Archer's (TX) Brigade on the right; next Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC), then Col. John M. Brockenbrough's (VA), then Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis' (MS). Facing these Confederate troops, there was Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith's Iron Brigade, occupying McPherson's woods. On the left of the woods was placed Col. Chapman Biddle's Brigade and on the right of the woods was Col. Roy Stone's Brigade. The One Hundred and Fifty-first Pennsylvania Regiment of Col. Biddle's Brigade was in reserve, so there were three (3) regiments of that Brigade with Capt. James H. Cooper's Battery in the action at the beginning. These several brigades were organized as follows:\n\nBrig. Gen. Meredith's Iron Brigade, 19th Indiana, 24th Michigan, 2nd, 6th, and 7th Wisconsin Regiments.\n\nCol. Chapman Biddle's Brigade, 80th NY, 121st, 142nd, and 151st PA Regiments. (Chapman was leading Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley's Brigade.)\n\nCol. Roy Stone's Brigade, 143rd, 149th, and 150th PA Regiments.\n\nThese regiments in these brigades were posted as follows:\n\nCounting from left to right. Col. Biddle's extreme left regiment: 121st PA. Next on right 80th NY, then Cooper's Battery, then 142nd PA. Brig. Gen. Meredith's Iron Brigade, extreme left regiment the 19th Indiana, next the 24th Michigan, next the 7th Wisconsin, and on the extreme right the 2nd Wisconsin. The 6th Wisconsin was in reserve. Col. Stone's Brigade was not engaged with any of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's men, but confronted the remnants of Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis' Brigade and the 47th and 55th Virginia Regiments of Col. John M. Brockenbrough's. Brig. Gen. James J. Archer's Brigade on the Confederate extreme right overlapped Col. Biddle's Brigade on the Federal extreme left, but Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's Brigade of four (4) regiments, being in full ranks, and Col. Biddle's three (3) regiments not large, the two (2) left regiments of Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's lapped over and confronted the left of the Iron Brigade, bringing the 26th NC Regiment with its 800 muskets in front of the 19th Indiana and the 24h Michigan, numbering together 784, rank and file.\n\nThe position of the Iron Brigade in McPherson's woods was not a straight line; the 19th Indiana and 24th Michigan formed nearly a straight line parallel with Willoughby Run, but its next regiment, the 7th Wisconsin, on the right of the 24th Michigan, was formed obliquely to the rear to confront an enemy attacking from its right flank, and also so as not to get outside of the protection of the woods, which Federal Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday says in his report \"possessed all the advantages of a redoubt.\" Then on the right of the 7th Wisconsin, the 2nd Wisconsin was formed connecting with the left of Col. Stone's Brigade. Thus it appears the 26th NC Regiment faced the front of the Iron Brigade, which consisted of the two (2) regiments, the 19th Indiana and the 24th Michigan, but the Confederate troops charging these two (2) regiments in the woods were subjected to the fire from the men of Col. Biddle's Brigade and of Capt. Cooper's battery on their right; and it was from the fire of this battery, one of the best batteries of the Federal forces, that the 26th NC Regiment suffered severely, especially while charging across Willoughby Run, and reforming thereafter.\n\nThe situation then at 2 o'clock p.m., on July 1, 1863, is this: The Iron Brigade in line of battle in McPherson's woods is waiting the assault of Brig. Gen. Pettigrew's brigade, with the 26th NC Regiment of said brigade directly in their front, separated by Willoughby Run and a distance of about 300 yards.\n\nThe regiments of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade were in line by echelon, the 26th NC Regiment being in the advance and the 11th NC Regiment on its right some distance in the rear; the 47th NC Regiment in rear of the 11th, and the 52nd NC Regiment in rear of the 47th. This made the Confederate troops appear to the enemy's vision, as in several lines of battle, whereas there was only one line of battle, and as the fight progressed, these regiments came up successively and formed one (1) single line in the attack. They had, however, as their support Maj. Gen. William D. Pender's (NC) division, some distance in the rear.\n\nTHE IRON BRIGADE.ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.\n\nThe author of the History of the 24th Michigan Regiment of this Brigade, thus accounts for its name and gives its record. Its cognomen, \"Iron Brigade,\" was given them by Maj. Gen. George G. McClellan for intrepidity in the battle of South Mountain, on September 14, 1862. In proportion to its numbers it sustained the heaviest loss of any brigade in the Union Army. Its loss at Gettysburg, first day's fight, was 1,153 out of 1,883 engaged, or 61 percent. The 2nd Wisconsin sustained the greatest percentage of loss in killed and wounded of all the 2,000 regiments in the Union Army. Its loss at Gettysburg was 77 percent, of those engaged.\n\nThe 6th Wisconsin had a total loss of 867 killed and wounded during the war, and the officer in command of the 2nd MS Regiment of Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis' Brigade with 232 of his regiment and its colors, surrendered to this regiment in the early part of the first day's fight. The 7th Wisconsin met with the greatest loss of any regiment in the Union army at the battles of the Wilderness, and had 1,016 men killed and wounded during the war. The 19th Indiana in its first battle at Manassas, sustained a loss of 61 percent, 259 out of 423 engaged, and the 24th Michigan sustained the greatest loss of any regiment in the Union Army at Gettysburg, 80 percent, viz. 397 out of 496.\n\nMCPHERSON'S WOODS.\n\nFederal Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday says:\n\n\"On the most westerly of these ridges (McPherson's) General Reynolds had directed his line to be formed. A small piece of woods (in the shape of a rectangular parallelogram) cut the line of battle in about two equal parts. These woods possessed all the advantage of a redoubt strengthening the center of the line and enfilading the enemy's columns should they advance in the open spaces on either side. I deemed the extremity of the woods which extended to the summit of the ridge, to be the key of the position, and urged that portion of Meredith's (Iron) Brigadethe western men assigned to its defenseto hold it to the last extremity. Full of the memory of their past achievements, they replied cheerfully and proudly: 'If we can't hold it, where will you find the men who can?\"\n\nMaj. John T. Jones, of the 26th NC Regiment, who commanded Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's Brigade after the third day's fight, and made the official report for the brigade, dated August 9, 1863, thus describes the field:\n\n\"In our front was a wheat field about a fourth of a mile wide, then came a branch (Willoughby Run) with thick underbrush and briers skirting the banks. Beyond this again was an open field with the exception of a wooded hill (McPherson's woods) directly in front of the Twenty-sixth Regiment, and about covering its front. Skirmishers being thrown out, we remained in line of battle until 2 p.m., when orders to advance were given.\"\n\nTHE CHARGE.\n\nThe 26th NC Regiment was the extreme left regiment of Brig. Gen. James J. Pettigrew's (NC) Brigade. It directly faced McPherson's woods and its front about covered the width of the woods. The Iron Brigade occupied these woods; the open space on the left of the woods (Confederate right) was defended by Col. Biddle's Pennsylvania Brigade of four (4) regiments with Capt. Cooper's Battery in the center, the open space on the right of the woods (Confederate left) was defended by Col. Stone's Pennsylvania Brigade with three (3) regiments. Lt. James Stewart's Battery B, 4th United States Artillery, was attached to the Iron Brigade, and was posted on the right and rear supporting Col. Stone's Brigade, but in a position to sweep any part of the field. A Northern writer says: \"There is no doubt, more men fell at Stewart's guns than in any other battery in the Union armies.\" Company F of the 26th NC Regiment, was on the left of the colors. Company E was on the right, and Companies A and G were near the center. The position of these companies nearest the flag accounts for their disproportionate losses in the battle.\n\nA member of the 26th NC Regiment thus describes the situation: \"While we were still lying down impatiently waiting to begin the engagement, the right of the regiment was greatly annoyed by some sharpshooters stationed on th"
