        "text": "Augustus L.P. Vairin Diary, 2nd Miss. Infantry Civil War Diary\n\nof\n\nAugustus L. P. Vairin\n\n2nd Mississippi Infantry, C.S.A.\n\nEdited by Andrew Brown\n\nPicture of Augustus Vairin taken from\n\nHistory Of Tippah County, Mississippi\n\nby Andrew Brown\n\nThe life of the author of \"Old Ord's War Journal\" was from its beginning an eventful one. His father and mother married when quite young and immediately moved to the south, probably to Louisiana, where in the summer of 1819 the father fell victim to yellow fever. That same winter the young wife started to return north, but the steamboat on which she was travelling became locked in the ice of the Ohio River near Smithland, Kentucky, where, on December 12, 1819, her only child, Augustus Louis Paul Vairin, was born. The ice jam in the river was not broken until February 1820; and the hardship of her experience made the mother an easy victim of a severe cold which terminated in tuberculosis, of which she died two years later. The boy was cared for by his maternal grandmother until he was seven years old; he was then taken by his father's brother, a resident of Louisiana, and reared as one of his own family.\n\nLittle is known of young Vairin's early life in Louisiana. His uncle and foster father gave him a good education; judging from his knowledge of and interest in military matters, he must have attended a military school. He also learned the watchmaker's trade and at an unknown date, but probably about 1850, he moved to Holly Springs, Mississippi, the largest town in the northeastern part of that State. There he was employed as watchmaker and jeweler by the mercantile firm of Johnson and Cary until about 1855, when he removed thirty-eight miles east to the smaller town of Ripley, the county seat of Tippah County, where he opened a watchmaker's shop of his own. His first store was on the west side of the courthouse square; this was destroyed by fire on February 6, 1856, and he moved to the south side of the square where he remained about two years. In January 1858 he purchased a lot on Ripley's Main Street, just south of the square, to which he moved his store. About the time of the move Vairin, who always was a consistent advertiser in the local newspaper, announced himself as an \"ambrotypist\" as well as a watchmaker and jeweler.\n\nNothing is known of Vairin's part in the militia organizations of Tippah County beyond the fact that his name is not included in any of the extant lists of officers. In late 1859 or early 1860, however, after the John Brown raid on Harpers Ferry brought about a great growth of volunteer military companies in the Southern states, Vairin enlisted in the O'Conner Rifles of Ripley and was chosen its First Sergeant. It is not amiss to mention here that in the volunteer companies, as in the militia, the First Sergeant more likely than not was known as the Orderly Sergeant, though purists correctly point out that the two ranks are not the same. Thus it was that First Sergeant Vairin was known as Orderly Sergeant Vairin and, as time went on, merely as \" Old Ord\", the adjective referring to his age - Vairin was forty-two years old when the War Between the States began, as against an average age of about twenty-five for the men in his company.\n\nIn May 1861 the O'Conner Rifles became Company B, Second Mississippi Infantry and were sent immediately to Virginia, where they served until Appomattox. Vairin retained his rank as First Sergeant until the reorganization of 1862, when he made an unsuccessful campaign to be elected Major of the regiment. Shortly thereafter he was detailed as \"instructor and drillmaster\" to the newly formed Company L, a group that on the basis of all information available, including Vairin's, must have been about the rawest bunch of raw recruits in the Army of Northern Virginia. With this company Vairin participated in the battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days' Battles, and was on his way to Manassas when he was hospitalized at Richmond and thus missed the second Manassas and Sharpsburg campaigns. While in the hospital he attempted without success to obtain a position as drillmaster in one of the camps of instruction in Mississippi. He returned to the regiment in the fall of 1862 and soon afterward transferred from Company L to his original outfit, Company B - this time as a private. There he remained until the end of the war.\n\nThe Second Mississippi, as part of Davis' Brigade, was engaged in the first fighting at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, and most of it was surrendered by Major Blair in the railroad cut north of the Cashtown road. Among those who escaped was Vairin, whose statement, in the Journal, that he cautioned the men to get out is confirmed by survivors of the battle. About sixty men of the regiment - all that was left after the affair in the railroad cut - took part in Pickett's charge on July 3, in which Vairin was wounded and captured. He was paroled in October and exchanged in January 1864, rejoining the regiment in August 1864. At that time he was still suffering from his wound and being considered unable to do active duty, was detailed in November to guard forage near Belfield, Va. He remained on fatigue duty until the fighting was over, and never rejoined the regiment.\n\nWhen he returned to his home in Ripley he found that his business, like all others in the town, had been wrecked during the guerrilla fighting that was a constant scourge in north Mississippi from 1862 to 1865. Records of the period are scant, but Vairin probably reopened his shop at the same location on south Main Street. In 1869 he was one of three commissioners appointed by the county to superintend the rebuilding of the courthouse, and he probably wrote the specifications for the building now in the Tippah County records. He also prepared the first official plat of the town of Ripley, a most careful and accurate survey on which all subsequent plats of the town are based.\n\nOn May 22, 1873, Vairin sold his store building at Ripley and that same summer moved to Owensboro, Kentucky, where he spent the remainder of his life. He never married, and in Owensboro made his home with three unmarried cousins, the daughters of his foster-father. In Owensboro he worked at his trade of watchmaker, and at odd times invented various acticles; one of these was a wheel barrow that proved very successful, though Vairin never realized any profit from it. He was active in the organizations of Confederate veterans, and maintained a correspondence with his comrades of the O'Conner Rifles, one of whom is responsible for the preservation of his War Journal. In May 1890 his health began to fail, and in November of that year he died rather suddenly. He was buried in Owensboro and, in accordance with his often repeated request, members of the veteran's organizations, appearing in full uniform, had charge of the services. Some years later his remains, with those of the cousins with whom he had lived, were moved to Metairie Cemetery at New Orleans, where they now rest.\n\nThroughout most of the war, Vairin kept a detailed diary, and assured its preservation by sending each volume, as soon as it was finished, to Orlando Davis, a friend at Ripley. After the war he retrieved the diaries, and took them with him when he moved to Owensboro. In 1886 Dr. E. Newton Hunt, then a prominent physician of Ripley, asked for the diaries, apparently with the idea of compiling a company or regimental history. Vairin did not send Dr. Hunt the originals, but copied what he considered the pertinent parts in pencil on sheets of tablet paper, bound the volume, and sent it \"with best wishes for the success of your undertaking.\" Dr. Hunt's plans, whatever they were, fell through; and after his death the Journal was presented, in 1906, to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History by his widow, Mrs. Lizzie M. Hunt.\n\nThe Journal is largely an abridged, factual record - one which makes it possible, for example, to trace the movements of the Second Mississippi from 1861 to 1865 in great detail. Its author expresses few opinions; but such opinions as he does give, based as they are on reason rather than emotion, are of real value. Except for his rather obvious dislike of John Blair, who defeated him for the Majority in 1862, he does not let his feelings intrude on his story. Yet he gives us excellent characterizations of many of the characters in his drama - Colonel Falkner, that remanticist straight from the pages of Sir Walter Scott, who would make a speech (and a good one) at the slightest provocation, and who marched his men to church services in elaborate formation and had them stand under arms throughout the sermon; Colonel Stone, a hard-headed, hard-fighting soldier; Tom Nance, the private who long before he was mortally wounded at Gettysburg had figured in one of the myriad versions of the \"Here's your mule\" story; Quartermaster Sergeant Guyton, who forgot and recovered - the password at Harpers Ferry, and who mistook the beating of drums for cannon fire at Winchester; and there are many others. Somewhat surprisingly, he has little to say about Captain John H. Buchanan of Company B, a man who was held in the highest esteem by members of the company; possibly Vairin did not exactly appreciate that detail to Company L.\n\nThe Journal, abbreviated as it is, gives a deep insight into Vairin's own character. We come to know a man of wide interests, one who thought in exact terms, one who could do things with his hands, one who was willing and able to act as a trouble-shooter for the regiment. He, who had known the flat lands of Louisiana and the sandy hills of Mississippi, was impressed tremendously by the beauty of the Virginia mountains; yet at the same time his practical mind pointed out that the hard rocky roads were hard on the feet of marching soldiers. He learned to make \"coffee\" from peanuts, and built a brick oven to bake bread - this at a time and in a place where most soldiers baked their bread, when they had any bread to bake, on sticks over an open fire. He was tolerant toward the antics of \"the boys\", many of whom were not half his age, and most of whom probably regarded him as an old man indeed. Unquestionably he thought that he had not received the best of treatment from the company and the regiment, but only occasionally does bitterness creep into his journal. He continued to do his duty as he saw it, whether that duty were drilling recruits or helping make out muster and payrolls for any harried adjutant or clerk who needed assistance. If perhaps some of his statements about \"duty to our cause\" seem to modern ears a little stuffy, it is well to remember that Vairin was not preaching; he was merely talking as men talked at that time, and he meant what he said. To sum it all up, Augustus L. P. Vairin was a good soldier.\n\n\"Old Ord's War Journal\" is written in a clear, legible hand, and is here reproduced exactly as he wrote it except for the punctuation. In the manuscript small \"x's\" are used to denote punctuation of any kind; these have been changed by the editor to the accepted forms. The reader will notice that errors in grammar and spelling are few and far between, though not unnaturally Vairin had some trouble with the spelling of proper names. Variances in that respect are pointed out in the notes, except for a few names about which there can be no mistake as to the correct identity. Among the misspellings not mentioned in the notes are \"Greenville\" for \"Greeneville\", Tennessee; \"Strausburg\" for \"Strasburg\", Virginia; \"Charleston\" for \"Charlestown\", West Virginia; and \"Sheppardstown\" for \"Shepherdstown\", West Virginia.\n\nTHE O'CONNOR RIFLES\n\nThe O'Connor Rifles were organized under the provisions of a Mississippi law of 1858 which authorized the enlistment of volunteer military companies to supplement and eventually supplant the militia system, a playground which had years before demonstrated its ineffectiveness but was retained because of its political potential. Almost as soon as the law was passed four companies, all in south Mississippi, qualified under its relatively stringent terms; recruiting then lagged until John Brown's attack on Harpers Ferry fanned the martial ardor of the slave-holding states into flame almost overnight. New companies sprang into existence all over the state, and in December 1859, only two months after the Harpers Ferry affair, the Legislature appropriated $150,000 for arms and equipment, and created a \"Volunteer Military Board\" to coordinate the activities of the new organizations. About this time the O'Connor Rifles were enlisted, and when the volunteer companies were formed into two brigades in May 1860, it was placed in the First Battalion, First Regiment, First Brigade of which its captain John H. Buchanan was designated commandant. Buchanan was not promoted to Major because the Volunteer Board, unlike the rank-ridden militia, made no provision for officers of higher rank than Captain.\n\nFrom its organizations the O'Connor Rifles were armed with Mississippi Rifles, and wore gray uniforms which, if one may judge from a war-time portrait of Lieutenant Lawson B. Hovis, were designed primarily for service and were not to be mentioned in the same breath with the resplendent garb affected by such companies as, for example, the Jeff Davis Rifles of nearby Holly Springs. Strange as it may seem, the company was named for a New York lawyer, Charles O'Conor. O'Conor - so he spelled his name, though the Southerners used the more common form - was a staunch and vocal States Rights Democrat who, throughout the hectic years before 1861 not only defended slavery as a divinely ordained institution, but maintained that the Federal Government had no right to coerce any State, even though that State might go to the extremity of leaving the Union. After the war O'Conor further strengthened his ties with the South by defending Jefferson Davis against the charge of treason.\n\nMississippi seceded from the Union on January 9, 1861. Two weeks later, on January 23, the Legislature created the \"Army of Mississippi\", into which the O'Connor Rifles, mustering at that time fifty rank and file, were sworn on March 3 at Ripley. Late in April, when the Confederate Government issued its first call for Mississippi troops to serve in Virginia, the O'Connors were one of twenty or more companies that were hurried to the railroad junction at Corinth for grouping into regiments and shipment to the front. Reaching Corinth on May 1, the company on May 3 became Company B of the Second Mississippi Infantry, which was composed of troops from the four northeastern counties of the State. The other companies were the Magnolia Guards and the Joe Matthews Rifles of Tippah County; the Tishomingo Riflemen and the Iuka Rifles of Tishomingo County; the Town Creek Rifles and the Calhoun Rifles of Itawamba County; and the Pontotoc Minute Men, the Conewah Rifles, and the Cherry Creek Rifles of Pontotoc County. Regimental officers elected on May 3 were: William C. Falkner of the Magnolia Rifles, Colonel; Bentley B. Boone of the Tishomingo Riflemen, Lieutenant Colonel; and David Humphries of the O'Connor Rifles, Major. Officers of the O'Connors, now Company B, were: John H. Buchanan, Captain; Lawson B. Hovis, First Lieutenant; John N. Scally, Second Lieutenant; and Henry T. Counseille, Brevet Second Lieutenant.\n\nAnother regiment, the Eleventh, was created at Corinth at the same time the Second was formed, and was brigaded with it throughout the war. Both regiments were sent to Lynchburg, Virginia, where on May 10 they were mustered into the Provisional Army of the Confederate States. The mustering officer noted that the O'Connors were armed with rifles rather than muskets, but had no knapsacks, canteens or gun slings. These accoutrements, with uniforms, they had hoped in vain to obtain at Corinth. They had obtained there, however, tents and camp equipage, and by dint of sending two men to Memphis for gray shirts and pants for those of the men who did not have uniforms - more than half of the company - they managed to present a fairly creditable appearance.\n\nWhat manner of men were these who left their Mississippi homes to fight the battles of the Confederacy in Virginia? The answer is found in a brief description of Tippah County in 1861. The county, then more than twice as large in area as it is today, contained about 16,000 white inhabitants and 6,000 slaves. A disproportionate number of the latter were concentrated along the western edge of the county, where a plantation system similar to that of adjoining Marshall County was in effect. Most of the county, however, was hilly, suited best for small farms tilled by their owners, sometimes with the help of a few slaves. The county seat, Ripley, was near the geographical center of the county and was described by a Federal officer in 1864 as \"a rather pretty New England type little village\". In 1861 it contained about 650 inhabitants. Like the surrounding country, it contained no very rich and few extremely poor and for that reason its society lacked the stratification peculiar to many communities in the South. As the oldest volunteer military company in the county, the O'Connor Rifles\n\nhad its pick of the merchants, farmers, artisans and professional men who comprised this unspectacular, somewhat isolated, but sturdy community.\n\nThe war record of the O'Connor Rifles and the Second Mississippi is well told in Vairin's Journal and will not be outlined here except to emphasize their experience in the Gettysburg campaign, which are told best in the stark account of the muster roll for July and August, 1863.\n\n\"The company went into action at Gettysburg, Pa., July 1, 1863, with an aggregate of 66 men. 1st Lieut. J. C. Lauderdale & Sgt. T. B. McKay & privates Boyd, Blackwell, Roberson & Winborn were killed on the field. The Capt., 2nd Lieut. & 3rd Lieut. were severely wounded & taken prisoner by the enemy. Eleven privates were severely wounded & captured by the enemy & fourteen were severely wounded & sent to the rear & nineteen more missing, supposed to be either killed or captured, making a total of killed, wounded & missing in 3 days fighting of fifty-three.\n\n\"After the battle of Gettysburg the company marched to Hagerstown, Md., arriving there July 7, 1863. Part of the company engaged the enemy in a skirmish & had 1 man wounded. Leaving Hagerstown on the night of the 13th July it marched to the neighborhood of Falling Water where the company had a severe skirmish with the enemy's cavalry. The loss of the company was one noncommissioned officer & two privates supposed to be captured.\"\n\nWhen Company B went into winter quarters near Orange Courthouse in October 1863 it had twenty men present for duty; that was essentially its maximum strength until Appomattox.\n\nDuring the winter of 1863-64 the company and regiment, in common with all the Army of Northern Virginia, had its troubles with absences without leave. A list, undated but made apparently early in 1864, names sixteen members of Company B as \"absent without leave in Mississippi.\" Several of these, it is known now, had been captured near their homes by Union cavalry. others placed a liberal interpretation on the forty- or sixty-day furloughs granted them, and drifted back to the company two, three, or six months late. Some never came back, but the records indicate the actual desertions from Company B were very few. Some of the men, among them Corporal V. A. Grace, simply changed commands on their own initiative. While at home on a \"wounded furlough\" Grave was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Seventh Mississippi Cavalry, and served with distinction in that organization while being carried by the Second Mississippi as absent without leave.\n\nIt is not possible at this time to compile a complete and accurate roster of the O'Connor Rifles. Some of the muster rolls in the National Archives are in bad condition, some are entirely illegible. The best information, however, is that 183 officers and men served with the company during the war. Practically all of them - probably there were not a dozen exceptions - were natives of northeast Mississippi, and the great majority made their homes in Tippah County. Nor can the company's losses be determined accurately. Lists of deceased soldiers covering the years 1862, 1863, and 1864 contain the names of thirty men from the company who were killed in action or died of wounds or disease. Adding names obtained from the muster rolls of 1861 and 1865, and from other sources, a total of forty-six deaths from all causes is reached. This figure is low rather than high, but not greatly so. No attempt has been made to compile a list of men wounded or captured; the notes accompanying Vairin's Journal tell eloquently the story of the company's losses from those causes.\n\nDuring the War Between the States approximately thirty companies of infantry and cavalry were recruited from Tippah County. Of these companies five served in the Army of Northern Virginia; four in the Second Mississippi and one, the Salem Dragoons, in the Nineteenth Mississippi. Because they were the first soldiers from the county to engage in battle, because their first Colonel was a prominent fellow-citizen, and because of their distinguished record, the men of the Second Mississippi have always held a peculiar position in the affections of residents of Tippah. In this select group the O'Connor Rifles, as the oldest volunteer company in the county, recruited from its leading families, stands pre-eminent. Defeated as it was after four years of bitter fighting, it was never dishonored.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe principal sources of information on the O'Connor Rifles, later Company B of the Second Mississippi Infantry, are the service records of members of the company in the Old Records Section of the Adjutant-General's office, and the muster rolls of the company, in the National Archives. Additional data has been supplied by present and former residents of Tippah County, especially Honorable Thomas E. Pegram, Mr. Walter J. Hovis, Mrs. Joseph Brown, and Mr. William Anderson of Ripley, Mississippi; Mr. Will Ticer and Mrs. W. B. Ivy of New Albany, Mississippi; and Mr. Merrill Wallace of Riverside, California. All of these persons are familiar with the early history of Tippah County, and their assistance is gratefully acknowledged. Information on A. L. P. Vairin's career before and after the war was found in the Deed Records and the Minutes of the Board of Police of Tippah County, and in files of the Ripley Advertiser from 1855 to 1860, in the Department of Archives and History, Jackson, Mississippi, and in the Library of Congress. For additional items the writer is indebted to Mrs. Alice Vairin Westfelt, Mrs. Barkley Witherspoon and Mrs. W. B. Monroe of New Orleans, Louisiana, who supplied valuable material from the Vairin family records.\n\nFor the purpose of correlating Vairin's account of the battles and campaigns with the overall history of the war in Virginia, Rowland's Military History of Mississippi, published in the Mississippi Official and Statistical Register, 1908; (Rowland's account of the Second Mississippi in this work is drawn partly from the Vairin diary); the official Records; and Battles and Leaders of the Civil War have been consulted. The most useful, and most used publications for this purpose, however, were R. S. Henry's Story of the Confederacy and D. S. Freeman's Lee's Lieutenants, with the aid of which it was possible to tie together practically all the loose ends in the Vairin narrative.\n\nThanks are due particularly to Dr. William D. McCain, former Director of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History and now President of Mississippi Southern College, and to Miss Charlotte Capers of the Department of Archives and History, for their assistance in making the dairy available and for numerous other helpful services.\n\nAndrew Brown\n\n2nd Mississippi Regiment Infantry\n\nOld Ord's War Journal\n\n1861, 62, 63, 64, & 65\n\nCo. B (O'Connor Rifles) 2nd Miss. Volunteers from Ripley, Miss.\n\nC. S. A.\n\n1861, Apr. 30, Tuesday, day clear & bright. Pursuant to orders received several days ago for the 2nd Miss. Regt. of volunteers to assemble at Corinth, Miss. for active duty, Cos. B & F assembled on the public square at Ripley, Miss. & at 7 1/2 o'clock AM fell into line & Mrs. Judge Green1 presented the O'Connor Rifles with a beautiful silk flag & Mrs. W. R. Cole2 presented one to the Magnolia Guards. The formality of the presentations, the excitement of the occasion, & parting of friends & relatives perhaps never to meet again was ample ceremony under the circumstances & duty to our country's cause was ample excuse to dispense with demonstrations. We then took up line of march for Saulsbury. The rains of last night made the streets & road quite muddy & hard to travel especially for new soldiers. At 3 PM we reached Wolf Creek 18 miles where we stopped for camp3 & waited for the ox wagons with our tents & baggage to come up. About 6 PM commenced pitching camp, all excitement, till 10 o'clock when all hustled in sleep until 1 o'clock when some woke up & made such a noise it was impossible to sleep as reveille was sounded when we all were astir.\n\nWednesday, May 1, clear, Camp Wolf. Our first military breakfast with fun & frolick. Tents & baggage packed & loaded on ox wagons, at 5 o'clock took up line of march. Good feeling manifested by everybody at our first undertaking & hopes of our success & speedy return. 8 AM -reached a spring 1 mile from Saulsbury, stopped 1 hour for stragglers & as soon as they came up marched in grand order to Saulsbury, Tenn., where we arrived at 9 AM. None but Southern flags to be seen. News just received that the legislature of Tennessee has passed the ordinance of secession. Speeches were made by the boys & citizens. At 1 PM a Memphis & Charleston R. R.4 train arrived for us. All got on the cars in good order, reached Corinth at 5 PM, pitched camp.5 Several other companies of our regiment here besides about 1500 other Miss. soldiers. Made my first detail to draw 2 days rations & for guard duty to which most objected because they said they did not enlist to do guard duty but to fight the Yankeys. All fun & frolick.\n\nThursday, May 2, clear & pleasant day. Some of the boys don't seem to like army crackers & salt pork, hope they'll get used to it. Drilled nearly 6 hours today & must say the duties of an Orderly Sergeant is not an easy one judging from it so far. Nearly all the And Miss. Regt. here, lots of our friends & visitors here. Lots of fun among the boys, not much for me. At 12 1/2 M with D. Embry6 visited Miss McB.7 at the Gaston Institute8 & were presented with a fine bouquet of flowers by her, & c. 6 1/2 PM guard detailed & placed out. We cannot be furnished with arms & uniforms as we expected except the 50 we brought with us. All the other companies are in the same fix, nevertheless we will go on.\n\nFriday, May 3, clear & pleasant day. I was detailed to drill Capt. Beck's9 Co. D. They seem to prefer H. H. Powers10 to drill them. These men are very attentive & anxious to learn the duties of a soldier & will do to rely on. 12 12 M drew 2 days rations. Took flour instead of crackers, got full supply vinegar, salt, coffee, rice, soap & candles. Our camp is getting pretty well organized. O'Connor Rifles changed from the right to left of the rest & called Co. B.11 5 1/2 PM dress parade. W. J. (Jim) Bennet,12 & E. N. Hunt13 sent to Memphis for clothing.14\n\n2nd Regt. fully organized, W. C. Falkner,15 Col., Boone,16 Lieut. Col., David Humphreys,17 Major, J. J. Guyton,18 Quartermaster Sergeant, Dr. J. Y. Murry,19 Surgeon, Lawson Hovis,20 Adjutant. Ilth Miss. Regt. here.21\n\nSaturday, May 4, fine pleasant day. Drilled 3 hours & received marching orders. Draw & cook 3 days provisions tomorrow in time to take the cars at 12 M. Went to commissary & drew 3 days rations for 105 men. It is hard to get things quick for they are little posted on their duties in this as in other departments. 1 PM clouding up fast. 2 PM got my provisions, flour by request of the men, distributed. 3 PM raining so hard it is out of the question to cook. Most of the messes are having their bread baked by citizens as best they can. Guard detailed. Heavy rain during the night, it fell in torrents. W. J. Bennet & Hunt returned from Memphis with gray flannel shirts and pants for the O'Connors.\n\nSunday May 5, rain & stormy. Some of the companies are ankle deep in mud & water in their tents but Co. B are all dry and snug. 1 PM all baggage & tents packed & 1st Battalion of the 2nd Miss. Regt. started for Lynchburg, Va. under Lieut. Col. Boon & Major Humphreys. 2 PM, 2nd Battalion took the cars for the same place, Co. B in passenger cars & also part of Co. G, Capt. H. R. Miller.22 All the rest in flat cars & suffered from rain during the night. 8 PM reached Tuscumbia, Ala. 12 M\n\nraining in torrents. One man fell off the cars on the way out but was not hurt. Much swamp & low land along part of the way. John Blair23 made Sergeant Major.\n\nMonday May 6, rain, rain without ceasing. 8 AM reached Stevenson.24 Have to change cars & wait till 11 for our train. The officers had coffee made for all the men. Some men complain they are out of cooked rations, a hard thing to get here. John Moore25 of the Iuka company got his foot crushed by the cars. This will keep him off duty for 10 days. The sceanery here is fine, the place of little consequence except a R. R. depot. 11 AM 2 companies from New Albany26 came up bound for Richmond, Va. 1 PM crossed the Tennessee River, sceanery mountainous, magnificent. At 6 reached Chattanooga. 7 PM changed cars, freight for men & non-commissioned officers. Road bad, rough. We go on to Bristol.27\n\n7 May Tuesday, clear, cool. Rough & rugged country. The people seem glad to see us. Reached Greenville, the residence of Andy Johnson. Here we saw the first U. S. flag on the rout, all torn & tattering flaunting from the courthouse. Many Southern flags everywhere, much greeting on our arrival. Our boys got much excited about Andy Johnson & we went on to Jonesboro which is a nice place. Andy Johnson was to speak here today but the people would not let him. Secession seems to prevail here & is on the increase. Col. F.28 was called on for a speech here which called forth much applause & cheering. 8 PM reached Bristol & changed cars.\n\n8 May Wednesday. Bristol is on the Tennessee & Virginia state line, tolerably fine place. Men scarce of provisions. Most of the men continue to get coffee for breakfast, some complain of provisions. Our baggage guard had to sleep out of doors with the baggage because it could not be put on cars at night. 9 AM we started, leaving 2 New Albany companies to come on the next train. Men all well & in good spirits. The country is fine, many green pastures, trees just putting out leaf, apple trees blooming, corn planting. Much more enthusiasm among the people for the Southern cause than heretofore. 10 AM passed Abingdon, fine place, great cheering on our arrival, many beautiful residences. 12 M clearing, pleasantly warmer. Many fine streams along the rout, meadows, green pastures, wheat & c. fields & entirely land of enchantment to the view. Stopped 2 hours for down train. 5 PM a row broke out between the Iuka & Conewa29 companies which came near seriously to many, cause mostly whiskey. 5 1/2 PM Wytheville, here the people had prepared a dinner or supper for our battalion. Col. F. made a speech. 6 PM went on to Dublin, 8 PM, where the people had prepared a fine supper for all.\n\n9 May Thursday, 5 AM Liberty.30 Here we stopped 1 hour for down train. Col. F. & others made speeches here. The breaking of an Axel detained the train 5 miles out of Lynchburg where we arrived at 12 M & marched up hill all the way to Camp Walker which is a fine oak grove, where we pitched our tents. The ground is somewhat rolling. The color line is on the east & parade ground on the west in rear of the officer's tent. The 1st Battalion arrived here yesterday all safe. The sceanery from camp & its surrounding is beautiful, the country being mountainous. The water from the camp is obtained from a large spring on Mr. Johns' place about 200 yards off. Mr. J. takes much interest to accomodate us & is a very gentleman.\n\n10 May Friday, pleasant day. Drilled some today, quite a number of ladies & gents visited camp today. Co. B is the best drilled in the Regt. At 12 M the regiment was regularly mustered into the service of the Confederate States by Major Clay who seems to be a fine officer & of good deportment. Some of the boys objected somewhat to being sworn into service. 5 1/2 PM Dress Parade. Rained some during the night.\n\n11 May Saturday, pleasant. Drilled all the forenoon. I drilled the Iuka Co., Capt. Stone.31 Many visited camp. I went down to town; find it a very rough, rugged place built on craggy cliffs. Also went to the James River with others & bathed but found the water rather cold & 2 1/2 feet deep with rocky bottom. 5 1/2 PM dress parade but it was broken up by a shower of rain. Many ladies present.\n\n12 May Sunday, pleasant. Dress parade at 9 AM & had a sermon by Rev. W. A. Gray32 of Ripley while we were under arms which was a rather novel sight.33 The Adjutant reports the regt. 932 strong exclusive of the officers. The commissary department issues rations after every parade which is troublesome. Provisions all good & abundant. The bread is baker's bread.\n\n13 May Monday, 14, 15, & 16, nothing new, only usual drill camp duties.\n\nMay 17, Friday. Reveille at 4 AM, tents struck at 5, at 6 the regt. took up line of march & took the cars for Harpers Ferry. The streets were crowded to see us leave. J. T. Buchanan,34 hospital steward, detailed to stay with the sick & bring them up. No sick from Co. B, only 3 or 4 from the regt. The country is much broken & poor. 4 PM Charlottesville, fine sceanery & good farming land. 12 PM Manassas.\n\n18 May Saturday. We were detained at Manassas until 10 1/2 AM for some cause or other. The 2nd Battalion & 11th Miss. all here. Much trouble to get off.35 Some very fine farms on the road. 4 1/2 PM Strausburg, pitch tents in a clover field. From here we walk to Winchester.\n\n19 Sunday. It is reported that Genl. Scott36 has notified the commander at Harpers Ferry that he must leave there by next Thursday or he will make him do so. 7 1/2 AM took up line of march for Winchester on a good turnpike road37 which the men find very hard on their feet. The sick are put in wagons with the baggage. The country along this road is beautiful, the farms excellent. 3 1/2 PM reached Winchester, 18 miles, the regt. camped in the fair grounds. The town has 5000 inhabitants, has some fine buildings & some very old ones. Drew rations of bread & meat. I had a chill & some fever at 7 PM. Have a blister on my left foot as big as a 1/2 dollar.\n\n20 May Monday. Rained all night. 8 AM the reg. took cars for Harpers Ferry.38 As we approached it the mountain scenery is beautiful. 12 M arrived at H. F. & quartered in one of the army buildings.39 Part of the adjoining factory buildings were burned, besides storehouses, etc. by the regulars when they evacuated the place.\n\n21 Tuesday, cloudy. Sent out a camping party. Took a walk with Sergeant C. Lauderdale.40 Have to get written permission from the caption to cross the bridge over the Potomac & travel the road. Sentries are at short intervals on the Maryland side. 3 PM the regt. started to camp about 1 mile off on Bolivar Heights, tolerably good ground & near the 11th Miss. Looks like rain. 6 PM dress parade, general orders.\n\n5 AM Reveille 8 Squad drill\n\n5 1/2 Squad drill 10 1/2 Camp drill\n\n6 Surgeon's call 1 PM Dinner\n\n6 Breakfast 3 Camp drill\n\n7 1st Guard Mounting 6 Dress parade\n\n7 1/2 Guard mounting.\n\n22 May Wednesday, clear & pleasant. 12 M the rest of the 11th Miss. came to camp. It is reported that we have about 10,000 men or more at this point. This evening orders are for men to sleep on their arms - a report is out that we will be attacked in 24 hours. My opinion is that it is all a sham to call out the men to see how quick they can be formed into line. Lee Jackson41 is very sick in camp. The men are all very jolly tonight & anxious to have ammunition distributed & have their guns loaded.\n\n23 Thursday. No alarm was got up last night, nothing but regular duty. Only the sick list is on the increase.\n\n24, 25. Nothing but sickness still increases.\n\n26 Sunday. I with others went about 1 1/2 miles up the Potomac to a cave in the mountain. We went into it about 250 yards. It is generally only wide enough for one or two persons to pass at a time. The crowd was too great to see anything, in fact there was nothing to see in the dark. It was discovered by blasting the rock for the Baltimore & Ohio railroad which passes only 5 or 6 feet from it. The entrance is about 6 feet high & 6 to 7 feet wide. 250 or 300 yards before coming to the cave the R. R. passes through a tunnel 75 or 100 feet long cut into the solid rock because here the spur of the mountain runs bluff to the river. It presents a picturesque view. The river here is deeper than at the ferry because of the backwater from the dam of the Harpers Ferry Arsenal works. Between the cave & the tunnel a large crowd of us took a fine swim, returned to camp about 10 to hear Rev. W. A. Gray deliver a short sermon to the regt. Allen Smith42 is reported very sick, have no time to go see him. 5 PM went to see Lee Jackson at a house near camp. He is improving but it will be some time before he is fit for service. Sick list increasing. Co. B has 23 in hospital.\n\n27, 28, 29, & 30. Nothing but usual camp duties.\n\n31 May. 40 sick, 13 cases of measles in Co. B. We have them in a vacant house 400 yards from camp in Bolivar. They are doing well. 40 sick this morning. Camp guard dispensed with for a time.\n\n1 June. 23 men in hospital, all the other sick not bad off but not fit for duty. Only 34 men on drill today. The surgeon ordered that all the sick & unable to travel within 3 days be sent to the Winchester hospital. Lee Jackson, Fleming,43 & L. Richie44 sent up. Dr. J. G. B.45 went with them as nurse. About this time Dr. Hubbard46 of Vicksburg, Miss. was appointed Surgeon & Dr. J. Holt47 of Liberty, Miss. Asst. Surgeon of the 2nd Miss. Regt., Dr. J. Y. Murry being discharged.\n\n2 June Sunday. Rev. W. A. Gray, Chaplain of the regt. preached to the regt. Many of the men are signing a petition for Dr. Hubbard to resign, a very bad move in my opinion because situated as we are all is being done for our sick that can be done under the circumstances. Pres. Davis would not commission an incompetent man as surgeon. Am doing all I can to stop the petition for several reasons. Rumors were rife yesterday of an attack on this point, all nonsense.\n\n3 June, 20 in hospital, 20 sick in camp. Raining hard.\n\n4, 5, 6, 7, usual routine.\n\n8 Saturday, fine. Usual duty. At 6 PM orders were given to pack up & leave for some place. All tents were struck & a heavy shower of rain came up. Baggage all loaded in the wagons & at sunset took up line of march, went about 1/2 mile SW & camped in a fine grove. Got up our tents by 9 PM, all wet. Co. B had 6 loads of baggage for a 4-horse team. 12 PM camp all settled & quiet. This I believe was a foolish trick of the regimental officers & I fear will prove of little benefit to the sick. The camp is on the slope of a hill facing SE.\n\n9 June Saturday. All the able of the company were detailed for guard duty pursuant to orders that all guards should be mounted by company, thus taking every man from camp. A very bad plan as we find out this day & others will experience ere long. At 9 orders were given to change position of the camp to face it west running the streets up & down hill. 3 of us & 7 or 8 sick had to move & put up all the tents & baggage. We had to move everything. This is one of the hardest days work I ever done. Use camp slopes too much for convenience although the prospect from it is beautiful. Over 50 sick in camp & hospital, nearly all measles, none dangerously sick but A. G. Smith. Most cases convelescent & fit for duty in a week or two.\n\n10, 11, 12. Nothing but usual duties.\n\n12 June Wednesday, Thanksgiving Day.48 We are to have sermons today at 10 AM & 2 PM. 9 AM all the sick ordered to Winchester & all baggage but what 2 companies can put in 1 wagon. Much stir in camp. Sent off all the tents but 7 for the men & 1 for the officers. Many sick object to being sent off. 1 1/2 PM everything packed up & sent off except the 8 tents which it is not likely to occur untill tomorrow as Co. D & F are on guard duty. All the other regts. have the same orders as ours. The 11th Miss. camp corners with ours, the Virginia regiments south, the 4th Alabama regt. adjoining it. 2 1/2 PM 30 rounds of ammunition issued to each man. 2 Miss. will leave with about 60 men. 2 PM I went with Capts. Miller & Boothe49 to attend to getting off the sick. We found most of the men on the cars. We went into one house to find sick men, & some 80 or 90 sick from Miss. & Tenn. to be sent off by next train to Winchester. They present a distressing spectacle by the dim light of one dim candle in a room 16 feet square, were 12 to 15 men in it. Returned to camp by 9 1/2 PM. All quiet.\n\n14 June Thursday, fine day. 6 AM orders to cook breakfast & strike tents & we waited for further orders which were to march at 6 PM. At 6 AM the bridges over the Potomac were blown up & burned by order of Gen. Joe Johnston50 commanding. During the forenoon all the public buildings at H.F. & the long tresseling of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad were burned, all of which was in plain view of our camp. This was a great destruction of fine & expensive works but it was all for the best as it will not do to leave & give the enemy a chance to follow us quickly as we are encumbered with many sick, say 350 to 400 only for the 2nd Miss. & others in proportion. Our regt. this morning 531 men fit for duty in the field. Co. B 69 men out of 105. Nearly all the sick in all regts. are measles. One Virginia regt. yesterday in their hurry to get away from here crowded all the sick out of the cars to make room for themselves. We have about 8 to 10 regiments here. Our baggage is not yet up from the depot. A strong picket guard extends from the Potomac to the Shenandoah Rivers, consisting of the 2nd Georgia on the Potomac, 2nd Miss., 11th Miss., 4th Ala. The chain is 1 mile long & consists of 300 to 400 men. We sleep without tents tonight ready to fall into line at a moment. The Iuka Co. returned from picket guard, Co. G from camp guard. Some look for an attack tonight, very doubtful. Drew rations for tomorrow. The men are cooking them, all they have. No meat is or can be got today. Will not move till morning.\n\n15 June Friday. 4 AM reveille, everything done up on short order. Breakfast soon over & as we had no tents we had ample & airy rooms for the purpose. 6 1/2 AM the troops at the Ferry took up line of march, about 5 or 6,000 men in line, a grand sight. At 8 1/2 AM the 2nd Miss. formed line & being next to the last regiment to start it was full 9 o'clock before we got off. Forenoon quite warm & clear, travel very slow. Many men leave the lines & as there is little concert of action jams continually occur which prevent making more than 1/4 mile at a time. At 11 having given the main line time to get 1/2 mile ahead we pushed up as we found to our cost because it exhausted the men very much. 3 PM reached Charlestown where we were much cheered by the people. Here we got good water. 1 mile from here L. Richie having taken too much ice water he took sick & fainted & came near dying at Charlestown. He & others were put in the cars & sent to Winchester which is our point of destination. The road we travel is a turnpike, not the smoothest either as my feet can tell. Corn is 2 to 6 inches high. At 5 PM reached camp (Johnston) 4 miles from Charlestown and 20 miles to Winchester. Made 11 miles today & are to reach W. tomorrow morning. Camp finely situated with a good supply of water which is good but not very convenient, from a large spring. It looks rainy & we pitch tents.\n\n16 June Saturday. Prospect of a fair day. 4 AM reveille. At 9 took up line of march for W. but learning the enemy was at Martinsburg51 the rout was changed toward that place. This change caused much delay. We marched 15 to 18 miles & camped at Bunkerhill in a cedar thicket. Had some rain during the night but not to hurt. Provisions scarce, some grumble because they are hungry. 9 1/2 AM orders issued that all baggage but cooking utensils & 1 blanket per man be sent to Winchester.\n\n17 June Sunday, clear. Col. Falkner promoted to Brigadier General & commands the 2nd & 11th Miss., 1st Tenn. & 1 Baltimore regiment.52 All baggage being sent off by wagons but ammunition train. Much delay, 8,000 to 10,000 men are not moved in 1 minute. A band struck up music, the bass drum sounded big & Bil R.,53 Qr. master started his wagon train off at a gallop telling his teamsters that it was enemy artillery & get off fast & he did, for report has it that he drove all the way to Winchester under whip & spur. 12 M have not moved a peg yet. Enemy reported to be near Martinsburg, we are to start for that point. Day cloudy & pleasant. 1 PM took up line of march for Winchester & pitched camp 2 1/2 miles from that place.\n\n18 June Monday, Clear & pleasant, rested all day.\n\n19 June. The regt. moved to 1/4 mile from Winchester & camped on the same ground that Washington & Braddock camped on in their trip to Braddock's famous defeat. The prospect from this point is fine. The entire Shenandoah Valley is inexpressibly beautiful. Winchester is a fine town of 5000 inhabitants. From camp we can see Harpers Ferry, the Maryland & Virginia Heights, Manassas Gap & Strasburg. Our camp is on the Winchester Heights in a fine grove of timber. The whole brigade is camped together. Gen. Falkner resigned his brigadiership & is succeeded by Gen. Bee54 of South Carolina who is a fine looking officer & very highly spoken of.\n\n20, 21 & 22. Drill & usual camp duty.\n\n23 June Sunday. At 12 1/2 last night 1 man from each mess was waked up to cook bread & breakfast for a march. Reveille at usual time. ordered 1 skillet, 1 frying pan, 1 axe & 1 spade for every 8 men. Each man to carry 1 blanket, 1 shirt, 1 days rations & 40 pounds of ammunition. The camp is to remain standing as it is & the convalescent & those unable to travel are to take care of it.\n\n24, 25 & 26. All quiet & usual duties.\n\n27 June Thursday, clear & pleasant. 7 PM 2nd Miss. regt. ordered to prepare 1 days rations, each man to fill his canteen, take 1 blanket & 40 rounds of ammunition & the regt. report at R. R. depot at 12 PM & take the cars for Harpers Ferry. Reached Halltown near H. F. at sunrise.\n\n28 June Friday. Stopped an hour & went on the cars, stopped about 1 mile from H. F. leaving our blankets on the cars. Marched & reached the ferry at 7 AM. Companies were detailed by turns to loan machinery, lead, copper & c to send to Winchester. 5 cars were run off the B. & O.R.R. over the bridge into the Potomac. The place looks quite deserted but the rains have made the place much cleaner than when we left it. At 2 PM took up line of march to return to W., made 4 miles to Halltown where we met the cars, got on them, A drizzling rain set in & continued nearly all night. Reached camp about 12 PM hungry & sleepy.\n\n29 June Saturday, fine day. Rested all day. At 4 PM the regt. assembled & discharged the guns at a target at 100 yards, 65 shots per company. Tishomingo Rifles together with Iuka Rifles (muskets) put most balls in target, 5 balls striking. The O'Connor Rifles, however, done the best shooting generally, having Derenger (Mississippi) Rifles.55 The target was 6 feet high by 2 wide.\n\n30 June Sunday, rained all day. Fixed up rolls & c during the day.\n\n1 July, Monday, usual camp duties.\n\n2 July Tuesday. Order cook 2 days rations & be ready to start at any moment. Rations not received & distributed until 12 M. In the midst of it order to fall into line & cooking just commenced, this caused much excitement. As soon as the line was formed we were marched off without canteen or blanket. Many thought we were on a stampede until we got to the big road when we took the Martinsburg direction & reached Bunker Hill, 12 miles, at sundown. Lit fires & drew 1/8 lb. bread & 1/2 lb. bacon per man & laid down on the ground to sleep. Some few blankets were sent to us after we started, mine among the rest. We rested well, the weather being warm. We met on the way 42 Lincoln men taken prisoners. Am told there are many Unionists in these parts.\n\n3 July. Took up line of march toward Martinsburg, to Darksville 5 miles where we bivouaced on the left of the main road in a piece of woods, the 2nd Miss. regt. on the left of the 3rd brigade, Gen. Bee. Gen. Joe Johnston's command here numbers about 10,000 men all camped or bivouaced in order of battle which is expected to be fought here. Having stacked our arms the men about 10 AM cooked whatever provisions they had. Genl. Patterson56 is said to be in Martinsburg with 20,000 men & fortifying his Lincolnites. Gen Jackson57 on our advance somewhat checked Genl. Patterson's advance & then fell back. Our troops are all in good spirits & anxious for the fight. Provisions are scarce & nothing to cook them in.\n\n4 July, cloudy. Co. B on picket guard 1 mile from camp. Nothing transpired worth notice. 12 M Patterson fired the usual artillery salute. As it was quite unexpected our men sprang into line & took their arms believing the fighting was at hand, but it was all a mistake & they soon quieted down. 9 PM drew & cooked 1 days rations, slow work for we had only one skillet in the company to cook bread for 75 men. Some were up cooking all night.\n\n5 July. We are quietly waiting for Patterson & his Lincolnites.\n\n6 July. All quiet like yesterday & dozing about in the shade. Why don't Pat come on? The wheat crop in these parts looks well, corn doing well, hay crop good. Most houses & fences are built of stone, country fine. Union party prevails here about 3 to 1, it is said.\n\n7 July, looks like rain. Co. B skirmish drill 8 to 10 o'clock, at 12 all at dinner when 10 picket guns fired & shortly after the word, to arms, the enemy, but there was no running to & fro & trembling with distress for in less than 1 minute the men were in line & the regt. ready to take the field & the enemy reported 1 1/2 miles off. Blankets & c put in the wagons in hot haste. Our whole brigade advanced obliquely through the Woods, Co. B deployed in front to bring on the attack. The 2nd Miss. marched 3 miles to intercept a scouting party reported to be enemy's resting on a farm nearby. The 1st platoon of Co. B & 4 troopers advanced through a wheat field to cut off the retreat of the party to Martinsburg. We deployed as skirmishers when about 150 yards from the party, found them be part of Capt. Gray's company of mountain rangers,58 our troops. We then returned to camp by 4 1/2 PM, making full 6 miles in less than 3 hours. Our troops were much disappointed that they did not find the enemy. We were only 2 miles from Martinsburg. Genl. Patterson is reported to be entrenching & waiting for McClellan's59 command to join him, also looks for some forces from Harpers Ferry & then expects to clear us out of the Shenandoah Valley. We may fall back to Strasburg.\n\n8 July Sunday. O'Connor Rifles 75 men strong this morning. Orders to return to Winchester. The men are rampant because they did not get a fight. Gen. Johnston told us, boys, we have waited 4 days for the enemy in the open field but they show no desire to attack us, & as it is inconvenient to remain here we will fall back just now, but you shall have as much fighting in a few days as you want. Then went up a joyous yell that made the welkin ring. The 19th Miss. regt., Col. Kit Mott,60 camped at Bunker Hill last night. The enemy is reported 35,000 strong, our force 10,000 strong. At 8 AM took up line of march for Winchester. The day was very hot & oppressive. Reached camp at 5 PM. Batteries were being mounted on Winchester Heights, I suppose to await Patterson & his infernal crew if they have the courage to come. The militia are being brought out in these parts, drilling & working on fortifications.\n\n9. Rested & fixed up camp.\n\n10, day clear. 7 AM the 3rd brigade ordered to strike tents, cook rations, & pack up & leave at a moment's notice. All ready by 10 1/2 Report says the enemy is advancing & will be here by 3 PM. 5 PM they are not here yet. Things quieted down & tents put up again.\n\n11, 12, 13, 14. Changing positions of troops in open field awaiting the enemy, but all quiet.\n\n15. More troops coming into camp, pitched all over the valley.\n\n16. 3 PM, great stir in all camps. Enemy reported at Bunker Hill. Great hurrying in of cavalry, wagons, forming companies, regiments & brigades. 4 PM our 3rd brigade is ordered out & posted just north of the 4th Alabama camp & 1/4 mile from it. Ordered to sleep on the ground we occupy. Our line is in a hollow nearly N & S & cannot be seen 50 yards off. 8 PM rain. Slept well. Co. B 82 men strong.\n\n17. All baggage & tents sent away. Men to have 1 blanket, 1 haversack, & canteen filled.\n\nExtra incidents\n\n1. Harpers Ferry. Billy Rivers (Guyton) on his first sentry duty was posted on the turnpike across the bridge on the Maryland side several Sentry stations from the bridge. The night was very dark & rainy causing frequently pieces of stone to roll down the mountain to the road. These he feared were enemy & challenged as such. Under the excitement he forgot the pass word. How to get it was a puzzle. In his peculiar style he solved the problem by challenging the next sentry and compelling him to come to his post & give it. I forget who the man was - he can tell.\n\n2. Winchester Heights camp. While there we drew several rations of rice. Hank Powers one day concluded that his mess should eat some for dinner so he filled his camp kettle half full of it & set it to cooking nicely but after a while it began to swell & run over. He sent over & borrowed the next mess' kettle & filled it out of his own, still it ran over, still faster until he started all his mess to get kettles, swearing he had enough rice to feed the multitude like the good man we read about did with the five loaves & seven fishes.\n\n3. Corinth camp. The saying \"Here's your mule\". The first I heard of it was this: some man in the neighborhood had lost an old gray mule & was hunting & inquiring for it among the regiment. Co. B had straw in their tents to sleep on, we had 13 tents for the men; No. 13 was a fractional mess among them. Tom Nance,61 by the way one of the best men in the regiment, he had but one weakness, he would take too much whiskey sometimes. His heir was very thin on his head & his ears seemed all the larger for it. Under the general excitement of the day he laid down in his tent to sleep. Some lively fellows roving about or looking for some one happened to look in Tom's tent & being struck with his appearance called out for the mule man, \"Here's your mule\". Others came to see & repeated the saying \"Here's your mule\" & fun & yelling being the order of the day the words were soon spread all over the camp & those adjoining & became a byword everywhere.\n\nThis book was in my knapsack & went off with the baggage so I did not get it back until long after the battle of Manassas. The march, the rout we took, the battle & its incidents I omit, having no-notes on them.\n\nOn July 18 the regiment marched to Piedmont Station (now Delaplane) on the Manassas Gap Railroad and travelled by rail to Manassas, which it reached on July 20. It took position about two miles northeast of Manassas, guarding the fords of Bull Run. When the Federal attack developed on the morning of the 21st the regiment, with all of Bee's brigade that had reached Manassas and with Col. Francis S. Bartow's brigade, moved northward and, with the small brigade of Col. N. G. (Shanks) Evans, contested the Union advance north of the Warrenton turnpike. They were forced back to the Henry House hill, on which Brig. Gen. T. J. Jackson had formed his \"stone wall\", and rallied behind Jackson's line before reforming on his right and left. The Second Mississippi eventually took position on Jackson's left, east of the Manassas-Sudbury road and on the right of Col. J. E. B. Stuart's cavalry. From this poetition it participated in the attack on Rickett's Federal battery, which was charged by Stuart from the flank. In his report of the battle Stuart wrote, \"Participating in the charge was Falkner's regiment (Mississippians), whose gallantry came under my personal observation.\" Gen Joseph E. Johnston's official report named Falkner as one of the thirteen colonels whose conduct in the battle he considered outstanding.\n\nCamp Fisher\n\nWe were camped about Bristoe Station 3 miles from Manassas for several months & then moved to the neighborhood of Dumfries 18 miles off where we went into winter quarters. The Confederate States Congress, needing new troops to supply the place of the 12-months volunteers, the 2nd Miss. being one of that class, it was proposed to continue the regiment & reorganize it by re-enlistments.62 Whereupon the following reenlisted for during the war from Co. B & were furloughed for 30 days to return home & get recruits:\n\n1. Vairin, A.L.P., 10. Braddock, M.J. 23. Richie, A.\n\n1st Sgt. 11. Braddock, S.B. 24. Ray, J.H.Z.\n\n2. Lauderdale, J.C., 12. Cotton, J.H. 25. Sims, G.L.\n\n4th Sgt. 13. Gosset, J.W. 26. Sergeant, W.\n\n3. Coltharp, B., 14. Jones, W.J. 27. Solent,Spight, W.B.\n\n1st Corp. 15. Kelly, J.0. 28. Talbot, A.\n\n4. Holcomb, L.S., 16. Lee, W.C. 29. Whitten, W.C.\n\n4th Corp. 17. Norton, J.A.\n\n5. Adams, S.C., Pvt. 18. McKay, T.B.\n\n6. Blackwell, M.P. 19. Noonan, Dud\n\n7. Blackwell, W.G. 20. Noonan, W.L.\n\n8. Buchanan, J.G. 21. Osburn, Will\n\n9. Bennet, W.J. 22. Pegram, P.G.\n\n11 Feb. 1862. Monday. At 3 1/2 PM these volunteers left Camp Fisher for home under command of Capt. Buchanan.63 Col. Falkner also went. We walked all night over a very rough & frozen road & arrived at Bristoe Station 18 miles at day break & took the cars for home where we arrived after a very cold & disagreable travel. All the companies of the regt. sent a part of their men an furlough like Co. B. We had lots of fun & a good time generally. Under Capt. B's orders I enlisted the following men for Co. B in the following order:\n\n1. Heddon, C. 18. Norton, W.C. 35. Booker, W.G.\n\n2. Norton, W.M. 19. Winborn, J. 36. Yancey, T.J.\n\n3. Sergeant, J.N. 20. Robertson, J.M. 37. Guyton, L.C.\n\n4. Bennett, R.Y. 21. Springer, J. 38. Culp, T.J.\n\n5. Gray, L.M. 22. Gray, William 39. Riley, J.A.\n\n6. Carter, W.R. 23. Saunders, M.K. 40. Wells, L.\n\n7. Carver, J.W. 24. John, H.H. 41.

Green, J.C.\n\n1862, March 20, Thursday, day clearing up. 7-12 AM bade goodby to Ripley friends & started to Saulsbury & Grand Junction with 0. Davis, Esq.64 in a 2 horse buggy. Roads tolerably good. Reached Saulsbury at 2 PM. A train being in waiting we went to the quartermaster's office at G. J. & applied for transportation for 125 men65 from Saulsbury to Corinth on Col. Falkner's order for tomorrow. It was hard to get. Hotel crowded, food & beds poor & hard to get. In 11th Louisiana regt from Columbus, Ky., saw an acquaintance of my old schoolmate Scipio Compton of Alexandria, La. He is represented as drinking all his money & living in the pine woods. A battalion of 90-day troops from New Orleans has just arrived by the Miss. Central R. R.66 They are mostly Creoles, drill well & have a good outfit, also 1 company of the Washington Artillery of N. 0. Saw several old friends from Holly Springs here.

Are promised transportation today by the provost marshal, who is tired of our company. He says we block up the streets. Made requisitions for 2 days rations, bread, pork, sugar & coffee, 1/2 ration of candles, & much trouble to get my requisition accepted for want of approval of my commander. Commissary department poorly managed here, mighty shirky. We start on a train at 12 PM. After putting our baggage on the cars I started to see about our provisions & c in our late quarters & stepped into a mudhole up to my knees. I'm a pretty sight. All right, we are in the cars & laid down & slept some. Some of the boys had a fine time at C. Philbrick's.68 The boys seem to enjoy life so far.\n\n24 March Monday, fine day. This morning find ourselves at Burnsville. Encampments frequent along the road. 9 AM Iuka, 12 M Tuscumbia. Most troops gone to Corinth.\n\n25 March Tuesday. Arrived Stevenson during the night. We will remain here until we start again, this being a changing station. Some of the boys got up a row with a grocery, & c. Left at 12 M, 14 miles from Chattanooga in a short turn in the mountains we met a coal train. It had to back up for us as we had 4 trains behind us. 11 miles from C. one of our front cars ran off the track, got it on again by working 1 hour. Reached Chattanooga at dark. We were ordered by Genl. E. K. Smith to stop here & Col. Falkner to report to Genl. Maxey.69 We stayed in the cars & slept well.\n\n26 March Wednesday.

Here we stay till we start.\n\n28 March Friday. The 9th Miss. regt.70 is here on its way home to disband. Saw several of the Holly Springs boys. I saw Miss Browalow, daughter of Parson Brownlow.71 She is a fine looking lady & reminds me of Mrs. J. Y. Murry of Ripley. This is a fine place. Drew rations at 4 PM & got out of the cars & took lodgings under the eaves of the R. R. depot. Started at 7 1/2 AM travelling slowly, nothing to note. 5 PM Greeneville, Andy Johnson's home.

Reached Lynchburg at sunset. Men soon scattered all over the town.\n\n2 April Wednesday. Windy day, cloudy, misty rain. Men so scattered it seems we will have trouble getting them on the cars. Started at 10 AM, raining. 6 1/2 Danville Junction, travelling very slow. 11 PM when comfortably sleeping in box cars we were ordered to change cars (passenger ones), a poor swap because the men can make their beds on the box car floor & sleep well.\n\n3 April Thursday, clear, fine. Slept badly in the passenger cars, travelled only 14 miles last night. At sunrise just travelling as fast as a man can walk. At 10 AM the train had to be divided. Reached Richmond about 2 PM, day hot. Formed line & marched to the Fredericksburg cars.72 Lots of idle looking officers about the city. Started for F. about 4 PM, travel fast on this line. The country is gently rolling but poor, either gravelly or crawfishy. Reached F. about 8 PM, slept in the cars. Only 1 or 2 men left behind in Richmond.\n\n4 April Friday, frost, clear. Left the cars at sunrise & marched out to camp 3 miles west of Fredericksburg. The boys look better than when I left them at Camp Fisher. The situation is good & a fine field for drilling. It is called Camp Bartow. Made out a new company roll for April for Co. B, 150 men & officers all told. Fine Sergeant T. J. Duncan73 reduced to the ranks for neglect of duty, & his place filled by promotion of H. L. Byrn74 made 4th Corporal. Rules are strict in this camp. Several other regiments adjoin ours.

Made 17 miles by 3 PM to Milford Station on the R. & F. R. R., all wet to the skin. Took cars to Ashland, 30 miles. Our regt. was quartered in the house on the race track, the rest of the brigade had to take the weather. Today was a harder march than yesterday, had sleet & rain all day.

Mistook the road & went 2 miles out of our way. At 5 1/2 PM reached the courthouse. Went about 2 miles & bivouaced in good order.\n\n15 April Tuesday, rain. We got no breakfast because the wagons did not get up in time last night so the men had no time to cook as we took up line of march at 6 AM. 11, sunshine. I got 2 biscuits, 1 egg & a small piece of sausage. We travelled slow, stopped at 4 PM & bivouaced. Made 20 miles today. The country is finely diversified for farming but poor, seems to be best for wheat & small grain. The roads being sandy the men suffered in their feet & complain they are tired. Clear tonight.\n\n16 Wednesday, New Kent Courthouse. Parked the baggage in the wagons, had a job of it. Day clear & warm, roads not so sandy as yesterday & therefore better. At 1 1/2 PM stopped 2 hours to rest the men, made 11 miles. Marched 5 miles farther & bivouaced on a swampy branch for water which was not very good & not at all improved by some men of the 11th Miss. bathing in it above us. At sunset wagons not up yet, the men will have late cooking to do tonight.\n\n17 April Thursday, 5 AM took up line of march. A dispatch from Genl. Joe Johnston orders us to push on as the enemy is advancing to Yorktown. 11, stopped 2 hours to let Riley's Battery80 & others pass us, 24 pieces in all, also Brig. Gen. Steward's cavalry,81 1200 strong, passed us. 4 miles from Williamsburg we stopped to bivouac. We marched about 21 miles today. The men scattered on the road very much but came up at night.\n\n18 April Friday, Reveille at 4 1/2, at 5 1/2 took up line of march. At Williamsburg we were ordered to store all our baggage but blankets, haversacks & canteens as the men's plunder could not be hauled. Clear day. The 3rd Brigade is composed of the 4th Alabama, 6th North Carolina, 11th & 2nd Miss. At 1 1/2 PM stopped 2 or 3 hours to rest. Heard a few cannon while here. Made 5 miles more (being 12 miles today) & camped for the night near Genl. Smith's82 headquarters.\n\n19 April Saturday, Moved to Eagle Farm. Day cloudy. The whole brigade camped together in the woods. We put up shelter tents. The boys had lots of fun catching squirrels, clubbing & shaking & yelling them out of the trees. Lt. Hovis got one & we had squirrel soup for dinner. At 10 PM heavy musketry firing toward the James River. It was made by Longstreet's Division who hearing 3 pickets fire sprang to arms & all commenced firing at nothing. They kept it up 15 or 20 minutes. We were all formed into line expecting to be in for a fight in the dark - Co. B 95 enlisted men - but soon were sent back to our nests. Genl. Whiting made some sharp remarks to our boys for hollowing & yelling when called into line. He charged it to the new recruits & wants it stopped & no mistake as it is useless & unmilitary. The whole brigade was under arms. The enemy's shells have passed clear over this ground from their batteries 1 1/2 miles off. On my way back to nest I got a flat fall in the field by a small stump & vine that caught my foot.\n\n20 April Sunday, rain & bad weather. Little firing on either side today. 8 men left behind came up, Co. B has 123 enlisted men in camp & on detail on this expedition.\n\n21 April Monday, cloudy. 12 M called into line & given orders to reorganize the 2nd Miss. regt. & elect officers. The men in Co. B who were not re-enlisted or recruits wished a new election of our company officers as they were conscripted83 & had taken no part in the late election. A new election resulted as follows: Capt. J. H. Buchanan, viva voce; 1st Lieut. J. C. Lauderdale; 2nd Lieut. W. C. Moody.84 A heavy rain interfered with further election which was postponed until tomorrow. One ballot for Col. was taken which being divided at a late hour & hard rain, further election was postponed until tomorrow. There were several balloting for each company officer except the captain.\n\n22 April Tuesday. At reveille roll call H. L. Byrn was elected Brev. 2nd Lieut. The ballot for Col. last evening showed Capt. J. M. Stone 250, Col. Falkner 249, Capt. H. R. Miller of Co. G, 129. He withdrew from the race. At 7 1/2 AM several speeches & announcements were made by candidates, Col. F., Capt. Stone, John Blair & myself among others. On the second ballot Capt. Stone was elected Col. of the regiment. Much dissatisfaction manifested by Col. F.'s friends.85 Maj. D. Humphreys was elected Lt. Col. by a large majority over all opponents. John Blair was elected Major. Capt. Bates86 got ___ votes, I got 49. Maj. Humphreys is ordered to command the regt. until protests of election questions are settled. I was detailed drillmaster & instructor to Capt. Story, Co. L, several days ago; not an agreeable position.\n\n23 April Wednesday. The spirit to be transferred from Co. B prevails considerably today. 12 of us had ourselves transferred to Co. L, mostly because they had friends or relatives in L. My reasons were various, among which (1) I do not think most of the old members of Co. B have shown me the respect which they should; (2) most of their boasted friendship for me I believe to be a sham; (3) they do not seem to appreciate my efforts to please & benefit them; (4) the present condition of Co. L needs some one to teach them their duty & as I am now detailed for that duty it is important that I be with them all the time; (5) it is my duty to our cause to help where best I can.\n\nCol. Stone took command of the regiment. Sgt. Owen87 is made Adjutant, Walter Rutledge,88 Sergeant Major. So far things are as well as can be expected. Co. L is not yet provided with arms & accoutrements or cooking utensils. What few guns they have are borrowed or spare ones from other companies. Here I act as Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Corporal & High Private & Instructor. We drill in an oat field nearby. Riley's battery is near us. The whole division is here.\n\n24 April, day clear. I drilled & instructed Co. L all day.\n\n25 April, cloudy & windy. All the old non-re-elected company & regimental officers relieved from duty & start for Richmond this morning by order of the Secretary of War. Rain all day.\n\n26, 27, 28, 29, & 30, bad rainy weather generally. There are many marks of Washington's old works still visible here,89 rifle pits, & c which with a little work could be used. Had to wash my shirt today.\n\n1 May Thursday. 7 AM orders cook 3 days rations to start by daylight. Day cloudy.\n\n2 May Friday, cloudy. Wagons left at 7 AM. 12 M we have not left yet. Drew 1 days rations of crackers & bacon. 6 1/2 PM formed line & fell back 1/2 mile & bivouaced in a lane. A little cannonading. 12 PM rain.\n\n3 May Saturday. At daybreak fell back 1/2 mile & found the division in the woods on the left of the road to Williamsburg. Sun rose through the clouds. No indication of the object of our moves but I suppose they are to draw the enemy into battle. 6 1/2 PM orders to keep ready to fall in at a moment's notice. Drew flour & bacon. There was a great time generally in camp, cooking without utensils; old pieces of board, bark, gun rods & sticks were used to bake bread on. 12 PM called into line to march but were soon ordered back to bed.\n\n4 May Sunday. At daybreak fell into line & took up line of march forming the rear of the column. Left in front just behind Hampton's Legion90 going toward Williamsburg. The roads tolerably good considering the immense travel done on them lately. Marched easily, stopped frequently, reached Williamsburg at 11 AM. We did not have time to get the knapsacks & c we had stored there. About 12 our division took the road to West Point, made 5 miles & stopped to draw & cook rations. It is reported by men of Riley's battery who were in our rear that the Yankeys followed us closely & made a few shots at our cavalry picket who lagged behind to make observations. From the firing in the direction of Williamsburg I infer the enemy is near there & is making some demonstrations on the breastworks at that place,91 or perhaps the batteries are trying the range of their guns. Orders are to pack up all cooking utensils as soon as possible & be ready to move at any moment. We laid down & slept the best we could.\n\n5 May Monday. 2 AM took up line of march toward West Point. At 1 1/2 miles we turned square to the left & reached the Richmond & Williamsburg road about 2 miles farther. It rained nearly all last night & today. At 12 M we stopped, made fires, and eat. I think we have travelled about 18 miles to this point. Shirts, blankets & other clothing thrown away by the overloaded men scattered all along the road but not as much as yesterday. I believe the baggage we stored at Williamsburg is all lost, mine with the rest. At 6 PM we marched 5 miles & stopped for the night. Rain all day long.\n\n6 May Tuesday, clear & windy. No orders to move. The men seem none the worse for yesterday's march. We are about 2 miles from West Point. 3 PM into line & marched 1/2 mile & stopped in a pine thicket to rest & fix up to stay. 8 PM into line again & move back 1/2 mile in the woods. No fires allowed as the Yankey gunboats can shell us from the river. The commissary wagons are not here so no rations are issued & the hungry men complain as usual. Slept well.\n\n7 May Wednesday, clear & pleasant. Made fires & warmed. Rations arrived & ready to be issued when orders came to fall into line & took position in the field for battle. As we did not get our rations we all felt hungry. About 11 AM picket firing on our front which stampeded a drove of cattle which came charging on our line. The men turned the course of all the cattle but one large bull which charged full on Co. F throwing down several men & hurt one very seriously if not fatally. 46 Yankey prisoners were taken, our troops had 3 killed & 8 wounded.92 Hampton's Legion mistook the 5th Texas who are dressed in U. S. clothing for Yankeys, fired on them & killed 3 & wounded several others. About 3 PM we were marched to our blankets & haversacks & posted in a wood nearby having no rations. The men parched corn for supper & breakfast. Clouding up.\n\n8 May Thursday. 3 AM took up line of march toward Richmond. Made my breakfast on parched corn. It is very good when one has nothing better. It seems we must have been very close to the enemy as we had a skirmish line moving about 200 yards on our flank & talking forbidden. 12 M reached New Kent Courthouse. 2 miles beyond it we kept to the right on the Telegraph road. 1 1/2 miles farther we stopped for bivouac, made 12 to 14 miles today. Are about 1 mile from the White House at the head of York River navigation. The enemy's boats are there & their pickets on this side of the river. The 12th, 13th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, & 21st Miss. regiments passed us today since we left New Kent. Drew 1 days rations of corn meal & bacon, much relished by all as we have had nothing to eat for 2 days. Co. E buried 1 man who died of measles on the road.\n\n9 Friday, clear, Wagons sent on. 1 PM took up line of march, went 1 mile, a courier brought word the enemy were at New Kent fighting our pickets & rear guard. Riley's battery turned back & we stopped & formed line of battle. 2 Yankey cavalry pickets previously passed us. 5 PM continued our march 3 miles & bivouaced. No rations issued.\n\n10 May Saturday, clear. Drew 2 crackers & 1/2# bacon per man. 3 PM enemy reported 1 1/2 miles behind us. Formed line. The ground in our front is rough woods. 4 PM not moved yet. 6 1/2 PM resumed our march 1 1/2 miles & camped. Fine clear moonshine.\n\n11 Sunday, clear & pleasant.\n\n12, clear & pleasant. At sunset moved 1/2 mile east.\n\n13 May, clear & pleasant.\n\n14 Wednesday, cloudy. 8 PM formed line & stacked arms & returned to quarters. Rain all the afternoon.\n\n15 May Thursday, raining. 12 M we marched 4 miles to the Chickahominy River which we crossed about 12 PM. Dark night, rained all day. We were delayed by Genl. McGruder's93 army in our front & very bad & muddy roads. Camped on a steep hillside, lit fires, drew & cooked rations all night. The farms & crops from Williamsburg here are tolerably good but badly damaged by the troops, fences all burned on the rout.\n\n16 May Friday, 8 AM marched 8 or 10 miles toward Richmond. Mud deep, slippery & tiresome to travel. 3 PM stopped for the night in an old field. No wood but old rails & they scarce.\n\n17 May Saturday, clear. 12 M moved to 1 mile from Richmond & camped in a grove of small timber.\n\n18, clear, 19 rain, 20 clear, 21 & 22, nothing.\n\n23. Wrote letters to friends. Severe cannonading. PM went on fatigue duty on the West Point R. R.94 to clear away brush for a place of observation.\n\n24 Saturday, rain all day. I went to Richmond, found things were sold 200 to 300 percent. Mailed my letters, did not buy anything for want of money.\n\n25, cloudy. Wrote letters to friends.\n\n26 Monday, rain. 9 AM ordered to be ready to march with 1 blanket, canteen, haversack. Rained all night but we did not move.\n\n27 May Tuesday, rain. PM clear.\n\n28, clear. 4 PM Co. L drew Harpers Ferry muskets, cal. 56 & 20 rounds of ammunition. 6 1/2 PM Co. L & 40 men from Cos. K & F with 2 days cooked rations, canteens & 1 blanket took up line of march in silence to near Chickahominy River. By 11 o'clock it rained & was so dark it was impossible to march in order in the deep mud. The whole command got so badly scattered there were not 1/2 the men together when we stopped & were ordered to sleep on our arms on the roadside.\n\n29 May Thursday. Returned to camp. Clear day.\n\n30 Friday, cloudy. 8 AM took up line of march toward West Pt. for 5 miles. Halted, stacked arms near a church. Hear cannon on our right. A battle is looked for. The church is headquarters hospital. 12 M clearing. 2 PM marched to the battlefield. Couriers gave no directions where our position was to be so our regt. went wandering about through swamps, ponds, thickets, mud & c heading all the time for the heaviest of the firing which kept changing so much. We passed through several vacated Yankey camps which they had abandoned in haste leaving their dinner post still boiling over the fire & camp in fine order. We were after them so hot we did not have time to eat their dinner for them. Came to one of their breastworks where we fired a few shots after their fleeing men. Here Genl. Hood's brigade came up behind us, they being dressed in blue we took them for Yankeys. Our rear rank was faced about to fight front & rear but the Texans made themselves known. Genl. Hood directed us to the point we should have taken. We reached the West Pt. R. R.95 & proceeded to our position at dusk. We were marching to the right flank quickly when the head of our line came up near the center of a Yank regt. which opened fire. To form line of battle as it should have been with so many undrilled recruits was out of the question so we were ordered to face about & retreat by the left flank. As fortune would have it, when we reached the R. R. about 300 yards back the officer at that end of the line ordered a halt which was not well understood. Just across the R. R. was a swamp & pond which made matters worse for the men were all huddled in a tangled mass making confusion worse confounded. Some of the men followed the R. R. track to form line, many were pushed by the crowd into the swamp & pond. It was soon so dark it was impossible to see an object of any kind. Several men in Co. L were wounded & in most of the companies while in the jam at the R. R. However, the enemy sounded the retreat on the bugle twice & we remained masters of the field.96 The 2nd Miss. regt. lost 5 men killed & 30 wounded in this evening's encounter. Having left our blankets when we went to the battlefield we fared badly during the night in an open field looking for an attack at any moment. As we were going into the fight we passed only a few rods & in full view of Genl. Joe Johnston who was wounded as we passed him & his staff. I saw him fall. This is the battle of 7 pines.\n\nJune 1, Sunday. This morning we got into the abandoned Yankey bivouac from which the Confederates got 100 barrels of Whickey, 100 sacks of coffee, oil clothes & rubber sheets, tents, & c. At daybread the regt. moved into the brushy woods a short distance back of our line to be screened from the view of the enemy. There was very little firing during the day. The enemy sent us a few rifled shells at about 1000 yards during the day which was tolerably pleasant. An attempt was made to take the Yankey battery, but a swamp in its front prevented. At 6 PM we moved to near the church hospital before mentioned. Drew rations & slept under arms. We saw a Yankey balloon of observation.97\n\n2 June Monday. At sunrise we moved 3 miles toward Richmond & moved back to 1/2 mile from where we started at sunrise. Stacked arms & rested. Little connanading & no musketry today. Saw 3 Yankey balloons. Drew rations & stayed all night.\n\n3 Tuesday. At sunrise moved NE 1 mile. Shot off our guns, cleaned them & moved E 1/2 mile to support Riley's battery. 6 PM heavy rain set in & lasted all night. We fixed shelter tents with our blankets. Kept dry & slept well.\n\n4 Wednesday, raining. Men were detailed to erect masked batteries. The Yanks are said to have three batteries that can open on our position. They sent up a balloon every 2 hours yesterday & today but they remained up only a few minutes at a time.\n\n5 June Thursday. 8 1/2 AM our batteries opened briskly on the enemy & they responded in like. Our position has moved more to the left. Shells flew about lively for several hours.\n\n6 June Friday, cloudy & rain. 9 AM 2nd & 11th Miss. regt. went on picket. Co. B deployed as skirmishers on left, is near Chickahominy River in sight of a Yankey camp & their pickets on the other side of the river. Co. L 29 men in camp, rest all sick. 9 PM relieved from picket moved back 2 miles to our former camp.\n\n7 June Saturday, 2 PM heavy rain, our camp is a regular swamp. We get water by digging holes 2 feet deep. The water rises to the top & is tolerably good. The rain flooded the whole camp, the water is 2 inches deep in my shelter tent. Have piled up brush to keep my bed out of the water.\n\n8 June, cloudy, windy. A camp trader came by with his wagon of notions. He only asked $2.00 per box of sardines. The boys stole part of his goods. He made complaint to Col. Stone who said it was good for him. Made him take the road back to Richmond. 9 AM into line, moved 1 mile to meet the enemy. Learn that 1 company of a Texas regt. on picket attached 2 companies of Yanks, killed 40, took 1 prisoner, & the rest ran away. 11 AM returned to camp.\n\n9 June Monday, clear. 9 AM the regt. moved out to support batteries. Cannon fire frequently on both sides. 11 AM rain came down very hard. While fixing up his shelter tent Jim Bever's98 gun went off & hurt his hand so bad it may disable him from service.\n\n10 Tuesday. Co. L detailed 13 men to work on trenches. Other companies in proportion. No cannonading today.\n\n11 Wednesday. 9 AM regt. moved to the place we occupied Sunday to cook rations & prepare to march. Rumor says to support Stonewall Jackson. 2 PM the 3rd brigade marched to Richmond, 2nd Miss. in rear. We had to stand in the streets nearly 5 hours before we could get in the cars. All the men in camp & convalescents that can march go which makes the regt. 1200 strong. Co. L 65 enlisted men & 4 commissioned officers. We got in the cars about 7 PM. 30 cars & 2 locomotives to carry 2nd Miss., 4th Ala., 6th N. C. & Riley's battery. Moon is in eclipse tonight. Many delays & stoppings. Genl. Whiting in command. Lynchburg 8 PM. Moved 1/2 mile west of town & camped.\n\n12 June, included in the 11th.\n\n13 Friday, clear & warm. I got a pass & went to town to get some things. 7 PM into line & marched to the cars. It was 12 PM before the rear of the regt. got there & then Cos.

L 68 men strong today, the rest sent to Ferguson hospital, Dr. McCrory99 of Rienzi in charge. Learn that since Genl. Beauregard fell back from Corinth the Yankeys have been to Ripley. 11 PM got in the cars for Charlottesville. We had all sorts of a day of it on the R. R. platform.\n\n15 June Sunday. Got to Charlottesville at 8 AM & were taken to the University grounds to rest. The University is now used as a hospital. There are 300 to 500 sick in it. The people take much interest in their welfare. It is a beautiful place. The buildings are extensive & well arranged. It deserves more note than I can give it now. At 9 1/2 AM took the cars for the terminus of our rout by R. R. In rout we passed through 3 tunnels. No. I is about 300 feet long, No. 2 is about 1/4, & No. 3, 1 1/2 miles long. They were very dark. There are several beautiful valleys on the rout. The crops look well. We reached Staunton at 3 PM, 123 miles from Richmond.100 The regt. is camped on a wooded hill near the R.

Jackson's army is in front of us. Genl. Ewell102 5 miles on our left.\n\n19 Thursday, clear, warm. 5 AM into line, marched over the Blue Ridge. Sent 18 men on the cars sick & broken down. It is much more tiresome to walk down hill than up, it jams up the toes & shocks the whole system. Made 9 miles & rested 1/2 hour in the sun. Made 15 miles today. Co. L camped with 18 men, started with 56. Drew 3 days rations & cooked them by 12 PM.\n\n20 June Friday, warm & clear. 9 AM marched to Greenwood station & took the cars.

R. on the banks of a beautiful swift branch & some springs. McBride of Co. F got jerked off the cars by a fence stake. We passed the 16th Miss regt. this side of Charlottesville. It has been in Jackson's command since the battle of Manassas, & has been reduced from 1000 men to about 250 by battles & sickness.\n\n21 Saturday, clear & pleasant. 12 M drew 2 days rations & cooked them, a hard job as wood is scarce & we have no axes & the night is dark.\n\n22 Sunday, pleasant, clouding up. Done nothing.\n\n23 Monday, cloudy. 4 1/2 AM into line & march toward Richmond. Travel easy, stop frequently. The crops look fine, wheat harvest, clover & grass fine. 11 AM hot.

Made 15 to 17 miles today by 5 PM. 9 PM heavy rain which lasted all night, a perfect flood. 2 1/2 inches of rain fell. There is much talk in camp that France & England require Lincoln to close the war in 30 days. Peace propositions, & c, & c. We will see.\n\n24 June Tuesday, cloudy & rain. 12 AM marched to 5 miles from Ashland, stopped several times. 5 PM a heavy shower of rain came up & wet us through & through. Muddy walking, very slippery. The roads were tolerably good before the shower. About 1 mile before we stopped there was a beautiful rainbow, a fit prognostic to the prophets of the success of our expedition & our fondest hopes. The heavy rain last night raised all the creeks & delayed the movement of troops. 10 PM drew 2 days rations of flour. At 1 AM drew beef. Had to cook all before day. Rather hard after marching 12 to 13 miles in 1/2 day.\n\n25 Wednesday, clear. 6 AM marched 3 miles & rested till 12 AM, then marched 1 mile to Ashland & filed off toward Richmond 1 1/2 miles & rested. When we reached Ashland we saw a Yankey cavalry flag on the opposite side of the race track. 4 Yankey scouts were captured by the 11th Miss. 4 miles from Ashland. Camped in the night, drew 2 days rations of crackers.\n\n26 June Thursday, clear at daybreak. Into line with only 1 blanket, haversack, canteen, gun & cartridge box & headed due east then south & every other direction. We passed the 47th & 48th Alabama regiments, come to Genl. Jackson. The 47th from Huntsville had to leave for the Yanks. Our course of march was toward the West Pt. R. R. & New Kent. The enemy was driven back about 2 miles across a creek, they burned the bridge & felled trees trying to obstruct the road & pursuit. Cannon firing a late hour at night on our right, along the Chickahominy 8 or 9 miles on our right. We travelled 12 or 13 miles today & passed several deserted Yankey camps. Bivouaced in one of them & all got pretty lousy.\n\n27 June Friday. clear. Firing in the same direction as last night. 6 PM formed line. 80 or more prisoners passed us with guard about 9 AM. Hill's104 division drove the enemy across the Chickahominy at Mechany105 last evening & came up with us about 10 AM. The boys are in good spirits & keep up well. We have but one non-commissioned officer in Co. L, Corp. Ward.106 At 4 to 5 PM the 2nd Miss. regt. got into action at Gaines Farm. In forming line of battle Cos. L & C being on the left of the regt. Extended into a dense & impenetrable thicket of bamboo, briars & thorns through which it was impossible to move or execute orders. Seeing the situation I cautioned Major Blair of the fact but with his usual fool vanity he ordered us to extend into the brush. As I expected when the regt. Marched into action it was impossible for Co. L to execute or hear the order so it was left in the briars. Suspecting the regiment was moving I made my way to the open ground & found the regt. gone & started back to the company & reported the fact to Capt. Story. The company got out of the brush & (battle of Gaines Farm,107 Beaverdam Creek) attached itself to a Texas regiment pushing into action; about 200 yards from the enemy a ball struck me in the pit of the stomach. My blanket, which is a twilled one & very strong, I wore as a scarf. It arrested the force of the ball which twisted it & so checked its force that it did not penetrate through it & saved my life but I was deathly sick at the stomach for the rest of the day & night & went back to the blanket guard to sleep as I did not know where to find the regiment. Several men from Co. L & other companies who got scattered from the command came there. This was a big fight & we took many prisoners, at least 2,000. Little firing during the night.\n\n28 June Saturday. Soon in the morning we hunted up the regt. which was camped 1/2 mile in front of where we lost it. The regt. lost fewer than I expected. Co. B got ___ killed, ___ wounded,108 Co. L 2. I went over the battlefield. The enemy were well posted & killed & wounded many of our men in front of their works; in fact if Genl. Whiting had not moved his brigade & taken them in flank all our forces could not have moved them from their position.109 Back of their lines they had their camp. In front of their works we lost hundreds of men & on crossing them found that they had suffered fully as much or more than we had. Their ground was covered with dead & wounded, knapsacks, overcoats, blankets & arms of all sorts. & c, & c. About 9 AM the brigade moved through part of the battlefield & near to where the regt. stood last night. The Yank Genl. McClellan supplies his men with plenty of whiskey if one may judge from the number of drunk prisoners we took yesterday & the number of empty bottles over their camps. We rested on the battlefield all day. Toward evening we were moved to an old field nearby & camped for the night. This battlefield is the camps we saw from our position on the 5th & 6th before we started to join Jackson. Drew 2 days rations of crackers.\n\n29 June Sunday, cloudy & rainy, cleared up. Orders to prepare to march. All day great smoke from Yankey lines, they are burning up things. 7 to 8 PM heavy firing of small arms & cannon south of us. 8 1/2 laid down to sleep. Rain. I suffer from a sore eye, the left one. It bothers me very much.\n\n30 Monday, cleared up at daybreak. Moved south about 1 mile & got on a road the Yankeys made, crossed Chickahominy River on a bridge the Yankeys built. They had cut it down about 1 1/2 miles further. Came to the Richmond & York R. R. between the 7 & 8 mile post & moved along the R. R. about 1 1/2 mile to where the battle of yesterday took place. Few of our men dead or wounded just where we passed but report says we lost many men. All the farms in these parts are a wilderness. Immense quantities of clothing, blankets scattered everywhere, whole camps of tents left standing as used. The enemy must have left in hot haste. They burned immense quantities of military stores. Nearly all the homes are occupied as hospitals. We continued our march toward the Chickahominy bridge on the York road. 1 1/2 mile from it we stopped to rest & for the bridge to be repaired. The 17th Miss. regt. got badly crippled in last night's fight. Squads of prisoners frequently pass us, also large droves of horses. All their sick & wounded fell into our hands. They are attended by their own surgeons. Report says the Yankeys are making their way to the James River to be protected by their gunboats. All the woods & fields seem to have been occupied by their troops. Even their bivouacs are as well provided & supplied with conveniences as our best camps. We followed them as far across the Chickahominy as Battery Bridge & a swamp called White Oak & bivouaced sleeping on our arms.\n\n1 July Tuesday, Malvern Hill. Clear & warm. We marched in pursuit of the enemy. On approaching their position, Malvern Hill, they shelled us hard in the middle of the road. We had to open ranks right & left to let a battery & cavalry pass which caused confusion & separated Co. L from the regt. & it was some time before it rejoined it as it was moving all the time. The regt. was placed in a wheatfield along the edge of a swampy wood & in line of flank perpendicular to the left of the battlefield & so situated that 3 of the enemy's batteries could enfilade our ranks. We could plainly see a large part of the enemies on the field of battle & see them move to the attack. I see no extra tactics in the execution of their movements. One of our batteries (the German)110 was on our left & in line with us. The enemy discovered it & our position & started a battery to enfilade us & our battery. We then fell back into the woods out of range of their fire. Our battery was soon silenced by their 3. Still they shelled & grape shotted us with a vengeance for 2 hours. Having the advantage of the banks of a small creek we were somewhat protected but we had a number of men wounded. J. Ward, 1st Corp. Co. L was instantly killed by a piece of shell as he lay down in the wheatfield. Other pieces of the same shell knocked the dirt on me & peppered me so I thought I was torn to pieces. W. was next to me & we did not know he was hurt till we got up to change position. During the night the enemy's wagons & artillery made a great deal of noise moving to the rear.\n\n2 July Tuesday, rain, rain as hard as I ever saw it till 3 PM. We were moved back some distance to draw rations. Only a small part of our regt. were engaged yesterday. Several play outs came to the regt. about 5 PM. Drew 2 days rations & bivouaced.\n\n3 July Thursday. The enemy seems to be completely routed & gone to the James River to be under protection of their gunboats. Our scouts followed them to the river & report the woods are full of arms & accoutrements, wagons & cannon, all abandoned. Hope they are annihilated. The The enemy is said to have lost in killed & wounded many more than we have. We have taken many prisoners. The rain yesterday must have interfered very much with gathering the dead & wounded as well as the army plunder. Our whole division was formed in an oats field adjoining the wheatfield we were in on the 1st & drew 2 days rations of flour & bacon. Having no cook vessels bread was generally baked on sticks.\n\n4 July Friday. I don't feel well. At break of day marched toward Charles City Court House. 12 AM reached X roads 25 miles to Richmond, 9 miles to C. City, 8 miles to long bridge. Day warm, water scarce. Stopped often. Many reports of all sorts about. Brigade formed in close column by divi"
