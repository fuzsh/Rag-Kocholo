Sherer.\n\n3\n\nPreface.\n\nIn the presentation of our History of the Thirty-Sixth Regiment, Illinois Volunteers, to the public, we have no apologies to offer for what may seem an intrusion, in adding another volume to the already overburdened \"literature of the war.\" The survivors of the \"Old Thirty-Sixth\" have long felt the want of such a work, for one among many other reasons, to correct the errors and to supply the omissions of the general historian. They, many years ago, inaugurated measures looking to the collection of the annals of the Regiment, and their publication. A historian was appointed, and committees from each company selected to assist in the collection of material, and to collate and prepare it for the press. But little progress was made, and as the years passed by and the work was not accomplished, or even fairly commenced, other appointments were made, but without satisfactory results. At the annual reunion of the surviving comrades in 1875, another historian was selected, new auxiliary committees created, and an impetus given which promised success. The new historian early associated with him the former one, and dividing the work between them, the result has been the present volume.\n\nFew persons can comprehend the great labor and difficulties attending the preparation of a work of this kind. At the very outset, those who were expected to contribute materials were scattered over much of the Western Hemisphere, and to reach\n\n4\n\nthem and obtain their contributions was a herculean task. Then to sift facts from fiction, and to see that all parties or portions of the regiment were properly represented, required much tact and skill.\n\nThe parties engaged in the preparation of the work have written independently of each other, each taking up a period of time and detailing the events within that period, without the aid of the other. A difference in style, and other features, will enable the reader to readily determine the authorship of different portions of the work, and yet it may be proper to state that the first twenty and last seven chapters, as well as the appendix, were prepared by Mr. Bennett, while Mr. Haigh wrote the remainder — embracing a period from October 9th, 1862, to the occupation of Columbia, in November, 1864, being more than two years of the most eventful portion of the regimental history.\n\nOur sources of information have been various, and with some truth, it may be said, the work is a compilation, as well as an original composition. We have drawn largely from journals and papers kindly furnished by individual members of the regiment, and their number, if for no other reason, is an ample excuse for not mentioning each by name. All, however, have our thanks for such expressions of their interest and kindly regard. A few of the incidents and anecdotes have heretofore been published and appropriated by other parties, and they are reproduced here only to restore them to their rightful owners. We have like-wise had access to most of the official reports of officers under whom the 36th had the honor to serve, and have made free use of their contents as far as it suited our purpose. Among the many histories of events connected with, or growing out of the Rebellion, we acknowledge with pleasure the assistance we have derived from \"Van Horne's History of the Army of the Cumberland,\" a work of superior merit, and one we would commend to those who desire a truthful and unbiased account of the events of which it treats. In making extracts from this, or other works, we have aimed to give each due credit, and, where this has not been done, it may be regarded as a mistake of types or pen, rather than the intention of the writers.\n\n5\n\nThe work as now presented is more voluminous than originally intended, but we believe it is exceedingly rich in such matter as the historian of the future will be rejoiced to find; and, however large its dimensions, we are convinced there are yet stores of untouched material sufficient for a volume equally large. We have aimed to rescue the heroic deeds of the Thirty-Sixth, as well as the names of the actors from oblivion, and to erect a monument that would perpetuate to all time the brilliant achievements of a regiment which, in disinterested patriotism, deeds of daring and distinguished services, is second to none. The statistics will bear us out in the statement that in proportion to their numbers no other regiment in all the armies of the United States lost so many killed in battle, or so few from disease, as the Thirty-Sixth Illinois.\n\nWith these general remarks, relative to the construction and object of the work, we submit it to a generous, reading public, making no claim to literary skill or perfection, and yet hoping that the perusal of its pages will prove a source of pleasure and profit to many. If, through it, we have assisted in the growth of true patriotism, inculcated a love of country, or refreshed the laurels of both the living or the dead, we are content.\n\nTHE AUTHORS.\n\nYORKVILLE, ILL., July 20th, 1876.\n\n9\n\nChapter I. — Introductory.\n\nPage Image\n\nTWENTY YEARS of ceaseless agitation of the \"Slavery Question,\" engendered sectional animosities, which, intensified with each succeeding political campaign, and each fresh triumph of the anti-slavery party, eventually culminated in the election of Abraham Lincoln as Chief Magistrate of the Republic. This event served to embitter the pro-slavery faction beyond the bounds of reason, and was used by them as a pretext for breaking into pieces the government of which they for a long series of years had held absolute control. The result of that election was hardly known, when South Carolina fulminated her Ordinance of Secession amidst a wild storm of enthusiasm which swept over the whole South. State after State seceded and rapidly wheeled into line with Carolina. For months before the inauguration of the\n\n10\n\nincoming administration, the \"sacred soil of secessia\" echoed the tread of armies and the din of preparation.\n\nGovernment forts and arsenals were seized, arms distributed among the people, debts due Northern creditors repudiated, and citizens of the free States forcibly ejected from her borders. Outrage succeeded outrage in such rapid succession and unparalleled audacity, as even a state of savage warfare would scarcely justify. Backed by a people eager for the onset, the whole South, from the rivers to the gulf, glittered with bayonets and glowed with martial fires.\n\nThose who remained true to the constitution and flag of the country, and unshaken in their allegiance to the Republic, were, with few exceptions, reserved and silent. Southern conventions with their accompaniments of bombast and folly, and Southern orators with their frothy gasconade, were heard with supreme indifference or profound contempt. For, had not the same things been witnessed before? Had not the same orators often deluged the country with denunciation and menace when defeat at the polls had only been feared? Now, when they had suffered a crushing defeat at a fair election, which all their mad efforts had not been able to prevent, their resolutions and threats were regarded as the insane ravings of lunatics, or the harmless thunder of disappointed politicians, rather than the deliberate action of cool headed, reflecting men. Even their ordinances of secession, and the establishment of insurgent governments, were common laughing stocks at the North, and regarded rather as a stupendous game of intimidation than the preliminary steps to rebellion and war.\n\nWith the bombardment and fall of Sumpter, the eyes of the nation opened, and indignation flashed through the astonished land, arousing the loyal men of the nation from their stupor.\n\n11\n\nThe rebound was tremendous, breaking the calm placidity of the people. The whole North quivered with a new emotion. The strong lines of party were snapped asunder, and forgetful of past political differences, each regarded the other as a fellow citizen of one common country, animated with kindred feelings and purposes, and disposed to bury personal strifes for the sake of home and country. Patriotism, which had so long been spurned by politicians and at best regarded as a pleasant myth, sprang to life in a single day and blossomed into fruitfulness — that fruit, a stern resolve to sacrifice position, life and all in defence of the Republic.\n\nMingling with the doleful reverberations from Sumpter, was heard the President's call for seventy-five thousand men, to meet and combat the oncoming hosts of rebellion. Before a single day had passed the lightnings had flashed back to the Capitol that twice that number were ready to march at the tap of the drum, and that thousands were then on their way to rescue and to save. Never was summons to arms more promptly responded to. In a single day the hum of manufactories and of the peaceful occupation of laborers in the fields was drowned by the tramp of hurrying thousands thronging to the designated places of rendezvous.\n\nUnder that first call for seventy-five thousand men, six regiments was the quota allotted for Illinois to furnish. In the war with Mexico the State had contributed six regiments, every one of which returned covered with glory as well as honored scars. Each had won laurels distinctively its own, and in order not to mingle their achievements with the deeds of other regiments bearing the same numbers, and to leave the survivors in undisturbed possession of the glory attached to the numbers of the regiments to which their bravery had given eclat, it was thought\n\n12\n\nbest to leave these numbers undisturbed. Thus the first regiment mustered into service from Illinois in the war to suppress the Rebellion, was the Seventh, which heads the list of the one hundred and seventy regiments of all arms furnished by the State.\n\nThousands who sought service in the ranks of these six regiments were refused. Recruiting offices were closed and eager applicants turned away with the comforting assurance that the \"Rebellion would be over in sixty days.\" So thought public men, and so thought the mass of the people. And yet each day the rebellion grew more powerful and more difficult to suppress.\n\nAt length the disaster at Bull Run opened the eyes of the people to the magnitude of the contest into which the country had been reluctantly drawn, and to the imminent danger which imperilled and threatened the existence of the Republic. Following upon this defeat of the undisciplined militia of the North, came a second uprising of the people, and other calls for troops. Again the fires of patriotism burned afresh. The enlistment, mustering and arming of volunteer regiments went on with astonishing celerity, and from these at last was evoked an army of soldiers, whose swelling cohorts were crowded to the front and hurled upon an over confident and vaunting foe.\n\nThe Fox River Valley was all ablaze with enthusiasm. The stalwart sons of its people were eager to grasp their firelocks and press forward to the fray. A meeting of parties interested in the formation of a \"Fox River Regiment\" was held at Geneva on the 29th day of July, 1861, and preliminary steps taken for its organization. Fifteen companies, either complete or in an advanced state of formation, were represented and tendered for acceptance, twelve of which were selected, including two cavalry companies. The Aurora Beacon and other newspapers in the District aided the project by stirring appeals to the patriotism\n\n13\n\nof the people. In furtherance of this object Mr. George S. Bangs, D. W. Young and others applied to the War Department, as well as to the State authorities, for permission to proceed with the organization, which was speedily granted. Major Nicholas Greusel, of the Seventh Illinois Volunteers, then on duty at Cairo, was designated to take charge of its organization and equipment for the field. In compliance with orders from Governor Yates, he proceeded to Aurora and assumed the direction of all matters pertaining to the enlistment, the discipline, the equipment and supplies necessary for so large a body. In short, he assumed the entire command and led it to its designated field of action. The order assigning him to the command is as follows:\n\n\"GENERAL HEADQUARTERS STATE OF ILLINOIS,\n\nADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,\n\nSPRINGFIELD, AUG. 14TH, 1861.\n\nGENERAL ORDER, No. 139.\n\nLieut. Col. N. Greusel, of the 7th Illinois Volunteers, is hereby promoted to the Colonelcy of the Fox River Regiment, Ill. Vols., and as such is to be respected and obeyed.\n\nBy order of the Commander in Chief.\n\nTHOMAS L. MATHER, Adjutant General.\"\n\nThis order was all the commission or authority which any officer, except one Lieutenant, received in connection with the 36th, until after eight months of hard service.\n\nCOL. NICHOLAS GREUSEL was born in Bavaria, Germany, July 4th, 1817, and was forty-four years of age on assuming the command of the Regiment. He received a fair education in French and German in the schools in his native city of Blieskastle. The Greusels, consisting of father, mother, and nine brothers and sisters, emigrated to the United States in the summer of 1834, and on arriving at the City of New York, strangers and penniless, the larger boys were told by their father that they were now in a\n\n14\n\nfree country; that he had nothing more than a parent's blessing to bestow, and that they must commence the battle of life for themselves, but that in case of sickness or misfortune such a home as he might be in possession of should be theirs.\n\nWithout knowing a word of the English language, the future to these poor lads looked dark and gloomy. The boy Nicholas wandered over the city for hours in search of employment, when, after many failures and rebuffs, a lady of benevolent and kindly mien admitted him to a sheltering roof and gave him work. The lady who at this dark hour proved an angel of mercy to him was the mother of Hamilton Fish, once Senator from New York, and now President Grant's Secretary of State.\n\nHere Nicholas remained a year, when the whole family removed to the then wilderness territory of Michigan, reaching Detroit by canal and steamer, November 1st, 1835. At first such odd jobs as could be found were resorted to for a livelihood, such as driving team, gathering ashes, etc., but in the spring he obtained a permanent situation in the firm of Rice, Coffin & Co., in the business of lumbering, and remained in their employ for eleven years, until the breaking out of the Mexican war. Prior to this he had served as Captain of the \"Scott Guards,\" a local military company, and subsequently as Major of the \"Frontier Guards,\" and was nominally on duty during the \"Patriot Rebellion\" in Canada. At the municipal election in Detroit in 1844 he was elected Alderman of the 4th Ward on the Whig ticket, and served in that capacity two years. On the breaking out of the Mexican war he recruited a company for service and was elected its Captain, being Co. D., 1st Regt. Michigan Vols. On setting out for their campaign they marched on foot to Springfield, Ohio, thence by rail to Cincinnati, and by steamer to New Orleans and Vera Cruz, which place was reached ten days after its surrender to General Scott.\n\n15\n\nIn the march upon the city of Mexico the Michigan Volunteers were attached to the Division of General Bankhead, which marched through Cordova and Orizaba some distance south of the National Road to the Mexican Capitol. Their progress through the country was almost a continuous battle with bands of \"guerillas\" and bodies of Mexican soldiery who swarmed from the mountain fastnesses. In their encounters with the enemy the Michigan Volunteers acquitted themselves nobly, performing successfully and well every duty assigned them.\n\nThe war having been brought to a close in the summer of 1847, the regiment returned home, arriving at Detroit July 12th. At the outset Captain Greusel's Company numbered one hundred and five men, and he returned with eighty-five, having been better cared for and in better health than any of the other companies in the Regiment. Under his economical management about $300 Company money was saved, with which he purchased new shirts, shoes, blacking, and such articles of clothing and accoutrements as were lacking, and when within a few hours' ride from Detroit, directed his men to shave, wash, and dress in the new outfit provided for them. The other officers were astonished and somewhat chagrined to find that his company were clean and well dressed while theirs were walking bundles of dirty rags. On landing, Col. Williams placed Company D. in the advance in marching through the city; while the newspapers were filled with articles eulogistic of Captain Greusel and the fine appearance of his veteran company. The day succeeding his discharge and muster out of the service, found him back in his old position in the lumber yard of Rice, Coffin & Co., attending to business as of yore.\n\nSubsequently he was elected Captain of the City Guards and then Lieut. Colonel of the first battalion; was appointed Super-intendent\n\n16\n\nof the City Water Works in 1847, and Inspector General of lumber for the State of Michigan in 1848, which office he held two years. An unfortunate investment stripped him of the hard earnings of a life time, and he again commenced at the lowest round of the ladder of life to win his way to a competency and to fame. He next turned his attention to railroading and found continuous employment, first upon the Michigan Central and then the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, in whose employ the Rebellion found him. A company recruited by him at Aurora was among the first to respond to the President's call for troops, and on the organization of the 7th Regiment he was appointed its Major, where the opening chapter of our story finds him. His whole career is replete with incidents of indomitable perseverance, and triumphs over discouragements, indicating a determination to accomplish whatever he should undertake. It was quite generally conceded that in the appointment of a leader, the right man was found for the place.\n\nEDWARD S. JOSLYN, the Lieut. Colonel of the regiment, at this time was about thirty-four years of age. He was born in Nunda, Alleghany County, N. Y., but for the last twenty-five years had been a resident of Kane and McHenry counties. A lawyer by profession, his brilliant talents had won for him a high position at the bar. He was among the first who sprang to arms ere the thunders from Sumpter had ceased to reverberate through the land. He was appointed Captain of Company A of the first regiment formed in the State. Fearless and outspoken, none who knew him doubted his patriotism or courage. The whole regiment was devoted in their attachment to him, and confident that in the trials which awaited them he would acquit himself with honor and distinction.\n\n17\n\nChapter II. — Camp Hammond.\n\nPage Image\n\nAT FIRST the point selected for the place of rendezvous was on the east side of Fox River, in a grove opposite the village of Montgomery; but the owner of the land, with more selfishness than patriotism, would not allow the location of a camp on his premises without an exorbitant consideration. Another site was selected on the west side of the river, a half mile above Montgomery and two miles from Aurora, on high ground overlooking and adjoining the track of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. A fine spring of clear, cold water near at hand burst out from the foot of the bluff, and, with the exception of a forest shade, this location was fully as pleasant and far more dry and healthful than the proposed camp in the woods, and possessed the additional advantage of easy access to the railroad.\n\nCol. Hammond, the efficient Superintendent of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, took a warm interest in the organization and welfare of the regiment from its first inception, as was attested by the presentation of a fine flag-staff, from which gracefully waved the stars and stripes, doubly consecrated\n\n18\n\nin the affections of the men since the attempt of traitors to trample it in the dust. For this, as well as many other favors, were both officers and men under obligation to Col. Hammond, and it was in his honor that this first encampment was called \"Camp Hammond,\" which for many days was a point of absorbing interest to the good people of Kane and Kendall counties and of the surrounding region.\n\nThe Young America Guards arrived upon the ground Saturday, August 18th, 1861, being the first company in camp. They were a fine body of athletic men, as ready to grapple with the hardships of campaigning as to go to their accustomed duties in field or shop. They were commanded by Capt. E. B. Baldwin, and their quarters were selected, their tents arranged, and were apparently well settled for housekeeping on the arrival of the other companies.\n\nThe Bristol Company, from Kendall County, composed of recruits from the towns of Bristol and Little Rock, was next in the order of its arrival, and went into camp August 20th, Captain Baldwin and the Guards forming in line and according the men from Kendall County as gallant a reception as the circumstances would allow. This Company, composed almost exclusively of farmers' sons, was made up of as sterling material as ever wielded musket or sabre. The citizens of Bristol and neighborhood with commendable zeal turned out as to a political mass meeting to escort their boys to camp. Later in the day, Captain Pierce's Company from Lisbon, the \"Wayne Rifles,\" the \"Oswego Rifles.\" and the \"Elgin Guards\" put in an appearance, each preceded by the squeaking of fifes, the clangor of drums, the shout and hurrah of citizens, and accompanied by little less than a brigade of anxious mothers, staid and sober fathers, devoted wives, fidgety sisters and forlorn looking sweethearts.\n\n19\n\nBut this, like all days, had an end, and as the declining sun began to throw a halo of glory over camp and field, painful good byes were said, and many a mother's heart throbbed with sorrowing yet tender thoughts as she wended her way homeward. The men set to work with a will; tents went up as if by magic; a limited number of blankets were distributed; a meagre supply of straw procured for bedding; and rations, consisting of bread, beef, bacon and coffee, were issued to the men, who essayed, man fashion, to cook and eat their first meal in camp. The way some of the poor fellows went at it was a sight so supremely ludicrous as to excite the laughter of anything capable of appreciating superlative awkwardness. Some of the beef passed through the trying ordeal of cooking, much after the manner and as safely as those Israelitish worthies, Shadrach, Meshech and Abednego, passed through the fiery furnace, with little of the smell of fire about it, while the huge slices of others were shriveled and burned to a crisp; but whether raw or roasted, it finally went the way of all victuals, seasoned with some honest growls, but with few expressions of entire satisfaction.\n\nThis first night in camp will doubtless long be remembered by many. But few of the men had ever before experienced the luxury of a couch of straw, or the thrilling pleasure of reclining upon the bare bosom of Mother Earth, with a coat, a carpet sack or block of wood to serve as a pillow. To some, with whom the experiment was wholly new, the long hours of the night wore away dull and melancholy. Notwithstanding the scores of people in close proximity to them, it seemed lonely with but a thin sheet of cotton cloth between them and the great blue sky, flecked with stars, arching around and over them. Some were thinking of the homes they had just left, and many were the\n\n20\n\ntender thoughts and loving wishes that were wafted thitherward. But the few who lay down to quiet rest and pleasant dreams were cruelly defrauded out of so laudable a purpose by the many who, unrestrained, gave full vent to their joyous hilarity and ceaseless mischief, deluging the camp with fun and noises the most hideous and unearthly, as if a new Pandemonium had at once broken loose. At times, profound silence would reign throughout the camp for the lengthened period of a minute and a-half, when some \"rough\" from an obscure corner would give a tremendous \"Baa!\" Another from an adjoining tent would respond, then the chorus would be taken up along the line of tents from all parts of camp, and in ten seconds from the first yelp the whole crowd would be \"baaing\" with the force of a thousand calf power.\n\nAgain the lonely bark of a dog, faintly heard from some distant farm-house, would start some human hound or poodle in camp to bark response, and then the whole pack would take up the refrain until they had barked themselves hoarse. Then there were cat voices, sheep voices, turkey gobblings and cock crowings ad libitum. So it went until daylight. But few slept, some laughed a very little, others swore a very great deal, and thus the night wore away.\n\nOn the 22d three more companies arrived. In the afternoon, Captain Webb, a United States mustering officer, appeared and administered the following oath to the companies then in camp\n\n\"I do solemnly swear that I will bear true allegiance to the United States of America. That I will serve them honestly and faithfully against all enemies and opposers whatever. That I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and all officers appointed over me, according to the rules of the Army of the United States, so help me God!\"\n\nBefore the oath was administered the men were drawn up in line of companies in their respective quarters, and after baring\n\n21\n\ntheir heads, each right hand went eagerly up, and at its conclusion many fervently joined the solemn invocation, \"So help me God!\" It was a grand sight to see company after company with hands uplifted to heaven solemnly consecrate themselves to the protection and preservation of the country. No cat squalls or cock crowing then. This was casting the die in which their honor, their all, even life itself was at stake. The company from Newark arrived at Aurora in the 4 p. m. train, and were deployed in line upon the platform of the railroad station, and the same oath administered before proceeding to camp.\n\nBefore the week had expired, every company, comprising ten of infantry and two of cavalry, were on the ground diligently at work drilling and \"preserving rations,\" which were supplied in bountiful abundance, at which all acquired commendable proficiency.\n\nThe company from Elgin was particularly admired for the soldierly bearing and generally fine appearance of the men. Though, as raw material, not excelling many of the others, yet they had been upon the parade ground before under the supervision of an officer read up in \"Hardee,\" and were comparatively well drilled, and had already acquired that stiffness of vertebra which the others had yet to learn. They were likewise partly armed and uniformed, not very uniformly, 'tis true, but with enough of the soldier's paraphernalia mingled with \"store clothes\" and citizen's gear to inspire awe and attract attention. One or two, whose limbs sported in the ample folds of the red legged \"Zoo Zoo,\" were special objects of curiosity. Their arms were old fashioned and rusty muskets, a sort of a cross between a cannon and liberty pole, that had been plundered from the armory of some half disbanded or wholly defunct militia company that once had a butterfly existence somewhere within\n\n22\n\nthe bounds of Kane County, and which they came lugging into camp very much after the fashion a person would carry a fence rail or crowbar. These blunderbusses excited intense disgust in the minds of the raw recruits, who had been fondly dreaming of Sharp's or Henry rifles with sabre bayonets. And it was quite generally remarked that if these were a sample of what was to be our armament, our arrival in Dixie would be hailed with delight by the \"Johnnie Rebs,\" as the only parties who would be in any kind of danger would be those who unfortunately happened to be placed behind them, for it was reported and believed by some that those guns would kick further than they would shoot, and were infinitely more dangerous to friend than foe.\n\nTo insure promptness in the delivery of supplies of food, clothing, camp equipage and necessary stores, and to see that there was no lack either in quality or quantity, required Colonel Greusel's personal attention, and for a few days he was necessarily absent a part of the time. With no instructions and few correct ideas how the thing should be done, the work of arranging tents as they should be was only accomplished after infinite difficulty and innumerable failures. At first tents were scattered promiscuously over the prairie as if shot out of a siege gun or pitched together with a hay fork. But the Colonel suddenly terminated this unmilitary jumble by referring us to Hardee for full instructions in the mysteries of camp arrangement. The tents were again taken down and put up as directed by that fascinating writer, in which position they remained as long as Camp Hammond was occupied. It may seem strange that so brilliant an idea had not flashed across our benighted understandings at an earlier stage of camp life, for some of the companies had taken down their tents and re-arranged them at least a half dozen\n\n23\n\ntimes before a satisfactory result was obtained. The habitations provided were square wall tents, large and airy, and in marked contrast to the dog kennels which succeeded their demise. They numbered more than one hundred and fifty, and when finally arranged presented a romantic appearance, like some well laid out rural village, with pointed gables and whitewashed cottages, nestling like a flock of swans upon the green prairie.\n\nThe details of camp life were full of interest to the men. The new uniforms which the officers began to don, the evolutions of a thousand men on drill or parade, the silvery music of the band at reveille or tattoo borne upon the stillness of the evening air, were all calculated to make them fall in love with a vocation apparently so full of varied charms. After a time the incessant drill, and standing guard beneath a broiling sun or in a drenching rain storm, washing greasy dishes, scouring rusty knives, cooking and eating stale beef, and at night wallowing down to sleep ten in a tent — these and a hundred other like enjoyments, pretty effectually in after times took the romance out of camp life and left it, like many other of the more laborious duties, a very plain, drudging and stupid reality. But this was not fully realized at Camp Hammond. Only the bright side of the picture with its roseate tints were contemplated. Every day brought with it some fresh excitement, some pleasant amusement, some substantial and touching evidence of the wealth of affection lavished upon the men by loving friends or doting parents at home.\n\nOne source of fun, however, occurred occasionally from attempts to \"run the guard.\" Absences from roll call were not unfrequent, and several drunks and disorderlies had been reported and disposed of not in accordance with the \"statutes of William and Mary,\" when stringent orders were issued to allow no\n\n24\n\nsoldier to pass out of camp except at the gate near the guard tent, and not then without a pass from head-quarters. To enforce this order a cordon of guards were placed at short intervals around the whole camp, armed and equipped with the guns brought from Elgin. Now and then some untamed specimen of the genus homo, impatient of restraint, would watch a favorable opportunity when the sentinel's back was turned, quietly slip down into the gravel pit, and hugging closely its precipitous and protecting sides, walk off undiscovered; or, if discovered and called back, instead of heeding the call, would break for some cornfield. The sentinel shouted for the \"Corporal of the Guard,\" when that important functionary, with two or three privates, whose pride and official standing were involved in the result, seized their muskets and were away in hot pursuit. Through the gravel pit and across the fields went pursuers and pursued, until, after a long and exciting chase, they overhauled the culprit, and bringing him triumphantly back to camp, dumped him into the litter and dirt of the guard tent. Some ran the gauntlet successfully, and for a while enjoyed the sweets of stolen liberty. The announcement that the guards would be supplied with ball cartridges at length put a stop to this species of fun, for those disposed to participate in it began to realize that a two ounce slug of lead in pursuit of a man was quite a different affair from being chased by a heavy-sided, ungainly recruit, depending solely upon suppleness of limb and length of breath for success. Some of the fellows thus caught were put in charge of a guard, and were observed sweeping and otherwise clearing up the parade ground, looking very sheepish the while.\n\nThis species of fun being suppressed, Hiram, of Big Hock, in lieu of it opened a boxing gymnasium. This, with base ball, filled up the intervals between meal time and drill. At night,\n\n25\n\nthe \"Star Spangled Banner,\" the \"Red, White and Blue,\" rang out clear and sweet from the throats of a glee club made up from the members of the Morris Company, who almost every evening favored us with well sung and spirited choruses. Thanks for music in an encampment of soldiers — it is the crucible in which a thousand diversities of taste, purpose and ambition are fused to man's infinite advantage, harmonizing petty jealousies, assimilating diverse sentiments, forming and cementing friendships which would never have been effected by any other process. Besides the glee club, there were plenty of other musical aspirants who sang in good English and bad English, in Dutch, Chinese, and other dialects too numerous to mention. In other portions of the camp would be heard the grinding squeal of a fiddle, shrill and sharp as a rapier, around which a quadrille would be quickly extemporized, and numbers whirled in the giddy mazes of the dance. Then came jokes, both fresh and stale, and \"sells\" and stories ad infinitum.\n\nThe utmost cleanliness existed throughout the camp. Liquor was prohibited, by order of the Colonel, which will everlastingly redound to his honor and credit; and every precaution was taken to insure the health of the men.\n\nFood was abundant, and in many instances the regular allowance was increased by contributions from the well stored larders and productions from the fields of the large-hearted farmers of the country. Scarcely a day passed in which there were not heavily laden wagons driven into the quarters, with potatoes, squashes, onions, fruits and vegetables, butter, eggs, milk, &c., &c. — substantial evidences of the generous and patriotic impulses of the citizens of the surrounding region. The \"Young America Guards,\" who were at too great a distance from home to be often remembered by their friends, generally had a good time\n\n26\n\nwatching with watery mouths all such arrivals; but not long had they to watch and wait, for selfishness was a trait of character not often indulged in by the men, and generally all shared equally in the good things showered upon us; in fact, all the companies \"lived high\" while at Camp Hammond.\n\nThe military duties at Camp Hammond were about the same each day, excepting that the lines were gradually drawn closer, and more strictness and severity of discipline observed. To give the details of one day would answer for a week, a month, or a whole campaign. At five o'clock A. M., when the first blushes of the early morning were stealing up and over the heavens, and the eastern sky was glowing with tints of purple and gold, and at a time when the aches and pains, the joys and sorrows of the men were forgotten in deep and refreshing slumbers, and when each tent was musical with a duet of unearthly snores, was sounded the \"drummers' call,\" a signal for the drummers to assemble, fifteen minutes thereafter, and perform a fife and sheep skin chorus, called reveille, which consisted, simply, of a half dozen tunes played up and down the parade ground, and along the line of tents. This was the signal for sleepy and sleeping soldiers to cease snoring, come out from Dreamland, pick the straws from their hair, carefully fold their blankets, don their wardrobe and generally awaken to active life. Those detailed for that purpose set about preparing breakfast, while, as an appetizer, the balance of the Company were divided into squads, and under charge of Sergeants, marched to the parade ground, and put through all the evolutions laid down by Hardee or Hoyle, or prescribed by the U.S. Regulations. When breakfast was announced, a double quick to the tables and a charge upon the viands smoking from the pot, and the day's work was fairly inaugurated.\n\n27\n\nAt six o'clock A. M. was \"Police Call,\" at which every straw, chicken bone, hen's feather, quid of tobacco, scrap of paper, &c., &c., were gathered up and carried beyond the confines of the camp. At seven o'clock was another drum beat, called the \"Surgeon's Call,\" at which all the sick, lame and lazy were marched to the surgeon's quarters for examination and treatment for their varied ailments. At half-past seven o'clock another rub-a-dub-dub diffused the information that it was time for drill, when at it they went, tramp, tramp, march, march, rush, rush, from two to four hours, as if their very salvation was depending on it, when seething, sweating and panting they were marched to their quarters and allowed a brief interval to cool off.\n\nAt nine o'clock was guard mounting, when the new guards, made up of squads detailed for that purpose from each company, proceeded to head-quarters, and after being inspected, divided into reliefs numbered One, Two and Three, and receiving their orders, proceeded to relieve the guards of the previous twenty-four hours. The post of each sentinel or guard was numbered, and if disorders or violations of military etiquette occurred which required regulating, near any particular station, the sentinel at that post called for the \"Corporal of the Guard,\" adding the number of the post, which call, after being passed from post to post, and repeated by each successive sentinel, reached the guard tent, when a Corporal and file of men, known as a \"Corporal's Guard,\" seized their arms, rushed to the point of danger or from whence the call proceeded. Guard duty became not only exceedingly wearisome, but was very generally regarded as an intolerable nuisance.\n\nAt twelve o'clock was \"Dinner Call,\" the most welcome and the most eagerly responded to of any of the almost innumerable calls which were squeaked and pounded out of the bowels of fife\n\n28\n\nand drum. A bevy of country lasses, generally young and handsome, were usually on hand to share the noonday meal, but none of them were very heavy gormandizers of baked beans, fried pork, muddy coffee and bread without butter. \"My sakes!\" says one, \"No cream for your coffee? How can you drink it? Why does the Government subject its soldiers to such privations?\" And when the shocking fact was made known that the \"boys \" were not even provided with ice cream, sponge cake, \"blanc mange,\" and a hundred other like articles, their horror at the \"hardships\" and \"deprivations\" to which the \"poor boys\" were subjected, knew no bounds.\n\nAt six o'clock in the afternoon was \"Assembly,\" at the sound of which each company fell into line, in front of camp. And then came the most prominent feature of the day, \"Dress Parade,\" when the whole regiment was drawn up in line, numbering at least one thousand men, making a very fine appearance. The band played a march and quickstep along the line and back again, and then they were marshalled by Adjutant Willis and turned over to the Colonel, who put them through a series of postures and facings; after which the Orderly Sergeants marched to the front and reported. Then the commissioned officers proceeded to the center; faced to the front; proceeded in line to the Colonel; saluted him; were either complimented or criticised, and then dismissed; while the different companies were marched to their quarters by the Orderlies.\n\nAt nine P. M., while the camp was bubbling over with mirth, song and story, and all seemed to be in a furor of discordant conversation and laughter, was heard \"Tattoo,\" the finest effort of music during the day, consisting of a wild outburst or medley of several pieces played by the full band, which had a peculiarly magnificent and exhilarating effect in combination with the darkness\n\n29\n\nand solemnities of the night. This was succeeded by roll call, and then the men were expected to go to their quarters; and at \"taps,\" which consisted of a few beats of the drum at the head of each company quarters, lights were extinguished. The hum of voices gradually subsided as one and another retired to rest, closing their eyes in brief oblivion of the world, its cares, its toils, its joys and sorrows. Thus were the duties incident to camp life performed with the regularity and certainty of a clock.\n\nAbout the most important personage at Camp Hammond was that ubiquitous dignitary known as the \"Corporal of the Guard,\" before whom the ordinary \"high private\" might be considered as a mere serf kneeling before his imperial footstool. It was perfectly astonishing how high a little brief authority raised some men in their own estimation. When in the course of human events these great men condescended to perform their share of the duties pertaining to camp, their dignified air and tone of authority at once proclaimed a consciousness of their own importance. One would think, to see them blustering and domineering through camp, that not only the existence of the Regiment, but the eternal welfare of the country depended upon them alone, and that their creation was the only work of any consequence performed by an all-wise and beneficent Creator. No men in any other position, if they should try a lifetime, could succeed so well in making donkeys of themselves.\n\nAt length, after days and weeks of anxious watching and weary waiting, the uniforms arrived on the 23d of September. \"Fall in, men,\" was the Captain's order, which was quickly responded to. Each company being formed in line before that officer's tent, the roll was called, and each man in response to name went forward and soon returned with drawers, pants, coat and cap hanging on his arm, and looking proud over his\n\n30\n\nnewly acquired treasures. In expectation of the speedy arrival of the regulation blue, the men had left their \"store clothes\" at home, and had come to camp with their half worn out toggery, thinking there would be a speedy change for other and more appropriate costumes; but a strike among seamstresses or other unavoidable circumstances caused delay, until many had become fit material for scarecrows, and the whole outfit in the matter of clothing had become a burlesque upon neatness and gentility. But after these caricature representation of clothes had been shucked, and each man had donned a brand new uniform, the transformation was so complete that one would scarcely recognize his neighbor or bunk-mate; while the piles of scraps, shreds, cast-off rags, and the mountains of old hats, caps, boots and shoes which graced the grounds were perfectly astonishing.\n\nThe new uniforms fitted admirably, excepting say fifty or sixty to a company. Here would be seen a tall, lank, ungainly man, as slim as a whipstalk, the unhappy possessor of a pair of unmentionables as loose and baggy as a gunny-sack — large enough for Daniel Lambert, and what was still more remarkable, the excess expended in breadth of beam was lacking in length, and when once enveloping its ungainly possessor, several inches, more or less, of naked legs would be discovered protruding from below the voluminous folds of cloth. Some of the shorter ones were able to button their waistbands around their necks, and then have from six inches to a foot of cloth to spare at the bottoms; but this defect was easily remedied by rolling them up or chopping them off with a broadaxe. The pockets of some were too shallow to hold a jack-knife, while others were so deep as to suggest the idea of taking off the pants entirely to enable one to reach the bottom, and large enough to hold a blanket, a shirt,\n\n31\n\nor even a side of bacon, if necessary. Some were so tight as to suggest cholera morbus or heaves.\n\nThe coats fitted beautifully, almost as well, in fact, as the pants. A third of them were too large around the waist; as many were too small around the chest; but then these slight drawbacks admirably offset each other. The collars of some were but a trifle above the small of the wearer's back, while the collars of others were several inches above the heads of their owners. The sleeves, too, had here and there a fault. Some were so tight under the arms as to nearly lift the possessor from the ground; others large enough for a small sized boy to crawl through; as for length, some did not stop until the distance of several inches beyond the tips of the fingers had been attained, while the career of others terminated at or near the elbows. With these trifling exceptions the uniforms fitted admirably, and the men were universally pleased as well as proud at the change from jeans and satinets to the garb of soldiers of the United States of America.\n\nThe early autumn days were soft and mellow, with just enough haze to give the sky a dreamy appearance, and the weather was generally even tempered. Now and then the rays of the sun poured down with a fierceness which rendered the performance of camp duties anything but a pleasant recreation. Not always, however, were the days bright and the breezes balmy. For instance, on the afternoon of September 1st, a rain storm, accompanied with heavy thunder and wind, swept the camp. The tents flapped and swayed before the blast and the men expected every moment to see their canvas roofs go flying over the prairie, but for two hours they stood the test and not a man received a wetting. At sunset the dense clouds had passed over and gathered in the east, while patches of clear sky betokened that\n\n32\n\nthis storm was over. But in the west another black cloud arose in heavy masses. The faint gleams of lightning illuminating the deep recesses of the clouds, together with the unusual stillness in the air, told of another and severer storm about to burst upon us. It came at length, and at midnight the wind was shrieking among the tents and the water poured down in resistless fury. The rain drove through the canvas as though it were fish nets or mosquito bars, and men awoke from dreams of home and other luxuries to find themselves wetter than if they had just emerged from the neighboring mill pond. Here and there a tent would careen and then tumble in dripping ruins about the heads of the amazed inmates, who, in inordinate haste, gathered up what could be found of their scattered wardrobe and fled in their scanty apparel to other and safer quarters. The wind soon was over, but the rain continued to fall in torrents. The poor sentinels experienced all its fury. Imagine one in all the loneliness of such a night, plunging blindly through the savage storm, staggering into some muddy rut or hollow and breasting a blast of wind nearly sufficient in force to blow an iron siege gun or an elephant into space.\n\nIn the morning eight tents were in ruins, others shattered, and the ground plastered with mud anywhere from three inches to three feet in depth. The Colonel's quarters, as the printer would have it, were badly \"pied,\" flattened in the mud and bountifully sprinkled with the blackest prairie soil. A detail of men took it to the river and attempted to wash it, but that Head-quarters tent never after assumed the white and spotless purity of its primeval state. Then there were other days, when\n\n\"There was a gloom on the sky, and its shadow\n\nLay chill on the morning's pure breast;\n\nWhen the sunshine was hid from the meadows,\n\nAnd nature with tears was oppressed.\"\n\n33\n\nWhen the clouds would shed their tear drops as if in mourning, from morning till night, and during the succeeding hours of darkness the unceasing drizzle would continue its sonorous patter upon the tent flies.\n\nThe Companies all received superb treatment from their friends at home. Almost every day they were the recipients of bounteous favors; were \"wined,\" dined, and pic-nicked to an extent never experienced before. Calico, muslins, ribbons and parasols gleamed like wild flowers hither and thither in ever thronging numbers to greet their soldier friends. At one time eleven passenger coaches, filled to repletion with people from Elgin and Woodstock, came down to see and feast their brave boys in the tented field, and as a token of their regard and an evidence of good sense they brought along huge baskets and boxes of all the good things their ingenuity could invent or their pantries yield. Truly did they appreciate the fact that the avenue to a soldier's heart ran through his stomach, and as the Regimental rhymer has it:\n\n\"'Tis a curious thing that people should cram\n\nMutton and beef, chicken and ham,\n\nCake, salmon, salad, pickles and dace,\n\nAll through a hole in the front of the face.\"\n\nNever went up cheers more hearty and blessings more benign than were showered upon the good dames of Elgin when the boys caught sight of that dinner.\n\nThe \"Young Americas\" were also pic-nicked, by the ladies of Montgomery and Bristol providing a feast of fat things, in a beautiful grove east of the village. The \"Guards,\" and a throng of invited guests, fell into line and marched three-quarters of a mile to the tables, which were loaded down with every substantial and delicacy known to the season, presenting a scene of magnificence rivaling the famed and fabled feasts of the gods.\n\n34\n\nGroups of ladies, the grace, goodness and beauty of the place, detailed for that purpose, were at each table to wait on the soldiers, which pleasing duty they did in a style satisfactory in the highest degree. After hundreds had filled their inordinate capacities almost too full for utterance, there was still enough food left to feed as many more. \"May heaven strew their paths with blessings,\" was the universal benison accorded these fair hostesses, as the men retired with grateful hearts and in good order from the contest.\n\nAn unfortunate difference arose between Colonel Greusel and Lieut. Walker, of the \"Oswego Rifles.\" This Company was among the first upon the ground, and had largely been recruited through the efforts of Walker. Its Captain, S. C. Camp, a lawyer by profession, was better versed in Blackstone than Hardee, and much of the drilling of the men and more laborious duties devolved upon Lieut. Walker. An auctioneer by profession, he could not readily divest himself of his buying and selling ways of life, and his duties were performed in \"just a going, gentlemen, — going — going — gone\" sort of a way, exciting the laughter of some and the disgust of others. About this time, O. B. Merrill, a member of the 13th Regiment, then on duty in Missouri, came to Aurora on a furlough. His brief military experience, in the opinion of some, had eminently fitted him for promotion, and he sought a commission in the Fox River Regiment. And here let us remark, what a great pity it is that some plan was not devised whereby all enlisted men could be made Brigadiers, Colonels, or at least something that wore shoulder straps. Such a plan, it must be readily perceived, would have resulted in the most delightful harmony and efficiency of an army, beside being particularly gratifying to the vanity of a majority of the men.\n\n35\n\nTo give Merrill a place among the officers, a vacancy was necessary, and as in the recruiting of the 36th the offices were most eagerly sought after and soonest filled, unfortunately such vacancy did not exist. The Surgeon was called upon to decide the physical qualifications of candidates for official honors. Walker was alone found wanting, and thereupon rejected, when Merrill at once succeeded to the position. This arrangement was not at all satisfactory to Walker, who strenuously objected to being so summarily disposed of; for, however much he delighted in auctioneering off the goods, chattels and wares of others, the rule when applied to himself was not so delightful, and he entered his protest against such a going — going — gone procedure. Walker hastened to Chicago and was examined by other medical magnates, who pronounced him physically sound, or at least sound enough for the performance of military duty.\n\nIn the meantime Major Brackett had mustered the whole Regiment and accepted it for service, including O. B. Merrill as Lieutenant of Co. I., and on Walker's return to camp, backed by his medical certificate, he found Lieut. Merrill fully installed and in the performance of the duties of the much coveted position. Walker claimed his position of 1st Lieutenant and demanded his reinstatement and recognition as such. The Colonel was in a towering rage, and ordered Walker to leave the camp instantly, and set about measures to enforce the order; whereupon Walker, thinking discretion the better part of valor, went. We would gladly strike this page from our story, but, as an impartial historian, there is no other resource than to treat the good and bad alike. This is our apology for giving details of an occurrence which, more than all other causes combined, carried with it the seeds of acrimony and dissension.\n\n36\n\nIt cannot be denied that for one reason or another a great many \"poor sticks\" managed at the outset to get into positions, for which they were in a greater or less degree unfitted. Many a Company, and Regiment even, made up of most excellent material, have been rendered comparatively useless by having at its head an inefficient leader. If there was one lesson well learned during the first years of the war, it was the absolute necessity of having men for officers! Men, in the broad sense of the term, who had some respect for themselves as well as for others. Men to stand firm, self-possessed, elevated and strengthened by a high sense of honor, of patriotic duty to their country, to their subordinates, and to the cause in which they were engaged. Imagine a whining incapable, leading a body of men upon a desperate bayonet charge!\n\nThe very first element of success and of discipline is the respect of men for their officers, and only true men can thus command their respect. Let such a one be found and the rest becomes easy, whether he is wanted for a General, a Colonel or a Lieutenant. The 13th Regiment, or even West Point with all its training in camp or field, could not manufacture first-rate officers if the indispensible ingredients of self-respect, honor, temperance, manliness and reserved force of character are lacking. When war and battles are resorted to in the settlement of difficulties, it should be no child's play, but the desperate exercise of all the higher qualities of manhood; for unless troops are under the control of true men, defeat is inevitable.\n\nOn the 12th of September Col. Brackett appeared, and in his official capacity as United States Mustering Officer, inspected and mustered the Regiment as a whole. Each Company in single file was slowly marched between a Board of Surgeons and if a limp was detected or a man wore a cadaverous cast of\n\n37\n\ncountenance, he was requested to stand aside and afterwards subjected to an ante mortem Coroner's inquest, called Medical Examination. A few were rejected, and, notwithstanding their protestations of general good health and appeals to remain, they were obliged to take up their traps and walk. The examination over, the oath was administered to the whole Regiment, which was for the first time designated the THIRTY-SIXTH, and as such was booked for three years' service in the employ of that stupendous individual, Uncle Sam.\n\nA few refused to be sworn in and comply with the conditions attached to the service; whereupon Col. Joslyn jerked them out of the ranks, and presenting each a note of hand with the toe of his boot, sent them howling beyond the confines of camp — a mode of mustering out not laid down in the books, and calculated to awaken a remembrance of so lively an event to the latest hours of life. Among these were two Germans from Co. E., whose courage oozing out at this supreme moment, they refused to take the prescribed oath. They were followed a half mile from camp by half a hundred madly excited men and remorselessly kicked and hustled about, and as a parting token of remembrance a horse whip was unmercifully administered to their backs. Their piteous cries for mercy awakened but little sympathy from their late and now infuriated comrades.\n\n38\n\nChapter III. — Roster of the Regiment.\n\nPage Image\n\nFOLLOWING is the Roster of the 36th Regiment, on its final muster and acceptance into the service of the United States, and at the period of its departure from Camp Hammond to Missouri.\n\nNICHOLAS GREUSEL, Colonel.

Before day the men were astir, the camp alive and buzzing like a huge beehive. Hurrahs would break out from some unexpected quarter, which were followed by scattering hurrahs all over camp. Animation beamed from every countenance, and soon after sunrise people from the country came crowding into the camp by the thousand. They came on foot, on horseback, and in every conceivable kind of vehicle from a lumber wagon to a chaise. Gaily dressed women, fair-faced country lasses, hardy countrymen, over-dressed fops and substantial farmers, making up a \"tremendous big crowd,\" were on hand, rendering the scene animated and picturesque beyond description. A larger assemblage never before gathered on the banks of the glistening Fox; and never went soldiers to fields of glory bearing kinder wishes for their welfare, or more heartfelt adieus at their departure. Eyes unused to weeping were dimmed with mistiness, and hearts throbbed heavily with painful thoughts as the order was given to strike tents, and\n\n56\n\nin ten minutes the prairie which had been flecked with snowy canvass was littered with heaps of straw, old clothes, hats, bundles of rags, fire places, boards and ruined bunks.\n\nAt 4 P. M. the column was formed, and headed by the band, we bade adieu to Camp Hammond forever; marched to Aurora and embarked in a long train of passenger coaches which awaited us, and amidst the deafening shout of thousands the train moved away. Scarcely a sad face was seen in the regiment, and if flashing eyes and loud huzzahs were an index of the feelings within, all departed with joy and gladness. On the line of railroad our departure had been heralded in advance, and it seemed as if the whole population were out, lining the track to bid us God speed. Bonfires blazed, guns were fired, and the evening air was stirred with shouting as we passed swiftly through the villages which dotted the country. At Arlington, in Bureau County, where we stopped a few minutes for water, crowds of ladies flocked to the train to welcome and shake the hands of their gallant defenders. At Galesburg the citizens thronged the station, and were profuse in complimenting the fine appearance of the men. A group of cavalrymen, with Major Barry in their midst, while standing on the platform at the depot with their overcoats and clean uniforms on, attracted the attention of a citizen, who remarked, while looking at the squad, \"They have a fine looking set of field officers.\" Whether the Major alone appropriated the compliment, or regarded it as a drive at the officers, was not ascertained. We reached Quincy at 3 P. M. September 25th, and soon the work of transferring cavalry horses, tents and regimental stores to the steamer Warsaw commenced. Those of the men not detailed for that purpose found quarters in an empty warehouse; many, however, remained in the cars, and doubling up like jack-knives, sought repose in the seats.\n\n57\n\nA thousand or more of Mulligan's men had arrived at Quincy from their defeat at Lexington, and each had his story of adventures, of hardship and suffering to tell. They were a brawny set of Irishmen, who had fought well and deserved much of their country, which up to that time had paid them nothing. As our destination was Missouri, and the probabilities were that we would have the same enemy upon our hands, some pains were taken to ascertain the character and numbers of the rebels, and the particulars of the late battle at Lexington.\n\nPrevious to September a small force of the 1st Illinois Cavalry and a body of Home Guards had been posted at Lexington to protect the Union people of that place. This force being menaced by superior numbers, Col. Mulligan was dispatched from Jefferson City with his regiment as a reinforcement, marching a distance of 150 miles on foot. Entrenchments were thrown up around the Masonic college building, which served as a magazine and storehouse. The Union forces at this time numbered 2500 men. The next day the enemy's advance, 6,000 strong, under Gen. Rains, made their appearance. Col. Mulligan, finding himself threatened by a greatly superior force, sent urgently for reinforcements, while the command speedily set to work with pick and shovel to strengthen their defences. On the 12th of September the siege began. By the 17th the enemy were in force and had entirely surrounded Mulligan's position with 20,000 men. The battle continued night and day with both cannon and musketry, but every charge was repulsed with heavy loss to the enemy. At length they constructed breast works of hemp bales, from behind which they kept up a continuous fire while rolling them towards the federal position. Sorties were made upon these works and the enemy driven away, but lacking sufficient support to hold them the advantages gained were temporary. During one of these\n\n58\n\ncharges Col. Mulligan was wounded and Col. White, of the 1st Illinois Cavalry, killed. Upon the death of Col. White a panic seized the Home Guards, who, without orders, raised a flag of truce, which Col. Mulligan caused to be torn down, and the combat continued. At length the ammunition having given out, and the men being completely exhausted, the Home Guards again raised a white flag, which this time was not torn down. Terms of surrender were agreed upon, the men were paroled and permitted to proceed to Quincy. Everything except clothing and officers' side arms were given up. Col. Mulligan wept when he found he must abandon a contest which he had gallantly maintained for eight days. Gen. Price complimented the command by saying that \"these Irishmen were the hardest set to capture he had ever seen,\" and certainly their looks in this respect did not belie them. Many of these men were ready to violate their parol, and proceeded to St. Louis with us, persisting in their determination to join our command and fight the \"rebs\" on sight.\n\nThe next morning all the men and equipage were transferred to the Warsaw, and as she steamed out into the river, turned her prow from the city and went cutting the spray southward, a thousand cheers were interchanged between boat and shore. The shrill notes of the band and loud beating of drums echoed from the woody banks — and from each negro cabin a shout went up and a fluttering handkerchief or apron waved us a kind God speed. But two nights' and a day's absence from home had afforded ample time for a little of the enthusiasm to cool, and when the men began to realize that they were dissevered from old familiar land marks, it might be for months — possibly, alas, forever! many faces were measurably lengthened, contrasting strangely with the animation of the day before. At night the\n\n59\n\ntwinkling stars were suggestive of sad thoughts; even the notes from the band became mournful as a funeral dirge, and its strains seemed to echo only tearful and melancholy farewells. Some eyes were observed terribly red — resulting from the wind, of course.\n\nThe trip was made with scarcely a stop, except when stranded on a sand bar, where for twenty minutes the men were kept on a double quick from bow to stern until the craft worked its way over and was again cleaving the waves. No incident worthy of record occurred to those on board, but everybody on shore, as we rapidly steamed by, came out and gazed at the great steamer plowing through the water, crowded with 1,200 soldiers, who swarmed from texas to boiler deck. The men were generally in good spirits, and but few complained of illness until it became known that the sick were to occupy the cabin, when an epidemic for state rooms suddenly broke out, and Surgeon Young was much surprised at the numbers responding at sick call, all requiring immediate attention and removal to the cabin.\n\nDaylight on the morning of the 27th found us safely moored at a landing in front of the city of St. Louis. Col. Greusel immediately proceeded to the headquarters of Gen. Fremont, reported the arrival of the Regiment, and asked for arms. His requisition was at once granted, and at 9 o'clock A. M. the Warsaw dropped down to the United States Arsenal. Arrived within its stone walls, arms and accoutrements were quickly distributed. Companies A and B were fortunate in securing Minnie and Enfield rifles, while Springfield muskets of an old pattern, remodeled, were dealt out to the balance of the Regiment. The Colonel was indignant, the men were disappointed, but no amount of expostulation could secure different arms, from the simple fact that they were not to be had.\n\n60\n\nLieut. Clark, who by unanimous consent had been appointed regimental wag, was heard discoursing thus: \"Heaven forgive us all our sins if we are to be sent among these rampageous, half horse, half alligator, border ruffians with these old muskets and triangular bayonets. If we are not kicked over the borders at the first discharge it will be through the special interposition of a kind Providence. Or it will be through the same merciful influence if we are not all dead in three weeks from lugging so much rusty iron among the black jacks and rocky fastnesses of Missouri. We shall be equally in danger from the muzzles of squirrel rifles and the breeches of our own muskets; and caught thus like a rat in a trap between muzzle and breech, what possible earthly chance can there be for us?\"\n\nWhen the \"Wayne Rifles\" were humorously requested to walk up and take their muskets, with a look of injured innocence they peremptorily refused, and left the arsenal grounds in a huff and without a single gun. Re-embarked upon the Warsaw we steamed back to the city and passed another night upon the boat. A train of freight cars were shoved down to the levee to which the regimental stores were transferred, and at about 5 P. M. the Regiment was marched through the city with rattling drums and colors flying, to the depot of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, where we embarked for Rolla, then the terminus of the Southwestern Branch. There being no equipments nor sufficient transportation for the cavalry, they were sent to Benton Barracks, a beautiful location north-west of the city limits, where at that time 10,000 men were under the military instruction of Gen. Curtis, who was in command.\n\nAfter eight of the infantry companies had taken their places in the cars, word came from the railroad officials that, for lack of transportation, two of the companies would be obliged to remain\n\n61\n\nin St. Louis until the next day. Preparations were being made to proceed in accordance with this arrangement, when Col. Joslyn, having ascertained that there were cars enough upon the tracks, concluded that the two cavalry companies were enough to leave at that time, and proceeding to the engine, pulled the pin connecting it with the train, and with revolver in hand declared the train should not leave St. Louis until cars sufficient for the transportation of the infantry were furnished. The altercation became rather boisterous, and one of the railroad men threatened to thrash him. The Colonel doubted his ability to make the threat good, and reiterated the demand for more cars, which, after some delay, were forthcoming — the plucky Lieut. Colonel of the Thirty-sixth coining off victorious in the first campaign in Missouri.\n\nAt Franklin we were switched on the South-west Branch, over which we ran at little more than cart horse speed, affording abundant opportunity to speculate upon the dangers and trials of the future and wonder what fate had in reserve for us. The South-west Branch cannot easily be forgotten by those who in war times had the excruciating pleasure of riding over it. The men were penned in box cars like drovers' stock on its way to the slaughter pen. Every foot of space was occupied, and there was not a square inch of muscle that was not as tender as an ulcerated tooth at the termination of that ride. Passing through a rough, almost mountainous region, with its frequent intervals of steep grades, to a nervous man the speed was painfully slow; but when the heights were gained, and the down grades reached, a rate of speed was at times attained calculated to lead to the suspicion that at that rate and over such a track we would soon be landed in a country of sultry climate, where secession had its birthplace and where, we hoped, it was destined\n\n62\n\nsoon to have its burial. Then we would go up, up, winding around mountain gorges until one would have to watch the trees closely to determine if we moved at all.\n\nThe hills were usually covered with low, scrubby black jack; the soil for the most part poor and thin, and scarcely worth the blood already shed in its defense. With an occasional clearing, comprising a few acres of sickly weeds, a log cabin with mud chimneys entirely outside, with now and then a dilapidated \"butternut;\" a smoke begrimmed, dejected woman and a swarm of half-clothed urchins, with unkempt, yellow heads protruding through the chinks, watching, with a vacant stare, the passing train, served to fill up the details of this picture of the region passed through. The bulk of native Missourians we saw were long, gaunt men and women, put together well enough, perhaps, originally, but now quite shaken to pieces with fever and ague, or trembling with terror and apprehension, in view of the speedy occupation of the country by federal troops and retribution which might at any time overtake them for participation in rebellion. As a rule, the houses of the country were small, dirty and dilapidated; each establishment worthy of its proprietor. Of thrift, comfort, and good farming, we saw none; the people barely existed — did not live. One meets many just such dwellings and just such people over the South. Men who lie around loose rather than stand erect on God's green earth; men who seem to have no heritage of ideas or manly aspirations, but manage in a very precarious way to keep body and soul together. Labor is degrading, so of course, they are idle; a slave or two becoming the \"hewers of wood, the drawers of water,\" the scapegoat of their master's idleness, and the occasional victims of their vindictive wrath. Men fresh from the busy scenes of the enterprising North had hard work to suppress a feeling of contempt for these, the worst\n\n63\n\nvictims of slavery, stigmatized by the haughty slaveholders and by plantation negroes as \"poor white trash.\" The beautiful South lies sterile and her people semi-barbarous at the feet of her evil genius, Slavery, but will grow young, powerful and strong, and occupy a proud position by the side of the sister States of the North only after this race of do nothings is gone, when free labor comes to touch with new magic the springs of intelligence, enterprise and industry.\n\nFinally, after surviving the perils of \"riding on a rail,\" and after being jolted and pounded in the closely packed box cars until every joint from toe to crown was as \"stiff as a poker,\" we reached Rolla shortly after noon of September 29th. We proceeded to the recently vacated camp of the 13th Ill., and pitching our tents, were at home again. It required but a short time to understand that the pic-nic days of Camp Hammond were over, that playing soldier was played out, and that now we were to come down to genuine hard work.\n\n64\n\nChapter V. — Rolla.\n\nPage Image\n\nRolla, the country seat of Phelps County, Missouri, at that time the terminus of the railroad, was an insignificant gathering of tumble down shanties, built of logs and boards, scattered here and there in the brush as though they happened there by chance, and might have been very appropriately classed with those institutions so common in the South-west, known as \"one horse towns.\" Every other shanty was a whisky shop, from whence proceeded every form of loathsome disease and death which prevailed to an alarming extent among some of the regiments stationed there. The Court House, a large, brick structure, was used as a hospital. Of its two hundred sick and suffering inmates, three-quarters were Missourians, who were not considered in their normal condition unless saturated with whisky. One might pick up any of those lank, three-story-and-an-attic specimens of the genus Missouri, wring him out, and whisky would ooze from every pore. It was apparent that to a greater or less extent their example was contagious among the northern regiments, and exerted a powerful influence in persuading many to patronize the hospitals and graveyard, as well as those dead falls\n\n65\n\nlabelled saloons. This was the main cause of so great a percentage of sickness and mortality among those who were supposed to be acclimated to the country, and to modes of life which on the distant frontier much resemble that of a soldier in camp.\n\nOn Col. Greusel devolved the command of the Post. The first measure inaugurated by him, and the first expedition in which the 36th participated, was a demonstration in force against the whisky dens. The Colonel commanded the expedition in person, and with a detachment from the 36th, headed the charge, seized and emptied all the liquors they could find. Very little of the extract of corn remained in Rolla at the close of that campaign.\n\nPrevious to the occupation of the town and the establishment of a military post at Rolla, trees and brushwood covered the slopes and cumbered the streets, or more properly, bridle paths. Situated in the midst of a scantily settled country — a silent, sleepy region, but little troubled with Yankee enterprise or modern agricultural improvements, and as a business center scarcely producing a ripple upon the dull monotony of the region — there were no inducements for building. But in time the groves were cut down, the land cleared and leveled for parade grounds, and the hills denuded of their foliage for purposes of fuel. War, with its wonder-working power, wrought a great change in the appearance of this sleepy town. White-walled, canvass villages sprang up and crowned the hill sides; sentries paced up and down its once quiet walks; and army wagons, soldiers, mounted officers, and orderlies hurrying from camp to camp over rough, forest ways, gave it an air of business, activity and bustle, quite in contrast with the primitive days of the town. The population was largely made up of apple women, mustang ponies, fugitives from the outskirts of civilization, mules, contraband negroes, with now and then a secessionist not smart "
