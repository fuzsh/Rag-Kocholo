ACC responsible for effecting the transfer of Allied-occupied Italian territory to Italian Government jurisdiction, and for ensuring the Italian Government's adherence to the armistice, signed September 3, 1943, with terms specified and agreed to, September 29, 1943. During period November 1943-January 1944, three AFHQ organizations exercised military government functions in Italy: ACC; Headquarters Allied Military Government (AMG), functioning in the stable occupied areas; and Headquarters AMG Allied Central Mediterranean Force (ACMF, formerly 15th Army Group), controlling, in the combat zone and the immediate rear area, AMG units serving with Fifth U.S. and Eighth British Armies. In a reorganization of military government activities effected by General Order 5, AFHQ, January 24, 1944, Headquarters AMG and Headquarters AMG ACMF were abolished, with functions assumed by ACC; ACC was removed from direct responsibility to AFHQ and assigned to ACMF; and Lt. Gen. Sir Noel Mason MacFarlane was designated both ACC Chief Commissioner (thus, chief executive officer) and ACMF Chief Civil Affairs Officer. By same general order, AMG units serving with Fifth U.S. and Eighth British Armies were assigned administratively to ACC, but remained under operational control of the respective army commanders. ACC supervised all regions of Italy except Venezia Giulia and Udine, which remained under AMG supervision (see 331.31). Pursuant to a joint declaration by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill (\"Hyde Park Declaration\"), September 26, 1944, that the word \"Control\" would be removed from the ACC name to mark the transition from Allied to Italian Government jurisdiction, ACC redesignated Allied Commission (AC) by a memorandum from G-5 Section, AFHQ, to Headquarters ACC, October 24, 1944. AC organizations gradually discontinued, 1944-46. AC abolished by Staff Memorandum 3, AFHQ, January 31, 1947, in accordance with Combined Chiefs of Staff signal message FAN 711, January 11, 1947, with residual functions divided, in AFHQ, between Office of the Chief Civil Affairs Officer (formerly Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-5) and the newly established Italian Military Affairs Section.\n\nTop of Page\n\n331.30.1 General records of headquarters\n\nTextual Records: Subject-numeric file, 1943-45, consisting of consolidated records of the Allied Military Government of the Occupied Territory (1943-44), the Allied Military Mission (1943), AMG 15th Army Group (1943-44), and Headquarters AC (1943-45).

FTT, consisting of the City and Port of Trieste and surrounding territory, was divided into Zone A (which included the City and Port), administered by AMG, BUSZ; and Zone B, administered by organizations of the Yugoslav Government. The provisional administration was continued, 1947-54, because of the UN Security Council's inability to agree upon the selection of a governor. By a Memorandum of Understanding between the Governments of Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia, signed October 5, 1954, and subsequently accepted by the UN Security Council, the signatories agreed to an end of FTT provisional government and to the transfer, with a slight border adjustment, of Zone A territory to Italy and Zone B territory to Yugoslavia. By same memorandum, Italy agreed to maintain Trieste as a free port in accordance with terms of the Treaty of Peace with Italy.
