        "text": "Before I discuss in detail the history of my ancestor Joseph Archer (1835?-1915), who was for about four years of his 80-year life an officer in the Confederate Army, I think it would be appropriate for me to make some notes about the social, economic and political culture of the area in which he grew up.\n\nThese notes grew organically, are principally for my own future use, and were not the product of a well-organized outline, so they are not necessarily the best organized.\n\nI am including references which I believe are useful, though I am not really following a standard citation format. If the source has a recommended citation format, I just copied and pasted it. If I wrote the citation myself, I more-or-less follow the format of the Blue Book used by lawyers and judges for citations, as this format was beaten into my head during law school. Source references are cumulative; if I use a source in one section, everything below it may also make reference to it, rather than me repeating it again in the source list for a section. I hope this is not too confusing to the reader.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nScope and Geography of this Discussion\n\nCensus Records 1850-1860 for Sullivan and Washington Counties\n\nA History of Slavery, Manumission and Abolition in East Tennessee\n\nSome Additional Runaway Slave Ads\n\nBiographical Sketches of Watauga Valley Slaveowners\n\nSecession in East Tennessee — Particularly Washington and Sullivan Counties\n\nWashington County and Sullivan County Units During the Civil War\n\nBrief Biographies of Some Watauga Valley-area Civil War Soldiers\n\nNewspaper Clippings re: the 29th Tennessee Regiment\n\nScope and Geography of this Discussion\n\nIn discussing the Watauga Valley, I am talking about an area in southern Sullivan County, Tennessee and northern Washington County, Tennessee; specifically, those areas formerly known as Civil Districts 9 (Brush Creek), 10 (Knob Creek), 11 (Boones Creek a/k/a Boons Creek) and 12 (Buffalo Ridge) of Washington County and Civil District 8 and 9 of Sullivan. Today, this area would include all of the areas upstream of TVA Boone Dam, including Gray, much of Johnson City, as well as the unincorporated area of Piney Flats and the Tri-Cities (TRI) Airport on the Sullivan County side of the Watauga.\n\nI did not include any part of Carter County in my analysis or some parts of Sullivan County downstream of Boone Dam (for example, Civil District 14, the area where Colonial Heights is now situated). Part of the reason I am excluding Carter County is because the 1860 Census of Carter County was not done by civil district but by dividing the county into three divisions, named “1st Division”, “2nd Division”, and “Elizabethton”. I am not sure aside from the one named “Elizabethton” how these records map to a particular geographical area. Also, none of my ancestors, insofar as I am aware, lived in Carter County, so I have no personal interest in documenting it.\n\nI recognize this may be something of a “private definition” as the Watauga River continues into Carter County and into North Carolina. I am not particularly concerned with the upper reaches of the Valley here. The main reason for defining the Watauga Valley in this way is that this is the part in which my ancestors resided, in the lower stretches just above the confluence with the Holston.\n\nThe Tennessee Virtual Archive has an early surveyor’s map of the civil districts of Washington County from 1836:\n\n(Note that this map has north pointing more-or-less to the left; up is east; right is south; west is down).\n\nHere is another map from the 27 May 1875 edition of the (Jonesborough) Herald and Tribune, which is referred to on the tngenweb.org website and found on newspapers.com:\n\nThe two maps, from roughly 40 years apart, are largely similar, although the 4th and 6th districts were reorganized (the 6th becoming an area south of the Nolichucky around Embreeville, today a few miles northwest of Erwin; the 4th becoming all of that area on the southeast side of Washington County that today is largely part of the Cherokee National Forest).\n\nThe Tennessee Virtual Archives also has a similar early map of Sullivan County from 1836 (north is to the top right, south to the bottom left):\n\nSullivan County in 1860 had very nearly the same boundary lines as it does today (though sometime between 1930 and 1960 it lost a wedge of land southeast of Pine Ridge around Fall Branch, that is now part of Washington County).\n\nWashington County, however, extended much further south than it does now, all the way to the North Carolina border. In 1875 the Tennessee Legislature created Unicoi County from the parts of Old Washington County and Carter County nearest the North Carolina state line. A piece of southwestern Washington was also transferred to Greene County a few years later.\n\n(There were also several (ultimately unsuccessful) efforts made from 1836 to 1857 to separate some of the western districts of Sullivan County and join them with nearby parts of Washington, Greene and Hawkins County to form Powell County (seated in Fall Branch); however this county was never fully-organized and ultimately was dissolved. I believe that parts of Washington’s 12th District would have been in Powell County had it formed, but that issue has been moot for over a century and a half).\n\nHere is a rough free-hand sketch of the study area overlain on an 1880 railroad map:\n\nSome Census Records and Statistics, 1850-1860\n\nCounty-Level Statistics\n\nU.S. Census Bureau publications from the 1800s generally included breakdowns at the county level but not lower subdivisions. Also, it seems wise to compare the Watauga Valley to the surrounding areas, so let’s look at the county-level statistics for Sullivan and Washington Counties first.\n\n1850 Census\n\nThe population of Washington County in 1850 was reported as 13,861, being 91.4 percent white, 1.8 percent (260 persons) free people of color, and 6.7 percent (930) enslaved people of color (does not add up to 100 percent due to rounding). The total population was up 18 percent over the 1840 Census. The population skewed young; about 10.2 percent of whites were under the age of 5, and about 40.7 percent of whites were between the age of 5 and 20, with about half of those attending school. A significant portion (about 28 percent) of the free white adult population could not read or write. Agriculture (particularly corn, wheat, oats/barley and dairying) was the dominant agricultural activity; only about 216 people were involved in manufacturing, and the value of farms and implements was about 14 times that of capital invested in manufacturing.\n\nSullivan County had a slightly smaller population in 1850 than Washington County — about 11,742 — and also a slower-growing population, up only 9 percent from 1840. Sullivan County’s population was 90.2 percent white, 1.1 percent (135) free people of color, and 8.6 percent (1004) enslaved people of color (this does not add up to 100 percent due to rounding). The population was even younger and more agrarian than that of Washington County, with about 57 percent of the white population in Sullivan being under the age of 20, and only about a third as much capital invested in manufacturing. The adult white population in Sullivan County does seem to have been somewhat more literate however, with only about 17 percent of free whites being wholly unable to read or write.\n\nSources:\n\nJ.D.B.

While there was an absolute increase in the number of enslaved people, the absolute and relative number of free people of color grew somewhat faster (there being 47 additional free and 22 additional slaves in this time). Of the enslaved population, 71 percent were classified as “black” and 29 percent as “mulatto” (or mixed-race).\n\n(Across the state of Tennessee as a whole, enslaved people of color made up 24.8 percent of the total population of 1,109,861; free people of color made up only 0.7 percent of the total statewide population.)\n\nThe population of Washington County continued to skew young; about 55.5 percent of the white population was under the age of 20, with a large demographic bulge in the 20-30 year old bracket (17 percent of the white population) and a notable drop off in older age brackets. In 1860 about 1,804 white men were between the ages of 20 and 40, with another 897 between the age of 15 and 20. There were 2,425 family units in Washington County in 1860.\n\nIn Sullivan County, the total population grew to 13,552 people (up 15.4 percent from 1850), The population was 90.8 percent white, 1.2 percent (169) free people of color, and 7.9 percent (1,074) enslaved people of color (being 81 percent “black” and 19 percent “mulatto”). Although both the number of free people of color and the number of enslaved people had grown, in Sullivan County the enslaved population was growing faster (about 34 additional free and about 70 additional enslaved people of color since the 1850 Census). There were 2,186 families in Sullivan County in 1860.\n\nThe improved farm acreage in Washington County grew significantly between 1850 and 1860, from 86,794 acres across 922 farms in 1850 to 113,752 acres in 1860 (number of farms unknown). The cash value of the farmland also nearly tripled, to over $4.5 million (not including $155,000 in farm implements). Farmland thus made up almost all of the value of real estate in Washington County (about $4.7 million) and the vast majority of total wealth ($7.8 million). The most value products continued to be corn, wheat, grains, butter and meat; although some wool was produced in Washington County, no cotton was produced.\n\nThe improved farm acreage shrank slightly (from 95,034 acres across 816 farms, to 94.168 acres) but the value of the farmland roughly doubled to $2.8 million (with total real estate valued at about $3.3 million and total wealth at about $5.9 million). Sullivan County actually produced a very small amount of ginned cotton by 1860, but as in Washington County the most significant agricultural products were corn, grains, meat and dairy. Both counties had approximately 4,000 horses recorded in the 1860 Census.\n\nManufacturing capital more than doubled between 1850 and 1860 in Washington County, though it remained secondary to agriculture in terms of economic value, with about $282,000 invested, 305 employees and $691,000 in annual production value. Significant industrial products included milled flour, metals (iron and tin), lumber and leather.\n\nIn Sullivan County, manufacturing capital remained steady (and far behind that in Washington County, which had nearly 7 times the invested capital). Only about 59 people worked in manufacturing in 1860, and the annual produced value was a mere $72,000. Sullivan County manufacturers produced milled flour and iron.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, nearly 1,200 miles of railroad was constructed in Tennessee, including over 130 miles of the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. The ET&V ran from Knoxville to Bristol through Jonesborough and Johnson’s Depot (now Johnson City, briefly known as Haynesville), but bypassed Kingsport and other settlements in western Sullivan County.\n\nIn 1860 there were 21 Methodist, 15 Baptist, 7 Presbyterian and 1 Lutheran churches in Washington County. There were 15 Methodist, 8 Presbyterian, 7 Baptist, 4 Lutheran and 3 Christian/Union churches in Sullivan County. For the most part, these tallies are not broken down by district, but either by accident or special procedure, it is noted that the Brush Creek District (9th Civil District) of Washington County had a Baptist congregation.\n\nWe do not know the exact membership counts for each denomination from the Census; however, based on a regression model of late-19th century church attendance by Finke and Stark, we can make an informed guess about church membership. The Census values for number and value of churches and number of seats allow us to estimate that there were probably about 1,473 practicing Baptists, 4,416 Methodists and 834 Presbyterians in Washington County. There were probably about 952 Baptists, 2,034 Methodists and 896 Presbyterians. Note that in both counties (even accounting for the fact that I did not include minor denominations), it seems plausible that a significant minority of people in this area were not “churched,” despite the fact that there were far more seats than people to fill them in local churches.\n\nBoth counties had a small number of paupers; 15 in Washington and 19 in Sullivan. There seems to have been relatively few criminal convictions; the social schedule for Washington county reports 2 criminal convictions in the past year, and the schedule for Sullivan shows only three people imprisoned.\n\nSources:\n\nJoseph C.

Available online through JSTOR.org.\n\nDistrict-Level Analysis for 1860\n\nThese statistics were compiled by reviewing the Census returns from 1860 for the five civil districts of interest transcribed on familysearch.org.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the Washington County records for 1850 seem to be marked as being from “4th Subdivision, Eastern District”, rather than separated by county civil districts. I do not believe Subdivision 4 is equivalent to Civil District 4, as the returns contain enough records to account for everyone who lived in Washington County, and many of those records are for people who are known to have not lived in Civil District 4, “Swinney’s District” east of Jonesborough. A similar district-level analysis, therefore, is impossible for the 1850 Census.\n\nSullivan C.D. 8\n\n— Boring Sullivan C.D. 9\n\n— Piney Flats Total Population 972 796* Free Households 162 148 White Persons 886 788 Free Persons of Color** 5\n\n(5 mulatto) 8\n\n(8 black) Enslaved Persons 81 0* Free Males 435 408 Free Female 456 388 Free Males 20 or Older 169 174 Free Males 15-40 142 156 Enslaved Males 45 n/a Enslaved Female 36 n/a Median Age of Free Persons 16 17 Median Age of Enslaved Persons 17 n/a Slaveholders 15 0* Notable Slaveholders Lawrence Snapp (12), Mary C.

Counting these “other” records toward “free people of color” leads to an implausibly high tally (they would tally up to 294, nearly the entire official tally for free people of color — 297 — for the whole county despite these districts comprising only a small portion of it). I suspect that many of those marked as “other” in the transcription were tallied as “white” in the official statistical reports. Those records marked “other” may represent people with Native American ancestry, a small amount of black ancestry, or perhaps most likely simply an error on the part of the Census taker or later transcriptionists; I would suggest most of the “other” records should be excluded.\n\nNote that the slave schedules only count enslaved persons present in the district; in a few cases, enslaved people owned by residents of other districts may appear, and vice-versa.\n\nAlso note that some of the enslaved people counted in the 1860 Census slave schedules appear on the “wrong” pages, and I have tried to account for that. It is possible that I am erring, but I am trying to use common sense to make this work.\n\nThe vast majority of the free persons of the area where native to the United States, with the vast majority of those being born in Tennessee:\n\nIn Sullivan’s 8th district, 87 percent of the free persons were born in Tennessee, 8 percent in Virginia, 3 percent in North Carolina, and most of the balance in Pennsylvania (about 0.5 percent), Maryland (about 1 percent) or other northern states. One person is recorded as being born in Ireland.\n\nIn Sullivan’s 9th district, 89 percent of the free persons were recorded as being born in Tennessee, 5 percent born in Virginia, 4 percent born in North Carolina, 0.5 percent born in Pennsylvania, and 0.4 percent (3 persons) born in Ireland.\n\nIn Washington’s 9th district, 77 percent were born in Tennessee, 8 percent in Virginia, and 8 percent in North Carolina, and less than one percent born in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Indiana, Kentucky, etc. Two people are recorded as being from Maine.\n\nIn Washington’s 10th district, 79 percent were born in Tennessee and 15 percent born in Virginia. Two Irish immigrants are recorded.\n\nIn Washington’s 11th district, 73 percent were born in Tennessee, about 15 percent in Virginia, and about 7 percent in North Carolina, with most of the balance being from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Indiana. One person was born in Germany.\n\nIn Washington’s 12th district, 89 percent were born in Tennessee, 4 percent in Virginia, and 2 percent in North Carolina. One immigrant from Italy is recorded.\n\nMost of those with recorded occupations were engaged in farming, domestic work, or day laboring, with a few exceptions. For example, in Sullivan’s 9th district, eight blacksmiths, four carpenters, two millers, a stone mason, a wagonmaker, a cooper, a cabinetmaker, a shoemaker, a merchant, a lawyer and a school teacher.\n\nSome notably wealthy individuals (relative to others nearby) include:\n\nIn Sullivan’s 8th District: Thomas C. Spurgeon ($14,000 in real estate, $8,000 in personal property), Jesse Cross ($8,000 in land, $7,000 in personal property), John Hawley ($10,000/$9,400), Thomas Crawford ($14,000/$1,250), John N. Rhea ($12,000/$4,000), and Robert P. Fickle ($2,500/$8,000).\n\nIn Sullivan’s 9th District: Andrew Shell ($5,000 in real estate, $7,340 in personal property), Jesse Allison ($7,500/$4,400), Isaac King ($10,000/$1,870), and Isaac Devault ($7,700, $8,320),\n\nIn Washington’s 9th District: Alfred Carr ($12,457/$1,070), Peter M. Reeves ($16,150/$5,400), Samuel Miller ($10,670/$3,437), Henry Bashor ($8,125/$3,075), Rev. James Miller ($11,626/$9,080), John H. Bowman ($7,075/$7,400), Henry Johnson ($10,000/$9,194), Dr. Thomas T. Young ($1,500/$11,270), John Lyle ($29,100/$20,570), Joseph L. Burts ($17,880/$18,445), John White ($19,405/$11,590), George King ($10,142/$3,774), Landon C. Hoss ($21,110/$5,110), Abraham Hoss ($8,575/$4,210), Tipton Jobe ($14,065/$9,350), and Landon C. Haynes ($9,600/$1,545).\n\nIn Washington’s 10th District: J. F. Deaderick ($18,300/$7,200), Matthew Aiken ($10,000/$6,797), Jacob Range ($10,000/$1,575), Jacob Devault ($9,870/$11,674), Valentine Devault ($13,480/$2,434), William R. Rhea ($11,725/$10,737), and R.D. Bear ($7,000/$3,050).\n\nIn Washington’s 11th District: Michael Bashore ($8,000/$2,297), Robert Allison ($9,635/$2,270), Fuller P. Hale ($5,400/$5,060), James Hodge ($9,175/$5,726), James Vaughn ($10,000/$3,870), James H. Deakins ($16,200/$6,051), Hugh A. Crawford ($18,305/$6,255), David Garst ($12,250/$1,205), J.M. Hoss ($9,500/$16,581), David Carr ($5,000/$14,920), Elbert S. Cox ($11,060/$6,779), Mark Pennybaker ($7,280/$3,825), Alford Martin ($11,655/$5,950), Lawrence Bowers ($9,000/$4,355), and George Faw ($7,320/$3,524),\n\nIn Washington’s 12th District: Jonathan B. Williard ($10,625 in real estate only), George Gray ($10,340/$1,306), John R. Spergin (Spurgeon?) ($16,500/$4,500), and David Kitzmiller ($9,340/$1,056).\n\nBy comparison, in the Boone’s Creek District, the total real property value was $302,133 and the total personal property was $131,427 (figured by adding the sums at the bottom of each sheet). This computes, on a per capita basis (excluding slaves), to $337 and $147 respectively; or about $2,289 in land and $996 in personal property per household. A similar analysis for Brush Creek District shows per capita (excluding slave) wealth of $461 and $242 in land and personal estate, respectively. The county-wide average (for Washington County) was $341 and $222 for land and personal estate, respectively. Assuming that these districts are representative of the area as a whole, then, it seems that they were neither remarkably wealthy nor remarkably poor; though it does seem that the value of land relative to other property tilted relatively more heavily toward land in this area than in Washington County as a whole.\n\nSullivan’s 8th Civil District, had a per capita (excluding slaves) wealth of $187 in land and $118 in personal property. The county per capita wealth was $262 in land and $210 in personal property.\n\nThe four Washington County districts analyzed here made up about 23 percent of the total number of enslaved people in Washington County, and about 23 percent of the total population. Likewise, in Civil District 8 of Sullivan County, the enslaved population made up about 7 percent of the county’s total enslaved population; the total population of the district made up about 8 percent of the county. With the possible exception of Sullivan County’s 9th Civil District (where a slave schedule does not exist), it seems therefore that the Watauga Valley region had a ratio of free to enslaved people in 1860 that was roughly equal to that of the surrounding Washington/Sullivan region.\n\nBy comparison, the town of Jonesborough seems to have had about 208 enslaved residents (164 on two pages marked “Jonesboro” and 44 more on another marked “Jonesborough”), representing 22 percent of the enslaved people in Washington County. Jonesborough also had about 1231 free citizens (including 64 free people of color), representing only about 9 percent of the free population of the county (or, the total population of Jonesborough was about 10 percent of Washington County’s total population).\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Jonesborough’s wealth was also exceptional; the per capita real estate value for Jonesborough’s free residents was $562 and the per capita value of other property was $567, for a total per capita wealth more than twice that of the average Washington County resident. Jonesborough residents held about 18 percent of the county’s total wealth, and 23 percent of the personal property wealth. Some individual estates in Jonesborough were simply staggering, relative to those of their country neighbors:\n\nA. E. Jackson held $89,400 of land and $28,300 in personal property (presumably inclusive of his 18 slaves, but also likely including substantial mercantile stores despite being listed as a farmer, according to W. Todd Groce).\n\nG.A. Clark, a retired businessman originally from Canada, had a personal estate of $42,012.\n\nEva Gillespie had $43,144 in land and $13,837 in personal property.\n\nWilliam K. Blair, a pension agent, and Dr. Samuel P. Cunningham had over $30,000 in total wealth.\n\nJohn Blair, whose occupation is listed as “keeping hotel”, held $31,266 in land and $10,940 in personal property.\n\nZ.L. Burson, listed as “merchant”, held $30,530 in land and $39,685 in personal property, and owned several slaves.\n\nWilliam Brewer, a merchant, held over $30,000 in total property.\n\nWilliam G. Gammon, “broker”, held $25,900 in land and $68,000 in personal property, and six slaves.\n\nCongressman Thomas A. R. Nelson, a lawyer by occupation, held $26,200 in land and $21,935 in personal property, and eight slaves.\n\nWith regard to farming in the area:\n\nFor the 160 farms counted in the Agricultural Schedule, Brush Creek District (District 9) had 10,791 improved acres and 14,709 unimproved acres with a total value of $466,132. There were 379 horses, 20 mules, 372 milk cows, 8 working oxen, 530 other cattle, 1,132 sheep and 2,295 hogs. There were 20,115 bushels of wheat, 37,057 bushels of corn and 840 pounds of tobacco.\n\nFor the 40 farms counted in the Agricultural Schedule, Knob Creek District (District 10) had 2,227 improved acres and 3,143 unimproved acres with a total value of $104,307. It had 126 horses, 4 mules, 113 milk cows, 10 working oxen, 121 “other cattle” (bulls, cows to be slaughtered, etc.), 318 sheep and 645 hogs. It produced 5,505 bushels of wheat, 11,630 bushels of corn and 550 pounds of tobacco.\n\nFor the 74 farms counted in the Agricultural Schedule, Boone’s Creek District (District 11) had 7,515 improved acres and 5,788 unimproved acres, valued at $298,114. There were 258 horses, 27 mules, 247 milk cow, 268 other cattle, 658 sheep and 1,740 hogs. Wheat yields were 17,620 bushels; corn 27,600 bushels; and 5600 pounds of tobacco (almost all of which was produced by Jacob Garst).\n\nFor the 80 farms counted the Agricultural Schedule, Buffalo Ridge District (District 12) had 4,847 improved acres and 3,606 unimproved acres worth $144,471. There were 205 horses, 5 mules, 182 milk cows, 186 other cows, 708 sheep, 1,433 hogs. Wheat yield was 10,597 bushels; corn was 22,043 bushels; and 15 pounds of tobacco were produced.\n\nA significant amount of oats was also produced in all four districts, presumably to feed horses and mules.\n\n(The pages for Sullivan County Districts 8 and 9 are difficult to read, so I did not do a similar analysis for them).\n\nSources:\n\n“United States Census, 1860,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GBSX-SSH?cc=1473181&wc=7QMS-84L%3A1589422383%2C1589422318%2C1589436310 : 24 March 2017), Tennessee > Washington > Brush Creek District > image 1 of 21;

Todd Groce, Mountain Rebels: East Tennessee Confederates and the Civil War, 1860-1870 (1999).\n\nA History of Slavery, Manumission, and Abolitionism in East Tennessee, particularly Washington County and Sullivan County\n\nI. Before Tennessee Statehood (1760-1796)\n\nThe history of slavery in East Tennessee coincides nearly with the first white settlements of the area, then part of the British colony of North Carolina. Ramsey recalls an 18-year old enslaved man part of the first Anglo-American longhunters to explore the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers, along with Col. James Smith and company, in 1766 (Ramey 69; see also Goodspeed’s Maury p. 117).\n\nAccording to Bill Carey (on pages 3-4 of his book), describing Donelson’s account of his expedition of 1779-80:\n\nSixteen years before Tennessee became a state, there were slaves on the Donelson Party flotilla, which left Fort Patrick Henry (present-day Kingsport) and floated downstream on the Holston and Tennessee Rivers, bound for present-day Nashville. The first person to die on that journey was a slave. “Camped on the north shore, where Captain Hutchings’ negro man died, being much frosted in his feet and legs, of which he died,” John Donelson wrote in his journal.\n\n(See also Ramsey at 198 et seq.).\n\nAccording to local historian Oliver Taylor in 1909:\n\nSlavery is coexistent with the first settlements of Sullivan County. The earliest records we have… mention the purchase and exchange of slaves and more often the presence or possession of them….\n\nThe Island road, named for Long Island, from Kingsport through Virginia, was one of the great thoroughfares of slave-trade, as was the Blountville road, to Jonesboro and back through Virginia. This explains why there were more slave-owners along those two roads than there were along the Reedy creek road, running between and parallel with them…\n\n(Taylor at 272).\n\nDespite slavery’s presence in the area from the earliest days, general histories seldom mention slavery in great detail. The absence is particularly notable outside of the context of white abolitionists and the Civil War. For example, despite being a hefty 1,289 pages, the Washington County Historical Association, Inc.’s epic History of Washington County, Tennessee does not contain an index entry for “slavery” and only mentions it in any meaningful way in the chapter related to the Civil War, beginning on page 171, and continuing thereon for a few pages.\n\nMoreover, it is not unusual for authors, particularly those writing in the 20th Century, to soften slavery by making vague claims along the lines of “slavery wasn’t as bad here as it was elsewhere.” While there may or may not be truth to these claims — it is objectively true, for example, that the enslaved fraction of the population was smaller in Tennessee, and much smaller in East Tennessee, than it was in the Deep South — specific examples of slaveholder leniency are rarely given, and damning in their weakness. Referring back to Oliver Taylor (who frames much of his discussion of slavery in terms of “civilizing” the African people):\n\nIndian slaves worked side by side with negro slaves and in this way the latter absorbed much of the humor and quaint folk-lore of the Indian, but the Indian being a conservator would have none of the negro.\n\n…\n\nThe reputed cruel treatment of slaves has been much magnified as far as [Sullivan County] is concerned, but of course we may have had a milder form of slavery than the corn and cotton countries. Some owners never even whipped their servants, while other did chastise the unruly ones when occasion demanded.\n\n(Taylor 277) (note that Taylor claims in a footnote that some Indians sold themselves into slavery to pay debts or as prisoners of war; to the extent that this was the case it seems to have been in the earlier years of Tennessee settlement, as all of the records for enslaved people that I have reviewed, starting in 1850, appear to be for people with either African or African/European mixed-race heritage).\n\nAs Oliver Perry Temple, a Knoxville lawyer and prominent Unionist during the Civil War, states in his book East Tennessee and the Civil War:\n\nOur forefathers, though generally in moderate circumstances, brought slaves with them to East Tennessee from North Carolina and Virginia. This region was poorly adapted to the culture of cotton, rice or indigo. Yet at that day, and for many years afterward, every farmer had his “cotton patch.” This was for the purpose of raising a supply for domestic use. While cotton could be raised even in the eastern and more elevated counties, the region could not be classed as a cotton country.\n\nThat, however, was not always, and perhaps not generally the question. Men who desired to possess slaves did not stop to inquire into the question of profit or loss.\n\nThere was always connected with the ownership of slaves a sense of pride and independence, a supposed badge of superiority, that attracted men. Few in that day could resist the temptation of having some one to do for them the hard work of life, to relieve them of all drudgery, to wait upon them obsequiously, and to be ever present to do their will….\n\nOur forefathers, in East Tennessee, at an early day, so far as we can ascertain by the lights before us, do not seem to have cared very much about the moral aspect of slavery, either one way or the other. Those who were able, and felt so inclined, purchased and held slaves. But much the larger number seemed not inclined to own them.\n\n(Temple at 84-85)\n\nWhite settlers, however, were not the only ones who brought enslaved people into Tennessee; some Native American tribes also participated in slavery from an early date (Cary pp. 4 & 10, noting Chickamauga and Cherokee raids).\n\nIn1791, when the first Census of the United States was completed, what would later become Tennessee had been separated from North Carolina and designated as the “Territory South of The River Ohio” (confusingly, Kentucky, which actually contains the south bank of the Ohio, was already its own separate territory and became a state in 1792). The Territory contained two major districts each subdivided into counties: the Washington District (comprised of the counties of Washington, Sullivan, Greene, Hawkins and the county South of the French Broad) and the Mero District (comprised of Davidson, Sumner, and Tennessee County). The Census returns are shown below:\n\nThe tables indicated that there were about 535 enslaved people in Washington County, , 297 in Sullivan County with a total of 2,256 in the Washington District and 3,417 throughout the Territory as a whole; this represented 9.1 percent of the population of Washington County, 6.7 percent of the population of Sullivan County, 7.8 percent through the District as a whole; and 9.6 percent throughout the Territory (indicating that, even at this early date, slavery was somewhat less common in what would become East Tennessee, than what would become West Tennessee). The 1790 Census also counted about 361 free people of color throughout the Territory, about 1 percent of the population.\n\n(Note that in 1790, Washington County included most of the land that today comprises Carter County and Johnson County. This land was separated from Washington when Carter County was formed in 1796. Washington County also included most of modern Unicoi County that was not separated until after the Civil War. Sullivan County in 1790 was slightly larger than it is today but the boundary changes have been far less significant, and not worth discussing in detail.)\n\nAs Bill Carey notes in his study of slave advertisements, the slave trade was already a significant matter of concern in the Washington District as early as 1791, when the first issue of the state’s first newspaper, the Knoxville Gazette, published a “help wanted” advertisement seeking a “Negro fellow.” In the following months the same paper began to publish notices for runaway slaves, including from slaveowners in Washington and Sullivan counties. (Carey pp. 4 – 5). Slaves were also given away as prizes in local lotteries as early as 1794 (Ibid. at 7). The Washington County sheriff was involved in enforcing fugitive slave laws as early as 1792 (Carey pp. 5 and 141), even before the passage of the first federal fugitive slave law in 1793.\n\nSources:\n\nJ.

Statehood through Second Constitution (1797-1834)\n\nAt the first constitutional convention held at Knoxville in the winter of 1796, “a determined effort was made to prohibit slavery in the new state that was about to be created,” with thousands of petitioners asking the convention delegates to include a provision gradually phasing out slavery (Patton at 68-69). It has also been claimed, although the truth of this is questionable, that the 1796 state constitutional convention very nearly made Tennessee a free state. (Temple at 84, footnote 1, noting a claim by Horace Maynard that the proposal was defeated by a single vote). It is difficult to ascertain with certainty what was discussed and to what extent as no journal was kept of the debates of the statehood convention (Ramsey at 652-53). Regardless of these efforts, Tennessee’s first constitution ultimately contained no provisions directly allowing or prohibiting slavery, effectively preserving the legality of slavery, although also effectively the right of free blacks to vote (Coan; Blue Book at 591; Carey at 31).\n\nBy 1796, when Tennessee was admitted to the Union, the enslaved population had grown to 10,613 (Temple p. 83); by 1801 the statewide total had grown to 13,584 (12.9 percent of the population), with 533 (8.3 percent of the total county population) of those being in Washington County and 491(4.8 percent) in Sullivan County; the vast majority of enslaved people of color by this point being in the Mero District (Middle Tennessee). There were about 25 free people of color in Washington County and 17 in Sullivan County at that time.\n\n(Unfortunately, the Census schedules for Tennessee from 1790, 1800 and 1810 have been destroyed or lost, and the Census records from 1820 are also missing for most of East Tennessee. So we do not have a list of the slaveholders for these years.)\n\nIn 1801, the Legislature passed a law making it easier for a slaveowner to manumit (i.e. to voluntarily free his slaves). Prior to that it time it required petitioning the state legislature, but the new law permitted the local courts to do so (Patton at 75).\n\nUp through the 1820s, manumission movements sprang up in Tennessee (mostly East Tennessee). In 1815, the Tennessee Manumission Society was formed, with branches in Washington and Sullivan Counties (Temple at 84-85). Other societies also formed; by 1827, perhaps 1,000 Tennesseans were involved in 25 societies (Patton at 89; Goodheart at 224).\n\nIn 1819, Elihu Embree, an ironworker in the southern part of Washington County, began printing The Manumission Intelligencer in Jonesborough, which would become the Emancipator in 1820, before stopping publication upon Embree’s death. It is often described as the first newspaper dedicated to ending slavery in the United States (Blue Book 591-92; Temple at 90-91). Benjamin Lundy’s Universal Genius of Emancipation was also published for about two years in Greenville (Temple at 92-93; Patton at 93-94).\n\nWhile Embree and Lundy’s work is often mentioned today, in their own time they seem to have been little remarked upon; Embree’s name does not appear to have been mentioned in print (other than in his own literature) in Tennessee until after the Civil War (a point also made by Carey at 182). Generally speaking, manumission and abolitionist societies in Tennessee were not well-funded and largely ineffective outside of East Tennessee (Goodheart at 224-25). Moreover, those who supported manumission did not necessarily embrace immediate emancipation or abolition; Elihu Embree’s appears to have kept his slave Nancy, as well as her sons Frances and John and daughters Abigail, Sophia and Mariah, until his death (as his Will specifies their freedom).\n\nEmbree’s own zeal seems to have sprung from his conversion to Quakerism (although his father Thomas, who was for a time owner of the Pactolus Iron Works, also held anti-slavery views) (Brooks; Goodheart at 226). The Quakers (Society of Friends) were the most consistent opponents of slavery in antebellum Tennessee, though other denominations, particularly the Brethren (Cox and Cox at 172) Methodists (Temple at 103) and to a lesser extent, Presbyterians (Temple at 106, Cox and Cox at 172), adhered to anti-slavery views to some degree, particularly in the 1810s and 1820s.\n\nAs the decades passed, however, zeal among Methodists and most other protestants became hesitation, acceptance and even outright promotion of slavery, at least among its Southern congregants (Patton at 82-83; Martin at 108-109). The Methodist Church ended up splitting into Northern and Southern branches over clerical regulations relating to participation in the slave system (Patton at 87; Temple at 103; Martin at 109).\n\nDr. Frederick A. Ross, a Presbyterian pastor and theologian near Kingsport manumitted his slaves around 1830, but sometime after (allegedly due to being unable to find workers in East Tennessee), ended up buying more slaves to replace those he had freed; by 1853, he was so convinced of his error that he gave a passionate defense of slavery at the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, declaring slavery “ordained by God.” (Temple at 257; Chattanooga News; Ross at 11). “My own emancipated slaves would today be worth greatly more than $20,000,” Ross lamented. Challenging the good faith and charitable intentions of Northern abolitionists, he then asked, “Will you give me back $10,000? Good. I need it now.” (Ross at 18-19). The Presbyterian synod in Tennessee withdrew from the national Presbyterian Church over slavery in 1857 (Goodspeed-East Tennessee at 939).\n\nThe first few decades of the Nineteenth Century saw several shifts in Tennessee politics and culture that set the stage for a massive expansion and entrenchment of slavery in Tennessee:\n\nAdoption of the cotton gin and commercialization of farming (Blue Book at 591).\n\nThe end of organized Native American resistance to white settlement. Military expeditions in the 1810s led by Andrew Jackson directly or indirectly to treaties that led to the extinguishing of Indian land claims (formerly over two-thirds of the present-day state) leaving only the Cherokees in the southeast part of the state by 1820. (Id. at 594-95). As president two decades later, Jackson finished the removal of Indians from Tennessee by deporting the Cherokee to Oklahoma on the “Trail of Tears.” (Id. at 598-599).\n\nThe opening of West Tennessee to white settlement and the rapid development in West Tennessee of a cotton-based economy, as well as the continued rise in power of Middle of Tennessee, and the concurrent shifting of political and economic power away from East Tennessee. (Blue Book at 595).\n\nIn 1810, the enslaved population of Tennessee was 44,535 (17.0 percent of the statewide population) (this comes from 1850 Statistical View of the United States).\n\nIn 1820, the enslaved population in Tennessee was 80,107 (18.9 percent of the total statewide population); 39,565 of them under the age of 14 years. There were 2,727 free people of color. In Sullivan County, there were 836 enslaved people (11.9 percent of the population) and in Washington County, there were 979 (10.2 percent of the population). Across East Tennessee as a whole (which held about 31 percent of the state’s total population), there were 12,413 enslaved people (15.5 percent of the total slaves in the state) and 1,165 free people of color (42.7 percent of the total free people of color in the state).\n\nIn 1830, the total number of enslaved persons in Tennessee was 141,603 (20.8 percent of the state’s total population), with 4,555 free people of color (holding steady at about 0.7 percent of the state’s population). About 38 percent of the enslaved people across the state were under the age of 10 years. In Sullivan County, there were 1,187 enslaved people (11.8 percent of the population). In Washington, there were 1,040 enslaved people (9.5 percent of the total). Across East Tennessee as a whole, there were 17,887 enslaved people (12.6 percent of the total slave population across Tennessee).\n\nDespite the growth of slavery, the anti-slavery movement was able to score legislative wins as late as 1829, when the Tennessee state legislature passed an act permitting enslaved people to sue the executors of estates where manumission clauses in slaveowners’ wills were being ignored (Patton at 76).\n\nBy the end of 1831, however, the mood had changed significantly, with the shift usually attributed to the Nat Turner slave rebellion in Virginia that summer, and perhaps to a lesser extent the increasingly radical mood of Northern abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison (see, e.g. Temple at 252; Carey at 31; Patton at 76; Blue Book at 601; England at 41-42). By the end of December, the Tennessee legislature had passed new “defensive legislation” limiting the application of the 1829 manumission law; prohibiting the entry of free people of color into the state and requiring freed slaves to leave the state (e.g. to be removed to the colony of Liberia); as well as a law declaring “unusual” gatherings of slaves to be unlawful assemblies, and stepping up slave patrols (Acts of Tennessee 1831 at pp. 120-24; Patton at 76). The severity of the law relating to freed slaves led to it being subsequently revised in 1833 to exclude those emancipated before 1831; and from 1842-49 the legislature permitted local courts to grant amnesty to free people of color based on good behavior (Id. at 77). It has been said that the 1831 law was only enforced sporadically (with particular harshness during times of perceived emergency) as the number of free people of color only continued to grow after its passage (England at 49); and it has been written that only a few hundred people were ever effectively deported from Tennessee to Liberia (Patton at 102).\n\nThis law was tested in the case of Ford v. Ford, where the slaves of Loyd Ford, Sr. (a farmer in the Buffalo Ridge district of Washington County) brought forth a probate claim for freedom against his disapproving children. The will specified that the slaves were to live on his land, which contradicted the terms of the 1831 law (although later amendments softened it, at least until the 1850s). The case went all the way to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which upheld Ford’s will in 1846 and freed his slaves. (Tennessee Encyclopedia article; Howington article).\n\nThe entrenchment of slavery in Tennessee law and culture continued during the 1834 constitutional convention, which met during the summer months in Nashville. There, an effort was made (including petitions from Washington County, and championed by Washington County delegate Matthew Stephenson) to include provisions that would have mandated the gradual abolition of slavery; but these proposals were handily rejected (Temple at 111, 254; Cox and Cox at 173).\n\nThe convention, perhaps responsive to popular indignation, released a report claiming, in effect, that it was better for both free and enslaved Tennesseans that the institution of slavery continue than to thrust enslaved people into the “gloomy” plight of being free people of color (Temple at 113).\n\nUltimately, the 1834 constitution, which seems to have been dominated by delegates from Middle and West Tennessee, stripped away the right to vote from free people of color (limiting the franchise to free white men) and deprived the General Assembly of the power to pass any laws relating to the emancipation of enslaved people without the consent of their owners (Temple at 118; Patton at 69-74).\n\nThese efforts were opposed by some delegates from East Tennessee, particularly Stephenson of Washington County, who also proposed, unsuccessfully, to add a provision protecting the suffrage of those who already had the right to vote (Temple at 118; Cox and Cox at 173). The elimination of black suffrage in particular seems to have been motivated by resentment stemming from the perceived power of free people of color in close elections, which allegedly provided the margin of victory in at least one congressional race (Patton at 73-74).\n\nFurther entrenching slavery in the state constitution, the Convention, by a margin of 31-27 agreed to add Article II, Section 31, which stated: “The General Assembly shall have no power to pass laws for the emancipation of slaves, without the consent of their owner or owners.”\n\nWith regard to this provision, Oliver Perry Temple wrote:\n\nThus the delusive hope and promise held out by the committee, speaking for the majority of the convention, that slavery would not be “perpetual,” was falsified, and the door to emancipation closed and barred apparently forever. Slavery was already protected by the Constitution of the United States, and now it was securely enthroned in that of Tennessee, from which it could only be dislodged by the slaveholders themselves.\n\n(Temple at 119).\n\nSources:\n\nTre Hargett (Secretary of State), Tennessee Blue Book 2019-2020 (2019).

Laws Relating To Slavery\n\nThe years between the second constitution if 1834 and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 mark a sort of golden age of the institution of slavery in Tennessee. The trajectory of the state’s laws during this time was toward greater suppression of abolitionism and stricter and crueler treatment of free people of color and the enslaved.\n\nAccording to Oliver Perry Temple:\n\nSoon after the events I have been relating, the antislavery current, which had been running so strongly for the past twenty years in favor of emancipation, in parts of the South, turned back in its course, and was lost in the maelstrom of slavery propagandism. Men who had once clamored for emancipation were either hushed into silence, or eagerly followed the swelling current of Southern thought. Many men who had denounced slavery, away back in emancipation days, now hastened to set themselves right with their neighbors by purchasing slaves. Every voice, every whisper of opposition to slavery, was silenced. Universal acquiescence, if not universal approval and advocacy, succeeded. If a few doubted, if a few still had conscientious scruples as to the system, they were hushed into silence in the dread of an overpowering public opinion. No man in the South was bold enough to open his lips in opposition to slavery. No man dared to suggest any longer either its amelioration, much less its extinction. To be suspected of abolition sentiments, was to bring on one’s self the curse of social outlawry; to become as a loathsome leper shunned by every one. The boldest men who had had scruples on the moral side of the question stood petrified and confounded in the presence of this omnipotent despotism of public opinion. By it, all resistance was crushed out.\n\n(Temple at 120; same passage cited approvingly by Cox and Cox on page 173).\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of the “omnipotent despotism” that Temple describes, is the history of the enactment of the 1836 act “to prevent the publication or circulation in this Sate of seditious pamphlets and papers.”\n\nThe 1834 Tennessee state constitution stated in its Declaration of Rights (Art I. sec. 19) that “The free communication of thoughts and opinions, is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty. ” In context, the term “abuse of that liberty” clearly relates to defamation, as the next several sentences go on to specify that truth would be an affirmative defense in libel cases.\n\nBut even while the ink was still drying on the new Declaration of Rights, the General Assembly went about the business of ignoring it. A great furor arose in the Southern states during 1835 about the unsolicited mailing by Northern abolitionists of abolitionist literature to Southerners (Savage; Barrett). In his December 1835 report to Congress, President Andrew Jackson called for Congress to pass a law “as will prohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation in the Southern States, through the mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.” (Jackson).\n\nThe United States Congress debated the subject of regulating mailed abolitionist pamphlets considerably, with the majority concluding that censorship of the mail would violate the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of the press and freedom of speech (Barrett at 103); and quite contrary to Jackson’s request, and in keeping with the spirit of the First Amendment, Congress did end up passing legislation specifically directing local postmasters to deliver the mail even if they found it objectionable (Savage at 183-84).\n\nThe Tennessee General Assembly took a different approach, enacting February 1836 a law that declared it a felony to “write, print, paint, draw or engrave” or to “aid or abet in writing, printing, painting, drawing or engraving… “any paper, essay, verses, pamphlet, book, painting, drawing or engraving, calculated to excite discontent, insurrection or rebellion amongst the slaves or free persons of color….” Other provisions of this bill specifically were aimed at prohibiting anti-slavery sermons by ministers of the Gospel “in the presence or hearing of any slave or free person of color.”\n\nAs Carey notes the sedition law was clearly written to avoid any loopholes, which he contrasts with the state’s ban on the importation into Tennessee of enslaved people for the purpose of sale or trade (which was in effect from 1827 to 1855) (Carey at 35-39).\n\nOther statewide laws restricting the liberty if its free white citizens with regard to slavery include: a prohibition on visiting a slave at night (even if the slave was a relative); a prohibition on harboring runaway slaves; a prohibition on carrying slaves on a ship or carriage without a written pass; a prohibition on allowing slaves to manage their own time or to own livestock of their own; a prohibition on giving weapons to slaves; a prohibition on trading with slaves, including selling them liquor or allowing them to practice medicine; and of course, a prohibition on whites marrying a person of color (and this law applied both to the married couple and to ministers and county clerks) (Carey at 34-36) (Revised Code at 500 et. seq.).\n\nThe corporation laws of Jonesborough also provided local restrictions on both enslaved people and on whites. In addition to the usual prohibition on whites visiting slaves after dark, free whites were also prohibited by local ordinance from permitting “frequent slave assemblies” or from selling liquor to slaves. Citizen slave patrols were organized to enforce these laws (Cox and Cox at 173-74).\n\nSlaves caught without passes by slave patrols (“paddyrollers”) were subject to imprisonment and beatings (Carey at 40).\n\nIn Washington County (where it is somewhat-plausibly claimed that slave treatment was less severe than in other parts of Tennessee), the county’s largest slaveholder, Dillard Love, was prosecuted by the local court for “allowing a slave to trade for himself” and “permitting a slave to act as free,” thus showing that restrictions on the behavior of enslaved people frequently transformed into restrictions on the owners themselves. (Cox and Cox at 172).\n\nThe restrictions on enslaved persons themselves were, of course, severe. As Carey notes:\n\nTennessee did not codify its laws until 1858. This makes it difficult to find out what the laws related to slavery were at any single point prior to that time. However, Tennessee’s laws related to slavery in 1858 were clear, and from the point of view of the slave, harsh.\n\nSlaves were not citizens and has practically no rights. Slaves did not have the right to file lawsuits or to bring charges against slaveholders. Slaves did not have the right to claim they were being abused, underfed or overworked. Furthermore, a free person who believed a slave owner was abusing, underfeeding or overworking his or her slave had no right to press charges or file a lawsuit against that person.\n\nThere were, practically, no laws that restricted a what a slaveholder could do to his or her slaves. Slave owners could work slaves as much as they wanted and force them to do whatever type of work they wanted. Slaveholders could, legally, rape their slaves. They could beat their slaves. They could not, however, “wantonly and without sufficient cause beat or abuse the slave of another person.” [emphasis in Carey]\n\nIn other words, it was legal for a slaveholder to beat his or her own slave “wantonly and without sufficient cause.” It was also legal to beat someone else’s slave, so long as it was not “wantonly and without sufficient cause.” It just wasn’t legal to randomly and without cause beat a slave that belonged to someone else.\n\nIt was, at least, illegal for a person to kill a slave. But there were two corollaries built into that law. For instance, it wasn’t considered murder if a slaveholder killed a slave who was “in the act of resistance to his master.” It also wasn’t considered murder if a slave died “under moderate correction” – a clause that was amplified in the law.\n\n(Carey at 32, referring to the enactment of The Code of Tennessee a/k/a The Revised Code of 1858; note that the reason why Tennessee laws were hard to determine with precision prior to that date is because Tennessee inherited the common law of North Carolina in 1796, which consisted of a mish-mash of colonial legislation and court decisions, and legislation passed by the Tennessee general assembly up to that point were simply modifications of that common law; see Patton and Patterson on this point).\n\nNote that the entirety of Title V (about 27 pages) of the Revised Code of 1858 relates to slavery and treatment of free people of color. but only one half of a page relates to “offenses against slaves”, primarily to prohibiting the murder of slaves “wilfully, with malice aforethought,” which in theory was punishable “in the same manner as a similar offence committed on the body of any white person” (as well as the payment of the slave’s value to his master, if the slave murdered was not the property of the murderer himself) (Revised Code secs. 2649-2652, pp. 512-513).\n\nBlacks, free or enslaved, could not testify against a white person in Tennessee state courts (Revised Code sec. 3808, p. 687). Consequently, it would have been practically impossible to prosecute abuse of slaves, notwithstanding the legality of such conduct (Carey at 38).\n\nThe importation of slaves from other states for sale in Tennessee was, in theory, illegal between 1827 and 1855. It was however not illegal for a Tennessean to purchase slaves in other states and import them for his own use (and then later sell them), or to hire others to do so on their behalf. It was also not illegal to transport slaves through Tennessee from one foreign state (e.g. Virginia) to another (e.g. Mississippi). Quoting Chase C. Mooney’s 1957 book on slavery, Carey states: “‘Interstate trading again became legal [in Tennessee] in 1855, and those who had been carrying on the trade under cover now came out into the open where they could reap much more substantial rewards.'” (Carey at 38-39).\n\nBy the 1850s, the policy of the State of Tennessee regarding free people of color was also quite draconian. All free persons of color were required to register with the clerk of the county court. Free people of color, even if they were never enslaved, were also subject to being deported to the “Western coast of Africa” (i.e. Liberia) if they failed to provide bonds for “good behavior,” and subject to imprisonment if found to be idle outside of their county of residence. The state of Tennessee also had a law permitting free people of color to sell themselves into slavery (presumably, as a way of exploiting those who incurred debts) (Revised code secs. 2710-2745, pp. 522-528).\n\nAs Patton (at 78) states: “It will be observed from the foregoing that the general tendency of all the legislation from 1831 to 1860 was toward the restriction of the slaves more and more and at the same time toward the elimination of the element known as the free Negro.”\n\nB. Remarks on Census Records for 1840, 1850 and 1860\n\nThe 1840 Census counted 183,059 enslaved people in the state of Tennessee out of a total population of 829,210 (22.1 percent of the total), with 3,670 free people of color (0.4 percent of the population).\n\nIn Washington County, there were 915 enslaved people, out of a total population of 11,751 (7.8 percent) with 236 free people of color (2.0 percent). In Sullivan county, there were 1,037 enslaved people out of a total population of 10,736 (9.7 percent of the population), with 195 free people of color (1.7 percent of the population).\n\nAcross the Grand Divisions of Tennessee in 1840: there were 56,610 enslaved people in West Tennessee (29 percent of the total population of West Tennessee and 31 percent of the slaves in the state), 107,735 in Middle Tennessee (26 percent of the total population of Middle Tennessee and 59 percent of the total number of slaves in the state), and 18,714 enslaved people in East Tennessee (8 percent of the population of East Tennessee and 10 percent of the slaves in the state).\n\nIn addition to the remarks on the 1850 and 1860 censuses made above, the enslaved population in 1850 across Tennessee was 239,459, out of a total population of 1,002,717 (23.9 percent). There were also 6,422 free people of color (0.6 percent). Relative to other states, Tennessee had the 8th largest slave population, and in terms of the proportion of enslaved people, Tennessee was slightly higher than Arkansas (22 percent enslaved) and Kentucky (21 percent) and somewhat lower than that of Texas (27 percent), Virginia and North Carolina (both 33 percent). It was about half of that in Alabama (44 percent) and Mississippi (51 percent of the population enslaved). If East Tennessee were counted as a separate state, its slave population would have ranked second lowest among slave states, higher only than Delaware (2.5 percent) and the District of Columbia (7.1 percent) and a bit lower than that of Missouri (at about 13 percent) and Maryland (15 percent).\n\nThe number of enslaved people statewide grew to 275,719 by 1860, out of a total population of 1,109,801 (24.8 percent), with 7,300 free people of color.\n\nAs can be seen, the absolute number of slaves in Sullivan and Washington Counties was relatively stable after 1830, while the enslaved share of the population slowly dropped; contrast with the state as a whole, where the enslaved population was continuing to grow both in absolute terms and as a share of the population through 1860.\n\nDuring this time, the share of free people of color also expanded significantly in absolute terms (although was fairly stable at about 1/2 of one percent of the state’s population, in percentage terms).\n\nAccording to the Census Slave Schedules for 1850, there were about 245 slaveowners in Washington County, Tennessee (based on my manual count of the census schedules). Seventy-seven of them owned one slave, 110 owned between two and five, and 58 owned more than five.\n\nCox and Cox, in their History of Washington County, Tennessee, conduct a similar analysis. They note that in 1860, enslaved people made up 33 percent of the population of West Tennessee and 29 percent of the population of Middle Tennessee, but only about 10 percent of East Tennessee (Cox and Cox at 171), Furthermore, they note that only 3 percent of slaveowners in East Tennessee owned 20 or more slaves (with only one of Washington County’s 238 slaveowners – Dillard Love – owning 20 slaves). In Washington County, only thirteen slaveowners held ten or more slaves, and “a third” owned only one. Cox and Cox estimate that slaves made up between 10 and 20 percent of the estimated wealth of the citizens of Washington County in 1860 (Id. at 172).\n\nHere are some of the largest slaveholders (those who owned more than 5 slaves) in Washington County in the 1850 Census Schedules: Seth J. W. Lucky (7), Landon C. Hoss (6), Elizabeth C. Johnson (9), Catherine Emberson (10), Alfred E. Jackson (11), Samuel B. Cunningham (6), Montgomery Davis (6), Michael Clem(?) (9), Daniel Barkly (7), Mark Hale (10), John M. Crawford (9), John Blair (8), John A. Wild (6), Thomas A. R. Nelson (12), John Hammer (6), Archibald Hale (8), Peter Miller (8), John Lyle (7), Joseph L. Burts (15), Joseph Crouch (7), Abraham Jobe (9), Samuel Hunt (6), Moses Carson (8), Brookins Campbell (8), Hugh A. Crawford (6), William B. Glaze (8), Soam Waddell (12), Ebenezer Barkly (18), Thomas T. Young (6), James McAlister(?) (6), A. H. Broyles (11), Adam Broyles (7), Ebenezer L. Mathes (8), Samuel Bayless (9), Mary Hunter (9), Abraham Snapp (6), Robert McKee (13), Christopher Sliger (9), Isaac Murray (11), Ruth Hill (15), Bird Brown (10), John F. Broyles (9), William K. Blair (17), Joseph Longman (6), Simon H. Jones (6), Samuel Templing (7), Henderson Clark (13), James Miller (10), Nicholas Keefauver (11), Henry Hall (10), Samuel Fitzgerald (9), James A. Walls (7), Samuel Keebler (9), William(?) Nelson (8), Jacob Miller (12), Joshua Royston (8), William R. Rhea (8), and Joseph S. Rhea (7).\n\nFrom this it appears that there were about 18 slaveowners who held 10 or more slaves in 1850 (and 58 who held five or more), but none with 20 or more. It seems that there may have been some narrowing of the slave-owning “elite” in Washington County, with some modest amount of “squeezing” of their middle ranks during the 1850s. In some cases, slaveholders died and slaves may have been distributed to their heirs, thus leaving more owners with fewer slaves. Other slave-owners who were significantly invested in the slave economy may have moved to “greener pastures” out west. Some slaveowners not listed here seem to have grown their holdings significantly during this decade (for example, Dillard Love held only 2 enslaved people in Washington County in 1850; William P. Reeves also seems to have added slaves during this time).\n\nIn Sullivan County in 1860 there were about 254 slaveowners, based upon a count of the owners listed on the Slave Schedules. I counted about 243 (it is imprecise because it is a manual count and did not carefully look for duplicates) in Sullivan County in the Census Schedules for 1850.\n\nAccording to the Census Slave Schedules for 1860 here are the slaveholders who owned the greatest number of slaves in each civil district of Sullivan County and Washington County:\n\nWashington County -------------------------------------------------------- Washington 1 William Glaze (15) Washington 2 Montgomery Hunter, John H.

Chambers (31)\n\n* The Slave Schedule marked “Jonesborough District” is confusing; Jackson may have been in Swinney’s District, in which case District 15 would be a tie between John Blair and Samuel Cunningham with 11 slaves each.\n\nNote that some slaveowners owned slaves in different districts, and in some cases extended families might own far more than just those listed under one owner’s name; for example, some frequently-appearing surnames in the Washington County slave schedules include Gillespie, Devault, Broyles, Bayles, Young and Hale. In Sullivan County, the slave schedules are populated with Kings, Rheas, Dulaneys and Bachmans.\n\nSome large slaveholders in Carter County included: “William Ervin’s two heirs” (30, Carter County); Robert Love (23, Carter County); “A.W. Taylor’s seven heirs” (22, Carter County); and various other members of the Stover, Carter and Taylor families (who combined owned several dozen slaves).\n\nFor a subset of the slaveowners in Sullivan County Civil District 8 and Washington County Civil Districts 9, 10, 11 and 12 for which I could handily guess their ages based on Census Records (total of 67 individuals), I found that the median age of a slaveowner was 49 years, and the average age of 49.3 years. I found only one man under the age of 30 whom I believe to be a slaveowner (the 23-year old younger Martin Kitzmiller), and I may have confused him with a relative (the 88 year-old elder Martin Kitzmiller, father of Elizabeth DeVault). Given the possibility for error and small sample size; I would say the median age for a slaveholder in this section was probably between about 45 and 55 years, and that most slaveowners probably acquired their first slaves in their 30s. Most of the owners tended to be men, though widows and (possibly) adult daughters who acquired slaves through inheritance.\n\nCox and Cox also note that there were more free blacks in Washington County alone than in the entire state of Arkansas (although this only seems to be true because there was a significant drop in free blacks between 1850 and 1860). The number of free blacks in Washington and Sullivan Counties combined also exceeded the number of free blacks counted in the entirety of Texas in 1860 (Cox and Cox at 172; see 1850 and 1860 census statistics).\n\nC. Notes on Slave Prices and Valuations\n\nMost sources seem to confirm that a slave usually cost about $1,000, with prices varying depending on several factors. (Cox and Cox at 171). Casey, for example, mentions bills of sale from 1836 for slaves exhibited at the East Tennessee State University’s Archives of Appalachia, mentioning one for a 17-year old girl for $900 and another for an 11-year old boy for $1,100 (Casey).\n\nSlaves were between the ages of 12 and 50 were considered taxable property (Revised Code secs. 541 and 542, pp. 171-72). Slaves also likely were exempt if they were, for example, government property or owned by Revolutionary War veterans and their widows (who were exempted from tax up to a value of $2,000) (Id.). It appears that unlike some other states, which applied a flat tax to slaves (for example, Mississippi applied a tax of 40 cents per slave and Virginia, $1.20 per slave), Tennessee held fast to the ad valorem principle of taxing slaves at the same rate as any other property. (Dunlap-’59 at xi). The tax rates, as shown in the chart on page 1 of Dunlap-’61, varied from year to year, but were generally around 10-15 cents per $100 assessed value, or about 50 cents to $1 per enslaved person. This would have been roughly comparable to, if not slightly higher than, the poll tax on free white men (which was 40 cents in 1854-1856, 50 cents per head in 1858-1859 and 35 cents per head in 1860-61).\n\nIn addition to being taxed as property, a $5 sales tax was also levied on professional slave-traders for each sold slave (Revised Code sec. 553, p. 175). However, the state receipts were quite minimal — a review of the 1860 “privilege taxes” table shows that a mere $83.57 was collected in all of Tennessee that year from “Negro Traders.” (Dunlap-’61 at 39). Whether the tax was artfully avoided or simply ignored is hard to say, but unfortunately these do not appear to be valuable records of slave transactions.\n\nSome of the Comptroller reports from this time period give specific breakdowns on source of revenue (and others are missing) —\n\nComptroller’s reports in 1845 and 1849 showed 448 assessed taxable slaves in 1844 and 428 in 1848 for Washington County, valued at $170,075 and $154,850 respectively ($379.63 and $361.80 average assessed value per enslaved person). For Sullivan County, those numbers are 557 assessed slaves in 1844, 512 assessed slaves in 1848, at average assessed values of $388.28 in 1844 and $366.24 in 1848. (Zollicoffer at 27, Shepperd at 26).\n\nThe 1859 Comptroller’s report showed for the year 1858 — 477 taxable slaves in Washington County, with a taxable value of $335,050 (or $744.34 assessed value per enslaved person). In Sullivan County there were 529 taxable slaves at an average assessed value of $626.47. This is a bit lower than the statewide average of $792.23 per taxable slave (Dunlap-’59 at 17, 18-19).\n\nThe same report showed for the year 1859 — 478 taxable slaves in Washington County, at an average assessed value of $573.03, and 528 taxable slaves in Sullivan County at an average assessed value of $683.72 per enslaved person (both lower than the statewide average of $854.65) (Dunlap-’59 at 17, 26-27, 65).\n\nIn the report for 1861, for the year 1860 — 462 taxable slaves in Washington County at an average assessed value of $747.32 per enslaved person, and 558 in Sullivan County at $677.18 in average assessed value per enslaved person. This is well below the statewide average assessed value of $886.40 per enslaved person (probably the highest average assessed value ever recorded in Tennessee slavery). (Dunlap-’61 at 1, 2-3).\n\nAnd for the year 1861 — 460 taxable slaves in Washington County, at $697.21 per enslaved person. In Sullivan County, 535 taxable slaves at $642.62 per enslaved person assessed. The statewide average assessment was $769.36 (Dunlap’61 at 1, 32-33).\n\n(Note that the rate of inflation during the mid-19th century was fairly insignificant).\n\nBy 1861, the total assessed value of slaves in Tennessee (which seems to have been a fraction of the market value, given that only about half of slaves — 131,567 — seem to have been assessed and the assessed values seem to have been below market value) was $101,222,581, or about 27.4 percent of taxable property in the state. In East Tennessee, the 13,110 assessed slaves were valued at $10,028,378, or 15.4 percent of the total taxable property. In Middle Tennessee, slaves were 26.5 percent of taxable property by value, and in West Tennessee, that figure was 33.4 percent.\n\nGenerally speaking, the assessed taxable value of slaves (which is not the same thing as the market value) seems to have been tied to the value of land and agricultural prospects (Cf. Patterson at 59 et seq.).\n\nD. Miscellaneous Notes Relating to Slavery ca. 1835-1860\n\nThe East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad (ET&V) connecting Bristol to Knoxville was built in part by hired-out slaves in the 1850s (Carey at 166). Ironically, the same railroad was likely later used to transport slaves from Virginia into Tennessee (Carey at 111,112, 229). Cox and Cox note that, in Washington County, “economic and political ties with the rest of the slave states were enhanced with the completion of the East Tennessee and Virginia Rail Road in 1858.” They continue: “Pro-slavery sentiment was evident in railroad towns such as Jonesborough. Ross Smith (who was born in 1846) remembered that on the issue of slavery: ‘Our town was pretty equally divided.'” (Cox and Cox at 173).\n\nEven before the opening of the ET&V, slave trading was active in East Tennessee, with Dr. Joseph Powel (or Powell — he was the father-in-law of Confederate Senator Landon Carter Haynes) trading slaves in Elizabethton and Z.L. Burson trading slaves in Morristown (Carey at 110-11).\n\nAs noted above, there is a tendency to remember slavery as less harsh in Washington County than elsewhere. Cox and Cox quote Ross Smith’s book Reminiscences of an Old Timer: “I do not remember of ever hearing of one being whipped.” (Cox and Cox at 172). However, certainly slaves in Washington County were whipped, although possibly before Ross’s time, as evidenced from newspaper runaway slave ads (Carey at 67 and 238, relating to ad run in 1797-1798 for a slave named Sampson who had a whip mark on his back).\n\nCox and Cox note that many slaves worked as house servants in Washington County, with some engaged as brick masons, seamstresses, blacksmiths, millers or carpenters. (Cox and Cox 172).\n\nProminent slave owners included Chancery Court Judge Seth Lucky, Sheriff Mark Bacon, Postmaster William H. Crouch, and William Cate, a Baptist minister. (Cox and Cox 172).\n\nCarey notes that even those farmers who did not themselves own slaves may have hired enslaved persons on a short-term, paying wages to their masters, often at below-market (relative to a free man’s) wages. (Carey at 153). This meant that those who could not afford slaves still had temporary access to their labor. As noted, hired slaves were used to build the ET&V, as well as other Tennessee “internal improvements.” In addition to the state and local governments, who profited from slavery both from taxes and from owning them directly (see Carey at 173-180, including slaves owned by the State who quarried the limestone for the state capitol building), the banking industry in Tennessee was highly dependent on slave loans (Carey at 169). As noted, slaves were also given away as lottery prizes until lotteries were banned in the 1834 constitution (Carey; see also Introductory Materials for the 1834 Constitution).\n\nIn reviewing the federal (WPA) slave narratives that were compiled in the 1930s, I did not find many relating to East Tennessee (and according to a list drawn up by a University of Vermont scholar, none appear to exist for Sullivan or Washington County). A few worth mentioning —\n\nMartha (Brown) Cunningham, interviewed in Oklahoma. This is the narrative of a slaveowner’s daughter from Sevier County, who grew up in Knoxville and recounts:\n\n“Our mother and father treated our slaves good. They ate what we ate, and they stayed with us a long time after the War. I remember though all of the slave; owners weren’t good to their slaves. I have seen ’em take those young fine looking negroes, put them in a pen when they get ready to whip them, strip them and lay them face down, and beat them until white whelps arose on their bodies. Yes, some of them was treated awful mean. I saw mothers sold from their babies, and babies sold from their mothers. They would strip them, put them on the auction block and sell them bid them off just like you would cattle….”\n\nWilliam Davis, interviewed in Texas. This is the narrative of a slave born in Kingston, Tennessee but raised in the Bristol area. His Master, Rev. Jonathan Draper, was a Baptist minister who was involved with a “Washington College” (not clear if this is the one in Washington County, Tennessee, or the Martha Washington College in Abingdon). He relates:\n\n“Bout de first I ‘members real good am where we am in Virginny and Massa John runs de Washington College, in Washington County. I ‘member all de pupils eats at massa’s house and dat de first job I ever had….Dey ain’t no whuppin’ on our place and on Sunday us all go to church, and Massa John do de preachin’. Dey rides in de buggy and us follow in de wagon. De white folks sets in front de church and us in back.”\n\nRachel Cruze, interviewed in Ohio, was a mixed-race daughter of an enslaved woman and the youngest son of her white owner (Maj. William Holden), who was raised a slave in Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, has a fascinating, but extremely long narrative, which I will quote from only briefly:\n\nEverbody leaving the farm had to have a pass. If they didn’t, the old paddyrollers worked on them. Yes, those paddyrollers were poor white trash. Nobody who amounted to anything would go about the country like they did — just like dogs hunting rabbits.\n\nJoseph Leonidas Star, interviewed in Knoxville, a free person of color born in Knoxville:\n\n“The people ’round here calls me “Lee” Star, and I want to tell you, Lee Star is a free-born man. But of course, things bein’ as they were, both my mother and father were slaves. That is for a few years. They lived in Greenville, Tennessee. My mother, Maria Guess, was free’d before the emancipation, by the good words of her young white mistress, who told [’em] all when she was about to die, she wanted ’em to set Maria free, ’cause she didn’t want her little playmate to be nobodys else’s slave. They was playmates you see. My mother was eleven years old when she was freed. When she was about fourteen and my father Henry Dunbar wanted to marry he had to first buy his freedom. In them times a slave couldn’t marry a free’d person. So he bought his freedom from his Marster Lloyd Bullen, and a good friend of Andrew Johnson, the president. My father an’ him was friends too. So he bought his freedom, for just a little of somethin’ I disremember what, ’cause they didn’t aim to make him buy his freedom high. He made good money though. He was a carpenter, blacksmith, shoe maker and knowed a lot more trades. His Master was broadhearted, and good to his slaves, and he let ’em work at anything they want to, when they was done their part of white folks chore-work.”\n\nE. Additional Notes Relating to Abolitionist Activities ca. 1835-1860\n\nAlthough the activities of the manumission societies and newspapers such as Elihu Embree’s Emancipator were largely squashed by the late 1830s, various degrees of resistance continued.\n\nCox and Cox note that local Presbyterians continued to teach local blacks. Moreover, at least two homes in Washington County have been claimed as possible Underground Railroad stops. The Bell-Herrin House in south Johnson City, built in 1837, contains tunnels that may have been used to help slaves fleeing the Carolinas (Cox and Cox at 172, 173). State Historian Walter T. Durham did not include the Bell-Herrin House in his paper on the Underground Railroad in Tennessee, but does include the Kinchen Miller house between Jonesborough and Johnson City as a likely stop:\n\nOn Lone Oak Road between Jonesborough and Johnson City, a two-story brick house built about 1836 was the home of the Kinchen Miller family. According to family\n\nhistory, it was a station on the Underground Railroad. The Millers were Dunkards, a religious faith that opposed slavery and war. The house has a large cellar accessible from inside the first floor through three trap doors. Two tunnels with a combined length of approximately 200 yards led from the cellar toward a nearby creek and a small cave. The trap doors, cellar, and tunnels have sustained succeeding generations’ confidence that the house was truly a station.\n\n(Durham at 80)\n\nRegardless of which houses were used, slaves did escape with the aid of locals:\n\nA Jonesborough slave couple, Willis and Elsie Hamilton, and their two daughters fled in 1842 when they learned their master planned to sell them to a trader. After hiding out at an East Tennessee Underground Railroad depot for five weeks, they were directed to a Quaker family in southern Indiana. They remained with the Quakers for a year during which time their third child was born. Following the Underground Railroad, they relocated northward to Adrian, Michigan, where they were received by Charles and Laura Haviland. Willis farmed twenty acres near Adrian for three years until, with the appearance of slave catchers in the area, they took shelter at farms in Ypsilanti and Monroe. Probably the bounty hunters’ search had been prompted by a letter sent to Jonesborough by Elsie and intercepted by the postmaster, her former owner.\n\n(Durham at 58).\n\nMoreover, whether the activities were consequential or not (and Carey at 34, notes that generally, the “vast majority” of white Tennesseans would not have given aid to escaped slaves), the reputation persisted of Washington County as a den of “infernal firegured abolitions” (quoting a letter from former resident S.G. Woddill, writing from Texas, denouncing his former neighbors after John Brown’s raid of Harper’s Ferry in 1859) (Cox and Cox at 174). This aroused panic both within the county and the state. For example, in 1839, the Elizabethton Whig (edited by the fiercely-partisan and ever-feuding Parson W.G. Brownlow) denounced the new editor of the Jonesborough Sentinel, Rev. John Lawton, as an abolitionist (West Tennessean). This affair was discussed in papers across the state (see for example, The Nashville Republican Banner).\n\nIt goes without saying that the decade before the Civil War was a time of paranoia in Tennessee relating to the activities of anti-slavery organizations. As Carey notes, “Tennessee newspapers not only defended slavery, but they also mocked people who were critical of it and even accused them of being traitors.” He continues (at 188):\n\nThe best example of this was this was the so-called slave insurrection of 1856. In the fall of 1856, rumors of an armed slave rebellion among ironworkers swirled around Montgomery and Stewart Counties. The events were said to have occurred because of publicity associated with Republican John Fremont, the first openly anti-slavery candidate nominated to a major ticket (the Republican Party). In November, the Clarksville Jeffersonian reported that at least eight slaves and an English carpenter (who allegedly encouraged slaves to rebel) had been arrested over a plot to blow up a white church near the Louisa Furnace in Montgomery County. The account of the plot turned out to be false, but that didn’t stop a slave named Britton from being killed in the hysteria.\n\nA few weeks later there was news of a plot in Stewart County in which slaves were reportedly planning to “kill the white men and children at the forge, seize the white women as wives, and then link up with the slaves from the Cumberland rolling mill for a joint rush on Dover.” As a result of this second panic, many slaves were interrogated and whipped, and some number of them killed. Again, however, there does not appear to have ever been massive, organized slave insurrection, contrary to reports by many newspapers at the time.\n\nSources:\n\nRuth Barrett (student), Abolitionist Literature and the Mails in Jackson’s Time (thesis) (1950) available online at: https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1478&context=studentwork\n\nW.
