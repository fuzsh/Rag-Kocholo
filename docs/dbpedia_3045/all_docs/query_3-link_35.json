Born in Virginia, Richards was 6′ 1″ tall with a dark complexion, dark eyes and “mixed hair” when he enlisted at Gordonsville, Virginia, as a lieutenant, on April 17, 1861, the same day that he was commissioned into Company C of the 13th Virginia. On July 1, 1861, he was promoted to second lieutenant and became first lieutenant on April 23, 1862. He was promoted to captain on May 15, 1863, and was posted to acting commander of his unit on September 29, 1864. On October 19, 1864, he was wounded by a round ball in the left thigh at the Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia, taken as a prisoner of war two days later, and confined at Fort McHenry, Maryland. On October 24, 1864, he was moved to Fort Delaware, Delaware. The muster roll for December 1864 notes that he was released from the U.S. General Hospital (West Building’s Baltimore Hospital) on December 9, 1864, and returned to Fort Delaware where he remained incarcerated until he took the oath of allegiance on June 17, 1865, at which time he was released. His last address was in Brooklyn. He died while in St. Peter’s Hospital using the name of Richard Richardson. Section 81, lot 5615.\n\nRICHARDS, SAMUEL (1836-1905). First lieutenant, 13th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company E. Originally from England, he served for three months in 1861 with the 13th Regiment.

He became a member of the G.A.R. Rankin Post #10 in 1880. His last residence was 267 Pearl Street, Brooklyn. Richardson died of diphtheria. Section 11, lot 12297.\n\nRICHARDSON, LINDSAY R. (1839-1873). Private, 7th Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company K. Born in Dublin, Ireland, to American parents, Richardson was educated in France and came to the United States for business as a young adult. According to the History of the Seventh Regiment of New York, 1806-1889 (Chapter 54, 1873), Richardson served with the 7th Regiment in 1861 and marched with his comrades to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn civilian life, Richardson was a dealer in diamonds and precious stones, a field in which he was admired and in which he achieved success. He remained active in the National Guard becoming a corporal in 1865, a first lieutenant in 1867 and a captain in 1868. As captain, he was known as a disciplinarian and military instructor; his company was one of the largest and most well-regarded in the regiment. He was praised for his intelligence, impartiality, energy and geniality.\n\nThe Veterans’ Association of Richardson’s regiment noted upon his death, “No officer of this regiment has ever achieved a more brilliant reputation or displayed more distinguished military ability. As an accomplished gentleman, as a genial companion and as a faithful friend, he endeared himself to his company and to the officers and members of this regiment, and all unite in honoring his memory.” The members of the regiment were detailed as a funeral escort and asked to wear full uniform (white trousers) when they assembled at the Armory. The funeral took place at the Church of the Ascension on Fifth Avenue and the funeral procession passed down Broadway. Masonic ceremonies were conducted at Green-Wood and Company K fired three volleys over his grave as a final lament. Resolutions of condolence were sent to his family and Richardson’s company room at the 7th Armory was draped in mourning for thirty days after his death. He last lived at 41 West 10th Street in Manhattan. He succumbed after a short but severe illness. Section 70, lot 7467.\n\nRICHARDSON, RICHARD (1839-1910). Seaman, United States Navy. Richardson was an African-American Creole who was 5’7″ and listed his trade as a mariner when he enlisted in the Navy at New York City for a three year term on April 10, 1865. He last resided at 74 Grand Street in Manhattan. Bronchitis was the cause of his death. Section 190, lot 18430.\n\nRICHARDSON, WILLIAM (1822-1893). Major and paymaster, United States Volunteers Paymaster’s Department. A native of Hertfordshire, England, he served as an apprentice to a lawyer in London before immigrating to the United States in 1834, settling first in Ohio. In 1854, he moved to Albany, New York, and was active in the formation of the first Republican State Committee. His interests ranged from prohibition and temperance to the Anti-Nebraska and Free Soil movements.\n\nAfter serving as a clerk of the New York State Assembly and as Speaker of the Assembly, Richardson was appointed paymaster by President Lincoln with the rank of major during the Civil War. He enlisted on June 1, 1861, and was commissioned that day into the United States Volunteers Paymaster’s Department as its major. He served in New Orleans, Louisiana, and according to a descendant, collected ballots for Lincoln during the 1864 election from New York sailors in South Carolina’s waters. On September 30, 1864, he resigned.\n\nRichardson’s political connections served him well after the Civil War when he became president of the Dry Dock, East Broadway, and Battery Railroad Company of New York City, turning a struggling institution into a multi-million dollar company that controlled eleven New York City railroad lines. His effort to become a state senator was unsuccessful. He last lived at 125 South Oxford Street in Brooklyn. Richardson’s death was caused by pneumonia. Section N, lot 24000.\n\nRICHFORD, JOHN (1843-1902). Private, 17th New York Infantry, Company E. Richford enlisted as a private at New York City on May 2, 1861, mustered into the 17th New York on May 21, and mustered out on June 2, 1863, at New York City. In 1891, he applied for and was granted an invalid pension, certificate 828,431. His last residence was 62 Nelson Street in Brooklyn. In 1903, his widow, Mary E. Richford, who is interred with him, was awarded a pension, certificate 545,080. He succumbed to tuberculosis. Section 43, lot 2465, grave 1.\n\nRICHMOND, DUNCAN (1835-1864). Captain 159th New York, Companies K and H; sergeant, 11th New York Infantry, Company C. In 1860, Richmond, a Connecticut native who lived at 461 Hicks Street in Brooklyn with his brother and was a silver-plater by trade, left his profession and became a firefighter at the Franklin Engine Company No. 3, located at 53 Henry Street. On April 20, 1861, he enlisted as a sergeant and mustered into the 11th New York, also known as the First Fire Zouaves or, most famously, the Ellsworth Zouaves, proudly wearing his firefighter’s badge on his uniform. According to Kevin D. Canberg, who researched and wrote about Richmond’s life and provided the information for this biography, the regiment was comprised of New York firemen, who were, at the time, considered the strongest and fittest men available to serve in the Union army. Men from Richmond’s firehouse and another nearby firehouse on Remsen Street, were part of Company C.\n\nAt the Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, at the charge on Henry House Hill on July 21, 1861, Richmond was one of 68 members of his company who were captured and first imprisoned at Richmond, Virginia. He and ten others were transferred to Castle Pinckney, South Carolina, and held there until they were paroled in May 1862. After mustering out on August 7, 1862, Richmond re-enlisted as a second lieutenant at Brooklyn a month later on September 18, and was commissioned into Company K of the 159th New York on November 3, recruiting fellow Brooklyn firefighters to fill Company K’s ranks. The 159th fought at Irish Bend and at the siege of Port Hudson, both along the Mississippi River in Louisiana, as well as smaller engagements throughout the Louisiana region. Richmond never failed to volunteer for hazardous duty (including a near-suicidal assault on Port Hudson dubbed “Forlorn Hope” that Union leadership wisely aborted), earning commendations and praise from his commanding officer. For this courage, he was promoted twice in less than a year: first to first lieutenant on March 1, 1863, effective upon his transfer to Company H and then to captain on February 20, 1864, upon which he returned to Company K.\n\nAfter almost two years of fighting in Louisiana, the 159th was recalled to Washington, D.C., in July of 1864, and then reassigned to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Richmond led his company through several battles in Sheridan’s decisive campaign, including Third Winchester, Fisher Hill, and Cedar Creek. At Cedar Creek, on October 19, 1864, Richmond was gravely wounded while leading his men in a defense against a Rebel charge on a breastwork behind which his men were positioned. After being removed to a field hospital, he succumbed to his wounds 11 days later. Captain William F. Tiemann wrote about his demise in 159th New York’s Regimental History, “Captain Duncan Richmond…was also killed, and the loss was most severely felt by the entire regiment. Pleasant and genial in his manner, kind to and thoughtful of his men, brave as the bravest, we could ill afford to lose so gallant an officer. He fell just as success was assured to our arms. None more worthy gave his life for his country.”\n\nRichmond’s funeral, complete with much fanfare, was held at Plymouth Church in early November of 1864– even poet Walt Whitman, apparently a neighborhood acquaintance of the Richmond brothers, would make note of the sad event in his diary. The funeral procession, which ran from Plymouth Church along Hicks Street to Richmond’s final resting place at Green-Wood Cemetery, was an impressive event that included friends, relatives, a company of New York National Guard troops, Franklin Engine Co. 3, Lodge 288, and the Brooklyn Band. After the Freemasons, of which he was a master, performed their ancient rites and his fellow soldiers fired a volley at graveside, Richmond was buried. Duncan Richmond’s Brooklyn fireman’s badge, which he had worn so proudly into battle, was lost sometime in 1863 in the vicinity of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It remained buried in the Louisiana soil for 145 years until its discovery, worn but intact, in 2008. Acquired by Kevin D. Canberg in 2009, it now resides in the collection of Kevin J. Canberg, Kevin’s father, who like Richmond, served Brooklyn, his home, as a firefighter. Section 158, lot 15518.\n\nRICHMOND, WILLIAM H. (1841-1872). Second lieutenant, 142nd New York Infantry, Company C. After Richmond enlisted as a corporal on August 13, 1862, at Waddington, New York, he mustered into the 142nd New York on September 29. He was promoted to sergeant on April 15, 1863, to second lieutenant on March 18, 1865, and mustered out at Raleigh, North Carolina, on June 7, 1865. His last residence was 59 Quincy Street in Brooklyn, New York. Consumption was the cause of his death. Section 59, lot 1474, grave 10.\n\nRICHTER, JULIUS (1821-1881). Private, 4th New York Cavalry, Companies B and D. Born in France, Richter served as a private in the 4th New York Cavalry in Companies B and D. His military record indicates other service but further details are unknown. He last lived at 504 East 11th Street in Manhattan. His death in 1881 was attributed to erysipelas, a bacterial skin infection. Section 2, lot 5499, grave 1260.\n\nRICKARD, JOHN (1814-1872). Private, 70th New York Infantry, Company C.

Born in Germany, he enlisted as a private on February 29, 1864, at the Ninth Congressional District, and mustered into the 13th New York Cavalry on that day. Although military records list him as a deserter on May 14, 1864, that may not be correct, because, according to his obituary, he was a member of the Adam Goss Post #330 of the G.A.R. and the National Veterans League after the War. He last resided at 261 South 2nd Street in Brooklyn. He died from cancer. Section 135, lot 27263, grave 207.\n\nRIESE, CHARLES (1839-1938).

His death was caused by arteriosclerosis. Section 167, lot 16258.\n\nRIGGS, GEORGE S. (1829-1904). Private, 83rd New York Infantry, Company E. Riggs enlisted and mustered into the 83rd at New York City on May 27, 1861, and was discharged for disability on November 26, 1862.

He returned to service on June 13, 1863, was commissioned into the same unit and company (then part of the National Guard) on that date, and mustered out after 30 days on July 22 at Brooklyn.

His maternal grandfather, John Van Arsdale, served with General Lafayette during the American Revolution. When Lafayette returned to visit the United States in 1824, throngs of Americans came to meet him at the Battery in New York City, among them John Van Arsdale, who was so pleased when he was recognized by the renowned French hero. Van Arsdales’s daughter, Elizabeth, had given birth to a son the day before (August 15), and he asked her to give his grandson the middle name “Lafayette.” John Lafayette Riker’s wife, Ann Eliza Elder Riker (who is buried in Section 57, lot 2340), died in 1851 and their son, John Lafayette, Jr., died in 1854, leaving him with a teenage daughter, Anna, when the Civil War began.\n\nActive in the American Party, Riker was a lawyer before joining the 62nd New York Infantry, the Anderson Zouaves, at Saltersville, New Jersey, in July 1861. The regiment served in the Army of the Potomac and the troops were enthusiastically addressed by Colonel Riker as per an article in The New York Times on July 2, 1861. The aforementioned article noted that the 62nd Regiment was comprised of 950 men and were expected to head to Washington, D.C., during the upcoming week. In March 1862, Riker was court-martialed on a variety of charges including neglect of duty, creating a false muster roll, extorting money from sutlers, trying to sell a commission, and the most controversial, keeping a woman in his tent. During the testimony, many attested to their knowledge of the aforementioned woman, who was dressed as a man and named “Walter Harold” on the rolls; ultimately, he was acquitted of all charges. As per a descendant, Riker’s daughter, Anna, was also at the front lines with her father; the young girl of about 13 or 14, had no mother and so was a witness to the conflict.\n\nAfter rejoining the regiment, Riker led his troops in Virginia at Fortress Monroe and at Williamsburg. He was killed at the Battle of Fair Oaks in Virginia on May 31, 1862. Mortally wounded, his last words were, “Boys, we’re surrounded-give them some cold steel.” His aide, Lieutenant Bradley, described Colonel Riker’s action in the encounter as magnificent, “the coolness of the colonel, in the most trying situations, being absolutely marvelous.” On June 5, 1862, Lieutenant Colonel David J. Nevin, 62nd New York, cited Riker’s valor when he wrote from the battlefield that the regiment was fired upon once the Confederates saw their colors, “Shortly after forming in line Col[onel] J[ohn] Lafayette Riker was killed while gallantly cheering on his men to save the battery, which was threatened at the time by the enemy. In Colonel Riker’s death we have sustained a heavy loss, as he was a gallant and brave officer.” Brigadier General Erasmus Keyes, United States Army, eulogized him in his field report of June 13, 1862, “The losses in the Sixty-second were not so great as in some of the other regiments; its conduct was good, and its colonel, J. Lafayette Riker, whose signal bravery was remarked, met a glorious death while attacking the enemy at the head of his regiment…”\n\nRiker was an honorary member of the Mechanic Hook and Ladder Company, a group that had many members in Anderson’s Zouaves. His body lay in state in the Governor’s Room at City Hall before a military escort brought his remains to Green-Wood. According to a descendant, Anna’s great-granddaughter, one of John’s brothers, Charles Bodle Riker, became Anna’s guardian and filed a minor’s pension on her behalf. His wife’s parents, George and Hannah Elder, of Stamford, Connecticut, also played an active role in their granddaughter’s upbringing after Riker died and were the hosts at Anna’s wedding to Samuel Crump on June 30, 1868; Crump was a printer of multicolored labels for cans of food, an innovation of that era. Originally interred in lot 4259, Riker was moved to the current location at Green-Wood on December 4, 1869. Post #62 of the G.A.R., in New York County, was named in his honor.\n\nJohn Riker’s brother, James Riker, an historian and author, wrote a volume about Captain Van Arsdale’s recollections and the story of how John Lafayette Riker got his middle name; the book is entitled: Evacuation Day, 1783, Its Many Stirring Events With Recollections Of Capt. John Van Arsdale, Of The Veteran Corps of Artillery, By Whose Efforts On That Day The Enemy Were Circumvented, And The American Flag Successfully Raised On The Battery, With Illustrative Notes (originally published in 1883, reprinted in 2007). Anna Riker Crump’s son, Samuel, fought and died in France during World War I; he was buried at Somme American Cemetery, a cenotaph honors his memory at Green-Wood, where his parents are interred.

Assistant quartermaster and commissary of subsistence, 67th North Carolina Infantry; captain 1st North Carolina Local Defense Infantry, Confederate States of America. Robinson was born in Washington, North Carolina. After enlisting as a captain on an unknown date, Robinson was commissioned into the Field and Staff of the 1st North Carolina Local Defense Infantry on September 20, 1863. In the fall of 1863, Governor Zebulon Vance of North Carolina recommended Robinson to Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon for a commission in the Confederate forces as a quartermaster–a promotion from his position in the North Carolina state forces. A fellow captain and quartermaster seconded this recommendation in a letter dated October 17, 1863, “Capt. Robinson is serving in a section immediately bordering the enemy lines, and with the facilities that will be afforded him by Confederate Officers can secure much property that would in all probability be lost to the service otherwise.” Apparently, Robinson did not get that position—as of his return of February 1864, he remained the assistant quartermaster of the 67th North Carolina Infantry; his soldier record lists the date of that transfer as January 18, 1864. The history of the 67th North Carolina indicates that it was organized in January of 1864 and that Robinson, of Beaufort, was its quartermaster. Although his name appears as the 19th North Carolina as of March 1864 as assistant quartermaster, it is noted that that appointment was declined. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, which confirms his service in the 67th North Carolina, he was commissioned as a major in a Virginia regiment just prior to the end of the Civil War; his soldier records have no indication of that promotion.\n\nRobinson married Mary Hoyt of North Carolina in 1865. As per the 1870 census, he lived in Baltimore, Maryland, with his wife and young children; he was a merchant whose real estate was valued at $2,000 and whose personal property was worth $800. In civilian life, he was a member of the New York Cotton Exchange as of 1876, where he held many leadership positions and served as its president for two terms. As per the 1880 census, Robinson lived with his wife and six children at 38 Cambridge Street in Brooklyn and was a cotton merchant. The 1900 census indicates that he lived at 153 Hancock Street in Brooklyn with his wife and four adult children; he still worked as a cotton broker. At the time of the 1905 New York State census, he was a cotton broker living with his wife in Brooklyn. The 1910 census shows him as having been married for 44 years, living in a rental with his wife on Washington Avenue in Brooklyn and still working as a cotton broker. Robinson was a member of St. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church. His funeral took place at the Church of the Messiah at Greene and Clermont Avenue in Brooklyn. He last lived at the Mohawk Hotel and died at Long Island College Hospital. Section 197, lot 33565.\n\nROBINSON, WILLIAM (1836-1899). Artificer, 1st New York Engineers, Company D.

He mustered into the 1st Engineers on September 13, 1864. On April 15, 1865, he re-enlisted at Hart’s Island, New York Harbor. His muster roll for that enlistment shows that he was 5′ 7¾” tall with blue eyes, brown hair, and a fair complexion. A bounty of $33.33 was paid to him at that time.

Born in New York City, he studied in France and Germany according to his obituary in The New York Times. During the Civil War, he served for 30 days with the 7th Regiment in 1861.

In 1906, his pension application was approved, certificate 1,130,350, as was the application of his widow in 1913, certificate 758,043. He last lived at 54 East 66th Street in Manhattan. He succumbed to angina pectoris. Section 149, lot 17204.\n\nROBINSON, WILLIAM R. (1830-1889). Surgeon, Madison’s 3rd Arizona Brigade; private, Milam County Guards Confederate States of America. Originally from Stonington, Connecticut, Robinson was the son of a New York ship broker. His paternal great-great grandfather was William Robinson, an early governor of Rhode Island. Robinson was admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point on July 1, 1846, but resigned on January 6, 1847; he was re-admitted on July 1, 1847, but resigned on June 27, 1848, with deficiencies in math and French. At the time of his admission to the New York University Medical School in 1855, he listed his residence as California; it is possible he travelled there during the Gold Rush. Robinson obtained his degree in 1857, and was recommended by Dr. Valentine Mott (see) for his first job as a physician at the Seamen’s Retreat Hospital in Staten Island. When he obtained a passport in 1859, he was 5′ 11¾” tall with hazel eyes, a very prominent nose, small mouth, light hair, fair complexion, high forehead, and oval face.\n\nRobinson lived with his parents at the time of the 1860 census but was a resident of Port Sullivan, Texas, on February 11, 1861, when he wrote to his father, “My bread is cast on the waters of the South.” On April 28, 1861, he wrote to his father, “War has commenced! Abe Lincoln has thrown the first stone! The South will fight to the last….” He feared a long and bloody battle and that his patients would be unable to pay him because they would be unable to sell their cotton. After joining a Texas Militia unit a week later as a private in the Milam County Guards, part of the 27th Brigade, his name was later stricken from the rolls. Subsequently, Robinson was an acting assistant surgeon in Galveston as of December 12, 1861, hoping for a more permanent position with DeBray’s Mounted Battalion. Documents confirm that Robinson was a surgeon at the General Hospital in Hempstead, Texas, from May through September 1862; from October 1862-January 1863, he was a surgeon at the Columbus, Texas, General Hospital. As per an article in the Galveston Weekly News on January 13, 1864, Dr. Robinson treated 410 patients at the Confederate States Hospital at Columbus as of its opening on October 15, 1863, 26 died of disease (e.g., typhoid, pneumonia, phthisis).\n\nOn February 13, 1863, Robinson was appointed surgeon in Madison’s 3rd Arizona Brigade, a group centered around Confederate attempts to control the southwestern territories but one that never served in the Arizona Territory as originally planned. Robinson was listed on its roster at the brigade’s headquarters in Columbus, Texas. Columbus was a staging area for Confederate troops, especially cavalry units. The Arizona Brigade camped in Columbus that winter; there many of the frontiersmen recruits were accused of insubordinate acts against local citizens. Robinson’s service was then marked by controversy and documents that raise many unanswered questions. One record dated July 15, 1863, summoned him to the Provost Marshal’s Office in Brashear City, Louisiana, by way of ferry boat with one horse. There is no further information about that court-martial but in January of 1864, he was sent to Mexico “on professional business.” The Confederates then sent him to Louisiana and possibly New York on August 3 “into enemy lines.”\n\nUltimately, Robinson was at Ship’s Island, Mississippi, as of November 4, 1864, as a contract surgeon at the Union prison there. While on a pass to New Orleans on January 10, 1865, he wrote to his mother, “At present I am on duty at Ships Island Miss. in charge of hospital for prisoners of war. My health appears to be Iron Clad-nothing has affected it.” He concluded his letter, “I am now anxiously looking forward to the times when we will once more be together. It is soon at hand.” On June 5, 1865, he wrote to Governor J. Madison Wills of Louisiana asking for a position in the Charity Hospital or any available medical appointment.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Robinson was listed as a physician in Newark, New Jersey, in 1868, practiced in Michigan as of 1870, and returned to Newark in 1872. He then lived with his widowed mother and siblings in Newark from 1880 until his death. He was listed as a physician in the Newark City Directory in 1889.

Born in Aberdeen, Scotland, he first trained as a carriage-maker under his father and then apprenticed and became a clock-maker. He immigrated to New York City in 1822 and took up his trade, first on Chatham Street and then at 410 Broadway. He made clocks, high-grade watches, and similar items; in 1840, he received a silver medal from the American Institute Fair for designing a device that measured revolutions of a steam engine. Rodgers also designed a machine in 1844 that was a pre-cursor to the sewing machine. More than 50 large public clocks and ship chronometers of his design were displayed in New York City in his heyday, although none are in existence today. Among his famous designs were the massive clock at Trinity Church in Manhattan (1846), the largest dial-clock at that time, purchased for the handsome sum of $4,344 and gold medal winner at the 1846 American Institute Fair.\n\nRodgers won many awards for his work through the years, was official regulator of the Brooklyn City Hall Clock in the 1850s, and designed the clock for New York’s City Hall in 1859. In a series of letters in September and October 1859, Rodgers was questioned about the clock that he designed for the cupola of Brooklyn’s City Hall in 1853 when he submitted a bid of $2,500 for a new clock at City Hall, New York, after the Brooklyn clock was deemed worthless and taken down. Rodgers, who wrote that he put up that clock at a low price, noted that he took care of it for four years, and knew that Brooklynites loved “the old clock.” Rodgers, who supplied testimonials attesting to his ability and workmanship, attributed the problems with the 1853 clock to vibrations of the cupola and hoped that the Street Commissioner would award him the new contract. He also designed the clock at the entrance gate to Green-Wood Cemetery (1861).\n\nAt the age of 60, Rodgers enlisted as a quartermaster at Albany, New York, on March 31, 1863, and was commissioned into the 15th New York Heavy Artillery’s Field and Staff on April 15, 1863. He mustered out on June 25 of that year at New York City. Continuing in his trade after the War, he designed the clock at Grand Central Station (1871).

Born in Dorset, England, where he served as an apprentice in the merchant marine, Roper enlisted in the United States Navy as an able seaman at New York on October 7, 1861, on the USS North Carolina. At the time of enlistment, he recorded his occupation as sailor. He was initially assigned to the bark USS Braziliera in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. He was 5′ 4½” tall with grey eyes, brown hair and a fair complexion. On either December 31, 1861, or January 1, 1862, he was transferred to the frigate USS Congress.\n\nIn late January or early February 1862, at Newport News, Virginia, Roper fell down a snow-covered hatch. According to his affidavit for an invalid pension, he was injured in the small of his back, sapping his strength and leaving a permanent mark. Unable to get up from his hammock the next morning, he was carried to the ship’s hospital, where he spent about six weeks.\n\nOn March 8, 1862, not long after Roper’s release from sick bay, the Congress came under attack and was set ablaze by the ironclad CSS Virginia (which had been the USS Merrimack before its capture and refitting) at Hampton Roads, Virginia. The following day, the Merrimack was engaged by the USS Monitor while the Union ironclad protected the grounded and badly damaged USS Minnesota, to which Roper had been reassigned upon the sinking of the Congress the previous evening. This engagement was the iconic “Battle of the ironclads.” After serving about a month on the Minnesota, Roper was reassigned to the Braziliera, serving until April 20, 1863. He was discharged from the Navy on the USS Princeton at Philadelphia on May 15, 1863.\n\nRoper is listed in a New York directory as “mariner” (date unknown) and at the time of his second marriage in 1867, but listed his occupation as watchman when he applied for a pension from the Navy in 1890 in which he cited a disability from weakness in the arm and back.

He enlisted as a second lieutenant on April 26, 1861, was commissioned into the 7th Infantry of the United States Army that day, and was promoted to first lieutenant a month later on May 23.\n\nBrigadier General D. H. Rucker, United States Army, in his field report describing the actions from April 20-July 7, 1862, wrote, “On the 20th day of April I directed Lieutenant [Edward] Ross to proceed to Aquia Creek, Va., for the purpose of establishing a depot of supplies at that point. Under his supervision warehouses were erected and arrangements commenced for the receipt, handling, and protection of stores; and the U. S. Military Railroad Department having constructed wharves, re-laid the track, and rebuilt the bridges on the road from Aquia Creek to Fredericksburg…” He took sick there in July and died of typhoid fever in Washington, D.C., on July 23, 1862. Section 95, lot 5736.\n\nROSS, ELIJAH A. (1828-1879). Acting master, United States Navy. Born in North Yarmouth, Maine, Ross was registered as a member of the American Ship Masters’ Association on December 4, 1861, and served as acting master in the Navy aboard the USS Oneida from the following December 28 until August 1864. During that period, the Oneida was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, under the command of Admiral David Farragut, during the blockade of Mobile Bay, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana. In a significant Union victory, the Oneida, commanded by Captain Samuel Phillips Lee, along with three other Union ships, pursued and defeated Confederate gunboats in April 1862 on the Mississippi River near New Orleans. The only blemish on the day was severe damage to the Oneida during the engagement. On October 9, 1862, Ross provided testimony at a court inquiry into the conduct of the Oneida’s then commander, George Henry Preble, for failing to prevent the Confederate steamer Oreto from running the blockade of the harbor of Mobile. The inquiry resulted in Preble’s dismissal, which was later reversed by President Lincoln. Ross tendered his resignation from the Navy on August 11, 1864, due to heart problems and rheumatism, and it was accepted by Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy.\n\nIn 1878, Ross’s occupation was listed as stevedore on his marriage certificate.

Using that alias, he enlisted as a private at New York City on August 18, 1861, served in the 4th New York Heavy Artillery, and was discharged on January 15, 1865.\n\nAccording to Marie Ross’s 1891 application for widow’s pension from the Navy, Robert Ross re-enlisted in the Navy on March 29, 1865, and was discharged on July 13, 1868. That pension application also indicates that he re-enlisted in the Navy under the name of James D. Ross (date unknown) and was discharged in April 1890. She also applied for a widow’s pension for her husband’s service in the Artillery in 1891, application 524,416, but that request was transferred to the U.S. Navy; her pension from the Navy was awarded under certificate 12,254. His death was caused by Bright’s disease. A badly-eroded marble gravestone marks his burial site, probably placed there circa 1900. Section 206, lot 21347 grave 698.\n\nROSS, NATHANIEL H.

He last resided on 4th Street in Brooklyn. He died of acute cardiac dilatation. Section 186, lot 18146.\n\nROSS, WILLIAM JOHN (1833-1886).

His last residence was 9 Debevoise Place in Brooklyn. His death was attributed to aortic insufficiency. Section 146, lot 25170.\n\nROTHERT, WILLIAM (1841-1862). Private, 9th New York Infantry, Company D. Rothert is not buried at Green-Wood; the cenotaph to him at the cemetery honors his memory. Rothert was born in New York City. His birth year is unclear based on his cenotaph which differs from census records and the final soldier papers. The 1850 census indicates that he was living in New York City with his parents and younger sister; William was attending school. As per the 1855 New York State census, 10-year-old William was living in New York City with his parents, three younger sisters and two boarders.\n\nAfter enlisting at New York City on April 23, 1861, he mustered into the 9th New York the next month, on May 4. As per his muster roll, Rothert was paid by New York State $3.96 for his service from April 23 through May 3, 1861. He was killed on September 17, 1862, at the Battle of Antietam, Maryland.\n\nAs per the list of his clothing, description and final statement, Rothert was 19 years old, 5′ 6½” tall with gray eyes, dark hair and a medium complexion. That document, signed by the first lieutenant of his company, notes that he was a clerk, had signed up to serve two years and was last paid on June 30, 1862, with monies due to the date of his death. In addition, he owed the United States 87 cents for clothing; other personal effects were sent home.\n\nRothert’s diary, in which he records experiences serving in Virginia and sketches of his Zouave uniform, is at the New-York Historical Society. Harold Holzer, in his The Civil War in 50 Objects, describes that 83-page diary as “one of the most remarkable of all Civil War journals.” Kept form August 1861 into July 1862, Holzer describes it as a meticulous daily account, “providing an important record of both routine life in camp and the jolting horror of battle action.” Holzer notes:\n\nOn the eighty-three pages on which he wrote his surviving entries and drew his little pictures, Rothert recorded meticulous details about daily weather conditions and shed light on the often boring routine of army life. Although at first he saw little action himself, he did get to see a famous general or two, spied an occasional rebel, nearly drowned, made some mischief, endured mild punishment for his transgressions, went hungry, marked his twentieth birthday amid death and a freak accident in camp, and witnessed the arrival of escaped slaves seeking safety and freedom in the Union lines—fugitives he dismissed with racial epithets typical of the time. The summer heat was brutal, the fall winds bitter, the marches exhausting, the physical labor tiresome, and the rumors rife and often exaggerated, but Rothert’s occasionally banal notations open a valuable window onto the life of a volunteer soldier on coastal duty during the first summer and fall of the Civil War—as the following excerpts show. And they culminate with a gripping account of Rothert’s first battle action during General Ambrose E. Burnside’s successful expedition to set up a Union stronghold along the coast of North Carolina. The history books show that Burnside succeeded in capturing Roanoke Island, where he seized thirty-two heavy guns and twenty-six hundred prisoners, then took New Berne, Beaufort, and Fort Macon. For these successes, Burnside earned promotion to major general. For his part, the Zouave private William Rothert gained no such acknowledgment—only the experience of a lifetime. As they say, he “saw the elephant.”\n\nHolzer quotes at length from young Rothert’s diary:\n\n1861\n\nCamp Butler\n\nThurs Aug 1st [A]ll the liquor was thrown away by order of Gen But[ler]\n\nFriday Aug 2nd Very fine and pleasant, warm eleven shots were fired at the pickets none of them taking effect.\n\nThursday Aug 8.
