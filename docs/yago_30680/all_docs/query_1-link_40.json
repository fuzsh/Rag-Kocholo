        "text": "French Religious Wars\n\nMassacre of the Huguenots, 1573 The Italian artist Giorgio Vasari depicts the Saint Bartholomewâs Day massacre in Paris, one of many bloody events in the religious wars that accompanied the Reformation. Here Admiral Coligny, a leader of the French Protestants (called Huguenots), is hurled from a window while his followers are slaughtered. This fresco was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII to decorate a hall in the Vatican Palace in Rome. Both sides used visual images to win followers and celebrate their victories.â(Giorgio Vasari [1511â 1574], Sala Regia, Apostolic Palace, Vatican City/De Agostini Picture Library/The Bridgeman Art Library)\n\nThe costs of the Habsburg- Valois wars, waged intermittently through the first half of the sixteenth century, forced the French to increase taxes and borrow heavily. King Francis Iâs treaty with the pope (see âFranceâ) gave the French crown a rich supplement of money and offices and also a vested financial interest in Catholicism. Significant numbers of French people, however, were attracted to the âreformed religion,â as Calvinism was called. Calvinism drew converts from among reform- minded members of the Catholic clergy, the industrious middle classes, and artisan groups. Additionally, some French nobles became Calvinist, either because of religious conviction or because this allowed them to oppose the monarchy. By the middle of the sixteenth century perhaps one- tenth of the French population had become Huguenots, the name given to French Calvinists.\n\nBoth Calvinists and Catholics believed that the othersâ books, services, and ministers polluted the community. Preachers communicated these ideas in sermons, triggering violence at the baptisms, marriages, and funerals of the other faith. Armed clashes between Catholic royalist nobles and Calvinist antimonarchical nobles occurred in many parts of France.\n\nCalvinist teachings called the power of sacred images into question, and mobs in many cities destroyed statues, stained- glass windows, and paintings. Though it was often inspired by fiery Protestant sermons, this iconoclasm is an example of men and women carrying out the Reformation themselves, rethinking the churchâs system of meaning. Catholic mobs responded by defending the sacred images, and crowds on both sides killed their opponents, often in gruesome ways.\n\nA savage Catholic attack on Calvinists in Paris on August 24, 1572 â Saint Bartholomewâs Day â followed the usual pattern. The occasion was the marriage of the kingâs sister Margaret of Valois to the Protestant Henry of Navarre, which was intended to help reconcile Catholics and Huguenots. Instead Huguenot wedding guests in Paris were massacred, and other Protestants were slaughtered by mobs. Violence spread to the provinces, where thousands were killed. The Saint Bartholomewâs Day massacre led to a civil war that dragged on for fifteen years. As a result, agriculture in many areas was destroyed, commercial life declined severely, and starvation and death haunted the land.\n\nWhat ultimately saved France was a small group of moderates of both faiths called politiques (POH- lee- teeks) who believed that only the restoration of a strong monarchy could reverse the trend toward collapse. The politiques also favored officially recognizing the Huguenots. The death of the French queen Catherine deâ Medici, followed by the assassination of her son King Henry III, paved the way for the accession of Henry of Navarre (the unfortunate bridegroom of the Saint Bartholomewâs Day massacre), a politique who became Henry IV (r. 1589â 1610).\n\nHenryâs willingness to sacrifice religious principles to political necessity saved France. He converted to Catholicism but also, in 1598, issued the Edict of Nantes (nahnt), which granted liberty of conscience (freedom of thought) and liberty of public worship to Huguenots in 150 fortified towns. By helping restore internal peace in France, the reign of Henry IV and the Edict of Nantes paved the way for French kings to claim absolute power in the seventeenth century."
