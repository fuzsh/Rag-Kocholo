        "text": "So Henry IV of France was married to his cousin Margaret of Valois in 1572, and their marriage was annulled in 1599, however, what I am wondering is, what might happen if they have children? How might him having children earlier influence the wars of religion and his own succession to the french throne, if indeed it does happen?

His religion (Calvinism) was the reason most of the country did not support him, and not his lack of children.\n\nHaving said that, the post-Henri IV France could be quite different. Would his son agree to convert to Catholicism? I would assume so, but I imagine he might share his father's tolerant attitude, in contrast to Louis XIII, who adopted some heavy-handed policies that helped provoke the renewed religious warfare in the 1620s.\n\nConversely, if his son doesn't convert to Catholicism, then France could have a big mess on its hands. Henri IV and the Dauphin might become estranged and there almost certainly will be renewed warfare upon the Dauphin's accession.\n\nI'm not sure his having children would have affected the Wars of Religion; either way he's got to wait his turn until all the Valois guys die off unless he can somehow overthrow them (which is pretty much impossible).

If it's the 1573-born son, that would be during the period when Henri de Navarre was a de facto prisoner of the royal court. The boy's religion would probably come down to whether or not Henri could take him when he escaped from court.\n\nThe others would have been born when Henri was living in Huguenot-controlled territory and presumably would be raised Protestant.\n\nI suppose that's possible.

But with with children who are half the blood of the previous regime, there would definitely be some more ease in his accession.

How might having an adult Heir effect his policies do you think?\n\nAlso would the dauphin convert do you think?\n\nI doubt Henry of Navarre will be ever able to keep his children with him or decide anything about their education.
