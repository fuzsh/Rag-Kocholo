        "text": "Recently, we had some discuss about Henri III/IV and his first wife Marguerite having children and the consequences for French succession.\n\nBut what if these two do NOT marry in the first place?\n\nLet's say Charles IX and Catherine de Medici renounce to the controversial idea of this marriage. What are the consequences?\n\nFirst of all, the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre is butterflied away.\n\nIt implies the Protestants are probably more powerful than in OTL. However, it may also imply less Catholics are willing to side with them without the trauma of the massacre. Would the Malcontents still exist?\n\nIt also implies Coligny does not die in 1572. He wanted France to support Protestant rebels in Netherlands. What about that?\n\nAlso, if Henri and Marguerite do not marry each other, who do they marry?\n\nBefore Marguerite's OTL marriage, Sebastian I of Portugal had been considered as a potential suitor for her. What are the chances for this marriage to finally occur?\n\nAlternatively, what about the possibility of an Austrian husband ?\n\nI have no knowledge of some potential bride considered for Henri before his marriage to Marguerite. I guess he may simply marry some German Protestant princess but that would hardly reinforce his position in France.\n\nIs there a woman high ranked enough for him, with interesting connections in France and willing to marry a Protestant? I though to Eleonora d'Este, daughter of Renée de France (who was Protestant) and sister of Anna d'Este, duchess of Guise. But I guess she is too old for him.\n\nWhoever is his wife, Henri is likely to have a legitimate son. And said son has chances to be Protestant. That would lead to massive trouble if butterflies do not give a legitimate son to one of the Valois brothers. Would Henri's son convert to Catholicism like him? If not, what about French succession?\n\nWould Henri's son convert to Catholicism like him?\n\nHenry was born in 1553, married Marguerite in 1572, inherited the crown at the assassination of Henry III in 1589, and converted to be accepted as King in 1593.\n\nIf he doesn't marry Marguerite, he marries someone else, very probably a Protestant.\n\nThe St. Bartholomew's Day massacre is pre-empted (this is a hard knock-on, not a \"butterfly\"). That in turn may avert the decline and death in 1574 of Charles IX, who was very disturbed by the Massacre and subsequent bloodshed. Charles may have had TB, and thus was unlikely to live long, but living longer, may father more children, including sons. If so, his younger brother, OTL-Henry III, will stay in Poland as its King, and Henry of Navarre will not be heir presumptive.\n\nThus lots of knock-ons. And of course no Massacre has direct knock-ons, i.e. Admiral de Coligny is not killed.\n\nGetting back to Charles IV - he had a daughter, Marie Elisabeth, who died four years after his death, aged five. If he lives another ten years but has no sons... OTL his wife (ME's mother) was sent back to Austria when he died; ITTL she stays in France, which should butterfly ME's death. It's 1584. Charles' brother Henry has been off in Poland for 12 years, and is notoriously gay to boot. Henry of Navarre is next, and he's in France, but is a Protestant. HoN is 33, and could have a 12-year-old son *Louis, who would be next in line. Marie Elisabeth is 11. Suppose *Louis marries Marie Elisabeth and is immediately crowned, i.e. both Henry Valois and HoN are passed over. *Louis has to convert, but HoN doesn't mind: \"Paris is worth a Mass\".\n\nAlternately: everything goes as OTL, except that the Catholics find some other occasion for the Massacre, and HoN marries someone else and has a son *Louis in 1574. In 1593, when HoN converts, *Louis is 19. HoN tells him to convert also - but *Louis refuses. Now what?\n\nWell, Marie of Cleves, OTL obsession of Henri III of France, was raised by Jeanne d'Albret and married off to a cousin of Henri III of Navarre. Here, without negotiations for Marguerite (who could marry either Sebastian of Portugal OR Philip II of Spain as was discussed after her sister's death), Jeanne may decide that the beautiful, well-connected girl she's raised herself would make a good consort for her son. Catherine de Parthenay would be a fun bride, but you'd have to kill off her first husband in a different massacre. Charlotte de Bourbon (or her sister Louise, who never married) is his cousin and a little older than him, but she's a well connected domestic bride. Louise of Lorraine, OTL bride of Henri III of France, is also a decent possibility, as a well connected but not particularly compelling domestic choice.\n\nMarie Eleonore of Cleves or her sisters Sybille and Magdalene are pretty good foreign choices (with ties to the Hapsburgs to boot!). Maxmiliana Maria of Bavaria is a well connected foreign bride that might work. Maria of Nassau or her sister Anna would be interesting choice,s particularly if Catherine de Medici's match between Marguerite and Philip II of Spain goes through and people think the Valois relationship with the Hapsburgs is against French interests, as the timeframe would most likely work in with the Prince of Orange's aggression against the Hapsburgs. One of the daughters of Philibert of Baden-Baden, Jakobea (OTL Duchess of Cleves-Julich-Berg), Anna Maria or Maria Salome are all viable candidates there. Hell, in a scenario where Marguerite isn't free, Charles IX of France may see that marriage as providing for the daughter of a friend who died fighting on his side.\n\nIMO the most likely matches are Marie of Cleves, Charlotte/Louise de Bourbon, or one of the Nassau sisters.\n\nThe St. Bartholomew's Day massacre is pre-empted (this is a hard knock-on, not a \"butterfly\"). That in turn may avert the decline and death in 1574 of Charles IX, who was very disturbed by the Massacre and subsequent bloodshed. Charles may have had TB, and thus was unlikely to live long, but living longer, may father more children, including sons. If so, his younger brother, OTL-Henry III, will stay in Poland as its King, and Henry of Navarre will not be heir presumptive.\n\nGetting back to Charles IV - he had a daughter, Marie Elisabeth, who died four years after his death, aged five. If he lives another ten years but has no sons... OTL his wife (ME's mother) was sent back to Austria when he died; ITTL she stays in France, which should butterfly ME's death.\n\nHow longer may Charles IX survive? Ten years sounds very optimistic. Even without the massacre, he would still have tuberculosis. But, yes, if he lives a little longer, he may produce a legitimate son.\n\nThen, OTL Henri III stays in Poland, Stephen Báthory stays in Transylvania and Sigismund Vasa stays in Sweden. (Believe it or not but I had not even considered that when I opened this thread.)\n\nI guess Transylvania would be okay. What are the consequences for Poland and Sweden? Henri disliked Poland but he would likely adapt with time. He would have no choice. The problem is that he wanted more authority than Polish nobility wanted to give him. As for Sweden, Sigismund would be the Catholic king of a Lutheran country.\n\nTwo difficult situations.\n\nMarie-Elisabeth had tuberculosis like her daddy. Why would her death be butterflied away simply because of her mother being there?\n\nCharles' brother Henry has been off in Poland for 12 years, and is notoriously gay to boot.\n\nThis Henri was not \"notoriously gay\". He was a womanizer.\n\nWho would he marry, here? He was supposed to marry Anna Jagiellon but did not want to do it as she was much older than him and likely close to menopause. To secure the throne of Poland, he would need a Jagiellon descendant. However, considering who we are talking about, I guess it is entirely possible that he would just do what he wants and still marry Louise de Lorraine anyway.\n\nHoN is 33, and could have a 12-year-old son *Louis, who would be next in line.\n\nI think Louis is an unlikely choice of name for a son of Henri at this time.\n\nAlternately: everything goes as OTL, except that the Catholics find some other occasion for the Massacre\n\nThe Catholic did not search an \"occasion\". The massacre occured because of how frightened Catholic Parisians were to have so many Protestants in Paris, coming to attend the wedding.\n\nTo have the same conditions, you need to find a reason for these Protestants to come to Paris.\n\nWell, Marie of Cleves, OTL obsession of Henri III of France, was raised by Jeanne d'Albret and married off to a cousin of Henri III of Navarre. Here, without negotiations for Marguerite (who could marry either Sebastian of Portugal OR Philip II of Spain as was discussed after her sister's death), Jeanne may decide that the beautiful, well-connected girl she's raised herself would make a good consort for her son. Catherine de Parthenay would be a fun bride, but you'd have to kill off her first husband in a different massacre. Charlotte de Bourbon (or her sister Louise, who never married) is his cousin and a little older than him, but she's a well connected domestic bride. Louise of Lorraine, OTL bride of Henri III of France, is also a decent possibility, as a well connected but not particularly compelling domestic choice.\n\nMarie Eleonore of Cleves or her sisters Sybille and Magdalene are pretty good foreign choices (with ties to the Hapsburgs to boot!). Maxmiliana Maria of Bavaria is a well connected foreign bride that might work. Maria of Nassau or her sister Anna would be interesting choice,s particularly if Catherine de Medici's match between Marguerite and Philip II of Spain goes through and people think the Valois relationship with the Hapsburgs is against French interests, as the timeframe would most likely work in with the Prince of Orange's aggression against the Hapsburgs. One of the daughters of Philibert of Baden-Baden, Jakobea (OTL Duchess of Cleves-Julich-Berg), Anna Maria or Maria Salome are all viable candidates there. Hell, in a scenario where Marguerite isn't free, Charles IX of France may see that marriage as providing for the daughter of a friend who died fighting on his side.\n\nIMO the most likely matches are Marie of Cleves, Charlotte/Louise de Bourbon, or one of the Nassau sisters.\n\nInteresting.\n\nIs Catherine de Parthenay high ranked enough? Also, would Louise de Lorraine, Maxmiliana Maria of Bavaria or Louise de Bourbon marry a Protestant? How likely are the marriages with one of the Cleves sisters, Nassau sisters or Baden-Baden sisters? Would it provide advantages to Henri in France? Marie de Clèves or Charlotte de Bourbon would make sense, I guess.\n\nWhat about Marguerite? Philip II married Anna of Austria in 1570, so he is not available. Would Marguerite marry Sebastian I? Or a Habsburg from Austria? Or someone else?\n\nWait, I'm confused with the names...explain this again please?\n\nMarie de Clèves had been raised by Jeanne d'Albret, her aunt-in-law. (Jeanne' husband Antoine de Bourbon and Marie's mother Marguerite de Bourbon were siblings).\n\nJeanne was the one who decided Marie's marriage to the prince of Condé (who was Marie's first cousin, his father being another brother of Antoine and Marguerite).\n\nThey went to Paris to attend the wedding of Henri de Navarre and Marguerite de France. After the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre, they were kept prisoners at French court and forced to convert to Catholicism. Henri, duke of Anjou, future Henri III, fell in love with Marie. However, he was elected king of Poland and had to go.\n\nAfter his departure, the prince of Condé impregnated Marie. But he escaped soon after, letting her pregnant in French court. Then, he came back to Protestantism.\n\nWhen Henri III came back from Poland, he hoped to obtain the annulment of Marie's marriage, using the difference of religion as a pretext (Marie was now Catholic while her husband was Protestant). However, Marie died in childbirth.\n\nHenri III was devastated but he still had to marry in order to produce an heir. Catherine de Medici wanted him to marry the sister of the king of Sweden. He refused and decided to marry Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont, a young woman he had met during his travel to Poland. It was sometimes said that he had chosen her because she had some physical resemblance to Marie.\n\nWell, with a wife he is passionately in love with, perhaps they can even have issue\n\nThis was never the problem with Louise. They tried to produce children for years. It is mostly believed Louise became infertile due to an infection she developped after having a miscarriage soon after the marriage.\n\nBefore Marguerite's OTL marriage, Sebastian I of Portugal had been considered as a potential suitor for her. What are the chances for this marriage to finally occur?\n\nAlternatively, what about the possibility of an Austrian husband ?\n\nHow about Margot to Guise? She was making eyes at him OTL IIRC\n\nI have no knowledge of some potential bride considered for Henri before his marriage to Marguerite. I guess he may simply marry some German Protestant princess but that would hardly reinforce his position in France.\n\nDidn't Henri equate marrying a German to \"going to bed with a wine barrel\" OTL though?\n\nIs there a woman high ranked enough for him, with interesting connections in France and willing to marry a Protestant?\n\nWhat about one of the de la Marck girls? One of them married the prince de Condé OTL. Alternately, Catherine de Medicis apparently considered Christine of Lorraine as a viable replacement for Henri OTL.\n\nAs to a d'Este girl, it's unlikely. After the whole Françoise de Rohan-duc de Nemours he-said-she-said marriage Jeanne d'Albret took her cousin's side and promised Renée (very publicly) that \"never shall I allow such poisoned lips as yours [Renée] to kiss me/my hand again\". So I don't see a match like that happening in the 1570s (does this affect Jeanne's OTL death? ISTR that somehow there was a link - or perceived link - between her death and Henri's marriage OTL).\n\nA Swedish match may also be an option. It sounds like a stretch, but OTL there was talk of one between Henri III and Elisabeth Vasa, it foundered because of Henri's refusal to renounce Louise of Lorraine. Then, there was talk of a match between Charles IX of Sweden's eldest daughter and the duc de Rohan. It doesn't really do much for Henri's position in France, but that could be why France lets it happen. Both sides would be unable to do anything to help the other.\n\nA match to one of Willem the Silent's daughters or a daughter of the Elector Palatine could also potentially happen. I wonder if, due to his religion and potential Dutch ties (if he marries a Nassau), Henri of Navarre gets involved in the Netherlands instead of d'Alençon?\n\nHow about Margot to Guise? She was making eyes at him OTL IIRC\n\nDidn't Henri equate marrying a German to \"going to bed with a wine barrel\" OTL though?\n\nWhat about one of the de la Marck girls? One of them married the prince de Condé OTL.

I wonder if, due to his religion and potential Dutch ties (if he marries a Nassau), Henri of Navarre gets involved in the Netherlands instead of d'Alençon?\n\nHenri's feelings on German ladies will matter absolutely not at all if needs come to be...I don't think Henri will be involved in Netherlands though"
