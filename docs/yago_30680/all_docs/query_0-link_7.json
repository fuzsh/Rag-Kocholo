She was born in France, and she was Queen of France and Navarre from 1572 to 1599. Margaret of Valois, Queen Margot Margaret of Valois was married to Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV, in 1572. This marriage was a political marriage, intended to appease religious tensions between Catholics and Protestants in France. However, the marriage was a failure, and the two spouses lived apart for much of the time. In 1589, Henry of Navarre became King of France under the name of Henry IV. He divorced Margaret of Valois in 1599, and she was imprisoned in the ChÃ¢teau d'Usson in Auvergne until her death in 1615.
