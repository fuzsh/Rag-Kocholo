When he was born, Henry was baptised in the Catholic faith, but his mother brought him up as a Protestant. His mother died on 9th June 1572 and Henry became King of Navarre.\n\nMargaret, or Marguerite, of Valois was born on 14th May 1553. She was the daughter of King Henry II of France and his wife, Catherine de' Medici, and the sister of Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III, all Kings of France. She was brought up in the Catholic faith.\n\nThe aim of this marriage was to unite the Bourbon and Valois families, and also to bring peace between the Catholics and Huguenots in France. However, the awful St Bartholomew's Day Massacre of the Huguenots took place just six days after the wedding.\n\nAn estimated 3,000 French Protestants (Huguenots) were massacred in Paris, and a further estimated 7,000 in the provinces. According to tradition, Catherine de' Medici persuaded her son, King Charles IX of France, to order the assassination of key Huguenot leaders who had gathered in Paris for the wedding Henry and Margaret.\n\nRead more about the massacre here.\n\nAlso on this day in Tudor history..."
