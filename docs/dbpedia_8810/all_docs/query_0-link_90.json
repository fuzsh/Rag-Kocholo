Now waiting for my next read to drop through the letterbox.\n\nJ - United Kingdom\n\nWill definitely use again!\n\nGreat experience and I have zero concerns. They communicated through the shipping process and if there was any hiccups in it, they let me know. Books arrived in perfect condition as well as being fairly priced. 10/10 recommend. I will definitely shop here again!\n\nT - United States\n\nThe shipping was just superior\n\nThe shipping was just superior; not even one of the books was in contact with the shipping box -anywhere-, not even a corner or the bottom, so all the books arrived in perfect condition. The international shipping took around 2 weeks, so pretty great too.\n\nR - Spain\n\nFound a hard to get bookâ€¦\n\nFinding a hard to get book on Booksplease and with it not being an over inflated price was great. Ordering was really easy with updates on despatch. The book was packaged well and in great condition. I will certainly use them again.\n\nJ - United Kingdom"
