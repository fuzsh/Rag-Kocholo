        "text": "Wealthy real estate mogul Arthur Zeckendorf has called off his engagement to New York socialite Anne Detwiler, multiple sources have confirmed to Page Six.\n\nZeckendorf is the developer of the iconic 15 Central Park West, and, with his brother William Lie Zeckendorf, owns Zeckendorf Realty and real estate brokerage firm Terra Holdings, which owns Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead.\n\nThey are currently working on the Robert Stern-designed 520 Park Avenue.\n\nArthur announced his engagement to Detwiler, the wealthy granddaughter of Dwayne Andreas, chairman of agricultural product giant Archer Daniels Midland, a year ago.\n\nBut sources say they broke off their engagement late last year, with one explaining, “They are two independent people, and things didn’t really work out between them.”\n\nA spokesman for Arthur Zeckendorf — whose real estate pioneer father William Zeckendorf Jr. passed away at 84 last year — declined to comment, and Detwiler couldn’t immediately be reached Wednesday night."
