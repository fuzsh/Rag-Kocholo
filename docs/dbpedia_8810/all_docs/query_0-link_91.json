        "text": "The book, titled “America’s Twelve Master Salesmen,” was written and published by B.C. Forbes & Sons in 1953.\n\nThe book was based on the fact that each one of these master salesmen had one extremely powerful overriding principle or philosophy upon which his or her success was based.\n\nFor the last two weeks I have presented the first nine masters, and this week the final three (plus me). There are 12.5 in all (me being the .5 of course)\n\nSuppose you could adopt (or adapt) all of these master’s single best characteristic into your own set of capabilities. That would be power.\n\nAnd so, to challenge the rest of your year, here are three more master’s philosophies from 1953\n\nWilliam Zeckendorf Principle: Fact plus imagination plus action. Will Rogers once said, “Buy land, they’re not making any more of it.” William Zeckendorf took that advice several steps further. He bought it, and developed it. Of course his innovative ideas often met with opposition from city planners, but over time (and a winning track record) he developed a reputation nationwide for successful projects, and was eventually wooed by cities looking for new ideas. He stated the facts, presented the plan — and made it a success with a family tradition: work hard. NOTE: He bought, then subsequently sold The Chrysler Building, the ultimate deco structure in New York City, that at one time was the tallest building in the world.\n\nThomas J. Watson Principle: Pack your today’s with effort – extra effort. He was a salesman and later corporate officer for NCR under the tutelage of John Patterson. “No. I don’t want to buy a cash register.” “I know you don’t. That’s why I came to see you. I knew if you wanted one you would come down to the office and pick one out. What I’ve come for is to find out why you don’t want one.” Watson realized that to overcome an objection, he had to walk in with answers – this took extra preparation on the part of the salesman – extra effort. Was the extra effort he put into his sales career worth it? He went door to door selling cash registers, and invented creative new ways to approach the customer. After leaving NCR as one of their all time great salespeople, you may also know Watson for his second career – the founder of another company – IBM. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time, and was called the world’s greatest salesman when he died in 1956.\n\nElmer G. Leterman Principle: Neglected customers never buy: They just fade away. This principle merges the significance of three relationship factors of customer loyalty:\n\ngiving value to the customer\n\nstaying in front of the customer\n\nserving the customer\n\nHe added to this strategy the personal philosophy of: “I have adhered to a personal rule of trying to do for the other fellow what he can’t do for himself – without any strings attached.” He wrote. Leterman was also the first to write on sales creativity in the 1950’s: “Personal Power Through Creative Selling.” Elmer Leterman was one of the best sales speakers, sales writers, and progressive strategists of his time. He is my personal favorite. This book title will tell you why”The Sale Begins When the Customer Says “No.”\n\n12.5 Jeffrey Gitomer Principle: People don’t like to be sold but they love to buy. Unlike the other masters, my statement is not only the philosophy by which I live my sales life, it is also a registered trademark. If salespeople would just stop selling, and transfer that energy into creating an atmosphere to buy, they (you) would double your sales. Read this book to find out more“The Little Red Book of Selling.”\n\nWell, there’s the list of people and their prime philosophies and principles.\n\nWhat principles are you known by?\n\nWhat is your primary success strategy?\n\nWhat would someone say your philosophy was — if they had to boil it down to one sentence?\n\nWhat have you done to live your philosophy, to brand your philosophy, to make your philosophy known to others by your writings and by your actions?\n\nIf the answer to these questions is painfully obvious to you, perhaps this should be your year of transition. Perhaps this should be a year where you take a closer look at your bigger picture rather than a frustrated look at your quota and monthly sales achievements.\n\nNOTE WELL: If you look at these masters, and you think any of them never had a problem achieving their goals or life’s dreams – think again. Every one of them had failure and adversity in one form or another. Everyone had challenges. These are people who by adopting and living a philosophy or a principal, became successful in spite of adversity. And not successful to you or me, rather successful to themselves – in their own minds, the only place success matters (you may want to adjust your thinking about success as well).\n\nFREE GitBit"
