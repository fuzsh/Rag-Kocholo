        "text": "Nothing out of the ordinary for real estate mogul William Zeckendorf on his latest property move, who has just sold his 740 Park Ave apartment for a grand $29.5 million.\n\nSwooped up by a buyer as recent as June 26 according to Mansion Global, Zeckendorf finally parts ways with one of the most recognized addresses in the city. The co-op originally opened in 1930 after a year of construction during the Great Depression designed by renown Rosario Candela and Arthur Loomis Harmon.\n\nWith residents including John D. Rockefeller Jr. being amongst the list of notable tenants, the history doesn’t just stop there for this address, as Jackie Kennedy Onassis’ grandfather had built the building. Jackie O lived in 740 Park Ave as a child.\n\nZeckendorf had originally purchased the co-op back in 2011 for $27 million from video game developer Gregory Fischbach and wife, Linda. The new owners of Zeckendorf’s apartment have been identified as American businessman Peter May and wife, Leni."
