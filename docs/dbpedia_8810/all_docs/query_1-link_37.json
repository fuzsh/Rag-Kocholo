        "text": "What was the most interesting deal of the century? The answer from some of the most successful real estate figures of the modern age was not a deal, but a man.\n\nSam Zell - \"Zeckendorf. How he operated, how he bought office, created ground leases and separated the real estate interests..Zeckendorf.\"\n\nGerald Hines - \"I was always captivated by Zeckendorf's developments in Montreal. He was a daring developer.\"\n\nMelvin Simon - \"...the most interesting shopping center deals were done by William Zeckendorf, Sr. His development of Roosevelt Field and a major development in Montreal established a pattern for retailing that has lasted to this day.\"\n\nJim Peters - vice chairman of Cushman Wakefield - \"William B. Zeckendorf. Assembled the land for the UN. He was the greatest.\"\n\nWilliam B. Zeckendorf, Sr. had all of the traits of a real estate grand master.\n\nIn 1954, Fortune magazine described him as \"...a gifted man. He has a mind of unusual caliber in intuition, rough calculating ability, and resourcefulness; and an imagination that can take fire without appreciable loss of discipline.\"\n\nZeckendorf first exhibited his acumen with the World War II-era management of John Jacob Astor's $50 million portfolio. After just four years, he had richened the portfolio by $15 million. This was just a taste of what was to come. The list of creative, gutsy and insightful deals is long: buying and operating the Graybar and Chrysler buildings in New York, developing the Roosevelt Field mall in Long Island, Century City in Los Angeles and thousands of luxury and middle-income apartments in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nThe deal Zeckendorf wanted to be remembered for (and most writers and fans oblige him of this) is the acquisition of slaughterhouse property along the East River that eventually became the site for the United Nations. Securing the land alone was an achievement, never mind the millions he made developing the surrounding lots. Reading the story, one feels that the owners of the land hand-picked Zeckendorf for the deal, that he was the only person who could do a deal where everyone won.\n\nThe land was considered unattainable by most of the New York real estate community. Many had tried to wrangle the choice land away from the owners to no avail. The slaughterhouse owners wanted to stay in Manhattan and knew zoning would prohibit relocation inside the city. But as the saying goes, every man has his price. In this case the price was $17 per square foot, some $12 more than adjacent parcels.\n\n\"I know it's a ridiculous price,\" said the broker for the deal, \"but that is what they want.\"\n\nAfter some thought and discussion with his partners the deal was struck at the asking price. Zeckendorf's approach to the \"ridiculous\" price is telling. \"Here is the greatest opportunity I have ever seen in my life...whether the properties around it are selling for $5 per foot, $1 per foot, or half a dollar per foot around this area...has nothing to do with it. If you can think in pro forma terms of X, the slaughterhouses, there is no excuse for the $5 land, and there is no excuse for the $17 land. The whole thing is worth $50. By eliminating the abomination you can pull the whole thing up by its own bootstraps.\"\n\nThe acquisition of the slaughterhouse land was an example of the simple, fundamental truths that are many times uncovered only by rare minds. Zeckendorf's aspirations matched his huge talent. A few ambitious undertakings never got off the ground and there was a mediocre foray to the suburbs later in his life, but no one seems tomention those deals.\n\nWHERE THE MONEY IS Ok, many people argue that the architects have it easy, but the real challenge is paying for all of those grand visions. That's why the money end is so essential to success.\n\nClaude M.
