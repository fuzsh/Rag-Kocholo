        "text": "In 1986, the New York Times called William Zeckendorf Jr. \"Manhattan's most active real-estate developer”. Bill as he was known, had become a titan of the game not only putting up iconic buildings but transforming neglected parts of NY City. His autobiography, on which this piece is written, offers a glimpse inside the high-stakes world of real estate development and a frank assessment of his successes and failures, his public triumphs and equally public setbacks. But most inspiring of all was his rise from the ashes. Coming from one of, of not the most revered property development dynasties, the story of how he clawed his way back to prosperity is inspiring. This story does not cover his entire career spanning 7 hotel refurbishments and 27 buildings but rather only one, his first hotel redevelopment, during a period when he was rebuilding his family's fortunes while managing the calamity that his father William Zeckendorf Snr. – once the world’s most famous and revered property developer, had left him to contend with. I will tell you the story of Mayfair House and list my insights and take-aways.\n\nThe story wouldn’t be complete without mentioning that he learned the ropes under his father, for whom he worked, for 12 years. His gift to his dad was as a competent construction manager and eventual rainmaker who could round up finance. He was also a saviour in situations where funding had dried up and miracles were needed to get construction going. But he was also left standing in the rubble and ruin his father left behind.\n\nThe Mayfair Hotel\n\nBill Snr. possessed a knack for discerning the true value of hotels. He recognized the potential of the Mayfair House, a small hotel nestled at the intersection of Park Avenue and East 65th Street. With its elegant architectural charm and well-heeled clientele, the Mayfair House exuded Old World allure. However, beneath its façade of grandeur lay a neglected reality. The building, nearing its half-century mark, had succumbed to the ravages of time, its upkeep sorely lacking. Its residence hotel status failed to attract sufficient revenue, despite its prime location, which warranted the calibre of a full-service transient hotel.\n\nAs a prelude to their grand renovation, Bill Jr. and his wife decided to dine at the hotel's restaurant, eager to gauge its condition. What they encountered could only be described as a disheartening revelation. It was awful. Despite the dismal dining experience, Bill remained undeterred. He saw not the decrepit relic that was the Mayfair House, but the untapped potential that lay dormant within its walls. He envisioned a hotel revitalized, its grandeur restored, and its restaurant transformed into a culinary hub, attracting discerning clientele from near and far. He believed that with careful restoration and a dash of innovation, the Mayfair House could once again reclaim its place as a beacon of hospitality and fine dining.\n\nHis father arranged for Bill Jr. To meet with John McGrath, chairman of the East New York Savings Bank, who was on the Long Island University board with the old man. He toured the Mayfair and McGrath agreed to finance the purchase of the hotel and the improvements. Having seen the potential in converting it to a transient hotel and upgrading the premises, Bill Jnr. bid higher. He had no money to put into the deal: General Property, as his company was called at the time, was tapped out. But he knew an investor, Sheldon S. (\"Hack\") Wilson. With Hack's equity commitment and the backing of East New York Savings, Bill Jnr. bought the hotel for $6 million. Converting the Mayfair into a transient hotel didn't require major construction, just refurbishing the lobby, hallways, guest rooms, and baths. Most existing residents happy enough to leave once they realised how much foot traffic there would be. But a few decided to stay.\n\nIt was the Mayfair restaurant that interested Bill Jnr. most, however, and after they closed on the hotel, they got a break in that regard. The hotel had been leasing a ground-floor to a doctor who decided to move out. Conveniently, the office was next to the hotel kitchen and had its own entrance on East 65th Street. Adding the office to the existing facility would give them enough space for a proper restaurant. They began construction on the restaurant before they had a chef or manager.\n\nIt was unheard of for a hotel restaurant to compete with New York's top establishments, but that's what they hoped to do. Sirio Maccioni became the owner, and it was a fabulous success. Sirio knew everyone, and everyone knew him. He had just one non-negotiable condition: it had to be his restaurant, with no interference from the hotel. They settled on the amount he would need to take over the space, and Bill consigned his loan.\n\nHe was offered a year rent-free a low rent thereafter.\n\nThe main snag was a neighbour next door, who objected initially to the separate location of the entrance but eventually agreed. But the delay cost time and money. Despite the setbacks, they were able to open Le Cirque on December 1, 1974. The restaurant was an immediate success. Sirio's charm and attention to detail made Le Cirque the place to be for New York's elite. The food was also excellent, thanks to Chef Jean-Jacques Rachou. Overall, the Mayfair was a smashing success.\n\nLessons learned:\n\n· Leverage personal connections and relationships. Bill Jr. was able to get financing from East New York Savings Bank because his father arranged an introduction to the chairman. Having strong networks can open doors.\n\n· Take risks and trust your vision. Bill Jr. saw potential in the rundown Mayfair House that others didn't. Having conviction in your ideas and taking calculated risks is important.\n\n· Bring on the right partners. Finding an equity partner like Hack Wilson and a talented restaurateur like Sirio allowed Bill Jr. to complement his own skills. Surround yourself with people whose capabilities match the vision.\n\n· Overcome obstacles creatively. When the neighbour objected to the separate restaurant entrance, Bill Jr. managed to negotiate an agreement. As a developer, expect unforeseen issues and be solution oriented.\n\n· Sweat the details. Sirio's tireless attention to detail was crucial to Le Cirque's success. Likewise in development, craftsmanship and quality make a difference. Care deeply about your projects.\n\n· Take a long-term view but balance pragmatism. Bill Jr. compromised by giving Sirio an exceptionally generous deal to secure Le Cirque's involvement. Have ambition for what you're building but temper idealism with practicality.\n\n· Know when to preserve history vs. when to innovate. Bill Jr. recognized the architectural charm of the Mayfair House was an asset, so he focused on restoring it. But he also saw room to innovate by converting it to a transient hotel and adding a world-class restaurant. Skillfully blend the old with the new.\n\n· Spot diamonds in the rough. Despite its dilapidated state, Bill Jr. could envision the potential of the Mayfair House based on its location and bones. Train your eye to identify hidden value.\n\n· Be flexible and opportunistic. When the doctor's office space opened, Bill Jr. quickly seized it to expand the restaurant. Keep adapting your plans to capitalize on chances that arise.\n\n· Manage trade-offs. Allowing a separate restaurant entrance to satisfy the neighbour came with downsides like delay and expense. Weigh compromises against overall goals.\n\n· Align incentives through deal terms. By making Le Cirque \"Sirio's restaurant,\" Bill Jr. fuelled his motivation. Structure partnerships to encourage other parties' commitment to success.\n\nBill Jnr. Admitted these were risky times. He leveraged relationships to bring in equity partners and bank financing on every deal. Equity partners took profit share despite fronting all capital. He lacked own capital but offered banks/investors cachet of his name.\n\nThough equity partners gained from his sourced financing, Zeckendorf was solely liable if loans defaulted. Lenders likely required project/partner collateral with recourse loans, leaving his personal assets vulnerable. His high leverage model probably 10-20% equity, 80-90% debt - lifted returns but increased downside risk. UK developers would struggle replicating this, as banks commonly mandate 30%+ equity. Alternate financing like mezzanine loans or institutional partnerships can provide needed leverage. With partners taking fixed profits, Bill Jnr. bore full liability for debt repayment.\n\nAdditional Lessons Learned\n\n· Leverage relationships to raise financing. Zeckendorf could bring in banks/investors through the strength of his name and track record.\n\n· Structure deals creatively if you lack capital. He used 100% partner equity and brought bank financing.\n\n· Misalignment of interests carries risks. Partners got a \"free ride\" while he bore responsibility if things failed.\n\n· Provide collateral or guarantees to secure loans. Lenders likely required projects/partners' assets as collateral with personal liability.\n\n· Recourse loans increase personal risks. He could be personally liable if project sales didn't cover debts.\n\n· High leverage magnifies returns but also risk. 10-20% equity and 80-90% debt optimises returns but has downsides.\n\n· Stress test projects for market changes.\n\n· Turn to creative sources if equity is lacking. Mezzanine loans, second mortgages, bonds etc. provide leverage."
