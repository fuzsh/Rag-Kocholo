Concrete Garage Foundations

Site Prep installs concrete foundations throughout Delaware. We offer foundations for garages, horse barns, pavilions, and sheds. Concrete foundations include concrete piers, block footers, single-pour pads with footers, and simple “floating” pads. Each foundation type is suited to particular building styles. We help each customer design a concrete foundation that meets the needs of their building and the requirements of their municipality.

Shed Demolition

Have an old building you need removed? We can assist with that too! We provide shed demolition services for all types of old sheds and outbuildings. We’ll carefully dismantle/demolish the structure to avoid damage to the surrounding area. All debris will be removed from your property, taking care to leave the area clean and ready for a new shed or other use. Of course, we can always help with installing the foundation for your new shed as well!
