Seton Catholic High Schoolâ€™s annual Volley For Cure (VFC) event was held this past Thursday, September 24th. The evening concluded a month of fundraising efforts to benefit the Indiana Women In Need (IWIN) foundation. Fundraising efforts were led by the Varsity and Junior Varsity Volleyball teams with help from parent volunteer, Tina Reichley. The girls held bake sales, a t-shirt sale, a girl only lock-in for elementary students, and a boys volleyball tournament in addition to the basket give-away and VFC game itself.

IWIN is a foundation that helps identify the needs of individuals who are suffering from breast cancer. These needs are expenses above and beyond the medical needs of the individual like childcare, housekeeping, yard maintenance, massage therapy, exercise classes and meal preparation. Last year the girls were able to raise more than $3300 which helped seven women from Randolph, Franklin, Fayette, Wayne and Delaware counties.

The volleyball teams offer a special thank you to BSN and Team Gear Printing for donating the shirts for the VFC game, Mrs. Jasmine Schroeder for designing the shirts, Mr. Rick Ruhl (principal) and Mr. Trent Tremain (athletic director) for their support, Mrs. Emily Robinson, Mrs. Natalie Blakely, Mrs. Farrah Caskey, and Mrs. Cyndi Poe (secretaries) for their help with distribution of information, and all of the coaches, fans, parents and friends that support their Volley For Cure efforts.

Losing is not an option to these girls or the fight against breast cancer, this year they were able to raise over $3700 for IWIN.
