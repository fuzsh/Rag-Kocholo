Delaware County Council Chair Dr. Monica Taylor presented a resolution to The Foundation for Delaware County during a celebration held on May 19 at the Ellis Preserve to celebrate the organizationâs fifth anniversary.

The resolution was presented to Frances Sheehan, President of The Foundation for Delaware County and Dominic Pileggi, Board Chair for The Foundation for Delaware County, in recognition of the exceptional work the foundation has done over the past five years.

The Foundation for Delaware County was formed in July of 2016 with a goal to partner with nonprofits, businesses, government, and generous individuals to address the challenges in Delaware County. Since its founding, the foundation has been building a permanent civic endowment to benefit Delaware County and offers philanthropic services, convening, grantmaking, and community health programs to address unmet needs in Delaware County including those in food insecurity, affordable housing, racial inequities in birth outcomes, public health, the environment, and crisis response.

âThe County is extremely grateful for our partnership with The Foundation for Delaware County,â said Delaware County Council Chair Dr. Monica Taylor. âOver the past few years, I have worked directly with Frances Sheehan and her team on projects and initiatives that are vital to our residents including Census outreach, supporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy outreach, supporting the County in our launching of the Delaware County Health Department and working in the community since we launched the Health Department earlier this year.â

Since 2016, the Foundation has:

Distributed $9M in grants, scholarships, and charitable care

Raised and awarded $1M through the COVID-19 Response Fund

Awarded 193 grants to nonprofits

Raised $100K to support 2020 Census outreach for the county

Assisted Delaware County Council in administering $3M in Delco Strong grants funded through the federal CARES Act

Connected more than 2,600 generous individuals in Delaware County with opportunities to have an impact in their local community

Served over 10,000 people each year through the foundationâs community health programs

Launched Housing Opportunities Program for Equity (HOPE) to address housing instability through financial assistance to families, case management, financial literacy education, and advocacy for housing reform

Helped to launch the Delaware County Health Department, providing both funding and counsel to the County

âWhile the amount of donations and people served can be tracked and counted, the impact that the foundation has made on Delco residents cannot be measured and nor can their level of passion and dedication,â said Taylor.
