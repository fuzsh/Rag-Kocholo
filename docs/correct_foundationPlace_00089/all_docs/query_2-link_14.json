Beginning July 5, 2002, we began a summer reading and math program to provide additional support to learning, achievement and retention. A study by American Education Research (2020), showed that 52% of students lose an average of 39% of their total high school year gains during the summer months.\n\nStudies also show that 1 out of 7 high-school dropouts end up in the prison system. The primary mission of The ARK Educational Resource Center is to increase the graduation rate, and thereby, significantly reduce the drop-out rate. Studies show that 80% of prisoners are high-school dropouts. This population is subject to higher unemployment rates, poorer health, criminal history, incarceration, public assistance and so on. The quality of life is negatively compromised and these individuals become burdens on the state’s economy that requires rehabilitation, job training, etc.\n\nExamples of services and/or resources this organization can provide with your contribution:\n\nA $100 dollar donation would provide tutor services for a child for a month.\n\nThe ARK serves all of Sussex County but is located in Laurel, DE – the poorest town in the county. Therefore, our palmary stakeholders are from the Laurel area and are a vulnerable population. These stakeholders are traditionally low-income, single parents who cannot afford to pay for tutor services. The ARK uses a sliding scale fee for those who are employed; however, 99% of the parents that we serve do not pay and cannot afford the $100 per month fee for service. We accept everyone who applies to our program and have done so since we opened in 2013. Donations made to our programs would help us provide food snacks, school supplies, and the fees that parents cannot pay due to poverty level income.\n\nCharity Type: Children, Community, Education, Health, Youth Development\n\nWebsite: https://attackaddiction.org\n\nDescription: For more than 11 years, the mission of attack addiction has been to raise awareness about the disease of addiction.

Our work includes creating and maintaining the first Urban Farm in the City of Wilmington, beautifying public landscapes, planting close to 19,000 urban trees, and hosting educational programs and community events. Collaborations with social services, municipal, and government agencies afford DCH the opportunity to continue our mission of inspiring individuals and communities through the power of plants.\n\nDCH’s mission contributes to community building through our strategic pillars: to transform underserved neighborhoods, communities, and individuals; to motivate individuals and communities with an interest in plants and horticulture to improve their surroundings; and to elevate the greater Delaware community resulting in a healthier, safer, and more beautiful environment.\n\nOur population includes everyone from preschool-aged children who explore our backyard garden with their parents, to the older adults who attend an informative workshop or lecture, to the corporate groups and volunteers who serve the community through a tree planting event.

DCH’s public landscapes have a real quantifiable impact: the 23 public sites host 187 unique plant species that support native pollinators; the sites are projected to capture 213 metric tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the next ten years; and 176,456 vehicles pass these beautiful sites on a daily basis.\n\nCOMMUNITY GARDENS & URBAN HORTICULTURE: DCH supports community gardens and helped establish Wilmington’s first urban farm. Located in vacant lots and public spaces, DCH-sponsored community gardens provide children and adults alike a place to learn and grow together. The E.D.

The Farm supports a local food system, providing residents with fresh fruits and vegetables while beautifying the landscape.\n\nCOMMUNITY FORESTRY: Our Community Forestry Program partners with local, state, and federal groups to promote the benefits of urban trees.

Often, low-income communities see higher rates of these than the rest of the state. The combination of these three instances work to destabilize Delaware communities, specifically low-income communities. Stabilized communities are a product of stabilized families, home ownership, positive rental stewardship, and a resident’s overall connection to their community, all of which Family Promise NNCC effectively accomplishes on a regular basis. The majority of the families we serve are simply down on their luck. A job loss or an unexpected bill, in addition to a myriad of other factors, lead them to lose their housing, A foreclosure or an eviction both destabilize communities. Vacant units, specifically for long periods of time, lead to higher rates of crime, infestation, and potential health hazards to neighboring residents. Additionally, areas with high rates of vacancy lower community property values and are often unattractive to potential residents.\n\nFamily Promise NNCC works with families to bolster their capacity to survive independently. A significant portion of individuals living in low income communities lack soft skills necessary to sustainably live independently in the face of stagnant low-income wages, rising housing costs, and surprise costs.
