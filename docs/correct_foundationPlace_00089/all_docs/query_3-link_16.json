        "text": "As a community-owned, not-for-profit hospital, Beebe Healthcare depends on the generous support of individuals, foundations, and businesses. In 1921, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Shaw were responsible for the first major philanthropic gift to Beebe Healthcare which supported the construction and furnishing of a 35-bed medical facility, modern for its time. Beebe Medical Foundation was established on September 14, 1989, with the sole mission of raising philanthropic support for Beebe Healthcare. Donations and endowment gifts, which provide income in perpetuity, ensure the continuance and availability of Beebe Healthcare to the community. New and continuing programs, equipment purchases, and the larger Beebe mission to encourage healthy living and restore optimal health for the people residing, working, or visiting in Sussex County are supported by this funding. The Foundation is located in the historic house of Dr. Richard Beebe who, with his brother Dr. James Beebe, founded Beebe Hospital in 1915. Originally situated on hospital property, the home was moved to its current location on Savannah Road in 1992.\n\nSC-243: Installed in 2014.\n\nLocation:\n\n902 Savannah Road, Lewes, DE 19958\n\nLinks to more resources:\n\nBeebe Medical Foundation celebrates historical marker\n\nBeebe Medical Foundation granted historical marker\n\nBeebe Healthcare: A History of Caring\n\n9200-R17-001 Judith Roales Collection: Beebe Newspaper Clippings\n\nDPA Pamphlet Collection: Beebe"
