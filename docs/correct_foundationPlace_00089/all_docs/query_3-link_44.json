Fair Acres provides individualized skilled nursing care for over 700 residents, ranging in age from young adults to the elderly.\n\nThe 5-Star rating is the highest rating awarded by CMS and has been earned by Fair Acres twice in the past three years, with the highest scores awarded for Overall Quality and Staffing.\n\n“I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of our hardworking Directors and staff,” said Bill D’Amico, Director of the Fair Acres Geriatric Center. “It’s always good to know your work is being recognized, and we’re very pleased to receive five stars from CMS.”\n\nThe 5-Star rating is based on a variety of quality measures, health inspections, staffing ratios, proper documentation, and direct interviews with facility residents to determine the overall performance of the facility.\n\nThe 5-Star designation comes only a little more than six months after Fair Acres was named one of America’s Best Nursing Homes for 2023 by Newsweek.\n\nOut of 11,722 nursing homes analyzed across the country, Newsweek selected the top 4% — just 475 nursing homes — for recognition. Performance data, peer recommendations, the handling of COVID-19, and the facility’s accreditations were taken into consideration, with Fair Acres ranking 25th among Pennsylvania nursing homes.\n\nFair Acres is the largest skilled nursing facility in Delaware County and has been in operation and providing quality care to the residents of Delaware County for over 200 years.\n\nFair Acres provides long-term care for adults, young or old, with a demonstrated need for 24-hour- a-day nursing care and offers short-term rehabilitation as well. In addition, Fair Acres serves as a geriatric training site for local colleges, universities, and nursing schools.\n\nCMS ratings and information about doctors, clinicians, hospitals, nursing homes (including rehab services), home health services, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, dialysis facilities, and hospice care can be accessed on the CMS Care Compare website, which allows individuals to compare health care providers and healthcare settings, providing individuals with the ability to make informed health care decisions.\n\nTo access the Care Compare tool and see their review of Fair Acres and other health care facilities, visit http://www.medicare.gov/care-compare.\n\nRiddle Hospital Pavilion opens to patients\n\nRiddle Hospital, part of Main Line Health, opened its new five-story, 230,000-square-foot Pavilion to patients on Monday, featuring state-of-the-art surgical suites, modern maternity facilities and other expanded health care features.\n\nThe Pavilion is the cornerstone of Riddle’s $327 million campus modernization project — the most significant facility improvement in the hospital’s 60-year history and one of the largest capital investments in Main Line Health’s history. Construction began in 2020.\n\n“This is a facility that matches the quality of our people,” said Jack Lynch, president and CEO, Main Line Health. “It brings them all the tools and capabilities necessary to deliver safe, high-quality and equitable care. I can’t wait to see how our team makes use of this building and the impact it will have on the community we serve.”\n\nThe facility includes 76 private patient rooms and is designed to maximize natural light to brighten the atmosphere for patients.\n\nIt also has 10 modern surgical suites, including two robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery. The new maternity suites and neonatal intensive care unit will allow Riddle to care for 1,800 births a year, an increase of more than half.\n\nOther features include an atrium with new shopping and dining options and a new 174-space parking garage with electrical vehicle charging stations.\n\nA signature feature of the Pavilion is a mosaic mural located in the main lobby. The mural, a collaboration between Riddle Hospital and Project S.N.A.P. (Share, Nurture, Act and Preserve), is the culmination of over 5,000 artworks submitted by staff, patients, donors, and community members.\n\nFrom a short distance, the mosaic appears as a single image reflecting the theme “You Matter Most: Improving the health of the community, today and tomorrow.” A user-friendly kiosk allows you to locate each person’s contribution to the mosaic.\n\nPure Project Management oversaw the Pavilion project. Other project partners were CallisonRTKL, architect; P. Agnes Inc., construction; and Ballinger, engineer.\n\nAdditional parts of the campus modernization project are continuing, with completion scheduled for summer 2024.\n\nWork includes renovations to the existing hospital’s intensive care unit and other care and support areas.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.mainlinehealth.org/locations/riddle-hospital.\n\nReaders can send community news and photos to Peg DeGrassa at pdegrassa@21st-centurymedia.com."
