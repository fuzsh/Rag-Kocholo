The fund is designed to provide protection for Delaware's precious resources, now and in the future. Donors' gifts are managed responsibly, and have the greatest possible impact because of the creativity and spirit of resourcefulness that the fund fosters.

Trees are planted in designated areas within the parks in spring and autumn. All state parks are potential sites for donations to this program.\n\nThe funds received in the Memorial Tree Program are used to purchase trees to serve as a living reminder of the special people in our lives and to reforest areas of state parks. Donors may elect to fully fund the purchase or a tree or choose to donate towards a tree planted on behalf of multiple persons. In order to preserve the natural beauty of our facilities, individual trees are not marked or identified as part of this program. Instead, a plaque is hung in the State Park Office acknowledging the names of all those for whom the memorial trees were planted. The names remain on the plaque for a year following the planting of the trees.\n\nFor more information about the Memorial Tree Program, call (302) 739-9220 or e-mail Delaware State Parks Information."
