        "text": "On average, Wilmington homeowners spend roughly $3,162 on foundation repair. The total cost of foundation repair is based on a number of factors. Things like the extent of the damage, the type of repair needed, and the size of your home will all factor in. The easiest way to find out how much a job could cost is to talk to a local foundation repair company and schedule a free inspection and estimate.\n\nThe main types of foundation repair are crack repair, leak repair, underpinning, stabilization, and waterproofing.\n\nCrack repair and leak repair are what they sound like: your foundation repair expert will perform an inspection and complete any repairs necessary to remedy cracks or leaks. The price will vary depending on the size and cause of the issue.\n\nUnderpinning, also called leveling or piering, is the process of leveling your foundation by underpinning it with large concrete piers. The cost will depend on how many piers are required. The price of stabilization varies similarly. This process fixes bowing walls by reinforcing them with steel or carbon fiber strips. The cost will depend on the material chosen and how many strips are used.\n\nFinally, waterproofing is an overarching term for a number of jobs that help stop water from getting into your foundation. This can include exterior waterproofing, interior waterproofing, or both, and costs can vary widely. We recommend contacting a waterproofing specialist if you think your foundation needs waterproofing.\n\nWhen constructing a new house, have a soil report completed. This report contains information regarding how well your soil can support a foundation, and can provide you with a heads-up about potential future problems. If your concerns are about an existing house, a few hundred dollars will cover an inspection and report by a structural engineer. The engineer can point you to any things that could use some attention, and advise you on avoiding future problems.\n\nAlso ensure that the moisture around your foundation is appropriate. Don't let the soil around your Wilmington home get too dry or too wet; at different times, you might find yourself having to reroute your gutters or water your foundation. You should also stay vigilant for leaky pipes or gutters, so you can get them repaired quickly.\n\nYou might not love the idea of spending money to hire someone for what appears to be a small foundation repair. However, it's always in your best interest to consult a professional. This helps you avoid potential future issues that could be even more expensive. You may be able to take care of small hairline cracks on your own, but it's always in your best interest to get an expert opinion first.\n\nAlthough some foundation problems might appear small and not worth the cost to repair, when left untreated, they can result in much larger and more expensive problems down the road. Foundation problems may have underlying causes which are not clear until after a professional inspection. It's important to repair these underlying issues as soon as possible. For these reasons, we recommend you don't procrastinate on foundation repairs."
