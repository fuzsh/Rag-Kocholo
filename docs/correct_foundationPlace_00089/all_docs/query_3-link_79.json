        "text": "Authorized by Congress with the passage of the 2016 Delaware River Basin Conservation Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Delaware River Basin Restoration Program takes a non-regulatory approach to landscape-scale conservation: it is voluntary, incentive driven, and builds upon existing collaboration by partners throughout the four-state watershed.\n\nThe Program reflects a shared vision for conserving and restoring a network of lands and waters to support wildlife, and is guided by a strategic framework developed with partners to focus on conservation in four key areas: reducing flooding and runoff, restoring fish and wildlife habitats, improving water quality, and enhancing safe recreational access for the public.\n\nRead the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program Framework to learn more about the program's vision, strategic goals, and focal areas.\n\nDelaware Watershed Conservation Fund\n\nIn 2018, the Service and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation launched the Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund as the first step toward advancing the goals of the Act. The Fund supports projects that address conservation needs today, and tomorrow. Watch this video to hear from partners about how the fund is helping to advance their work in the watershed.\n\nDelaware River Watershed Conservation Collaborative\n\nIn 2021, the Service facilitated the establishment of the Delaware River Watershed Conservation Collaborative (DRWCC), a voluntary partnership that will set funding priorities to ensure investments reflect shared goals and contribute to landscape-scale conservation gains.\n\nYou can read the Collaborativeâ€™s Mission and Vision document and read the Collaborative's By-Laws to learn more about this partnership.\n\nThe Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund supports a diversity of projects that contribute to the social health and economic vitality of the communities in the Delaware River watershed. These grants will result in significant, measurable benefits for people and wildlife in the watershed.\n\nTo date, the fund has awarded $55.1 million to 195 projects that support recreation, water quality, water management, and habitat. The grantees have generated $79.2 million in match, for a total conservation impact of $134.3 million. The projects have already resulted in tangible conservation outcomes, including:\n\n76 miles of streams restored\n\n1,339 acres of wetlands conserved and enhanced\n\n6,052 acres with public access\n\n29,321 acres of forest under improved management\n\nYou can explore all of the funded projects in our interactive map, or view summaries below of the grant projects that have been funded each year:\n\n2018 Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund grant slate\n\n2019 Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund grant slate\n\n2020 Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund grant slate\n\n2021 Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund grant slate\n\n2022 Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund grant slate\n\n2023 Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund grant slate\n\nProjects supported by the Fund complement and leverage investments by states and non-profit partners, including through the Highlands Conservation Act Grant Program to support land conservation, and the William Penn Foundation's Delaware River Restoration Fund grants to support restoration.\n\nThe National Fish and Wildlife Foundation administers the complementary Delaware River Restoration Fund and the Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund through its Delaware River Program."
