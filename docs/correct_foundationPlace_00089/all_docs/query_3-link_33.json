        "text": "Foundation Soil Problems in Delmarva\n\nWe can repair damage caused by weak soils, expanding soils, and hydrostatic pressure\n\nStair step cracks on walls are a common sign of foundation problems caused by settlement and soil issues.\n\nIf you've seen cracks in your foundation walls or floors, have bowing or buckling walls, or are dealing with uneven floors, your first instinct is to blame the foundation and the way it was built. However, the real cause of the issue may not actually be your foundation, but the soils around it.\n\nWhen a foundation is dug out and poured, the removed soil is replaced as backfill. Unfortunately, this process can weaken the soil around the foundation and eventually lead to problems. For many homeowners, this is an unknown source of trouble.
