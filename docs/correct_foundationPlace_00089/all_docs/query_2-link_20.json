        "text": "The Delaware Restaurant Foundation (DRF) was founded in 2014 in response to the ongoing need for sustainable training and education initiatives within the restaurant and hospitality industries in Delaware. The restaurant industry in Delaware is growing steadily, and currently accounts for 11% of the entire workforce, over 53,000 jobs, and $2.0 billion dollars in annual sales. During the next 10 years, the restaurant industry is projected to add over 1.7 million jobs, 6,000 of which will be in Delaware. The primary focus of the DRF is to strengthen the industry workforce by educating and mentoring the next generation of industry leaders. The cornerstone initiative of the DRF is the ProStart Program, a comprehensive, career-building program that blends industry-driven classroom learning with mentored work experience, giving ProStart a “professional start” for students that may not have been interested in traditional career paths. The program gives them the skills and confidence necessary to become successful leaders in their chosen industries and communities.\n\nIn tandem with its mission to fortify the industry workforce, the DRF places a special emphasis on inclusivity and diversity, recognizing the potential within individuals of all abilities. With our restaurant employer partners, the DRF is leading the way by bringing value to apprenticeship in our industry through its various pre-apprenticeship partners. Inspired by the belief that talent knows no bounds, the foundation actively seeks to create opportunities for justice-involved individuals and those from under-represented communities. By fostering an environment that values and supports the unique contributions of every aspiring professional, the DRF aims to make the industry more accessible and inclusive for individuals with varying backgrounds and abilities.​"
