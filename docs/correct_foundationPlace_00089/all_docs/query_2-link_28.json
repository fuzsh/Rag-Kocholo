        "text": "About Ronald McDonald House Charities\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities of Greater Delaware is part of a global charity, Ronald McDonald House Charities. The roots of this global charity are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHow it all started\n\nWhen an unlikely partnership was formed in Philadelphia in 1974 between an NFL team, a children’s hospital and a restaurant chain, none of its members could have imagined that their dream of a “home -away-from-home” for families of seriously ill children would grow to become an international phenomenon. They wanted to create a place where parents of sick children could be with others who understood each others’ situations and could provide emotional support.\n\nThe seeds of the partnership were planted when Kim Hill, the 3-year-old daughter of Philadelphia Eagles tight end Fred Hill, was diagnosed with leukemia. Hill and his wife camped out on hospital chairs and benches ate food from vending machines, and did all they could to keep Kim from seeing their sadness, exhaustion, and frustration.\n\nAll around them, the Hills saw other parents doing exactly the same thing. They learned that many of the families had traveled great distances to bring their children to the medical facility; but the high cost of hotel rooms was prohibitive. They continued to think, “there has to be a happy medium.”\n\nHill rallied the support of his teammates to raise funds to help other families experiencing the same emotional and financial traumas as his own. Through the Philadelphia Eagles’ general manager, Jim Murray, the team offered its support to Dr. Audrey Evans, head of the pediatric oncology unit at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. It was Dr. Evans’ dream for a house that could serve as a temporary residence for families of children being treated at her hospital that led to the first Ronald McDonald House.\n\nThe Eagles enlisted the help of their McDonald’s restaurants to raise money for the first-ever House. In October 1974, the Philadelphia House opened bearing the name of Ronald McDonald.\n\nHow it grew!\n\nBy 1979, 10 more Ronald McDonald Houses had opened. In the next five years, local communities founded 60 more Houses; then 53 more opened in the next five years. Across the country and throughout the world, people viewed Ronald McDonald House as a way for a community to band together for their neighbors in need of comfort and security during a particularly difficult time.\n\nCurrently, there are 377 Ronald McDonald House programs in 45 countries and regions. All Houses have the same basic mission but vary in size, facility, and services. All are sustained through local donations and each House is independently owned and operated."
