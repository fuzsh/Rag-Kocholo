This letter includes the deadline for applications for grants.\n\nThe appropriate deans and chairs provide the Senior Vice Provost for Research with preliminary evaluations of applications for grants. The Senior Vice Provost combines these evaluations into a University recommendation. The final evaluation and award decision is made by the UDRF Research Committee. Grants are made primarily in the fields of the natural and physical sciences, but any proposal that uses scientific methods and promises quantitative results is eligible for a grant.\n\nGrants\n\nUDRF grants support high quality scientific and engineering projects by early-career, untenured, tenure-track faculty. Costs covered are stipends, graduate student or technical assistance, equipment, supplies, travel, etc. Grants are awarded on the basis of individual merit and specific need.\n\nThe awards are made in April and become effective on the following June 1.\n\nThese grants are not to be used for the support of advanced-degree theses nor for their publication.\n\nUnderstandings concerning the research grant programs and patents, copyright, and publishing considerations are stated in the Faculty Handbook and in this Policies and Procedures Manual.\n\nPatent, copyright, and publication policies are as stated in the University of Delaware Faculty Handbook and in sections 6-6 and 6-7 of this Policies and Procedures Manual."
