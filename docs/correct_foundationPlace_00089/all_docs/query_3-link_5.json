        "text": "Rodel’s mission is to strengthen Delaware’s public education system and workforce by connecting partners to advance and implement sustainable solutions.\n\nPublic education is a complex, interconnected system—one that ties into nearly every facet of\n\nDelaware society, from local economies to community health. That makes it vitally important\n\nfor a wide range of voices, research, and information to inform our decisions.\n\nThat’s where Rodel comes in. Like the humble bee, our team helps to cross-pollinate ideas\n\nfrom our neighborhoods, our local institutions, and experts from across the world—that may\n\nsomeday bloom and lead to successful outcomes for our children.\n\nLearn more about the work we do to convene cross-sector partners, connect good ideas to resources, scale, share and support ideas grounded in evidence and practice, and serve as a critical friend.\n\nWHAT WE DO\n\nRodel connects people, ideas, and resources to make those positive changes happen. We help donors and organizations—both public and private, as well as local and global—make informed decisions about how they can leverage philanthropic dollars for the greatest impact in our community.\n\nWe work side by side with educators and community leaders to make things happen from concept to execution. We strive for lasting, systemic, change, so our work depends on partnerships with broad and diverse collaborators."
