        "text": "The Next Gen South is a philanthropic organization that was created and is directed by young professionals living and working in Kent and Sussex Counties. Next Gen South utilizes many of the Delaware Community Foundation’s resources, but members have established their own structure to raise funds and support the community. Next Gen South’s charitable fund was organized in 2012 and awarded its first round of grants in 2013. Since its inception, Next Gen South has awarded more than $100,000 in support of initiatives that address underlying social challenges faced by the most vulnerable Delawareans in Kent and Sussex Counties. The focus of the organization changes periodically based on the needs of the communities they serve.\n\nNext Gen South is currently raising money to support programs for addiction treatment, family services, emergency housing, and homelessness prevention. The merits and execution of each program will determine grant selection.\n\nThe Delaware Community Foundation (DCF) is a nonprofit organization created in 1986 to provide a lasting source of charitable funding to benefit the people of Delaware by connecting people who care. The Foundation manages hundreds of charitable funds for individuals, families, businesses and organizations. It invests and administers these funds, then distributes the income as grants to many of the humanitarian, educational, health and cultural organizations in Delaware. The DCF also works with other nonprofit organizations to assess and meet community needs. The mission of the DCF is to inspire and help people of all backgrounds and means, in order to leave lasting legacies that benefit the people of Delaware.\n\nProposals for competitive grants are considered on the basis of how they address addiction and enhance the quality of life for Delawareans. Next Gen South is particularly interested in proactive, preventative and future-thinking proposals. Next Gen South’s Grants Committee oversees all grant decisions, subject to the approval of Next Gen South Board and the DCF Board of Directors. Only nonprofit organizations within the state of Delaware that have a 501(c)(3) designation by the Internal Revenue Service are eligible to apply. Agencies receiving Next Gen South grants must serve the state of Delaware and its residents without discrimination based on race, religion, gender, age, disability, national origin or sexual orientation.\n\nYou are required to distribute a press release announcing the grant and describing the project or program to be carried out with Next Gen South funding. By the middle of the grant year, recipients are required to provide a written summary of grant-related activities. At the end of the grant year, recipients are required to submit a written summary of grant-related activities and make an in-person presentation to the Board describing the completion and future of the supported program. Prior grant recipients may apply the following year if the grant focus has not changed based on the needs of the community.\n\nNext Gen South supports programs addressing addiction within our local community including, but not limited to, treatment services, addiction prevention and education, mental health services, and to support families who have experienced addiction. All applications that meet Next Gen South’s guidelines are thoroughly reviewed by the committee. Because Next Gen South receives more grant requests than it is able to support, nonprofit organizations are encouraged to seek funding from multiple sources for a particular program or project."
