        "text": "× 12/22: This website is no longer being updated. Thank you for your support over the past 25 years!\n\nArchived News Releases\n\nSingles Interaction, Inc.\n\nPosted August 19, 2020\n\nIf you are 21 years of age or better and single, divorced, widow or widower, Singles' Interaction invites you to join them on Friday nights. Come to the Eagles Lodge, 75 South 12th Street, Richmond (membership not required) and meet other single people in the Richmond area.\n\nCome, socialize, dance, and enjoy yourself!\n\nThree Entrepreneur Initiatives Named Award Finalists by UEDA\n\nPosted September 9, 2020\n\nIndiana University East has some big-time talent in its entrepreneur program.\n\nHow big? Two of its initiatives -- acronymed BOSS and CEOs -- have been named finalists in the Talent category of the 2020 University Economic Development Association (UEDA) Awards of Excellence.\n\nAnd a program called In Your Business Television is a finalist in the Talent and Place category.\n\n\"They only take 15 nominees and we got three,\" boasts Johnny Fike, who is one of three founders of the Cash Equals Opportunities (CEOs) program that has taught financial literacy to hundreds of high school students around the area. \"That's pretty big for our school here in Richmond, Indiana.\"\n\nEven \"bigger\" when considering that the competition includes a pair of finalists from the University of Kentucky and one finalist apiece from universities such as Indiana University Bloomington, South Carolina and Virginia Tech -- all that have enrollments of more than 30,000 students.\n\nIU East has about 3,500.\n\n\"We are very pleased with this recognition,\" says Denise S. Smith, dean of the IU East School of Business and Economics. \"Our entrepreneurship programs are having an impact on Richmond and on the entire IU East service region.\"\n\nThe Business Opportunities for Self Starters (BOSS) program is a finalist for the third straight competition. It's the first recognition for the CEOs program and for In Your Business Television.\n\nFinalists will present during the UEDA Digital Summit that is scheduled September 21-24 and winners will be announced September 30th. \"I am excited about each of them,\" says Tim Scales, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and the Center for Economic Education, and senior lecturer at IU East.\n\n\"We're on the big stage. This recognition is something truly special for IU East,\" Scales said.\n\nThe competition is special, too, he says: \"Everybody brings their 'A' game.\"\n\nThe awards recognize \"innovative programs across North America that focus on developing economic prosperity in their communities and beyond,\" according to the University Economic Development Association.\n\nScales originally developed BOSS as a two-year program -- and it's still growing and evolving after 13 years.\n\nIn Your Business Television features even more longevity: Scales has hosted the program for 16 years and recorded more than 400 episodes. \"I never dreamed of having a show, much less running this long,\" he admits.\n\nTim Scales, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and the Center for Economic Education and senior lecturer, interviews a guest on In Your Business Television. The show is a finalist for UEDA's Talent & Place category.\n\nEach 30-minute program features an interview with a local business leader who offers a peek into their companies and how they have succeeded. \"I really get to know them and their businesses,\" Scales said.\n\nThe shows are taped through Whitewater Community Television (WCTV), located on the IU East campus, with the help of Executive Director Eric Marsh, Ryan Harris, videographer/director, and other staff members.\n\nThe Talent and Place category exemplifies how putting the right people in the right environment will benefit the community and economy, according to the UEDA.\n\nBOSS continues to take its upbeat message of entrepreneurship to new levels -- and new places -- by teaching more instructors and program leaders. For example, Scales helped seed a program at the Kelly School of Business at IUPUI and also led a summer camp at George Washington High School. He has even taken the program to give presentations in countries around the world.\n\n\"The BOSS program is a signature program at IU East and one of the significant ways that we can have an impact on local schools,\" Smith said.\n\nScales envisions a BOSS program in the near future where students will develop the complete program and even get paid for their efforts. He also envisions one with a much bigger online presence.\n\n\"Tim Scales has done amazing work with all of our entrepreneurship programs and has had a positive impact on our students,\" Smith says. \"The nominations highlight the impressive contributions of IU East, Tim Scales, and our students in entrepreneurship.\"\n\nThe three current leaders of the Cash Equals Opportunities program were attracted to IU East by the entrepreneurship program -- and also by Red Wolves' athletics.\n\n(From left to right) JoÃ£o Vitor de Lima, Johnny Fike and Cole Fosbrink are finalists for UEDA's Talent category.\n\nThey are: Fike of Bradford, Ohio, JoÃ£o Vitor de Lima of Curitiba, Brazil, and Cole Fosbrink of Seymour, Indiana.\n\nJoe Griffin, director of athletics, said, \"Johnny, JoÃ£o and Cole are shining examples of championship-caliber efforts our IU East student-athletes put forth in all competitions - both academic and athletic. We are very excited to see they are among such a select group of nominees for a national award. I'm very proud of our athletes being named as finalists. This is a great representation of some of the great student-athletes that we have on our teams and how they are succeeding in their academics.\"\n\nFosbrink and de Lima play together as defenders on the men's soccer team. \"I am left back and he's right back,\" Fosbrink said. \"We make each other better.\"\n\nFike runs for the cross country and track teams -- and is a double major with one academic area outside of business. The junior is a criminal justice major who aims to become a police chief someday.\n\nHe and de Lima co-founded the CEOs program -- along with 2019 alumna Paige Gray -- as part of Money Smart Day, an annual public-education personal-finance program started by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. It became quickly obvious that the IU East program would work well on a long-term basis.\n\nThe trio gave a presentation to 150 students on the IU East campus in spring 2019. \"That was pretty cool,\" says de Lima, who is a junior with a major in business administration. \"It's great for the students and it's awesome to work and learn with them.\"\n\nFosbrink, a junior finance major, stepped in to replace Gray last year and already has brought new ideas that are used with CEOs.\n\nThe students are excited to be finalists.The Talent category focuses on programs that teach people how to thrive in the 21st century Knowledge Economy. This includes life-long learning, experiential education and discovery-based learning programs, active alignment of curricula to industry needs, and more.\n\n\"I didn't know what to think at first. We were all eager and waiting. We are super happy,\" Fosbrink said. \"All the late nights, the traveling and presenting were worth it. We hope to continue doing this and go to a lot more places.\"\n\nDe Lima agrees. \"It was a good experience and something I didn't expect. It's an honor enough to be nominated. It would be even a greater honor to win,\" he said.\n\nAnd Fike: \"We didn't know where we were, where we'd place. We were ecstatic, couldn't believe it.\"\n\nScales and the students plan to present for the awards show online, but de Lima will probably have to do so from Brazil. He's unable to fly back to the United States this semester because of a travel ban in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe students all laud the close-knit atmosphere at IU East. \"Every person I met at first treated me like we'd known each other for years,\" Fike said. \"We are one big family there. That's what is so awesome about IU East.\"\n\nAnd de Lima: \"The great thing about IU East is making close contacts. You can have relationships with instructors, which allows you to better develop yourself during your academic career. It's a great experience.\"\n\nFosbrink admits he didn't know anything about IU East until getting a text from the Red Wolves soccer coach late in his senior year of high school.\n\nHe was intrigued, but still planning to attend a college nearer his home, until a chance meeting with Scales during his recruiting visit. \"He's the one that made me feel like this is the place I wanted to go,\" Fosbrink said. \"I am loving it here.\"\n\nThe three students each lead a section of the CEOs demonstration that they present to high school students.\n\n\"I talk about savings accounts,\" Fosbrink said. \"Joao talks about checking accounts and Johnny talks about the CEO Method of saving.\"\n\nThat method is the centerpiece of the program. Its main concept is that consumers should save double the amount of money they need to buy consumer goods such as bikes, computer games, headphones or musical equipment.\n\n\"If you want to buy something for $50, you have to make $100. That's the message we created to start the implementation of the saving mentality on those high school students,\" de Lima explains.\n\nScales explains further. \"You will get things you want, but still always have money saved. Otherwise, you aren't saving; you are just spending,\" he said.\n\nThe trio often trade ideas about improving the program while they drive around the area to give their presentations. They also meet with Scales to brainstorm new ideas.\n\n\"He leaves it to us. He sits there and listens to us three,\" Fosbrink said. \"Sometimes he'll jump in and guide us when necessary.\"\n\nFosbrink promises the program will grow.\n\n\"We are just getting started. There is more to come. We'll come up with more ideas and get a lot bigger,\" Fosbrink said.\n\nIU East's Adulting 101 Goes Virtual, First Event Is September 16\n\nPosted September 9, 2020\n\nThis fall's version of Adulting 101 can't be in person because of the pandemic.\n\nSo, free food is out â and free online nourishment is in.\n\nThe series still will offer a bounty of intellectual servings starting September 16 on Zoom. The popular video and Web conferencing platform is increasingly being used for classes, conferences and business meetings.\n\nAdulting 101 is sponsored by First Bank Richmond.\n\n\"It's life-enriching classes, done virtually,\" explains Terry Wiesehan, director of Alumni Relations at Indiana University East.\n\nThe four-session series will explore common themes during uncommon times, where staying healthy and staying home have become the new normal.\n\nIn fact, Adulting 101 starts with a presentation that is titled Surviving 2020: How to Stay Physically and Mentally Healthy.\n\n\"We thought that was very appropriate for now,\" Wiesehan says, \"I want the audience to gain knowledge that is relevant in their lives â¦ that intersects with their lives during the pandemic.\"\n\nStephanie Andel, an assistant professor of psychology at IUPUI, will be the featured speaker and will take part in a question-and-answer session after the initial program.\n\nThe fall series is a collaboration of the IU Alumni Association East Region and the Wayne County Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe other monthly presentations will address topics such as spending, networking and balancing work and life.\n\nEach program was selected with the right timing in mind, Wiesehan says. For example, the second one â on October 21 â is geared toward the upcoming holiday spending season: It's titled Big Spender: Building Credit and Making Big Purchases.\n\nThe rest of the schedule is:\n\nNovember 18: Networking, Mingling and Small Talkâ¦OH MY!\n\nDecember 16: Free Time? What's That?: Tips and Tricks for Balancing Work and Life.\n\nEach session will be held virtually via Zoom. After registering, participants will receive a confirmation email that contains the link to the session. To register, visit Eventbrite.\n\n\"We know how crazy this time is,\" Wiesehan says, noting that many more alumni, students and their families are doing work from their homes in efforts to stave off COVID-19. \"We are learning to work with distractions, multitasking in different ways. Life balance is even more crucial.\"\n\nThe names of other guest speakers and registration details will be announced soon.\n\nRoxie Deer will help promote the programs and will represent the chamber and its HYPE initiative (Helping Young Professionals Engage). She is director of Programs and Events for the Wayne County Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nHYPE is aimed at helping those ages 21 to 40 to engage in the community by offering social and professional development opportunities, according to the chamber's website.\n\n\"HYPE does a lot of great work to support our young professionals,\" Wiesehan says. \"That includes so many of our young alumni and this another way to connect with their alma mater.\" However, Wiesehan was quick to mention that the program is open to anyone as a community outreach.\n\nAdulting 101 was first launched in the fall of 2018 by Oi Lin Cheung, associate professor of finance and director of the Center for Business and Economic Research for the School of Business and Economics. Cheung secured a Sustaining Talent-Engaging Partners (STEP) grant through the \"Building a Bright Future\" project and partnered with the Office of External Affairs to organize monthly events to help young professionals build a bright financial future.\n\nAn Evening of Broadway\n\nPosted September 22, 2020\n\nAndrew Triana presents An Evening of Broadway, a special FREE event.

And the newest officers are the first of existing staff who have not served as officers in previous jobs. \"This is exciting for our growth,\" Kolentus said. The four this week - Brian Bolin, Mike Hurst, Ryan Gerber and Brian Jackson - are now official officers as they prepare to go for eight weeks of Academy training.\n\nFrom left: Sgt. Brian Jackson, Officer Mike Hurst, Officer Ryan Gerber and Sgt. Brian Bolin.\n\nThey join the original four sworn-in officers that included Kolentus, Assistant Chief Jeff Cappa, Captain Dennis Perkins and Steve Smith; and Jeff Glover was sworn-in in early March.\n\nThe health system joined others in the state to transform its department and security team to a police department as a way to enhance the security and safety of Reid Health patients, visitors, staff and the community members who use Reid services.\n\nThe change reflects the growth of Reid Health and the accompanying increase in the need for police assistance, Kolentus said. When the move to establish the department was announced in early 2020, he noted that the Richmond Police Department responded to Reid calls almost 900 times in 2019.\n\nBecoming a police force means increased training and certifications for the 23-member security team in Richmond and Connersville. It also provides officers arrest authority, allows them to deal more effectively with an increasing number of potentially violent incidents, and creates what will ultimately be the third largest police force in the county, behind the Richmond Police Department and Wayne County Sheriff's Department.\n\nKolentus noted violence against physicians and other care providers has increased in recent years, including some where employees were injured while providing patient care. With police officers on site, the health system has more flexibility in dealing with issues including the option to arrest.\n\nThe former Security Department has grown from nine officers in 2016 to more than twice that today, also a reflection of the Reid Health system's growth geographically and in number of team members to about 3,400. Kolentus noted that the main campus in Richmond typically has more people at any given time than some of the area's small towns.\n\n\"We are taking all the steps necessary to protect our patients, their families and our team members,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Ehlers, Reid Health Vice President/Chief Quality Officer, said the growing force reflects Reid Health's commitment to patient and staff safety in all aspects. \"This change was the right move at the right time. We can never let up on our efforts to make and keep all our facilities as safe as possible for the thousands of people we serve each day.\"\n\nA Second Round of Small Businesses Get Relief\n\nPosted September 3, 2020\n\nIn June, Center City Development Corporation in partnership with the City of Richmond, announced that eight Main Street District businesses had received relief from the first round of grants awarded through funds made possible by the Office of Community and Rural Affairs (OCRA). This grant program offered by OCRA was developed to help retain jobs by providing operational capital and support for remote work.\n\nOCRA was able to provide this opportunity by redirecting their Community Development Block Grant funds to assist with COVID-19. This redirect of funds was in response to Governor Holcomb's Executive Order 20-05, which called for additional actions to protect and support Hoosiers across the state.\n\nCenter City Development Corporation in partnership with the City of Richmond is pleased to announce that they have continued their efforts to support local businesses through this pandemic with fourteen additional Main Street District businesses being awarded grants through this initiative. This second round of grant awards totaled $126,500. Of those businesses, 85% were microenterprises who recently had been ineligible for most programs. This round of grants also showed strong support for minority, women and veteran-owned businesses with over 90% of the recipients falling into one of these categories.\n\n\"This round of grant recipients included several businesses who had been ineligible for many of the programs offered for relief from the impact of COVID-19. Many of these businesses were reaching the point of exhausted reserve and their most uncertainty through this pandemic. It was an honor to be able to help these businesses finally receive the gift of hope that they all so greatly deserve. It is the goal of Center City Development Corporation to ensure that local businesses always know that they have someone they can count on to help them through all facets of their business journey.\" said Beth Newton, Executive Director of Center City Development Corporation.\n\nCenter City Development Corporation strives to enrich Richmond's downtown by coordinating and collaborating with city government, property owners, and business owners to create economic prosperity, community development and a vibrant center city.

We made this decision based upon safety concerns during this time of COVID-19. The Smart Futures Dinner is the premier event for the Club and has been honoring individuals since 2003 who through hard work and dedication, can create a positive future for themselves. Smart Futures Co-Chairs Kelly VanVleet and Jera Schwer said, \"Our Committee worked hard all year long to put together a first class event and while we tried to work within all the social distancing guidelines and safety protocols, we feel that it is better to cancel the 2020 event and postpone honoring Mr. Warfield until 2021.\"\n\nThe Club was honoring Jack Warfield, a Richmond native and 42-year veteran of the golf industry, who worked as a PGA TOUR executive for 21 years, the last eight as PGA TOUR LatinoamÃ©rica President, who retired at the end of 2019.\n\nWarfield stated \"I was really looking forward to getting back to Richmond but applauded the wise decision of the Club. I look forward to next year's event and hope that the community realizes that the Club continues to provide programs and services daily and needs the community support.\" Warfield will be honored at the event planned for the fall of 2021.\n\nTim Frame, Regional President at 3-Rivers Federal Credit Union who had generously agreed to be the Title Sponsor of the dinner and stated, \"We were very excited to be the Title Sponsor of the Smart Futures Dinner but think during these unprecedented and unsure times that the Boys & Girls Clubs continues to do whatever it takes for the safety of our community and kids. 3-Rivers believes in the life-changing and ongoing programs at the Boys & Girls Club and support the needs of the youth in our community and we look forward to our continued support of their efforts.\"\n\nThe \"Doing Whatever It Takes: The Campaign for Kids\" will kick-off during the month of October and help to raise funds to replace lost income from the Smart Futures Dinner, other special events and annual campaign income that has been lost during the year due to COVID-19 related cancelations. The Boys & Girls Clubs of Wayne County continue to serve youth on a daily basis and provide programing for kids during the after school hours at 4 locations throughout Wayne County.

The new program will begin by serving senior citizens in Centerville who receive home-delivered meals through LifeStream Services.\n\nThe Gleaners, Gateway Hunger Relief Center and LifeStream partnership will provide supplemental fresh food and pantry items to homebound seniors two times per month. Volunteer meal delivery drivers will act as proxy shoppers and will deliver additional food supplies to seniors who might otherwise not have access to fresh foods.\n\n\"During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that those we serve are at higher risk for the virus,\" said John Elliott, President/CEO of Gleaners. \"Senior citizens in particular, have been strongly advised to stay home as much as possible. We also know that good nutrition improves health and builds immunity. This partnership with LifeStream is precisely the kind of collaborative program that will make a true impact on reducing the meal gap.\"\n\nThe COVID pandemic has highlighted the need to partner with other community organizations to meet the needs of older adults and people with disabilities,\" said Jenny Hamilton, President/CEO of LifeStream. \"LifeStream has a long history of partnering with community organizations and has been able to expand those partnerships and build new ones to help meet the new challenges the pandemic brings. We appreciate Gleaners and their willingness to collaborate to help meet the needs of this population.\"\n\nNutrition is vital to maintaining a healthy quality of life. LifeStream is committed to partnering with organizations and enhancing the nutrition program to meet the dire need of nutrition among seniors. Gleaners and LifeStream hope to expand its partnership in additional locations to serve seniors within the next few months.

Also receive a complimentaryÂ bookÂ \"Honor Eternal: Wayne County Men in the Civil War,\" written by MRL Reference Librarian Steve Martin and local history enthusiasts Duane and Angie Reed.\n\nThe free book and activity offer an opportunity for those in Wayne County to get out and independently explore local history even during the pandemic. Thanks to a grant from Wayne County Foundation, the county's residents may pick up a free copy of a local Civil War history book and an optional scavenger hunt in the style of a bingo board. Participants get to keep the book and materials all at no charge.\n\nHistory enthusiasts are encouraged to stop by any Wayne County library during business hours to pick up a book and scavenger hunt printout. The Scavenger Hunt is self-paced. Those who don't yet feel comfortable entering libraries may benefit from curbside pickup of the books. They may be picked up through each library's curbside service after making prior arrangements.\n\nThe scavenger hunt features 16 sites in Richmond, Cambridge City, Centerville, East Germantown and Fountain City that have a connection to the Civil War, such as murals, historical markers along roads and in cemeteries, museums, churches and private homes to drive by and admire from a distance. The back side of the bingo sheet features a few details gathered by Martin about several sites featured on the scavenger hunt. The project is an effort by Friends of Morrisson-Reeves Library and Cambridge City Main Street to spotlight the county's Civil War history and encourage exploration of sites and communities that participants might not have previously visited.\n\nParticipants will receive a complimentary copy of \"Honor Eternal: Wayne County Men in the Civil War.\" The 172-page book describes local soldiers'; experiences in battle from diaries and newspapers and includes detailed histories of local regiments. It also features many photographs and a directory listing each local soldier, likely the last time that many of their names will be in print. Wayne County sacrificed in many ways to support the war effort. Six regiments trained locally, and about 4,425 soldiers from Wayne County joined when there were only 29,558 residents in the county.\n\nSteve Martin said a third to half of the county's adult males left to fight in the Civil War, and about 11 percent did not return alive.\n\nCURRENT LIBRARY HOURS\n\nMorrisson-Reeves Library, 80 N.

He also leads a meeting twice a week with all regional health department officials where the data is reviewed and participants can share details about what's going on in their communities and in their schools.\n\n\"The COVID-19 risk seems to be low for healthy people under 40, including children - but of course there are exceptions. Generally it's around the same percentage as seasonal influenza,\" he said. Though since the outbreak hit the area, only one teen has been hospitalized at Reid Health -- and the teen improved quickly -- Dr. Huth notes an increased risk for some ethnic groups that still make following the guidelines imperative for everyone.\n\nHe says the information he monitors daily from national and international organizations indicates increased risk for Latino and African-American children, children with lung conditions, obesity or a history of premature birth.\n\nThe efforts to prevent the spread seem more challenging at the college level, he says. \"What I hear from health departments is that the plans for protection on college campuses are good. The problem is a sometimes lack of discipline of some students outside of the classroom, particularly off campus at bars and parties.\"\n\nDr. Huth encourages parents to set the example for their children and teens by using masks properly, washing their hands frequently and practicing distancing - even in family gatherings. Some clusters of outbreaks in the region have followed family gatherings where the safety guidelines were not followed, he notes.\n\nYounger children are also now believed to be less likely to be asymptomatic spreaders - people who show no symptoms but are still contagious to at-risk adults. \"Generally, the younger the child, the less likely. After age 10 though, it increases to the same likelihood of high schoolers and college age kids, who probably transmit it as readily as adults. But in no age group can we say there is not risk of transmission, so at all ages preventative measures must be taken.\"\n\nThe measures are especially important for Latino and African-American children, who seem to be at somewhat higher risk - especially those with other chronic conditions. \"Though the risk is still relatively low, parents and children of all backgrounds must not let up with safety measures until COVID-19 is no longer a threat.\"\n\nDr. Huth said regional school systems are all taking many steps to keep kids safe and working with their local health departments on any needs to isolate and quarantine when an infection is found.\n\n\"If everyone continues to follow the guidelines carefully, we believe this will help us avoid an upswing in COVID-19 cases.\"\n\nMore information: https://www.reidhealth.org/safe\n\nNatco Credit Union Forgives $18,737 in Interest on Member Loans\n\nPosted August 20, 2020\n\nThrough their Deferred Payment Relief for Service Industry Workers initiative, Natco Credit Union was able to forgive $18,737 on 50 loans held by members who were hardest hit by the pandemic due to loss of income.\n\nNatco received a $10,000 grant from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to assist members who suffered a financial impact from a loss of employment due to COVID-19. The credit union forgave an additional $8,737 in an effort to help more members.\n\nBelow is an example of a member who was helped by the Deferred Payment Relief for Service Industry Workers initiative.\n\nThis member was laid off in March when his employer closed due to COVID. A 90-day payment deferral on his credit union loans was immediately granted. Not long after losing his income, he contracted COVID-19 and came very close to losing his battle with the virus. He was placed on a ventilator, then suffered a stroke, and lapsed into a coma.\n\nAfter a lengthy stay in the hospital, he recovered enough to be released but was unable to care for himself. He temporarily moved in with a relative, where he received visiting nursing services and was required to wear a heart monitor. Almost four months later, he still had lingering symptoms that may never go away. He was eventually able to return to work with the added burden of a mountain of medical bills.\n\nDuring his time off, interest accumulated on two credit union loans in the amount of $1,691.56. Through this initiative, Natco was able to forgive the entire amount of accumulated interest. The member was moved to tears and said that no one had ever done something that nice for him in his entire life.\n\nNatco's mission statement is 'Helping people live better lives.' This initiative has helped numerous members in a challenging time and is an example of how Natco lives up to their mission.\n\nNatco Credit Union is a community-chartered credit union with three offices â two located in Richmond (582 S. Round Barn Road and 4 Glen Miller Parkway) and one located in Connersville (240 E. 30th Street) and the Natco Community Empowerment Center located in Richmond (1627 E. Main Street).\n\nParkinson's Programs Aim to Improve Issues with Speech\n\nPosted August 19, 2020\n\nTwo new therapy programs at Reid Rehabilitation Services are designed to help Parkinson's patients improve one of the effects of the disease - a weakened voice.\n\n\"These two related programs help patients increase their overall vocal quality and intensity, and they can maintain this improvement for years after completing the program,\" said Kari Parks, Speech Therapist who helped get the program launched.\n\nThrough the process of investigating options to replace a previous program, she discovered a grant application for the Parkinson's Voice Project, which combines education and individual speech therapy with SPEAK OUT!Â® and group therapy called The LOUD CrowdÂ®.\n\nSPEAK OUT! consists of 12 individual sessions with a speech therapist to learn training and exercises, with a weekly group session, The LOUD Crowd, for support and maintenance.\n\n\"There is a clear need,\" she said, noting that Reid Health already provides other services such as Rock Steady Boxing - Reid Health to up to 100 Parkinson's patients. The program also helps connect patients with others who are dealing with similar challenges.\n\nThe SPEAK OUT! individual sessions are billed through insurance programs and the group session is free, she said. SPEAK OUT! requires physician referral.\n\nFor more information on the programs, contact Reid Rehab Services at (765) 983-3092 or visit Parkinson's Voice Project.\n\nZoom Meeting Scheduled for Indiana's Rapid Recovery Initiative\n\nPosted August 19, 2020\n\nAbout:\n\nIndiana's Rapid Recovery Initiative is helping individuals, communities, and businesses get back to work.

The presentation will also be broadcast on Zoom; to register in advance, please go to https://richmondindiana-gov.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_HReZdD89QIeRANRXI1jFeA [richmondindiana-gov.zoom.us]. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom presentation.\n\nThe purpose of the public meeting is to offer all interested persons an opportunity to comment on preliminary plans for the proposed bridge replacement project on US 27 over Norfolk Southern Railroad (NSRR) and local streets in the City of Richmond, Wayne County, Indiana. US 27 serves as a main north-south route for the downtown Richmond area. The existing bridge is approximately 0.3 mile north of westbound US 40. In addition to crossing NSRR, the US 27 bridge crosses five local streets. Of those five, North E Street and Fort Wayne Avenue are both major collectors; two are local roads, Elm Place and North F Street; and the fifth is an alley completely covered by the existing bridge that connects Elm Place and North E Street.\n\nThe needs for this project are due to the deteriorated condition of the current structure, INDOT Structure No. 027-89-02136 B, and pedestrian facilities on the bridge that do not meet current standards. The existing 17-span noncontinuous bridge layout places unprotected piers in the middle of busy streets, and there are areas of collision damage. The pedestrian facilities on the bridge are substandard and do not meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. Additionally, there are existing concrete staircases on all four quadrants of the bridge that are substandard and deteriorating.\n\nThe proposed project would replace the existing structure with an 8-span bridge on the same alignment, with minimal anticipated grade change. The segment of North F Street located at the north bridge abutment would be permanently closed to traffic and filled. The existing sidewalks on the bridge would be replaced with an ADA-compliant pedestrian facility on the west side of the bridge. The eastern sidewalk and staircases would be removed, while the western staircase would remain. Guardrail would be replaced as-needed. Less than 0.5 acre of right-of-way acquisition is anticipated. During construction, US 27 would be closed to traffic and a detour would be provided. Construction is planned for 2023 and work would occur year-round.\n\nThis public open house will follow Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) guidance, health and safety protocols including project team members wearing face masks and/or coverings, providing hand sanitizer, and access to hand washing facilities, and implementing social distancing, including monitoring the number of attendees participating to comply with local regulations. Public information meeting attendees are required to wear masks and practice social distancing. Attendees who do not have a mask will be provided one, and hand sanitation stations will be available. Due to the pandemic, in-person meeting time and location is subject to change.\n\nWith advance notice, the Project Team can provide special accommodation for persons with disabilities and/or limited English speaking ability and persons needing auxiliary aids or services such as interpreters, signers, readers, or large print. Should special accommodation be needed please contact Alex Lee, Parsons at (317) 616-1011, or email alexander.lee@parsons.com or contact me at (317) 467-3986 or e-mail nriggs@indot.in.gov.\n\nNathan Riggs\n\nProject Manager\n\nIndiana Department of Transportation\n\nThe Show Must Go On!\n\nPosted August 19, 2020\n\nVirtual Concert Experience for MRL's Annual Musically Spectacular Event!\n\nChanticleer String Quartet\n\nwith guest artist William F.

Annual and regional training opportunities have created opportunities for Indiana members to learn from and see how needs are met in other areas of the country which may benefit them.\"\n\nJennifer Ehlers, Vice President/Chief Quality Officer, said Kolentus has been instrumental in the growth and expansion of the Indiana chapter. \"His leadership has not only had a positive impact on Reid's officers, but all officers serving healthcare entities throughout the state. We are proud and thankful for his dedicated service.\"\n\nThough not a direct goal of the international organization, the chapter has been involved in state legislation making it possible for hospitals and health systems to form police departments to better handle security issues - something Reid Health did early this year.\n\nKolentus said the group is also working to develop a police academy training curriculum more specific to the needs of healthcare police officers.\n\n2nd Annual JOY Games Set for September\n\nPosted August 3, 2020\n\nFeaturing three fun-fill days of games for older adults.\n\nLifeStream Services, Reid Health Alliance Medicare, The Leland Legacy, and Richmond Senior Community Center are bringing back JOY (Just Older Youth) Games for the second year.

One change for the positive is bringing rave reviews from providers and patients - the expansion of telehealth.\n\n\"I've discovered my patients have been pleasantly surprised at just how easy telehealth can be,\" says Jason Casselman, D.O., Reid Allergy. \"With only a click of a link, they can be connected to a video visit with me. I have a feeling many will want to continue using telehealth.\"\n\nPatient reviews of the service back that up. \"I love the telehealth option. Everything was handled promptly and professionally,\" said one. Others said they appreciated being able to avoid coming into an office during the pandemic. \"It was a positive experience technically and medically. I am grateful for the telehealth option during the coronavirus pandemic.\"\n\nBefore COVID-19, Reid Health telehealth was available for urgent care visits only through the Reid HealthNOW application. When the federal Department of Health & Human Services lifted restrictions on rules for providing and covering telehealth because of COVID-19, patients were able to have visits for primary and specialty care to avoid going out in public and therefore reduce the risk of COVID.\n\nThe visits also can help:\n\nOvercome transportation obstacles for patients who don't drive\n\nKeep patients from having to drive in inclement weather\n\nEliminate travel time to and from appointments\n\nReduce the need for cancelling appointments when unexpected issues arise - for example, a parent with an appointment who needs to stay home with a child would be able to avoid rescheduling their visit.\n\nNot only did patients like being able to stay home and still receive care, many physicians who had not used telehealth before also found it a great tool for seeing patients.\n\n\"People bank virtually, shop virtually, socialize virtually, attend church virtually and go to school virtually. As such, having a virtual telehealth visit isn't as nearly foreign for patients as it is sometimes for providers.\" -- Jordan Raynor, M.D., neurology\n\nJordan Raynor, M.D., neurology, was quite familiar with telehealth from previous experience. \"Studies have shown telehealth to have clinical merit in many areas of neurology, so I was willing to be an early adaptor.\" He says his patients really like the option, though \"obviously it works better for some patients than others.\"\n\nSome of his patients with limited mobility appreciate not having to come to his office for appointments. \"Be it stroke, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, sometimes getting out of the house for a doctor's appointment is the hardest part of the visit.\" Dr. Raynor says almost all patients can use telehealth at least some of the time, including high acuity patients.\n\nTelehealth allows easier access to services, improves outreach and can also lower the cost of care. \"While the current telehealth changes are temporary, Health & Human Services appears to have recognized the public's positive response to telehealth. Medicare is reviewing telehealth use data to decide if the flexibilities should be extended, so hopefully we see these changes become permanent.\"\n\nTelehealth has especially high patient satisfaction numbers because of the convenience it offers, said Randi Whitesel, Director of Telehealth/Occupational Medicine for Reid Health. She believes the success of the service during the pandemic increases the chances the expansion will become more permanent.\n\nAnother option introduced during the pandemic is a remote patient monitoring option that is an app that patients can download on their smart phone. The app reminds patients to check their temperature and asks questions about any symptoms. The information is monitored by staff during the hours of the Respiratory Clinic, creating a great way to track the health of patients who may be sick but not requiring hospitalization.\n\nLacie Burge, NP, says most of her patients were eager to try telehealth for visits because of the pandemic. \"My patients have enjoyed having the option of seeing their provider amidst a busy work day, instead of taking a vacation day or half day. Now they can see me on their morning break or lunch. For this reason, I believe this has helped to increase patient compliance.\"\n\nShe says younger patients are generally more receptive, but has found the older population who were more at risk with COVID-19 like such visits when appropriate.\n\nAndrew Deitsch, M.D., says he and most of his patients prefer in-person visits, though some appreciated the option because of the pandemic. \"There is just something important to being in a room with someone and having the opportunity to lay on hands if needed. Personal and full care is difficult through a computer screen.\"\n\nTelehealth provided him some insight, however, not available in office visits, he said. \"It was helpful for me to see the setup of the home of a patient who was having mobility issues.\"\n\nDr. Raynor expects telehealth will become a tool in the overall care process, with patients having a mix of in-person and online appointments. He also believes patients may sometimes be more receptive than providers accustomed to seeing patients in person.\n\nProtocols Announced for Area Arts Organizations\n\nPosted August 3, 2020\n\nAfter a thorough review of guidelines set forth by Center for Disease Control and a consultation with Wayne County Health Department, a collective of Richmond arts organizations, including DIVA, Richmond Art Museum, Richmond Civic Theatre, Richmond Community Orchestra, Richmond Shakespeare Festival, Richmond Symphony Orchestra and Starr Gennett Foundation have agreed on protocols for offering live performances and events into late summer and throughout the fall.\n\nAs we face many of the same concerns around opening our doors and the significant cross-over in audience members, it is only natural that we work together to present consistent plans for fall programming and the continuance of live performances, demonstrations and events. Due to the fluidity of the situation, our plans and procedures may change, but we believe in the importance of collaborative efforts during these uncertain times.\n\nLooking to late summer and into the fall, we are re-envisioning activities that prioritize the safety and protection of staff, artists, volunteers and patrons. Protocols include enhanced cleaning, staff training in COVID safety procedures, required masking and social distancing of those on site at events, and reservations to monitor attendance, comply with reduced maximum occupancy limits and facilitate contact tracing.\n\nOur organizations hope to return this fall with programming in line with anticipated restrictions, including but not limited to: revised schedules with the possibility of fewer rearranged or rescheduled events and performances, a reduced number of artist participants, and a lowered number in attendance to ensure proper social distancing.\n\nWhile this situation remains fluid and creates uncertainty, we must work to finalize viable plans to ensure the fulfillment of our missions in creating cultural experiences that benefit the community.\n\nMRL and Libraries Worldwide Investigate Conspiracies in Largest Digital Book Club\n\nPosted July 30, 2020\n\nRousing page-turner \"The Darwin Affair\" ebook now available for reading and discussion with global audience\n\nMorrisson-Reeves Library patrons are joining millions of others around the globe in reading a historical fiction thriller ebook and audiobook during Big Library Read, the world's largest digital book club.

Though most cloth and other types of masks are OK, masks with exhalation valves allow unfiltered air to be exhaled, increasing the chance of exposing others to the virus.\n\n\"In general, masks are effective because they help prevent the likelihood of someone breathing out the virus, as well as reduce the risk of someone inhaling contaminated air,\" Ehlers said.\n\nAcceptable masks include homemade cloth masks, surgical or procedural masks, dust masks and N-95 masks that are not vented.\n\nReid Health door screeners at all locations, besides checking for other potential symptoms, will also not allow anyone to enter a Reid facility wearing a vented mask. The screeners will provide an approved mask in those cases.\n\nEhlers noted that the trend in positive cases and hospitalizations with positive or presumed positive COVID has been going up again at Reid Health. As of Thursday, the number was back to 34 hospitalized after hitting a low in the teens in early July.\n\n\"This means we cannot let down our guard - COVID-19 is still very much a reality in our area, so mask up!\"\n\nVisit ReidHealth.org/Safe for a downloadable copy of this flyer.\n\nReid Health in Connersville One Year Later: Progress, More to Come\n\nPosted July 28, 2020\n\nA year after Reid Health assumed ownership of the assets of the former Fayette Regional Health System, improvements have been made to many of the facilities and sustainable services have been maintained or even expanded.\n\n\"We hear constantly from patients and their loved ones that they are so glad that Reid is in the community,\" said Brandon Glover, who as manager of the Reid Health - Connersville Emergency Department has witnessed many improvements firsthand. From new stretchers, and cardiac monitors, computers and an updated medical record system, Reid Health continues to invest in the emergency department and all its other facilities in the Connersville community. More EMS personnel and board-certified ER physicians have also been added. And a process to seek accreditation as a Stroke Ready emergency facility is under way.\n\n\"We made it clear a year ago that we were committed to keeping sustainable services available for our patients and families in the Connersville area,\" said Craig Kinyon, Reid Health President/CEO. \"We are pleased at the progress we have made in this first year. From high quality emergency care to medical practices, urgent care, radiology services and access to specialists, we continue to evaluate and invest in services for the Connersville area.\"\n\nAngie Dickman, Reid Health Vice President, said stabilizing and improving emergency care in Connersville was one of the most significant and vital priorities. \"We also stabilized outpatient services.\" The emergency department began with an average of 300 patients a month and the temporary use of paper records to an average today of 900 who now benefit from Epic, one of the top electronic record systems.\n\nRandy Kirk, Vice President/Reid Health Foundation President, also noted the Fayette Regional Health System Foundation board's decision to dissolve and transfer its remaining assets to Reid Health Foundation. \"We are pleased and humbled by the trust this represents in our organization and our commitment to continue to invest in philanthropic support in our Connersville facilities.\"\n\nWhen 1941 Virginia Avenue became Reid Health - Connersville, and other locations became Reid Health Care Pavilion, Reid HealthWorks and Primary & Specialty Care - Virginia Avenue there were approximately 280 employees at these facilities. Today, there are 312, with approximately 440 Reid Health system team members living in Connersville and Fayette County overall.\n\nThe many upgrades and improvements for the Emergency Department include:\n\nHiring five permanent Emergency Medicine Board-Certified physicians\n\nCompletely re-equipping the department with new stretchers, cardiac monitors, defibrillators, ultrasound machines and other equipment\n\nAddition of RN case managers to assist with patient needs\n\nMajor upgrade from initial paper charting to the Epic medical record system\n\nElsewhere, other improvements, changes and offerings in the past year include:\n\nRecruiting Christi Holmes, M.D., pediatrician, a Connersville native who is seeing patients at Whitewater Valley Primary Care; and Jordan Parrett, M.D., emergency physician and Connersville native, who will be seeing patients in the Connersville ED this fall\n\nRestoring outpatient lab and radiology services\n\nSubstantial investment to improve the information services technology in Connersville locations\n\nPurchasing a new vehicle for Reid Health Police Department in Connersville and providing officers more equipment, training and support\n\nContinued support and investment by Reid Health Community Benefit with grants and funding support for programs including launching the new Wellness Wednesdays event held the first Wednesday of each month at the Fayette Senior Center; providing more than $57,000 in grants to community organizations in 2019, bringing the five-year total for the county to more than $322,000; hosting the Reid Healthier Community Day last August, attended by about 600 community members; distributing 40 cases of water during the 2019 summer heat advisory; and donating hats, gloves and scarves to elementary schools\n\nRestoring cardiopulmonary rehabilitation services\n\nContinuing outpatient physical therapy and restoring occupational therapy\n\nImprovements to the existing cafeteria, renamed Conners Post CafÃ© at 1941 Virginia Ave.\n\nMaintaining inpatient and residential adolescent behavioral health at the Care Pavilion, which was also provided two new vehicles and has had some preliminary remodeling with more under way or scheduled in the next year\n\nExtensive improvements to HealthWorks Fitness Center, including installing new flooring and exercise equipment, and replacing the parking lot, new classes, and a new member registration system\n\nUpdates to other parking lots and landscaping at the newly acquired locations\n\nRemoval of blighted buildings around the 1941 Virginia Ave. campus, also creating more green space.\n\nAdding a new ambulance to support transfers from the ED to other facilities\n\nAdding specialty services outreach including oncology and podiatry, with sleep lab in the planning stages\n\n\"We appreciate the positive reception from the community through our efforts to maintain as many sustainable healthcare services as possible,\" Dickman said. \"We remain committed to continuing to grow services appropriately to meet the needs of the entire region, including Fayette and surrounding counties.\"\n\nCambridge City Family Medicine Relocation: Room to Grow\n\nPosted July 28, 2020\n\nCambridge City Family Medicine's new home at 1154 South State Road 1, Suite 1, scheduled to open Aug. 3, brings more space and room for future expansion of services for patients in the long-time community medical practice. It also reopens with a new name - Reid Primary & Specialty Care - Cambridge City.\n\nThe practice is moving into what was the Alco and CVS building. James Bertsch, D.O., says the new location expands to 18 patient rooms from the previous seven. \"We are looking forward to what the new facility will provide for the community.\"\n\nThe practice reopens with a new name - Reid Primary & Specialty Care - Cambridge City.\n\nDr. Bertsch has practiced in Cambridge City for more than 40 years, and Ramona Orschell, NP, has been in the practice for more than 20.\n\nThe practice will now be housed in about 18,000 square feet. Dr. Bertsch notes the new location provides room for the practice to grow over the next decade, something his former location in one of the city's historic properties just didn't have the space to handle.\n\nThe extra room means the practice can eventually add X-ray and lab services. The new location also makes the possibility of adding specialist appointments as an option in the future.\n\nAlso housed in the new location are bays for Reid Health's ambulances serving that region. Ryan Williams, Director EMS, Forensics and Trauma Services, said the station will provide a great space for the crews and ambulances. \"The EMS station has a home-like feel much like an apartment,\" Williams said. It includes space for meal preparation, a wellness area and showers. \"The new station most importantly allows the ambulance to be more centrally located in the area for which we are responsible.\"\n\nThe 27,000 square foot building houses CVS Pharmacy, which will remain in its space.\n\n\"It's a smart move,\" Dr. Bertsch said when the move was announced, referring to an increasing demand for health care services in the Cambridge City area.\n\nPositive COVID-19 Cases Trending Up in Younger Population\n\nPosted July 28, 2020\n\nAs COVID-19 positive cases in the region seem to be heading upwards again, the cases are trending to a younger age group who may not be having as severe illness, according to a physician leader at Reid Health.\n\nThomas Huth, M.D., Vice President of Medical Affairs at Reid Health, has tracked COVID-19 world, regional and local trends since the pandemic began. While concerned about the increases in numbers, he does note one good thing so far - the severity of illness seems to be lessened and the death rate is remaining stable or even trending downward.\n\n\"There are often exceptions to the trends depending on the country or even the state when looking at the United States,\" Dr. Huth said. \"And this certainly does not mean we can let up in the precautions such as masking, hand-washing and social distancing,\" he said, noting the risk of the younger age group infecting their older and-or immune-compromised friends and family members.\n\nHe said over the last five months and particularly in July, the infection rate inpeople 20 to 29 has increased from less than eight percent of positives to 29 percent. Older age groups have generally declined, with the exception for people age 60-69, going from 20 percent to 43 percent of positive cases.\n\nSome possible reasons:\n\nYounger adults socializing more without paying attention to masking and social distancing, which may also be true of healthy adults in the 60-69 group\n\nOlder adults are generally being better protected, including those in nursing homes and long-term care facilities because of strict adherence to precautions.\n\n\"Scientific studies are proving masking is an effective tool in hindering the spread of COVID-19.\" -- Dr. Thomas Huth\n\nThe data from Reid Health -- though it shows a recent trend upward in the number of confirmed or suspected inpatients in COVID-19 containment areas - does not show a parallel increase in the number of COVID patients in Critical Care or on ventilators. It does show hospitalizations are weighted toward older patients with big jumps in ages 50-59, 60-69 and over 80.\n\nAt the highest point in late March, Reid Health logged 64 patients in COVID-19 containment areas. The number slowly trended into the 50s, 40s and 30s before hitting a low of 11 in early July before starting to go up again. In the last week, the numbers have gone up to a high of 28 on the 20th; as of Friday, had dropped to 22.\n\nChristine Stinson, Wayne County Health Department Director, said she believes one reason the local picture still shows some improvement despite the increase in positive cases is due to area long-term care facilities and nursing homes doing a good job with precautions, visitor restrictions and testing.\n\nBecause of an increase in positive tests, Indiana and Ohio are implementing mandatory masking inside buildings and in public spaces where social distancing can't be accomplished. Dr. Huth and Stinson strongly recommend all guidelines be followed to try to keep another wave of illness from occurring.\n\n\"Scientific studies are proving masking is an effective tool in hindering the spread of COVID-19,\" Dr. Huth said. \"Since it is becoming clearer this disease spreads through respiratory droplets and even vapor, and that masking is very effective at capturing droplets and reducing the distance vapors travel.\"\n\nGrants: More Than $150,000 to Promote Physical Activity, Good Nutrition & Weight\n\nPosted July 28, 2020\n\nReid Health Community Benefit is awarding $150,378 in grants for 25 programs throughout Reid Health's service area.

The process to dissolve the Foundation and transfer assets of approximately $750,000 was completed this summer.\n\nMcNally and Melanie Caldwell, another longtime member of the Fayette Regional Foundation, and several of their board members met with Reid Health Foundation representatives in Summer 2019 to begin exploring options.\n\n\"Reid Foundation was willing to acknowledge Fayette's existing funds and will spend those funds for their stated purpose in what was the Fayette Regional Health System area,\" McNally said.\n\nRandy Kirk, Reid Health Vice President/Foundation President, said his board appreciated the fact that the Fayette group had other options in dissolving the organization, yet chose to roll the assets to Reid Health Foundation with a goal of targeting programs in Connersville with funds going forward. \"We are humbled and very grateful for their decision.

The 12-month, 36-credit residential program combines coursework and a culminating practicum or internship based on the student's interests in the areas of social justice, public service or interfaith work. The program will use a cohort model, in which a group of students will take the same sequence of classes together throughout their studies.\n\n\"We see this program as an important outgrowth of our mission that will broaden our appeal to students who are seeking a seminary education but not necessarily looking to become a pastor or pursue vocations in academic ministry,\" said Matt Hisrich, dean of the Earlham School of Religion.\n\n\"We have designed this program with these students in mind,\" he notes. \"Earning a master's degree in one year is an attractive option.\"\n\nThe program shares several courses with ESR's Master of Divinity program. Courses in theology, Biblical studies, and interfaith dialogue or contextual theology provide grounding in the religious heritage and critical tools for understanding and compassionately engaging a complex, often oppressive society. Students will have the opportunity to develop peace and justice skills and to specialize their ministry through out-of-the-classroom experiences with partnering organizations in the local community or with an organization identified by students elsewhere in the world.\n\n\"This professional master's degree provides a unique and focused opportunity for our students to explore the connection between spirituality, justice and peacemaking,\" said ESR Professor of Peace and Justice Studies Lonnie Valentine, who is leading the program. \"Graduates will have a foundation of spiritual self-understanding to ground their justice work so that they may help heal the world that so needs our care.\"\n\nStudents enrolled in the inaugural cohort are from five states â Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New York â and three countries â Kenya, Congo and Mexico. They bring extensive experience with activism, service and interfaith work at organizations like the Friends Committee on National Legislation and Quaker Voluntary Service.\n\n\"When we announced the new degree program last fall we had a strong response from prospective students,\" said Julie Dishman, ESR's director of recruitment and admissions. \"Little did we know the uncertainty and turmoil 2020 would bring, but now this program feels even more relevant as we prepare for the arrival of the first cohort.\"\n\nDishman is especially pleased with the \"array of gifts and experiences\" these students are bringing and their expected contributions to a program focused on social transformation. \"It feels like the right time and the right place,\" she said.\n\nESR is offering full-tuition scholarships to all enrollees in the first cohort. Scholarships for future cohorts will be determined based on interest.\n\nEnrollment for the program's second cohort begins spring 2021.
