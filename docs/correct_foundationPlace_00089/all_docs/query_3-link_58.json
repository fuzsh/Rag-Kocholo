We share our findings so we can help kids everywhere, even those we’ll never meet.\n\nWe created the Nemours app to help you easily manage your child’s main condition or concern, as well manage other aspects of your child’s health care. The app is interactive, so it quickly assesses how your child is doing, and tells you what steps you should take. It also lets you communicate with your care team, track appointments and symptoms, access your child’s medical records, and launch video doctor visits on demand."
