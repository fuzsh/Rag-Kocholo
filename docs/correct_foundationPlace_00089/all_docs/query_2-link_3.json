        "text": "Our goal is to inspire philanthropy and assist donors who wish to make a positive impact. We are dedicated to raising awareness of needs across the community and to helping you support the causes you care about most.\n\nWhether it’s the arts, health care, education, human services, the environment, or another cause, we have flexible giving options that can help you do good in the communities you love.\n\nOur impact is long standing. The foundation’s inherited programs have addressed critical needs in Delaware County for more than 30 years. Our portfolio of public health programs focused on improving the health of mothers and children includes Healthy Start, Nurse-Family Partnership and WIC – all federally funded maternal health programs.\n\nThese programs serve as an anchor for the foundation’s efforts to address the social determinants of health including our new Housing Opportunities Program for Equity (HOPE).\n\nRestricted funds inherited from the sale of the Crozer-Keystone Health System enable us to focus on several other public health issues including supporting people with cancer, helping seniors age in place and inspiring teens to succeed. Public health is also addressed through our special initiatives and grantmaking.\n\nThe foundation serves as a leader addressing issues of importance in county life, bringing together partners who share similar goals, lending a county-wide perspective to important conversations, and providing a model of effective practices for other nonprofits.\n\nDelaware County Funders Group: We established the Delaware County Funders Group to promote collaboration and share information among regional and local funders interested in investing in Delaware County. For more information, please reach out to Frances Sheehan.\n\nCenter for Nonprofit Excellence: Established in 2019, the CNEx provides capacity building opportunities for nonprofit leaders serving Delaware County. CNEx offers monthly learning opportunities, the peer learning circle program and nonprofit management certificate program, and more. To learn more, contact CNEx here.\n\nDelaware County Rental Housing Coalition led by The Housing Opportunities Program for Equity (HOPE): The coalition, comprising various traditional and non-traditional stakeholders, collaborates to develop and implement robust strategies dedicated to addressing housing issues in Delaware County.\n\nThe coalition focuses on three primary priorities: Education, Eviction Diversion, and Supply. Education initiatives aim to empower tenants and landlords with the knowledge and resources needed to rent and lease effectively and lawfully, while also educating municipalities about the importance of supporting affordable housing policies. The Eviction Diversion program will work to prevent evictions through mediation services, rental assistance, and support for maintaining housing stability, ensuring that both tenants and landlords can find sustainable solutions to disputes. Lastly, the Supply priority focuses on increasing the availability of affordable housing through systemic advocacy and development efforts with a focus on expanding housing options for low-income families throughout the county. This collaborative effort and focus have enabled the coalition to make a significant impact on these issues in Delaware County."
