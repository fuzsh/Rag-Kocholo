        "text": "In November 2014, our historic Linden Tree fell to its demise. The story of the Linden Tree is one of historical significance laced with a bit of folklore. The Legend of the Linden Tree is a cherished story, handed down for generations in Shelby County.\n\nIt was told that the Miami Indian Chief, Mopiti, lived just south of the confluence of the Big Bear River (Big Blue) and the Little Bear River (Little Blue) in a village with his tribe, wife and seven children. Linden trees were abundant, and their wood was used for housing, building of canoes and for brewing as a tea. One day while the men were heading out for a hunt upstream in Passemong, the Miami village was plundered by a Delaware tribe, and all of the elders, women and children, including Mopiti’s seven sons and wife Kela, were killed. Upon their return, the men viewed the horror of those who had been slain, and an abrupt electrical storm began. Mopiti’s favorite tree, a large Linden tree, was struck by lightning, splitting it in two. The braves vowed revenge, and went in pursuit of the Delaware tribe - only to be ambushed. All of the Miami tribe were killed, except for Mopiti and two other braves; they survived.\n\nMopiti moved on and settled in a village near the Flat Rock River. Years later, Mopiti returned to his old home place. He found his favorite old Linden tree, fallen and rotting. Looking carefully at the base of the tree, Mopiti saw seven new shoots sprouting from the ground. He took this as a sign his seven sons' spirits were reincarnated into trees. Once a year, Mopiti would return to the tree to pay homage to the seven sons he lost.\n\nMost of the tree was not in good condition - age had made many of its trunks rot and decay. However, we were able to save 10 large stump pieces, making them into tables, and enough dimensional lumber was saved for our state of Indiana pieces, along with turned candlesticks. We employed local woodsmith John Norris for the tasks of hand hewning the pieces. Plaques have been imbedded in the stumps - covered by glass-tops for protection. Due to the small amount of available Linden Tree mementos, these pieces have been given out to charitable organizations for use in auctions or to keep in their facilities.\n\nAs the county coordinator - I also spearhead the Torch Relay. I think when those who were nominated began receiving their letters - and began calling in to accept - these were some of the best conversations I have ever had with people. Many asking “why me? “What have I done to deserve this honor?”\n\nI had nominated Connie Larkey on my own. A woman who has fought breast cancer not once, but twice. She turned her struggles in to a fundraising powerhouse with an event called “The Pink Out Game,” a yearly girls high school basketball game at Triton Central High School that has thus far garnered over $200,000 for the IWIN Foundation. IWIN, Indiana Women In Need, is a foundation that helps women who need financial and support assistance.\n\nConnie has worked feverishly at creating an event that brings in donations from across Indiana for the silent auction, but most importantly, gives women who are currently fighting or have fought, an opportunity to shine during the survivors walk.\n\nMax Bettner nominated his father, a WWII survivor who was at Normandy on that fateful day and for weeks afterward. Max said once his father knew he was nominated as a torchbearer, he began running laps daily around the manufacturing facility their family owns - preparing himself to run his portion of the relay. An 88 year old man determined he wasn’t walking his portion - he was going to run. And he did!"
