        "text": "Learn more about making a planned gift at DSU by reading through this section of our website or by contacting the Division of Institutional Advancement at dsufoundation [at] desu.edu (subject: Request%20for%20Info%20on%20Making%20a%20Planned%20Gift%20to%20DSU) or 302.857.6055.\n\nThe following are two popular planned giving options that you may want to consider:\n\nBequests: Bequests are a popular tool that you can use to include the Delaware State University Foundation in your estate plans. A bequest is a provision in your will that directs monies or property to go to specified individuals or organizations upon your passing. It is as simple as including a line such as the following: “I/We give, devise and bequeath $_______ (specific dollar amount or percentage) of my/our estate to the Delaware State University Foundation, Inc. located at 1200 N. DuPont Highway, Dover, DE 19901. (Tax ID 20-1372435).” in your will and your estate attorney can assist you in drafting.\n\nIncluding the Delaware State University Foundation in your will as a contingent beneficiary in the event your primary beneficiary or beneficiaries do not survive you is another option. An example of a contingent bequest provision is: “In the event that (name of beneficiary) predeceases me, I give, devise and bequeath his/her bequest or share to the Delaware State University Foundation, Inc. located at N. DuPont Highway, Dover, DE 19901. (Tax ID 20-1372435).” Your legal counsel will be able to assist you in drafting this provision as well.\n\nLife Income Gift: You may also want to consider establishing a charitable gift annuity through a cash or stock gift to the Delaware State University Foundation. Charitable gift annuities provide income—often with an annual return greater than most bank Certificates of Deposits—to the donor(s) for life, after which the assets utilized to create the annuity are distributed to the Foundation. This type of gift has the dual advantages of providing income to the donor and serving as a significant tax-deductible gift. Contact the Division of Institutional Advancement for more information at dsufoundation [at] desu.edu (subject: Request%20for%20Info%20on%20Life%20Income%20Gifts) or 302.857.6055.\n\nThese explanations have been provided for general information purposes only and do not constitute either tax or legal advice. We recommend that you consult an attorney, financial advisor and/or tax professional."
