Based on the concept of science with practice, or learning by doing. E360 is much more than an internship program.\n\nAre bees making a comeback? You may have heard that the bee population is under threat in recent years. Bees are critical for our environment and food production - a dwindling population could affect our ability to grow fruits and vegetables. But, The Washington Post recently reported that Americaâ€™s honeybee population is at an all-time high. Dr. Vincent Aloyo joins Matt Leon, host of KYW Newsradio's In-Depth Podcast, to talk about why we need bees, why their numbers decreased, and what we can do to keep the bee population on track.\n\nRegister for our Introductory Beekeeping Course at DelVal\n\nDelaware Valley University is pleased to be part of The College Tour streaming series!\n\nI look forward to sharing my expertise with DelVal students through the courses I will teach, and also by offering them research opportunities."
