        "meta_description": "Abstract. The air at the surface of the high Antarctic Plateau is\nvery cold, dry and clean. Under such conditions, the atmospheric moisture can\nsignificantly deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, and\nsupersaturation with respect to ice can occur. Most conventional humidity\nsensors for meteorological applications cannot report supersaturation in\nthis environment. A simple approach for measuring supersaturation using\nconventional instruments, with one being operated in a heated airflow, is\npresented. Since 2018, this instrumental setup has been deployed at three levels in\nthe lower â¼40âm above the surface at Dome C on the high\nAntarctic Plateau. A resulting 3-year (2018â2020) record (Genthon et al., 2021a) is\npresented and analyzed for features such as the frequency of supersaturation\nwith respect to ice, diurnal and seasonal variability, and vertical\ndistribution. As supercooled liquid water droplets are frequently observed\nin clouds at the temperatures experienced on the high Antarctic Plateau, the\ndistribution of relative humidity with respect to liquid water at Dome C is\nalso discussed. It is suggested that, while not strictly mimicking the\nconditions of the high troposphere, the surface atmosphere on the Antarctic\nPlateau is a convenient natural laboratory to test parametrizations of cold\nmicrophysics predominantly developed to handle the genesis of high\ntropospheric clouds. Data are available from the PANGAEA data repository at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.939425 (Genthon et al.,\n2021a).",

In this study, we use innovative humidity measurements at Concordia Station to study the formation of ice fogs at temperatures <−40°C. We provide observational evidence that ice fogs can form through the homogeneous freezing of solution aerosols, a common nucleation pathway for cirrus clouds.\n\n10 years of temperature and wind observation on a 45 m tower at Dome C, East Antarctic plateau\n\nChristophe Genthon, Dana Veron, Etienne Vignon, Delphine Six, Jean-Louis Dufresne, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, Emmanuelle Sultan, and FranÃ§ois Forget\n\nEarth Syst.

This is obtained with sensors at six levels along a tower higher than 40 m. The temperature inversion can reach more than 25 Â°C along the tower in winter, while full mixing by convection can occur in summer. Different amplitudes of variability for wind and temperature at the different levels reflect different signatures of solar vs. synoptic forcing of the boundary layer.\n\nBrief communication: Evaluating Antarctic precipitation in ERA5 and CMIP6 against CloudSat observations\n\nMarie-Laure Roussel, Florentin Lemonnier, Christophe Genthon, and Gerhard Krinner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2715–2727, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2715-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2715-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic precipitation is evaluated against space radar data in the most recent climate model intercomparison CMIP6 and reanalysis ERA5. The seasonal cycle is mostly well reproduced, but relative errors are higher in areas of complex topography, particularly in the higher-resolution models. At continental and regional scales all results are biased high, with no significant progress in the more recent models. Predicting Antarctic contribution to sea level still requires model improvements.\n\nEvaluation of coastal Antarctic precipitation in MAR3.9 regional and LMDz6 global atmospheric model with ground-based radar observations\n\nFlorentin Lemonnier, AlizÃ©e Chemison, Hubert GallÃ©e, Gerhard Krinner, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, Chantal Claud, and Christophe Genthon\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2020-167,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2020-167, 2020\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the first evaluation from snowfall observations in Antarctica of the general circulation model LMDz (global), the atmospheric component of the coupled IPSL Climate Model that is part of CMIP6 (IPCC). We also present an evaluation of the new version of the MAR model (regional), considered as a reference in terms of polar climate modelling. Both models show satisfying results for the modelling of precipitation in Antarctica.\n\nThe vertical structure of precipitation at two stations in East Antarctica derived from micro rain radars\n\nClaudio DurÃ¡n-AlarcÃ³n, Brice Boudevillain, Christophe Genthon, Jacopo Grazioli, Niels Souverijns, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, Irina V. Gorodetskaya, and Alexis Berne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 247–264, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-247-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-247-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation is the main input in the surface mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet, but it is still poorly understood due to a lack of observations in this region. We analyzed the vertical structure of the precipitation using multiyear observation of vertically pointing micro rain radars (MRRs) at two stations located in East Antarctica. The use of MRRs showed the potential to study the effect of climatology and hydrometeor microphysics on the vertical structure of Antarctic precipitation.\n\nPrecipitation at Dumont d'Urville, AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica: the APRES3 field campaigns dataset\n\nChristophe Genthon, Alexis Berne, Jacopo Grazioli, Claudio DurÃ¡n AlarcÃ³n, Christophe Praz, and Brice Boudevillain\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 1605–1612, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1605-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1605-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctica suffers from a severe shortage of in situ observations of precipitation. The APRES3 program contributes to improving observation from both the surface and from space. A field campaign with various instruments was deployed at the coast of AdÃ©lie Land, with an intensive observing period in austral summer 2015–16, then continuous radar monitoring through 2016 and beyond. This paper provides a compact presentation of the APRES3 dataset, which is now made open to the scientific community.\n\nArchival processes of the water stable isotope signal in East Antarctic ice cores\n\nMathieu Casado, Amaelle Landais, Ghislain Picard, Thomas MÃ¼nch, Thomas Laepple, Barbara Stenni, Giuliano Dreossi, Alexey Ekaykin, Laurent Arnaud, Christophe Genthon, Alexandra Touzeau, Valerie Masson-Delmotte, and Jean Jouzel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1745–1766, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1745-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1745-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce core isotopic records rely on the knowledge of the processes involved in the archival processes of the snow. In the East Antarctic Plateau, post-deposition processes strongly affect the signal found in the surface and buried snow compared to the initial climatic signal. We evaluate the different contributions to the surface snow isotopic composition between the precipitation and the exchanges with the atmosphere and the variability of the isotopic signal found in profiles from snow pits.\n\nMeasurements of precipitation in Dumont d'Urville, AdÃ©lie Land,Â EastÂ Antarctica\n\nJacopo Grazioli, Christophe Genthon, Brice Boudevillain, Claudio Duran-Alarcon, Massimo Del Guasta, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, and Alexis Berne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1797–1811, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1797-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1797-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present medium and long-term measurements of precipitation in a coastal region of Antarctica. These measurements are among the first of their kind on the Antarctic continent and combine remote sensing with in situ observations. The benefits of this synergy are demonstrated and the lessons learned from this measurements, which are still ongoing, are very important for the creation of similar observatories elsewhere on the continent.\n\nAtmospheric moisture supersaturation in the near-surface atmosphere at DomeÂ C, Antarctic Plateau\n\nChristophe Genthon, Luc Piard, Etienne Vignon, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, Mathieu Casado, and Hubert GallÃ©e\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 691–704, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-691-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-691-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNatural atmospheric supersaturation is a norm rather than an exception at the surface of Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau. This is reported by hygrometers adapted to perform in extreme cold environments and avoid release of excess moisture before it is measured. One year of observation shows that atmospheric models with cold microphysics parameterizations designed for high altitude cirrus reproduce frequently but fail with the detailed statistics of supersaturation at the surface of Dome C.\n\nContinuous measurements of isotopic composition of water vapour on the East Antarctic Plateau\n\nMathieu Casado, Amaelle Landais, ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, Christophe Genthon, Erik Kerstel, Samir Kassi, Laurent Arnaud, Ghislain Picard, Frederic Prie, Olivier Cattani, Hans-Christian Steen-Larsen, Etienne Vignon, and Peter Cermak\n\nAtmos.

New developments in infrared spectroscopy enable now the measurement of isotopic composition in water vapour traces (down to 20 ppmv). Here we present the results results of a first campaign of measurement of isotopic composition of water vapour in Concordia, the site where the 800 000 years long ice core was drilled.\n\nComparison between observed and simulated aeolian snow mass fluxes in AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica\n\nC.

MAR is generally in very good agreement with the observations and provides sufficiently reliable information about surface turbulent fluxes and vertical profiles of vertical diffusion coefficients when discussing the representativeness of chemical measurements made nearby the ground surface at Dome C.\n\nA case study of a low-level jet during OPALE\n\nH.

This paper illustrates in a 3-D simulation the respective influences of the large-scale pressure gradient force and turbulence on the onset of the low-level jet. As atmospheric turbulence plays a key role in explaining the behaviour of chemical tracers during the OPALE campaign, this paper also increases our confidence in using the outputs of the model for this purpose.\n\nBlowing snow in coastal AdÃ©lie Land, Antarctica: three atmospheric-moisture issues\n\nH.

Quantifying the rate at which ice deforms under its own weight is critical to assessing glacier evolution. This study uses borehole instrumentation in an Alpine glacier to quantify ice deformation and constrain its viscosity in a natural setting. Our results show that the viscosity of ice at 0° C is largely influenced by interstitial liquid water which enhances ice deformation.\n\nSurface processes and drivers of the snow water stable isotopic composition at Dome C, East Antarctica – a multi-datasets and modelling analysis\n\nInÃ¨s Ollivier, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Barbara Stenni, Laurent Arnaud, Mathieu Casado, Alexandre Cauquoin, Giuliano Dreossi, Christophe Genthon, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Minster, Ghislain Picard, Martin Werner, and AmaÃ«lle Landais\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-685,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-685, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe role of post-depositional processes taking place at the ice sheet's surface on the water stable isotope signal measured in polar ice cores is not fully understood.

Their measurements, along with atmospheric simulations and reanalyses, have been used to study the spatial variability in precipitation over the region, as well as investigate the interaction between the complex terrain and the typical flow associated with precipitating systems.\n\nReanalysis representation of low-level winds in the Antarctic near-coastal region\n\nThomas Caton Harrison, Stavroula Biri, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, John C. King, Elizabeth C. Kent, Ãtienne Vignon, and John Turner\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1415–1437, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1415-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1415-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEasterly winds encircle Antarctica, impacting sea ice and helping drive ocean currents which shield ice shelves from warmer waters. Reanalysis datasets give us our most complete picture of how these winds behave. In this paper we use satellite data, surface measurements and weather balloons to test how realistic recent reanalysis estimates are. The winds are generally accurate, especially in the most recent of the datasets, but important short-term variations are often misrepresented.\n\nIce fog observed at cirrus temperatures at DomeÂ C, Antarctic Plateau\n\nÃtienne Vignon, Lea Raillard, Christophe Genthon, Massimo Del Guasta, Andrew J. Heymsfield, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, and Alexis Berne\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12857–12872, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12857-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12857-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe near-surface atmosphere over the Antarctic Plateau is cold and pristine and resembles to a certain extent the high troposphere where cirrus clouds form. In this study, we use innovative humidity measurements at Concordia Station to study the formation of ice fogs at temperatures <−40°C. We provide observational evidence that ice fogs can form through the homogeneous freezing of solution aerosols, a common nucleation pathway for cirrus clouds.\n\nClouds drive differences in future surface melt over the Antarctic ice shelves\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, Stefan Hofer, CÃ©cile Agosta, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Ella Gilbert, Louis Le Toumelin, Ãtienne Vignon, Hubert GallÃ©e, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2655–2669, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2655-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2655-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModel projections suggest large differences in future Antarctic surface melting even for similar greenhouse gas scenarios and warming rates. We show that clouds containing a larger amount of liquid water lead to stronger melt. As surface melt can trigger the collapse of the ice shelves (the safety band of the Antarctic Ice Sheet), clouds could be a major source of uncertainties in projections of sea level rise.\n\nGABLS4 intercomparison of snow models at Dome C in Antarctica\n\nPatrick Le Moigne, Eric Bazile, Anning Cheng, Emanuel Dutra, John M. Edwards, William Maurel, Irina Sandu, Olivier TraullÃ©, Etienne Vignon, Ayrton Zadra, and Weizhong Zheng\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2183–2202, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2183-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2183-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes an intercomparison of snow models, of varying complexity, used for numerical weather prediction or academic research. The results show that the simplest models are, under certain conditions, able to reproduce the surface temperature just as well as the most complex models. Moreover, the diversity of surface parameters of the models has a strong impact on the temporal variability of the components of the simulated surface energy balance.\n\nAn energy budget approach to understand the Arctic warming during the Last Interglacial\n\nMarie Sicard, Masa Kageyama, Sylvie Charbit, Pascale Braconnot, and Jean-Baptiste Madeleine\n\nClim. Past, 18, 607–629, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-607-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-607-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Last Interglacial (129–116 ka) is characterised by an increased summer insolation over the Arctic region, which leads to a strong temperature rise. The aim of this study is to identify and quantify the main processes and feedback causing this Arctic warming. Using the IPSL-CM6A-LR model, we investigate changes in the energy budget relative to the pre-industrial period. We highlight the crucial role of Arctic sea ice cover, ocean and clouds on the Last Interglacial Arctic warming.\n\nSecondary ice production processes in wintertime alpine mixed-phase clouds\n\nParaskevi Georgakaki, Georgia Sotiropoulou, Ãtienne Vignon, Anne-Claire Billault-Roux, Alexis Berne, and Athanasios Nenes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1965–1988, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1965-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1965-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe modelling study focuses on the importance of ice multiplication processes in orographic mixed-phase clouds, which is one of the least understood cloud types in the climate system. We show that the consideration of ice seeding and secondary ice production through ice–ice collisional breakup is essential for correct predictions of precipitation in mountainous terrain, with important implications for radiation processes.\n\n10 years of temperature and wind observation on a 45 m tower at Dome C, East Antarctic plateau\n\nChristophe Genthon, Dana Veron, Etienne Vignon, Delphine Six, Jean-Louis Dufresne, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, Emmanuelle Sultan, and FranÃ§ois Forget\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 5731–5746, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-5731-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-5731-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA 10-year dataset of observation in the atmospheric boundary layer at Dome C on the high Antarctic plateau is presented. This is obtained with sensors at six levels along a tower higher than 40 m. The temperature inversion can reach more than 25 Â°C along the tower in winter, while full mixing by convection can occur in summer. Different amplitudes of variability for wind and temperature at the different levels reflect different signatures of solar vs. synoptic forcing of the boundary layer.\n\nIdentification of snowfall microphysical processes from Eulerian vertical gradients of polarimetric radar variables\n\nNoÃ©mie Planat, JosuÃ© Gehring, Ãtienne Vignon, and Alexis Berne\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4543–4564, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4543-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4543-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe implement a new method to identify microphysical processes during cold precipitation events based on the sign of the vertical gradient of polarimetric radar variables. We analytically asses the meteorological conditions for this vertical analysis to hold, apply it on two study cases and successfully compare it with other methods informing about the microphysics. Finally, we are able to obtain the main vertical structure and characteristics of the different processes during these study cases.\n\nGeodetic point surface mass balances: a new approach to determine point surface mass balances on glaciers from remote sensing measurements\n\nChristian Vincent, Diego Cusicanqui, Bruno Jourdain, Olivier Laarman, Delphine Six, Adrien Gilbert, Andrea Walpersdorf, Antoine Rabatel, Luc Piard, Florent Gimbert, Olivier Gagliardini, Vincent Peyaud, Laurent Arnaud, Emmanuel Thibert, Fanny Brun, and Ugo Nanni\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1259–1276, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1259-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1259-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn situ glacier point mass balance data are crucial to assess climate change in different regions of the world. Unfortunately, these data are rare because huge efforts are required to conduct in situ measurements on glaciers. Here, we propose a new approach from remote sensing observations. The method has been tested on the Argentière and Mer de Glace glaciers (France). It should be possible to apply this method to high-spatial-resolution satellite images and on numerous glaciers in the world.\n\nSecondary ice production in summer clouds over the Antarctic coast: an underappreciated process in atmospheric models\n\nGeorgia Sotiropoulou, Ãtienne Vignon, Gillian Young, Hugh Morrison, Sebastian J. O'Shea, Thomas Lachlan-Cope, Alexis Berne, and Athanasios Nenes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 755–771, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-755-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-755-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSummer clouds have a significant impact on the radiation budget of the Antarctic surface and thus on ice-shelf melting. However, these are poorly represented in climate models due to errors in their microphysical structure, including the number of ice crystals that they contain. We show that breakup from ice particle collisions can substantially magnify the ice crystal number concentration with significant implications for surface radiation. This process is currently missing in climate models.\n\nBrief communication: Evaluating Antarctic precipitation in ERA5 and CMIP6 against CloudSat observations\n\nMarie-Laure Roussel, Florentin Lemonnier, Christophe Genthon, and Gerhard Krinner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2715–2727, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2715-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2715-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic precipitation is evaluated against space radar data in the most recent climate model intercomparison CMIP6 and reanalysis ERA5. The seasonal cycle is mostly well reproduced, but relative errors are higher in areas of complex topography, particularly in the higher-resolution models. At continental and regional scales all results are biased high, with no significant progress in the more recent models. Predicting Antarctic contribution to sea level still requires model improvements.\n\nEvaluation of coastal Antarctic precipitation in MAR3.9 regional and LMDz6 global atmospheric model with ground-based radar observations\n\nFlorentin Lemonnier, AlizÃ©e Chemison, Hubert GallÃ©e, Gerhard Krinner, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, Chantal Claud, and Christophe Genthon\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2020-167,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2020-167, 2020\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the first evaluation from snowfall observations in Antarctica of the general circulation model LMDz (global), the atmospheric component of the coupled IPSL Climate Model that is part of CMIP6 (IPCC). We also present an evaluation of the new version of the MAR model (regional), considered as a reference in terms of polar climate modelling. Both models show satisfying results for the modelling of precipitation in Antarctica.\n\nMicrophysics and dynamics of snowfall associated with a warm conveyor belt over Korea\n\nJosuÃ© Gehring, Annika Oertel, Ãtienne Vignon, Nicolas Jullien, Nikola Besic, and Alexis Berne\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7373–7392, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7373-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7373-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we analyse how large-scale meteorological conditions influenced the local enhancement of snowfall during an intense precipitation event in Korea. We used atmospheric models, weather radars and snowflake images. We found out that a rising airstream in the warm sector of the low pressure system associated to this event influenced the evolution of snowfall. This study highlights the importance of interactions between large and local scales in this intense precipitation event.\n\nSynoptic conditions and atmospheric moisture pathways associated with virga and precipitation over coastal AdÃ©lie Land in Antarctica\n\nNicolas Jullien, Ãtienne Vignon, Michael Sprenger, Franziska Aemisegger, and Alexis Berne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1685–1702, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1685-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1685-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlthough snowfall is the main input of water to the Antarctic ice sheet, snowflakes are often evaporated by dry and fierce winds near the surface of the continent. The amount of snow that actually reaches the ground is therefore considerably reduced. By analyzing the position of cyclones and fronts as well as by back-tracing the atmospheric moisture pathway towards Antarctica, this study explains in which meteorological conditions snowfall is either completely evaporated or reaches the ground.\n\nQuantification of seasonal and diurnal dynamics of subglacial channels using seismic observations on an Alpine glacier\n\nUgo Nanni, Florent Gimbert, Christian Vincent, Dominik GrÃ¤ff, Fabian Walter, Luc Piard, and Luc Moreau\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1475–1496, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1475-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1475-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study addresses key questions on the subglacial drainage system physics through a novel observational approach that overcomes traditional limitations. We conducted, over 2 years, measurements of the subglacial water-flow-induced seismic noise and of glacier basal sliding speeds. We then inverted for the subglacial channel's hydraulic pressure gradient and hydraulic radius and investigated the links between the equilibrium state of subglacial channels and glacier basal sliding.\n\nSupercooled liquid water cloud observed, analysed, and modelled at the top of the planetary boundary layer above Dome C, Antarctica\n\nPhilippe Ricaud, Massimo Del Guasta, Eric Bazile, Niramson Azouz, Angelo Lupi, Pierre Durand, Jean-Luc AttiÃ©, Dana Veron, Vincent Guidard, and Paolo Grigioni\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 4167–4191, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4167-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4167-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThin (~â100 m) supercooled liquid water (SLW, water staying in liquid phase below 0 Â°C) clouds have been detected, analysed, and modelled over the Dome C (Concordia, Antarctica) station during the austral summer 2018–2019 using observations and meteorological analyses. The SLW clouds were observed at the top of the planetary boundary layer and the SLW content was always strongly underestimated by the model indicating an incorrect simulation of the surface energy budget of the Antarctic Plateau.\n\nStrong changes in englacial temperatures despite insignificant changes in ice thickness at DÃ´me du GoÃ»ter glacier (Mont Blanc area)\n\nChristian Vincent, Adrien Gilbert, Bruno Jourdain, Luc Piard, Patrick Ginot, Vladimir Mikhalenko, Philippe Possenti, Emmanuel Le Meur, Olivier Laarman, and Delphine Six\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 925–934, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-925-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-925-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe observed very low glacier thickness changes over the last decades at very-high-elevation glaciated areas on Mont Blanc. Conversely, measurements performed in deep boreholes since 1994 reveal strong changes in englacial temperature reaching 1.5 °C at a depth of 50 m. We conclude that at such very high elevations, current changes in climate do not lead to visible changes in glacier thickness but cause invisible changes within the glacier in terms of englacial temperatures.\n\nOn the fine vertical structure of the low troposphere over the coastal margins of East Antarctica\n\nÃtienne Vignon, Olivier TraullÃ©, and Alexis Berne\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 4659–4683, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4659-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4659-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe future sea-level rise will depend on how much the Antarctic ice sheet gain â via precipitation â or loose mass. The simulation of precipitation by numerical models used for projections depends on the representation of the atmospheric circulation over and around Antarctica. Using daily measurements from balloon soundings at nine Antarctic stations, this study characterizes the structure of the atmosphere over the Antarctic coast and its representation in atmospheric simulations.\n\nThe vertical structure of precipitation at two stations in East Antarctica derived from micro rain radars\n\nClaudio DurÃ¡n-AlarcÃ³n, Brice Boudevillain, Christophe Genthon, Jacopo Grazioli, Niels Souverijns, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, Irina V. Gorodetskaya, and Alexis Berne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 247–264, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-247-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-247-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation is the main input in the surface mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet, but it is still poorly understood due to a lack of observations in this region. We analyzed the vertical structure of the precipitation using multiyear observation of vertically pointing micro rain radars (MRRs) at two stations located in East Antarctica. The use of MRRs showed the potential to study the effect of climatology and hydrometeor microphysics on the vertical structure of Antarctic precipitation.\n\nPrecipitation at Dumont d'Urville, AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica: the APRES3 field campaigns dataset\n\nChristophe Genthon, Alexis Berne, Jacopo Grazioli, Claudio DurÃ¡n AlarcÃ³n, Christophe Praz, and Brice Boudevillain\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 1605–1612, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1605-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1605-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctica suffers from a severe shortage of in situ observations of precipitation. The APRES3 program contributes to improving observation from both the surface and from space. A field campaign with various instruments was deployed at the coast of AdÃ©lie Land, with an intensive observing period in austral summer 2015–16, then continuous radar monitoring through 2016 and beyond. This paper provides a compact presentation of the APRES3 dataset, which is now made open to the scientific community.\n\nArchival processes of the water stable isotope signal in East Antarctic ice cores\n\nMathieu Casado, Amaelle Landais, Ghislain Picard, Thomas MÃ¼nch, Thomas Laepple, Barbara Stenni, Giuliano Dreossi, Alexey Ekaykin, Laurent Arnaud, Christophe Genthon, Alexandra Touzeau, Valerie Masson-Delmotte, and Jean Jouzel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1745–1766, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1745-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1745-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce core isotopic records rely on the knowledge of the processes involved in the archival processes of the snow. In the East Antarctic Plateau, post-deposition processes strongly affect the signal found in the surface and buried snow compared to the initial climatic signal. We evaluate the different contributions to the surface snow isotopic composition between the precipitation and the exchanges with the atmosphere and the variability of the isotopic signal found in profiles from snow pits.\n\nMeasurements of precipitation in Dumont d'Urville, AdÃ©lie Land,Â EastÂ Antarctica\n\nJacopo Grazioli, Christophe Genthon, Brice Boudevillain, Claudio Duran-Alarcon, Massimo Del Guasta, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, and Alexis Berne\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1797–1811, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1797-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1797-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present medium and long-term measurements of precipitation in a coastal region of Antarctica. These measurements are among the first of their kind on the Antarctic continent and combine remote sensing with in situ observations. The benefits of this synergy are demonstrated and the lessons learned from this measurements, which are still ongoing, are very important for the creation of similar observatories elsewhere on the continent.\n\nAtmospheric moisture supersaturation in the near-surface atmosphere at DomeÂ C, Antarctic Plateau\n\nChristophe Genthon, Luc Piard, Etienne Vignon, Jean-Baptiste Madeleine, Mathieu Casado, and Hubert GallÃ©e\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 691–704, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-691-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-691-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNatural atmospheric supersaturation is a norm rather than an exception at the surface of Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau. This is reported by hygrometers adapted to perform in extreme cold environments and avoid release of excess moisture before it is measured. One year of observation shows that atmospheric models with cold microphysics parameterizations designed for high altitude cirrus reproduce frequently but fail with the detailed statistics of supersaturation at the surface of Dome C.\n\nContinuous measurements of isotopic composition of water vapour on the East Antarctic Plateau\n\nMathieu Casado, Amaelle Landais, ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, Christophe Genthon, Erik Kerstel, Samir Kassi, Laurent Arnaud, Ghislain Picard, Frederic Prie, Olivier Cattani, Hans-Christian Steen-Larsen, Etienne Vignon, and Peter Cermak\n\nAtmos.

New developments in infrared spectroscopy enable now the measurement of isotopic composition in water vapour traces (down to 20 ppmv). Here we present the results results of a first campaign of measurement of isotopic composition of water vapour in Concordia, the site where the 800 000 years long ice core was drilled.\n\nComparison between observed and simulated aeolian snow mass fluxes in AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica\n\nC.

MAR is generally in very good agreement with the observations and provides sufficiently reliable information about surface turbulent fluxes and vertical profiles of vertical diffusion coefficients when discussing the representativeness of chemical measurements made nearby the ground surface at Dome C.\n\nA case study of a low-level jet during OPALE\n\nH.

This paper illustrates in a 3-D simulation the respective influences of the large-scale pressure gradient force and turbulence on the onset of the low-level jet. As atmospheric turbulence plays a key role in explaining the behaviour of chemical tracers during the OPALE campaign, this paper also increases our confidence in using the outputs of the model for this purpose.\n\nBlowing snow in coastal AdÃ©lie Land, Antarctica: three atmospheric-moisture issues\n\nH.
