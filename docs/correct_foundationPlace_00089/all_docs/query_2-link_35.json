        "text": "Why the Delaware River Watershed Protection Fund\n\nDraining 13 million acres across four states, the Delaware River is the source of drinking water for 15 million people, a web of diverse plant and animal life, a recreational destination, and the foundation of the region’s economy.\n\nThe river has become much cleaner since the 1970s, after the federal Clean Water Act regulated major pollution sources, like sewage and factory waste. But today contamination still enters the watershed from thousands of smaller sources, carried into streams and groundwater by runoff from roads, construction sites, suburbs, cities, farms, and logged and mined lands (see white paper, Investing in Strategies to Accelerate Conservation and Measure Impact in the Delaware River Watershed).\n\nAbout the Fund\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Delaware River Watershed Protection Fund seeks to ensure abundant, clean water through support of land protection and improved land use planning, as part of the broader Delaware River Watershed Initiative, a coordinated effort involving 65 organizations working together to protect and restore clean water in the Delaware River watershed. The Initiative, generously supported by the William Penn Foundation, supports land protection, restoration, and water quality monitoring in eight regions of the watershed. The William Penn Foundation has also commissioned an assessment of the contribution of capital investments in protection and restoration to ensure water quality.\n\nThrough the Fund, OSI provides three types of grants. More information about each of these grant types and instructions on how to apply can be found in our cloud-based RFP Resource Library.\n\nCapital Grants for the purchase of land and easements to permanently protect important watershed lands;\n\nTransaction Grants to jumpstart land conservation efforts; and,\n\nCatalyst Grants to integrate water quality science into strategic conservation or forest management plans, such as Open Space Plans, ordinances, or other mechanisms for the protection and stewardship of water resources. OSI encourages proposals that address climate change, flood hazard, and/or water justice.\n\nThe Fund also makes short-term, Low-Interest Loans to bridge gaps in public or private funding for land protection projects.\n\nThe Delaware River Watershed Protection Fund is generously supported by the William Penn Foundation.\n\nImpact of the Fund\n\nSince the launch of the Fund in 2014, OSI has approved Capital and Transaction Grants totaling $13.3 million for 85 projects that will preserve over 25,000 acres of land. These projects are expected to protect 136 miles of forested stream banks, 14,400 acres of headwaters, 9,200 acres of stream buffers, and 4,200 acres of wetlands. Read more about recent projects.\n\nComplementing these land protection efforts, OSI has made ten Catalyst Grants to integrate water quality and climate science into conservation and stewardship plans. For an example of planning work supported by the Catalyst program, Open Space and Flood Protection Plans developed in two townships in Warren County, NY.\n\nCapital and Transaction Grant Opportunities\n\n(1) Capital Grants\n\nThe Fund had previously made two types of capital grants: Forestland Capital Grants and Farm Buffer Capital Grants. In this final round, the Fund will only accept proposals for Forestland Capital Grants. Farm Buffer Capital Grants will not be offered.\n\nForestland Capital Grants apply to parcels that are currently at least 90% in forest and natural cover, or will be restored to, at least 90 percent natural cover.\n\nForestland Capital Grants cover a portion of the cost of purchasing land or easements and may also cover transaction costs, including cost of appraisals, surveys, title, environmental assessments and non-staff legal expenses, with the latter not to exceed 2% of the parcel’s Fair Market Value.\n\nThe Delaware River Watershed Protection Fund now has $7.5 million remaining to support land protection.\n\n(2) Transaction Grants\n\nTransaction Grants provide early support for forest land protection projects that are not ready to apply for a capital grant. Transaction Grants can cover the cost of one appraisal, title report, and environmental assessment. OSI will distribute Transaction Grants within two weeks of grant approval.\n\nFor Transaction Grant projects that later receive a Capital Grant, the Transaction Grant will be considered part of the total grant and subject to capital match requirements.\n\nNeither Capital nor Transaction Grant funds may be used to pay interest on loans, staff time, mileage, travel expenses, stewardship and fundraising costs, or general overhead. Note also that projects which close before applicants submit a proposal are not eligible for funding.\n\nCapital and Transaction Grants - Eligibility and Grant Criteria\n\nTo be eligible for capital or transaction grants, projects must meet the following requirements:\n\nBe located within the Delaware River watershed. Preference will be given to projects that build on previous DRWPF work and the extent that they protect water resources such as forest, headwaters, wetlands and active river area. To check the location of your project you may use the OSI Applications screening tool found HERE. At least 90% of the project and 90% of the area within 100 feet of water bodies must be in natural land cover. Qualifying land cover excludes mowing or grazing or other disturbances that would prevent forest regrowth. Projects with natural cover below the threshold must either a) apply for funding only for the portion of the property with 90% natural cover, or b) demonstrate that 90% or more of the area will revert to qualifying land cover.\n\nImpacts from upstream pollutant sources and surrounding land uses do not override the project’s contribution to water quality.\n\nBe spearheaded by an organization with the capacity and financial ability to execute the transaction and ensure long-term stewardship and management of the property consistent with the Fund’s objectives.\n\nOSI welcomes and encourages projects that return land to Indigenous management and ownership.\n\nForestland Capital grant projects must also meet these additional eligibility requirements (not required for Transaction grants).\n\nMeet the Match Requirements;\n\nMeet OSI Conservation Easement and Stewardship Standards for water quality; and\n\nMust be completed by December 1, 2025.\n\nCapital Grant Criteria\n\nOSI evaluates eligible Forestland projects against the following Grant criteria:\n\nBe located within the Delaware River Watershed;\n\nAchieve permanent protection through fee purchase of land or a conservation easement;\n\nLand Stewardship: Degree to which the project meets the Fund’s stewardship goals for the grant fund. See OSI Conservation Easement and Stewardship Standards;\n\nConversion pressure: Type and extent of conversion pressure on the project and surrounding parcels;\n\nTransaction Feasibility: Likelihood that the project will succeed and close before December 1, 2025, based on status of negotiations, purchase agreement, status of due diligence; funding secured for the project; applicant’s fundraising plan and experience in fundraising; and the applicants' experience in completing land transactions, financial health, and accreditation status;\n\nLeverage: The extent to which the proposed transaction will secure sufficient funding to meet or exceed OSI’s financial match requirements; and\n\nCo-benefits to water quality: Additional benefits of the project such as flood reduction, community benefits, habitat protection, landscape connectivity, partnership building, ecotourism, or new financing mechanisms.\n\nGrant Awards\n\nOSI makes grants to qualified land conservation organizations through a competitive process with the assistance of an advisory committee of experts from the region with knowledge of hydrology, land protection, planning, natural resources, and philanthropy. OSI staff and advisors review and make recommendations on all grant applications.\n\nAlthough there is no minimum or maximum grant size, Capital Grant awards are typically between $75,000 and $450,000 but may exceed that amount on a case-by-case basis for a project of large scale and high watershed resource value. Transaction Grants are capped at $25,000, unless otherwise agreed upon with Fund staff. Catalyst Grants typically range from $10,000 to $35,000.\n\nConservation Easements and Stewardship Standards\n\nTo ensure permanent protection of the land’s natural resource values and maintain or enhance water quality, capital projects must meet the Fund’s Conservation Easement and Stewardship Standards. OSI staff will review conservation easement and/or management plan language prior to distribution of grant funds. Forest management plans are required for all Forestland Protection capital grants.\n\nFinancial Match for Capital Projects\n\nThe Fund will prioritize capital projects that bring a 3:1 or greater financial match, meaning that for every dollar awarded by the Fund there is at least three dollars in additional capital funding. Funds will be allocated to projects that do not meet this match threshold in a manner that maximizes the stated outcomes of the fund.\n\nDonations, grants, and, in some cases, land can serve as match. Prior to grant distribution, grantees must provide a detailed accounting of all matching sources. See here for a more detailed description of match requirements.\n\nNo match is required for Transaction or Catalyst Grants.\n\nIf a project receiving a Transaction Grant applies for and receives a Capital grant, the Transaction Grant amount will be considered as part of the Capital grant when calculating match ratio for the Capital Grant."
