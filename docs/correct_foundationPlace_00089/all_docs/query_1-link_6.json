Since the day she was born Kayla has loved the spotlight, stage, singing, and performing. She loves making others smile and performing fills her with incredible joy and pride. \n\nLast night was the beginning of her ultimate dream‚Ä¶\n\nKayla was cast for a role as a movie actress. \nA. MOVIE. ACTRESS. \n\nShe will be playing Juliette Tanner in the feature film I WIN. \n\nThe movie is about friendship and being a good friend is something that no one does better than Kayla. \n\nThe summary‚Ä¶\nWhile doing community service, Jax Donovan meets a young man with Down Syndrome. He also befriends Bailey, and Juliette, and they forge a friendship that teaches them about love, life and forgiveness.\n\nDuring her audition, the director asked if she knew anything about the movie. Kayla said she knew the role she was auditioning for was Juliette Tanner and she wants to be the next Tanner girl. She shared that she ‚Äúloves Fuller House and the characters DJ and Stephanie Tanner, played by Candace Cameron Bure and Jodie Sweetin‚Äù. The director admitted that was an homage to one of her favorite shows, Full House, and was glad Kayla picked up on that too. I am pretty sure that‚Äôs the moment she secured herself the role. üòâ\n\nHer dreams are coming true! I am beaming with incredible pride and filled with happy tears. There is nothing any mom wants more than to see their child pursue their passion and live out their dreams. I have always known Kayla would do big things and change the world‚Ä¶this is just one more step in that direction. Congratulations, Kayla! You‚Äôre the next Tanner girl!\n\n#downsyndrome #actress #actor #downsyndromeactress #acting #featurefilm #downsyndromeawareness #downsyndromelove #downsyndromeacceptance #downsyndromerocks #theluckyfew #theluckyfewüíôüíõ #iwin #iwinthemovie #inclusion #dsdn #downsyndromemodel #downsyndromecommunity #sindromededown #downsyndromeisbeautiful @candacecbure @jodiesweetin #fullerhouse #fullhouse\".",
