The foundation is deeply committed to being a resource for local nonprofits now and for the long-term, helping them connect with the funding necessary to accomplish their missions. Together with generous support provided by the foundation’s charitable fund holders and the more than 9,000 donors who joined us on Delco Gives Day to give $1.7M, we are ensuring there is a strong financial investment in the organizations and initiatives in our community making lasting change.”\n\nChildren’s health and well-being is a funding priority. Grants include more than $56,000 to CASA Youth Advocates to support services that connect volunteers to youth in the child welfare system in Delaware County.\n\nAdditional grants include $16,000 to Teachers’ Teammates to ensure schools in the county have adequate supplies for students.\n\nThe foundation also gave a $16,000 grant to the Upper Darby Arts and Education Foundation to support children’s educational experience with music and arts programming.\n\nThe foundation also supports organizations enhancing community and economic development.\n\nA $12,000 grant was awarded to Regional Housing Legal Services to create housing opportunities for families in Delaware County.

One of 900 community foundations across the U.S., the foundation offers support and resources for nonprofits of every size, helps generous people give with more impact, brings together funders, nonprofits, and elected officials to address critical community problems, and responds to major challenges and crises as they arise.\n\nIn addition to grant funding, the foundation operates the Center for Nonprofit Excellence to strengthen Delaware County’s nonprofit community through training workshops and peer learning opportunities.\n\nThe foundation encourages philanthropy by connecting donors to worthy causes through efficient charitable giving vehicles like donor-advised and scholarship funds.
