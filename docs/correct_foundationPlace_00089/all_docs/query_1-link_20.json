For example, suppose you incorporated your company in Delaware and opened a restaurant in the District of Columbia under the same company. In that case, you will still need to register your corporation in DC, pay all DC taxes, and obtain licenses.\n\nHowever, if you plan to establish a Start-up company and raise funds from investors, you may need to register your corporation in Delaware."
