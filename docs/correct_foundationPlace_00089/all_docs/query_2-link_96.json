        "text": "Membership\n\nWith membership comes the opportunity to take part in many different groups, programs, and volunteer opportunities. The most important benefit of your membership is that it supports our mission. Your donation helps financially support our mission including women's leadership, arts and culture, and historic preservation.\n\nPrograms\n\nPrograms are the foundational element of the Indianapolis Propylaeum, as the place for women to learn, connect and grow. Propylaeum programs center around our mission focus of Women’s Leadership, Arts and Culture, and Historic Preservation. The Propylaeum’s intimate setting creates the opportunity to meet people not ordinarily available.\n\nPrivate Events\n\nThe beautifully maintained facilities have hosted hundreds of special events since 1924. Events here range from fundraisers, bridal showers, classes, corporate dinners, weddings, educational seminars, and everything in-between. Our expansive amenities offer guests the comfort of being able to plan a full-scale event with few other vendors, while our flexibility allows for partnering with a whole team of experts to make your event perfect.\n\nWomen’s Leadership Programming\n\nWomen's leadership is an integral part of the work that we do here at the Indianapolis Propylaeum. Our programming for Women's Leadership works to inspire the next generation of female leaders and provide direct access to these leaders, promoting individual networking, and strengthening community and industry partnerships in Indianapolis.​\n\n(photo by Andre Jefferson)\n\nArts & Culture Programs\n\nThe Arts and Cultural programs are a foundational element of the Indianapolis Propylaeum, as the place for women to learn, connect and grow. The Propylaeum has always been a supporter of the arts, especially the performing arts, and 'Propylaeum' translates to \"Gateway to Culture.\"\n\n(Photo by Adam Gibson Photography)\n\nHistoric Preservation\n\nThe Indianapolis Propylaeum values the historic preservation of original architecture in Indiana and upholds this value by maintaining the historic integrity of our 1890s mansion. We believe that preservation creates a strong sense of place and adds to the architectural and visual richness of the community by displaying the roots of its character and diversity. Additionally, we feature Historic Preservation topics and discussion at some of our programming.\n\n(photo by Adam Gibson Photography)"
