        "text": "National research indicates that by 2025, around 70% of family-sustaining jobs in Delaware will require at least some education beyond high school. Today, less than 60% of our 25-year-olds have that level of training.\n\nWe work with partners to provide students with options for life after high school—college, training, careers, or all of the above.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nAcademics are critical but so is a child’s social and emotional development. It’s important young people receive holistic educational experiences that maximize who they are as individuals.\n\nRodel is committed to improving social and emotional learning in Delaware through our work with the Rodel Teacher Council and other organizations.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nThe system Delaware employs to fund its public schools is more than 70 years old. It was built decades before desegregation and the introduction of technology.\n\nOur students deserve a modern, flexible funding system that suits their unique needs.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nDelaware is one of four states that does not provide additional state resources to English learners – students who come from non-English speaking homes and backgrounds. As the number of English learners in the state continues to grow, we need to better understand this population of students so we can effectively and equitably meet their needs.\n\nLEARN MORE"
