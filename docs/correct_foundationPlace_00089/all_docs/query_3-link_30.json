We deliver UGrad Education Academy – a program of excellence – to Delaware foster children. Through Kind to Kids, foster children receive a one-on-one educational advocate, private tutoring, and resources to succeed in school. Children in foster care receive My Blue Duffel emergency care kits to support them through a difficult time in their young lives and buffer the painful transition as they enter the foster care system. **Please note – Kind to Kids provides services to foster children through DFS, government organizations, nonprofit agencies and schools that serve foster children. We do not serve individual families.*****"
