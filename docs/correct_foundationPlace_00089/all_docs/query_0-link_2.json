Life gives too short a time now for a long work, bat it is a pleasure to have at least brought to an end this tale the origins of English verse. It begins in the older England over the sea. It ends with the atwessioD of .Alfred. When he came to the throne in 871. literattiTV, both Latin and English, bad perished, after a career of two hundred years. The final home of both had been Nor- tfatunbri^ A few years after his accession the last anplun-! dt'ted Beats of learning were destroyed. All the Muses wei» now silent But before .Elfred died a new English literature bod begun, and in a new land, and the King was himself its ori^n. What had been was poetry ; this was prose. The eouDtrj of English poetry had been Northumbria ; the country of English prose was Wessex. At this date, then, the curtain Batuially falls on the first act of this history. At this date, io cbe intervals of .Alfred's wars, it will naturally rise on the beginning of the second act The English literature of this period is entirely poetry, and this tiooh is mainly dedicated to that poetry. I have not put Asidi; the life of the people, the Latiu literature, or the politi- cal history of England ; but I have only spoken of them so far as tbey bore upon the poetry or illustrated it. That poetry is L (KTtainly not of a very fine quality, but it is frequently re- H narkable. It has its own special qualities, and with the ex- «t^ Ti EARLY ESGLISII LITERATURE ception of perhaps a few Welsh and Irish poems, it is the only vernacular poetry in Eiirope, outside of the classic touguea, which belongs to so early a time aa the seventh and eighth centuries. The Welsh and Irish poems are few, problematical, and their range is limited ; hut the English poems are numer- ous, well authenticated, and of a wide and varied range. In these two centuries our forefathers produced examples, and good examples for the time, of religious, narrative, elegiac, descriptive, and even, in some sort, of epic poetry. This is a fact of singular interest. There is nothing like it — at this early period — elsewhere in Europe. But the interest is even greater when we consider this poetry in connection with the whole of English song. It will be seen that .a great number of the main branches of the tree of English poetry had already opened out at this time from the stem, and that the ideal and sentimental elements of the earliest poetry have continued, with natural changes, up to the present day. Here, then, in the two hundred years between 670 and 870, the roots of English poetry, the roots of that vast over-shadowing tree, were set ; and here its first branches clothed themselves with leaves. Here, like the oaks of Dodona, it began to discourse its music ; and there is not a murmur unw of song in all its imme- morial boughs which does not echo from time to time with the themes and the passion of its first melodies. Here, too, we can best discern, and here isolate most easily, those elements in English character which, existing before the raee was mixed, have been, not the cause of our poetry, but the cause why the poetry has been of so high an excellence, — that steady con- sistency of national character, that clinging through all diffi- culty to the aim in view, that unrelenting curiosity, that desire to better what has been don«, which, though not art them- selves, are the effectual powers which enable art to strive, to seek, and at last to reach its goat. Moreover, no national art is good which is not plainly that nation's own. In this Anglo-Saxon poetry of which I write we grasp most clearly the dominant English essence. The L Til I p>rtnr of England has owed much tw the different races which mingled with the original English race; it has owed much to the different types of poetry it absorbed — Greek, Latin, WeUh, French, Italian, Spanish — Imt below all these admix- baOf the English n&ture wrought its steady wilL It seized, it tnosmated^ it modified, it mastered these admixtures both of iv^s and of soi^. Of what kind the early English poetry is, what feelings ius|jired the poets, what imaginations filled their hearts, how Jul they shape their wort — that is the vital, the interesting Uttestjoo ; and to answer it, the poetrj- itself must be read. I liATe therefore not written much about the poems, but I hare translated a great quantity of what seemed to me not only tiieit best, but also their most characteristic passages. I have ilso, when they were short enough, translated whole poems like the fourth Riddie and the Wanderer. Hov to tranalate them was my chief difficulty. It waa uceesaiy, above all, that the trajislation should be accurate, bat it was also necessary that it should have, as far as possible, tbe rhythmical movement of verse. Of all possible translations of pMttrir, a merely prose translation is the most inaccurate. Tti« translations here given are as accurate as I could make tbcm. I do not mean that there are no mistakes in them, — <rltieh would be an insolence I should soon repent. — but I infan that there is nothing out of my own fancy added to the inosSa^iL The original has been rigidly followed, and. for ^ EUMt part, line for line. I have nearly always bracketed i'iMrl«l words ; and the only licence I have taken is the intro- dartion of such words as then and (Acre and all, when I needed *a adititional syllable for the sake of the rhythm which I •dopted. Permission to do this was, I may say, given to me by th« Anglo-Saxon poets themselves ; it is tlieir constant habit. Then I felt that the translation should be in a rhytlim vhich shonld represent, as closely as I could make it, the oinivement and the variety of the original verse. A prose tr&ns- ^Uion, even when it reaches excellence, gives no idea whatever I t I of that to whidh the aacient English listened. The originaL form is destroyed, and with it our imagination of the world to which the poet sang, of the way he thougtit, of how he shaped. his emotion. Prose no more represents prjetry than architec- ture does music. Translations of poetry are never much good, but at least they should always endeavour to have the musical movement of poetry, and to obey the laws of the verse they translate. A translation made in any one of our existing rhyming metres seemed to me as much out of the question as a prose translation. None of these metres resemble those of Anglo- Saxon poetry ; and, moreover, their aasociations would modern- ise the old English thought. An Anglo-Saxon king in modem Court dress would not look more odd and miserable than an Anglo-Saxon poem in a modern rhyming metre. Blank verse is another matter. It frequently comes near to the \"short epic line \" of Cynewulf, but it fails in the elasticity which a translation of Anglo-Saxon poetry requires, and in itself is too stately, even in its feminine dramatic forms, to represent the cantering movement of old English verse. Moreover, it is weighted with the sound of Sliakspere, Milton, or Tennyson, and this association takes the reader away from the atmosphere of early English poetry. I f«lt myself then driven to invent a rhythmical movement which would enable me, while trans- lating literally, to follow the changes, and to express, with some little approach to truth, the proper ebb and flow of Anglo-Saxon verse. The Anglo-Saxon line is divided into two halves by a pause. The first half has two \"measures.\" and the first syllable of these is accented, or \" stressed,\" The second half has the same number of measures and accents. The binding together of these two halves is doue by alliteration. Generally speaking, the two accented syllables in the first half and one of the ac- cented syllables in the second half begin with the same conso- nant or with any vowels ; almost always with different vowels. Frequently, however, there is only one alliterated syllable in thf &nt half of the line. Uaaccented syllables, the greater number o( which were placed at the begiuuing of the second iiiil line, after the pause, tilled tip the line. One school of jwtg, of whom CynewTiIf was the chief, used a short line, with fev slurred syllables. Another school which has been called tiw Caedmonian School used a line with a varying number of nuccented syllables, and as a great number of these were often tuerted, the line baa been called the \"long epic line'' in con- trart with Cynewulfs shorter line. A poet of this school (ould use the shorter line when be pleased. He might have J line of only eight syllables, or one of three times that length, >i[i3,DdiQg it to express his swelling passion, or contracting it w suit a sharp question or a concise description. The variety Iben of the line was great, and ita elasticity. It was capable of rapidity and solemnity ; and its harmony and order were iemred by the last alliterated stress being on the first syllable \"f the last word but one of the fuU liue. In order to be able to fulfil these needs and follow these pwuliarities, I chose, after many experiments, the trochaic movement used in this book, eEtch half-line consisting of irochees following one another, with a syllable at the end, chiefly a long one, to mark the division of the line. I varied the line as much as I could, introducing, often rashly, metrical rhanges ; for the fault of this movement is its monotony. I hare Bometimeis tried an iambic movement, but rarely ; for ttiia trgchaic line with a beat at the end of each half-verse swmed to me to get the nearest to the sound of the Aiiglo- ^lon line, even though it ia frequently uii-similar to that liue iti*lf. I used alliteration whenever I could, and stressed as much as possible the alliterated words, and I changed the li-n?tb of the line with the changes of the original. But »lien I could not easily alliterate my line or stress the aJlit- 'mted word, I did not try to do so. It was better, I thought, to give literally the sense and the sentiment of the original tlian to str^u them or lose them by a rigid adherence to allit- eration and accent I have made clear the division of the J X EARLY ENGLISH LITERATURE Anglo-Saxon line by leaving a space in the midst of each line of my translation. The two half-lines are, of course, intended to be read right across the page, with a alight pause upon the apace between them. I think the method used is on the whole the right method, but I am by no means satisfied with what I have done. I submit it with much deference to those who understand the difficulties of such a translation. This book is written from the literary point of view, and desires, above all, to induce English-speaking folk to rever- ence, admire, and love the poetry which their fathers wrote in old time, since it is wortliy. I have not therefore, except when I thought it necessary, entered into the critical or scien- tific questions which hum like bees around the poems. On these questions a great number of books, reviews, and pam- phlets have been written. I have not avoided this side of the matter from any want of gratitude to the critics, or from any lack of appreciation of the work of Anglo-Saxon scholars. On the contrary, it is my duty and my pleasure to acknowl- edge, that were it not for the intimate and exhaustive labour of German, English, and American scholars, a book like this, which views the poetry of the ancient English only as literar ture, could not have been written at all, or, at least, not on any sure foundation. No translation worth reading, or giving a clear representation of what the Anglo-Saxon poets thought or felt, could have here been made, had it not been preceded by the long, careful and penetrating labour of the philologists ; nor could any just literary estimate of the poems or any use- ful arrangement of them have been worked out in this book, without the minute and accurate toil expended on them, and on their subjects, sources and dates by a multitude of critics among whom the Germans are pre-eminent. Moreover, had it not been for the labour and genius of the later historians of early England, especially of Mr. Green, 1 could not have had the materials for binding up, as I have tried to do, the poetry of England with the history of England. I cauDot, so numerous are they, mentiou the sumy scholars to whom my thanks ure due, but my gratitude to them is none rhs leas. VThere I have specially uaed the work of any one (if tbirMB I have acknowledged it in the text. Two, however above all, ought to be thanked by me, as they have been i tLinked by all who have cared for ancient English poetry, J Professor Grein is gone from lis, but he will never be forgot- 1 ten. To Ilia Dictionary I owe my first interest in the Anglo- 1 Saxon language, my first understanding of its power and T rharm. To his translation of the poems into German I owe J my tiret appreciation of tlie poetry of early England. The I Rading of that translation made me eager to read the poems I In the original, and I could not rest till I was able to do so. Wbea I had read them 1 could not rest till 1 had written this 1 book. The other scholar to whom this book owes so much is \\ Professor Wfilker. He needs no praise, but he may take grat- i itnde from me. Had it not been for his Oi-vndriss zvr Oe- KhiclUf der angeUiidmachev. LiUeratur, one like myself, who ] in life began to read the Anglo-Saxon literature, could never have found his way through the tangled mazes of Anglo-Saxoa , criticism, nor known what to look for, nor where to find his wants fulfilled. I cannot understand why the University Pro- fessors of Anglo-Saxon in this country do not have that book tmtslated. and edited up to date, 1 was fortunate enough while these pages were passing through the press to be in time to see Professor Earle's book, TV Dteda of Beowulf, and though I do not agree with his llwory of the origin of the poem, I wish to thank him for hav- ing, by his translation and notes, made Beowulf a more literary possession for the English people. I have also to thank Mr. Gollancz for permitting me to use the early proof sheets of his «dition of the Christ. I saw these sheets after I had made the tnnglations of the Christ contained in this book, and before he W re-written his translation as it now appears. I made some Ictangea in my translation and adopted some of his phrases. I •ho adopted his new division of the poem, and his ending of . it at line 1663.

The sugges- m that it is another name for Woden, and that Widsith is Jewfore a mythological (lerson, does not seem to have siiffi- Rent ground for its adoption. He is rather the \" poetic repre- ^DUtive of the singer \" who loved to wander from court to imrt and land to land; and his name, whether assumed by I unueU or given to him by an after-writer, expresses this very well The poem begins with an introduction of nine lines. This II followed by a catalogue, from the tenth to the seventy-fifth liw, of the various places and kings and tribes that Widsith ^ risited. An interpolation then of twelve lines succeeds, iad may have been inserted in the seventh centuiy, and in EnglnniL The conclusion contains a personal account of the '» way of living and of his last journey, and this runs on I verse 87 to the close.'

I ^^tA^ EAKLY EKGLISH LITEKATUKE ^ The Preface (lines 1-9) which may have been written in the uld Angle-land, tells us that Widsith, \" wlio moet of all men visited kindreds and nations, received in the hall for his sing- ing memorable gifts,\" Born among the Myrgings,' he becajue the singer of the court, and while still young went, in this capac- ity, \" with Queen Ealdhild the weaver of peace,\" the daughter of Eadwine and the wife of Eadgils Kiag of the Myrgings, to seek the home of Eormanric (Ilermanric), King of the Ostrogoths who lived \"east from Ongle\"; and this was his first journey. Here the Introduction ceases, and at the 10th line Widsith himself, writing in his old age, describes his journeys.' \" Many men and rulers I have known,\" he says; \"through many stranger-lands I have fared, throughout the spacious earth, Earted from my kinsmen. Therefore I may sing in the mead- all how the high burn gave me gifts.\" Two among the rest were most gracious to him, Guthere the Bui^ndian, ''who gave me an arm-ring, no sluggish king was he. and .^Elfwine' in Italy, Eadwine's bairn. He was of aJl men swifte.st of hand in winning of honour, and_freest of heart in the dealingof rings,\" These names occur in the long list of kings and trilKis whom he visited — a list which has certainly undergone some later interpolations. Many of the ancient names belong to the North German cycle of romance. A special place is given to Offa of Ongle. We hear also of personages known to us from Ithe poem of Beoiculf, of Finn, and Hnaef, of Hrothgar, Ingeld, and of the town of Heorot. It is a list of great importance for the history of the ancient tribes of Germany and for the heroic B^as of that country, but it has no literary value, and no per- sonal interest. The personal interest comes in at line 87, after an interpolation of twelve lines. Widsith tells of his voyage to Eormanric, of his return, of the welcome his lord gave nim, and of the songs he sung at home with his brother bard Scil- DjE as £lfre 1 Tlie Myrglnfis, the dwellers near the mart, lived porhain In the Elbe- land betweuD the Elbe and the Gyder, and were iieiglilKiiin of the Aii)Cl«, > I naminie liere. tor literary purpoBes, that the poem was written by one man, :r»onal accounl of his wanderiugs.

The poem liaa but little literary value, hut a certain literary charm is diffused over it by the names it enshrines — names of men concerning whom great sagas were written, aud whose geats and government made a noise which filled the ear of the world. If the writer really saw Hermanric and Attila before they became heroes of Teutonic saga, we transfer to him and to his poem our pleasure in their cycle of stories. The very possibility that he saw these men excites us. Moreover, if we consider the poem to be of the fifth century, the light of four cycles of lays is reflected backwards upon it. Its names bring before ua the sagas of Hennanric, of Alhoin, of Gudrun, and ■ Beowulf; the story of Offa, and of the fight at Finnaburg. We may be said to be present at the hirth and to watch over the cradle of these great Teutonic sagas. Even if the poem be of the seventh century, and these sagas are behind it and not before it, this reflected literary charm is still present. All the great figures rise before our eyes as we read their names in the dry detail of the eatiilogue. We may also bind it up with another fancy for which we have a good foundation. We may fairly imagine the delight of jElfred when be read this poem. The catalogue of tribes and kings, the geographical details it contains would fall in with the temper of the Iting who trans- lated and added to Orosius, who wrote down from Ohthere's ■ and Wulfstan's lips their voyages to the North Sea, and to the mouth of the Vistula, Moreover, the passion for roving, for , adventure, which is keen above all other nations in the people ^Ot OCT island, makes this poem representative of the English. wiDsrrn, deor, and the scop 8 Widsith is oar TTlyssea. \"I liave fared through many stranger hnilllhrough the spacioos earth; good and evil have Ikpowii.\" II it tbe true description of a conuuon type of EnglishDian in ■wij period of our history.

In his lunils their history lies, and their honour. Horace did not ftel more strongly the need of a sacred b:inl to chronicle great IS than did the earliest of English poets. The poem is then not only the story of wanderings, it also Atlciies tbe life and tbe repute of tbe Scop — tbe name giveri to tbe singer and poet who was retained in tbe court of a kinJ or ibe hall of a great noble.

This song is much later, I think, than Widtith. I t belongg to a time when the Gothic cycle of lays bad at least Mlwjtun, Hermanric has become legendary. Theodric has wnit! the fabulous hero. But the prominence of the story of vdand, and tbe mention of Qeat, localise tbe poem among tbe forthern Teutonic tribes. From these it was brought to Eog- \"i ifthaps by some belated Angles, if Sweet be right in bis \"JiJWture that it may have been eomposed before tbe English 'mtion. I think it is likely ta be much later, and to have I tD»iIe in England — it is put hy some as far on as tbe eighth Wtuiy, — hut no decision can be come to on the matter. Its V^ is remarkable.

One motive, constant throughout, is ex- I pressed in the refrain. Thia dominant cry of passion makea the poem a true lyric, and we ought to look upon it with pleasure, for it is the Father of all English lyries. Deor is not like Widsith, a treaanre -gifted singer, always in favour of hia lord. Like the Wanderer who looks back with mourning on the time when lie was liis master's favourite, he has been deprived of his rewards and lauds, and has seen a rival set above his head. It is thia whirlijig down of Fortune's wheel that he mourns in his song, and he compares his fate to that of others who have suffered, so that he may have some comfort. But the comfort is stern like that the Northmen take. Others, he thinks, have gone through great gi'iefs, and come out on the other side of them — so also may he win through his pain. Here is the song, and the legendary woes of which lie speaks show that the English knew the story of Weland well, the story of Geat, of Hermanric, of Theodric, and the tale which became in after years the saga of Gudnm — Weland for a nomiin ' fcnew too well ezilel Strong of Boul Ihat earl, aorrow sharp he bore ; To companlnnHhlp he had care and weaiy longing, Wlnter-freeiing wretchedneBB.

It is the b[Iit;-niutb riddle of CjTiewulf which Dietrich has happily a the Wandering Singer — ' I have Introduced king Into the text i EAULV EKGr.ISH LITERATURE c ^theling am I, aiid to enrla am known ; And not rarely do I rest with the rich and with the poor ; Midflt the Folks I'm famoos.

I If this riddle be by Cynowtilf, aa I thiuk it is, he sketches in it his own position and temperament, and with that, the position and temperament of the Scop. He was not only I ennobled and at home with the rich, but also sang with the poor and stayed in tlieir houses. He loved to win gifts and rings, and to excite the warriors wlio roved for plunder; but jhe sang a different kind of song to the elder and wiser men. And we may judge from all that is left to us that these songs of 1\" wisdom\" wei'e the great sagas like Beowulf, tales of law and 'justice and noble war; sometimes riddles and gnomic verses iitted for well-wjtted men ; even songs of history like that of WidsUh; and, when he had so sung, all men sat silent, listen- ing. Moreover, he was eagerly sought after, but it was often his habit, like many of his clan, to hide himseli in solitude, musing like his fellow in Beowulf on new poems ; or indulging tlie melancholy found in tlie Lament of Dear, and which lay deep in the temperament of Cynewulf. Of this there is ample proof at the end of the Eleiie. In that poem Cynewull sketches his early life as a poet. Once he received Treasures and appled gold, — omie his youth was swift and happy, but now all joy was fled away, and sore had been hia trouble. But at last, when he seemed to have lost the art of weaving words, God \" unbound his breast, unlocked the craft of song, and again he practised with delight his vexing.\" Cynewulf had been then a Sc8p attached to a court, and also a wandering singer. He had had his pleasure and also his pain — had been \"Widsith and Deor in one. I When, however, we meet with the wandering Scop we meet With that whiuh is not usual.

These were the ^mueo, though their name is sometimes given to the Scop — »nd in later Anglo-Saxon times, they were not unfrequently •Mompanied by jugglers, tumblers, and wrestlers. These two —the Swip and the gleeman — were professional persons, but thfj were not the oidy singers. Almost every one made verses or lang them. Heroes in the midst of battle sang as they idranaeci, like Harold Hardrada at Stamford Bridge ; Vikings, u they dntve their ships through the gale or stormed a town Bn tbfl river, shouted their hyinn of defiance to the sea, or their praisM of their ship, or the battle-stroke of the moment.

Poet, brought the miDds of those that hearil it back to the I Shaper of the universe, who hiiuifelf gave the art of song. Sara was Odiu's daughter among the Northmen. The view of ihe Greeks, of Houier, that the minstrel's iuapiration and invention were divinely given, was held by our English forefathers. We are told in Baeda's story of the poet Caedmon that all men held his gift to be divinely giveu liim of the Lord. Cyuewulf, as I have quoted above, says that \" God unlocked his breast and gave him back the power of song.\" In the Gnomic Verses this opinion is combined with the thought that the poet ia less troubled with selfish and tormenting thought than other men, because he has so many human things to think of. \"To all men,\" the versifier says, \" wise words are becoming ; a song to the gleemen and wisdom to men. As many as men ai-e on the earth, so many are their thoughts ; each to himself has a sepa- rate soul. So, then, he who knows many soii^ and can greet the harp with his hands, hath the less of vain longing, for he hath in himself his gift of joy which God gave to him.\" The jnyousness of the gift is expressed by many words. Song and music are almost synonymous with gleo and wynn and dream, with glee and delight and joy. The lay is in Beowulf the ficoJ- gamen. the rapture of the hall. The harp is the wood of social joy, the wood-beam of delight. Playing and singing are — \"to awake the joyous wood, the rapture of the harp, to rouse the happy lay,\" to practice the \"glee-craft,\" to have the \"jocund gift of poesy.\" Wisdom and prophecy are by other words connected with song ajid poetry. When we travel as far back as we can go with certainty — to the times when literary men in Rome discussed the Oer- mani'a, we find the Teutonic tribes harpists and singers of verse. \"They are a fair-haired folk,\" says Tacitus, \"blue- eyed, strongly built,\" and he tells of their love of song. \"They celebrate, in ancient lays, Tuisco, their earth-born god, (that ia, whom the Germans thought to have sprung out of the earth where they dwelt, so long was it since they had settled there), and Mannus his son, tJie forefathers and founders of their race.\" \"Their legends say that Hercules had been among them, and they call on his uame above all others in their war- songs when they march to battle,\" Other battle hymns were accompauied by the loud beating of the spears of the host against their shields, or by the roaring sound the warriors made when they laid their lips to the upper rim of the shield And hummed into it and over it. With this music they kindled themselves to battle, and according to its tone they foretold I WIDSITU, DEOR, AND THE 8c6p 11 tlic issue of the fight. In the AnnaU, we hear of the larger type of poetry, of the heginninga of the sagas. They have wngs, Tacitus writes, in honour of their deliverer Arminius ; • tiifre are other pieces also which they sing in their bivouacs ttd U their feasts. All this music and verse was, as we see, already old in the l bteof Tacitus, and belonged to religion and to war — a music I solemn ceremonies, sorrowful or festival \"Of all cere- ' mies, going into battle was the most religious,\" save perhaps ttit other great ceremony which was always attended by songs the burial of a king or herOj an instance of which we have the closing lines of Beowrdf. For 1900 years, then, we know that the English race has vfen a singing folk, and though we are not alone in that \"* racteristic, we are almost alone in this, that we possess in own language products of that singing temper in poems : those of Widsith and The Fight at Finnaburg wliioh may ^refrom the fifth to the seventh century. Moreover, there lays imbedded in the Beowulf which seem to go back to a ! more remote antiquity.

(Cotton Vitellius A. xv.) was one of those collected by Sir Koberl Cotton. It was in Little Deans Yard, Westminster, when the fire which, in 1731, destroyed bo many manuscripts took place, and was fortunately among those which were not fatally injured. In 17d3, having spent some time in the old dormitory at Westminster, it was transferred to the British Museum. In 1705 Wanley, employed by Hickes, the Anglo^axon scholar, to make a catalogue of the old northern books in the kingdom, discovered the poem of Beowulf in the Cottonion library and calls it a tractalus nfitiiligsimim poetici acriplus. It is a parchment codex, and the handwriting of the two copyists is of the beginning of the tenth century. Thorkelin, a Danish scholar, had two copies of it ni;ide in 1786, and published the whole of it for -the lirst time iii 181.5. This etiition made the poem known, and it was discussed in English and foreign reviews. Meantime, in 1805, Sharon Turner gave the first account of the poem iu his history of the Anglo-Saxons. Turner again, in 1823, and Conybeare, in 1826, filled up that account aud translated portioua of Bfowvlf into English verse, and in 1833 and 1837 John M. Kemble edited, with historical prefaces, and translated the whole of the poem, This schol- arly book increased the interest of foreign scholars in the noem; and, since then, a great number of editions and trans- lations have been published, while the essays, dissertations, articles, aud notices on the poem and the subjects contained in it, fill a long list, and are written by English, French, German, i Dutch, Danish, and American scholars. The poem, consisting of 3183 lines, is divided into two parts - an interval of fifty years, the first containing Beowulfs \\ pritdteds against the monster Grendel and his dam, the sec- MidBmnulTs conquest of the PiTe-drake and his death and bimai. The first dii-ision may be again divided into two — Hie %bt with Grendel, and the fight with Grendel's mother —Mid some suppose that they are due to different hantb. Beveral episodes are introduced which are linked on, often niy roughly, to the history of Beowulf, and two or threa of ^ete se«m to be taken from other sagas of even an earlier iXn than the original lays of the legend. The same kind of controversy which has raged over the com- petition of the Tliad and Ody»»ey has raged dso over Jkowutf. It i» said that it is a single poem composed by one man; and, on the contrary, that it is a poem built up, in process of time, hj fariouB hands, and consisting of various lays of different tffs; !uid this opinion, to take one instance, has been worked \"\"\" HOltenbof with a minuteness which makes the most demauds upon our credulity- We are to conceive first Iw old lays by different authors, then of a continuation of of tbe«e, and then of an introduction to the whole by two ttauthors^ The fifth — a reviser — added another portion dtered the prt!%-ious work to suit his addition, and another iwr, the sixth in the series, increased the poem by episodes other sagas and by Christian interpolations. Elaborate vmtnts of this kind are as doubtful as they are interest- The main point, however, seems clear. Beotculf was l)t up out of many legends which in time coalesced into Betliing of a whole, or were, as I think, composed together ^ajwem by one poet. The legends were sung in tlie Old iglaiid across tlie seas, and brought to our England by the igles, or by that band of Jutes or Saxons whom many sup- It to have settled, at an early time, in northern Northum- >*■ They were then sung in Northumbria, added to by Nor- ■obrian singers, and afterwards, when Christianity was still Wig, compressed and made into el poem by a Christian singer. The first question we have to aak is with regard to the date 1>e Btory. Is it entirely mythical and legendary, or is there TWtual history c^ontained in it which will enable us to date composition ? Such a connection with known history has a suggested. The Hygelac of the poem, Beowulf's lord, has a identified with the King Chochilaicus, who is mentioned *tie Binloria Franconim of Gregory of Tours, and in another Wnicle — the Gesta Regum Franconim. About 612-520, when the conquest of Britain had hot begun, tiie Tiotory of the Britons at Mount Badon caused a long paiise in the advance of the English, we are told that Chochila- icua made an expedition from the modem Gotaland to the Attu- arii of the Frisian shore — the Het^ai-e of the poem — to plun- der and to slay. When he was aBout to leave, having laden his ships with slaves and spoil, the Frankish king Theodoric sent his son to attack him with an army of Franks ajid Frisians. In the battle Chochilaicus fell and all the booty was recovered. This affair is four times mentioned in the poem of Beoimtlf, if we identify Hygelac with Chochilaicus, We are told that fate carried away Hygelac in feud against the Frisians. He fell under bis shield. His life and the jewelled collar he had from Beowulf passed into the power of the Franks. Beowulf himself, before he goes down to fight with the dra^n, tells of this fight; how Hygelac fell, bow he avenged his lord's death. Two . other allusions are made in the poem to the same expedition \\ and battle. It is said, therefore, that it must have been after ' the date of 520 that the main story of the poem arose. Of that there can be no doubt, but wb have also to remember that parts of the poem are drawn from lays older than r>20; lays, some of which, as the preface about Scyld, may go back to a remote antiquity. But the poem itself carries us past the death of Hygelac in 520 to Beowulf's death in 670. Only after that date, then, could the last part — the tight with the Dragon — begin to be welded to the first part of the story, and this would take at least thirty years to accomplish. This would bring us to the year 600. If we take that date, and if we make the poem Northumbrian, this first interweaving of the lays would be made about the time of ^thelfrith, before Northumbria had become Christian.' The second question to ask is. Where is the scene of the pofint-laid? It has been supposed by some, who hold that it was composed from end to end in England, that the scenery is English, and Mr. Haigh has ingeniously endeavoured to identify its descriptions with places on the coast of Yorkshire. But there is not one word about our England in the poem, not a single hint that the original singers knew of the existence of such a people as the English in Britain. The personals, the ' This areunieat is based on t!ie Buppositioii that Boowulf was, at least parti;, in hlstarliAl personage. But tlie niLupositlan is a cloubtlul one, aii<I we can ana lo no certainty with regard to the datu ul tbe story.

The Daueal dwelt in Seeland, and their chief town was there; the Geats ial Scandinavia, in Gotaland, and tbeir king's town was on the I west coast near the mouth of the Gotaelf. The name Wederas J and Wpder-Geatas suggested to Grein a connection with tli« | Island Vwleroe or Veiroe, and with the group of islands Vade- I t tmne.

But Etttir manners and their customs were the same as those of the Angles.

Kfany more, no doubt, crept in, but those that remain ara tliose which Time has selected. The luys in this condition were developed in our England and continued to be sung, even after the introduction of Christianity, in their aneient pagan iSbape, The warriors in hall were not likely to ask for any iChristianising of these songs. Lastly, some poet, with much Sympathy for heathen sagas and with as much Christianity as belonged to a man of the world, took all the lays, recast them in his own mind, formed them into a whole, embodied the episodes out of other sagas, conceived the character of Beowulf afresh, and with an ethical purpose, made it the central motive of the whole, and wrote the poem, for the most part, as it is. This is different from saying, as so many do, that it was a fortuitous congeries of lays ; but, at the sama time, it asserts — and it is necessary to assert this — that there ■were separate Beowulf lays existing, of different ages, long before this continuous poem was composed by a single poet -with a single aim. He used these lays, and sometimes, it seems to me, inserted their very words. Existing thus in Northumbria from the beginning, as I think, of the eighth century, it pEissed -fchrough England, and I imagine that now and again slight additions were made to it by those who wished to Christianise it more than the original writer had done. To such persons, vre owe, it may be, the homiletic parts of the poem. The final fortune that befell it was its translation into the Wessex dialect, and it is in that dialect that we possess it. The last thing to say with regard to these questions of date, origin, and place is that we may fairly claim the [loem as Eng- lish.

In its pages are our folk, their ways of life and fashion of thought; and not only ours, bat those of all North Teutonic folk from the end of tiii fifth century to the end of the seventh, to the pnd, I daresay, of 1/ the eighth. Any record of the manners and ciistoms of the TeJ- tonic peoples of those centuries is of great historical value. We have in the ancient Teutonic laws hints which throw light upon the habits of that time ; but we have little that vividly represents the daily life of the North Teutonic peoples. It ia this very want which is supplied by Beowvif. That tale gives ua a picture of human life at this early time — let ns say from the sixth to the eighth century — full of detail, painted in colours fresh and vivid, in which we see the works of war and peace, the king's ball, the harbour and the coast, the ships a-sai)ing, the life of the rovers, the settled town, the moorland round it, the hunt, the feast, the relations of the chief to his tbegns and to his i>eople, the customs of the court, of land and of gifts, the position of women, the burial of great personages. Behind the wars and tribal wanderings, behind the contentions of the great, we watch iu this poem the steady, continuous Ufa of home, the passions and thoughts of men, the way they talked and moved and sang and drank and lived and loved among ons another and for one another. This is the value of Beowulf as history, and it is of especial worth to us. It is a record of the way our forefathers lived both ou the continent and in our owa .__ country, and the record ought to be of surpassing interest. There are other matters of interest which belong to the poem, matters religious, mythical, and literary, but they will be better discussed in another place. At present only one thing mora remains before we come to the poem itself. It is to colleob out of it the early history of its hero, and to bring tliat history up to the point at which the poem begins. There are materials enough for this work. Many allusions are made to the hero's youth. He gives an account ©f his early years in his deaths 80ng. His dearest comrade, Wiglaf, Bjwaks of liis early wara. To collect all these scattered hints into one continuous sto^ will make the whole poem clearer, and will enable me to sketco- the character of Beownilf as he appears in youth and manhood- It ia the English ideal of a hero as it waa conceived by an Eng-— lisbman some twelve hundred years ago. Among the thegns who served Hrethel. King of the Geats^ £i^Uieow, of tha family of the Waegmundings, a wi«^ | ^ J fed e BEowrxr 'A: bid great warrior; and Hretliel, seeing his provess, gave him Lis (inJy daughter to wife, and of these two came Beowulf wlioiu his grandfather loved, for he left to him a famous coat of mail that Weland the great forg«man had smithied. Now Hrethel had three sons, Hereheald, Haethevn, and Hygelac, Md titese were uncles of Beowulf. The first two periahed bpfore the action of the poem opens, and only Hygelae was ]«ft alive to l>e King of the Geats. Hygelac had a daughter wbo ifl scarcely in the story, and, l)y his second (?) wife Hygd AMD called Heardred, Beowulfs cousin. Not one of these is li-ft alive at the conclusion of the poem. On his mother's side ftll Beownirs kindred are gone. On his father's side, that is among the Waegmundings, none stf ipft bnt Wiglaf, son of Weohstan ; the last thus of all the lii-ro's raee, for Beowulf died c-hildleas. This fewness of kinilred, this solitariness, is one of the pathetic points of the yUL Beowulf speaks of it again and again ; to Hrothgar, <u Hygelac. to others ; and it is the last of his thoughts when lip is dring. Tliis, as well as his immense strength, isolates I tbn hero, and the inward pathos of it — always great to a I Korthman — gave him, it may be, some of that gentleness for I »liich, among a violent race, he is celebrated in the saga. K, Miblness aud more than mortal daring meet in him, and the ■ BtliiiiBss, even more than the daring, separates his tiguie from ■ (be rest. H B(^«ow, his father, had in bis younger days great praise Knunig tiie coasts and isles for the mighty tigiit he Iiail with ^^'fiuUiolaf, a Wylting, whom he slew ^-ith his own hand. ^^%ira he took to roaming the seas and reached in his roaming ^■w court of Hrothgar, King of the Scylding Danes, when ^^Rntbgar was still young, and he became the king's man. ^^nr Urotligar healed, for his sake, Ecgtheow's feiid with the ^HPfrlGngs, standing old-time treasures to them over the water's ^■«ge. Afti^rwards, Ecgtheow went back to the land of the ^^ Gutg, lakiiig with him his son Beowulf, who seems to have ^m B*^ kuflwn, perha]>s bom, at Hrothgar's court, and settled in ^Kffibauir, \"living many winters ere he died, and all the wise ^^pii brand wide on earth, remembered him.\" This wisdom ^Bv'iruiit to Benwijf. J'Thongh he is young when he comes ^^k Btothgar to conquer Grendel, it is of his counsel as ^^poch M of his strength that we hear, Wealhtheow, the ^^p^ begs him to be friendly Ju counsel to her sons. ^^vothgar says to him, \" thou hoklest thy fame with patience, ^^P^ tliy might with prudence of mind. Thou shalt be a I r 20 EARLY ENGLISH LITERATTRE CHip. comfort to tliy people and a help to heroes.\" When he gives an account of the patobed-up truce between the Danes and the Heathobeaids, bis political vision of the end shows hoT clear and esperieiiced was his judgment of human nature. When Hygelac his lord is d«ad, Hygd the queen bega him to rule the kingdom because its foes were many, and none could order matters more wisely than he. When he is dying, he looks back on his life, and that which he thinks of the most, is not his great war-deeds, but bis patience, bis prudence, hia power of holding his own well, and of avoiding new enmities. Nowhere ia this temper better shown than in the words he speaks to Hrothgar when the king bursts out into an old man's passionate sorrow for the death of j^achere, his dearest tbegn — \"Sorrow not, wise man,\" says Beowulf, \"it ia better that a man should avenge hia friend than mourn him over- much. Each of us niuat await the close of life. Let biin who can, gain honour before be die. That is best for a warrior, when he ia dead, liut do thou, throughout this day, have patience of thy woes ; I look for that from thee.\" Gentle like Nelson, he had Nelson's iron resoluteness. What he undertook to do, he went through without a thought save of getting to the end of it. His very words when he spoke matie those who heard him conscious of bis firm-set purpose (line 611). \" Finn-minded Prince\" is one of his names. The heights bis character gained he was able to keep ; and a similar phrase to that is twice used of the hero. Fear is wholly unknown to him, and be seems, like Nelson, to hare inspired his captains with his own courage. It is a notable touch that when his thegns go to bed in the ball that Grendel haunts, it is said of them \" that none of tbom thought that he should ever again seek his well-loved home, the folk in the freo burg where he was brought up \" — and with tbia thought they all fell asleep. It is a trait worthy of the crew of the Victory- But his gentleness did not keep him back from fierce self- defence. When Hunferth accused him of being beaten in hi» match with Breca, his answer is full of scorn, of mocking, onA of savage retort. \" Drunken with beer, my friend, hast thoix spoken of Breca — thou who wast thine own brother's mnr^ derer. Grondel, the grisly monster, had never wrought «0 many ills for thy king, nor such a shame in Heorot, had thy courage been as fierce aa tbou claimest ! '' Yet afterwards^ when Hunferth, aober, lends him the old-world sword, Hrunt- ing, he forgets his wrjth and a-sks, if he die in his fight witl* • 6t«udel'a ntotbei, that Hunferth may have one of his ov9 BEOWUXf irds. This swift wrath, foi^tfulness, and generosil^, are^ of Nelson's chanicttT. The boastfulness was not. Beowulf always boasts before a battle of what he has done and will do against the foe. When he is going to die he ainga a death-lay o! his own glories. This, of which in some writer I have seen is the fashion of the Northmen. Every Icelandic stoiy Sail of it, and all who hear Beowulf boast are as much as the above writer is displeased. lOr was he less prompt in the blood-feud than in speech, the vengeance was not private or hasty. It is sjiecially of him that he did not, like some others, \" kill his iken hearth -com I anions ; nor was hia mind cruel.\" So his seuae of honour, of which he was so jealous, was not twld in a nice readiness to take personal offence, but in abso- lute truthfulness — \"1 swore no false oaths,\" he said when il}ing. So also he kept hie honoar in faithfulness to his lord ^ — \"on foot, alone in front, while life lasted, he was his king's Hdefeoce.\" He kept it in an equal faithfuluess when his lord ^Rn dead, and that to his oivn loss ; for when Hygd offered him ^nttt kingdom he refused ; and trained Heardred, Hygelac's sou, I \"lo war and learning; guarded him kindly with honour,\" and avTDged him when he was slain. He kept it in generosity, for iie gave away all the gifts he received; in courtesy, for he pre gifts even to those who had been rude to him, and he is *l*ayB gentle and grave with women. Above all, he kept it flMii in war, for these things are- said of him — \" So shall a niiui do when he thinks to gain praise that shall never end. and flits not for his life in battle.'' \" Let us have fame or death ! \" lie eriea ; and when Wiglaf comes to help him against the 'I'lgon, and Beowulf is wrapt in the flame, Wiglaf recalls to liioi the aim of his whole life. \" Ueowulf beloved, bear thyself 'pIL Tliovi wert wont to say in youth that thou wonldst never Irt Honour go. Now, strong in deeds, ward thy life, firm- *^ed I'rince, with all thy might ; I wQl be thy helper.\" ^ Theto are the qualities of the man and the hero, and I have J Ibftuglit it worth while to dwell on them because they repre- I l^ut the ancient English ideal, the manhood which pleased the English folk even before they came to Britain ; and because, in \"^ wit history siuce Beowulf's time, for 1200 years or so, they lii»eWn repeated in the lives of the English warriors by land ^ wa whom we chiefly honour.

To deepen this, came the Teutonic doctrine of the fate-goddess Wyrd, whose hand ar- ranged the destinies of men, and had settled their death-day. The name of the goddess passed to the thing she ordained, and in the later interpoLitiona of the poem the word is used in this sense, as well as in the sense of a personal Being. We hear of Wyrd herself, and we hear of the Weirds of men. The doctrine naturally acted differently on different types of men, and the poet makes it act with distinction on Beowulf himself. It settles his courage with firmness in the midst of desperate adventure. \" ' Wyrd ' goes ever as it must,\" he says, when he thinks he may be torn by Grendel to pieces. \" It shall be,\" he cries, when he goes to fight the dragon, \" for ua in the tight >j, as Wyrd shall foresee.\" Yet hia position is not that of pure , Fatalism. The goddess may save a man if only his courage keeps his might at full strength in the battle. \" Wyrd often preserves a hero from death if his power is at its best. Nor yet was I fated,\" he says to Hygelac when he describes Mb fight with Grendel's mother. While this sense of a fixed fata made him resolute to put into battle all his strength, it also established in him, combined as it was with his gentleness and tenderness, that grave melan«holy of life so charaeteristic of the Northmen. However men fought and endured, Wyrd had doomed them. This appears all through the poem, and Beo- wulf s last words are, \"Wyrd carried away all my kinsmen a^ the fated time.\" It was, then, not only the mighty aspect of the man, with his thirty-fold strength, but it was also the grave conception he had of life written on his face, which made the warden of the coast, and Wutfgar, when they beheld him, say, \" Sever saw I greater earl, nor one of a more matchless air.\" With thia went also the passion for new life, for movement, which Tenuyson has d^wn in Ulysses, but which is far more English tlian Greek; the inability to remain at ease, the longing \",to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield,\" which has always been the mark of English seamen.

He ia the builder of Heorot, the hall where Beowulf contends with tirendeL Hrothgar ia the second son of Healfdene, who is the son of another Beowulf than the hero of the poem; and this othei lieowulf is the son of Scjld, from whom the dynasty of the Scyldinga takes its name. In ancient days, so ran the legend, Scyld, when he was but a child, was drifted in an open b<mt to the shores of the Danes. When coming thus out of the seont of the sea the bark touched the land, the folk found the naked child lying asleep in the miclst of arms and gems and golden treasure, and took him up and hailed him king. With as many treasures as he brought, with so many they sent him awaj when be died. As he came alone and mysteriously out of the sea, so he passes away alone and mysteriously int<j the sen, and the intro- i duction to the poem describes his burial. It is the burial of a | hero who had passed into a divine being, but it ia also tliA 1 burial of a great sea-king, the earliest record by some hundred years — for the introduction is probably from an ancient song ' about Scyld — of many burials of the same kind among the northern lords ; but touched with so jioetic a hand that it is first of all accounts in art as it is first in time.

It is a litter heathen belief that the souls pass over an unknown Water to the realms beyond, and it may be that tills belief was one of the reasons why the Northmen sometimes buried their 'kaA in boats, so that when they came to this great se^ they might have carriage. Odinn, in after-myth, receives those who ate buried like Scyld. Wlien Sigmund bears SinfiiitU to the s^-aabore, he lays him iti a skiff which a, gray-mantled pilot hrings to the beaeh. This is Odinn, and he sails .away with the Imily. Balder himself, whose myth is later than this of Scyld, ia buried in a great ship. The gods place his body on a pyre in the midst of the bark ; it is set on fire, and pushed into the Bea,' Even a living man, in later times, buried himself in the \"ay of Scyld. Flosi, in the Njal saga, weary of life, puts out t<> sea in a boat that all men called un.seaworthy. \" 'Tis good enough,\" he said, \" for a death-doomed man.\" Of him, too, it ■oi^t be said, \" none of men could tell who took up that Mug,\" Aa the poem begins with this burial, so it ends with the iiorial of Beowulf. His burial has nothing mythic, nothing \"lystic surrounding it. It might be that of an historical per- sonage; and the contrast between the sbore-burial and the ' la the Yngllnga Saga, the burial nt Hafcl is ne&rer to that of Scyld.

Beowulf, dead after his tight with the dragon, and his gray hair lying round his head, is borne to the top of the great cliff that overlooks the sea, to the very edge, where the wanderers on the sea may hereafter mark his lofty barrow. The cliff has its own name. Men saw from its height the whales tumbling in the waves, and called it Whale's Ness ( Hrones-naes) . There then the folk of the Geats made ready a funeral pyre, firm-fixed on the earth, and they hung it with helms and with shields of the war-host, with shining shirts of battle, as the hero had asked of them — In the midst thereof the inighty-Iamous ting, Their belovM lord, mourning, laid the weutIoib.

This was the burning ; after the burning the barrow is raised ; and it shall be told at the eud how the people of the Weders built up on the point of the Ness a mouiid, high and bvoad, to be seen from far by the sailors whom ISeowuU loved. There is yet another burial told of in the poem. The bard at Hrothgar's table sings of the death of Huaef, kinsman of Hildeburh (perhaps her brother), and of tlie burning of Hildeburh's son on the same pyre as Hnaef. \"The blood- stained battle-sark, the gold«n helm, the boar crest, iron-hard, were piled on the wood ; and, with the two chieftains, many another ^theling who had fallen, writhing on the field of slaughter.\" Then beside the pyre of Hnetef Hildeburh bade Lay her well-beloved son all along the blazin); flnme.

' This is an inlaod burial, but the other two are by the sea; ind the sea-note struck thus at the beginning and close of the /poem is heard constantly sounding through its verse. The I men are sea-folk. Beowulf in his youth is a sea-rover, a fighter with sea-monsters, a mighty swimmer of the sea. All the action is laid on the sea^coast. The inland country, not the se^ is the unknown, the terrible. Grendel and his dam are more sea^emons than demons of the moor. Their cave is underneath the sea. Nor in the lost part of the poem are we without the all-prevailing presence of the ocean. The dragon lives in a cavern on the edge of the sea. The king and the dragon fight in the hearing of the waves. Beowulf's barrow, heaped high on the edge of the searness, is a beacon for \"those who sail through the mists of the sea.\" The back- ground of all the action is the great deep — the chorus, as it were, of this story of the fates of men. Thus the ocean life, the ocean mystery, the battle with the ocean and on the ocean begin the English poetry, and they are as vivid in it now as they were in the youth of our people. The Battle of the Baltic, the Fight of the Revenge, the Saihr Boy, Hervi Biei, Swinburne's sea-«ongs, a hundred ballads, taste of the same brine and foam which the winds drove in the faces of the men who wrote Beowulf, the Seafarer, and the liiddlea which concern the sea. Nay, more, the very temper of mind which pervades modem poetry of the sea — a mingling of melancholy and exaltation — is to be found in English poetry I before tlie Conquest, and strange to say it is not found again, except in scattered ballads, till we reach our own century. The action of the poem now begins with the voyage of Beo- widf to the Danish coast. The hero has heard that Hrothgar, the chief of the Danes, is tormented by Grendel, a man-devour- ing monster. If Hrothgar'a warriors sleep in Heorot — the great hall he has built — they are seized, torn to pieces, and devoured. \" I will deliver the king,\" thought Beownlf, when he heard the tale from roving seamen. \" Over the swan-road I will seek Hrothgar; he has need of men.\" His comrades urged him to the adventure, and fifteen of them were willing to tight it out with him. Among the rest was a sea-crafty man who knew the ocean-paths. Their ship lay drawn up on the beach, under the high cliff. Then There the well-genred heroes Stepped upan Che stem, while the sLream of ocean I so EAHLY ESGUSa LITERATURE Whirled the aea ajfaiiist the sand. To the ship, to it Bright and carv&d things of cost ca^rrieU then the ben>ea, And the armour well-arrayed. So the men outpuahed, On desired adventure, their tight ocean-woud. SwiElly weut abuve the waves with a wind well'fltted, Likest to a fowl, the Floater, foam around its neck, Till about the same time, on the second day, The up'CnrvfeJ prow had come on so far, That al la«t the seamen saw t^e land ahead ; Shining sea-ciiffa, soaring hpadlaiids. Brorul sea-nesaes. So the Sailer ot the Sea > Reached the sea-way's end. Beoaidf, 1. This was the voyage, ending in a fiord with two high i capes at its entrance. The same kind of scenery belongs to the laud whence they set out Wlien Beowulf returns over the sea the boat groans as it is pushed forth. It is heavily laden ; the hollow, under the single mast with the single sail, holds eight horses, swords and treasure and rich armours. The sail is hoisted, the wind drives the foam-throated bark over the waves, until they see the Geats' cliffs — the well-known sea- nesses. The keel is pressed up by the wind on the sand, and the \" harbour^ard, who had looked forth afar o'er the sea with longing for their return\" — one of the many huni&Q touches of the poem — \"fastens the wide-bosomed ship with anchoring chains to the strand, leat the violence of the waves should sweep away the winsome boat\" I have brought the two voyages together that we may see the customs of embarking and disembarking twice over, and realise the kind of sea and coast the shipmen of the poem sailed by — brief stretches of sea, between short bays pro- tected on either side by capes rising from the mainland till they became cliffs above the open aea. At the end of the bay into which Beowulf sails is a low shore, on which he drives his ship, stem on. Planks are pushed out on either side of the prow ; the Weder folk slipped down on the shore, tied up their sea-wood; their battle-aarks clanged on them as they moved. Then they thanked the gods that the wave-paths bad been easy to them. The scene which follows is almost Homeric in its directness and simplicity, and in the clearness with which it is presented. On the ridge of the hill above the landing-place the ward of the coast of the Scyldings sat on his horse, and saw the strangers bear their bright shields over the bulwarks of the ship to the idoithaaafcTray.\" | He rode down, wondering, to the sea, and eliook btiglitilj ill Lis hands his hea^y spear, and called to the men — Wta are ye of men having arms in hand, Covered with joui coats of mail who your keel afoaming O'er Ihe ocean itreet thus have orged along, Uillier on the high sea Never raw I greater Earl npoR this earth than is one o{ jou ; Hero In his harness.

Beowulf replies that he is Hrothgar'a friend, and comes to fw him from \"Grendel, the secret foe on the dark nights.\" Ke pities Hrothiiar, old and good. Yet, as he speaks, the Teulonic seuae of the inevitable Wyrd passes hy in his mind, Md lie knows not if Hrothgar can ever escape sorrow. \" If \"■^f.\" he says, \" sorrow should cease from hlin, release ever ';'i\"e,and the welter of care become cooler.\" The coast guard >ii\"ffathem the path, and promises to watch over their ship, llje ground rises from the shore, and they [lass on to the hilly ii'V- beliind which lies Heorot.

The deep blue water beyond spread out, '■^tween two rising nesaes, to the entrance of the fiord through ■jiiicli, ss through a gate, they saw the open sea. Only one hwt animated this landscape, the Coast^ward, sitting high on '*liorM, with his spear resting on his thigh. Below them, ^they look landward, about a mile away, the great hall, K*W)t, rose in the midst of a cultivated plain, which years of ■iliou: bad reclaimed from the moor and fen. On every side \"' it the wild land climbed slowly upwards, on one side ''j«aiiia the coast, on the other to the savage and uninliabited '\"'and country. Thi! hull was a rectangular, high-roofed, wooden building, 32 EARLY ENGLISH LrfERATUHE ch*P, its long sides facing north and south. The two gables, at either end, had stag-horns on their points, curving forw^ds, and these, as well as the ridge of the roof, were probably covered with shining metal, and glittered bravely in the aun. Round about it lay the village, scattered houses, each in its own garth, with apple-trees and beehives and outhouses. Out- side these was the corn-land, and the meadows on which sheep, oxen, and horses were grazing. Paths went in and out among the houses, and there was a wide meadow, like a village green, in the midst, between the hall and the houses of the hamlet, down which in the morniug walked the king and queen from the sleeping-chambers to the hall, attended by their young men and maidens. On the outskirts of the meadow, and out into the open, the young men rode, breathing their horses; and in a place apart, as poets love it, walked to and fro the bard, framing his songs for the evening feast The women sat spin- ning at their doors, or moved hither and thither, carrying water or attending to the cattle. This then was an island of tilled and house-built land at the edge of a wild waste of fen, but at a short distance from the sea. It is the image of a hundred settlements such as the Angles and Danes and Geats had built, and whence their young men ran out their ships to harry richer shores. When Beowulf and his men looked inland beyond the dwell- ings, they saw nothing but the great moorland where the wolf and the stag and the wild boar roamed at will. Pattihes of wood were scattered over it, and these grew thicker towards the horizon, where the whole moor lifted into low hills. Over it, in ceaseless movement, the gray mists rose and fell, and among them, as night drew down her helm, dreadful creatures seemed to stalk, and the loathsome light of their eyes burned through the mist like flame-' 'Iraayaa wpU. to illustrate this liescription, quote the pi , ,.. je from Alfred's OroafuBwhereOliIhereeriveaanacoouDt to the king of the scenery of thp North- men's coast. In his time there was, no doubt, in South Sweden and Jutland a wider [Hti|;e butweru the sea and the moor than that which Ohlhare give* to the upper const of Norway. But when Btowu!/ was first sung, it Is more than probable that the coasts of the Geats and Danes were sparse!* popuLiMd. At any rate this folio win); passage is interesting: \"Ohtbere said that ineoOHt o( the Northmen waa Tery long and very narrow. All that la fit either for pasture or plowing 'ies along the wn-roasl, which, however. Is in some parts very Hoddy. Along the enalem aide are wild moors, extending a long wa; Dp parallel to the I'ultivatert land. Thn Finlandersdwellin the moors.\" The dis- tance varies between the sea and the moors, but \" northward, where it is tof roweal. It may lie only three miles across, but the moors are In some parts so wide that a man could scarcely pass over them In two weeks, though In othet parts perhaps In ali days.\" — Ingram's traoslatlon of Ohthere'a account. Whea, turning from the inland, the men looked towania the aea, they saw that the coast was broken into short bavB aud headlajids, down to which the moor ran from the hills. Between each headland there was a narrow valley, hollowed out by descending streams, and each stream finally fell over a ledge of rock into the head of a bay. The slopes rising into the nesses were \" steep and stony,\"' and the trees tliat grew along the bed of the streams were rough aud blasted by the sea salt and the wind — \"a joyless wood.\" And among these fiords, at the head of a cavernous seargorge, there was close to Heorot a deadly place which they were afterwards to do with, of which a clear description is given in the test. It ia the dwelling- place of Grendel and his dam — \"tlie mickle mark-steppers who hold the moors \" — the sea^end of a \" hidden land, wolf- haunted, full of dangerous morasses.\" This was the scene they saw, but it was scarcely new to the men, for they daily looked on a similar landscape in their own land.
