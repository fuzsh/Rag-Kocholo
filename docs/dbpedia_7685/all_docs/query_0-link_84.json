        "text": "Probably one of the most anticipated topics about both the show and history is the actual relationship between Suleyman and his children, particularly Mustafa, and Mustafa’s relationship with his brothers. Why? - it’s the key between all the bloody events happening with all those kids.\n\nMy usual warning applies here with new power: there is no true version and there will never be, it is still unknown what was going on between all those guys and we can only judge and build assumptions on the events that took place. Nothing is real. Everything is a theory.\n\nIt is easy to slip from this topic to the eternal issue of credibility, which especially lacks in this fandom. For some reason, even all those 500 years later some supposed historians are still spitting blatantly false information out based on pure bias. Let me tell you a story.\n\nMustafa is the most controversial brother out there: was he the angel of the lifetime or a bloody satanist dreaming of slaughtering his father and the rest of his family for the throne? These debates became ridiculous ages ago, and based on them, I can tell you why nothing is ever reliable.\n\nA book tells us that in his childhood, Mustafa was a sadistic kid, torturing and murdering animals, being jealous of everything and his other brothers taking the spotlight away from him. In his palace, he secretly proclaimed himself a sultan and created his own mini Ottoman Empire, hating on everything and planning to overthrow Suleyman for good. The evil man got everything he deserved and the planet was freed from his toxic persona. Hurrem FTW.\n\nAnd mind you, this valuable information comes from a NOVEL. A novel about Hurrem and Suleyman’s relationship. This novel is literally a published hardcopy fanfiction that came out in Russia, filled with visible bias and author’s fantasies about her favorite Ottoman OTP. Why do people believe it? Because they want to use anything against the character they don’t like.\n\nSo, if we take this into account, of course any possibilities of Mustafa having a great relationship with his father and his siblings are out. You know what’s fun? Can you actually disprove that? You know one of many descriptions of Cihangir’s life states that because of his health condition and looks all his brothers were mocking him? Can you believe anything by this point?\n\nWhat I can state for sure is that our Selim did have what seems like a great relationship with his brother. First of all, it was him who built a tomb for Mustafa in 1573, when both his parents were long dead to disturb him. Many sources say it was also him who pulled out Mahidevran out of poverty, bought her a house and set her a pension. And most importantly, one of his many poems that I today dare to translate myself:\n\nOh the evil Fate, I scream of pain, you bring so much suffering, you yourself are pure pity… Nobody got happy from you, you didn’t bring joy to anybody… What have you done, this is a disaster and grief, you untrustworthy! Where is he, the greatest Şehzade - Sultan Mustafa?\n\nHere’s your source:\n\nIf that doesn’t tell us those two were good pals, I don’t know what else does.\n\nCan we assume the same with Bayezid? Maybe yes, maybe not, he didn’t leave any traces of any kind of relationship with Mustafa. The only thing was, he got the hint of being transferred to Amasya too literally, resulting in his death two years later. Mustafa was once here too, you know. We ain’t stupid, father. At least I think we aren’t.\n\nThere’s a great deal in the show about Mustafa and Mehmet, however. Funny enough, this bond was as non-existent as Bayezid’s. Technically, artsy Mehmet was considered Mustafa’s primary rival. We don’t know what the brothers themselves thought of this situation. It is interesting that the diwan itself - not European ambassadors - claimed that Mustafa will be sultan and Mehmet - his leading army general. You know…considering the existence of that law…that very one…doesn’t anything strike you as odd in this statement coming from the diwan? Were they so convinced Mustafa is such a good brother he wasn’t going to slaughter everybody the night he becomes a sultan? Does it tell us anything about Mehmet and Mustafa’s relations? Can we actually believe that statement in the first place? Of course their friendship would be a nice thing to happen, but ultimately we can’t just assume that it did take place. Just to be safe, people, just to be safe.\n\nBut more than ever, Mustafa and Cihangir are the pair that gets the most attention. I can make a guess and say it all started with the fact that both their deaths happened to be about a month apart. And then everything has begun…\n\nBefore the most popular version and the one I consider to be the most logical, there was a European play somewhere in the Medieval dedicated to Mustafa’s execution. In that play, Cihangir loved his brother so much that when he got the news about his death, he just committed straight up suicide. I’m not even joking, he killed himself, dramatically. In a country those religion treats suicide worse than any sin possible. Why did he kill himself? - because it was a play and everybody always loved watching some Turkish drama, on TV or in theatre, any century, any time.\n\nI think that Mustafa and Cihangir’s deaths only happen to be so close date-wise, which allowed all those theories to appear. The most popular one: both went to war with Suleyman, Mustafa got executed and poor Cihangir was so shocked by this and by war conditions that are not for his health he followed his brother shortly after. This was the most common theory, somewhere until spring 2014.\n\nSuddenly, we found out that Cihangir wasn’t even close to Turkey at that time, managing Haleb in Egypt. He even had a concubine, although hell knows how far could this relationship ever get with his state. One day he was just found dead. A very nice way to wrap up this statement, of course, but that’s how this version ends - he was found dead. In any case, it was a miracle Cihangir lived to 22 with his health problems in that day and age. It was only a matter of time from now one till he kicks the bucket. Anyhow, his service at Haleb seems to be a fact. So judging from that:\n\nIt takes one month to get from Istanbul to Amasya. It certainly takes damn ages to get anywhere from Haleb. To find out the execution news you should first recieve those execution news, and they are send with a real human being, on a horse. If they did die a month or so apart, the only hints Cihangir could’ve gotten about Mustafa’s death would be rumors. Do rumors travel faster than the news? Who knows\n\nAdd the big age gap between them: Mustafa was already in Manisa when Cihangir was born. The two grew seperately, plus Cihangir was a kid all this time. If they had time to socialise, I guess it wasn’t as intense as in the show.\n\nHowever, there are some adorable letters saved from real Cihangir-Mustafa correspondence. Brothers were texting each other in poems. Sometimes, Suleyman would join in. Seems like their relationship was nice then. In Suleyman-Mustafa’s case - until the news about his betrayal. And what was that thing all about is a completely different story.\n\nSo, some brothers were confirmed to be good friends, some just don’t have the proof. I wouldn’t dare dispute poems and letters, but everything else might be a lie and we will never find out the truth. The rest is up to your own interpretation."
