        "text": "What is Ottoman Empire ?\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was one of the greatest civilizations of its time. They made great conquests especially in Europe and Africa and maintained his dominance for years. I will write a detailed article about the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOf course, this great empire has produced great leaders like itself. Yildirim Bayezid, Yavuz Sultan Selim, Sultan IV. Murad, Suleiman the Magnificent and Mehmet the Conqueror.\n\nIn my opinion, Fatih Sultan Mehmet was the best among them and if he had not died at the age of 49, the innovations and reforms he would have created in the Ottoman Empire would have taken the Ottoman Empire to a different level.\n\nIt is known that Fatih, besides his reigning personality, also had a very intellectual personality. Fatih Sultan Mehmet was a person who read books in many different languages ​​and was curious about other cultures. Fatih Sultan Mehmet, who did very important works for the Ottoman Empire during his time on the throne, ascended to the Ottoman throne twice, the first in 1444–1446 and the second in 1451–1481, and ruled for a total of 32 years.\n\nChildhood and Education\n\nHe was born on March 30, 1432 in Edirne. His father was Sultan Murad II and his mother was Hüma Hatun. Şehzade Mehmed, whose education and upbringing were given great importance at a young age, received education from the most outstanding scholars of the period.\n\nMehmed II received his education from Molla Gürani, a disciplined and authoritarian special scholar appointed by his father, Sultan Murad II, due to his rebellious behavior in his education life at an early age.\n\nIt is known that Fatih has a personality that is extremely well educated, has a brilliant mind, is extremely determined and passionate about doing something, never gives up on his thought, can make harsh decisions when necessary, does not shy away from anyone, has big dreams and is ready for any difficulty in fulfilling these dreams, rarely laughs, stubborn in fulfilling his projects, assertive, daring and has the characteristics of a great statesman and leader. Sometimes he was quite calm, bland, gentle, kind-hearted, and forgiving.\n\nBesides Ottoman, he spoke Greek, Arabic, Latin, Persian and Hebrew perfectly. He was only 19 years old when he knew these languages.\n\nFirst Throne Period (1444 -1446)\n\nWhen Murad II returned to Edirne in October after defeating the Karaman Bey Ibrahim Bey in Anatolia in the summer of 1443, he received news that a Christian army led by János Hunyadi, the Hungarian King Ladislas, and the Serbian Despot George Brankovic had begun to invade the Ottoman lands south of the Danube. In the same period, news came from Amasya that Şehzade Ali had died. As a result of the early deaths of his two brothers, Mehmed became the heir to the throne.\n\nMurad had brought Mehmed from Manisa to Edirne during negotiations that began after the Christian army was stopped in İzladi on December 25. On June 12, 1444, a month after making a treaty with the Hungarians in Edirne, he left his son Mehmed as the “district governor” under the supervision of Grand Vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha in Edirne and went to Anatolia to march on the Karamanids occupying the Hamidili lands and made a deal with the Karamanids in Yenişehir. After leaving Yenişehir, in August he announced to the janissary lord Hızır Ağa and other beys in Mihaliç that he was officially withdrawing from the throne in favor of his son.\n\nMurad II’s abdication in the summer of 1444, thinking that he had achieved peace in the east and west, created a vacuum of authority in Edirne and dragged the state into depression.\n\nAt the same time, some states saw this situation as an opportunity. Venice, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Pope and Byzantium wanted to take advantage of the accession of the young sultan, who was only 12 years old.\n\nHowever, Murad II had not yet died and had only announced his retreat from the throne in favor of his son, and this meant that he could and did return.\n\nAt the invitation of Grand Vizier Halil Pasha, Murad II crossed to Rumelia from the point where the Anatolian Fortress was located and came to Edirne and on November 10, 1444, he inflicted a heavy defeat on the Christian army at Varna. Although Mehmed did not abdicate during and after the Battle of Varna, actually sultan was Murad II.\n\nI will not go into too much detail from this period until the death of Murad II. On February 3, 1451, II. After Murad’s death, Mehmed’s second throne period officially began.\n\nSecond Throne Period(1451–1481)\n\nMurad II died on 3 February 1451. Mehmed received the news of his father’s death with a letter sent to Manisa by Grand Vizier Halil Pasha with a special messenger. He reportedly said, “May the one who loves me come after me!” and jumped on his horse and headed north. Mehmed ascended the throne for the second time in Edirne on 19 February 1451.\n\nOn the other hand, both in the West and in Eastern Rome, the new sultan was not perceived as a significant threat at first due to his young age and inexperience. This view was reinforced in 1451 when Mehmed renewed his father’s treaties with Venice, the Genoese Republic, Hungary, and the Serbian Despotate.\n\nChristians were not the only ones who thought that Mehmed was an incompetent ruler. After his accession to the throne, the Karamanids rebelled to resurrect the local principalities and captured Seydişehir and Akşehir. In the summer of 1451, Mehmed moved to Anatolia and soon suppressed this rebellion.\n\nConstantinople / Istanbul Conquest\n\nIstanbul (or Constantinople as it was then known) was the capital and last stronghold of the ancient Eastern Roman Empire. The wide and majestic city walls of Istanbul undertook the task of protecting the city against enemy raids from land and sea. While the walls of Istanbul were two-storey on land, they were single-storeyed in the sea. It was known that the walls protecting this city were weaker on the sea shores. While Fatih Sultan Mehmet was staying in Amasya, his father hired him important teachers. The young Fatih, who developed himself from Amasya, had set his mind to take Istanbul there. In order to realize this aim, he started to work from the year he came to the throne (1451).\n\nAfter Fatih conquered Istanbul, he would make the city his capital. Therefore, he first sent a message to Emperor Constantine, telling him to hand over the city to him. Naturally, this request was not welcomed in Byzantium and was rejected by Constantine. Despite this, Fatih wanted to take the city by surrender, not using weapons. He made a great effort not to take over his future capital in ruins due to war. However, he could not reach a conclusion through diplomatic means. Emperor Constantine preferred to stand by his people and refused the surrender request sent by Fatih many times.\n\nThe Importance of Istanbul for the Ottoman Empire\n\nThe capital of the Ottoman Empire was Edirne at that time. Part of the territory of the state was in Anatolia and some of it was in Rumelia. Istanbul was in a very important position in such an order. During this period, Ottoman ships that crossed from Anatolia to Rumelia or from Rumelia to Anatolia were fired on by Venice and Byzantium, and therefore their security was threatened. For this reason, Fatih understood the importance of full control of the straits.\n\nHowever, Istanbul was in a position to control the Bosphorus opening to the Black Sea. Some states, especially Venice and Genoa, used the Bosphorus to reach the Black Sea and made agreements with the Eastern Roman Empire for this.\n\nIn addition, this conquest was of extra importance for Mehmet II; because his father was brought back immediately after his first accession to the throne, causing rumors and beliefs that he would be a weak sultan after his second accession to the throne. In order to silence these rumors and prove the expectation wrong, Mehmet II was planning an undisputed victory. Istanbul was the perfect fit for this. All these reasons aroused a desire for the conquest of Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire.\n\n-Preparations for Conquest\n\nRealizing that Istanbul had to be conquered by means of arms and that this was possible, Fatih started military preparations. Rumeli Fortress, which is still standing today, was started to be built by the order of Fatih. The fortress was built directly opposite the Anadolu Fortress, which was built during the Beyazıt period. The important purpose here was that during the Conquest, no aid could reach Byzantium by sea over the Black Sea. The Ottoman Empire established its dominance in the straits thanks to the effective power of these two Hisars.\n\nJust at this time, a Venetian ship passing through the Bosphorus without permission was hit and sunk by these two fortresses. This event shows the effective patronage power of the Ottoman Empire in the straits.\n\n-29 May: Final Attack\n\nIn the Ottoman camp, opinions about whether the siege would be successful and whether it should be lifted were in conflict with each other. The conflict between the two groups, who thought differently about the future of the siege, continued. In the war council, the two sides faced each other again. Despite all efforts, Halil Pasha and his supporters could not convince the other side to lift the Siege of Istanbul. Although the Byzantine Emperor was warned to surrender the city again, Emperor Constantine did not accept this offer.\n\nThe attack was made in the morning hours of May 29, before sunrise. The general belief is that the Ottoman soldiers entered the city through the breaches opened from the walls. Besides, there are also veterans climbing the walls. One way or another, the Ottoman army had attacked 4 times in total since the siege of Istanbul and was finally victorious on 29 May.\n\nAfter the city fell, Fatih entered the city to take control of the situation, as some clashes were still going on inside the city. Fatih, who entered the city, ordered the people not to be attacked and told the people to obey them. This order was answered by the people, and in a short time, calm prevailed in the city.\n\nAll sections of the people and the patriarch were gathered in Hagia Sophia. After Fatih entered Hagia Sophia, he saw the patriarch and the people, who cried and threw himself on the ground. He told them to shut up with a hand signal. Then he told the fallen patriarch to stand up and declared that he would not persecute the Christian subjects. He then told his soldiers not to harm the people and declared that he would immediately execute those who opposed this order.\n\nEstablishment of the New Capital\n\nImmediately after the conquest, Mehmed started the restoration of the city. His aim was not to destroy Eastern Rome, but to resurrect it within the Ottoman structure. Although the empire he would establish was an Islamic state, it would have a cosmopolitan structure like Eastern Rome.\n\nAfter the conquest of Istanbul, Fatih saw himself as the sole legal heir of the Roman Empire. For this reason, he will take care to make expeditions towards the West. After giving himself the title of Kayser-i Rum, he wanted to take Rome and Europe in general and he struggled in this direction. Fatih saw the Ottoman Empire as the “Third Roman Empire”."
