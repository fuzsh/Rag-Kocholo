        "text": "I sometimes feel like I’m in the minority in my thinking that nearly all the princes are well characterized or, at the very least, fulfill their thematic purpose. Now, is there a narrative outlining of their roles that often tends to point us to who should we root for or not? Yes, of course. It’s pretty clear who is favored by the writing and who holds the central focus. But is this that damaging to the characters of the princes? Well, for me they have way more depth than people I’ve encountered give them credit for, even like this.\n\nStill though, the one prince that deserved better from the writing and should’ve been explored more is definitely Mehmet. When it comes to sympathy, I like him fine - he’s a nice and well-meaning guy who is loyal to the people closest to him and his fate is nothing short of sad and tragic. I sympathize with his desire to go to a sanjack and gain experience there, this is the strongest piece of motivation we got from him. He certainly loves strongly, doesn’t think bad of anyone and isn’t yet ready for the dangers of the world around him, he’s vulnerable to them because he hasn’t gotten out of the castle for so long and everyone has been cool with him at the least. That also reveals a degree of passivity in him. He strongly values his father’s decisions and respects them even when he’s not okay with them (when he refuses to let him go to a sanjack) or when someone else isn’t (i.e. Mihrimah). He can stand up for himself at times, but caves to the will of his parents in the end anyway because of his dedication to them. But these characteristics are only set up, not properly delved into. He ends up being underused and undeveloped, gets almost no material on his own and what he does get isn’t fully about him except for his antics in Manisa at the end of the season, he’s just more often a background character than anything else. He’s pretty consistently characterized, but he’s more one-note compared to the other princes. Though I have to admit that retroactively we can see why SS favors him so much, albeit it being more “inside the lines”, because it’s a theme that gets more explored in S04 than in S03, and his fatal flaw is defined from the start, which is a nice touch, all things considered. He had potential with his dynamics, but we weren’t given enough even with his good interactions with Hürrem and Mihrimah that added flavor nonetheless. I spoke more about the problems I have with him here. (I came off as rather biased in that ask, but my thoughts stand. There I also linked my stance on SS’s relationship with him, because it’s both thematically interesting and Mehmet’s most fleshed out relationship.) I have to say I do like little Mehmet more, because he looked more active as a character (he’s the second most characterized little prince after Mustafa, along with little Cihangir as well.) in his childish wish to marry Aybige, in being next to Cihangir along with the others, in his little story with Mihrimah about the breaking of Hürrem’s crown where we could see both of their contrasting approaches to the problem, in him being glad for Mustafa going to the sanjack even there… Yes, it is also set-up and I may be overanalyzing it, but it was enough in that point of the show. Older Mehmet didn’t really get the chance to go beyond that set-up.\n\nI have a soft spot for Cihangir. Some think that his love for Mustafa is his entire character, but in my opinion, that’s further from the truth. He has a well-defined personality and arc: he’s bookish, he’s interested in art and is also shown to have political capability (him, Mustafa and Bayezid advising SS to go to Rome.). He’s the one who’s the least in the throne war, their moral compass, so to say, their only piece of innocence left (Selim and Bayezid even acknowledge it at some point), yet is very perceptive of his surroundings, the only one out there who has the chance to look at this fight as an outside observer, which is why he can see and understand all perspectives the way he does (as seen as his interactions with Hürrem and his speech about the fears to Mihrimah.). He doesn’t play an active part of the fight, he doesn’t intrigue or scheme, he doesn’t like such methods, but he still has an established side and scolds those he sees as wrong. He doesn’t stand by when someone does something he doesn’t agree with. He openly shares his views. His relation to his unfortunate condition is very interesting: he knows he’s loved and appreciated by those around him for who he is, but he’s understandably still upset that he can’t live life as every prince does. He’s aware of the cruelty of the battle for the throne, but he admits that even he dreams of the throne along with everyone else. He knows he can’t have what the others do, that it’s forever lost since birth and that scares him, but he still is so strongly attached to everyone in the family. Yes, Mustafa has a special place in his heart, but he cares about the rest. A lot. He understands his mother, despite of not approving some of her actions and even chose her rather than Mustafa in one instance. His love for Mihrimah and Bayezid is pretty clear by their interactions. Even when he’s seen scolding Selim more than anything, they have a very poignant moment that truly underscores how interesting their dynamic actually is. And Cihangir loves his father, leans on him. It was precisely the huge shock and disappointment of his father doing what he promised he never would that brought him to his heartbreaking end.\n\nCihangir had distinct enough characterization to leave place for nuanced dynamics and good scenarios for a condensed runtime. Only his side story for Huricihan didn’t do him much justice (then again, I have issues in everything about Huricihan, but that’s something else entirely.), although it showed his care for Bayezid, and I wish we saw even more of what I described, especially his dynamic with Selim. More happier moments would be nice and would flesh him out even more, with every prince being together and bringing something to a conversation, but it’s S04 we’re talking about… Little Cihangir is also such a cutie and a sweetheart and older Cihangir was a solid follow up. Overall, for a bit more than a half-season they did a good enough job, though again.. gimme more Cihi!!!\n\nMustafa is often viewed as a righteous hero stereotype, but this way his depth gets overlooked by some amount. He’s definitely his trope and the writers love to play it straight as often as they don’t so much, but he has a clear personality, motives and goals. I won’t say much about older Mustafa, because I talked about him in depth and why I think his characterization is great here. I love the way his biggest strength is his biggest flaw and he has enough material for his character to be explored. The most unique thing about him is definitely his relationships and the moments where he snaps or is close to snapping, because they are a nice contrast to how he usually is. Mustafa is a character that keeps his principles until the end and writing-wise, this is fascinating as much as it can create repetitive scenarios at times. My single problem with him is precisely this: Mustafa’s fatal flaw isn’t something he eventually develops; it’s something that’s always been inside him since E01 and that results in constant, almost formulaic plots ending in scolding and confrontations with his father again and again until the next one happens, which gives off the impression that Mustafa, as a character, is stagnant and never learns from his mistakes. It’s as if he does the same thing again and again, since the reason for him doing it remains the same. And it’s like it must remain the same, it cannot disappear, because it has to be utilized thematically- it’s what would ultimately lead him to his death. (that problem is present in Mehmet, too, but to a comparatively smaller extent, due to him being reduced to a background character.) Mustafa simply developed in other aspects, not in this one.\n\nTo be honest, Mustafa gets even more points because of his characterization when he was little. He indeed felt vibrant and alive, with so much personality and characterization right out of the starting gate. The way he missed his father’s presence, since he couldn’t see him as much as he once did in Manisa, the way he was sensitive to his mother’s suffering to the point he told her he didn’t want to make her cry ever again, the way he was willing to assert himself to get what he wanted, his childlike curiosity about the ongoing events, him playing with everyone.. He even had a bit of development: he didn’t want a brother at first, but eventually he loved and took care for his brothers like no other and that was built on with grown! Mustafa. Older Mustafa in general felt like a natural progression to little Mustafa and together they create a good character.\n\nSelim and Bayezid are intriguing to me. Their characterizations are as well handled as their conflict and we see why they do what they do. There’s quite a lot to unpack in Selim’s personality: he’s the true outcast of the family, the one everyone immediately writes off when it comes to the battle of the throne. He’s different than everyone else, he doesn’t partake in their happier conversations and that upsets him, no matter how much he tries to hide it until he can’t take it anymore. It doesn’t seem like it at first glance, but he cares a lot about what people think of him and strives to make a good impression, even if he doesn’t always succeed. His arc is about realizing and doing what it takes to win the game and we can see the way he accepts the reality he didn’t want to grapple with. He has awesome dynamics with everyone, but especially Nurbanu, Bayezid, Hürrem and Mihrimah. I’d argue that he’s the prince with the most development out of the five, since there actually is a condensed, yes, not 100% complete, yes, but linear change in personality. We can’t talk about Selim’s characterization without mentioning the narrative voice that supposedly presents him in a worse light that the others and that could make him look more shallow than he is, but I feel he had his fair share of sympathetic moments and his condition makes us root for him rather than decry him. His characterization goes along with his thematic purpose (presenting Süleiman’s S04 view of loyalty), much like the other princes, but it’s not in the level of existing just for the sake of that or as egregious to put him at a disadvantage. He is “shadier”, compared to the rest (but the same goes for Bayezid for me, tbh), but that makes him more interesting and three-dimensional. It makes him more human in a way. He does actions the narrative never condones and he isn’t presented as the best fit to the throne, but he has logical motives to go that far. He’s shown to do what he’s deridedly known for, yes, but that doesn’t define him. A crime he didn’t historically do is also added to his list and that may leave people with a bad impression of MC Selim and an attempt to vilify him further, but writing-wise? It was a fitting end of his arc. And his feelings over it are messy and conflicted long after the fact.\n\nI see more and more aspects of Bayezid while rewatching the show and they aren’t him being shown to be “good” and “right”, because of “bad” Selim and because he sides with Mustafa. Bayezid is brave, ambitious, a good fighter and has similar virtues to Mustafa and Cihangir, while at the same time he holds understandable, but destructive anger he lets out that makes him impulsive, stubborn and irrational. A lot of this comes from him never being favored by his father and his conflict with Selim which is caused due to insensitivity, ignorance and the attempts of both of them to prove themselves to their parents. Bayezid seemingly had the support of those around him and he himself knows his own capabilities, but deep down inside he still isn’t sure whether he’s supported 100% even by his mother who turned to Selim for a while. Bayezid can be playful and considerate (shown mostly in his debut scenes), was merciful, yet constantly provocative. He, along with Mustafa, had the most varied interactions: he has a huge dedication for Mustafa, he has a truly brotherly dynamic with Cihangir, he knows Mihrimah is the only one who would fully stand behind him, even in the end. He, similarly to Cihangir, loves his mother a lot, but doesn’t condone her actions. The same goes for Huricihan. He both knows where the line is, yet doesn’t. His arc was about realizing that he can’t act like Mustafa when he is at the verge of ending up like him, thus directly rebelling against Süleiman. Bayezid also changes throughout the narrative: he becomes more about survival the more we go and his flaw keeps getting more and more visible.\n\n[Now, little Selim and little Bayezid are more about foreshadowing of their future conflict than anything else except for a few moments in between. Their older counterparts are big improvements and I think there truly is a lot to appreciate in them.]"
