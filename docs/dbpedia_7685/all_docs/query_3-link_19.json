        "text": "Hürrem Sultan (1502-1558) also known as Alexandra , was the favorite concubine, chief consort and legal wife of Suleiman the Magnificent. She was the mother of five of his children: Şehzade Mehmed, Mihrimah Sultan, Şehzade Selim, Şehzade Bayezid and Şehzade Çihangir. In history, she was the first \"Haseki Sultan\" (chief consort of the Sultan.) In the series, Mahidevran Sultan was the first Haseki Sultan. She achieved power and influenced the politics of the Ottoman Empire through her husband, and played an active role in state affairs. In her reign, the people once believed that she was a witch, as she seduced Sultan Suleiman and was strong in politics.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nAlexandra was born in 1502 in Eastern Galicia, which at that time was a part of the Kingdom of Poland. She was the daughter of an Orthodox priest, and her native language was Ruthenian [Ukrainian]. In the 1520s Crimean Tartars captured her during one of their frequent raids into this region, took her as a slave (first selling her to the Crimean city of Kaffa, a major center of the slave trade, then to Istanbul), and she and her friend from her village, Maria, were sent to Sultan Suleiman's harem.\n\nBecoming Hürrem Sultan[]\n\nHürrem was a young woman who seduced Sultan Suleiman in order to gain power within the very harem she was abducted into. Eventually, she came to truly love Suleiman. Hürrem was possessive, brutal, cunning, territorial, and fierce. Merciless towards her enemies and unrelenting until victory, she bested every rival who threatened her relationship with Suleiman, as well as his safety. In the beginning, Alexandra is inconsolable, and deeply depressed. She wished to die in order to reunite with her dead family and former fiancé, believing him to have perished during the raid. However, Nigar Kalfa (one of the main Harem leaders) explains to Alexandra that all of them arrived as slaves, and if Alexandra behaves herself and does as she is told, she will be summoned by the Sultan. Should she win his heart, and give him a son, she will rule the world as a Sultan.\n\nThe next day, Hürrem, after considering Nigar's words, takes a drastic step to capture the attention of Sultan Suleiman. While he was walking past the girls of his harem, she suddenly cried out his name. Suleiman slowly turns towards her as the rest of the harem remains bowed, shocked by such boldness. He moves closer, teetering on the edge of anger, when Hurrem swoons. Suleiman catches her reflexively, and her eyes flutter open just long enough for their gazes to meet. \"Suleiman,\" she whispers, before once more appearing to faint. The young Sultan orders for her to be attended to. While Sümbül and Daya Hatun scramble to do his bidding, he is so distracted that he temporarily forgets where he is going before Ibrahim reminds him\n\nThe scheme is successful, and Suleiman is intrigued by her. The next evening, there is a celebration, organized by his mother the Valide Hafsa Sultan, in Sultan Suleiman's honor. Several concubines, including Alexandra and her friend Maria, are chosen to perform for him at the order of Ibrahim Ağa, the Sultan's concierge. Suleiman can't take his eyes off of Alexandra during the entirety of her seductive solo. When her solo ends, he throws to her the purple handkerchief which is an invitation to spend the night with him the next evening. However, when the moment arrives, Mahidevran Sultan (the mother of his first heir Şehzade Mustafa), fearing losing Suleiman's attention, suddenly enters Suleiman's chambers instead while Alexandra is sent back to the harem.\n\nThe following evening, Alexandra is summoned again to spend the night with the Sultan. While Nigar Kalfa is preparing her for her evening with the Sultan, she reminds Alexandra that Mahidevran Sultan is his Haseki Sultan (chief consort), and that he spends every Thursday night with her. The reason being that the night connecting Thursday and Friday is a sacred night in Islam, for if a child is conceived on that night, the child will be plentifully blessed. Hearing this, Alexandra is determined to spend not just this Wednesday night with him, but the next one as well. When Alexandra enters the Sultan's chamber, she faints in his arms once more. When she reawakens, Suleiman wants to summon a physician. Alexandra stops him, stating that her fainting spell is only because she has been so excited to spend the night with him. The two then have an enchanting night together, and spend all of Thursday together as well. This news devastates Mahidevran Sultan, who was readying herself Thursday evening for the Halvet (private chamber.)\n\nDuring their time together, they laugh gaily and play games. Suleiman is so delighted by Alexandra’s cheerful and playful personality, that he affectionately changes her name to \"Hürrem\", which means \"The cheerful one” or “The one who makes us smile.” Friday morning when Hürrem is returning to the harem, many of the concubines crowd her and beg for details of her extended time with the Sultan. Hürrem tells the other concubines that the Sultan has renamed her, and they must refer to her as \"Hürrem\" from now on. Sümbül Ağa (the head eunuch of the harem) and Daye Hatun (Chief treasurer and the Valide Sultan's companion) enter the harem. Sümbül Ağa brings the Sultan's decree that Hürrem is now one of his favorite concubines, and she now holds the title of \"Hatun\" (Lady.) He also announces that Sultan Suleiman has sent her gifts that only favorites receive, and she will now have a bedchamber in the favorite's wing of the harem, instead of sleeping with the other concubines on a cot on the floor. Sümbül hands her a chest containing precious jewelry, and a new dress. When Hürrem Hatun enters her new bedchamber, she is ecstatic and jumps around the room gaily, both amusing and annoying Nigar Kalfa. Later that evening, there is a gathering in the harem held by the Valide Sultan, and Hürrem descends the stairs in her new dress and jewels. Mahidevran Sultan, still upset about Hürrem spending Thursday night with the Sultan, and having got wind of Hürrem's dancing skills the evening of his celebration, decides to intimidate Hürrem into dancing for everyone present. The Valide Sultan herself is even curious to see. Unable to refuse the both of them, music begins to play, and Hürrem dances very well. Everyone in attendance watches in admiration, and Mahidevran Sultan, jealous and disgusted by this, commands her to stop. Though she knows that Hürrem Hatun has been renamed and made a favorite, she coldly congratulates her on her skills by calling her \"Alexandra\". Hürrem Hatun corrects her directly in front of the Harem, deeply offending the Haseki. The Valide Sultan sends Hürrem to the dungeons for her disrespect. The next day, Mahidevran visits Hürrem Hatun in the dungeon to gloat, and maintains that if she wishes to be freed, all she must do is kiss her dress hem and beg for forgiveness. Hürrem steadfastly refuses, claiming she has nothing to apologize for. Mahidevran then angrily commands the guards to starve her and deprive her of water, and leaves her in the dungeon. Days afterward, Suleiman summons Hürrem Hatun to his chambers, but he is informed by Sümbül Ağa that she was sent to the dungeons by the Valide Sultan. Furious at this news, he orders her immediate release. Weakened and ill from the lack of food and water, Sümbül Ağa carries a limp Hürrem back to her chamber. The Sultan storms into the harem and heads straight to the favorite's wing. The Sultan, upon seeing the truly poor state Hürrem is in, commands Nigar Kalfa and Sümbül Ağa to nurse her back to health. She spends the next while recuperating from her ordeal, while growing even closer to Suleiman. So close in fact, that the Sultan decides to gift her the coveted emerald and diamond ring he made himself that was originally thought to be for Mahidevran Sultan.\n\nHürrem Hatun leaves the private chamber, feeling triumphant that she was given the coveted ring, when she suddenly runs into the young Şehzade Mustafa, who is running on his own through the halls looking for his father. She tells him it's forbidden for him to go to his father's chambers alone, and grabs his hand to take him back to his mother. Mahidevran Sultan and her servant Gülşah see them walking towards them, and Mahidevran is instantly upset and demands Hürrem unhand her son. Mahidevran suddenly notices the emerald ring on Hürrem's finger, and becomes enraged at Hürrem's supposed theft of her ring. She tries to forcefully remove it, but Hürrem holds fast. She manages to escape, and as Mahidevran loudly accuses her of theft, the Haseki suddenly faints. It becomes evident that Mahidevran Sultan is pregnant, which pleases Valide Sultan, Hatice Sultan (the Valide's daughter and Sultan Suleiman's sister), and the Sultan himself. He comes to see her in her chambers, and brings her a beautiful necklace to show his gratitude and respect. However, Mahidevran is affronted that he gave Hürrem the emerald ring she wanted, and asks him how he could do that to her. Süleiman, offended and annoyed at her lack of gratitude, then tells her that it was his decision to make, and she needs to respect it. Mahidevran is burning with envy at the attention Hürrem is receiving, and is wallowing at the fact the Hürrem now wears the emerald ring. She and her maid Gülşah then conspire to steal it. Gülşah enlists the help of a reluctant Ayşe Hatun, one of the Sultan's favorites. When Hürrem and the other concubines are in the Hamam (the bathing room), she takes off her ring while she bathes. While she isn't looking, Ayşe Hatun takes Hürrem’s ring. Hürrem notices it’s disappearance, and furiously interrogates the other concubines. Nigar Kalfa walks in and breaks up the fighting. It is brought to the Valide Sultan’s attention, and she commands Daye Hatun to get to the bottom of the theft. The harem is in a small uproar as everyone starts searching for the ring, but no one can find it. Hürrem’s first instinct is that Mahidevran Sultan has it. As the ring continues to be missing, Hürrem subtly threatens Sümbül Ağa that if he doesn't find it, she will tell the His Majesty. Sümbül informs Ibrahim Paşa (formerly Ağa), who then begins questioning everyone. Ibrahim interrogates a suspicious Ayşe Hatun, and she reveals that GüIşah and Mahidevran Sultan put her up to it. Ibrahim tells her to keep her mouth shut. Ibrahim informs the Valide Sultan in private, and they come up with a plan to secretly get the ring back while protecting Mahidevran from the Sultan's wrath. Valide Sultan summons Mahidevran to her chambers under the guise of concern for her health, and the health of her unborn grandchild. Meanwhile Daye Hatun forces Gülşah to hand over the ring. The blame is then placed on an innocent concubine, but Hürrem knows the truth. The ring is returned to its owner. Later that evening, the Valide Sultan scolds Mahidevran Sultan for her foolish actions, and sternly reminds her that she is the Haseki Sultan so she should start acting like it, and end these foolish schemes. Mahidevran goes to her wardrobe, and sees the ring has been taken back. She weeps all night at her misfortune. In the morning she awakens to a pain in her belly, and notices blood on her bed. In horror, she realizes she had a miscarriage, and bellows in grief. After being seen by physicians, she stumbles in a trance towards the private chamber to tell Sultan Suleiman what happened. She notices Hürrem leaving the private chamber herself. Unstable from her grief and pain, Mahidevran assaults Hürrem viciously. Erroneously blaming Hürrem for her miscarriage as Mahidevran believes it was caused by her deep sorrow at Suleiman’s attention for Hürrem. Gülşah finds the two in the corridor, and drags Mahidevran Sultan away before anyone can see what she’s done. Daye Hatun and Sümbül Ağa find Hürrem unconscious on the floor, bruised and bloodied from Mahidevran’s attack. They quickly get her to her chamber before anyone notices, and begin to treat her wounds. Hürrem regains consciousness, and walks over to the mirror to see her reflection. Her face is badly swollen, bruised, and scarred. She sobs in despair at her condition believing Suleiman will never love her or touch her again, while Daye and Sümbül try to keep her calm and quiet. Meanwhile, when Daye finds out that Mahidevran has had a miscarriage, she runs to tell the Valide the news. Hatice Sultan is sitting in her mother’s chambers, daydreaming about her secret love, Ibrahim Paşa, when Daye Hatun bursts into the room with news of not only Mahidevran’s miscarriage, but of her brutal assault of Hürrem Hatun. Hatice Sultan attempts to console Mahidevran’s loss when the Valide Sultan enters, and asks Hatice Sultan to go tend to Şehzade Mustafa. Bewildered and frustrated with Mahidevran’s reckless behavior, she berates her for her actions. Mahidevran lies and say that Hürrem provoked her, and spoke badly of the dynasty. That evening, Sultan Suleiman summons Hürrem to come to his chambers, but she refuses because she is ashamed of her damaged face. Suleiman storms into her chamber demanding an explanation, but stops cold when he sees her face. Shocked at her painful appearance, he gently comforts her and asks her who did this to her. Hürrem tearfully tells him it was Mahidevran Sultan. Enraged, he storms into Mahidevran's chambers to confront her for her actions, and heatedly denounces her. He then leaves her alone in her chamber while she sobs in despair at her losses. He then takes Hürrem to his chambers, and tends to her wounds himself. Suleiman tells his mother that he wants Mahidevran out of his palace. Valide says that exile is an extreme punishment for the mother of his Şehzade. Suleiman insists that Mahidevran went against him, and harmed one of his harem. He then states that it is only because she’s the mother of his first child that she lives still. He is later convinced by Ibrahim and the Valide to keep her in the palace for Mustafa’s sake.\n\nSultan Suleiman departs on his first campaign. In order to get rid of Hürrem in Suleiman's absence, the Valide Sultan plans to marry Hürrem to Casim Paşa's son. Hürrem refuses to leave and in an act of desperation, lies to the Valide Sultan and tells her she cannot leave because she is pregnant with Suleiman's child. The Valide Sultan lets Hürrem stay, but she tells Daye Hatun to take Hürrem to the midwife in secret to confirm this. Hürrem asks her best friend Maria to help her run away. Maria refuses as it would be impossible. When Daye Hatun and Nigar Kalfa come to take Hürrem to the midwife, Hürrem breaks a nearby vase, and threatens to commit suicide with a shard of glass if they come any closer. Nigar gently convinces Hürrem to put the glass down. They take her to the midwife, and Hürrem discovers that she actually is pregnant.\n\nSuleiman receives news about Hürrem's pregnancy, and is overjoyed. Several weeks later, he returns from his campaign. He greets his mother, his sister, his former consort Gülfem Hatun, his son, and barely greets Mahidevran. He then summons Hürrem to his chambers, and they joyfully reunite. He then gifts her a beautiful necklace as a sign of his love and gratitude, and he admires her growing belly. Mahidevran, burning with hatred and envy of Hürrem’s pregnancy, and the love she and Suleiman share, decides that she’s had enough of the neglect and disrespect from Suleiman and Hürrem respectively. She conspires with her maid Gülşah, who enlists another concubine, Hasibe, to put poison in Hürrem’s dessert, telling the concubine that it will only make Hürrem Hatun so sick that she'll be unable to lie with the Sultan that evening. Though deeply apprehensive, Hasibe succeeds in her task. Mahidevran prays in her chambers, and asks Allah to forgive her for her impending grave sin. Clinging to the hope that with Hürrem dead, things will go back to the way they used to be for her, Mustafa, and Suleiman. While Hürrem and Suleiman are laughing and dining together, Hürrem suddenly cries out in pain as the poison reaches her belly, and then faints. Suleiman frantically tries to wake her, but she is motionless. Suleiman commands the chief physician be brought at once, while yelling for his concierge Ibrahim. Gülşah learns that the poison has indeed been taken by Hürrem Hatun, and that she may die. The liable concubine, Hasibe, learns of the unfolding events, and is riddled with guilt and terror at what she has done. Worried that Hasibe would give them away, Gülşah smothers the girl to death with a pillow, and then strings her up to make it seem as though she hung herself. Meanwhile the Sultan summons the physicians, and they just barely save Hürrem’s life. The physicians then inform the Sultan that she was indeed poisoned, and hope that her unborn child hasn't been harmed. Ibrahim Paşa then finally arrives in utter shock. Suleiman, enraged that his concierge wasn’t around, and hadn’t prevented something like this from happening, berates Ibrahim on how he could’ve let poison come to the Sultan’s table. He then orders Ibrahim to personally find the culprit. And when he does, no matter who they are, they will be beheaded. The Valide Sultan, and Hatice Sultan hear of this troubling news from Daye Hatun, and race to the private chamber. Suleiman informs his mother and sister that Hürrem was most assuredly poisoned, because he saw with his own eyes what came out of her. Her insides were rotting. Hürrem, who is very ill and delirious, calls out to her dead family, asking them to take her. Suleiman, commands Hürrem to fight the poison as she is his Sultan, and he’ll never let her go. This declaration visibly surprises Valide Sultan and Hatice Sultan. Hürrem worries her baby was hurt, as he’s not moving around in her belly. Suleiman affirms that the baby will live; the alternative is unthinkable. Suleiman sleeps next to Hürrem all night, and never leaves her side. The next morning Hürrem awakens to her son kicking, to her utter delight. She awakens Suleiman, and places his hand on her belly to feel the kicking. They laugh and cry with relief that their baby lives.\n\nMeanwhile Ibrahim Paşa interrogates anyone and everyone to find the culprit. He learns that the concubine who did it is dead from allegedly hanging herself. However, Ibrahim believes there is a piece of the story missing. He later questions Gülşah Hatun, to the point of beating the truth out of her. She relents and tells him she's committed no sin as she was commanded to do it by Mahidevran Sultan. Ibrahim threatens her to not breathe a word of this to anyone or he will kill her. Mahidevran is in good spirits, and is feeling hopeful for the future as she heard that last night Hürrem was fighting for her life, and believes Hürrem to be on her deathbed if not already dead. She is summoned by Sümbül Ağa to Ibrahim Paşa’s chamber. She jovially inquires to Hürrem’s health, but learns quickly from Sümbül, as well as the trays of food coming in and out of the private chamber, that Hürrem survived, and is recuperating in the private chamber under Suleiman’s care. This news fills her with anguish and dread. Ibrahim invites her into his chamber, and tells her that he knows it was her who was responsible for Hürrem's poisoning, and berates her as she very well could have poisoned the Sultan for which the consequences would be grave. She maintains that Suleiman is already poisoned by Hürrem’s wicked presence, and she has no remorse. Ibrahim tells her he can’t protect her if she continues to make these rash mistakes. Mahidevran defiantly questions how can the Paşa protect what the Sultan himself doesn’t protect. Ibrahim commands her to stay away from Hürrem, and to ignore her and the Sultan’s relationship. Hearing the lilt of Hürrem and Suleiman’s laughter next door in the private chamber, Mahidevran bitterly remarks how Ibrahim is asking her to repress herself, her heart, and her feelings. To turn herself to stone. Ibrahim tells her how much he cares for her and Mustafa, and that he’ll always be there to protect and help them. Mahidevran begs Ibrahim not to punish Gülsah as she is all she has in the harem. Ibrahim tells Mahidevran to send Gülsah away for a while, until things calm down. They both agree that Hürrem must be destroyed.\n\nThe Sultan leaves to tend to his state affairs, and Hürrem approaches Ibrahim Paşa and asks him if he has found her would-be murderer. He coldly tells her that the matter is closed, and to let it go. She then implies that he wasn’t there to serve/save their Sultan or herself, and he’s more involved than he’s letting on. In the meantime, the Valide Sultan decides Hürrem should have a bigger chamber so that she’ll be more comfortable during her pregnancy, and have help when her child is born. She will also be given concubines who will tend to her and serve her now that she’s becoming a member of the dynasty. She chooses Ayşe, Nigar, and her best friend Maria. Hürrem enters her new chamber, and is very pleased. Maria enters not long after, and marvels at Hürrem’s luxurious and spacious new chamber. Hürrem giddily informs Maria that she will be staying there with her, as she has chosen Maria to be her personal concubine. The two embrace happily, and Maria decides to inform Hürrem that she has converted to Islam, and was renamed by Sümbül Ağa. Her new name is now Gülnihal which means “young and beautiful.” Hürrem is disgusted to hear this news, and demands to know why Maria would do such a thing. This information now makes Hürrem view her only friend as a rival. She then decides to trust her friend wouldn’t betray her, and accepts her new name. What Hürrem doesn’t fully know is that Gülnihal wants to become a Sultan herself, and has recruited Sümbül Ağa to help her rise through the Harem. In the middle of the night, Hürrem goes into labor and calls out for Gülnihal, but she doesn’t appear. She’s screaming in pain through the halls begging for help when Nigar Kalfa finds her, and summons the midwife. While this is going on Suleiman wanted to summon Hürrem to his chamber, but he is then informed that she is in labor. Suleiman is very happy at this news. He then decides that since Hürrem cannot come to him, he will summon her best friend Gülnihal to his chamber. While Gülnihal is excited at this news, she is also apprehensive, and terrified of Hürrem’s probable wrath should she find out. Sümbül tells her to forget about Hürrem, and think of herself and the life she could have if she’ll take it for herself. After a difficult, and arduous labor, Hürrem gives birth to a boy, Şehzade Mehmed.\n\nLater on, after much gloating and boasting that she’ll give birth to yet another Şehzade, Hürrem gives birth to a daughter whom (while Suleiman is off on a campaign) the Valide Sultan names Mihrimah, meaning “sun and moon.” This news mildly devastates Hürrem as she had been so sure and hopeful that she would have another Şehzade. For some time she would not even hold Mihrimah or feed her, wanting nothing to do with her female child. Suleiman, hearing of the birth, returns from the campaign to meet his daughter. Hürrem is afraid that he will be disappointed and upset with her for not giving him another son, but this turns out to be false. His child is still his child, and he loves her with all his heart. This revelation warms Hürrem to her daughter.\n\nMeanwhile Suleiman's and Hürrem's relationship begins to sour, and the Sultan prefers to spend time with others. He also brings Mahidevran Sultan back into his favor. After being wrongfully accused of killing Ayşe Hatun, one of the sultan’s favorites, Hürrem is sent into exile at the old palace in Edirne with only her daughter Mihrimah Sultan, as Mehmed is an heir to the throne and cannot leave Topkapı Palace. Hürrem is torn apart by the thought of abandoning her son, and her beloved Sulieman thinking such evil of her. Her innocence is later proven, however, when a concubine comes forth with information about the murder. Ayşe Hatun’s murderer was not as tall as Hürrem, thus absolving her of any crime. She returns to Topkapı Palace with Mihrimah Sultan, and she and Suleiman finally reconcile. Hürrem once again becomes his most favorite concubine.\n\nOne afternoon, Valide Sultan, in another attempt to drive a wedge between Hürrem and Suleiman, invites Hürrem to accompany her and her daughter Hatice Sultan to visit the latter’s new palace while it’s being prepared for her upcoming marriage to Ibrahim Paşa. This is a ruse to get Hürrem away from the palace while Sümbül Ağa prepares a Hungarian concubine, Sadika Hatun, to visit the private chamber. Sadika, formerly named Viktoria, has ulterior motives of her own as she is in the palace on a mission to assassinate Sultan Suleiman in retribution for his murder of her late fiancé Ariel, a Hungarian prince. Viktoria endeared herself to members of the dynasty by not only being very obedient and a useful servant, but also by her act of rescuing the two young Şehzades from a fire that started in the harem. No one realized, however, that she was the culprit who started the fire in order to kill the Şehzades. At the last moment however, she regretted her actions and pulled them from the flames. Valide Sultan is so grateful for Viktoria’s supposed heroics, that she takes the young woman to be her personal servant and even named her “Sadika” which, ironically, means “she who is loyal and truthful.” It turns out that Sadika is also the true murderer of Ayşe Hatun, as the unfortunate concubine had suspected Sadika’s ill intentions in the palace. Meanwhile, as Sadika Hatun is in the private chamber with Suleiman, allowing his advances as she prepares to stab him to death, down in the gardens, Mahidevran Sultan and her maid Gülşah are taking Şehzade Mustafa on a walk by the fountains. Gülnihal and two other servants are also taking Şehzade Mehmed for a walk as well. Gülnihal excused herself to go feed Mihrimah Sultan, and leaves the infant Şehzade in the hands of the other two servants as well as Mahidevran Sultan and Gülşah. Mahidevran and Gülşah are complaining to each other about Hürrem being welcomed back to the palace after her temporary exile. Mahidevran laments that they were finally free of her at last, and things were so close to being the way they were before Hürrem came in and robbed her of all she held dear. Consumed in their conversation, no one witnesses Şehzade Mehmed crawling into the fountain. It is only when they hear Şehzade Mustafa crying out that they realize what has happened. In a stunning turn of events, Mahidevran pulls Mehmed from the fountain, saving him from a watery grave. Up in the private chamber, Suleiman hears the commotion outside and runs to the terrace to find Mahidevran holding his soaked and motionless son. The boy lives as he begins to cry and scream, much to her relief. Suleiman exits the private chamber in a rush to the gardens, completely forgetting Sadika Hatun’s presence entirely. Realizing her assassination attempt has failed, she goes back to the harem. Suleiman arrives in the gardens, irate that the servants weren’t properly looking after his son. Gülşah tells the Sultan that it was Şehzade Mustafa who alerted them, and Mahidevran Sultan who saved him. Suleiman gives Mehmed to the servants and commands them to bring him inside before he gets sick. He then comforts his son Mustafa, who is quite upset from the ordeal. Suleiman tells his son that he did the right thing, and that he should always protect his brother. He then sincerely thanks Mahidevran Sultan for saving his son. Meanwhile, Hürrem, Valide Sultan, and Hatice Sultan return from visiting Hatice’s palace in learn of Şehzade Mehmed’s near drowning. Horrified, Hürrem demands to know her son’s whereabouts, and is bewildered to learn that he is in Mahidevran Sultan’s chambers, and that Mahidevran herself is his savior. The women race over to Mahidevran’s chambers and Hürrem joyfully embraces her son, holding him close and relieved that he is safe. As she prepares to leave to take him back to her own rooms, she turns to Mahidevran Sultan and says “May Allah bless you Sultan, you gave me my son.”\n\nHürrem later gives Suleiman a second son, Şehzade Selim, but she is still unsatisfied because as the Ottoman traditions require, Sultan Suleiman must grace other concubines with his favors. When a Russian slave girl, Tanya, is brought as a personal gift to the Sultan, Hürrem cannot contain her jealousy and hurt. She decides to confront Suleiman. With the ornate dagger he had given her as a gift clenched tightly and painfully in her hand, Hürrem tearfully asks Suleiman to kill her and end her pain. She reminds him that she is not Mahidevran Sultan, and she will not share their love with anyone. If he doesn’t love only her, she may as well be dead. Suleiman is irate at Hürrem’s gall and blatant disrespect of his authority, and he angrily orders her to return to her chamber. As he takes the bloody dagger from her hand, Hürrem gives Suleiman a daring ultimatum--either he sends the Russian concubines away, or she will leave the palace herself. Overnight, Hürrem attempts to make plans to leave the palace, even though it would be impossible to escape with her children. The next day, Mahidevran Sultan and Gülşah bask in the joy of Hürrem’s impudent behavior, believing she will be seriously punished or even banished. However, they soon learn from Sümbül Ağa that Sultan Suleiman decided to send the Russian concubines away, effectively choosing Hürrem. This news deeply upsets Mahidevran as well as Valide Sultan. The pair of them believing that this is a disgrace for tradition and the rules, and that Hürrem has the Sultan wrapped around her finger. Suleiman goes to Hürrem’s chamber, and asks for her forgiveness. He gifts her a beautiful, handcrafted tulip brooch (tulips being the symbol of the Ottoman Dynasty) that he made himself, and he reaffirms his love for Hürrem.\n\nLater on, Leopold (Leo), Hürrem's presumed dead former fiancé during her early years in Ruthenia, arrives in an attempt to find her and take her home. He is recognized as a talented artist, and is commissioned by the Sultan to decorate his sister Hatice Sultan's palace. He is also commissioned to paint two portraits: Suleiman alone, and together with Hürrem. Once Hürrem finally lays eyes on him, she is absolutely baffled by his presence. All this time she believed he was dead, killed in the slave raid in their village all those years ago. This shock is almost too much for her to take. Leo makes many attempts to speak with her alone and reaffirm his adoration of her, but according to Hürrem, that time has passed and she believes their love is over. Hürrem still deeply cares for him, but she is the Sultan’s love, and is the mother of his children. Hürrem tries to warn Leo that it is very dangerous for him to be here given the circumstances, and that he should go back home as soon as possible before either one of them get hurt. But Leo will not go without \"Alexandra\", his long lost love. During this time, Hürrem and Leo’s history is unfortunately learned by Ibrahim Paşa. Because of the rivalry and developing hatred between Ibrahim and Hürrem, Ibrahim seizes the opportunity to blackmail and destroy Hürrem. He leaves a bowl of poisoned delights for her and Leo, and tells them to decide who leaves the room alive. Distraught by the tragic turn of events, and the idea of having to choose whether she lives or if her former fiancé lives, Hürrem weeps in despair. Realizing that this is truly the end, Leo sacrifices himself and eats the poisoned delight. Soon after, he dies in Hürrem's arms, proving his everlasting love and honor. She later on gives birth to her fourth child, Şehzade Bayezid. Once again, Sultan Suleiman is overjoyed, while Mahidevran despairs over her own son, Şehzade Mustafa, having yet another rival for the Ottoman throne.\n\nThe Legal wife of the Sultan[]\n\nCastilian Princess Isabella Fortuna and her servant are kidnapped by Turkish pirates, and are sold to Sultan Suleiman's harem. Hürrem is very jealous of the attention that the striking Isabella receives from Suleiman, and threatens her life multiple times. She even sends a venomous snake to the hunting lodge where Isabella has been staying. Suleiman, however, was there to save her life when the snake bit her ankle. This incident brings the two closer and Isabella, though at first utterly disgusted by Suleiman and his allegedly barbaric ways, begins to begrudgingly return Suleiman’s attraction. Desperate, Hürrem decides that she’ll help Princess Isabella escape. The two agree on an escape plan, and Hürrem forcefully takes back the necklace Suleiman made for the princess that she herself wanted. They attempt the plan, but the princess desists when her guard Malkoçoğlu Bali Bey’s life is threatened by those who would liberate her. Eventually, Princess Isabella falls in love with Suleiman. She moves into the harem, and becomes Suleiman's favorite. Valide Sultan takes a deep liking to Princess Isabella, and believes her to be a more suitable match for Suleiman than Hürrem because Princess Isabella is a noblewoman, and Hürrem is only a concubine. Mahidevran Sultan sees Isabella as the perfect tool to destroy Hürrem, even though she is now the lover of the Sultan and her new rival as well. Hürrem decides once and for all to be rid of Princess Isabella, and with the help of Gül Ağa, Nigar Kalfa, and her new servant Nilüfer, she succeeds in sending Princess Isabella to Vienna, where she returns to the monastery.\n\nMahidevran Sultan gives the Valide Sultan Leo's old diary with pages covered in Hürrem, which Gulşah picked up after Hürrem threw it out of window in a desperate attempt to get rid of it. The Valide calls Hürrem to her chambers, but then she faints. Hürrem calls for help and then she attempts to take the diary. Daye notices it, and takes it before Hürrem can. She later gives it to the Valide Sultan, and she tries to use it to make Hürrem Sultan leave. To save herself, Hürrem offers an estate to Daye which she eventually accepts, and in exchange Daye gives the diary to Hürrem. When the Valide Sultan comes to Hürrem's chambers, she throws the diary into fire, destroying the only evidence of her and Leo's former relationship.\n\nWhen Suleiman returns home from another campaign, Hürrem greets him passionately. Later, the two are dining together, and Hürrem laments that she cannot practice charity because she is a slave. Suleiman, after having four children with Hürrem, decides to finally free her. She is overjoyed at this news, and brags to the harem that she is now above them all, including Mahidevran, as she is now a free woman. This declaration is the perfect opportunity for Hürrem to achieve what she has so long desired; to become the Sultan's legal wife. One night, Suleiman requests Hürrem come to his chambers, but she refuses. He demands again, but she won't budge. He storms over to her chambers demanding an explanation, and she calmly tells him that while she loves and adores him, she cannot share a bed with him anymore because she is a free woman. It is forbidden in their religion for a free woman to share a bed with a man if she is not married to him. Suleiman then correctly deduces that she has concocted the story about charity because she wanted to marry him. Valide Sultan finds out about this disgrace, and confronts Hürrem who defends her actions stating that she is only trying to be a good Muslim. Valide silently decides that this is the perfect opportunity for her to get what she herself has long desired; to be rid of Hürrem. She feigns admiration of Hürrem's piety, and congratulates her on making the proper decision, but reminds her that she still must follow harem rules. Enraged by Hürrem's supposed betrayal, Suleiman sends her away to the old palace with the assistance of the Valide Sultan, who sets a trap for her. Valide feigns sending for Hürrem to return to the palace, but sends assailants to kill Hürrem on her journey. Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey defeats most of them, but spares one for interrogation. In the chaos however, Hürrem has gone missing. This news reaches a remorseful Suleiman who orders a search mission for her. The Sultan sends Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey to interrogate the remaining assailant to find out who ordered this attack. Several janissaries search the woods near where the ambush occurred, but no one can find Hürrem anywhere. Wandering into the forest himself, Suleiman wonders where his lost love has gone, as he can feel in his heart that she's still alive somewhere. Hürrem, clinging to life by a thread on the forest floor hears Suleiman searching for her. She is so weak however, that she cannot call out to him loud enough. She nearly surrenders herself to her fate when she is finally found by Sultan Suleiman. He returns to Topkapı Palace with Hürrem Sultan in his arms. While she is ill and injured, she will survive and she is reunited with her children. Valide Sultan, irritated that her trap failed, advises her son that Hürrem's act of defiance still needs proper punishment, and that once she recovers enough, Hürrem should be sent away again, albeit to a closer location. This ordeal however has softened Suleiman's anger, and made the Sultan realize the depth of his love for Hürrem. He decides not to banish the mother of his children, and then privately decides that he will instead marry her as she wished.\n\nAfter legally marrying Hürrem, she and Sultan Suleiman go to give the Valide Sultan the happy news. In the presence of his mother, Hatice Sultan, Gülfem Hatun, and Mahidevran Sultan, Sultan Suleiman announces his marriage to Hürrem. This news sends a shockwave through the room, and for a moment everyone is speechless. Hürrem is beaming with joy, Nigar Kalfa secretly smiles at this news, Hatice Sultan and Gülfem Hatun are stunned into silence, Valide Sultan is frozen in place, and Mahidevran Sultan is silently devastated. Expecting a warmer response than this, Suleiman sends Hürrem over to pay respects to his mother. But when Hürrem tries to kiss her hand, the Valide Sultan stands up, and vents her displeasure with their marriage which she considers unacceptable and disgraceful. Valide, overwhelmed with this appalling and scandalous news, faints in her son's arms. She is then taken to her daughter Hatice's chambers to rest. Meanwhile, İbrahim Paşa is shot during the marriage ceremony with an arrow, and it turns out that it was poisoned. Hürrem is afraid that she will be blamed for this because she had sent an archer to kill İbrahim Paşa, but she called off the attack at the last minute when she saw Hatice Sultan's sadness at their uncertain future together.\n\nHürrem later becomes pregnant, and gives birth to her fifth and final child, Şehzade Çihangir.\n\nBecoming Haseki Sultan[]\n\nTime passes, while the Sultan goes to war, and the Valide Sultan and Mahidevran Sultan conspire against Hürrem. The Valide places a spy, and pretends to let Hürrem lead the harem for a while. During the rebellion provoked by the Valide's spy, Fatma Hatun, one of the slaves is accused of stealing gold, and the innocent girl burns herself. The concubines take torches and march towards Hürrem's chambers to try to burn her alive. Daye and the guards save her, but not without the slaves severely burning Hürrem's face. Daye gets discharged for this by the Valide Sultan as a means to cover her own tracks, and for foiling her and Mahidevran's scheme.\n\nWhen the Sultan comes back and finds out what has happened, he tells his mother that she is not capable of leading the harem, and he is tired of all the fighting. Hürrem Sultan and Mahidevran Sultan fight after Gülşah Hatun gets Daye's old position, and Mahidevran tries to slap her. Suleiman arrives which stops Mahidevran in her tracks. He commands Mahidevran to apologize to Hürrem, which Mahidevran had no choice but to comply. She returns to her chamber and weeps at how the Sultan and Hürrem treated her. She twists the story in her favor, and acts the victim in front of her servants and her son Mustafa. Seeing his mother weep once more, Mustafa barges into Hürrem's chambers to confront his father, and they have a heated discussion about the way Hürrem manipulates him, which makes Suleiman very angry. Later Hürrem argues with Mustafa, and Suleiman makes her apologize for it. Hürrem is displeased so they too have an argument.\n\nMustafa falls in love with a concubine named Nora (whom he later names later Efsun.) He doesn't know that Efsun works for Hürrem Sultan, and she has orders to poison him. Efsun puts poison in his meal, but at the last moment she regrets it, and overturns the food. Efsun falls in love with the Şehzade, and later becomes pregnant with his child.\n\nŞehzade Çihangir, Hürrem's youngest son, becomes ill. Hürrem doesn't tell Süleiman which infuriates him. But after seeing his son so sick, he and Hürrem unite and he calls a doctor. Çihangir is developing a hump on his back, and they try to fix it while he is still a baby with physiotherapy. Çihangir gets better even though he can't recover fully, and Süleiman suddenly has a heart attack. Mahidevran Sultan is conscious that when Suleiman dies, her son could be the Sultan. She tries to convince Mustafa that he needs to take precautions with his brothers, but he refuses. She then talks to İbrahim Paşa about Mustafa's possible rise to the throne, and Ibrahim warns Mahidevran to not be so eager to watch their Sultan die, as it wouldn't end well for her. Mahidevran says that Suleiman stopped caring about her so long ago that all she associates him with is pain and rejection, and that any love she has left is for her son to become the next Sultan of the Ottomans. It's time for the era of Valide Mahidevran Sultan. The Valide Hafsa Sultan, who stood just outside of Mahidevran's chamber door, hears this and sends Hürrem and her children to Hatice Sultan's palace in order to protect them from Mahidevran. During the time of his unconsciousness, Suleiman heard the words of those around him, including Mahidevran's vicious scheming. At Hatice Sultan's palace, Hürrem Sultan is beside herself with grief and fear for her children's fates. She has Gül Ağa prepare a poison for her and her children, wanting to take charge of their fate and not leave it to Mahidevran Sultan, should Suleiman die soon. Suleiman finally wakes up, with Ibrahim Paşa by his side, who orders Sümbül Ağa to summon the physicians, and share the news with the palace. Nigar Kalfa arrives at Ibrahim Paşa and Hatice Sultan's palace to deliver the excellent news to Hürrem and her children. Overwhelmed with relief and joy, Hürrem falls to her knees weeping, and the family prepares to return to Topkapı Palace. At Suleiman's bedside, Valide Sultan, Hatice Sultan, Gülfem Hatun, Şehzade Mustafa, and Mahidevran Sultan share their relief that he has rejoined them. Although Valide Sultan, fully aware of Mahidevran's failed plot to seize the throne, knows that Mahidevran's well wishes are only out of self-preservation. Triumphant, Hürrem Sultan and her children arrive back at the palace, and visit an alive and talking Sultan Suleiman. Once he recovers, Sultan Suleiman arrives to greet his harem. Hürrem Sultan finds her place in the line of rank, and it's ahead of Mahidevran Sultan, who has fallen even farther from grace due to her machinations.\n\nMahidevran finds out that Efsun is pregnant and wants to make her abort the pregnancy, but Mustafa stops her in time and sends Efsun to his chambers. Hürrem Sultan tells the Valide about Efsun's pregnancy, and she sends Daye Hatun to get rid of the baby. Mustafa doesn't manage to save her this time, and both the baby and Efsun Hatun die. Moments before her death however, she warns Mustafa to watch out for Hürrem Sultan as she was the one who ordered Efsun to poison him. Mahidevran tells this to Suleiman who summons Hürrem to his chambers so that he can learn the truth for himself. He gives her a poison and tells her that she has a choice: to die near him, or to be executed away from him. Devastated, Hürrem shows no reluctance in drinking the poison, as she would die in her love's arms. While weeping and taking her last breaths, she entrusts their children to Suleiman, and begs him to watch out for them, and to protect them from Mahidevran Sultan's and Ibrahim Paşa's cruelty. This turned out to be a test to see if Hürrem would either defy him, or admit her sins with her dying breaths. Since she did neither and willingly offered her life into his hands, Suleiman believes that she is innocent. Hürrem awakens the following morning in utter shock and confusion as she is still alive and breathing. Lying next to her, Suleiman reveals that this was all a test, and that the poison was actually a medicine to make her sleep. Suleiman grants her any wish she desires as a reward for her unwavering loyalty to him. While slightly incredulous at his constant tests to prove her love and loyalty, Hürrem merely asks him to embrace her as she is overwhelmed and emotional with the previous night's events.\n\nIt is later revealed that Nigar Hatun and Ibrahim Paşa have been having an extramarital affair. When Valide Sultan finds out, she slaps Nigar Hatun across the face. She then collapses from the shock of her son-in-law's betrayal of her daughter Hatice Sultan. It is revealed she has had a stroke. Hürrem comes to her chambers, and tells her shocking news that Nigar Hatun is now pregnant with Ibrahim Paşa's child. This news causes the Valide Sultan another stroke, and she dies. Hürrem gets her revenge on the Valide, despite their relationship becoming better.\n\nNow, Mahidevran Sultan rules the harem, which makes Hürrem try to get rid of her and Mustafa. Mustafa leaves for the province of Manisa, but Ibrahim convinces Suleiman to let Mahidevran Sultan stay in the harem.\n\nHürrem conspires against Mahidevran by making her appear to be the person who had ordered a servant to strangle Gülfem Hatun. Sultan Suleiman gives Hürrem Sultan the leadership of the harem.\n\nHaseki Hürrem Sultan[]\n\nHürrem Sultan is furious once she is informed by Hatice Sultan that she and Ibrahim Paşa will not divorce, despite him being unfaithful to her with Nigar Hatun, and quickly begins to devise another plan. She seizes the chambers of the late Valide Sultan which enrages Hatice Sultan, and the two women argue. Hatice Sultan then informs Sultan Suleiman, and he orders Hürrem to vacate the chambers immediately. However Mihrimah Sultan, who has fallen from her horse, now resides in her mother's previous chambers to recuperate. She convinces her father to give the chambers of the late Valide Sultan to her mother Hürrem Sultan so that she can stay in her mother's former chambers. Suleiman accepts this.\n\nHızır Reis finds a young woman amongst a shipwreck, and sells her to Topkapı Palace. Hatice Sultan suffers a stroke in the corridors of Topkapı after seeing Hürrem Sultan mock her from the terrace. The unknown young woman heals her. Gülfem Hatun witnesses this, and asks the woman's name. Her name is Firuze, and she came from Assyria. Once Hatice Sultan fully recovers, she thanks Firuze for saving her life. Then Sultan Suleiman arrives, and Firuze has a strange vision of him. The rumor of Firuze's healing talent spreads through the harem. Afife Hatun, Suleiman's and Hatice Sultan's wet nurse and nanny, has been appointed to run the Harem. Afife chooses Firuze as a concubine for the Sultan, and unbeknownst to Hürrem Sultan, Afife sends her to Sultan Suleiman's chambers, and he quickly falls in love with her.\n\nHürrem Sultan orders her servants to search for the young woman, but Hatice Sultan and Mahidevran Sultan pretend that it was Firuze's friend Nadia that had been sent to Suleiman's chambers, not Firuze. Hurrem executes the girl in by hanging her from the ceiling in the harem, and takes her revenge on Hatice Sultan by bringing Nigar Hatun back to the palace. Hürrem then threatens that she will inform everyone about Ibrahim and Nigar's relationship. Hatice Sultan later sends the letter that Suleiman had written for Firuze Hatun to Hürrem's chambers in order to make her angry. Hatice later puts Gülşah Hatun in dungeons as she had overheared her conversation with Firuze about her and the Sultan's relationship. Hürrem Sultan helps Gülşah Hatun escape, and orders her to kill Hatice Sultan at midnight, but Nigar Hatun saves Hatice Sultan's life and kills Gülşah Hatun.\n\nYears go by, and Hürrem Sultan finally discovers Firuze Hatun's deceit as she had sent her as a concubine to her eldest son Şehzade Mehmed per a suggestion by Nigar Hatun, who already knew the truth. But as Firuze Hatun was the Sultan's concubine, it was strictly forbidden for her to have intimate relations with a Şehzade. Firuze, deciding that Hürrem Sultan is going to learn the truth sooner or later, confesses to the Haseki that she has been sharing a bed with her husband the Sultan for years. Hürrem, enraged at Firuze's betrayal and deceit, grabs the young Hatun in a chokehold until her youngest son, Şehzade Çihangir, walks in on the violent scene. Hürrem furiously promises Afife Hatun that she will destroy Firuze in such a manner that the Hatun will beg for death. Sultan Suleiman decides to go on a hunting trip with his family, but Mihrimah Sultan doesn't agree to accompany them as Firuze Hatun has been chosen to be by the Sultan's side instead of her mother, the Haseki. This news frustrates Hürrem Sultan because while she appreciates her daughter defending her, Mihrimah cannot disrespect her father, the Sultan, this way. However, Mihrimah Sultan's interference proves to be somewhat successful as her father decides to not bring Firuze or Mihrimah; he will only bring Şehzade Mehmed.\n\nA few years later Hürrem finally finds Kader, the daughter of Nigar Hatun and İbrahim Paşa. She notifies İbrahim Paşa, and threatens that she may kill Kader, but ultimately gives the child to him. İbrahim Paşa later makes Hürrem Sultan think that he has killed Şehzade Mehmed in retaliation for what she did with his daughter. While trying to kill Firuze on Hürrem Sultan's command, Rüstem Paşa finds out that the tattoo on the back of Firuze's neck is connected to the Safavid dynasty. He notifies Hürrem Sultan, who vindictively decides to inform Suleiman. Hatice Sultan and İbrahim Paşa learn of Firuze's deception soon after, and both are shocked. Seeing as they both had a heavy hand in installing Firuze as his majesty's favorite, this news could very negatively implicate them. After hearing Firuze Hatun's explanation for her ruse, Suleiman ultimately feels betrayed, and decides to send Firuze away, much to Hürrem's profound relief. Firuze was to be sent to a hunting lodge in Amaysa, but on her journey the Persian soldiers find her and escort her back to Persia. They also reveal her true name as Humeyra while telling her that the Shah Tahmasp I and the real Firuze Begumhan Sultan have been concerned for her return. She smiles knowing how she has truly fooled everyone in the Topkapı Palace.\n\nHürrem and İbrahim Paşa continue to plot against each other. She later summons İbrahim to a place outside the city in order to kill him, but her men don't succeed and he survives. Meanwhile, Hürrem Sultan sends a spy to Manisa to kill Şehzade Mustafa, but the girl doesn't succeed and confesses in front of Şehzade Mustafa that it was Hürrem Sultan who had sent her to assassinate him. Şehzade Mustafa informs Ibrahim Paşa who brings the girl to Sultan Suleiman, but instead of accusing Hürrem Sultan, she accuses Ibrahim Paşa telling the Sultan that Ibrahim Paşa had asked her to accuse Hürrem Sultan of trying to kill Mustafa. Then she immediately commits suicide. Sultan Suleiman grows suspicious about İbrahim as a result of Hürrem's plots. Hürrem Sultan and Ayas Paşa gather the government documents which show that Ibrahim Paşa had abused the power that was given to him by the Sultan. Meanwhile, the Sultan's sister Şah Huban Sultan and her family arrive to the palace at Hatice Sultan's invitation, and she pretends that she doesn't want to stand against Hürrem Sultan.\n\nSultan Suleiman, after much deliberation and reviewing evidence, ultimately decides to execute his longtime friend, confidant, and adviser İbrahim Paşa for treason after inviting him for dinner. He then sends his corpse to Hatice Sultan's palace for his sister to discover. Hatice Sultan is shattered at the death of her beloved husband, and disowns her brother Suleiman just as their sister Beyhan Sultan had when her husband Ferhat Paşa was executed by Suleiman. Together, Hatice and Mahidevran plan to murder Hürrem by sending Diana, Mahidevran Sultan's servant, as revenge since they see her solely responsible for the execution of İbrahim. The girl doesn't succeed as the guards arrive, but she pretends that it was another servant who wanted to kill Hürrem Sultan. Hatice Sultan is banished to Manisa after Süleiman finds out that it was her plan to assassinate Hürrem. Finally, Şah Sultan decides to stand against Hürrem Sultan for her self-interests.\n\nDiana, who hadn't succeeded in killing Hürrem, is now serving her loyally. Şah Sultan makes Hürrem think that Şehzade Mustafa is coming to usurp the throne from his father while Suleiman is on a campaign, and that Suleiman and her sons are wounded and trapped. Hürrem decides to take her sons, Şehzade Bayezid and Şehzade Çihangir (who had remained at the palace) away from Mustafa, but Şah takes Hürrem's sons to an old farm. Hürrem finds out, and goes there personally to save her sons. Şah Sultan is waiting for her there, and tells Hürrem that all of this was only a game. Hürrem then decides to finish Şah. Mihrimah Sultan is warned by her mother not to trust anyone except her.\n\nHatice Sultan returns to the palace, unbeknownst to Suleiman, and decides to finish Hürrem herself because she believes Şah is doing nothing. Hürrem secretly sends Şah's old love letter for Ibrahim Paşa to Hatice, and in turn Hatice she asks Şah to leave her palace immediately. She finally convinces Hatice that it would only please Hürrem if she sends her away so she lets her remain, and goes to the Topkapı Palace herself.\n\nHatice sends someone to tell Hürrem Sultan that Mihrimah Sultan was at the Marble Palace, but in reality Mihrimah never left Topkapı Palace. When Hürrem gets there, Hatice Sultan orders a woman who practices black magic to put a hanker chief with witch craft in Hürrem's mouth. Hürrem is found unconscious by Sümbül Ağa, her most loyal servant, and she is taken back to the palace. After some time, Hürrem discovers that she's being bewitched, and she warns Hatice not to mess with her. She later beats Hatice Sultan on her way to Suleiman's chambers, and orders her servants to throw her body in the woods. She is later found and brought back to the palace, but Hürrem convinces Suleiman that his sister is mad, and she had done this to herself so she could accuse Hürrem. Suleiman believes Hürrem, and sends Hatice to stay with Şah.\n\nŞah gets angry with Hatice. She has another plan to get rid of Hürrem Sultan. Hürrem later speaks with a priest, and she recites the Quran to feel well. Hatice shows a great amount of gold underneath her palace, and tells Şah to use it against Hürrem. Meanwhile Hürrem, who has been informed of Ibrahim's hidden treasure, tells Süleiman that his sisters have kept a huge amount of money hidden instead of paying it to the government after Ibrahim's death, but Bali Bey saves the Sultans by saying that they didn't know anything about this treasure.\n\nHürrem decides to borrow money from Rakilah, a wealthy loaner, but the money is stolen by Şah. Hürrem is forced to then borrow money from another woman, named Portia, before the Harem's girls start to make problems. Rakilah took orders from Şah to tell Hürrem Sultan that Portia could perhaps help Hürrem. Portia is a Venetian woman, and the Sultan was at war with Venice at that time. Hürrem took the money from Portia, and then gives her the gold she had received by selling one of her properties.\n\nThe Sultan returns from the campaign and arrives in Edirne. Şah has taken the papers of Hürrem and Portia's trade, and departs for Edirne to reveal everything to Suleiman, but Hürrem sends soldiers to attack her. Şah gives them the fake papers, and gives the real one to Suleiman. He decides to banish Hürrem to Edirne, and then returns to Topkapı Palace. Şah orders Rüstem Paşa to kill Hürrem Sultan while she's in Edirne, but he refuses and decides to stay loyal to Hürrem Sultan. He then demands a marriage to Mihrimah Sultan, which would make him closer to Sultan Suleiman, and he will be able to enter the Diwan. Hürrem Sultan accepts, but Mihrimah Sultan refuses after meeting her mother in Edirne.\n\nA Black Death epidemic breaks out, and Ayas Mehmed Paşa and Mustafa Paşa die from the epidemic. Then, Lütfi Paşa becomes Grand Vizier, and Şah Sultan becomes even more powerful. A doctor saves Hürrem Sultan by telling Sultan Suleiman that the illness is spreading in Edirne. Hürrem returns to Topkapı by Suleiman's orders. Mihrimah Sultan is betrothed to Rüstem Paşa.\n\nHürrem informs Mihrimah Sultan of her decision to marry her to Rüstem Paşa which makes Mihrimah deeply upset. Mihrimah continues to attract Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey toward herself, and secretly threatens the girl that he is in love with. In order to convince her daughter to let him go, Hürrem Sultan meets Balı Bey at the Marble Palace with Mihrimah hiding in the room next door. She overhears Balı Bey when he tells Hürrem Sultan that he still sees Mihrimah Sultan as a child, and he has no interest in her as a wife. This breaks her heart, but she decides to forget about Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey, and marries Rüstem Paşa.\n\nA forged letter is sent to Hürrem Sultan informing her that her son Şehzade Selim is seriously ill. Hürrem decides to go to Konya in order to see her son, but in reality he is well. Hürrem Sultan is captured on her way, and is imprisoned in a secret place. Mihrimah Sultan accuses Şah Sultan, Hatice Sultan and Mahidevran Sultan for this, but they refuse to accept their guilt. Suleiman gets very upset, and he begins a long and impossible search for his wife.\n\nHatice Sultan reconciles with her brother, but then she later commits suicide as she no longer wishes to live without her late husband. She too fears the Sultan's wrath as he learned that she was indeed responsible for Hürrem's disappearance. She died believing that she avenged her husband's execution.\n\nSultan Süleiman decides to go to war against Charles V, and he achieves a victory, while on the other hand Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey finds a lead on Ali Ağa (who was Hatice Sultan's servant, and is responsible for abducting Hürrem Sultan), and he goes to follow this lead without informing Sultan Suleiman in order to find Hürrem Sultan.\n\nMihrimah Sultan discovers that her aunt Şah Sultan has a spy in the Harem. She confronts and threatens the spy that she'll inform her father if she doesn't leave the city, and give away her money to Hürrem Sultan's charity institute. Meanwhile, Suleiman and Hürrem's son, Şehzade Mehmed is murdered by his closest Şahin Bey (Ilyas who has been working for Mahidevran Sultan) by wounding him, and transferring a contiguous disease into his body. This news reaches Sultan Suleiman who falls into deep sorrow, and feels that everything is falling apart. Malkoçoğlu Balı Bey succeeds in finding and rescuing Hürrem Sultan, and brings her back to the palace.\n\nDeath[]\n\nA soothsayer tells Hürrem Sultan that one of her children will become the next Sultan, but the Empire will be filled with blood. She is repulsed by this, and sends the witch away. Meanwhile, Sultan Suleiman blames himself for the death of Mehmed, and struggles to recover from the terrible loss. Upon the death of Mehmed, the Şehzades are called from their assigned provinces to the capital so that Suleiman can choose the next governor of Manisa.\n\nŞehzade Selim arrives to the capital first, and gains the approval of most of the people in the palace. Suleiman is having trouble choosing a suitable governor for Manisa, so he asks Hürrem's opinion. She suggests Selim. Hürrem has a secret salon where she can listen to the meeting of the Imperial Council. Suleiman announces his decision. Şehzade Selim is chosen as the new governor of Manisa. Hürrem hears this news from the secret salon, and is relieved. Şehzade Bayezid lashes out in anger because he believes he deserves the position more than his brother Selim. He blames his mother because he believes she must have influenced this decision. Mihrimah Sultan is upset about her father's decision, so she consults her mother and asks if she had anything to do with it. Hürrem confesses she did recommend Selim, but that the only reason she did was to protect Bayezid.\n\nHürrem orders Sümbül to look for strong and beautiful concubines to be chosen for Selim's harem. Cecilia is out at night looking at the stars before she gets captured by guards. She is brought to Hürrem Sultan's chambers, and tells her that she saw that the stars showing her that she would be chosen by Hürrem Sultan to be with Şehzade Selim. Hürrem considers this ridiculous, and she tells Cecilia that she will lose her head if she asks this again. Cecilia attempts to bribe Sümbül to let her join Selim by offering him a very expensive Venetian necklace. He agrees. In the middle of the night, Valeria (Cecilia's former maid) finds out about the deal, and she hands Sümbül the necklace on account of her going with Şehzade Selim. Valeria is chosen instead of Cecilia, much to Cecilia's surprise. At the last moment, Cecilia throws herself at Hürrem Sultan's feet, and begs her one last time. Hürrem finally accepts, and she makes Cecilia vow loyalty to her. She changes Cecilia's name to Nurbanu. Nurbanu warns Hürrem that Valeria is unsuitable for Şehzade Selim, so Hürrem expels Valeria from the journey.\n\nHürrem Sultan faints at night on her balcony, and the doctors discover that she is menopausal and cannot have anymore children . Embarrassed and afraid, she orders them to keep it a secret from everyone except Sümbül and Fariye, who were with her.\n\nFatma Sultan, another one of Suleiman's sisters, arrives to the capital with Hatice Sultan's daughter Huricihan Sultan. Everyone in the palace is surprised, including Hürrem Sultan, who was not expecting any visitors. Fatma Sultan tells her handmaid Melek that Mustafa has actually sent her to get rid of Hürrem. Fatma suspects something is wrong with Hürrem's health, so she blackmails the doctor into telling her about Hürrem's condition. Once she learns the truth, Fatma doesn't hesitate to tell everything to Suleiman which makes Hürrem embarrassed. Suleiman tells Hürrem that she shouldn't have hidden it from him, and that no matter what, he will always love her. After alerting Suleiman, Fatma announces Hürrem's condition to the entire harem during a ceremony. Mihrimah Sultan is offended as she was not trusted with this personal information, but warns Fatma Sultan to behave herself. Afife Hatun, having heard of Hürrem's current situation, suggests that it was possibly time for the Sultan to move on, but Hürrem Sultan refuses to accept sharing him with another woman. However, with Fatma Sultan's consent, a beautiful young woman is prepared and sent to Suleiman. Sümbül finds out and tells Hürrem Sultan, who entrusts the doorman, Lokman, with the task of getting rid of the girl. Lokman completes this task, and kills her before she could reach the sultan's door.\n\nHürrem, realizing that she can no longer give Suleiman children, prepares and sends a concubine to him herself. She picks Valeria. Suleiman spends the night with her, but everyone is surprised when they hear that Hürrem Sultan actually approved it. Suleiman discovers that Hürrem sent Valeria and he is shocked, but reassures her he did not feel anything for Valeria.\n\nHürrem discovers that Fatma Sultan divorced her husband because she was unfaithful to him, and tells Suleiman that Fatma Sultan wishes to remarry him, but she just couldn't tell him herself. Suleiman believes her, and plans for Fatma ?Sultan to remarry her former husband. She accepts, but only because she is forced to do so by Hürrem.\n\nFatma Sultan meets Valeria, and prepares her for Suleiman again. Valeria tells her that Hürrem Sultan had told her that she could only go one time. Fatma Sultan orders Valeria to stay away from Hürrem Sultan, and promises Valeria that she will help her become a Sultan. Fatma then renames Valeria, Nazenin.\n\nA few weeks later, Şehzade Bayezid decides to go to the capital to see Huricihan Sultan, but his mother finds out and scolds him. He says that she will lose him if she bans him from seeing Huricihan so she agrees to cover for them, but only this once. However, much to their dismay, Suleiman ends up finding out and sends Huricihan to live with his sister Beyhan Sultan.\n\nFor a few weeks Fatma continues to send Nazenin in secret to Suleiman, though he is unaware of the secrecy. After a few weeks, Nazenin admits a secret to Fatma Sultan: she is pregnant. Fatma takes advantage of the opportunity, and announces it in front of Suleiman and Hürrem, who is shocked and furious. Hürrem tries to get rid of the baby, but she regrets it at the last moment and saves Nazenin from drinking poison. Finally, after much struggle, Nazenin gives birth to a baby girl named Raziye Sultan.\n\nFatma Sultan finally gets married to her former husband. She is very upset because she doesn't love him. On their wedding night, Fatma intentionally overfeeds him, so that he has a heart attack and dies. Fatma finds out about Hürrem's secret salon because of a trick played by Mustafa, so she informs Suleiman. He feels betrayed, and believes that he can never trust Hürrem again. Instead of taking Hürrem, Süleiman takes Nazenin with himself to Manisa to bless the baby. Hürrem orders Nurbanu to prove her loyalty by killing Nazenin. Nurbanu is hesitant, but she succeeds by making it seem like she fell from the balcony, though the rail was rigged and she was pushed.\n\nSuleiman decides to exile Hürrem to Kütahya. On such short notice, Şehzade Bayezid has to find a place to hide Huricihan Sultan. Hürrem arrives, and Bayezid had enough time to send Huricihan to a safe place, hiding her until Hürrem leaves. Rana, Bayezid's concubine, is jealous of Huricihan Sultan, so she tells Hürrem about Huricihan and where she is hiding. Hürrem confronts Huricihan and slaps her, but Huricihan tells that her she never forgot what Hürrem did to her parents, and that she will be forced to take vengeance if she separates her from Bayezid.\n\nAfter a few days, Hürrem returns to the capital without Suleiman's permission, which makes him furious. He tells her that he can forgive her, but he will never be able to trust her again.\n\nHürrem orders Lala to get rid of Huricihan, but in order to stay with Bayezid, Huricihan strikes a deal with Lala telling him that Şehzade Mustafa and Mihrünnisa Sultan were married without the Sultan's permission. Hürrem uses this to her advantage. Mustafa gets a letter from Suleiman stating that he is very disappointed in him because he lied and disobeyed his orders.\n\nPiri Paşa decides that they should kill Hürrem Sultan because she is threatening Mustafa's path to the throne. During Mehmed's death anniversary, Hürrem heads to her son's mosque to pray over his tomb, but she becomes the victim of an assassination attempt on her way. Yavuz releases a pile of boulders hanging over them. Afife Hatun, in an attempt to protect Hürrem, gets in the way and is hit by most of the rocks. They all end up unconscious. When Hürrem wakes up, she finds out that Afife is dying. She gets up and goes to see her. Near death, Afife warns Hürrem that Suleiman is extremely ill. Then, she dies.\n\nSuleiman returns from his campaign because his illness got terribly worse. Everyone says that he is dying. Hürrem is worried, but she clings to the hope that Suleiman will survive. Suleiman murmurs the name of his oldest son Mustafa. Hürrem tells Rüstem \"This may be his last wish\". Hürrem has no choice but to summon Mustafa, and tells Rüstem that Süleiman wants his son to come. Hürrem, with the help of Rüstem and Mihrimah Sultan, sends a fake letter to the Persian Shah Tahmasp I. In the letter that has been sent without Mustafa's knowledge, they write about ruling the empire and seizing the throne while disposing Suleiman. The Sultan believes that Mustafa has betrayed him when he sees his son's seal on the letter.\n\nIn the year 1553 in Konya, Sultan Suleiman orders Şehzade Mustafa's execution. Suleiman later mourns the loss of his son Mustafa, and begins to doubt his decision of executing him. Meanwhile, Şehzade Bayezid comes to console Mahidevran Sultan, and assures her by swearing to Allah that he was not involved in his brother's murder. Mihrimah Sultan is also distraught with her brother's death, though she had a hand in it herself. Meanwhile, Şehzade Çihangir is deeply scarred by Mustafa's death, and in turn died soon afterwards, much to his family's sorrow.\n\nMahidevran Sultan and Mihrünnisa Sultan, Mustafa's widow, arrive at Topkapı Palace shortly. Soon after, Mihrünnisa confronts Hürrem with a dagger in hand. She declares that Hürrem took both her husband and her infant child from her thus creating an unending winter for her. However, she then declares her winter to finally be over, but that the Haseki's has only just begun. The grieving young widow then commits suicide by slitting her throat in front of everyone in the harem.\n\nWhile travelling to Manisa, Hürrem begins to feel sick. It is then revealed that she has an illness which has no cure, and that her death is near. Şehzades Bayezid and Selim declare an open war against each other. Şehzade Bayezid with many janissary soldiers sets out for Manisa to take Şehzade Selim accountable for all the wrong he has done. Bayezid reaches Manisa, and they both begin to fight, when suddenly their mother Hürrem arrives and stops them. She says that she would prefer Bayezid to be the next sultan, with Mihrimah Sultan's and Rüstem Paşa's support, but later decides that she cannot choose between her sons.\n\nAfter Hürrem's arrival back to Istanbul, Sümbül tells the Sultan about his wife's illness. Suleiman, in order to find a cure for her disease, takes Hürrem to Bursa where she visits a withering and aged Mahidevran Sultan. After all these years of chaos and strife, they finally forgive each other. Then with the help of Sümbül, she also finds the grave of İbrahim Paşa. She thanks him for choosing, and sending her to the Sultan's chamber for the first time many years ago. The Haseki's health is getting noticeably poor, and she knows her time is soon. After visiting with her family one last time, Hürrem dies in the arms of her beloved husband.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nIn the beginning, Alexandra was a brash and belligerent girl who didn't consider the consequences of her actions due to the trauma of being abducted from her homeland. She then sought love and protection from the Sultan even though it meant the hatred of his powerful family. She could often be extremely jealous, paranoid and reckless, thus breaking absolutely every standard of a \"proper woman\" that the Ottoman seraglio expected. Still, the Sultan was charmed by her due to her unbridled passion, fierce loyalty, and amusing demeanor.\n\nAs time went by, Hürrem matured, and began making wiser and more intelligent decisions, becoming the best strategist in the harem. Once she was given the title of Hürrem Sultan, she began to devise ways to manipulate the environment around her, and build her power for her own survival. Hürrem was an icon of influence that marked the entire state, with all those who invoked her name being terrorized.\n\nAlthough she could be a ruthless person, she never lacked empathy for her slaves and she often rewarded them with gold, safety, and even their freedom. As a mother, she was fiercely devoted to and protective of her children, loving them until her last breath. Throughout her life, she never had preferences among her children, and she diligently fought (though unsuccessfully) to free them from the law of succession by means of fratricide.\n\nPhysical description[]\n\nHürrem Sultan is a strikingly beautiful Ruthenian woman. She is tall, ivory-skinned, has a curvaceous figure, sparkling blue-grey eyes, and long, wavy, brilliant copper red hair, which can be considered her most attractive feature. Her clothing has varied over time, becoming more glamorous as she rose in rank. In her youth, Hürrem mostly wears her hair down with styled hair ornaments and veils, but after becoming Suleiman's legal wife and the Haseki Sultan, she begins to style it up to enhance the crowns and tiaras she begins to wear. Her beauty is a significant rival to Mahidevran Sultan.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe actress who plays Hürrem Sultan until Episode 101 is Meryem Uzerli.\n\nThe actress who plays Hürrem Sultan after Episode 101 is Vahide Perçin.\n\nReligion[]\n\nHürrem Sultan was raised in the Orthodox Christian faith in Ruthenia, seeing as her father was her village's priest. When she was abducted from her home and installed in Sultan Suleiman's harem, she still relied on her Orthodox Christian faith for comfort. After growing closer to the sultan and falling in love with him, Hürrem decides she wants to convert to Islam to be closer to him. The sultan is flattered, and complies immediately. After praying with him, and vowing to believe only in Allah, Hürrem is made a Sunni Muslim. After her conversion, she is often seen wearing veils when travelling, in the presence of men, and at formal events."
