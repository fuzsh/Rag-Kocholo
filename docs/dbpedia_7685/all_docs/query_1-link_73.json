        "text": "Hi! Thank you very much!\n\nHümaşah Sultan was Şehzade Mehmed’s (maybe) posthumous daughter, possibly born in 1543. The name of her mother is unknown but she certainly survived Mehmed because she was housed in the Old Palace after his death. Alderson calls her Aya, but gives no source for that information. Hümaşah was greatly loved by both Süleyman and Hürrem, who were deeply interested in her upbringing.\n\nshe firstly married Dâmâd Mehmed Ferhâd Paşa in 1566 and had several children with him: Sultanzade Haci Paşa (d. 1627), Sultanzade Hasan Bey (1571-1626 or 10.1630), Sultanzade Hüsni Bey, Sultanzade Ibrahim (Şehit) Bey (d. 1601 or 1602), Sultanzade Mustafa Paşa (1569-1593), Sultanzade Osman (Şehit) Bey (d. 1630), Sultanzade Süleyman Bey, Fatma Hanimsultan (actually referred to as Fatma Sultan in Privy Purse Registers) (1567-29.7.1588), who married one Mehmed Bey (d. 1586), and four other daughters, who probably died in infancy. It is possible that some of those children were twins.\n\nshe secondly married Dâmâd Sokolluzâde Lala Mustafa Paşa on 25.8.1575 and with him she had Sultânzâde Sokolluzâde ‘Abdülbâkî Bey.\n\nshe thirdly married Dâmâd Gaazî Mehmed Paşa in 1581, who died in 1592.\n\nHümaşah Sultan probably died in 1582 and was buried, with all her children, in the Şehzade Mosque, next to her father.\n\nAyşe Hümaşah Hanımsultan (1541-1594) was the daughter of Mihrimah Sultan and Grand Vizier Rüstem Paşa. She was actually accorded the title of Sultan, due to her mother’s social standing. Her descendants were called Mihrümah Sultanzadeler, because their status derived from their mother and not from their father.\n\nshe firstly married Grand Vizier Semiz Ahmed Paşa probably in 1557. With him she had: Sultanzade Hakani Mehmed Bey (d. 1593), Sultanzade Mustafa Şehid Paşa (d. 20.6.1593), Sultanzade Osman Bey (d. 1591). Ahmed Paşa died in 1580.\n\nshe secondly married Ahmed Ferîdûn Paşa, more famously known as Nişâncı Ferîdûn Bey, inside the palace of Ibrahim Paşa in 1582. The Paşa died in 1583.\n\nshe thirdly married Şeyh ‘Azîz Mahmûd Hüdâyî Efendi in 1583. He was a famous poer, composer and sufi follower."
