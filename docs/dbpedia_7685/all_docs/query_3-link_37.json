        "text": "Anonymous asked:\n\nWhy is The relationship between Cihangir and Mustafa colored by many legends, when the reality is quite different. Mustafa left Istanbul in 1533, when Cihangir was still an infant. Later, no interaction was known between the two princes. Cihangir never visited Mustafa in his princely province, and there is no evidence that any letter was ever exchanged. Based on the evidences, there was no connection between the two princes, so they probably never stood close together.\n\nSo, I have done some digging (instead of studying, so you'll tell my professor that on the day of my exam) and I think I have found something interesting. In Relazioni degli ambasciatori veneti al senato collected by Alberi, there's a Relazione Anonima (anonymous report) which talks about the war against Iran in 1553 and therefore Mustafa's execution as well. This is what it says about Cihangir:\n\nWith the Gran Signore was always Sultan Gengir, fifth-born, hunchbacked and much loved by his father, who - after sultan Mustafa's death - wanted to give him the sanjak of Amasya, where [Mustafa] had lived, but Gengir refused, saying that he did not want to leave his father's presence until he died at his feet, as happened later.\n\nthe author goes on saying that Cihangir also hoped that by staying right next to his father, should Süleyman die, he was in the perfect position to assume control of the empire... which I don't know whether it is true or not.\n\n“It was said that he incredibly mourned the end of his brother Mustafa, and that when he received the news he was about to give himself death by his own hand, which is very hard to believe because not only is life very dear [...] but with the death of his brother there was a great hope for him of ruling this great empire.”\n\nThe author also said that Selim, who was near Süleyman's camp, was summoned by his father several times but he did not move because he was afraid he would meet Mustafa's end. He only obeyed when things seemed to have calmed down.\n\nAbout Cihangir's actual death, he says:\n\n“On the 29th of that month sultan Gengir died. His ailment was a fast one, which ended him in four days; and because his condition was not known outside the serraglio, when the news of his death came out, it was believed that the Gran Signore had died, and this news spread so that it was believed in different parts of the city, where in some places sackings had begun.”\n\nSo while he says that Cihangir mourned Mustafa's execution, his death seems to have nothing to do with him. It was an ailment which was most probably linked to his condition. It is interesting that he says that no one knew - outside Topkapi - that Cihangir was disabled so his death came as a shock to people. Maybe this is why his death gets connected to Mustafa's?\n\nI have tried to find more reports of Mustafa's execution.\n\nUnfortunately, the Venetian ambassador to Istanbul at that time - Domenico Trevisan - in his relazione refers back to his dispacci which are not published, though, so... that's disappointing. He literally says that he has already talked about Mustafa's execution at length and therefore will not repeat things he has already said. That's just the most disappointing things I have ever read, personally.\n\nOgier Ghiselin de Busbecq was the Austrian ambassador from 1554 to 1562 so technically he was not a witness of Mustafa's execution. I could not find a translation of his letters in a language I know but I did find The Life and Letters of Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq; unfortunately, it does not mention Cihangir (though it perpetuates the myth that Hürrem asked Süleyman to execute Mustafa's son... sigh).\n\nThe French ambassador of the time was Gabriel d'Aramon. Interestingly, one of his secretaries - Jean Chesnau - wrote an account of his embassy: Le Voyage de Monsieur d'Aramon dans le Levant. Jean Chesnau says:\n\n“And from this death [Mustafa's] ensued that of Sultan Janguier Bassa, last son of the said Lord who died due to having seen his brother so cruelly treated. Others say that it was for a few words and threats that he told his father, and others that he was poisoned in a bath.”\n\nI think it's very interesting that he calls Cihangir a pasha? It could be a mistake, of course, but he doesn't call any of Süleyman's sons like that in the rest of his work.\n\nThis chronicle was annotated by M. Ch. Schefer in the XIX century, who says about this:\n\n\"Djihanguir did not stab himself on his brother's body as some historians claim. He died in Aleppo on November 29 1553, of pleurisy after four days of suffering, two months after the execution of his brother Sultan Mustafa.\"\n\nAnd indeed there are people who claim that Cihangir stabbed himself right after Mustafa's death: Michel de Codignac, French ambassador, for example.\n\n\"Then the Signore had his son Zangir the hunchback summoned, who did not know of these actions [Mustafa's execution], and ordered him to go see his brother who had come and was in the pavilion. Said hunchback, who arrived to embrace him, inside found the body of his poor brother strangled on the ground, and almost at the same time his father sent someone to tell him that he gifted him all the treasure that had been Mustafa's, with the pavilions and the province. The living brother replied: Ah wicked dog, traitor and not father. Let him enjoy Mustafa's treasures, pavilions and the province, because if he could find in his angry soul the reason to put to death such a virtuous son - and with such expectations, that no other like him the Ottoman house had or will ever have - God forbid he'll rejoice to do the same to me, miserable hunchback. And he pulled the dagger he had at his side and stuck it in his chest between the two humps, and immediately died. Having the King heard such an unexpected thing, he was greatly affected by it. And in truth this was the success of the Hunchback, although in order not to fill the world with ugliness, due to the reverence for the Ottoman house, the Turks say that he died of infirmity because he was ill.\" — Ruscelli, Lettere di Principi, tome I\n\nThis is the translation of a letter Michel de Codignac - who was not a witness and was not even the ambassador at that time - sent to the bishop of Lodève, who had become the French ambassador to Venice in 1555. The letter itself is marked 3 October 1553 but it is a mistake, according to Charrière in Négociations de la France dans le Levant:\n\n\"... the letter he [Ruscelli, author of Lettere di principi] gives written, or rather translated into Italian, appears to be a relation composed much later, and it is undoubtedly 1555 that we must read as the year, when M. de Lodève came to occupy the post in Venice. [...] In relating the incidents of [Mustafa's] death, [Codignac] gives circumstantial and very curious details, but which only concern the history of Turkey, and do not differ from those given on this subject by Turkish historians.\"\n\nThis is how far I was able to trace these claims.\n\nBasically from the aftermath of Mustafa's death rumours began to circulate that Cihangir had either a) cursed his father or b) greatly mourned Mustafa.\n\n(I think we can discount the reports that Cihangir died on Mustafa's same day because... well he was alive for two more months)\n\nWhile I can believe that Cihangir was affected by the execution, and the reasons could be several (among which the fact that his father had unexpectedly executed one of his sons), I do not believe that he told Süleyman that he was a \"wicked dog\" and a \"traitor\" or that his death was connected to Mustafa's.\n\nI think it's very interesting that the Relazione Anonima says that no one knew of Cihangir's weak health and therefore when he died people started to think that it was the sultan who had died (who, on the contrary, was rumoured to be in bad health—Mustafa himself knew that and was said to be waiting for the messenger to ride to Istanbul and take the throne). All the references to Süleyman being deeply affected by Cihangir's death of course come from the deep love that the sultan had for his youngest son and not from those words that de Codignac says Cihangir uttered.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nI was not able to trace back to the source of these claims but I am almost sure that Mustafa's entourage manipulated the narration in the aftermath of his execution. I could think of Yahya Efendi, who composed a eulogy in his honour and who blamed Rüstem right away. As he was someone very close to the prince, he was most probably considered a good source.\n\nFor my part, I found the Relazione Anonima very interesting because it gives away details almost... without noticing? (and these are the best sources) The author mentions the janissaries asking to go pay obésaince to Mustafa (which was forbidden) and Rüstem not allowing it because he knew that otherwise he would lose control of the army. He also mentions that they went anyway and that Mustafa treated them with honours, showering them with gifts; we can only speculate on why Mustafa decided to do that even though it was against protocol, but I think it was that that spurred Süleyman to action. We must never forget that he was a teenager when his father took the throne from Bayezid II; he witnessed the first coup d'état with the help of the Janissaries in Ottoman history. He probably thought that the same was going to happen to him.\n\nI am so sorry that your question got derailed LOL I just hope that I somehow managed to answer your question while I blabbed."
