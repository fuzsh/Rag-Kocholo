        "text": "This dissertation is an overview of the life and the career of Ottoman grand vizier Rüstem Pasha and contextualization of his grand vizierate with respect to foreign policy, bureaucratization and economic policies. This dissertation shows that beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was transformed from an expansive Muslim empire into a bureaucratic state and that Rüstem Pasha was the architect when he was acting its primary promoter and designer. The dissertation analyzes the religious and political reforms of Ottoman grand vizier Rüstem Pasha (1544-1561), which led the way for restructuring the empire and transforming it into an early modern bureaucratic state. It explores the stages of his life as a Christian boy who converted to Islam and was educated in the Ottoman palace and, after serving in several provincial governorships, attained the position of the grand vizierate. It also shows how his career was structured and enhanced through Ottoman educational institutions, as well as how he envisioned and enacted an institutionalized government system by creating new methods of record keeping in decision-making, and developing a record tracking system, as well as by standardizing career paths for officers. Having witnessed the inconclusive and draining wars with both the Safavid and the Habsburg empires, Rüstem Pasha abandoned the traditional universalist claims and engagement in gaza (holy raiding) activity, which had been the most conspicuous feature of Ottoman ideology since its inception in the fourteenth century, and instead adopted more peaceful relations with the empire’s neighbors. The dissertation also shows how he contributed to the spread of an orthodox Sunni Islam as faith and practice within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire and how he influenced the territorialization of Shiite Islam promoted by the Safavids in neighboring Iran. Signing peace agreements with the Safavids (1555) and the Habsburgs (1547) also enabled him to focus on the efficient use of internal resources by initiating new fiscal institutions to channel the economic resources into the central treasury.\n\nA full life and times biography of Süleyman, the longest reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Süleyman, who ruled the Ottoman Empire between 1520 and 1566, was a globally recognized figure during his lifetime. His domain extended from Hungary to Iran, and from the Crimea to North Africa and the Indian Ocean. The wealth of his treasury, the strength of his armies, and his personality were much discussed by historians, poets, courtiers, diplomats and publics across Eurasia. Süleyman was engaged in bitter rivalries with the Catholic Habsburgs in Europe and the Shiite Safavids in the Middle East. He presided over a multilingual and multireligious empire that promised peace and prosperity to its subjects. During his reign, the Ottoman Empire became a truly global power. Imperial governance expanded considerably, and the law was emphasized as the main bond between the ruler and the ruled. Süleyman's prolific poetic output, his frequent appearances during public ceremonies, his charity, and his patronage of arts and architecture enhanced his reputation as a universal ruler with a well-rounded character. Behind the public façade of might and glory, Süleyman led a complicated life. He grew up with an overbearing father whose legacy was both an advantage and a burden. Defying established practice, he married a concubine named Hürrem whose love and affection became a true refuge. Towards the end of his life, he had to overcome both debilitating sickness and the agitations of his sons to remain on the throne. Nearly half a millennium after his death, the life of Süleyman has been obscured by romanticized and exoticized narratives. Based on original sources in multiple languages, Peerless among Princes narrates Süleyman's achievements as well as his failures. What emerges is a compelling account of a ruler, his family, his close associates, and the Ottoman imperial project itself during the transformational sixteenth century.\n\nThis article examines the rise of the Köprülü grand viziers and their relationship with Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648-1687) within the context of broader developments in early modern Europe. It challenges the prevailing view that Mehmed IV was a weak Sultan, arguing that at a time of profound crisis the Sultan succeeded in creating a new political system, which simultaneously restored the authority of the Sultan whilst bolstering that of the Grand Vizier. It explores the various ways in which this system was established, from relocation of the dynastic seat to changes in recruitment networks. The reconfiguration of political power under Mehmed IV and the Köprülü viziers is approached through the lens of royal-favorite relationships in seventeenth-century Europe. Although there was no European equivalent of a number of elements in the Ottoman system, such as a harem-based court or the Grand Vizierate, we can nevertheless apply key concepts and debates gleaned from early modern Western and Central Europe-such as the politics of access and intimacy, the place of favorites, and the delegation of royal power-to enrich our understanding of the early modern Ottoman experience."
