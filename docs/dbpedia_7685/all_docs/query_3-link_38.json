        "text": "I’m pretty sure I have already talked about this so I hope I’m not repeating myself here but basically, that Kösem was Ahmed’s second-born son’s mother is said by various sources who were not in contact with each other (ie. they couldn’t have “copied” one another) therefore giving validity to the claim.\n\nThe main reasoning comes from The Debut of Kösem Sultan’s Political Career by Baki Tezcan\n\nPietro della Valle in 1614 — while in Istanbul — says that Kösem was the mother of Ahmed I’s second son. In another letter, in 1619, he talks about a “Prince Mahmud”, whom he refers to as Kösem’s eldest son. Mahmud is most probably a mistake for Mehmed (rather than Murad)\n\nGeorge Sandys in A Relation of a Journey begun an: dom: 1610 — most probably written in 1610 — affirms that Kösem was Ahmed I’s second-born son’s mother\n\nOttaviano Bon, the Venetian ambassador, writes in his report that in 1609 (or maybe earlier), Ahmed I has two sons and two daughters by three women (but that two sons have already died in infancy). Considering that Murad’s year of birth is 1612, the second son cannot be him. The two princes are clearly Osman and Mehmed\n\nSimone Contarini, Venetian ambassador, in 1612 states that Osman goes for carriage rides with the mother of the second-born son, who is called “queen”. That’s Kösem, as there was not a higher-ranking woman in the harem at that time.\n\nCristoforo Valier states that Ahmed has two sons with “the sultana alive”. As he died in July 1615 in Corfu while returning to Venice, he left Istanbul earlier than that. Clearly, though, he was there when Murad was born in July 1612, and this is why he says that Kösem’s sons are two.\n\nThis is only the stuff we get from official reports. Dispatches are shorter letters that the Venetian ambassadors routinely sent back to Venice and they could be more precise but they’re not published and not accessible (unless you physically go to the Archive of Venice)\n\nValier is used by Peirce (and others, I guess) as evidence that Mehmed cannot have been Kösem’s son but, I believe that she made a mistake when she translated the Italian original. This is what she said in The Imperial Harem:\n\nAs a small boy, Osman went for carriage rides with Kösem; he liked to make himself seen during these outings by casting coins to bystanders. Eventually Ahmed interfered with this relationship between his son and his haseki: the ambassador Valier reported in 1616 that the sultan did not allow the two eldest princes (Osman and Mehmed) to converse with Kösem. His motive perhaps, as Valier speculated, was fear that the princes’ security was threatened by Kösem’s well-known ambitions for her own sons.\n\nThe problem with this interpretation is that Valier doesn’t say “the two eldest princes” but Osman and his younger brother (because, as he had said at the beginning of the paragraph, Ahmed has “two sons with the living sultana and two with the sultana who died”):\n\n“… parendo che il Re non lo lasci conversare con la sultana vivente, siccome né anco il fratello minore, stimando forse che siano più sicuri lontani da lei, tanto riesce sospetta l’emulazione dell’impero […]” // It seems that the King won’t let him, or his younger brother, converse with the living sultana, maybe thinking that they’re safer far from her, her ambitions to rule known.\n\nSo yeah. Personally, I’m quite sure that Kösem was Mehmed’s mother. She is consistently identified like that in contemporary sources (not only Venetian but English and most probably French too) but, for some reason, modern historians discarded them.\n\nAs for why she is not mentioned in relation to Mehmed’s execution. Well… we don’t really know if she wasn’t. I’m pretty sure that Giustinian’s dispatches mention Mehmed’s execution and maybe Kösem’s reaction to it— I haven’t read them, though, and when I last went to my uni library I deliberately skipped his official report because I’m an idiot."
