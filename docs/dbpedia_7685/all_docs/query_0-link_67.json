He was also fluent in languages such as Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, Serbian, Farsi, Urdu, and more. He admired Alexander the Great in his youth, and later on, his actions were inspired by him.\n\nAccession\n\nWhen he was 26 years old, in 1520, his father Selim I died and he ascended to the throne as the tenth Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. His mother, Hafsa Sultan served as a coregent. He started his plan of military conquest. During his reign, his army conquered parts of Hungary and Romania.\n\nConquests\n\nSuleiman started preparations for the Conquest of Belgrade from the Kingdom of Hungary, which fell in August 1521, and Rhodes in 1522, forcing the Knights of St. John to leave Malta. His conquests continued swiftly with Buda (Budin) in 1529, and Vienna in the same year, Transylvania in 1562. His domain extended to the eastward and into Egypt and Persia.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nSuleiman the Magnificent had 2 known consorts, which are Mahidevran and Hurrem Sultan who was known as Suleiman’s favorite.

The Ottomans won the battle on September 8, 1566, but Suleiman the Magnificent died because of a heart attack on the previous day. His death was kept as a secret for a month. His body was prepared to transport Constantinople. To protect it from corruption, his heart and the other organs were removed and also buried in Hungary. He was a loved Sultan by his people."
