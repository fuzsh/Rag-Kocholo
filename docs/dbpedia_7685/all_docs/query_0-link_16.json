        "text": "Mihrimah Sultan Ottoman princes, daughter of Sultan Suleiman\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 ·\n\nMihrimah Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: مهرماه سلطان, \"sun and moon\" or \"light of the moon\", 19 March 1523 – 25 January 1578) was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent and his wife, Hürrem Sultan. She was the most powerful imperial princess in Ottoman history according to historian Mustafa Selaniki who described her as the greatest and most respected princess and a prominent figure in the so-called Sultanate of Women. In Europe she was known as Sultana Cameria, while in Constantinople she was known as Büyük Sultan (the Great Sultana).\n\n16th-century women of the Ottoman Empire · 25T\n\n16th-century Ottoman royalty · 29T\n\nDaughters of Ottoman sultans · 74T\n\nŞehzade Mustafa Prince-Governer of Manisa\n\n0 0\n\nrank #2 ·\n\nŞehzade Mustafa (Ottoman Turkish: شهزاده مصطفى‎; 6 August 1515 – 6 October 1553) was an Ottoman prince and the son of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his concubine Mahidevran Hatun. He was the governor of Manisa from 1532 to 1542, of Amasya from 1542 to 1549, and of Konya from 1549 to 1553, when he was executed by his father's order.\n\nSons of Ottoman sultans · 23T\n\nOttoman princes · 27T\n\n16th-century executions by the Ottoman Empire · 25T\n\nSelim II 11th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1566 to 1574\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nSelim II (Ottoman Turkish: سليم ثانى Selīm-i sānī, Turkish: II. Selim; 28 May 1524 – 15 December 1574), also known as Selim the Blond (Turkish: Sarı Selim) or Selim the Drunk (Turkish: Sarhoş Selim), was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1566 until his death in 1574. He was a son of Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Hurrem Sultan. Selim had been an unlikely candidate for the throne until his brother Mehmed died of smallpox, his half-brother Mustafa was strangled to death by the order of his father, his brother Cihangir succumbed to chronic health issues, and his brother Bayezid was killed on the order of his father after a rebellion against Selim. Selim died on 15 December 1574 and was buried in Hagia Sophia.\n\nOttoman caliphs · 7T\n\nBurials at Hagia Sophia · 18T\n\nRoyalty from Istanbul · 96T\n\nRaziye Sultan Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nTasasız Raziye Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: راضیہ سلطان; 'carefree' and 'acceptance, submission') was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and an unknown concubine. According to Leslie P. Peirce, she was probably the princess who died in 1520 along with her half brothers Şehzade Mahmud and Şehzade Murad of an infectious disease, perhaps of smallpox. However, according to Hüseyin Husâmeddin Yasar's book Amasya Tarihi, Raziye was the daughter of Şehzade Mustafa. She is buried at the Yahya Efendi's Tekke in Beşiktaş, Istanbul.\n\nŞehzade Abdullah Ottoman prince, son of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nŞehzade Abdullah (c. 1525 – c. 1528) was an Ottoman prince (şehzade), as the son of Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and of Hurrem Sultan, as Suleiman and Hurrem were in a monogamous relationship by the time of his birth. He was born around 1525 in Topkapi Palace, the Ottoman Empire and died due to a disease, possibly smallpox, in Constantinople, around 1528."
