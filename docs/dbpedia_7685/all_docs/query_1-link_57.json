        "text": "The Gilded Cage on the Bosphorus\n\nThe Ottomans : The Story of a Family\n\nMy next two posts will be about Murad V‘s grandchildren. At the time in which the book is set, Murad V had two grandsons and five granddaughters. They were all the children of his only son, Prince Mehmed Selahaddin. This post on Sultan Murad’s grandsons, Prince Ahmed Nihad and Prince Osman Fuad, will reveal how very different in character the two brothers were.\n\nHis Imperial Highness Prince Ahmed Nihad\n\nChildhood\n\nPrince Nihad was the eldest son of Prince Mehmed Selahaddin and his wife, the Lady Naziknaz. He was born in confinement at the Çırağan Palace on 5th July 1883, making him twenty years old at the beginning of the novel.\n\nNihad’s father, Selahaddin, was his everything – not only his father, but also his tutor, his confidant and his closest friend. His mother, Naziknaz, adored her only son, and showered him with love and affection. Yet, Nihad’s childhood was lonely, monotonous, and frustratingly restricted.\n\nI have four sons, alhamdulillah! They all enjoy interacting with each other and with their friends. They love school and sport. And as young children they certainly all had fun running around together and getting into mischief! Sadly this was denied to Nihad. He spent his entire childhood in confinement; held as a prisoner of a paranoid sultan. He never played with another little boy, in fact he never even saw another little boy! His only playmates were his younger aunts and his sisters. He literally had no interaction whatsoever with a child who was not a member of his immediate family. And this scarred him for life…\n\nAppearance and Character\n\nNihad was dashingly handsome. He had thick dark hair, piercing grey eyes, a well-groomed moustache, and was always immaculately dressed. His manners were impeccable, he was intelligent, curious and creative. He was also modest, humble and self-disciplined.\n\nIn many ways he was the epitome of a modern prince. Nihad was exceptionally well read, extremely interested in current affairs and was an advocate of liberal constitutional reform. He was deeply religious, had a keen and focused sense of duty and responsibility, and held traditional values and customs in high esteem. Nihad was very interested in all the latest inventions and technological advances that were being made at the time, and was himself a skilled carpenter and craftsman. He was also a gifted composer and talented pianist.\n\nHowever, he was not at all sporty and did not enjoy physical activity. Nihad was reserved, controlled, a perfectionist and perhaps a little judgemental of others who did not measure up to his exceedingly high standards and expectations. He found it hard to relax, to laugh, to have fun, and was often teased by other members of the family for being overly serious.\n\nNihad : As Portrayed in ‘The Gilded Cage on the Bosphorus’\n\nNihad is one of the central characters of the story. We first meet him when he visits his wife, the Lady Safiru, immediately after she has given birth to their son – my grandfather. It is one of the few scenes in the book where he lets down his guard and we see the softer side of his nature.\n\nHowever, the central theme of his character is that Nihad is a young man who harbours a dream. The dream of being free so that he may serve his empire and help save it from the imperialist western powers who threaten all he holds dear. He believes that the only way to do this is if the Empire introduces a drastic programme of liberal constitutional reform.\n\n‘Nihad could not help but admire the resilience and strength of will Abdülhamid had shown in carrying out his mission. His dedication to duty and enormous capacity for work were undeniable, as was his unmatched skill in the art of diplomacy …… Where Nihad found Abdülhamid wanting, however, was in his failure to accept that there was no longer any place for autocratic rule in the modern world. Nihad dearly wished that the Padishah would see this truth and, having met some of the ministers and government officials from the Sublime Porte that day, he felt inspired to push for the realisation of his grandfather’s dream of parliamentary democracy.’\n\nMy great-grandfather never gave up on this dream. The dream of seeing the Ottoman Empire ruled by a parliamentary democracy under the auspices of a constitutional monarchy. But, fate can be cruel…\n\nHis Imperial Highness Prince Osman Fuad\n\nPrince Fuad was the youngest son of Prince Mehmed Salahaddin and the only child of his wife, the Lady Jalefer. He was born on 24th September 1895, also at the Çırağan Palace. Also during the long years that Sultan Murad’s family were held in confinement there.\n\nHe is eight years old at the start of my story. A fun-loving, vibrant, energetic little boy. He was very different in character to his elder brother. Not at all serious or interested in his studies, but always on the hunt for adventure and excitement!\n\nFuad : As Portrayed in ‘The Gilded Cage on the Bosphorus’\n\nKnowing what I know about the character of my great-uncle, I have based my portrayal of him as a little boy on my own sons. He is mischievous, cheeky and excitable. He is overly enthusiastic, fiercely competitive but also loving and completely and utterly adorable.\n\nFuad brings light-hearted relief to the story. He very much reminds the reader that even though the characters are members of the Imperial Ottoman family, they are still just a family. A family, who like all others, have feelings and sensitivities, hopes and dreams… And Fuad has big dreams of adventure…\n\n‘Slowly, Murad and Fatma headed back towards the harem building; before going inside, however, they paused for a while on the terrace where Selahaddin and Fuad were playing backgammon. They stood and watched a few throws of the dice; then Murad suggested a move to Fuad that his grandson had failed to see.\n\n“You play very well, Fuad, but make sure you do not take unnecessary risks that your opponent can then take advantage of,” Murad said. “Always protect your pieces when you can, and do not risk losing them needlessly. A game of backgammon is like an encounter on the battlefield. It is a game of strategy as well as one of luck, and so like all good generals you must value every one of your men.”\n\n“Thank you, Grandfather. I will remember your advice – not just when I am playing backgammon, but when I am leading my men into battle, too” replied the young boy.’"
