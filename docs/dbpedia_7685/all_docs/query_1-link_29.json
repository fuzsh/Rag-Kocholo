        "text": "Early life\n\nÅehzade Mehmed Abdulaziz was born on 26 September 1901 in the OrtakÃ¶y Palace. His father was Åehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin, son of Sultan Abdulaziz and Gevheri KadÄ±n, and his mother was NeÅefelek HanÄ±m. He was the eldest child of his father and the only child of his mother. He had two younger half-brothers Åehzade Mahmud Åevket and Åehzade Ahmed Tevhid and a younger half-sister Fatma Gevheri Sultan.[1] He was educated at the Ottoman Military College.[2]\n\nAt the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Abdulaziz and his family moved to Cimiez, Nice, France. They bought a villa near the Villa Carabacel which belonged to Seniha Sultan, daughter of Sultan Abdulmejid I.[3] Here his father died in 1927.[1] Abdulaziz then settled in Cairo, Egypt.[4]\n\nPersonal life\n\nMehmed Abdulaziz's only wife was Berkemal HanÄ±m. She was the eldest daughter of Ali Reza Bey of the YeÄen family and wife Nimet HanÄ±m.[5] She was born on 16 March 1911 in Cairo, Egypt. They married on 21 February 1929 in Cairo, Egypt. The two together had one daughter, HÃ¼rrem Sultan, born on 31 December 1939. Berkemal died on 13 January 1962.[1] Her third youngest sister, Nafia HanÄ±m, was married to Mehmed Orhan, 42nd head of the Ottoman dynasty from 1983 to 1994, and was the mother of Fatma Necla Sultan.[5]\n\nLater life and death\n\nAhmed Nihad became the head of the exiled Imperial family in August 1944, following the death of Abdulmejid II. But Åehzade Ãmer Faruk did not accepted him as head of the family. On the other hand his wife Sabiha Sultan backed the council's decision and approved the choice of leader. On this occasion Mehmed Abdulaziz, and his cousins ÅÃ¼kriye Sultan, and MihriÅah Sultan, sided with Ãmer Faruk.[3]\n\nAfter the Egyptian revolution of 1952, President Gamal Abdel Nasser expelled him from Egypt, after his refusal to accepted Egypt's identity law. He then went to Nice, France with the help of the then president of France Charles de Gaulle, who gave him French passport. He was also given a monthly salary of fifty thousand francs.[4]\n\nIn 1973, after the death of Osman Fuad, he became the 40th head of the Ottoman dynasty.[6] He died on 19 January 1977 in Nice, France and was buried there,[1] and was buried in East Side cemetery in Nice.[7]"
