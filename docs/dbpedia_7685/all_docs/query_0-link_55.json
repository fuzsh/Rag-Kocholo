        "text": "This is more of my own thoughts and theories rather facts that can be disputed any time.\n\nIn the tv show, as well as in real life, I got the impression that our Bayezid was not the smartest guy out there. He himself seemed to be aware of this too. Impatient, unloved (according to the series), thirsty for some action. Some action did happen in the end, as we know. Why? Because he decided to resolve the issue of two heirs present before the appropriate time.\n\nIt was never mentioned anywhere in historical texts that Bayezid got the idea of rebelling from his grandfather, Selim I. However, when talking about Mustafa, it usually says that the regular army saw him as his reborn grandad, ready for some good wars and more blood. In the show, Selim’s persona seems to be very valuable, especially when talking about the concept of overthrowing - the word nobody ever dared to say in the series, but what was the real meaning behind all those talks. Overthrowing, winning the throne with blood of your own family. It would be like that any way, but still. In the show again, Bayezid got really obsessed with Selim’s success, referring to him any time discussions about a possible battle would come up. So, let’s assume both the in-show and real life Bayezid decided to repeat their grandfather’s feats and defeat all da enemies Selim I style. The exact reason of why this idea proves Bayezid was too dumb to ever take over the throne.\n\nLet’s see, in short, what did exactly happen during Selim’s rebellion? Everything started with the fact that, even if Selim was his father sultan Bayezid II’s elder son, Bayezid II had a strong and what it seems a quite open preference to his younger son Ahmet. I guess this preference was so in your face the fact that he was going to make Ahmet the next sultan was too evident not to worry. Fearing for his backside, Selim decided to take action.\n\nAnd his decision was so brutal Selim went for the hardcore, gathering a tiny-miny army and going straight to goddamn Istanbul to fight no other but his own father, the current sultan. Maybe Selim was hoping for other rebels to join him in the capital, maybe he thought he would be more popular than his ageing father - anyhow, everything went terribly wrong. Bayezid’s army was huge and he had easily defeated his son. However, Selim escaped to Crimea, a place hard to get into for the Ottoman Empire. Bayezid feared that Selim might gather some serious forces there that will suck him into some even more serious wars and other territorial complications. So serious that one day Bayezid stepped down, willingly passing the throne over to Selim. Yes, he just stepped down.\n\nThen Selim executed all possible male heirs and Bayezid himself “suddenly” passed away a month later. Thus, Selim I appeared and made his bloody entrance.\n\nLooking at this story, it might not be suprising that our Şehzade Bayezid found a great resemblance between Selim’s adventures and his own. Both had potentially dangerous brothers that clearly had better chances for the throne. But maybe Bayezid thought that his situation had more advantage, since his brother Selim was unpopular, and since Bayezid wasn’t going to nuke his own father - it’s just Selim alone.\n\nFrom this point now on I had the impression that Bayezid no longer had any idea of what he was doing. From his and Suleyman’s correspondence while Bayezid was already hiding in Persia, it is evident that he wasn’t planning to rebel against his father, he says so himself. Here, his logic chain evaporates.\n\nWhat was he planning to do going against Selim? No, change the question: how does Suleyman suppose to act when his son gathers an army to kill the other son? Did Bayezid think Suleyman would be just watching them fight and let the winner peacefully take the cake? It seems so, because it looks like Bayezid didn’t see Suleyman supporting his loyal son Selim with an army coming. This was one of the biggest mistakes he made, as now, obviously, Bayezid is considered an enemy of the Ottoman Empire as he pretty much went against the current ruling power. There was no team Selim and team Suleyman seperately, and rebelling against one of the royal family’s representatives means Bayezid was turned against all the Ottoman forces.\n\nAnd let us consider this, that, unlike Bayezid II, Suleyman I is the goddamn Suleyman I, the sultan that brought Turkey to its peak. You think Bayezid II’s army was bad, hoho, let’s think about how huge the army was NOW. Of course Şehzade Bayezid’s army was destroyed, and he fled to Persia, but unlike his grandfather Selim I, he fled for a hideout, not for a powerful place that was capable of going into a war with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nYou know the rest of the story, bargaining was secretly taking place, finally they agreed on the price, Bayezid became a prisoner, by the time the representative who described this whole situation got to his cell, Bayezid was so filthy and covered in hair they had to shave him to make sure it was actually him. Then he got executed, and for some reason, the execution of his sons was delayed by one more year. Happy end.\n\nSo, if Bayezid did follow his grandfather’s example, it was a very bad decision. Maybe Selim I was the local hero we all deserve and his campaign might’ve been impressive. However, you are forgeting about something, Bayezid. About turning pages a little bit back.\n\nThat Bayezid II was one of a loser, right? Gave everything in for all his children to die and followed after them himself a month later. Do you think this is all you need to know about sultan Bayezid II, Şehzade Bayezid?\n\nYou were named after him, you know. Let me tell you a story. Bayezid’s father was no other but Mehmet II, the Conqueror of Constantonople, today’s Istanbul, the creator of Fatih’s law, the very one that stated once a sultan takes over, he has to execute all other male heirs in order to prevent possible wars. Nothing out of the ordinary, it seems, dad like a dad. By the end of his days, Mehmet had two sons: our Bayezid and Cem (pronounced like Jam), from another woman. Mehmet was giving more than subtle hints about wanting Cem to take over the throne. Worse, for European leaders that were applying Constantinople’s law to the Empire, a legitimate heir is the child who was born after his father was already crowned. Bayezid wasn’t one of them. Cem was. Add to it the fresh Fatih’s law about executing all the males. And finish the dish with the fact that both Bayezid and Cem had an equal number of followers, both were equally popular and supported, but Cem had the Grand Vizier on his side, the vizier that was trying to gather more people for his potential sultan, since you know, Mehmet II wanted so. Mehmet himself “suddenly” died once upon a time, and the poopstorm has begun.\n\nThe situation was complicated, but Bayezid didn’t care. A Grand Vizier, you say? That guy got captured, and you can guess what happened to him next. However, a battle was inevitable, and when it did happen, Cem actually won. But suddenly, BROTHERLY LOVE kicked in. Cem said that no matter what he wants to divide the Empire between the brothers, earning some very intense stares from many of his army men and generals. What the hell are we battling for here? This ambition didn’t get Cem very far, and when the next battle happened, he got betrayed by his own general, lost, and fled to Egypt. There it appeared that Bayezid got hold of the majority of Turkish army, so a comeback was impossible, and Cem had the misfortune of becoming a hostage.\n\nHere starts the fun part, since the Catholic world got interested in this situation. Cem was a precious hostage. No matter what, Bayezid did love his brother *long sigh* and wanted to get him back to execute and bury him as sultan’s son deserves. If all those powers let Cem free, they might dump him literally anywhere, allowing him to gather forces to go against Bayezid once again. Bayezid wanted Cem on his territory, he was no danger there, but nobody would provide him such luxury. The conditions of the trade were crazy for Bayezid. He couldn’t agree to give away important locations and huge sums of money, but while Cem was still a hostage, he also couldn’t set up any war campaigns, since once again, free Cem was capable of starting the war all over again. This was a win-win situation for Europe. In the worst case, blood thirsty Bayezid doesn’t attack anybody, Europe is safe. In the best case, he agrees to the bargain and not only pays a fortune for Cem, but also gives away huge chuncks of land. Of course keeping Cem a hostage was very beneficial.\n\nThe trade lasted for six whole years from 1489 to 1495 while all those popes and kings were setting the price for Cem. Cem himself was transported from Egypt to France and then to Rome, and was held as a prisoner alongside his family. Finally, Bayezid agreed to pay this fortune and give away Neapol for his brother, but on his way home Cem “suddenly” died. After that it took Bayezid another four years to get Cem’s ashes back to Turkey and bury him properly. He even declared a mourning day after him. Brother logic, I guess.\n\nSo, why is this whole story so important? Because I think that if to follow anyone’s example, it should’ve been Bayezid’s.\n\nVirtually, you don’t have to follow anyone. You don’t have to listen to me and my excellent advices told 500 years later than needed. There’s only one thing our Şehzade Bayezid could’ve found useful from this story, the advice that seemed so hard for him to follow - wait until your father dies.\n\nThis is practically the key to his success, and the failure to sit and just damn wait costed Bayezid his own life. Of course after Mustafa’s execution nothing could’ve been certain. Everybody knew Suleyman was capable of killing off anyone if he wanted. This fear was probably the primary factor that pushed Bayezid into a rebellion and ultimately - to his death. But anyhow, how waiting and Bayezid II’s story are linked?\n\nCem was a difficult rival. Cem was as popular as his brother was, and if not for his brotherly love, he could’ve taken over the throne. He won the first battle already, and turned everything into dust with the power of his own tongue. Cem had everything, even the support of the Grand Vizier. But Bayezid managed to, slowly, but eliminate him.\n\nLet’s look at Şehzade Bayezid and Selim. Was Selim popular? I can safely say this is the only factor that could’ve mattered if Suleyman died with both sons alive at the time. It was Bayezid who was seen as second Mustafa by the regular army. He was supported by common people. He had the power. He knew he had that power, without it he wouldn’t rise up in the first place. What would Selim have when his father’s protection was no longer there? Possible support by, huh, the Grand Vizier and other politicians? I think we already know how this situation can be handled. If only Bayezid waited, there wouldn’t have been even a war. Selim is not Cem. This race would’ve been a short one. And by the time Bayezid’s sons were executed, Suleyman had only three years left to live. Three years! Was it that difficult to wait for three more years? Was everything that happened worth it?\n\nSo yes, maybe Bayezid was a skilled warrior, but it’s never enough to battle for the throne. His great grandfather practically showed him a difficult path to victory, a path that would’ve been much easier in Bayezid’s situation, but no. No matter if he indeed followed Selim I or his own plans, everything in the end has failed miserably, and all because somebody was too cool to goddamn wait."
