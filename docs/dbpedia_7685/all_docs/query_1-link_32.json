He was born with deformations and during his short life he became the closest compagnion of the sultan.\n\nGülfem Hatun: Despite the folclore she was not the wife of Sultan Sulieman, and was not the mother of his children, but most probably was a high-ranking harem steward, who was very close to both Hürrem and Suleiman.\n\nSelim II: Son of Suleiman I, who followed him on the throne. He usually remembered as a drunk, but he was certanly more than that. He is an underrated Sultan.\n\nNurbanu Sultan: Haseki and wife of Selim II, and mother of Murad III. She was the first Valide Sultan who was deeply involved politics so do as the next valide sultanas after her.\n\nDaughters of Selim II: Selim had four daughters, Esmehan, Gevherhan, Şah and Fatma, among whom Esmehan and Gevherhan became very influental women of their time.\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha: One of the most famous and most briliant grand veziers of the Ottoman Empire.

She was one of the shortest reigned Valide Sultanas of the Ottoman Empire, due to her early death.\n\nDaughters of Mehmed III: Mehmed III’s harem is one of the worst documented in the history of the Ottoman Empire. Mehmed has only a few daughters known, but we know little about them as well, and it is impossible to establish with certainty who the mother of these girls was.\n\nAhmed I: The first Sultan who ascended the throne withouth previously ruling in a princely province. He ascended young, unexperienced, uncircumsized but in the end the became a loved Sultan, the builder of the Blue Msoque.\n\nMahfiruze Hatun: She was the mother of Osman II, but she died before her son would ascend the throne. Her short life is very badly documented.\n\nKösem Sultan: Kösem Sultan was the sultana who broke the highest, who could have been at the top for a long time, but from the great heights, she finally fell down and became the only murdered valide sultana ever. She had several titles during her life: Naib-i Sultanat (regent of the Ottoman Empire), Umin al-Mu'minin (mother of all muslims), Büyük Valide Sultan (great Valide Sultan), Valide-i Sehide (martyred mother), Valide-i Maktule (murdered mother), Valide-i Muazzama (magnificent mother).\n\nDaughters of Ahmed I: Most sons of Sultan Ahmed I were born to his favorite, Kösem Sultan but his daughters are more divided. Of Ahmed’s roughly ten daughters (Gevherhan, Atike, Abide, Hatice, Esma, Zahide…), only three were born from Kösem (Ayşe, Fatma, Hanzade).\n\nOsman II: Osman II was the first sultan who fell victim of regricide in the hitory of Ottoman Empire.\n\nOsman II’s consorts: Osman II in his short life and reign had a Haseki Sultan, had a simple consort and had a legal wife (maybe two legal wives).\n\nMustafa I: Sultan Mustafa I was the first sultan who ascended the throne as the brother of the former padisah and not his son. He was mentally instable but not hamrful.\n\nSons of Ahmed I: This series of portraits do not include the three sons of Ahmed I, who later became sultans (Osman II, Murad IV, and Ibrahim I). Separate portraits have been or will be published for them.\n\nMurad IV: Although Murad was not perfect, he performed many cruel deeds, yet after decades he was the first sultan to conquer and he was the one who successfully restored the peace of the empire for which the people loved him.\n\nConsorts of Murad IV: We know quite little about Murad IV’s personal life and harem, who his children were who were their mothers. But there are two Hasekies (Ayşe and the second Haseki) who we know and another women, Sanavber Hatun.\n\nDaughters of Murad IV: Murad IV’s most well known daughter is Kaya Esmehan, however she was not the only daughter of his.\n\nIbrahim I: Ibrahim I was a crazy ruler and the second victim of regricide. His reign was weightless and short, though there are endless legends about his crazy personality.\n\nIbrahim I’s consorts: When Ibrahim I ascended the throne, the Ottoman Empire suffered from an inheritance problem, so it was very urgent for the Sultan to produce children as soon as possible so in the end he had 8 hasekies.\n\nIbrahim I’s daughters: Ibrahim I had several daughters, but none of them became really famous as his sisters did for example.\n\nTurhan Hatice: She was the Valide Sultan with the longest tenure (34 years) and she was the last female regent of the empire.\n\nMehmed IV: He was the youngest sultan sitting on the Ottoman throne and sultan with one of the longest reigns. He is well known for his travels and hunting trips.\n\nMehmed IV’s consorts: Mehmed IV had a main consort who we all know - Emetullah Rabia Gülnüş - but he had some other women in his life also.\n\nMehmed IV’s daughters: Mehmed had at least five daughters but only three/four reached adulthood."
