        "text": "ottomanladies answered:\n\nConsorts:\n\nAyşe Hatun (?? - 1512?): daughter of Alâüddevle Bozkurt Bey of the Dulkadir dynasty and possibly niece of Sitti Mukrime Hatun (consort of Mehmed II). She is usually given as mother of Selim I, but she was not. According to Alderson, she died in 1512.\n\nBülbül Hatun (?? - 1515): mother of Şehzade Ahmed and Hundi Sultan. She was a very charitable person, building a mosque complex in Ladik, another mosque, school and fountain in Amasya and a school in Bursa. When her son was executed by Selim I, she retired to Bursa where she built a tomb for him. She is buried next to her son.\n\nFerahşad Hatun (?? - after 1521): Şehzade Mehmed’s mother, she is variously called Ferruhşad or Muhterem. It is possible that her whole name was Muhterem Ferruhşad. Upon the death of her son in 1505, she retired to Bursa like it was customary for the mother of a deceased prince. She established a foundation in Silivri n 1521, so she must have died later.\n\nHüsnüşah Hatun (?? - after 1511): mother of Şehzade Şehinşah and Sultanzade. She followed her son first to Manisa and then to Konya. After Şehzade Şehinşah died, she settled in Bursa where she eventually died. She had built the Hatuniye Mosque in 1490 in Manisa during her son’s governorship there. She wrote to Selim I on behalf of Mevlana Pir Ahmed Celebi, one of Şehzade Şehinşah’s men who had not received a new post after the prince’s death.\n\n(Ayşe) Gülbahar Hatun (?? - 1505): mother of Selim I, she was a slave concubine and not a highborn princess as tradition maintains. She died in Trabzon during her son’s princely post and she was buried in the Hatuniye Tomb there.\n\nGülruh Hatun (?? - after 1520): mother of Şehzade Alemşah and Kamer Sultan. During the reign of Bayezid II, she used to correspond with him about their son: “My fortune-favored padishah, heed my cry for help, … rid us of [my son’s] tutor, teacher, and doctor. They are masters of corruption…. Send us good Muslims because our situation has been pitiful since these persons arrived. They have deprived me of my mother’s rights…. If these seven do not go, they will utterly destroy the household of my son, your servant”. Alemşah would die because of heavy drinking, and Gülruh Hatun retired to Bursa. She died in the early days of Süleyman the Magnificent’s reign and was buried in the Gülruh Hatun Tomb in the Muradiye Mosque.\n\nNigar Hatun (?? - 1503): according to Uluçay and Oztuna, she was the mother of Şehzade Korkut and Fatma Sultan. She followed her son first in Manisa and then in Antalya, where she died and was buried.\n\nŞirin Hatun (?-?): mother of Şehzade Abdullah and Aynışah Sultan according to Uluçay. She is not present in Sicill-i Osmani among Bayezid II’s consorts. It is not known when she died but she was buried with her son and daughter in her son’s tomb. She had built a school in Bursa and a mosque in Trabzon.\n\nChildren:\n\nDamad Şehzade Abdullah (1465? - 6.11.1483): eldest son of Bayezid II, he was governor of Trabzon, Manisa and Konya, where he died. He is called Damad as well because he had married his cousin Ferahşâd Sultan, daughter of Mehmed II’s son Şehzade Mustafa. With her she had: a son (1481 - 1489), Aynışah Sultan (1482 - ??) and Şâhnisâ Sultan (1484 - ??). Both princesses reached adulthood as they both got married.\n\nAyşe Sultan (1465? - after 1515): according to Uluçay she may have been sister to Şehzade Ahmed or to Şehzade Korkut. She married Dâmâd Güveği Sinân Paşa around 1480 and had 6 children with him: Sultanzade Ahmed Bey, Sultanzade Mustafa Bey, Hanzade Ayşe Mihrihan Hanımsultan (who later married Dukagin-zâde Sultanzade Mehmed Paşa), Kamer-Şâh Hanımsultan (who later married Ahmed Bey son of Grand Vizier Mesîh Paşa), Fatma Hanımsultan (who later married Ahmed Bey son of Grand Vizier Mesîh Paşa) and Gevherşah Hanımsultan (who later married İbrahim Bey son of Ömer Bey). Ayşe Sultan built a mosque and a school in Gallipoli and in 1505 she established a foundation. She was buried in Istanbul.\n\nHatice Sultan (1465? - 1500): the identity of her mother is unknown. She firstly married Dâmâd Müderris Kara Mustafa Paşa around 1479 and had two children with him: Sultanzade Ahmed Çelebî (1480?-1500) and Hânzâde Hanımsultân. She secondly married Dâmâd Fâik Paşa sometime after 1483. Hatice Sultan built a mosque, school and fountain in Edirnekapi in Istanbul. She was buried in Bursa in the Hatice Sultan Tomb, built by her son.\n\nŞehzade Ahmed (1466? - 24.4.1513): Selim I’s biggest opponent during the fight for the throne, he was Bayezid II’s favourite son and the one he wanted to be succeeded by. His only known consort was called Bülbül like his mother. Ahmed had several children: Şehzade Murad (1495 - 1519), Şehzade Alaeddin (1496? - 1513), Şehzade Süleyman (1497? - 1513), Şehzade Osman (1498? - 1513), Şehzade Ali (1499? - 1513), Şehzade Mehmed (1500? - 1513), Şehzade Kasim (1501 - 1518), Kamer Sultan (later wife of Dâmâd Mehmed Çelebî), Fatma Sultan (later wife of Dâmâd Mehmed Bey), and an unnamed princess (later wife of Dâmâd Silahdar Süleyman Bey)\n\nŞehzade Korkut (1467 - 10.3.1513): another of Selim I’s opponents, he thought that he could quietly take the throne while Selim was busy with their brother Ahmed. He paid the janissaries for their support but when Selim arrived in Istanbul, they switched to his side. Governor of Amasya and then Manisa, he was allowed to return there after Bayezid II’s death but eventually Selim I had him executed. He had four children: two sons who died in infancy and Fatma Sultan (later wife of Dâmâd ‘Alî Bey) and Ferahşad Sultan (later wife of Dâmâd Malkoçoğlu ‘Alî Bey and Dâmâd Mehmed Balı Efendi)\n\nGevherimülûk Sultan (1467? - 1550): the identity of her mother is unknown. She married Dukaginzâde Dâmâd Ahmed Paşa and had two children with him: Nesl-i Şâh Hanımsultan (who married İskender Paşa) and Sultân-zâde Mehmed Paşa (who married his cousin Hanzade Ayşe Mihrihan Hanımsultan daughter of Ayşe Sultan). Gevherimülûk Sultan built a school near the Zal Mahmud Paşa Mosque, and she was buried there when she died.\n\nSelçuk or Selçukşah Sultan (1469 - 1508): the identity of her mother is unknown. She firstly married Dâmâd Ferhâd Bey around 1484 and had two children with him: Nesl-i Şâh Hanımsultan (1486?-1550?) and Sultânzâde Gaazî Husrev Bey/Paşa (1484?-18.6.1541).
