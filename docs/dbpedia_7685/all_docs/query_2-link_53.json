        "text": "Hello! The number and identities of Turhan Hatice’s children are up to debate, actually.\n\nMehmed IV (1.1.1642 - 17.12.1692): confirmed. 19th sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFatma Sultan (9.1642 - 1657): disputed, Peirce advances the theory that she could have been a daughter of Turhan Hatice’s because the valide sultan dedicated Qu’ran readings by thirty people to her soul. In 1645 she married Musahip (Silahdar) Yusuf Paşa, who was executed by Ibrahim himself on 22 January 1646. A month later, her father married her to Musahip Fazlı Paşa, whom he removed from Istanbul a couple of months later. She died in 1657 and was buried in the Yeni Valide Mosque.\n\nI tend to think that Gevherhan was not Turhan’s child as she was born in 1642 as well. Giving birth to three children in the same year is impossible. As for Beyhan, I didn’t find anything to confirm this. She was born in 1645 so Turhan could have been her mother but I couldn’t find evidence.\n\nAtike Sultan (?? - ??): she was referred to as Mehmed IV’s own sister so it seems that she was Turhan Hatice’s daughter. She married Sarı Kenan Paşa in 1648 and, when her husband was executed in 1659, she married Anatolian Inspector Mostarlı İsmail Paşa in the same year. She died at a young age in the reign of her brother.\n\nI couldn’t find anything about a Şehzade Ahmed, though I know it’s a popular theory. The future Ahmed II was born in February 1643 so it seems impossible to me that Turhan had another son between 1642 and 1643 - and who died before February 1643 - called Ahmed as well, considering that she also gave birth to Fatma in September 1642."
