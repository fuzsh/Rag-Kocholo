True Sir John Moore had defeated Soult before Coruña, but his death and the subsequent hurried embarkation of his Force gave reasonable grounds for the public to view the whole business as one of defeat and disaster. Naturally enough in view of the fact that the English had left the country, Soult claimed the fight as a victory for the French arms and as such it is regarded by our neighbours to this day. The best reply to this lies in the fact that had Soult won the battle, the British Force would have been practically annihilated. As it was, he failed at every point of attack and withdrew sadly stricken to the position he had occupied in the morning and the British were able to carry out their re-embarkation with little or no molestation.\n\nThe horror and astonishment of the nation at seeing the terrible condition of the British soldiers on their return from this most trying campaign have been already mentioned. I will now follow out the story of the Rifle Regiment upon its return to its old quarters in Hythe barracks and show how the losses in the ranks were made good.\n\nOrders were issued to complete both battalions to a strength of a thousand men each. The recruits were obtained almost entirely from the militia. Sir William Cope records how the regiment had already become so famous and so popular that not only were the deficiencies filled up in a very short time but more than a thousand volunteers presented themselves in excess of its requirements.\n\nThe following return shows the strength of the two battalions on 10 May 1809.\n\nWhen it is recalled that practically all the regiments employed in the Coruña campaign were in need of recruits and that a call was made for 18,000 men, this extraordinary rush to one of the most junior regiments in our Army is at first sight remarkable. For in brief the demand for some 350 recruits was quickly responded to by close upon 1,300. But the conditions were wholly abnormal. Men desirous of joining the Infantry of our Army had of course a wide choice before them and as a general rule were guided in their selection by the alleged merits and attractions of various regiments. Still whatever corps they joined, Guards or Line, they donned the red coat. But in the Rifle Corps an entirely new picture of soldiering was held before them. The mere fact that it was the only Regiment of Rifles composed of men of British nationality at the time in our Army was naturally an enormous inducement, for this alone centred attention on it and its doings. It would be affectation to pretend for a moment that the British recruit in 1809 had any desire or wish, even had he the power, to enlist in one of the corps of foreign riflemen then in our service which were never seen, had hitherto had but few opportunities of distinguishing themselves, and were for the most part condemned to perpetual foreign service of a specially objectionable nature in the West Indies.\n\nSo much for the mere fact of The Rifles being at the time a unique corps. Although less than ten years had passed since they had been first raised, as all who have read the first portion of this book will have perceived, they had been extraordinarily fortunate in being included in almost every expedition of note and had almost as invariably distinguished themselves. Whether it was under Nelson at Copenhagen or at the storming of Monte Video under Auchmuty, with Wellesley in Portugal or under Moore at Coruña, their deeds were in everyone’s mouth. Lastly the general nature of their duties appealed to many daring youths who possibly had visions of opportunities of distinguishing themselves by individual action which would not occur to the ordinary steadfast British Infantryman manoeuvring in close order. Nor were our Riflemen at all inclined to hide their light and leading from public gaze. Officers, Non-commissioned officers and Private Riflemen alike used every means to attract good recruits. It is on record how parties of the Rifle Corps, the same men who had stormed at Monte Video, who had driven the French with such dash and determination from the rugged heights of Roliça and who had fought only recently so stubbornly at Coruña, swept through the quiet English country villages rousing the sleepy inhabitants with the brazen notes of their bugles and shouting, \"Hurrah for the first in the field and the last out of it, the bloody fighting Ninety-fifth\"{1} and similar elegant appeals to the martial ardour of the yokels. Of the host of recruits who were attracted to the corps the novelty of the Green Jacket alone accounted for not a few. Surtees who belonged to the 56th Pompadours says that after he had once seen a British Rifleman, he was not content until he got transferred to the 95th. Rifleman Harris, who was in the 66th, describes how when he saw the 95th Rifles he fell in love with their smart, dashing, and devil-may-care appearance and volunteered forthwith.{2} Edward Costello makes a similar admission. In numerous journals allusions will be found to this factor as having attracted recruits, both officers and men, to the regiment. In letters of this period and in many contemporary books it is interesting to note how The Rifle Corps or The Rifles had become accepted popular titles. Seldom is the regiment referred to as the 95th or Rifle Regiment (its strictly correct designation) but rather as The Rifle Corps and frequently the famous Rifle Corps,{3} whilst Moore (brother of Sir John) in his history of the Coruña campaign, alludes to it as the brave Rifle Corps. With such ideas widespread amongst those who sought to serve in our Army it is therefore not surprising that in the course of a very few days the call for 338 volunteers from the militia brought in no less than 1,282 recruits. The Authorities thereupon were compelled to close further recruiting for the Rifles and most wisely decided to form an additional or third battalion. Major and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel McLeod of the 1st Battalion was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel to command it. Very shortly afterwards he exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Barnard whose name, as Sir W. Cope most truly says, is indelibly connected with the subsequent history of the regiment. Only two or three others of the promotions consequent on the formation of an additional battalion were given to the regiment, the services of those by whose valour and sufferings the regiment had obtained the fame which attracted these volunteers and to whose exertions in recruiting their great number was due, being with the usual injustice of the British Government to its Military defenders, ignored. General Sir David Dundas, then Commander-in-Chief of the Army, became Colonel-in-Chief on 31 August 1809 in place of Manningham and the Colonelcies of the three battalions were bestowed on Major-Generals Forbes Champagné, Sir Brent Spencer and the Hon. William Stewart. Thus was restored to the roll of the regiment the honoured name of its first Lieutenant-Colonel.{4}\n\nWe thus have the 95th Rifle Regiment for the first time at its maximum strength of three battalions. This it maintained throughout the Peninsular War and at Waterloo, but in 1818 on the general reduction after the withdrawal of the Army of Occupation from Paris the 3rd Battalion was disbanded. As will be seen the 3rd Battalion during the nine years of its existence took part in many of the most famous of the battles of the British Army and gloriously maintained the reputation of the Rifle Regiment.\n\nBut because the 95th Regiment was thus known as The Rifles, it would be incorrect to suppose that no other riflemen besides it and the 5th Battalion of the 60th existed in our Army at this period. True, it was the only Rifle Regiment, but as already pointed out in the first chapter of Part I of this book there were several corps of foreign riflemen existing in the British service before the first formation of the Rifle Corps. These almost without exception had been raised about the year 1794, for service in our West Indian possessions, which in those days loomed so largely in the estimation of the country and of our Military experts that at one time it was seriously considered whether we should not exchange Gibraltar for some of the Spanish West Indian Islands! The maintenance and defence of these islands was a matter of immense difficulty and perplexity to England as well as a great tax both in money and lives owing to the deadly nature of the climate. Fortescue describes how owing to this the guardianship of the islands had tended to fall more and more into the hands of black troops and of foreign mercenaries.\n\nBy the opening years of the Nineteenth Century most of these corps of foreign riflemen had been broken up owing to the perennial difficulty of obtaining recruits from the Continent to make good the terrible losses attendant on West Indian Service. One after another they had been drafted, or in Fortescue’s words they had been swallowed up by the 60th.{5} Thus, The York Rangers, a corps with riflemen clothed in green with red facings, had been drafted into the 2nd Battalion 60th. Waldstein’s Chasseurs, another corps similarly uniformed, had been drafted into the 4th Battalion 60th, whilst Löwenstein’s Chasseurs, a strong battalion clad in grey with green facings, and Hompesch’s Chasseurs wearing the same uniform as Waldstein’s Chasseurs and the York Rangers (now the well-known dress of the King’s Royal Rifles), had, as we have seen, gone to form the 5th Battalion 60th. Apparently advantage was taken of this infusion of riflemen into the 60th to establish rifle flank companies in the first four battalions between 1797 and 1799.{6} The 6th Battalion 60th, raised in 1799, had from its inception a rifle company, which according to Hamilton Smith’s drawings was dressed like the other defunct rifle corps.{7} Both Hompesch and Löwenstein after their respective corps had been drafted into the 60th proceeded to raise fresh rifle corps. In June 1798, Baron Ferdinand de Hompesch was gazetted to command A Regiment of Mounted Riflemen{8} whilst Löwenstein raised a battalion of riflemen in Germany a few months later.{9} Löwenstein’s Corps served under Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt in 1801 and was then about 500 strong.{10}\n\nWith regard to the usual dress of the riflemen in European armies at this period, the Jäger in the Prussian Army wore green jackets with red facings and grey or blue trowsers, such as were worn by the 5th Battalion 60th for the first few years of its existence, as well as by several of the other corps of foreigners, whereas the Tyrolese Jäger in the Austrian Service wore the grey uniform with green facings similar to Löwenstein’s.{11} But the all green uniform of the 95th Rifle Corps with black facings was equally well known on the Continent, and was especially common in the Russian Army, and in all probability Manningham and Stewart derived their inspiration for this style of clothing from what Stewart saw of them in the Austrian and Russian Armies when with the Archduke Charles and Suwarrow in 1798-99.\n\nAs the value of rifle fire to cover an attack became better appreciated, the custom of forming rifle companies was extended in our British regiments. In some instances the ordinary light company exchanged its muskets for rifles, in others a rifle company was formed in addition to the grenadier and light companies. Thus in the attack and capture of Martinique and Guadaloupe in 1810 by General George Beckwith, {12} rifle companies were much employed. How many of the British regiments had their flank companies armed with rifles it is difficult to ascertain, but Beckwith in his Despatches mentions the rifle company of the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers,{13} and later on those of the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the 60th.{14} The Royal York Rangers {15} and the Royal West India Rangers which were also with Beckwith each had two rifle companies. But there were many other Foreign corps in our pay at this period which had rifle companies. Thus both battalions of De Rolls’ Regiment (taken into our service in 1795 and disbanded in 1816) although dressed in scarlet had from their first formation rifle companies dressed in green.{16} The Bourbon regiment and the 1st Ceylon regiment likewise had rifle companies.{17}\n\nIn 1810, Auchmuty took Java and stormed the lines of Cornelis on 26 August 1811, a splendid exploit. Here only four British regiments were employed, the 1st Battalions 14th, 59th 69th and 78th Highlanders, and one and all had rifle companies, as well as light companies and grenadier companies of the usual type.{18}\n\nIt is not very hard to draw the inference from these and similar examples that during the first fifteen years of the Nineteenth Century, so far from the use of the rifle being confined to the 95th Rifle Corps and the 5th Battalion of the 60th, rifle companies were to be found almost everywhere where British troops were employed abroad, except in India.\n\nTurning now nearer home we find the Dutch regiment of Rifles raised in 1799 and disbanded in 1802. This Corps was armed with rifles of Dutch manufacture. The Chasseurs Britanniques formed in 1794 which served in Egypt in 1801 and went out to the Peninsula in 18 11, was not a rifle corps, but was clothed in red and armed with muskets and boasted of a grenadier and a light Company.{19}\n\nIn 1809 the Duke of Brunswick Oël’s Jäger regiment popularly known as the Black Brunswickers which had a proportion of riflemen, joined the British service. They were a motley lot and could not always be trusted at the outposts. All the same the Corps contained many good shots and daring men, and Wellington made use of it by breaking it up and posting the rifle companies to do light infantry work with various brigades. By such means did he control their propensity to desert to the enemy. This Corps as well as the others here mentioned were taken into the service of the Crown and figured in the Annual Army Lists among the Infantry of the Line.\n\nBut besides these light infantry and rifle corps in the British Service there were several light infantry regiments, some of them armed with rifles, in the two foreign contingents which fought throughout the Peninsular War alongside of our Riflemen.\n\nThe first of these foreign contingents was the famous King’s German Legion raised in 1804 consisting largely of Hanoverians which numbered amongst its regiments the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions. These were dressed as riflemen in green jackets with black facings; the 1st Light Infantry wore grey trowsers and a head-dress similar to that worn by the 5th Battalion 60th. The 2nd Light Infantry wore black trowsers and the same head-dress as the 95th Rifles and, save that it did not wear the narrow white piping to cuffs and collar, was almost identical with it.{20} Both of these Light Battalions had a considerable number of men armed with rifles.{21}\n\nMajor Beamish in his History of the King’s German Legion is careful to describe the Jäger Battalions of the Legion as the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions and in his book gives good coloured illustrations of the officers of the various corps from which it will be seen that the King’s German Light Infantry were dressed somewhat like the 95th Rifles and even more like the riflemen of the 5th Battalion of the 60th.{22}\n\nIn addition to these two light Corps every line battalion of the King’s German Legion had in each company ten men armed with rifles, known as sharpshooters\n\nThe second of these foreign contingents was the Portuguese Army under General Beresford which at first contained six battalions of Caçadores, increased in 1811 to twelve.\n\nThere has been some doubt as to whether the Caçadores were armed with light muskets (known as fusils) or with rifles. Major J. Seixeira Botelho of the Portuguese Artillery who has devoted much study to the subject and to whom I am indebted for much of the information here given inclines to the belief that some of the caçador regiments had light muskets and some had rifles. It is of interest to note that Wellesley in June 1809 applied for 40,000 knapsacks and 2,000 rifles for Beresford’s Portuguese Army{23} then in course of formation. The paper strength of Beresford’s Infantry force at this time was 40,810 of which 4,620 were Caçadores. These caçador battalions although of a paper strength of 770 R. and F. were actually only about 550 strong.{24} Assuming that the 2,000 rifles were destined for these six battalions, it would give about 330 rifles to 220 muskets in each of them. This proportion is strikingly like that which is found in the Light Infantry Battalions of the King’s German Legion at the same period viz. 392 rifles to 253 muskets. Again it is always possible that some of the Caçadores, at any rate in the first years of their existence, were armed with rifles of Portuguese manufacture. That such weapons were in use among the Portuguese levies is proved by a letter of Wellesley’s written at the time of his advance to the Douro in which he says: The Portuguese riflemen, the students I believe behaved remarkably well.{25}\n\nAgain later on he orders the formation of an ammunition depot at Almeida (the frontier fortress) in view of the future operations of the army to comprise amongst other things 1,200,000 rounds of musket ammunition and 200,000 rounds of rifle ammunition.{26} Since in 1809 the number of muskets and of rifles carried by the British force in Wellesley’s command was in the proportion of about 14 to 1 it is probable that this abnormal provision of rifle ammunition at an advanced depot must have been based on the requirements of the Portuguese Caçadores as well.\n\nSince two of the regiments of Portuguese Caçadores were embodied in the Light Division in 1810 and subsequently did such gallant service throughout the Peninsular campaigns, some description of them may be given here and more especially since little is known about them, their dress and their armament. To begin with their title of Caçadores (or Cazadores as it is sometimes spelt) is derived from the word cazar, to hunt, a cazador being a hunter or sportsman, the equivalent being the French chasseur and the German and Austrian Jäger. No little difficulty has been introduced by the popular belief, derived it is hard to say where, that every caçador, chasseur or Jäger was necessarily a rifleman Such however is now known to have not been the case in the times with which this history deals, still it requires much research to find out whether a particular corps styled \"chasseurs or Light Infantry\" were armed with smooth-bore muskets or rifles or a proportion of both.\n\nThe six caçador battalions were alike dressed in riflemen’s jackets of the peculiar brown shade known to artists as burnt umber and it is interesting to note that this shade of brown especially when much worn and exposed to sun and weather, is nothing more or less than the familiar khaki of today only of a somewhat darker hue.\n\nIn the Artillery Museum in Lisbon there are small models of soldiers dressed in the uniforms worn during the Peninsular War and among them is one of a private soldier of the 1st Caçadores in brown jacket and trowsers. The jacket is laced across the front with eight parallel stripes of black braid and there are three rows of silver buttons, very much as worn at one time by the Rifles. The regiments were all dressed alike save for the facings, the 1st caçador Regiment having blue cuffs and the 3rd, yellow cuffs and facings. Both had green light infantry wings on their shoulders. The shako was of the tall cylindrical pattern with a green tuft in front below which was the numeral of the corps in white metal and a plain bugle without tassels or bugle cords, of exactly the same pattern as is worn by the Rifle Brigade to this day in front of the astrachan rifle cap of the officers, but with the mouthpiece of the bugle to the right instead of on the left. The other caçador regiments were similarly dressed, the only difference being in the colour of their facings.\n\nTo these six, three regiments belonging to the Royal Lusitanian Legion were added, and in 1811 three more regiments were raised, bringing up to twelve the total number of regiments of Caçadores. According to Portuguese authorities all twelve were dressed in the same shade of brown. The three regiments of the Lusitanian Legion wore jackets of ivy green until they joined the Portuguese caçador regiments.\n\nIt may be asked how or by what means these numerous rifle corps were armed? As we have seen, upon the first raising of the Rifle Corps in 1800, a British weapon, the Baker rifle, was tried and selected. The various corps of foreign riflemen in our Army as well as the Rifle Companies of our British Volunteers both before this and for some years afterwards were armed with rifles of different patterns chiefly made on the Continent. It is not an easy matter to trace the source of firearms obtained by contract, but the following proves that prior to 1800 rifles were being obtained from abroad. On 20 May 1798, Mr. Crew had approved the pattern of a rifle barrel musket, of foreign fabric, and 2,000 stand of the same had been ordered to be procured for the volunteers.{27} Up to the year 1804 it had been the custom for the British Government to give out contracts to private firms of gunmakers to provide muskets or rifles. It was due to this that in 1800 a contract was given to Ezekiel Baker to arm the Rifle Corps. But in 1804 this was changed and an Assistant Inspector appointed at the Tower under whose supervision the Government commenced to manufacture its own small arms.{28} In the six years 1804-1809, about 13,000 rifles were thus made.{29} Of these over 2,000 went to arm the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Rifles raised in 1805 and 1809. The King’s German Legion and the Portuguese Caçadores{30} no doubt received their quota as did the rifle companies belonging to the various corps on active service abroad. It is also certain that a number were issued to British Militia Regiments and Corps of Volunteers{31} which had rifle companies at this period. In 1814 the Royal Denbigh Militia alone had 380 rifles and swords and no muskets or bayonets.{32} In the following year the Annual Inspection Returns show that the Royal West India Regiment had 254 rifles, 984 muskets and 10 fusees (sic) whilst the Royal York Rangers, also in the West Indies, had 202 rifles, 1,077 muskets and 36 fusils Other Corps had a smaller proportion of rifles, thus the 1st Ceylon Regiment had 60 and 1,018 muskets and the Bourbon Regiment 73 and 484 muskets.{33} In a Return of Arms in Store at the End of the War the Select Committee of Finance reported that at that time there were no less than 14,000 rifles in the Magazines of the Ordnance\n\nI have gone into this matter of the rifle corps in"
