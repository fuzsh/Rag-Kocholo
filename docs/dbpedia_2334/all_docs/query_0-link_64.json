        "text": "There has been rising trend of ethnic movements and conflicts across societies and countries in the contemporary world. The intensity and momentum of ethnic movements in South Asia, in particular, have inspired some to bring back the old logic of the primordial character of Asian civilization. But, many of the so-called developed societies of the Europe and America today are also faced with the phenomenon of ‘clash of ethnicities’. What then explains such a rise and how would one explain the process of formation of ethnic identities in the ‘modern’ world? There appears to be confusion and debate among social scientists about the nature and modalities of unfolding of ethnic identities. This paper, based on a review of relevant literature and supplemented by field experience, seeks to explain the conditions that seem to promote conflictual ethnic mobilization in the world today. It is the argument of this paper that ethnicity is not simply a product of socio-economic, cultural or ideological issues of the ‘insiders’ against the ‘outsiders’. While these ‘necessary’ conditions are certainly critical, they alone cannot explain the evocation and nourishment of ethnicity in many part of South Asia. One, therefore, needs to go beyond the conservative models to explain the phenomenon and look for ‘sufficient’ conditions. The role of such substantive factors of ethnic mobilization brings into focus the flexible and changing character of ethnic politics today. From this point of view, ethnicity appears to be a social construction. But again our identities cannot always be treated as free floating objects. There are limits both to plasticity of ethnicity as well as to its fixity and solidity. Ethnic attachments cannot be totally imaginary without any socio-cultural base. Hence, the process of boundary and identity formation can best be viewed from both structural and discursive points of view."
