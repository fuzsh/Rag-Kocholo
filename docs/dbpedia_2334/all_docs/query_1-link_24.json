If you want to keep walking you would have to go all the way to Quintana de Valdevielso, another 27kms, to find a place to sleep. Alternatively you could go off-piste to Oña (if you didn't come to Frias that way), 14 kms farther on. From Oña to Quintana de Valdevielso is about 24 kms. It is a trade off, though - the next day, if walked on the Viejo proper, takes you past some real jewels, which you would miss.\n\nthe taste of some of those jewels and my wikiloc. I mixed GR99 and GR85 to get the most of them on the most optimal route.\n\nLast edited: May 25, 2020\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\n#107\n\nand one of the most amazing little romanesque churches I have ever come across, san pedro de tejada.\n\nLast edited: May 25, 2020\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\n#108\n\nWell, as someone who is likely to be pushing against a time crunch, I wonder if there is any way to extend this day’s walk, either using the short route or the longer route.\n\nAnd Vira, when you mentioned the “Viejo proper”, does that mean that there are two essentially parallel routes, one the GR99 Ruta del Ebro and the other the Viejo?\n\nviejo camino in this thread is the camino that in this section follows the GR99.\n\nbut, for the sake of the argument, I would propose another (or perhaps the original?) viejo camino based on the route of the abbot gundisalvo I mentioned above. it runs more to the south of GR99 because of course this was not the most accessible valley in those times. I need to get my hands on gundisalvo's itinerary first, to be any more precise then a very general course.\n\nLast edited: May 26, 2020\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\n#109\n\nAlternative way: Yew Trees\n\nNearby but not on the camino there is a protected stand of ancient yews – 64 numbered and well-studied trees that are about 1000 years old. Here is an account of a loop track that takes in part of the camino as well as the trees:\n\nhttp://tierrasdeburgos.blogspot.com/2011/09/ruta-de-senderismo-los-tejos-de.html\n\nThe track passes through Hoz de Valdivielso, so if you are super interested in seeing them, it would be easy to walk to the Valdivielso that way instead of using @caminka ’s track.\n\noh, oh!

I would be tempted to go from Frias to Trespaderne via Tobera/Oña (the first map in my last post), and then to QdV the next day, following your track - thus getting the best of both worlds.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\n#111\n\noh, oh!

Going that way means missing the rock hermitage and the waterfall, but these are really serious trees, rare and special ones, and there are a number of them..\n\nLast edited: May 25, 2020\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\n#112\n\nI can’t contribute much to the choice of route, but I can hunt around for opening times!\n\nThe official web site of León y Castilla Turismo says it’s private property. Not sure how in the world that could have happened! It does, however, list phone numbers 947 303 200 or 652 641 079 to arrange a visit. Suggests that we might be able to get in with a call a few days ahead.\n\nMost websites show few if any photos of the interior, but it does look very pretty. One blog said the guide prohibits pics inside, so that might explain it! Arteguías comments on svelte, high arches and shows a picture. If you haven’t seen this website, it is pretty comprehensive. Links to about 35 monasteries in the province of Burgos alone, and a page for every province in Spain.

I would be tempted to go from Frias to Trespaderne via Tobera/Oña (the first map in my last post), and then to QdV the next day, following your track - thus getting the best of both worlds.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nin 2012 the church was open in the morning and in the afternoon. the lady that attended to the key was later at the albergue arte y natura in quintana de valdivielso. she was very nice. I arrived at the church with about 15min to spare (till 12h, probably) but she let me run around ohing and ahing and taking photos till I was satisfied. there was a small admission fee, I think.\n\nyour impression is correct, @VNwalking. these two days would be very splendid indeed. in fact, with all the awesome detours/alternatives popping up here, I might be considering walking it again!

From the website about Las Merindadades:\n\n“Until [recently], the road that led from the Merindades to the capital of Burgos passed through El Almiñé. In this town the ascent of La Cuesta began, an impressive mountain pass that culminated, some 1,000 meters above sea level, in the hermitage of Nuestra Señora de la Hoz. The construction of the current [road through] the Puerto de la Mazorra diverted traffic and hermitage and town lost significance. El Almiñé is the paradigm of what some authors consider to be a village-road since, in fact, its urban structure follows, broadly speaking, the linearity of the Burgos road. [...] Travelers, some of them pilgrims, left the Burgos Mountains most likely for this magnificent place. Today, in El Almiñé there is no more bustle. The abandonment of the road plunged the town into oblivion.”\n\nThe old calzada is our route onwards, and it's spectacularly well preserved.\n\nWere you coming from the North (of you’d detoured to Poza de la Sal as @Sheffield James did, you could descend into QdV on this road. The rest of us walk up it early in the day, much easier than going down on that surface!\n\nThe old road climbs steeply and then levels off at Santa Isabel o de la Hoz,\n\nHere, the camino turns right crossing the Alto de la Mazorra towards Pesqueria del Ebro.\n\nFrom the mirador on the CL-629, the view down to the Valdevielso looking back the way we came from yesterday is not too shabby at all:\n\nThe Dolmen de la Cotorrita is a little to the North of the camino before the village of Porquera del Butrón, well worth the short detour. This dolmen is roughly 5,500 years old and was excavated and restored in 1969. It has an east-west orientation, and at least 15 people were buried there.\n\nDolmen de la Cotorrita\n\nLa “cotorrita” es uno de los “cinco grandes” dólmenes de la comarca de Las Loras. En realidad, hay muchos más, pero estos son los que han s...\n\nThis wesite mentions the church at Porquera de Butron as having been 'restored;' it is certainly not of the caliber of others we have seen down in the valleys. Up here on the mesa, life is harsher than in the valley, and the village church in Cubillo de Butron has obviously fallen on hard times.\n\nFrom here the camino zig-zags back down to the Ebro.\n\nRight at the old bridge over the river in Pesquera de Ebro is the Ermita de San Antonio; here we cross the bridge and enter the village.\n\nThe first document that talks about Pesquera de Ebro is dated to 941. As the town's name implies, it emerged as a fishing place and developed on the edge of the strategic bridge over the Ebro.\n\nThe town, with emblazoned houses and old palaces, is considered a Historic Site. It's is one of the towns with the highest density of noble shields in all of Spain. Most are from the 17th and 18th centuries, a time when a large part of their inhabitants were nobility. But now it is a humble place with only a handful of residents.\n\nThere are at least two CRs to stay, one right by the river.\n\nSo here are some natural wonders to incorporate into your (hopefully our) little meander.\n\n'Our' sounds very good to me, Laurie! may it be so!\n\nAnd wow, thank you.

Pesqueria del Ebro – Orbaneja del Castillo 25.8km\n\nToday is about the Cañon de Ebro!\n\nThere are two possibilities today:\n\n@caminka’s track:\n\nhttps://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trai...quera-del-ebro-orbaneja-del-castillo-21433123\n\nOr a shorter flatter version that goes straight up the river, rather than going up and down and doubling back:\n\nhttps://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/pesquera-de-ebro-orbaneja-23406726\n\nEither offers an amazing day in the Ebro gorge.\n\nIf you choose to follow @caminka’s track, the day zig-zags up the Ebro going from one side of the river to the other 3 times. The first third of the day involves a gradual climb of 405m, followed by a sharp descent of 356m. Other than that the camino follows a barely uphill grade, flat but just uphill enough to be following a running river.\n\nThe main attraction today is the gorge itself.\n\nFollowing @caminka’s track, we get a good view of it from Cortiduera the first village we encounter after climbing up the hill above the river. This is a town that was once much more vital and populated than it is now, judging by the crests over hoses doors, and the church is slowly crumbling.\n\nBecause of the view, it would be a lovely place to spend the night.\n\nnow there is also accommodation in cortiguera, casa rural talamo. cortiguera was during my next day stage because in 2012 it was a village of ruined houses and one or two weekend houses. but it would be nice to stay there because the nearby evening views of the canon del ebro must be amazing.\n\nFrom here the track zig-zags down to Valdelateja. Once there, if you are keen for a break, there may be a spa about 500m off the camino across the river at Balneario de Valdelateja. I say ‘may’ because it was reported closed in 2009, but there looks to be an active website in 2020.\n\nhttps://hotel-balneario-de-valdelateja.vivehotels.com/en/\n\nAt this point, the camino goes first down the Ebro on the right bank, crossing and then going back up the river on the left bank, passing the Ermita de Ebro, crossing back to the right bank near Quintanilla-Escalada with its Iglesia San Miguel.\n\nAround one more sharp Oxbow and we arrive at beautiful Orbaneja del Castillo. It’s been a day of stunning beauty, ending with a bang at this ‘Most Beautiful Village in Burgos.”\n\nOrbaneja del Castillo\n\nOrbaneja del Castillo is certainly astonishing. The waterfalls and the way the village is oriented with views down the river reminds me of villages in far off Ladakh, in a part of India that was once called “Western Tibet.” The village is nestled on the north side of the oxbow, an amazing sight: a village that climbs up the hillside, with its terracotta roofs, cobbled streets and wooden balconies. A magnificent waterfall splits the village into two halves, and ragged cliffs tower above it all. There are caves above the waterfall, and across the river are the ruins of the castle that gave the town its name. Hundreds of vultures nest in the cliffs.\n\nMay 31, 2020\n\n#133\n\nAnother jaw-dropper, wow, VN.\n\nTo keep me geographically anchored, can you tell me about where this stage is in relationship to the camino de las Asturias stages?

We have the right name!\n\nAnd from a general brochure about UNESCO-recognized Geoparks in Spain:\n\nLas Loras Geopark, in Burgos and Palencia (Castilla y León)\n\nA rugged terrain with imposing ravines and rocky outcrops, where you can find more Romanesque churches, convents and monasteries per kilometre than anywhere in Europe. These are the distinguishing features of Las Loras Geopark, which offers plenty of routes to explore on foot, by car or mountain biking. Some of the most spectacular landscapes are the gorges of the rivers Ebro and Rudrón (in Burgos) and Las Tuerces (in Palencia), close to the interesting Cave of Los Franceses and the recommended Mirador de Valcabado viewing point. Throughout most of the park you’ll also find pre-Roman castros, Neolithic dolmens, and Iron Age sites like the castros of Monte Bernorio, Peña Amaya, Peña Ulaña and Monte Cildá. Many of the park’s waterfalls are easy to access, such as those of Orbaneja del Castillo (Burgos) and Covalagua (Palencia). The area is ideal for adventure sports like rock climbing or canyoning.\n\nHere is a stunning photo from one of those sites, of Peña Amaya with a gorgeous church in the foreground:\n\nAmaya was the old capital of the Cantabrian people until its fall at the hands of the Visigoths, and in Medieval times it was an important stop on the way to Santiago. It is well south of here, but along the alternative (historical) route to Aguilar that @caminka was talking about:\n\nit would be exciting if this could be extended to aguilar along the abbot gundisalvo's route (Salvatierra, Alegría, Armentía, Trespuentes, Puentelarra, Tobalina, Frías, Oña, Sedano, Amaya, Nogales, Mave, Aguilar) which is different then GR 99 ruta del ebro, but then there would be two options!\n\nOsmAnd makes that simple to plot, at least in terms of the basic route, which could be easily tweaked.\n\nHere you go:\n\nLast edited: Jun 3, 2020\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 5, 2020\n\n#139\n\nDay 14.

The Olvidado crosses through this area, but we didn’t see this! The Camino does take you past several large clusters of paleolithic graves, which were interesting but this is spectacular.\n\nTurns out that this XII century ermita de San Bernabé is about 2.5 km off the camino Olvidado, if I had only known!!!!!\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Ojo_Guareña,_julio_de_2008_(2).jpg\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 8, 2020\n\n#142\n\nthis is spectacular\n\nYes - the inside looks especially so.\n\nBut clearly San Miguel de Presillas is pretty impressive too.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 9, 2020\n\n#143\n\nDay 15. Polientes – Villanueva de la Nia 13.4 or 17.5 (Road or Caminka’s track)\n\nThe way @caminka went is a bit longer than going directly along the road, and you could go that way if you wanted to shorten this leg. but you'd be missing this:\n\nGraves and hermitage of La Velilla -Rocamundo\n\nNear Rebollar de Ebro, quite close to the outset where the camino crosses the river at Polientes, is the hermitage of La Velilla. It’s a very short detour off the camino and a place of local pilgrimage. The building is from the 17th C, with a vaulted apse and a belfry. Adjacent to the hermitage, there are three rock tombs, now open to the weather.\n\nIglisia San Vicente\n\nJust past the town of Rebollar de Ebro and also a short detour off the camino, San Vicente was built in the 13th century and has been rebuilt several times during the 16th and 19th centuries.\n\nSan Pantaleon\n\nA little off the camino between Sobrepeña and Sobrepenilla is San Pantaleón, an archaeological site that has yielded the remains of 4,500 years of human habitation from prehistory to the end of the Middle Ages. Among its numerous ruins are its church and an impressive necropolis from the 13th century. The town of La Puente del Valle on the Ebro near here has an interpretation center. It’s a short detour form the camino – take the next road to the right after leaving Sobrepeña and there will an access on your left after about 1km. Altogether it’s a 2.24km round trip there and back to the camino.\n\nhttps://enricvillanueva.wordpress.c...-san-pantaleon-la-puente-del-valle-cantabria/\n\nErmita Santa Maria de Entrepuerta\n\nThis is right near the camino shortly after the turnoff to San Vicente, built on a rocky outcrop that forms a small cliff, at the base of which is an artificial cave, presumably used by hermits at one point.\n\nAt the foot of the belfry and to the south of the hermitage there are more graves, oriented East-West.\n\n[The photo above is from:\n\nhttps://enricvillanueva.wordpress.com/\n\nIt’s a very useful website with a list of rock tombs all over Spain, with pages about each one.]\n\nIf the days leading through the gorge were about cave hermitages, this part of the camino seems to be about necropoli. There are many, and they stir up many questions...about the burials, about who and when and what happened to the mortal remains of so many...\n\nIglesia de la Purisma, Sobrepenilla\n\nThis church is a little gem, with some quirky sculptures that are more rough than artistic.\n\nA website devoted to the Romanesque describes it this way (Google and my rough translation):\n\nThe building defines the archetype of a mountain village church. The workshops that built this type of edifice had few financial means. The [local] stonemasons proved to be skilled in roughing the stone blocks, lifting sturdy stonework, although they left much to be desired in terms of sculpting figurative scenes, demonstrating more imagination than mastery.\n\nVillanueva de la Nia.\n\nPosada del Cazador with its welcoming red parasols is a happy sight in Villanueva de la Nia.\n\nThere is one more church at the end of the day here at Villnueva de la Nia - the Church of San Juan Bautista, which sits on a sandstone promontory on the far side of town. Its was built in the 12th century, but now only the head with a transept and the semicircular apse are preserved – the rest of the building is a conglomerate of extensions and renovations from the 16th to the 19th Cs. But the iconography in the outer corbels and in the capitals of the triumphal arch are still there, carved the same sometimes erotic style as in San Pedro de Cervatos.\n\nHere are @caminka’s photos from her wililoc track: the guy picking his teeth made me chuckle out loud. And then someone has a toothache...and is that woman giving birth!? From this fortunate vantage point it makes me ponder the common and universal woes in the 12th C., when toothaches and birth would have been much more dangerous events than they are now.\n\nThere’s a necropolis here, too, but not well preserved. One site I was looking at said that “it is certain that throughout the perimeter that surrounds the apse there is an extensive necropolis that could possibly be dated between the 10th and 11th centuries.”\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nJun 9, 2020\n\n#144\n\nDay 15.

My OsmAnd map says that it’s possible to make a detour up there – it adds 3km to the day and is well worth it if you are fit and have the time. What you miss out on, though, are the next two churches – which are special. (On the map below, the camino is the fine purple line while the detour is the wide one.)\n\nThere’s no doubt that this whole area is Ground Zero for an explosion of humble Romanesque hermitages and village churches. Here is a nice blog that describes a lot of what we encounter between here and Aguilar de Campoo, with some nice photos:\n\nhttp://entrebosquesypiedras.blogspot.com/search/label/Unos días por el valle de Valderredible\n\nAnd here is a lovely comprehensive site that offers a ton of information about the Romanesque in Cantabria:\n\nhttps://www.cantabriaromanica.com/articulos/.c/iglesias\n\nStaying down on the valley floor, shortly after Susila we come to Castrillo de Valdelomar, with its church from the 13th C.\n\nThere’s an extensive necropolis there as well.\n\nIglesia rupestre de Santa Maria de Valverde\n\nFrom Lonely Planet (of all places!):\n\nDating back to the 10th century or earlier, Santa María de Valverde is the Ebro Valley's largest iglesia rupestre (rock-cut church). Written accounts from 978 AD describe the church as a simple one-nave affair; a 12th-century Romanesque expansion added the rooftop bell-gable and widened the interior into its present three-nave form.\n\nThe church retains a magical, rustic beauty, with irregular stone arches and rough-cut stone floors suffused in ghostly subterranean light. Visits are in conjunction with visits to interpretation centre next door, which gives an excellent introduction to this and the other rock-cut churches of the Ebro Valley.\n\nHours:10am-2pm & 4-7pm Sat & Sun mid-Mar–Jun & Sep–mid-Dec, Tue-Sun Jul-Aug, Mass 1pm Sun year-round.\n\nHere is a map; the CA 273 is the camino here:\n\nPomar de Valdivia (Iglesia Parroquial La Santa Cruz)\n\nRight after the Iglesia Santa Maria de Valverde, the camino leaves the road and takes off to the left. But if you carry on straight ahead you come to Peña Hortada (on the left as you walk towards the town of San Martin de Valdelomar), and Iglesia de San Augustin in the village.\n\nEremitorio rupestre de Peña Horacada\n\nAnother simple cave hermitage, reminiscent of the first one we encountered after Trespaderne. The website at the bottom of the photo is a wonderful source of information.\n\nIglesia de San Augustin\n\nAnother old and humble village church\n\nMonte Bernorio\n\nApproaching AdC, the camino swings South around Monte Bernorio. It may not be worth a detour as there is not much to see, but it’s worth knowing what you are walking past. It’s a nondescript hill, and one that looks like nothing much after the high landscape drama of the last days. But it it's the site of one of the most important cities of the Iron Age Pre-Roman people in Cantabria, which was continuously inhabited from the 8th C BC to the time of the Roman conquest. On it are what remains of its walls, fortifications, a fort and the necropolis. Some people consider Monte Bernorio to be one of the most important archeological sites in Europe.\n\nHere is its story:\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/public...the_Oppidum_of_the_Cantabri_at_Monte_Bernorio\n\nSouth of Monte Bernorio, the two villages the camino passes through – Rebolledo de la Inera and Renedo de la Inera – each have a small 12th C church.\n\nSoon the camino crosses the autovia and enters the outskirts of Aguilar de Campoo.\n\nThus ends this quieter but spectacular journey, as we merge with and continue on the 'regular' Olvidado that comes up from Bilbao. For the combination of history, patrimony, landscape, and sheer beauty this route rivals some of the best caminos out there, and I am surprised it is such a 'sleeper.'\n\nJun 12, 2020\n\n#146\n\nIt’s a good thing this thread is ending, since it takes my ipad a few minutes to load it all up. What an amazing document you have created during this lockdown, VN. Many many hopes that it will someday become a real walk.\n\nI made it a sticky, so it will not slide down into Olvidado oblivion.

I think the split may be Puebla de Arganzon. It crosses the Olvidado at Cervera de Pisuerga, which is one day northwest of Aguilar de Campoo, so it must run a little north of the Ebro route you’ve so brilliantly laid out here.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 12, 2020\n\n#149\n\nI think the split may be Puebla de Arganzon.

Many gold stars and many hugs of thanks to @VN!!!!!!!!!\n\nBuen camino, Laurie\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 15, 2020\n\n#151\n\nTo cap off the thread here are a few tidbits I found about Aguilar de Campoo:\n\nIn a locked cave above AdC are the remains of two tombstones, which are said to mark the graves of Bernardo del Carpio (son Infanta Doña Ximena, daughter of King Don Alonso el II who died in the 850s), and of Fernán Gallo \"a native of Burgos, Chancellor Maior in the battle of Ronces Valles where he lost an eye but not the banner.\" There is a piece of faux-history abut the tomb that has camino connections: Durendal (the sword of Roldán who died near Roncesvalles) was said to be in the tomb of Bernardo del Carpio who – according to legend – took the sword after the battle of Roncesvalles. So it ended up with him here after he died, In 1522, Carlos I took the sword to Madrid, where it remains. Some sword or another, that is...Durendal or not, this story would have been a nice lure for pilgrims and donors.\n\nIn town, below the castle is Ermita de Santa Cecilia, with its famous capital with the slaughter of the innocents.\n\nAdC has a bunch of churches in addition to that:\n\nMonastery of Santa María la Real (11th-13th centuries)\n\nCollegiate Church of San Miguel (11th-16th centuries)\n\nChurch of Olleros de Pisuerga (7th-9th centuries)\n\nChurch of San Andrés (12th century)\n\nMonastery of Santa Clara (founded in 1430)\n\nOf these, the Monastery of Santa Maria la Real is farthest out of town to the West. According to an ancient legend, the origins of this monastery date back to the early 9th century, when the inhabitants of the northern mountain ranges gradually began to migrate towards the plains of the central plateau. However, the earliest records of and the first donations to the monastery date to the start of the 11th century; eventually its influence would extend into the lands of Palencia, Valladolid, Burgos and Cantabria.\n\nThe Collegiate of San Miguel is in the middle of the old town.\n\nThe church has three spacious pointed naves and dates back to the visigothic times, but was rebuilt in the 11th century. The main front is Romanesque and the original Gothic altarpiece was replaced by a Renaissance one and the tower is Herreran. The church contains sepulchres dating from the 12th-16th centuries and the white marble mausoleums of the marquises of Aguilar, who are represented praying and with clothes reaching down to their ankles.\n\nOlleros de Pisuerga - the Church of the Santos Justo and Pastor\n\nThis is another cave church, well out of town to the South on the outskirts of Olleros de Pisuerga. From the outside you can only see by a small Atrium built in modern times, but inside is a Romanesque church, with two naves topped by barrel vault and its respective apses with the typical quarter sphere; the oldest part of the church is the the Sacristy and funeral chapel.\n\nThere's a very nicely done website that is a source of a lot of detailed information about Romanesque churches in the area here, including a name and phone number to call for keys! (The photo above came from this website):\n\nRomanesque Churches of Northern Spain - Part 1\n\nIntroduction Northern Spain has an extraordinary number of beautiful Romanesque churches. Whether you are following the pilgrimage ...\n\nThis is pretty sketchy information about AdC, so if anyone who's walked the Olvidado has anything more to add, please sing out!\n\nIn my walking, I'm well along on my way to Ponferrada at this point - but will not continue the thread past Aguilar de Campoo. There's already plenty information out there from here on out!\n\nLast edited: Jun 15, 2020\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 15, 2020\n\n#152\n\nI think it is the most exhaustive and excellent effort I have seen when it comes to mapping out possibilities on an untravelled camino.

This route truly has it all.\n\nJun 15, 2020\n\n#153\n\nOn our Olvidado zoom, I was just reminiscing about visiting the Ermita underneath the castle in Aguilar. The first time through, I walked up to the doors and found them locked, not surprising. On my second walk, after @alansykes waxed poetic about being lucky to get inside, I did a little research. And last year, I struck gold. I went to the priest’s house, which is right in the main square near the Colegiata. I gave him my passport and he gave me, gasp, the keys to the church. And the keys to the light box inside the church. It could only have been more atmospheric if the keys had been those hunge medieval clunkers, but they were modern keys.

This news article dated February 2020 describes a new pedestrian bridge constructed 200 meters upriver from the old location. I don’t know why this news article only shows a picture of the old bridge with its middle missing. It would be comforting to actually see a picture of the new bridge!

As VN said later on in the thread, it would be easy to follow the “official“ Viejo (stage from Baños de Sobrón to Trespaderne) till Montejo de Cebas. At that town, don’t cross the river and walk about 3 km on BU-520 into Frías. The next day, no need to backtrack to Montejo de Cebas. There’s another bridge right out of Frías that will connect with the camino track.\n\nAs far as lodging, Convento Vadillo in Frías will rent individual rooms and communicates via WhatsApp. 34 667 05 68 69.\n\nWith a 19 km walk from Baños (or more likely the Hotel Durtzi a few kms beyond) it will make for a very short day with plenty of time to enjoy Frías and walk 2-3 km to Tobera, where there is a romanesque church Santa María de la Hoz. Below it is a small ermita, santo Cristo de los Remedios. Pictures show it to be in a beautiful setting, but the church is likely to be closed. There is also a path up through the village and beyond to some waterfalls.\n\nDo not confuse this with Santa María de Tobera, another Romanesque church (according to what I have read it has the most explicitly erotic capitals in the province), which is located near the village of Santurde, about 16 km from Miranda de Ebro.\n\nNext day, 10 km to Traspaderne, and carry on!\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nDec 14, 2020\n\n#160\n\nAs far as lodging, Convento Vadillo in Frías will rent individual rooms and communicates via WhatsApp. 34 667 05 68 69.\n\nBTW, This is a CR, not a convent.\n\nThey had me there.

Based on all this great information, I have tentatively sketched out a day from Frías to Oña to Trespaderne. I have found two very different routes to go from Frías to Oña.\n\nOne goes south. One goes north. The southerly one is about 5 km longer and has a few hundred more meters of elevation. That’s probably going to be the deciding factor, but I just thought I’d check with my Viejo comrades.\n\nOña to Trespaderne is about 18, with several miradores on the way, so I am envisioning a lot of natural beauty.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nDec 13, 2021\n\n#167\n\nQuestion for the day. Based on all this great information, I have tentatively sketched out a day from Frías to Oña to Trespaderne. I have found two very different routes to go from Frías to Oña.\n\nSorry, Laurie, I missed this. Replying only a year or so late...\n\nLooking at your wikiloc tracks they are similar if not identical to what I posted here.\n\nSo to save you the hassle of going back, here are a few things from upthread that are pertinent, all in one place:\n\nSo here are options, all in one place; the main difference between A/B/C/D and E/F being whether you get to Oña from Frias or Pancorbo. The options I think are preferable have the asterisks; it would be a pity to miss the stage between Trespaderne and QdV. Really the main choice comes down to whether you will see Frias or Pancorbo; A and E below allow the highlights between Trespaderne and QdV regardless of which way you walk.\n\nVia Frias\n\n*A. Frias - Oña (via Tobera) - Trespaderne (29.7km),\n\nTrespaderne - Quintana de Valdivielso (26.8 km) on Camino\n\nB. Frias - Oña (via Tobera) (18.1 km),\n\nOña - Quintana de Valdivielso (28.2km)\n\n(Through the Valdivielso valley, but bypassing Trespaderne, Ermita Rupestre de San Pedro, and the hermitage/waterfall at Tartales de los Montes)\n\nC. Frias - Oña (via Tobera) (18.1 km), Oña - Poza de Sal (31.5 km),\n\nPoza de Sal - Quintana de Valdivielso (29.8 km)(What @Sheffield James did)\n\nD. Frias - Oña (via Trespaderne)(24.3 km),\n\nOña - Quintana de Valdivielso (28.2 km)(as B, above, but walking to Oña via Trespaderne, not Tobera)\n\nVia Pancorbo\n\n**E. Pancorbo - Oña, (32.7 km)\n\nOña - Trespaderne (12.3km)(onward on regular Viejo)\n\nF. Pancorbo - Oña, (32.7 km)\n\nOña - Quintana de Valdivielso (28.2 km, as B and D above)\n\nI bolded my preferences. I would love to try E, though it misses Frias and Tobera.\n\nHere are the screenshots of my OSMand maps:\n\nHere are some maps...mix and match to your heart's content!\n\nThe main thing I would not want to miss with whatever alternative are the Romanesque goodies in the Valdivielso Valley and surrounding areas. So:\n\nHere's a screenshot of what it would look like to go from Oña to QdV; it's about 25 km. It involves some backtracking from the day before, but this way at least you do not miss San Pedro de Tejada.\n\nSpecifically, there is a section of the Romanesque in the Valdivielso Valley and surrounding areas.\n\nAnd the last comment about the Pancorbo option here:\n\nI know you discounted it, but Puebla de Arlanzon-Pancorbo-Oña-Frias is a great option, blowing through Miranda de Ebro. It's only 32 km between PdA and Pancorbo, giving the same number of days as PdA-MdE-S-F.\n\nThis is the one place on the Viejo where there are lots of alternative routes, and all of them have their benefits and drawbacks.

I think you met the guide there also.\n\nThere are four so-called “iglesias pintadas de la llanada” (which include Gaceo, Alaiza, Añua, Arbulo). These churches are all located in the vicinity of Salvatierra-Agurain. The Álava Medieval site has more info.\n\nI’ve just gotten some updated information on the scheduled visits, and it will be a challenge for pilgrims.\n\nThe visits are done on weekends, holidays, and Tuesdays and Thursdays in summer. They have two blocks, a morning and an afternoon segment. You can sign up for one or both.\n\n11:00-12:30 - Gaceo and Alaiza (which, in my untrained opinion, seem to be more interesting than the other two).\n\nThen the 1 - 2:30 pm block alternates between visiting Añua and Arbulo (Saturday and Tuesday in summer) or a visit to Salvatierra (Sunday and Thursdays in summer).\n\nProblem is, you need your own car. One solution, for those who have the time, would be to walk from Salvatierra to the church at Gaceo (close to Salvatierra) for the 11 am visit. Then from Gaceo to Alaiza, there would be two possibilities — hope that another tourist would take you to Alaiza and then back to Salvatierra) or take a cab both ways (cabs in Salvatierra) or use one of those options to get to Alaiza and then walk back to Salvatierra (about 7 km). This would probably require a rest day, but since the great albergue in Alegría is only 12 (flat) kms from Salvatierra, maybe you could add those kms on after the visit(s) to make some forward progress that day.\n\nThis part of Spain is so full of ancient churches that I know it’s impossible to visit all of them on the Viejo, but some might find this alternative interesting.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nJun 18, 2024\n\n#191\n\ngreat albergue in Alegría is only 12 (flat) kms from Salvatierra, maybe you could add those kms on after the visit(s) to make some forward progress that day.\n\nThat sounds like a really good idea.\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nJun 20, 2024\n\n#192\n\nThere are four so-called “iglesias pintadas de la llanada” (which include Gaceo, Alaiza, Añua, Arbulo).

I planned to have a rest day in Vitoria-Gastiez but will take it in Salvatierra-Agurain instead. I will have to take a taxi but will check if there is any other pilgrims in the area nearer the time who might share.\n\nPilgrim 122\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\ncurrently walking Rome to Santiago\n\nJun 20, 2024\n\n#194\n\nI really love Romanesque churches especially those with frescoes.
