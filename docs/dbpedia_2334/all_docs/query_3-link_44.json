Jen-Yi (Jay) Chen, Atikur Rahman, Drew Adams from Case Western Reserve University screened 3,200 small molecules and discovered that C646, a compound known to inhibit a protein called p300, also targets another protein, Exportin-1 (XPO1), for degradation. This degradation requires a process called neddylation. The study found that C646‚Äôs effects were reversed in cells with a mutation in XPO1, confirming its role as a key target. Since XPO1 helps transport proteins out of the nucleus and also binds to DNA, degrading it with C646 reduces its presence along with p300 on DNA, mimicking p300 inhibition. This research shows that targeting XPO1 could be a useful strategy for altering gene regulation.

While previous research has explored various crystallization techniques, the novel study by the Farah Laboratory for Advanced Functional/Medicinal Polymers & Smart Drug Delivery Technologies Wolfson Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute (RBNI), Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, featured on the cover of Small Science breaks new ground by selectively developing hollow-like or condensed progesterone microcrystals with high yield and controlled properties! In this work Asst Prof Shady Farah and his team engineered the hormone from a molecular structure into new chemical crystals with a double prismatic structure. They prodused hollow crystals and condensed crystals and both shapes produced stable polymorphs with tunable, slow-release profiles, maintaining release for 14 days, making them ideal for long-term, localized applications.

Just as we use bricks to construct buildings, researches from The RNA Institute, University at Albany use nanometer-sized motifs and tiles made of DNA to create elaborate structures in DNA nanotechnology. In this work, published in Nature Communications, Madhanagopal Barathraj, Arun Richard Chandrasekaran and colleagues studied an unusual motif called switchback DNA. It has only two strands and so, it can be directly compared with a regular double helical structure of DNA that everyone is familiar with. In switchback DNA, the two strands have sections, called half-turns, that resemble the normal DNA, but the way they are arranged makes switchback DNA unique! Typically, DNA is a double helix with right-handed helical sense throughout the molecule. In switchback DNA, right-handed half-turns are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole is a left-handed double helix. This is because if you trace the backbone of DNA along the helix, you will find that after every half-turn, the strand folds back. Researchers found that these unique structural features make switchback DNA less stable and more vulnerabile to enzymes. The results of this study will help researchers who make DNA nanostructures for various applications to improve their designs using switchback DNA motif!

The article featured on the Royal Society of Chemistry Green Chemistry cover is devoted to biomass-derived chemicals and their use for the production of consumables such as plastic bottles. Robert Wojcieszak, Ivaldo Itabaiana Jr and colleagues investigated the enzymatic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), one of the most important high added value chemical derived from biomass. They used a modular flow chemistry platform to optimize HMF oxidation and maximize FDCA production via enzymatic and photocatalytic cascade process. The implementation of this innovative approach has led to the effective synthesis of FDCA, demonstrating an impressive 40-fold increase in productivity compared to the traditional batch system.

Furan-based diols having no to low estrogenic activity are used to make diglycidyl ethers (DGEs) and then cured using a model diamine to form thermoset coatings. The coatings' properties are comparable to that from a bisphenol-A based epoxy resin, showing that these DGEs can be used as a replacements.

Electron-driven chiral dynamicsüåÄ‚öõÔ∏è Vincent Wanie, Bernard Pons, Francesca Calegari and colleagues published a paper on how chirality can be changed using UV light. They studied how the motion of electrons in chiral molecules can affect reactivity of these molecules. For this purpose they devised a new UV laser technology that produce ultrashort 2fs pump pulses! ‚ÄúAn electric current that surrounds a chiral molecule with a clockwise directionality (blue) can, when pumped with an ultrafast UV pulse, reverse to a counterclockwise orientation (yellow) in less than 10 fs, the time scale at which most chemical reactions occur‚Äù Nature Magazine Center for Free-Electron Laser Science Hamburg Universit√© de Bordeaux Learn more: https://lnkd.in/e2_93C58 #chirality #electrons #uv #laser #sciart #ella_maru_studio #journalcover #phdlife #phd #sciencegirl #scicomm #womaninscience #medicalartist #sciencegirl"
