I owe my greatest debt to Richard L. Kagan, my mentor and advisor. While anyone who has had the privilege of working with Richard is familiar with his generous spirit and intellectual acumen, he played a particularly instrumental role in the development of this project. When I first met Richard as a graduate student, I was studying the medieval French Inquisition. I stumbled on the co-patronage controversy as a research paper topic in his seminar; in our meeting to discuss the paper, he told me that this would make an ideal dissertation topic. I reminded him that I was not an early modernist, that I didn’t really know anything about Spain, and that I didn’t speak a word of Spanish. He swept those concerns away with one hand gesture. And so I was off on the long adventure that has culminated in this book. I am grateful to many faculty members who provided invaluable advice and support throughout my graduate career at Johns Hopkins University, especially Gabrielle Spiegel, Judith Walkowitz, and David Nirenberg. The research for this book was made possible by generous grants from the Fulbright Program and the Program for Cultural Cooperation between the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports and United States Universities. I received support for additional research from the University of Oregon, the UO Department of History’s Spencer Brush Fund, and the American Philosophical Society’s Franklin Grant. Portions of this book have appeared previously in the Sixteenth Century Journal and the Catholic Historical Review. I am indebted to the generosity and knowledge of archivists and librarians throughout Castile—in particular, those at the Biblioteca Nacional, Real Academia de Historia, Biblioteca Universitaria de Sevilla, Archivo Catedralicio de Sevilla, and the Archivo Catedralicio de Santiago de Compostela—as well as the Archivio Segreto Vaticano. I have especially fond memories of my weeks\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$ACK\n\n12-07-10 14:35:12\n\nPS\n\nPAGE ix\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nworking in the Archivo Catedralicio de Santiago de Compostela, where te´cnico Arturo Iglesias provided invaluable help and advice. Ofelia Rey Castelao, professor at the University of Santiago de Compostela, shared her time, wisdom, and thorough knowledge of the ACSC with me. Like many American scholars, I was invited to participate in seminars and intellectual exchange at the Universidad Auto´noma by James Amelang. Finally, my initial research year in Madrid would have been far less fruitful without the friendship and advice of my lunch companions at the BNM, Sasha Pack and Tanya J. Tiffany. Most of this book was completed during the three years I spent at the University of Oregon. I thus owe several great debts to the UO and its Department of History for providing the perfect environment to nurture a young scholar. The two terms of leave I received were particularly valuable for the advancement of this project. I also received much advice and support from my colleagues, especially David Luebke, Ian McNeely, and Lisa Wolverton. My work was also greatly strengthened by the comments of an interdisciplinary group of early modernists at UO, of whom I would particularly like to thank Amanda Powell, Dianne DuGraw, James Harper, and Leah Middlebrook for their thoughtful responses to my chapter on gender. Nathalie Hester and Andrew Schulz brightened several gloomy Oregon winters with lively conversations about Spain and the Mediterranean, excellent meals, and warm friendship. I would also like to thank Nathalie for sharing with me her experience at the Archivio Segreto Vaticano. I am also grateful to Jesse, Laura, and Sophie Locker for showing me around Rome during my first research visit there in 2006. In the broader intellectual world, I would like to thank Jodi Bilinkoff, Katie Harris, Lu Ann Homza, Allyson Poska, Molly Warsh, Guy Lazure, Kimberly Lynn, Xavier Gil, and Kate van Liere for their many probing questions, advice, and suggestions. Katrina Olds spent many hours discussing Dextro with me, and shared her knowledge of the cathedral archives in Jae´n. Scholarship on Teresa of Avila can be dauntingly extensive and complex, but Teresian scholars are famously friendly and supportive to younger scholars. In addition to Jodi, I owe particular debts to Alison Weber and Christopher Wilson—their work and friendship have inspired and sustained me over the years. Trent Pomplun of Loyola College of Maryland provided invaluable aid in my journey through the labyrinth of canon law and the perinde valere. Finally, I am deeply grateful to two eminent scholars whose generosity and interest in my topic led them to seek me out with invaluable advice, recommendations, and support: Simon Ditchfield and Tony Thompson. Both Simon and Tony\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$ACK\n\n12-07-10 14:35:13\n\nPS\n\nPAGE x\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxi\n\nchallenged me to examine the co-patronage debate in a broader context by looking beyond Spain to the larger devotional landscape of seventeenth-century Europe. I also grateful to the editorial staff at PSU Press, especially Eleanor Goodman. I owe special thanks to my copyeditor, Suzanne Wolk, for her tireless work in clarifying and systematizing the complicated bibliography and to Kelly Johnston (UVa–The Scholar’s Lab) for extending his time so generously to helping me make the maps. I would also like to thank the two anonymous readers of the manuscript whose thoughtful and thorough comments helped me refine my thinking during the final stages of revision. A project of so many years would not have been possible without incurring a great number of personal as well as professional debts. My family always manifested patience and good humor with my saintly ramblings, particularly my parents, Richard and Cheryl Rowe, and my brother, Matthew. My father made a special trip with me to the quiet town of Alba de Tormes for the sole purpose of visiting Teresa’s sepulcher (where we viewed her heart). I am also grateful for the love and support of my family of friends, including Matthew Miller, Aviva Cristy, and the Howe-Kubiaks. Daniel and James Rowe imbued the last couple of years with a great joy that has supplied me with the energy to finish this project. In the end, however, I must dedicate this book to Andrew A. G. Ross, the best reader, editor, and friend I could have hoped for.\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$ACK\n\n12-07-10 14:35:13\n\nPS\n\nPAGE xi\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$ACK\n\n12-07-10 14:35:13\n\nPS\n\nPAGE xii\n\nAbbreviations\n\nACC ACSC ASV BAE BCC BNM Col.

The king, who was convalescing from a life-threatening illness, observed the main procession from a high window with full views of the streets. Crowds of people pushed into local churches to view the richly decorated images of the saint being honored, Teresa of Avila, and to listen to the royal musicians accompanying the mass. This festival marked the first official celebration of Teresa in her newly elected position as patron saint of Spain. Yet, in spite of the joyous events unfolding in Madrid, not everyone approved of this new spiritual representative. In fact, the cathedral chapters of Castile, headed by the powerful archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, had begun a campaign in the preceding weeks to prevent other cities of the kingdom from following Madrid’s example, in defiance of royal orders. The cathedral chapter’s efforts marked the beginning of a bitter three-year battle between those advocating Teresa’s patron sainthood and those who felt that her elevation alongside Spain’s existing patron, Santiago (Saint James the Greater), represented a grave insult both to the apostle and to Spain’s spiritual traditions. This book focuses on the period from 1617 to 1630, when the issue of who was or could be the patron saint of Spain burst onto the political and religious scene. Teresa and Santiago are two of the most iconic figures in Spanish cultural life; even today, they have maintained persistent and explicit associations with espan˜olidad (which can best be translated as ‘‘Spanishness’’). While both saints (Teresa especially) have received a great deal of scholarly attention, few studies have assessed their vital roles in historical-cultural imaginings of Spain.1 The conflict 1. For a notable exception, see Carlos Eire’s discussion of Teresa’s espan˜olidad in From Madrid to Purgatory: The Art and Craft of Dying in Sixteenth-Century Spain (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 379–82.\n\n................. 17923$\n\nINTR\n\n12-07-10 15:17:28\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 1\n\n2\n\nSaint and Nation\n\nover their patron sainthood signified a seminal moment in Spanish history because Teresa’s ascendancy marks the first substantial challenge to Santiago since the High Middle Ages, and suggests a shift in Spanish political, spiritual, and ideological culture. Teresa’s elevation to copatron saint proved alarming to many Castilians because it challenged not just Santiago’s cult but traditional understandings of the Spanish nation. It interrupted the accepted historical narrative touted by Santiago’s devotees to create what was, for the most part, a new historicalspiritual narrative, with new foundations. This new narrative was bound to recent events and current problems facing the nation—spiritual, political, and cultural. The largest of such events was a gradual geopolitical shift from perennial conflict with Muslims (reconquest) to a more multifaceted and spiritual conflict within Christianity (European religious wars). At the same time, the Spanish monarchy began to lose ground in its struggle to maintain hegemony in Europe. What on the surface may seem to be a simple devotional decision to name Teresa the national patron took on extraordinary importance to contemporary Castilians, who viewed the results of this decision as potentially cataclysmic. This book investigates the cultural, social, and spiritual stakes for participants. At the heart of the controversy lay the idea of Spain itself, as national patron sainthood presented Castilians with an opportunity to imagine and contest their relationship to the larger national community, in much the same way that local saints had supplied a way to express local identities.2 As Simon Ditchfield has recently argued, ‘‘when early modern Catholics wanted to express their collective identity or articulate their collective memory, more often than not they did so in terms of their devotion to their local churches whose holy custodians were the saints.’’3 Early modern historians have been quick to assess such expressions of collective identity and sanctity in the context of civic identities, yet the national level has been largely overlooked.4 2.

Both types of saints played a variety of important roles in the spiritual and cultural lives of medieval people. They could act as intercessors between human beings and God on behalf of a petitioner, whether individual or corporate. They could serve as patrons entrusted with the protection of lands under their patronage: Patrons stopped floods, drove away locusts, and brought generous harvests.5 Some were associated with particular problems—Saint Roch, for example, was often called upon in times of plague. Saints could also serve as examples, either as inspiration or as models for ideal Christian behavior. But not all hagiographers expected their readers to pattern their lives after the saints— for some it was enough to present the saint’s life as a demonstration of God’s power and the wonder of his miracles.6 Finally, saints fulfilled a central theological role in the Catholic Church: The incorruption of their bodies offered tangible proof of the ultimate triumph over death promised to all Christians through the resurrection of the body as part of the Last Judgment.7 Thus saints played multiple roles within Christian society, which fluctuated depending on the specific historical, political, religious, or cultural contexts. National patron sainthood began to develop slowly during the Middle Ages, when we begin to see the emergence of such figures as Santiago in Castile, Saint George in England and Catalonia, and Saint Denis in France. I should say here that the word ‘‘nation,’’ as it was understood throughout this period, derived its meaning from its Latin origins—natio, a vague term loosely connecting people from the same region who shared customs, history, and possibly language. Such national patrons acted much as local patrons did, though they reached out beyond a limited geographic range. Both national and civic patrons interceded on behalf of a specific space while simultaneously being tied deeply to a sense of place, embedded in shared histories and memories.8 The saints’ 5.

Kagan, with Fernando Marı´as, Urban Images of the Hispanic World, 1493–1793 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000). Kagan contends, ‘‘Place, moreover, is (quoting the German philosopher Heidegger) a ‘gathering of meanings,’ the locus where memory, history, and collective experience intertwine’’ (17). See also Clare A. Lees and Gillian R. Overing, eds., A Place to Believe In: Locating Medieval Landscapes (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006).\n\n................. 17923$\n\nINTR\n\n12-07-10 15:17:28\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 3\n\n4\n\nSaint and Nation\n\nrelationship to place constituted a key factor in their mutability into symbols of civic and national identity. National patron saints took on new meaning in the early modern period, as monarchies drew more closely together through literacy and the printing press, mobility of people, centralized bureaucracy, and, increasingly, the fixing of territorial boundaries.9 National patrons thus became embedded in the histories of the peoples they came to represent, often playing pivotal roles in the preservation or defense of the nation at moments of crisis. They also became associated with values and characteristics that those in the national community held as fundamental to their identities during a given period of time. The use of saints for expressing collective identity or memory connected liturgical time with historical time. The liturgy brings the past into the present through an ongoing celebration of a cycle of events. Key to this process is the belief that the sacred is made present through such celebrations; for example, the liturgy for a saint’s feast day commemorates the deeds and miracles of the holy person who lived in the past, while simultaneously appealing to the saint’s power and presence for protection in the immediate present or future.10 Thus the celebration of specific saints’ feast days renders the distant past deeply relevant and immediately present, while providing hope for the future. Communities eagerly adopted such understandings of time and place in the celebration of their patron saints. As William Christian contends, shrines and relics, establishing sacred geography and ‘‘outlasting individuals as they do, come to stand not only for the pueblo of the moment, but also for the eternal pueblo.’’11 Through its sacred geography, a community could obtain permanence and immortality, which mirrored the immortality promised to all Christians. Saints thus became part of larger discussions about the future and direction of the nation, which included a diverse variety of economic and political policies from a range of both regional and national perspectives. The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries marked a period of profound shift in the Spanish zeitgeist—the fiscal burdens and moral complications of empire, along with the changing political situation in 9. As part of the general lack of attention paid to national patron saints, historians have spent little time exploring this subject in the context of medieval history, in spite of the presence of many significant ‘‘national’’ patrons. A comparison of national patron sainthood in the Middle Ages and the early modern period might prove extremely fruitful. 10. The ‘‘presentness’’ of sacred objects and texts (and their place in the liturgy) has been much commented on by historians, particularly medievalists. Peter Brown argues, ‘‘When the passio was read [as part of the liturgy], the saint was ‘really’ there.’’ Cult of the Saints, 81–82. 11.

Copatronage participants engaged in a sophisticated negotiation of plural identities through the dynamic interplay between traditional binaries: local and extralocal, royal authority and nation, tradition and modernity, church and state, and masculine and feminine. The idea of plurality in early modern Spain has become an important new area for study. James Amelang has recently noted that while plurality characterized the monarchy, it existed alongside unity.13 The two forces worked together, not in opposition. My work offers an in-depth case study that exposes the multilayered nature of early modern ideas, structures, and identities. Co-patronage affords an ideal vantage point from which to examine plurality, because the conflict was not just about rhetoric or ideals but also about power, since a patron saint could act as a vehicle through which individuals or institutions could acquire or augment power. As Xavier Gil Pujol astutely observes, one of the main sources of power in early modern Iberia was jurisdiction.14 Since privilege and jurisdiction provided the main channels through which people demarcated and defended their individual or communal power, they often became sites of fierce contestation. Thus what we see in the co-patronage debate is a struggle over ideals and values, but also over jurisdiction—specifically, over who had the right to name and to celebrate a patron—and therefore power. In addition, disputes over local privilege, royal authority, and ecclesiastical rights in the co-patronage debate reveal plural discussions about the nation, its meaning and values, in early modern Castile.15 Nevertheless, while co-patronage touched off explosive disagreements 12. The problem particularly of identity, empire, and gender has begun to be explored with fascinating results by literary scholars; see especially Sidney Donnell, Feminizing the Enemy: Imperial Spain, Transvestite Drama, and the Crisis of Masculinity (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 2003); and Barbara Fuchs, Passing for Spain: Cervantes and the Fictions of Identity (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2003). 13.

The evolution of the court system in Castile made litigiousness a key characteristic of jurisdictional battles; the co-patronage debate proved no exception, spawning numerous legal complaints (pleitos) as well as polemical tracts and sermons.

Hence, even when the nation was a contested category, it could still cohere. Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, Castile was beset by a series of misfortunes. While not without interludes of calm and prosperity, the Spanish monarchy faced an onslaught of crises and disasters for which its members scrambled to find solutions. These solutions could be, and often were, simultaneously pragmatic and ideological, ranging from resisting the devaluation of coinage to preventing Spanish men from becoming too ‘‘effeminate.’’ Economic, political, social, and religious remedies to the problems facing Spain consumed the minds of the educated class. Many of these men—like Pedro de Ribadeneira, Juan de Mariana, and Sancho de Moncada, to name a few— produced printed treatises that were sent to the court as advice for the king and circulated among officials and courtiers. The proliferation of such treatises and their widespread dissemination demonstrate the variety of ways in which the country’s elite attempted to strengthen the monarchy or to stave off what some referred to as its decline. This outpouring of political writing has not escaped the attention of historians, many of whom have studied in great detail both the individual men involved in the production of such works and the rhetoric they deployed to describe their country, its problems, and potential remedies.16 The movement to have Teresa elevated to co-patron must be understood in the context of this larger attempt to discover potential remedies for the ills of the monarchy and of Castile in particular. Since patron saints played critical roles in the protection of the places they represented, anxieties over the choice of national patron attended larger anxieties about the state of the monarchy. Seventeenth-century writers advocating both for and against co-patronage invoked the existing language of economic and political reform by framing the debate explicitly within the context of what would be best for the monarchy. They argued fiercely over how Teresa’s elevation might add to or detract from the ultimate goal of keeping Spain strong. At first glance, the spiritual choice of an additional patron 16.

A closer examination of such treatises reveals that they often discussed the problems of the monarchy in terms of divine punishment and debated supernatural as well as practical remedies. The significance of choosing a new patron saint would have been immediately recognizable to contemporaries as integral to the monarchy’s future and well-being. We see, therefore, that polemics on the choice of a new patron saint grabbed the attention of many leading political and spiritual figures of the day. Both Philip III and Philip IV took an active interest in promoting Teresa’s co-patronage, as did Philip IV’s powerful minister, the countduke of Olivares. Some of the greatest literary figures of Golden Age Spain leapt into the fray, including Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas, the humanist and painter Francisco de Pacheco (Vela´zquez’s father-in-law), Lope de Vega, and the royal chronicler Toma´s Tamayo y Vargas, as well as a host of other prominent political and economic writers. Teresa’s elevation was voted on twice by the representative assembly of Castile (the Cortes), and twice more by the kingdom’s ecclesiastical representative assembly. In addition, the most powerful prelates in Castile weighed in on the issue, including the archbishops of Santiago, Toledo, and Seville—most notably among these the influential archbishop of Seville, Pedro de Castro. Participants both famous and obscure wrote prolifically on the controversy: Almost one hundred treatises and sermons printed and circulated by both sides of the issue survive, most produced between 1627 and 1629. These treatises were also disseminated widely, enabling participants to respond directly to their adversaries and creating a written debate. Such broad circulation was aided by the widespread practice of printing cheap pamphlets, which allowed materials to be circulated quickly across a wide geographic span.17 For example, one co-patronage author, Francisco Morovelli de Puebla, claimed that he had fired off his pro-Teresa treatise in seven days after reading no fewer than nine pamphlets debating her elevation.18 Writers maintained a direct dialogue with one another, at times quoting their opponents verbatim. 17.

The majority of participants came from the gentry, which was at the time (as in other European kingdoms) the rising class of university-trained ‘‘new men’’ who held prominent positions in local and royal bureaucracies. This group of educated and socially mobile Castilians wrote prolifically on the major issues confronting their monarchy. Scholars have often located the origins of nationalism and the nation-state in the works of such men; Liah Greenfeld, for example, finds English nationalism developing in the sixteenth century as the direct result of this specific group of socially mobile men redefining nobility in terms of service.19 While I do not wish to make such a broad claim for these Castilians, it is noteworthy that nearly all the participants in the co-patronage debate came from families associated with lower branches of the nobility and local elites, rather than from the artisan class, the peasantry, or the highest aristocracy, who remained largely absent from the debate. The failure of historians to understand the broad appeal and political significance of the co-patronage debate explains its virtual absence from modern historiography. One tends to find brief discussions of the debate in works on key figures—most prominently, Francisco de Quevedo, Teresa, and Santiago.20 Such treatments of the debate hinder our comprehensive understanding of its wider significance. For example, Isaı´as Rodrı´guez’s study of Teresian spirituality provides an excellent basic chronology of the debate as well as references to some of the primary material, but it does so almost solely from a teresiano perspective; the viewpoint of Santiago’s supporters is consequently eclipsed.21 The lack of attention to the co-patronage debate within the vibrant historiography on Saint Teresa is largely a by-product of scholars’ emphasis on the life 19.

Elliott, I. A. A. Thompson, and M. J. Rodrı´guez-Salgado—have made important contributions to the co-patronage debate by assessing it as a sign of an identity crisis in Castile, although they have not explored the topic in detail.24 Such discussions tend to be embedded in works on political culture in Castile, since, in spite of the rhetoric about ‘‘Spain’’ in the debate, co-patronage remained a staunchly Castilian problem, reflecting Castilian concerns in pamphlets written by Castilians. But even within Castile, the various regions and individual cities expressed multilayered attitudes about their own rights and privileges and those of the Crown; neither unstintingly loyal to the monarchy and royal policies nor unable to see over their town walls, Castilian cities and their leaders played an important role in imagining and developing a national community.25 22.

What did the title ‘‘patron saint of Spain’’ mean to them? The title is not a modern imposition on the past but reflects the language employed by participants in the debate. Seventeenth-century Castilians had a wide variety of terms with which to describe both Castile and the wider monarchy. Throughout treatises on both sides of the debate, for example, the terms ‘‘Spanish monarchy’’ (monarquı´a espan˜ola), ‘‘Spains’’ (las Espan˜as), ‘‘Spain’’ (Espan˜a), ‘‘Hispania’’ (Hispania), ‘‘the Crown(s) of Castile’’ (la[s] Corona[s] de Castilla), and ‘‘the kingdom(s) of Castile’’ (el reino/los reinos de Castilla) are used in ways that at first glance seem almost interchangeable to modern eyes. But these terms are not interchangeable, and early modern authors often used them with great precision.26 We can divide these terms roughly into two categories: The first category refers to concrete juridical-political or territorial units, while the second invokes what may be called an idealized or imagined community.27 In the first category one may place the terms ‘‘Spanish monarchy,’’ ‘‘the Spains,’’ and ‘‘the Crown and kingdoms of Castile,’’ since all refer to existing divisions of Spanish territories. The Spanish monarchy, naturally, refers to the entirety of Spanish holdings, including the entire Iberian Peninsula, the Low Countries, the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, and the American colonies. ‘‘The Spains,’’ while an awkward term in English, was frequently used in early modern Spain to denote the Iberian kingdoms, which comprise modern-day Spain (Castile, Arago´n, and Navarre); it also occasionally included Portugal (part of the Spanish monarchy from 1580 to 1640). At the time of the debate, these kingdoms were loosely connected by a common monarch but had separate governments, laws, and customs. The Crown(s) of Castile, whether singular or plural, included Old and New Castile, Leo´n, Andalusia, Asturias, and Jose´ I. Fortea Pe´rez, ‘‘Las ciudades, las Cortes y el problema de la representacio´n polı´tica en la Castilla moderna,’’ in Ima´genes de la diversidad: El mundo urbano en la corona de Castilla, ed. Jose´ I.

Thompson, Crown and Cortes: Government, Institutions, and Representation in Early Modern Castile (Aldershot: Ashgate Variorum, 1993). 26. While these terms are generally used with precision in co-patronage treatises, Richard Kagan points out a degree of slippage in the work of other authors. See Kagan, ‘‘Nacio´n y patria en la historiografı´a de la e´poca austriaca,’’ in Le sentiment national dans l’Europe me´ridionale au XVIe et XVIIe sie`cles, ed. Alain Tallon (Madrid: Casa de Vela´zquez, 2007), 205–6. 27. While the phrase ‘‘imagined community’’ comes from Benedict Anderson, I have been inspired here more by the work of Michael Walzer, who argued, ‘‘The state is invisible; it must be personified before it can be seen, symbolized before it can be loved, imagined before it can be conceived.’’ Walzer, ‘‘On the Role of Symbolism in Political Thought,’’ Political Science Quarterly 82, no. 2 (1967): 194.\n\n................. 17923$\n\nINTR\n\n12-07-10 15:17:32\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 10\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nGalicia. Each of these Castilian Crowns represented distinct regions with differing histories and customs, though they were unified by one law. In the second category of community—the idealized or imagined— one finds both ‘‘Spain,’’ and ‘‘Hispania,’’ neither of which reflected a political entity but rather what is better understood as an imagined site full of cultural and historical resonance. Hispania, the Latin name for the Spanish province (‘‘Espan˜a’’ was the term rendered in the vernacular), hearkened back to the unified kingdom of Spain and an idealized time before the Moorish invasions of 711, which fragmented and destroyed the Visigothic Kingdom. For the next seven centuries, the political leaders of Christian Spain worked (in a piecemeal fashion) to take territory from their Islamic neighbors. As they did so, new political states began to emerge, eventually resulting in the disparate kingdoms of Portugal, Castile-Leo´n, and Arago´n-Catalonia. The ‘‘Spain’’ of the ancient world no longer existed, though it endured in the memories of Christian leaders of these Iberian kingdoms, several of whom attempted to resurrect the imperial title assumed by the Visigoths—emperor of all Spain.28 One can trace throughout Spanish history a tension between the political reality of distinct kingdoms and the historical memory of ‘‘Spain.’’ Another way to describe Spain during the early modern period was with the term nacio´n. This term retained much of its medieval resonance in the early modern period; since the word referred to a community of people from a general region, it possessed a certain plasticity that did not necessarily connote alignment with a political state. For Castilians, nacio´n referred to the Spanish nation (nacio´n espan˜ola); it is clear from their usage that the nation comprised more than just Castile. For example, one author referred to the veneration of Santiago ‘‘throughout our entire nation’’ in a sentence that referred explicitly to the pilgrimage site of the Virgin of the Pillar in Arago´n.29 Another santiaguista author denounced a sermon by an opponent who spoke in favor of displacing Santiago with Teresa; he declared that this opponent ‘‘deserved to lose his Spanish nationality [la naturaleza de Espan˜a], not only for publishing this idea, but for thinking it, which is an insult to the whole nation!’’30 The union of the terms ‘‘nation’’ and ‘‘Spain’’ indicates that references to Spain connoted nationhood. In addition, authors using the term 28. Joseph F.

At the dawn of the seventeenth century, patria largely retained its sixteenth-century meaning of ‘‘hometown’’ or region of one’s birth.33 Yet Xavier Gil Pujol has demonstrated that by the close of the century writers employed the same term to refer to the nation—to Spain, a place that united people with a common history and to which people owed their primary loyalty.34 Although early seventeenth-century Castilians did not conceive of Spain as a nation in the modern sense of a sovereign political entity, the common use of the terms nacio´n, patria, and repu´blica reflected a growing sense of political and cultural loyalty to a specific territory. Thus the battle over the patron saint of Spain remains embedded in a larger process through which early modern Castilians began to conceptualize the nation in a way that permitted the development of national consciousness. The complexities involved in discussing the ‘‘nation’’ in medieval and early modern Europe have given rise to vigorous debate among historians.35 Some early modernists have taken exception to arguments by modern historians that posit the origins of nationalism (and the nation) in the late eighteenth century, asserting instead that early modern states did in fact demonstrate an incipient nationalism.36 Others have 31.

The larger question of exactly how early modern peoples imagined and understood the nation remains understudied. The nation during the early modern period was a messy concept, straddling both the older, medieval understanding of a natio and a newer, more politicized meaning encompassing sovereignty. I argue that it is necessary to explore precisely what early modern writers intended when they used the word ‘‘nation.’’ Historians and political scientists, most famously Anthony Smith, have also noted the centrality of religious symbols and rhetoric in the development of national identities before the eighteenth century.38 Eric Olsen presents a provocative reworking of nationalism and nationalist movements in early modern Europe, which he connects to strands of medieval millenarianism, including messianism. One of the most important aspects of messianism in the context of nationalism is its emphasis on the monarchy’s unique role in God’s plan. This type of particularism countered the universalism of Catholicism and permitted the Spanish monarchy to see itself as the only true defender of the faith in Europe; we can see from a transnational perspective that the Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English all represented themselves as chosen peoples in the early modern era. The application of the Old Testament depiction of the Hebrew people to early modern national discourses served the key purpose of permitting a transition between the loose medieval understanding of a nation into a more rigidly fixed and politicized geographical and cultural entity. Central to such a transition was the distinctive destiny of the chosen people, a specific group not only imbued with superior virtue and ability but also granted God’s special grace and a promise of territorial domination over neighbors. It is not surprising that a messianic ideology that could be easily linked to territorial domination would prove popular during an era when monarchies were consolidating their authority and forming global empires. Thus the sacred played a that even if broad-based participation in the nation was not possible before the eighteenth century, ‘‘nationalist’’ sentiments were expressed by the politically and economically dominant sector of society, which had the effect of creating a nation in potentia (8–9). 37.

It is not my intention, however, to argue that discussions of the nation in the seventeenth century proceeded uniformly and progressively to the eighteenth-century development of nationalism. In fact, I reject the notion of the development of the nation-state as a linear process.39 Identities and experiences remain fluid and plastic throughout history; in the early modern era, fluidity was encouraged by the easy movement of peoples, ideas, culture, and identities. In contrast, proponents of nationalist ideologies generally portray national identities as fixed and stable.40 Historians must struggle to read behind and beyond discourses of national identities, both past and present, in order to view the more complicated reality. For example, in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Castile, one ideological goal of many historians was to erase or ‘‘conquer’’ the Moorish past, which they viewed as a disruption or aberration in Spain’s glorious Christian tradition; while such efforts were most obvious in Andalusia, they echoed throughout the kingdom.41 Yet, in recent work, Andrew Schulz demonstrates that eighteenth-century Spain saw an upsurge in reclaiming and celebrating its Moorish heritage.42 Rather than understand the Moorish presence as an interruption of Spain’s grand national narrative, some eighteenthcentury artists and writers saw it as part of Spanish history and identity. Thus Spain’s national story could and did change over time. Spain provides a particularly intriguing and complex perspective on issues of national community. The attempt to create a patron saint of ‘‘Spain’’ at a time when Spain did not exist politically fostered a sense of connection among Spaniards, performed through the celebration of patron sainthood. Every major city was ordered to celebrate Teresa as patron with public processions and festivals; no matter how the viewing public may have reacted to these processions, people were exposed through them to a variety of images and types of rhetoric about royal power, Spain, and what it meant to be Spanish. At the same time, the 39. See David A. Bell, ‘‘Review: Recent Works on Early Modern French National Identity,’’ Journal of Modern History 68, no. 1 (1996): 101. 40. Experiences of twentieth-century Spain have had a profound effect in shaping the way historians understand and interpret Spain’s past.

Since nationhood in early modern Europe relied on the experience of a shared past, both sides of the debate eagerly promoted narratives of the Spanish past in which their saint played an integral role. But it is important to emphasize that even though the king had a large stake in such narratives, the nation did not necessarily support royal aims and was not inevitably controlled by the monarch. The Spanish nation was not synonymous with the Spanish monarchy, and it could even be used as a method of resisting royal policies. The phrase ‘‘patron saint of Spain’’ raises many questions that are not easily answered. Of what exactly had Teresa been made patron saint? Castile? Spain? The Spanish monarchy? Participants disagreed bitterly over the geographic jurisdiction of Teresa’s patron sainthood. These questions reflect even greater uncertainty over whom exactly Teresa represented in her spiritual advocacy. The Spanish people? The king? The interests of the monarchy? All of these? A close reading of the debate reveals a variety of attempts to answer these questions, directly or indirectly; we see a wealth of possible interpretations from Castilians about how they viewed themselves in relationship to town, nation, and monarchy. Teresa’s patron sainthood could be tied to the person of Philip IV and the Habsburg dynasty exclusively, to the idea of a Spanish nation utterly distinct from the monarchy, to a new civic communal identity that militated against an older medieval understanding of universal Christianitas, or to an offense against local pride or the privilege of a specific class or group (specifically, the privilege of the clergy). The coexistence of such disparate understandings of the nation demonstrates the elasticity of nation and identity in early modern Europe.43 At the same time, elasticity does not necessarily entail fragmentation or incoherence. This study examines the key elements of the Spanish nation and identity that were assumed and shared by both sides of the controversy over patron sainthood. The book begins by tracing two developments in Castilian history that were fundamental to the shaping of the Castilian past: the origins and growth of devotion to the apostle Santiago in medieval Castile, and sixteenth-century Castilian accounts of national foundations. I investigate how Santiago’s slow evolution as the patron saint of Spain created 43.

Through this process, ideological, spiritual, and political conceptions of the nation of ‘‘Spain’’ deepened into an increasingly salient national consciousness in early modern Iberia. I further assess the controversy that unfolded when, by the end of the sixteenth century, Santiago and his foundational place in Spanish history became open to question and doubt. Chapter 2 addresses how international scandal and domestic doubts concerning Santiago’s continued efficacy as patron saint created a space that permitted a growing movement centered around another seminal Castilian saint: Teresa of Avila. This chapter briefly traces Teresa’s life, career, and monumental popularity after her death in 1582. It discusses the first Carmelite efforts to have Teresa made co-patron saint of Spain in 1617–18 and the heated controversy that followed. The intensity of devotion to Teresa during this period stemmed largely from the lived experience of her holiness by contemporary Castilian people who met, saw, spoke with, or were miraculously cured by her—she was, as they described it, ‘‘modern.’’ In addition, Teresa’s supporters expounded the belief that, as a native of Spain, she would intercede more powerfully for her nation than would a foreign saint. Her supporters quickly found new and inventive ways of fashioning Teresa, no less than Santiago, as a crucial part of Spain’s mythic past and messianic destiny, while reshaping the older historical narrative in favor of a modern one. In the third chapter I investigate the issue of political and royal involvement in the co-patronage controversy, which became important in the second phase of the debate (1627–30). The new king, Philip IV, and his powerful chief minister, the count-duke of Olivares, seized the opportunities provided by Teresa’s election to promote royal propaganda. Yet their support for this controversial election allowed those hostile to royal policies generally, and to Olivares more specifically, to transform the co-patronage debate into a platform for political attack. I argue that early modern political writers could invoke the nation as a method of protecting traditional rights and providing a check to royal authority. Thus, while the king could (and did) use patron sainthood to consolidate authority with new symbolic propaganda, other groups could also mobilize their patron for the purposes of resistance and criticism. The inchoate nature of the nation during the early modern period allowed it to be employed simultaneously for multiple, and opposing, purposes.\n\n................. 17923$\n\nINTR\n\n12-07-10 15:17:36\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 16\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nChapter 4 turns to the symbolic role that patron saints played in representing their kingdom on an international stage as embodiments of the monarch’s foreign policy. Specifically, I analyze how foreign policy and gender collided in the co-patronage debate as Teresa’s femininity provoked anxiety over her ability to fulfill her new role as guardian of Spain’s international reputation. Reason-of-state theorists privileged international reputation as vital for the efficacy of foreign policy and the maintenance of Spain’s hegemony in Europe; patron sainthood thus became central to representing and maintaining Spain’s reputation, as well as embodying concrete policies. Opponents of Teresa’s election insisted that representation by a woman would lead to international ridicule. In response, some of her supporters constructed a powerful argument that a new saint was necessary to combat contemporary problems facing the monarchy. They viewed the Moorslayer as an increasingly obsolete cultural symbol and instead advocated in favor of Teresa as a warrior against heresy and a promoter of internal reform. In chapter 5 the discussion turns to the question of who exactly might have embraced such a vision of Teresa. The focus moves from external to internal here, as I ‘‘map’’ support for Teresa’s co-patronage along regional lines within Castile. The vital symbolic function of patron saints in early modern civic and religious culture led to powerful connections to local patrons. Local elites in the early modern period were busily constructing local narratives and identities based on local cults. Attempts to introduce a national patron into a city or town could (and did) result in outrage and rejection. Yet it would be a misreading of seventeenthcentury Castile to see such outrage as a triumph of localism over centralized authority. Cities and towns often integrated themselves into a larger national context, even as they fought to protect local interests. I present Andalusia as an extended case study in this chapter, as both regional identities and the clash over co-patronage were particularly fierce in this region. In addition to increasing tensions between local and national cults, the co-patronage debate shed light on the growing uses of saints for civic rather than ecclesiastical purposes. Chapter 6 addresses the tension between beliefs that national patron sainthood remained solely the prerogative of the church and new understandings of it as primarily communicentric in nature. This chapter develops the clashes between Castilian churches and royal and secular authority, as many churches sought to advance their own unique interests, occasionally at the expense of royal authority. Yet churches did not necessarily invoke the ancient privileges of the ecclesiastical estate in order to promote papal\n\n................. 17923$\n\nINTR\n\n12-07-10 15:17:36\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 17\n\n18\n\nSaint and Nation\n\npower or a vision of the universal church. Rather, local churches more often than not advanced local (and sometimes national) issues. To complicate the ecclesiastical picture, prelates (in contrast to cathedral chapters) inhabited a middle ground, sometimes backing their chapter and sometimes throwing their support behind the king. This chapter argues that expanded state power in the early modern period led to increasingly national churches, whether they promoted local, royal, or national interests. Bitter division over who should control patron sainthood—the nation or the church—proved controversial not only on the national but on the international level as well. In the final chapter the debate relocates to Rome, where a group of ambassadors representing the cathedral chapter of Santiago de Compostela began to campaign for the repeal of the 1627 papal brief, following a stalemate back in Spain. The resolution of a national dispute in an international context highlights the fundamental but understudied way in which the papacy used its ecclesiastical authority to bolster its position in international affairs. Chapter 7 also draws on multiple case studies of conflicts over patron saints and cultic devotion outside Spain in order to demonstrate that increasing nationalization of patron sainthood was occurring throughout early modern Europe, in spite of the papacy’s efforts to maintain control. The picture that emerges from the diverse and complex issues put forth in these chapters is of national consciousness surfacing during a time of turbulence and change. What is fascinating about the co-patronage debate is that it signals a process more complex than the substitution of one set of cultural values for another. The bitter wrangling over Teresa’s elevation reveals the depth of the crisis that had developed in early seventeenth-century Castilian political and spiritual life over the future of the nation and its goals and values. Those supporting the new patron saint viewed the role of mythic origins as increasingly obsolete in the world of the Renaissance and Reformation, a world fraught with religious conflict and a changing political landscape. Teresa’s supporters shifted the location of Spain’s salvation from the distant past to the recent present; in doing so, they fashioned a new vision of the Spanish nation in which faith was preserved not by protection in battle but by internal piety and reform. The opponents of Teresa’s elevation, by contrast, argued forcefully that any changes to the national narrative would lead to disastrous results—the apostle would turn his back on them, their policies would fail, and Spain would lose its place of primacy in the world. Yet failure and disaster came for the monarchy, with or without\n\n................. 17923$\n\nINTR\n\n12-07-10 15:17:37\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 18\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nSantiago’s singular patron sainthood, and new national narratives were crafted in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Though medieval and early modern authors generally grounded stories of origins in Genesis, many peoples recounted additional stories based on ancient mythology or distant historical events. Such stories were various, layered, and evolved over time; Colette Beaune’s recognition of a ‘‘plurality of founding heroes’’ in France can be seen throughout Europe.1 Interest in origins intensified during the Renaissance as history writing as a genre developed and deepened.2 In sixteenth-century Castile, a series of medieval legends about the apostle Saint James (Santiago) and his close relationship with the Spanish people became progressively fused to histories of Spain’s spiritual foundation. Through this process, ideological, spiritual, and political conceptions of the nation of ‘‘Spain’’ strengthened into an increasingly salient national consciousness. This chapter examines this complex process by assessing how Santiago’s slow evolution as the patron saint of Spain created a crucial place for the 1.

While Santiago’s patron sainthood is often seen from a modern vantage point as a fixed feature of Iberian history, it was in fact slow, incomplete, and contested. The story of Saint James and his connection to the Spanish nation began in the ninth century with a glow of radiant light—a cluster of shooting stars illuminating the blue-black sky. Shepherds grazing their sheep nearby looked up in awe and wonder; they were immediately aware that this mysterious celestial activity was a divine portent, like the comet that heralded the birth of Jesus. They discussed the events among themselves, and eventually their whispers reached the ears of the local bishop, Theodemir (d. 847), who decided to investigate the mysterious occurrence. Proceeding to the large, empty field over which the stars had fallen, the bishop and his men discovered the ruins of an ancient sepulcher. They knew at once what they had uncovered: the tomb of Saint James the Greater, one of the twelve apostles, first among them to be martyred in the years immediately following the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ.3 Legends had circulated that James had been sent to the province of Hispania to evangelize before his martyrdom; it therefore did not surprise Theodemir that after his death he would return to the land he converted.4 In honor of the newly discovered relics, the bishop built a simple chapel to house them and to mark the site for pilgrims; within a few centuries, the chapel evolved into a cathedral and the empty field into one of the greatest pilgrimage sites in the medieval Christian world—Santiago de Compostela. The locals who housed and protected the apostle’s relics began to develop a special relationship with the apostle. They eventually began to call him ‘‘Santiago,’’ a vernacular contraction of his name in Latin, Sanctus Iacobus. The miraculous translation of Santiago’s relics from the Holy Land, where he had been martyred, to an isolated field in the remote corner of the Iberian Peninsula was a sign to the local Christians that they had been offered a special relationship with the apostle. The protection of a powerful apostle could not have come at a better time for the besieged residents of the northern peninsula. The once great Visigothic kingdom of Hispania, built out of the former Roman province, had fallen to the Arab and Berber army of the Umayyad Caliphate in the early 700s, a century before the discovery of Saint James’s relics. 3.

Very quickly, however, Christian forces rallied under the nobility of Asturias-Leo´n and carved out a precarious kingdom on the northern edges of Islamic Spain. They began a series of periodic incursions southward to increase their landholdings; this long epoch of intermittent warfare—the so-called reconquest—spanned seven centuries, ca. 722–1492. During this long period, Santiago became increasingly associated with aiding Christian forces against their Islamic enemies. His first dramatic act of protection for Christian forces occurred during the battle of Clavijo in the ninth century (834/844).5 According to the legend, the night before a battle against the overwhelming numbers of the Islamic army, Ramiro I, the king of Asturias-Leo´n, knelt in prayer to ask God for a victory against his stronger and more numerous enemies. The following day, the king’s prayers were answered: The sky opened, and Santiago descended from heaven on a brilliant white horse, holding aloft a sword. The miraculous apparition caused fear and chaos among the enemy, while Ramiro’s army gained courage, slaying seventy thousand enemy soldiers. Ramiro and his emerging kingdom vowed never to forget what Santiago had done for them; Ramiro’s armies took the words the apostle had taught them for their battle cry: ‘‘God and Santiago, help us!’’6 These three stories—of Santiago’s evangelization, translation, and apparition—encompass the central legends concerning the apostle and the Spanish kingdoms. While these legends fit together smoothly, each has its own distinct history dating from the Middle Ages. Historians have struggled to untangle when, why, and from which sources these stories appeared. The clearest picture we can form from the fragmented source material indicates that the belief that Santiago had been assigned the province of Spain for the purposes of evangelizing surfaced as early as the seventh century; a breviary of Greek origin translated into Latin, the Breviarium apostolorum (Apostolic breviary), stated unequivocally, 5. Historians disagree over the exact date of the battle, usually putting it somewhere between 834 and 844; 844 is the year that King Ramiro granted Santiago a privilege in thanksgiving for his aid in the battle, though the battle is traditionally dated to 834. The former date reinforces the historical improbability of the battle; almost all modern historians accept the fictional origins of both the battle and the privilege. For one example, see Roger Collins, Early Medieval Spain: Unity in Diversity, 400–1000 (London: Macmillan, 1983), 237. 6. Detailed versions of the battle of Clavijo began to appear in the thirteenth century.

Isidore of Seville (d. 636), for example, remarked on Santiago’s Spanish visit in one of his works but neglected it in others.9 Despite such references to Santiago’s preaching in Spain, medieval Castilian texts instead chose to emphasize the presence of the apostolic relics and the pilgrimage site. Although this discovery dated to the ninth century, the location in a remote corner of the Iberian Peninsula created difficulties in attracting large numbers of pilgrims. Claiming the entire corpus of an apostle and martyr, as Compostela did, conferred enormous prestige on the shrine. An ambitious Galician prelate, Diego Gelmı´rez (d. 1140), worked tirelessly to improve the international reputation of his church and shrine; during his prelacy, the pilgrimage route to Compostela along the northern coast took on new life, thanks in large part to Gelmı´rez’s close ties the Benedictine monks of Cluny, who sponsored a series of monasteries along the route to provide housing for pilgrims. Once the Cluniac monasteries provided the route with basic infrastructure, Compostela rapidly gained international popularity in the High Middle Ages, eventually becoming Europe’s second major pilgrimage site, after Rome.10 In one of his most lasting accomplishments, Gelmı´rez succeeded in having the see at Compostela elevated to an archbishopric. In order to solidify and preserve the cathedral’s privileges for subsequent generations, the archbishop commissioned a four-volume work called the Historia compostellana (History of Compostela), which detailed the history of the discovery of the relics and growth of the shrine.11 7. ‘‘Jacobus qui interpretatur subplantator filius Zebedei frater Johannis.

Early medieval cults tended to spring up around relics rather than individuals, although devotions sometimes did arise from the sepulcher of a local holy person whose body remained attached to the place in which he or she had lived. Though such local connections were an important aspect of medieval piety, the number of relics far exceeded the number of local holy people. It is worth remembering that every church was under an obligation to house the relics of a saint under its altar. This necessity, along with the practice of dismembering holy bodies and the lively trade in false relics, meant that relics could travel from one end of Christendom to the other. The higher the saint in the heavenly hierarchy, the more coveted the relics would become on the market.13 Thus many medieval churches housed cherished relics of saints with no specific tie to the region. The lack of such a tie was not viewed as an impediment to the efficacy of the relics’ powers, since medieval clerics believed that all saints chose where their relics landed. That the apostle had chosen this specific site as the resting place of his miraculous body established a connection to his relics in Galicia; the account did not require the element of Santiago’s evangelization in order to bolster the legitimacy of the relics’ presence. Even before the apostle’s choice of Galicia for the burial of his relics was revealed, hymns had begun to honor Santiago as ‘‘our protector and patron helper.’’14 Yet it is important to keep in mind that the early medieval church lacked a bureaucratic or centralized process for naming saints or patrons; the recognition of saints derived from popular acclaim, tradition, and episcopal support. As a result, no definite date for the beginning of Santiago’s patron sainthood can be established, though we can trace the development of a bond of mutual obligation between Santiago and (future) Castilians. The mutual bond required that the apostle 12. It was Katherine van Liere who first observed the lack of interest in the apostle’s evangelization throughout the Middle Ages. Van Liere and Emma Falque Rey agree that Fletcher’s reading of the Historia as validating the legend of Santiago’s evangelization is based on a codicological error.

Although medieval historians claimed that Santiago’s military intercession for the Spanish began with Clavijo in the ninth century, stories of Santiago’s appearance at critical moments in battle against the ‘‘infidels’’ actually originated in the political and military realities of the High Middle Ages. The evolution of Santiago as warrior might not have been possible without the influence of the First Crusade (1095–1101), when crusading ideology, developed and circulated by the Franks, began to appear in Spain. During the First Crusade, crusaders and theologians disseminated a new discourse of spiritual warfare throughout the Latin West that valorized certain military endeavors.17 In addition, the crusaders’ travels to Byzantium opened them to the influence of aspects of Byzantine cultic devotion, which included an emphasis on warrior saints that theologians in the Latin West tended to discourage.18 The iconography of saints as warriors, and as intercessors for warriors, fit perfectly with the development of crusading ideology in the West. Early accounts of the Crusades, like the widely read history of Robert the Monk, often included stories of saints appearing in battles to defend Christian soldiers at crucial moments.19 15.

Both the English and Catalans eventually adopted him as their patron saint. He was depicted not only as a soldier and martyr but also as a serpent killer, an iconography that connected him visually with the archangel Michael, commander of the heavenly host, with whom he was often depicted.20 The cults of Michael and George, among others, might have provided both inspiration and a blueprint for the cult of Santiago in Spain, beginning in the early twelfth century. All three bear iconographic similarities: George and Santiago, for example, were often portrayed on white horses, trampling enemies underfoot. Most historians agree that images of Santiago as a warrior, the socalled Matamoros (Moorslayer), arose only in the twelfth century.21 The first image of Santiago as a warrior appeared in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, in a sculpture in which the apostle appears on horseback wielding a sword.22 Thus the ascendancy of Santiago as a military saint occurred only after the First Crusade and the spread of crusading rhetoric throughout western Europe. Iberia was particularly ripe for the adoption of crusading ideology, as its Christian leaders began renewing their assaults on their Islamic neighbors with increased vigor and success during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.23 Santiago Matamoros, therefore, became a polemical addition to the new language of crusade being introduced in a renewed surge of military activity by Spanish kings. But Santiago was never the exclusive patron saint of the reconquest, no matter what the Compostelan cathedral preferred to claim, largely because of the regional diversity of the emergent Christian kingdoms. The new Christian territories created by the conquest of lands from alAndalus were not unified; instead, the peninsula became a patchwork of kingdoms and principalities with evolving relationships to one another— Galicia, Asturias-Leo´n, Navarre, Arago´n, Catalonia, and Portugal. From the eleventh to the thirteenth century, the Christian territories were 20.

Many historians of medieval Spain and the Crusades have noted the Frankish influence on the Spanish kingdoms in the evolution of the concept of reconquista as a form of crusade. For one example, see Marcus Bull, Knightly Piety and the Lay Response to the First Crusade: Limousin and Gascony, c. 970–c. 1130 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), 72–114.\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$CH1\n\n12-07-10 15:17:52\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 26\n\nSantiago and the Shadow of Decline\n\n27\n\nconsolidated into larger kingdoms; for example, the twelfth century saw the emergence of the separate kingdom of Portugal, while the ancient kingdom of Asturias-Leo´n joined together with the newer kingdom of Castile and, in the east, Catalonia with Arago´n. As a result, there could be no one patron saint of reconquest. At least three major saints who were also regional patrons were regularly invoked during battle: Santiago (regional patron of Asturias-Leo´n), Milla´n (regional patron of Castile), and George (regional patron of Catalonia).24 Eventually Santiago’s cult came to dominate that of Saint Milla´n in Castile, though the two were sometimes invoked together.25 In addition to these, a small number of more minor saints, such as Isidoro and Hermenegildo, were also occasionally invoked in battle. Moreover, one of the most popular reconquista saints throughout the Iberian kingdoms remained the Virgin Mary.26 Santiago’s position as the most popular patron of warfare was thus far from inevitable. The eventual dominance of Santiago over other patrons in Castile arose from a variety of complex devotional and political factors, the most important of which was certainly the cathedral of Santiago’s power and influence. The cathedral assiduously tried to associate the cult of Santiago with the royal family of Castile-Leo´n, and it occasionally nursed dreams of pushing its Castilian ecclesiastical rival, Toledo, out of its primatial seat.27 In its bid for dominance over all other holy sites in Castile, the Compostelan cathedral came to view Santiago’s relics and military apparitions as pieces of evidence for its spiritual superiority. Unlike the legend of Santiago’s evangelization of Spain, the apostle’s presence at key battles in Spanish history underscored his closeness to God and continued protection of the Spanish people in their struggle against the infidels. It is no surprise that the cathedral of Santiago boasts the oldest known image of the saint as warrior, or that the Historia compostellana devoted much attention to military apparitions. Santiago became the primary symbol of the ideology of Castilian reconquest as crusade, and the battle cry ‘‘God and Santiago, help us!’’ 24. Ibid., 193–99. 25. Unfortunately, there is no definitive account of how the cult of Santiago assumed a place of preeminence over Milla´n and other popular warrior saints; all historians know is that this was eventually accomplished, despite Milla´n’s continued popularity.

The twelfthcentury chronicle dedicated to extolling the deeds of Alfonso VII (d. 1157) included numerous references to spiritual appeals to Santiago during times of crisis and warfare, almost exclusively in the format of invocations rather than accounts of apparitions. For example, the soldiers ‘‘cried out to the God of heaven and earth and to Saint Mary and to Saint James in prayer, that they might help and defend them.’’29 An account of a later battle depicted Muslims calling out to Mohammed and Christians to God, Mary, and Santiago.30 A more detailed prayer, which also invoked Christ and Mary, asked that Santiago, ‘‘apostle of Christ, defend us in danger, that we do not perish in dreadful Judgment at the hands of the Saracens.’’31 One of the most striking features of these invocations is that they are defensive pleas for protection rather than requests for aggressive military intervention. The soldiers appealed to Santiago (along with Mary) for help and protection, but they asked their saints to save them, not to kill their enemies; no apparitions followed such prayers, and apparently none was anticipated. Although it seems likely that stories of Santiago’s appearance in battle were already circulating around the time that this chronicle was written, it is clear that the twelfth century was a period of evolution for Santiago, from patron and protector to Matamoros. The full formation of the Matamoros ideology occurred in the thirteenth century. By this time one finds complete references to the third and crucial element of santiaguista legends: the apostle’s purported appearance at the battle of Clavijo, described as the first time Santiago intervened in battles against Muslims. Although the ninth-century battle may have been discussed in earlier centuries, especially in the twelfth, it was not until thirteenth-century histories that the battle attained a central role in stories about the reconquest.32 The archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Jime´nez de Rada (d. 1247), wrote a highly influential history of the Spanish people in which he included a description of the battle of 28. For one famous example, see The Poem of the Cid, ed. Ian Michael, trans. Rita Hamilton and Janet Perry (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1975), 68:1134–40. 29. ‘‘Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris,’’ in Chronica Hispana Saeculi XII, ed.

Unfortunately, a systematic study of the legend of Clavijo has yet to be written. Early twentieth-century Spanish historians, particularly Galician historians, attempted to find evidence for the historical battle, with mixed results and endless controversy over dating. But, to my knowledge, no one has yet traced the history of accounts of the battle in primary sources.\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$CH1\n\n12-07-10 15:17:54\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 28\n\nSantiago and the Shadow of Decline\n\n29\n\nClavijo containing all the elements of the legend as we still know it: On the night before the battle, King Ramiro had a dream in which he was comforted by Santiago and assured of victory against the Arabs. The next day, the apostle appeared in the thick of battle on a white horse, brandishing a sword.33 While all thirteenth-century versions of the battle contained the same elements (the dream, the apparition, the white horse, the seventy thousand enemies killed), they were not all consistent. For example, the Castilian Primera Cro´nica General (First general chronicle) presented a detailed account of the battle of Clavijo and Ramiro’s dream the night before, in which the apostle told Ramiro, ‘‘You know that our lord Jesus Christ separated the world into provinces for my brothers, the other apostles and me, and that he gave Spain to me alone that I might guard and defend it from the enemies of the faith.’’34 This brief account of how Santiago originally came to Spain served the function of explaining to the king (and the audience) why the apostle took a special interest in Spain. It also drew a line of continuity from his first-century preaching in Spain to crusading ideology, representing Santiago as the liberator of the Spanish from faithlessness and unbelievers. Elsewhere, the Primera Cro´nica ignored legends about Santiago’s preaching and interment in Spain; the focus remained on thirteenth-century preoccupations—the apostle and the spiritual impetus behind Christian armies’ movement southward into Islamic territory.35 By the thirteenth century, then, all three legends about Santiago in Spain had been fully formed and integrated into Castile’s political and cultural ideology, and the saint’s prestige as patron was growing. No doubt the kings of Castile-Leo´n identified Santiago’s cult as a potential source for consolidating their own authority and providing a legitimizing and motivating force to their political and economic desire to expand territorially to the south. Yet one of the most fascinating aspects of Santiago’s cult in this period is the contrast between his role as predominantly 33.

Ramo´n Mene´ndez Pidal, 2 vols. (Madrid: Editorial Gredos, 1977), 2:360. 35. The version of Clavijo from the Primera Cro´nica was actually taken from a slightly older history of Spain, Lucas de Tu´y’s world chronicle, which also included a reference to Santiago telling the king that he had evangelized Spain, though Van Liere argues that elsewhere Lucas expressed no interest in the legend of Santiago’s evangelization. See Van Liere, ‘‘Moorslayer and the Missionary,’’ 527–28. For more on Lucas and Jı´menez de Rada, see Lucy K. Pick, Conflict and Coexistence: Archbishop Rodrigo and the Muslims and Jews of Medieval Spain (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2004), 173–77.\n\n................. 17923$\n\n$CH1\n\n12-07-10 15:17:54\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 29\n\n30\n\nSaint and Nation\n\na Castilian saint and the insistence of sources that the apostle protected all Spain.36 As we have seen, the disparate kingdoms of the peninsula maintained their own preferred patrons, as well as their own languages, laws, customs, and political identities.37 While the movement of Santiago’s cult from locally important to one that gradually eclipsed other major patrons in Castile is easy to establish, it is more difficult to grasp how, when, and exactly why Castilians identified the apostle’s cult with Spain rather than with Castile alone. The key to understanding the association of Santiago with Spain emerges when we take a closer look at the legends surrounding the apostle. While devotion to the apostle in Spain was medieval (and largely Castilian), the legends about Santiago—primarily his foundation of the Christian church on the Iberian Peninsula—predate the existence of the disparate kingdoms, which emerged only during the reconquest period. Thus Santiago’s evangelization occurred when the entire region remained a Roman province. Since his presence in Iberia predated the legal-political divisions of the peninsula that occurred during the reconquest phase, his followers were able to claim a more universal jurisdiction for his patron sainthood. He was thus the patron saint of Hispania, or Spain. The ‘‘Spain’’ invoked by these Castilians drew from a rich diversity of linguistic-cultural groups; even if the Castilians assumed that they inhabited the most important region of Spain, they still used the term, knowingly and deliberately, to refer to all the Spanish kingdoms, and not merely to Castile.38 Through links between Santiago’s evangelization and his apparitions in battles against Muslims, Santiago became tied to the peninsula’s Roman and Visigothic past. Subsequent historians often described this period as a golden age that preceded the devastating invasion of Islamic forces at the beginning of the eighth century. Thus the term ‘‘Spain’’ immediately invoked this idealized period of unity and Christianity, before the darkness and chaos of 711. The rhetoric of reconquest relied on this vision of the past for its force and legitimacy—Christians had the duty to ‘‘reclaim’’ the territory that h"
