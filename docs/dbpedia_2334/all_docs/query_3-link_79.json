        "text": "HISTORY\n\nThe family of Castelbajac originated in 980, it has been guarding the rich and hearty soil of Gascony for centuries. Descendants of the first king of Navarre Eneko Arista, the lineage has birthed many illustrious figures who have tirelessly defended the land and its prosperity. Having mostly lived in the Bigorre and in Gascony/Armagnac the family has always had a long lasting love for this unique ‘Elixir'.\n\nCASTELBAJAC, Castelbayac, Castelbayard, Châtel-Bayac, Châtel-Bayard, Castrum-Boayacum and CastroBayaco, are the names, according to the different times and the various idioms, of a noble, ancient and formerly very powerful house, which it draws from the ancient barony of Castelbajac in Bigorre, and whose origin is lost in the dark times: it is an ancient tradition in this family that it comes from Enéco Arista, who was count of Bigorre and first king of Navarre, which he conquered over the Saracens around the year 829, and which, according to the testimony of the ancient Spanish historians of M. de Marca, Turquet de Mayerne and others, took as weapons of azure the cross of silver: weapons that the kings of Navarre and those of Aragon from him have always carried and preserved with care, as well as the barons of Castelbajac in Bigorre, who claim to descend from it as seen in their ancient seals and in their old castles and monu where they are engraved and painted: and indeed M. de Thou formally says in his History \"that the kings of Castile, Navarre and Aragon came from an illustrious family of Bigorre\".\n\nGeneral Castelbajac, a cavalry inspector from 1841 to 1847, was appointed Commander of the 11th Military Division on 1 October 1844 and Commander of the 11th Military Division. Retirement by decree of the Interim Government of 17 April 1848.\n\nGeneral Castelbajac, a cavalry inspector from 1841 to 1847, was appointed Commander of the 11th Military Division on 1 October 1844 and Commander of the 11th Military Division. Retirement by decree of the Interim Government of 17 April 1848.\n\nIn between the wars and explorations of many, many years ago, some of the Castelbajacs were Armagnac producers. This is why Louis-Marie de Castelbajac has cast himself out to rediscover the absolute best of the land. Through methodical research akin to that of an archeologist, he explored for 3 years with a team to find a perfect Armaganac. Not only were the results favorable, but homage to the Elixir and his ancestors has been paid, bringing this complexly generous and unique treasure into a new era, an era that celebrates its 700 years of existence."
