I won't go any faster then I walk here everyday, so it will take a while (weeks? months?). As I go I'll post here, to pick the brains of everyone who's already walked.\n\nFirst up is basic resources....\n\nIn addition to several bookmarked threads that I already have, here are my starting points as far as information goes:\n\nEnder's guide:\n\n@peregrina2000's guide from Bilbao:\n\n@caminka's guide from Pamplona:\n\nAnd of course:\n\nCamino Viejo | Camino de Santiago | Gronze.com\n\nEl Camino Olvidado a Santiago o Camino de la Montaña o Camino Viejo es una ancestral ruta jacobea que desde Pamplona y Bilbao avanza por el norte del Camino Francés hasta unirse a éste en Cacabelos.

I'm coming from Santiago, and have the choice of a bus ride more or less on the Norte, A train to Irun following parts of the Invierno, Frances, and Via de Bayona - and then somehow getting across to Pamplona - or a train to Pamplona via Madrid. (Flying is also possible, but why fly? It's not as if time is an issue!)\n\nRome2rio\n\nDiscover how to get anywhere by searching plane, train, bus, car and ferry routes\n\nI love that train journey to Irun, so am thinking that I might suck up the extra travel time and go for it.

The road of town is so straight and straightforward you’d struggle to take a wrong turn.\n\nI have Wikiloc track to follow but prefer not to have my nose constantly in my phone. So I am wondering if anybody knows the state of the waymarking between Pamplona and Salvatierra now?\n\nThere is there is a lot of information now (thanks to Ender's guide and more pilgrim traffic and blogs here) about the Olvidado from Bilbao. But there's much less information about the arm of the Viejo that joins it coming from Pamplona. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one trying to round up loose ends of information:\n\nNow this is the third time I have tried to round up the loose details of this Viejo Camino from the Pamplona start.\n\nWith some luck I will take that route some fine day.\n\nI'm tired after the long trip and the slog coming up from the train station, so I'm glad to have planned a free day tomorrow to poke around Pamplona. I look forward to revisiting the Navarre Museum, enjoying some Tapas at bar Gaucho and maybe a trip to Caminoteca. I got here late, so I had booked at a very nice little hotel that @NualaOC turned me onto after we walked the Baztan in 2017:\n\nAnyone have recommendations for things you particularly like in Pamplona?\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nApr 30, 2020\n\n#4\n\nI was just kidding with The Cookie Shop but you must visit the church of San Saturnino also nearby.

(Seriously, I was so shocked to find that I had walked the 20K+ back and forth in my corridor.)\n\nThere's lots to digest in one day.\n\nThe exit from Pamplona is easy as can be, and the camino follows a major artery much of the way. In fact much of the first part of this camino follows the 'main drag' between Pamplona and Vitoria, going through the gap in the mountains that the trains follow between Vitoria and Irun. There was a Roman Road here, too, of course - it is a natural corridor. Sadly the link that I had bookmarked that would have said more no longer works...am I the only one? It's a pity if so - this was a fantastic and fascinating resource.\n\nSo I found a blog at the last minute that is extremely useful, almost as good as a guide, because it lists places to stay and eat; here's a sample page:\n\nCamino Viejo · Camino Olvidado · Camino de las Asturias 02 Irurtzun - Alsasua 34,5 km +275 m -198 m | RocJumper\n\nLa seguna etapa de Camino Viejo vía pamplona va de Irurtzun a Alsasua es un largo aunque bonito paseo entre montañas. ¡Desfrútala!\n\n(His is the Wikiloc track I found.)\n\nThe way at first follows the autopista, but looks beautiful as it gets closer to Irurzun and Hiriberri (at least from Google Earth!). Anyone with interest in geology would love this landscape - the Basque Country is messy, complicated, and interesting! Lots of folded and crumpled rock layers to admire!\n\nBetween Irurzun and Hiriberri, there is the beautiful Romanesque Ermita Santiago de Itxasperri, which looks like a place worth some time:\n\nAnd a photo:\n\nLast edited: May 8, 2020\n\nMay 3, 2020\n\n#7\n\nGreat to have you here, Laurie! Once I get to the Olvidado proper I'll be happy to pick your brain.\n\nWell, on hold or not— that new Camino de las Asturias going from Pamplona to Oveido follows the same route for much of the first part of this way. So someone is obviously doing some promotion.\n\nI could be wrong but my understanding that the Viejo is the limb that comes from Pamplona, I would guess as far as Aguilar de Campoo.\n\nBeing somewhat cartographically challenged, is there any way to put up a map of these two routes?\n\nYou started talking about what Caminka calls the Camino Viejo, Pamplona to Aguilar de Campoo, where it joins the Camino Olvidado (whose route is Bilbao to Ponferrada).\n\nBut now you have seen info about the Camino de las Asturias from Pamplona to Oviedo. Based on the stages I see on the website you linked, that camino crosses the Camino Olvidado at Cervera de Pisuerga, which is one stage after Aguilar de Campoo. That leads me to think that the Camino de las Asturias goes a little north of the Camino Viejo, but I can't visualize it.\n\nI wasn't totally sure, but I think that when you say the Camino de las Asturias \"follows the same route\", you mean it follows the same route as the Camino Viejo for the first part?\n\nI tried to figure this out for myself, using the following data points.\n\nCamino de las Asturias lists stage one as Pamplona to Irurtzun 22 km.\n\nYou have said your first stage was Pamplona to Hiriberri 20 km\n\nBut Hiriberri, according to googlemaps, is east of Zubiri (and 68 km from Irurtzun), so I am totally confused. Or maybe you are lost. Or both.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n#8\n\nBut Hiriberri, according to googlemaps, is east of Zubiri (and 68 km from Irurtzun), so I am totally confused. Or maybe you are lost. Or both.\n\nThe latter is always a possibility! But I don't think I am: There must be two of these strangely named villages.\n\nHere's a screenshot from my OsmAnd app; the place in question is on the purple wikiloc track, on the left side. When I have a moment later I will post an overview map:\n\nI think that when you say the Camino de las Asturias \"follows the same route\", you mean it follows the same route as the Camino Viejo for the first part?\n\nYes, as far as I understand.\n\nCamino de las Asturias lists stage one as Pamplona to Irurtzun 22 km.\n\nObviously, YMMV. I'm calculating distance with the direction function on my OsmAnd app.\n\nThere is some confusion in my mind too, about this route. @caminka's guide from 2012 seems extremely up and down, whereas this Wikiloc track from rocjumper is very much flat, down in the bottom of the valley. The Camino sounds like it has been recently marked, and perhaps they just took the easiest route, avoiding the ups and downs of the GR route. There look to be many mountain alternatives, which I know would totally delight you Laurie!\n\nWhen I have a ticket to Madrid, I'll just post on the forum and ask \"where should we meet?\" and I'll show up, ready to walk.\n\nYeah, and can you imagine the delightful chaos if we all do that?\n\nLast edited: May 4, 2020\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n#9\n\nBetween Irurzun and Hiriberri, there is the beautiful Romanesque Ermita Santiago de Itxasperri, which looks like a place worth some time:\n\nCaminos Del Romanico And a photo:\n\nAnd to be sure that you want to visit here is another photograph of it.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n#10\n\nDay 2. Hiriberri to Etxarri Aranatz 19.7 Km\n\nThe recently marked way follows the Sakana Valley, with dramatic karst landscapes all around. And I am astonished by the number of Ermitas along the way - eight in this stretch alone, a veritable smorgasbord of saints:\n\nErmita Nuestra Señora de Berastegui\n\nErmita de Santa Barbara\n\nErmita de San Gregorio\n\nErmita de San Miguel\n\nErmita de San Sebastien\n\nErmita de San Pedro\n\nErmita de San Antonio\n\nErmita de San Juango\n\nNot to mention the Romanesque monastery of Zamarce which was built in the 12th C.\n\nOsmAnd tells me that in the surrounding hills, there are many many dolmens and menhir, as well. If you wanted to pause here it would be easy to wander for many kilometers on tracks up in the mountains, like the circular Route of the Dolmens, which leaves near this campground where I stopped for the night (it even has a swimming pool!):\n\nCamping in Etxarri Aranatz Navarre Basque Country Caravanning\n\nUrbasa eta Aralar parkeen artean dago, naturaz inguratuta. Etxarri kanpinean opor ahaztezinak izango dituzu. Kanpin familiarra Nafarroan. Kanping-Caravanning, Euskal Herrian.\n\nEtxarri is a good break in what could otherwise be a pretty long stage. There is not so much in the way of lodging in the towns in this valley, so if you want to do short stages it will take some planning. Again, rocjumper's blog lists accommodation options, but may not have everything. I found an albergue in Irañeta off Google Maps.\n\nIf there is a valley floor option, it puts it back on the possibilities list.\n\nThere definitely is, @Northern Light:\n\n@Sheffield James says this of his walk in 2018 about the stretch after Hiriberri:\n\n...very little of yesterday’s beautiful scenery in evidence. All the walking was done on the road, beginning with quite pleasant secondary and tertiary roads, but increasingly it involved the national road (NA 2410) which weaved alongside the Autovia. I made little effort to seek alternative routes, partly because of yesterday’s fiasco, partly due to the drabness of the day and partly because I think the great wilderness awaits me after leaving the Pamplona to Vitoria-Gesteiz transport corridor.\n\nI ended up this evening at a truck-stop at Olaza /Olazagutia, 2kms from the biggish-looking town of Altsasu-Alsasua.\n\nHere is how @caminka walked it, a very different experience - @peregrina2000, these are your 'mountain alternatives; she has links to her wikiloc tracks here, post #28:\n\npamplona - villanueva de arakil, 31km via irurtzun\n\na fairly long day on sometimes difficult former gr21 (waymarks removed). requires some orientation skills. casa rural irigoen with superb treatment, atmosphere, and food. HP for 27E. two houses with blasones with scallops in the village.\n\nvillanueva de arakil - monasterio zamartze, 8km\n\nan unplanned stay, excavations in monasterio (roman waystation and medieval graves, some with scallops), and a car visit to santuario de aralar. but monasterio zamartze doesn't usually accommodate people - perhaps that might change in the future? otherwise, I would recommend going as far as alsasua (29km).\n\nmonasterio zamartze - puerto de lizarraga, 23km\n\na majestic day almost literally straight up from huarte arakil to beriain (1000m climb in less then 6km) with a superb view all around, fog permitting, then a solitary and somewhat longish descent to puerto lizarraga. the only water in huarte arakil! hostal in puerto lizarraga 50E per room.\n\npuerto de lizarraga - alsasua, 20km\n\na walk on panoramic ridge then a descent through beautiful forest to alsasua. in albergue juvenil ring the right bell. 17E.\n\nAnd to be sure that you want to visit here is another photograph of it.\n\nJust yes.\n\nSo your Hiriberri is 2 km before Irurtzun, and both are located on both the Camino de las Asturias and the Camino Viejo? If the answer to that question is yes, I am no longer confused.\n\nWeeeellll, sort of. Close but no cigar. Hiriberri is about 6kms after Irurtzun. But yes - both are on those caminos...which, like the Vasco and the Via de Bayona, follow the same route for a ways.\n\nA nice way to avoid the crowds. Come in to Pamplona off the Aragones and off on this way.\n\nAnd finish on the Invierno. Or the Camino de las Asturias....\n\nLast edited: May 4, 2020\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n#11\n\nAnd to be sure that you want to visit here is another photograph of it.\n\nBeautiful!\n\nNow, if you have some spare time, how about some photos of each of those Ermitas?\n\nPretty please??\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 4, 2020\n\n#12\n\nis there any way to put up a map of these two routes?\n\nHere is a crummy map for you Laurie.

So if you want to go, be prepared for a climb! You can get there from Arbizu (the town before Hiriberri, and there are places to stay there if you wanted to spend a few nights to allow you to explore the nearby hills.)\n\nCave of Mendukilo : https://mendukilo.com/en/\n\nThis looks a bit commercialized but still interesting. You would probably need transport...\n\nHere is the link to a page with all sorts of walking options in the Urbasa-Andía Natural Park to the south of the valley, and the Sierra de Aralar Natural Park between the Sakana Valley and the valley of the river Oria to the Northwest, which the Vasco Interior traverses.\n\nOrganize your trip to Navarra | Visit Navarra - Official Website of the Navarre Tourist Board\n\nA week, a long weekend, a few days or are you just passing through?

My comments after each one you have listed.\n\nThere is a Navarra tourism site dedicated to the Valle Sakana, http://turismo.navarra.com/item/el-valle-de-sakana/\n\nbut it is focused on food and geography, not churches!\n\nAlso a nice tourism video, which has some shots of churches, but no identification. My guess is that they are of San Miguel de Aralar and the Zamarce monastery, because those two seem to be the standouts in the valley. http://www.sakana.eus/en/\n\nErmita Nuestra Señora de Berastegui\n\nPicture here — http://www.sebastianschutyser.com/engels/ermita-14.html\n\nand here. https://s1.kaia.es/images/2020/02/18/Z1139_106.jpg\n\nErmita de Santa Barbara\n\nNot sure if this is the right Santa Barbara ermita, but it is near Mañeru, which is on the Francés and roughly in the right vicinity. Knowing little about 19th century Spain, the web page describes the importance of this site in the Carlist Wars, so that may also be a geographical hint.\n\nhttp://senderismonavarra.blogspot.com/2017/11/Ermita-de-santa-barbara-maneru-fuerte-carlista.html\n\nErmita de San Gregorio\n\nPicture at the bottom of this website. http://www.etxarriaranatz.eus/index.asp?idi=ES&p1=edificios-religiosos\n\nErmita de San Miguel\n\nSan Miguel de Aralar.

This looks like one to visit — a romanesque ermita all alone in the valley.\n\nhttp://www.almonteparaque.com/blog/sakana-ermitas-de-berama-itxasperri-berastegi-despoblados-\n\nNot to mention the Romanesque monastery of Zamarce which was built in the 12th C.\n\nDefinitely a place to visit. http://www.zamartze.info/\n\nThe monastery website explains some of the evolving interest in the Camino that passes through this valle. http://www.zamartze.info/camino-de-santiago-2\n\nSan Donato Beriain, which you didn’t include, is at one end of the valley and seems very interesting. It is the highest ermita in Navarra and looks like a beautiful walk up. A very long video here.\n\nSo, some of the websites I’ve seen do have wikiloc tracks, but I am not sure about your ideas about walking in this valley. Based on what I saw, I think San Miguel and the monastery are the two gems. San Donato would be a spectacular ascent.\n\nSo are these places Located in Day 2’s walk or is this a detour from Day 2? And do you have your lodging options sorted out so far?\n\nAttachments\n\n1588711509285.jpeg\n\nLast edited: May 5, 2020\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nMay 5, 2020\n\n#16\n\nI am not able to figure out how to transfer fotos from the web to the forum\n\nHere is a easy way to do it (much easier on a PC than a phone).

Based on the stages I see on the website you linked, that camino crosses the Camino Olvidado at Cervera de Pisuerga, which is one stage after Aguilar de Campoo. That leads me to think that the Camino de las Asturias goes a little north of the Camino Viejo, but I can't visualize it.\n\nI wasn't totally sure, but I think that when you say the Camino de las Asturias \"follows the same route\", you mean it follows the same route as the Camino Viejo for the first part?\n\nI think that at least in the general route direction both caminos follow the same route till la puebla de arganzon, along the wide valley of the river arakil. as far as the actual walking route, they probably differ. mainly because I really don't like asphalt and make my route/description via sites that I want to see.\n\nsomewhere I think I was writing about how camino viejo could be named after ther the route that that abbot(?) gundisalvo from the 9/10C took when he accompanied some nobles from pamplona to santiago.\n\nI remember that they did go via frias.\n\nI’ve had my eye on the Viejo for a while but all the hills previously referenced had me second guessing this route. If there is a valley floor option, it puts it back on the possibilities list. So I thank you for doing all this homework!\n\nthere absolutely is a floor option. that was my primary route, but I got a wonderful chance to sleep in the monastery in zamartze, scramble around the archaeological dig, got a car ride up to the panoramic monastery of aralar (and I got the privilege to press my nose to the glass protecting the famous altar and to touch the venerated statue of st miguel).\n\nand then I decided to climb the beriain which I have been eyeing since I researched the route because it looked wonderful on the google maps from above. that was a day I absoultely wouldn't want to miss: the straight up climb into the cloud, the crawling on all fours over the top edge because the wind was so strong, losing my scallop, getting back my scallop, clouds lifting for amazing views, scenery.... oh my!\n\nLast edited: May 6, 2020\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 6, 2020\n\n#21\n\nWonderful to see you here, @caminka!

Of course the downside of that is that people tend to slavishly follow it. But here, for those who are fit there are so many other possibilities.\n\nthere were lots of local waymarked routes even before 2012 - the so-called PR routes - and quite well waymarked. also one or two GR routes (long-distance several-days long routes). I always use them if they are going in my direction.\n\nwhat I particularly like about the camino routes (and other long-distance routes) is that they connect local routes to each other in a reliable and open way. (open meaning that anyone can pass regardless of the ownership of the land the route passes through.)\n\nHmmmm...there is a story here. Do tell!\n\nI was admiring beriain from the other side of the valley, from the monastery of aralar on a sunny afternoon the day before. it was gleaming and presiding majestically above the valley. in the morning, the top was of course covered in thick cloud which was pouring down north into the valley. but I wasn't deterred. I stocked on water and slowly made my way up the (almost) vertical beech-covered slope.\n\nbelow the edge the rocky pillars were starting to peer through the clouds. when I reached the edge, the wind was blowing so strongly over it that I couldn't just walk over. I had to crawl into the cloud covering the pastures. luckily I didn't see that there is another (short) climb to the lovely romanesque san donato on top of beriain or I might have decided against going there.\n\nthe albergue portion of the ermita was open and there were even some hikers inside. while I was taking pictures I noticed that something was wrong with my backpack. at first I couldn't quite put my finger on it, then it struck me. my beloved scallop shell was gone! it has been with me since my second camino and was given to me by a dear friend. you can imagine my shock. apparently the string with which it was attached has worn down so much that the strong wind on top of beriain tore it and it fell loose. I looked all around, searched the ground around the ermita, but didn't find it.\n\nfinally I decided to move on. there was no other option because there was not going to be any water for the remainder of the day and I had a long way to go still. but I did ask all hikers I came across if they have seen a big scallop shell lying around. someone did! I was so so happy. I tucked in a pocket and resolved to get a stronger string.\n\nabout at that point the cloud miraculously disappeared and the whole of beriain became clearly seen. it's like an enormous prow of a ship, with high rocky walls on three sides and pastures on top. the rest of the day was a beautiful wander under the scorching sun across pastures with horses and past various karst formations.\n\nLast edited: May 6, 2020\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 6, 2020\n\n#23\n\nWhat a day! ☺\n\nThis means it's worth lingering for more than just a single day— one day to get up to the spectacular Hermitage on one side of the valley, and then the next day for the one on the other side of the valley. Oh wait! Make it three days— a third day to go up to the dolmens. That loop trail looks really interesting and not too intimidating.\n\nSan Donato Beriain, which you didn’t include, is at one end of the valley and seems very interesting. It is the highest ermita in Navarra and looks like a beautiful walk up. A very long video here.\n\nSo, some of the websites I’ve seen do have wikiloc tracks, but I am not sure about your ideas about walking in this valley. Based on what I saw, I think San Miguel and the monastery are the two gems. San Donato would be a spectacular ascent.\n\nIt obviously is! I didn't include it because although I had seen a photograph, I assumed it was further away — of course without checking.\n\nThis is why many Minds make wonderful planning.☺☺☺☺☺\n\nEdit: this is Beriain, which @caminka is talking about:\n\nLast edited: May 6, 2020\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 6, 2020\n\n#24\n\nThis means it's worth lingering for more than just a single day.\n\nabsolutely. monastery of zamartze is perfectly positioned for exploring if you manage to stay there. otherwise you are mostly stuck with hostales along the main road and the albergues in the two camping sites.\n\nperhaps you may convince the keepers of the monastery of aralar to let you sleep in the vast portico which is completely sheltered from the elements.\n\nand if I remember correctly, there were some open-access shelters (aka bivouacs) mentioned on the route via the dolmens to aralar.\n\nLast edited: May 7, 2020\n\nMay 6, 2020\n\n#25\n\nSorry to be lagging behind. I hope you don’t progress to Day 3 until I can get more clarity about Day 2 (and maybe an add-on — or 2?). I think the route is this one:\n\nHiriberri to Alasua is 28 km. https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/camino-de-las-asturias-hiriberri-a-alsasua-45500721 I think this day needs to be split into two to allow for detours up, one up on one side of the valley (San Miguel), the other up on the other side (San Donato).\n\nI have not included any more of the ermitas along the way, but I think we will pas some of them just by being on the camino route, and I think the main sites are San Miguel, monastery at zamartze, and San Donato/Beriain. Do you think we need to plan more detours for churches?\n\nDay 2 — Hiriberri to Zamartze monastery to San Miguel and the Dolmen circle and back down and on camino to Arruazu (total of about 22, I THINK).\n\nHiriberri to Zamartze monastery, about 6\n\nZamartze monastery up to San Miguel, and back down to Zamartze, following the dolmen circle is about 13 from the monastery. Wikilocks show the circle as 14 km, but they start from Uharte, which is at least a km away from the monastery.\n\nSAN MIGUEL ARALAR DESDE UHARTE POR DOLMENES\n\nSAN MIGUEL ARALAR DESDE UHARTE POR DOLMENES Hiking trail in Huarte-Araquil, Navarra (España). Download its GPS track and follow the itinerary on a map. En la Sierra de Aralar existe uno de los conjuntos megalíticos más interesantes de la Península Ibérica. Existen más de 40 dólmenes y un menhir...\n\nTo sleep that day, I picked a hotel rural about 3 km away along the Camino (page 9 @caminka googledoc), just for orientation purposes. The town is Arruazu and I’ve picked it because it gets us well positioned for Day 2A.\n\nCASA RURAL MARTXOENEA LANDETXEA - Lodge Reviews (Arruazu, Spain)\n\nCasa Rural Martxoenea Landetxea, Arruazu: See 5 traveler reviews, 2 candid photos, and great deals for Casa Rural Martxoenea Landetxea, ranked #1 of 1 specialty lodging in Arruazu and rated 4 of 5 at Tripadvisor.\n\nNow, the ascent to San Donato — @caminka’s story has grabbed hold of my imagination and I cannot imagine walking through that valley without going up there.\n\nDay 2A —Arruazu to Extarri-Aranatz 19 km. (via Beriain)\n\nWith a sleep in Arruazu, the climb to San Donato/Beriain is, according to google maps about 10 km. And about 500 m up. But oh the exhiliration of those views and the sensation of being on top of the world! Going back down and continuing on to Extarri-Aranatz would be 9 more km. (Page 10 @caminka google doc). CR Urmendi and a camping. Or add on the 10 km from Extarri to Alasua to make this a 29 km day and give us a shorter day into Salvatierra the next day.\n\nI saw you were talking about another Dolmen circle, this one from Extarri. That is a 15 km loop. That could be added just as a day side trip to dolmens. Or doing the second dolmen loop and then adding on the 10 km from Extarri to Alasua would give us a 25 km day from Extarri to Alasua. I can’t tell if the campground has cabins, but even if it doesn’t there is that CR Urmendi. I am just thinking out loud here. I think I would probably be satisfied with the dolmens that we would visit on the San Miguel circle, but I defer to you on that!\n\nOrganize your trip to Navarra | Visit Navarra - Official Website of the Navarre Tourist Board\n\nA week, a long weekend, a few days or are you just passing through? We've organised your trip to Navarra in advance: how long do you have?\n\nThe following comments jump ahead and show my reasoning for choosing Extarri as the end point. A night in Extarri-Aranatz would put us, for Day 3, 10 km from Alasua according to rocjumper’s camino Tracks. Then 22 more on to Salvatierra according to the Alava Camino de las Asturias website. Another option would be to go on beyond Extarri-Aranatz for some more kms on Day 2A to make Day 3 shorter, but I think having Salvatierra as an endpoint for Day 3, whether it comes after Day 2A or Day 2B, makes sense.\n\nSo, there are the options I see for the lovely valley of Sakana!

So I promised myself I wouldn't do this. But looking at the map... I can't resist. From the campsite in Etxarri, if you take that Dolmen Circle, once you get up the hill, it's completely possible to find a way across and then down to the Vasco at Beasain, where there is one of the best albergues on the planet. The whole top of that mountain is littered with megalithic sites and ermitas.\n\nOn the road it's about 25kms, and obviously popular with cyclists: there are many Wikiloc tracks to check out. I can't find any tracks for walking that distance, but there are clearly many trails that go in the same general direction, and with less distance. Here's a screenshot of one of the cycling tracks (I can't figure out how to copy the link):\n\nYou get the general picture; not to worry about the distance on the track, that's out and back rather than one way.\n\nWere you to do that, you'd get the best of both worlds: this part of the Viejo, plus the wonderful Tunel San Adrian on the Vasco. Either way you ultimately end up in Salvatierra. Yes, you have to go over that mountain twice, but if you like mountains it's a whole lot better than following the main transport corridor from Pamplona into Alava.\n\nLast edited: May 7, 2020\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n#28\n\nAy yay yay yay\n\nNow it’s time for me to go to bed, can’t wait to see what havoc you bring tomorrow.

There will be others going up there, now, no doubt! It looks astonishing.\n\nI have gotten no-where today, except down a rabbit hole of history. The Sakana Valley has a rich and old history, as shown by all the dolmens and ermitas, not to mention a main Roman Road. So I dug around for more information.\n\nHere are a few snippets that caught my attention (my emphasis in bold font):\n\nThere's a overview of the pre-Roman history of the Basque Country here:\n\nThis being a quote about all those dolmens:\n\n\"The Basque Country has multitude of megaliths, described as dolmens or mounds, sometimes confusingly. They are in any case burials of collective nature, placed in spots of great visibility, often on top of mountain ridges. The materials used are always of local origin.\"\n\nOnce the Romans came, of course, everything changed (quotes from another Wikipedia article):\n\n\"Under Pompey in the 1st century BC, the Romans founded Pompaelo (modern Pamplona/Iruñea); conquest of the area further west followed a fierce Roman campaign against the Cantabri (the Cantabrian Wars). There are archaeological remains from this period of garrisons protecting commercial routes all along the Ebro river, and along a Roman road between Asturica and Burdigala. \"\n\n\"Ab Asturica Burdigalam was a Roman road that linked the towns of Asturica Augusta (modern Astorga) in Gallaecia and Burdigala (modern Bordeaux) in Aquitania. The Antonine Itinerary mentions that it ran through Pallantia (Palencia), the pass of Vindeleia, Veleia, Pompaelo (Pamplona), Iturissa (Aurizberri) and the Summo Pyreneo (Roncevaux pass), among other places.\"\n\nHere is a link to an atlas of Roman roads, showing that this route follows the modern way through SJPP to Pamplona, and on to Vitoria up the Sakana Valley. It was the main route from what is now SW France to the interior of Hispania, and its gold mines and riches. The first part of this Camino Viejo, up the Sakana Valley, and on through Alava to Vitoria follows that route directly (zoom in with this interactive map):\n\nA Wikipedia entry says this about the road through the valley:\n\n\"In medieval times it would be largely replaced by the Way of St. James that, while coincident in some parts with the Roman road, it goes further south between Pamplona and Astorga.\"\n\nI entered this rabbit hole trying to clarify the relative importance of the route coming up from San Sebastian and through the Tunel San Adrian, but have no clarity. Some sources say that the Romans built the road coming up from Zegama, and tunel -while others say that it dates from a later time. Who knows?\n\n\"When Guipúzcoa and Álava became part of the Crown of Castile, San Adrián was the mandatory route connecting Europe and the Cantabrian Sea. There was even a castle that guarded the border to Navarra. San Adrián was the scene of many clashes and an area frequented by bandits. The citadel was abandoned when Castilla was annexed to Navarra in 1512. The stone path is popularly known as Calzada Romana (Roman Road), but it’s actually from the Middle Ages and it was the “Royal Path of Relay”.\"\n\nBut what is clear to me is that it would be worth an extra two or three days to link the Viejo with the Vasco!\n\nLooking in Wikiloc, I only find bike tracks, but I don't have the premium version...so no luck there.\n\nAnd information about all those ermitas?\n\nI found nothing, except for a link to your guide, @caminka.\n\nPeople and armies and roads come and go, religious observances come and go...and old ways still persist. I also found out that there is a wild and very old tradition of carnival in Alsasua during Lent, similar to the one in Lantz on the Camino Baztan. Walk through here in February, and you're in for something seriously different:\n\nAP PHOTOS: Devils, bandits romp at Carnival in Spanish towns\n\nAP PHOTOS: Devils, bandits romp at Carnival in small Spanish towns\n\nLast edited: May 7, 2020\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n#31\n\nthis was my latest version of the introduction to viejo camino:\n\n''Under the name Viejo Camino de la Montaña is scooped a vast number of secondary roman and medieval roads that run at the foothills of Cordillera Cantábrica, from Pamplona to Villafranca del Bierzo. The text of Historia Silensis (c1110), where there is the first mention of a pilgrim route in Spain per se, recounts that iter Sancti Iacobi has been secured from the barbarians by Navarrese king Sancho el Mayor from the Pyrenees to castrum Nazara (Nájera) so that peregrini won't have to make a detour via (the land of) Alava. Later Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (born in Puente la Reina in c1170 – 1247 Jun 10), archbishop of Toledo, in De rebus Hispaniae (V, 25) gives the route in more detail: iter Sancti Iacobi quod propter insultus Arabum per Alauam et Asturiarum deuia frequentabant, ab Anagaro per Biruescam et Amaiam immutauit, et per confinia Carrionis donec ad Legionem et Astoricam veniatur (from the course Alava – Asturias to the course Nájera – Briviesca – Amaya – border of Carrión – León – Astorga). This is thought to represent the older route, before it was given the present course by Sancho el Mayor. It is, in fact, what is now known as Viejo Camino, and it followed the course of the roman road from Bordeaux to Astorga, passing Roncesvalles – Pamplona – in Alava the valleys of Araquil and Salvatierra – near Vitoria – across Ebro N of Miranda – Briviesca.\n\nThe first possible known traveller on this route was bishop of Oporto who in the 12C travelled from Olorón via Jaca or Estella across Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya per devia montium, vallium atque marium to reach Carrión where he finally encountered publicae viae.''\n\nTo which I can now add this:\n\n''The historic significance and use of the camino has been handsomely backed up by the publication of two books by Julián González Prieto, Vexu Kamín and Pai Frolanus. The itinerary dates from 902 and in it abbot Gundisalvo from the Monastery of san Julián de Veseo in the valley of Valdecésar in the mountains of Curueño describes the journey taken by the retinue (of which he was part) of the sister of the Asturian king Alfonso III el Magno and the daughter of the Asturian king Ordoño I, doña Leodegundia, and one of her possible husbands, don García Íñiguez, king of Pamplona, or García Jiménez, lord of Navarra. Leodegundia pulcra Ordonii filia is more known as one of few female poets of Spanish literature some of whose work has been preserved. The party started in Pamplona and traversed Salvatierra, Alegría, Armentía, Trespuentes, Puentelarra, Tobalina, Frías, Oña, Sedano, Amaya, Nogales, Mave, Aguilar, Cervera, San Román de Entrepeñas, Velilla del río Carrión, Morra de Santiago (Caminayo), Morgovejo, Puente Almuhey, La Losilla, San Adrián, Boñar, La Mata (de la Riba), Valdepiélago, La Mata de Bérbula, Morquera, Valdecésar, Dotes, Correcillas, Crespas, San Feliz, Mataplana, Vegacervera, Coladilla, La Vid, Buiza, Beberino, Pola de Gordón, Santas Martas, Viñayo, río Luna, Riello, Pandorado, Urbicua, Guisatecha, Vegarienza, Fasgar, Colinas del Campo, Quintana de Fuseros(?), Losada, Virgen de la Peña, Bárcena, río Cúa, Cacabelos. A hundred years later the latin itinerary was translated into astur-leonés and a map of the route was made. However, the date of the pilgrimage is not certain, as queen Leodegundia is said to have entered monasterio de Boadilla in Samos in 882 and was there still in 912, when she wrote a poem titled Versi domna Leodegundia Regina. Perhaps Gundisalvo wrote the account when they were on the pilgrimage, but added the date when he presented it to someone, perhaps san Froilán. The narrative does suggest that it was written during the pilgrimage, not as a memoir years later. The document (902 or 1002?) is now in Oviedo? I tried to mentain the spirit of the text as much as possible, but did not follow the Spanish translation to the letter.''\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n#32\n\nI am not at all surprised that that territory is so littered with megalithic monuments. apart from being a major transport route the nature itselft is so magnificent that it must have evoked spiritual connotations.\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n#33\n\nanother look at the beriain, from the plain to the north of salvatierra. the straight gravel road evokes to me roman roads cutting straight through almost any landscape. it points straight to beriain, the last ridge on the horizon.\n\none of may favourite pics.\n\nLast edited: May 7, 2020\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n#34\n\nWere you to do that, you'd get the best of both worlds: this part of the Viejo, plus the wonderful Tunel San Adrian on the Vasco.

You must be careful with leave the normal paths (the falls are very impressives) specailly in winter. [June 26, 2005, Sunday: 2 new deaths in the mountain, Borja and Ruben R.I.P. ]\n\nIn winter it's a great experience for the magnificent views but it's a little dangerous, specially the summits of Iyurbain and Leziza. It's necessary the use of crampons and ice-axe and to have precaution with the avalanches if it has snowed recently since the slopes are important (2 victims in 2003 in route from Uharte-Arakil and 1 in the Morro).\n\nAnd Laurie, if you really want to have some fun try THIS wikiloc track!\n\nMarcha de las tres ermitas -XXX Sakanako ibilaldia\n\nMarcha de las tres ermitas -XXX Sakanako ibilaldia Hiking trail in Irurtzun, Navarra (España).

(The red pointer is on the parish church of San Juan Bautista there):\n\nIf so, sic transit gloria mundi! It says that now there are 60-some people there (as of 2002, so probably many fewer now). But once it was a place! here is part of what this wikipedia entry says:\n\nAmaya was one of the main villages of the Cantabri Celtic tribes, and played a key role in the Cantabrian wars during the Roman conquest of Hispania, and later, during the Visigothic Kingdom, as the capital of the Duchy of Cantabria. Amaya is mentioned in the Chronicle of John of Biclaro, as a town captured by the Visigothic king Liuvigild in 574.[5]\n\nIn the first stages of the Reconquista, the city was part of the repopulating efforts of the Kingdom of Asturias in the border region of Bardulia, the primitive territories of Castile. After the campaigns of Alfonso I of Asturias (739-757) against the Moors, the city lay an abandoned in the largely empty buffer zone between Moors and Christians known at the time as \"The Desert of the Duero\" and was part of the repopulation campaign carried out a century later, during the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850-866).\n\nAt that time it was an important and significant place, as a very old saying states: \"Harto era Castilla pequeño rincón, cuando Amaya era la cabeza y Fitero el mojón\" (A very small corner was Castile, when Amaya was the head and Fitero the boundary stone).\n\nAmaya seems to have been a short-lived bishopric,[which, no longer being a residential diocese, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nSo their route, even in the 10th C, is south of the present Olvidado route, right? I guess at that time only fools would be headed to the mountains if there were a flatter, more civilized alternative.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 7, 2020\n\n#36\n\nOh, boy, this thread is big fun.\n\nSo, Laurie...our posts crossed.\n\nDoes that appeal?\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nI wouldn’t get a glimpse of what you and @sabine enjoyed so much.\n\nWell, it was only really nice after Segura - before that it was very tamed. But we did not go to Idiazabal, with it's cheese...so I can't say what you'd miss there.\n\nThe nicest thing about Beasain was the food and the albergue, so going to Zegama would bypass those. But Zegama was plenty good, too.\n\nSince all of the routes I have found for this cut-over to the Vasco from Extarri are for cycling\n\nLooking at my OsmAnd map, there are plenty of off-road options at least on the way up. It may just be that people have not posted a track. Or maybe there's no-one crazy enough to walk that.\n\nIf I’m keeping count correctly, that would make a six day trek from Pamplona to Salvatierra (cutting out your Extarri dolmen circle).\n\nDay 1 Pamplona to Hiriberri\n\nDay 2 Hiriberri to Arruazu or thereabouts (ascent to San Miguel)\n\nDay 3 Arruazu to Extarri (ascent to Beriain and San Donato)\n\nDay 4 Extarri to Beasín\n\nDay 5 Beasín to Zegama\n\nDay 6 Zegama to Salvatierra\n\nYeah, that looks about right.\n\nOf course, now that I've posted it, you might want to do that insane 3 Ermitas loop instead?\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n#37\n\nI have now stepped back to try for a big picture look at this part, since we will soon be on the well-established Vasco for a few stages at least and won’t have much scouting work to do.\n\nMy sources have been mainly caminka, Sheffield James, and Rocjumper. Rocjumper’s blog from last year is pretty amazing (btw, VN, do you have a link that would send me squarely to the blog, I can only get one page at a time from a link on each one of his wikiloc tracks, if that makes any sense. I see he has tons of routes in his rocjumper site, but I can’t find a sub-forum just for this leg of the Olvidado/Viejo. I would love to be able to flip back and forth through his blog).\n\nMy take-aways —\n\n@caminka was a trailblazer — when I read her description of the abandoned trail out of Pamplona, I started to reconsider. But Rocjumper’s more recent account suggests that yes indeed we can find a marked route. There seem to have been huge improvements.\n\nSheffield James‘ account makes me lean heavily towards the option of heading back up to the Vasco, either to Beasín or Zegama (probably the latter). There is going to be a straight path into Salvatierra no matter which direction we come from, but having walked through the Túnel de San Adrián on the way there would be sweeter, IMO.\n\nAnd Caminka’s contributions on the monastery, San Miguel, and of course San Donato, just shout out that those are not to be missed.\n\nAs far as that Tres Ermitas hike goes, I think it’s above my pay grade. I did see that there are local hiking groups that do it in a day and seem to arrive unscathed, though. What I can’t figure out is where the third ermita is. I believe it’s called Trinidad, but I don’t see it. I think we have a much more enjoyable way to visit San Miguel and San Donato, and maybe Trinidad is along the way on one of those days we had sketched out, but I don’t know because I can’t find it!\n\nNow all we need is the time and opportunity to walk!\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 8, 2020\n\n#38\n\nAs far as that Tres Ermitas hike goes, I think it’s above my pay grade.\n\nWhat? Hey, Laurie, it only took them a little over 11 hours! Just imagine, if you didn't have to carry a pack you could be flying.\n\nBut more seriously, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun just to zoom around from Hermitage to Hermitage without being able to linger. San Miguel is further towards Pamplona in San Donato, so with extra time to linger one could take two days — it might be worth staying partway in between and doing one on one day and one on the other.\n\nOnce you get to once you get to Etxarri, a choice needs to be made as to whether to go directly to Salvatierra, or to go via Beasain and the tunnel.\n\nThe way across from Etxarri to Beasain is roughly 25 km. Then from Beasain to Zegama is an easy 14 or so — only about 11 if you do not go via Idiazabal. And yes Lori I think you're right it would be a much more pleasant entry into salvatierra. The other route follows the main drag for a lot the way, so it looks much less quiet. The decision as to which way to go really revolves around how much time one has. With three extra days it would be worth the detour, I think. That photo that @caminka just posted of the long straight road...it would also miss that! Which for me is only a good thing.\n\nI had a link to rocjumper's blog, and may have even mentioned it in an earlier post.

Based on where he placed them in his blog, I had assumed they were in the Ermita de Nuestra Señora de Ayala, but the several websites I have looked at do not include them, so they must not be there. The exterior does seem well-preserved and interesting, though. Any ideas about where they are? And yes, I know this means I am jumping ahead, but I didn’t want to lose the thought since you posted the picture.\n\nErmita de Nuestra Señora de Ayala – Ondare irekia / Patrimonio abierto\n\nVisita la entrada para saber más.\n\nErmita de Nuestra Señora de Ayala (Alegría-Dulantzi)\n\nUno de los templos románicos de la Llanada alavesa mejor conservados.

That would make the day from Arruazu to Etxarri to Alsasua (via San Donato) a 29 km day, with a 500 m ascent. OK for my aging body now, but not clear how long it will be till we get there.\n\nBut doing that would mean that the next day we could walk Alsasua to the tunnel, which looks to be about 17.\n\nAlsasua - Túnel San Adrian - Urbia -Larrea - Dulantzi\n\nAlsasua - Túnel San Adrian - Urbia -Larrea - Dulantzi Mountain Bike trail in La Estación, Navarra (España).

Etxarri Aranatz to Alsasua 22 Km\n\nHere is where you can play around with visiting ermitas, perhaps taking some extra full days to accomplish that. The distance to Alsasua is not very far, but walks to both San Miguel and (especially) San Donato are challenging. If it were me, I wouldn't even think of including either of these detours in a regular day's walk.\n\nDay 4. Alsasua to Salvatierra 20.8 Km\n\nIf we follow the Viejo route proper, we eventually arrive at Alsasua which is where the Rio Burunda and the Alzania Ibaia Meet. What also meet here are the main transport corridors between Vitoria and either the Atlantic coast at San Sebastian or to Pamplona. There are a number of places to stay in the town, ranging from albergues to hotels.\n\nFrom Alsasua onwards, especially after passing Ziordia, we leave the mountains and the Sakana Valley behind and enter the wide valley and plain of Alava — following it all the way to Vitoria. We leave Navarre and enter the province of Alava after Ziordia.\n\nTo summarize the various options here:\n\nIf you want a quieter walk into Salvatierra, you can ditch the highway and the railway by cutting across to the Vasco Interior. There are at least three ways of doing this, all entering Salvatierra via Vasco after the Tunel San Adrian. This involves either one or two serious climbs, but this is a stunning walk. So if you don't think you will have the opportunity to walk the Vasco, you can still experience one of its highlights:\n\n1. Etxarri-Besain (25km) Beasain-Zegama (12 or 14km), Zegama-Salvatierra (~20km)\n\nBeasain - Zegama - Altsasu(-koak aske!) - Etxarri - Beasain\n\nBeasain - Zegama - Altsasu(-koak aske!) - Etxarri - Beasain Road Bike trail in Igartza, País Vasco (España).

There's a very nice albergue here: get the keys at the polideportivo. Look for the strange glass kiosk-like building on way out town, and take the stairs or lift to the basement where someone will help. And there's a nice bar at the main plaza.\n\nIt turns out the Alava Plain area has many interesting Romanesque churches - and you could easily spend time going off-piste between Salvatierra and Vitoria, exploring them...this is for the next stage...\n\nROMÁNICO DE ÁLAVA III: LA LLANADA Y SALVATIERRA\n\nIglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, del Siglo XIII, en Alaiza frescos del abside.

I know you have seen that webpage, but I wasn’t sure you had seen this section of it. There is also a part involving those QR codes, which I don’t really understand, but you can see everything easily online.\n\nIsabel also told me that, yes indeed, the Estibaliz church is open from 8 am to 8 pm every single day. I am not at all sure how I missed that information last year when I walked without taking the detour. I assume I was using the schedule for the adjacent interpretation center and the guided tours, which has very limited hours. So that means that a detour from Salvatierra or even Alegría would be easy to factor in. Hooray!

Collapsed bridges and all that, if I am remembering correctly.\n\nOnce again, Pancorbo is left for another time.\n\nNot so fast there, pardner.\n\nThis is really jumping ahead, but I can't resist throwing another rock into your pond. It's only 34 km from Pancorbo to Oña. That's a day's walk for the likes of you, Laurie. From there you could rejoin @caminka's track either the way James did to Quintana de Valdevielso, or walk his route backwards to Trespanderne.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\n#55\n\nNot so fast there, pardner.\n\n@VNwalking, what app did you use to generate the graphics above?\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\n#56\n\n@VNwalking, what app did you use to generate the graphics above?\n\nIt's a screenshot of the OsmAnd app on my android phone.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nUs:Camino Frances, 2015 Me:Catalan/Aragonese, 2019\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\n#57\n\nIt's a screenshot of the OsmAnd app on my android phone.\n\nThank you.

So lumping two days into one post.\n\nDay 6 Vitoria - Puebla de Arlanzon 17.9\n\nDay 6A Alegria or Argomaniz - Puebla de Arlanzon (32.7 or 31.3, respectively)\n\nBefore Laurie and I jump ahead, first we have to get to Miranda de Ebro. There are two options for these days, depending on whether you spent the night in Alegria/Argomaniz or Vitoria (5 or 5A from the post above) and are willing to pass through Vitoria as opposed to staying the night there. It is a city worth staying in and exploring if you have not been there before or have the time to linger. The Old City, with its beautiful cathedral and wonderful restaurants make lingering a pleasure. There is also a Decathlon if you need any equipment support. If you intend to stay, there are many options including an albergue.\n\nEither way this first day gets us to Puebla de Arlanzon, where there is a good albergue and a bar and a restaurant on the other side of the railroad tracks were you can get a decent menu del dia - and a super place for breakfast on the way out of town.\n\nDay 7. Puebla de Arlanzon - Miranda de Ebro 17.5\n\nThe main thing to pay attention to on this day is to make sure you take the correct Camino, in the direction of Miranda de Ebro, rather than heading in the direction of Haro and Santo Domingo de la Calzada. After Estavillo, do not turn left but follow the general direction you've been going, downhill and under the autovia towards Armiñon.\n\nArmiñon has a lovely Bridge and seems that it should be a promising place for coffee but that may well be an empty promise. After you cross the bridge, you find yourself again on the route of the Roman road headed soon to Miranda de Ebro.\n\nMiranda de Ebro is easy to underestimate. But there is actually a lot here worth exploring. Besides the old city on the other side of the river with its Castle, and the nearby Romanesque Eglisia del Spiritu Santo, there is one of the nicest restautrants on the Via de Bayona, a place called Tartan. Edited to add — Restaurant closed permanently in 2024. It's also a good place to restock your supply of snacks.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Jun 15, 2024\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 15, 2020\n\n#60\n\nsorry to be laging behind a bit, I am still on limited internet time. (but I am reading all posts! )\n\n@caminka\n\nAnd your photo shows that ship's prow even from very far away. That long straight road...it wouldn't be much fun on a hot summer afternoon.\n\nthat straight road was not not that drastically long. I went this way because before that I wanted to see one of the best dolmens in the region - Dolmen de Aizkomendi. I think it was totally worth it. you can check its (unfavorable) location on my wikiloc track.\n\nSo that church is in Alaiza, which is a few km outside of Salvatierra.\n\nthe regime for visiting in 2012 was like this: you hired a guide and had to have your own transport. you met the guide at the church in gozeo at 10h to see the beautiful frescoes inside (camino passes by but it's locked), then you met the guide at alaiza at 14h to see those primitive frescoes inside the church. there are pilgrims on these fresceos, too. that was the reason I didn't went to see the frescoes (and I still regret it). hopefully this has changed since then.\n\nthere is another fine dolmen in the vicinity of alaiza, Dolmen de Sorginetxe. I think you met the guide there also.\n\nLast edited: May 15, 2020\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 15, 2020\n\n#61\n\nI quite like the idea of crossing the aralar mountains and incorporating tunel de san adrian into the viejo.\n\ncaminka\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsee signature\n\nMay 15, 2020\n\n#62\n\nI think that the tracing of camino de san adrian into miranda on the eastern side passes by a dolmen and a medieval castle.\n\nLast edited: May 15, 2020\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nMay 15, 2020\n\n#63\n\nI wanted to see one of the best dolmens in the region - Dolmen de Aizkomendi.
