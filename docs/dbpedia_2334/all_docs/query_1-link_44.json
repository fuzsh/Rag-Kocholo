        "text": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as meloxicam, are the mainstay for treating painful and inflammatory conditions in animals and humans; however, the repeated administration of NSAIDs can cause adverse effects, limiting the long-term administration of these drugs to some patients. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of repeated meloxicam administration on the feline plasma and urine lipidome. Cats (n = 12) were treated subcutaneously with either saline solution or 0.3 mg/kg body weight of meloxicam daily for up to 31 days. Plasma and urine lipidome were determined by LC-MS before the first treatment and at 4, 9 and 13 and 17 days after the first administration of meloxicam. The repeated administration of meloxicam altered the feline plasma and urine lipidome as demonstrated by multivariate statistical analysis. The intensities of 94 out of 195 plasma lipids were altered by the repeated administration of meloxicam to cats (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermo...\n\nThe quality of life for dogs with osteoarthritis can often be improved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); however, the number of adverse drug events associated with NSAID use reported to the Federal Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine is higher than that for any other companion animal drug. Of those events, adverse renal reactions are the second most reported. NSAIDs produce pharmacologic effects via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which decreases production of prostanoids. Prostaglandins are synthesized by both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the healthy kidney and influence renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, renin release, and Na excretion. There are important species differences in the renal expression of COX-1 and COX-2. For example, dogs have higher basal levels of COX-2 expression in the kidney compared with humans. In addition, in dogs with chronic kidney disease, an increase in COX-2 expression occurs and synthesis of prostaglandins shifts to the COX-2 pathway. For those reasons, NSAIDs that target COX-2 may be expected to adversely affect renal function in dogs, especially dogs with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the literature to report the renal effects of NSAIDs in dogs. (J Am\n\nObjective—To develop and validate in cats suitable in vitro assays for screening and ranking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the basis of their inhibitory potencies for cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. Animals—10 cats. Procedure—COX-1 and COX-2 activities in heparinized whole blood samples were induced with calcium ionophore and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. For the COX-2 assay, blood was pretreated with aspirin. The COX-1 and COX-2 assays were standardized, such that time courses of incubation with the test compounds and conditions of COX expression were as similar as possible in the 2 assays. Inhibition of thromboxane B2 production, measured by use of a radioimmunoassay, was taken as a marker of COX-1 and COX-2 activities. These assays were used to test 10 to 12 concentrations of a COX-1 selective drug (SC-560) and of 2 NSAIDs currently used in feline practice, meloxicam and carprofen. Selectivities of these drugs were compared by use of classic 50% and 80% in..."
