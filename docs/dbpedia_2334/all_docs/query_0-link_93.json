to: 1. Describe the development and purpose of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the National Formulary (NF) 2. Describe the central features of a typical drug monograph 3. Compare and contrast significant drug regulation and control federal laws and their impact on pharmacy 4. Explain the concept of pharmaceutical care 5. Summarize the Code of Ethics for Pharmacists of the American Pharmacists Association 6. Summarize the Code of Ethics of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS)\n\nA drug is defined as an agent intended for use in the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, cure, or prevention of disease in humans or in other animals (Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 1938). One of the most astounding qualities of drugs is the diversity of their actions and effects on the body. This quality enables their selective use in the treatment of a range of common and rare conditions involving virtually every body organ, tissue, and cell. Some drugs selectively stimulate the cardiac muscle, the central nervous system, or the gastrointestinal tract, whereas other drugs have the opposite effect. Mydriatic drugs dilate the pupil of the eye, and miotics constrict or diminish pupillary size. Drugs can render blood more coagulable or less coagulable; they can increase the hemoglobin content of the erythrocytes, reduce serum cholesterol, or expand blood volume. Drugs termed emetics induce vomiting, whereas antiemetic drugs prevent vomiting. Diuretic drugs increase the flow of urine; expectorant drugs increase respiratory tract fluid; and cathartics or laxatives evacuate\n\nthe bowel. Other drugs decrease the flow of urine, diminish body secretions, or induce constipation. Drugs may be used to reduce pain, fever, thyroid activity, rhinitis, insomnia, gastric acidity, motion sickness, blood pressure, and mental depression. Other drugs can elevate mood, blood pressure, or activity of the endocrine glands. Drugs can combat infectious disease, destroy intestinal worms, or act as antidotes against the poisoning effects of other drugs. Drugs can assist in smoking cessation or alcohol withdrawal or can modify obsessive–compulsive disorders. Drugs are used to treat common infections, AIDS, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, glaucoma, Alzheimer disease, and male impotence. They can protect against the rejection of transplanted tissues and organs and reduce the incidence of measles and mumps. Antineoplastic drugs provide one means of attacking the cancerous process; radioactive pharmaceuticals provide another. Drugs may be used to diagnose diabetes, liver malfunction,\n\n2\n\n0002035880.INDD 2\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:25 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\ntuberculosis, or pregnancy. They can replenish a body deficient in antibodies, vitamins, hormones, electrolytes, protein, enzymes, or blood. Drugs can prevent pregnancy, assist fertility, and sustain life itself. Certainly, the vast array of effective medicinal agents available today is one of our greatest scientific accomplishments. It is difficult to conceive our civilization devoid of these remarkable and beneficial agents. Through their use, many of the diseases that have plagued humans throughout history, such as smallpox and poliomyelitis, are now virtually extinct. Illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and mental depression are effectively controlled with modern drugs. Today's surgical procedures would be virtually impossible without the benefit of anesthetics, analgesics, antibiotics, blood transfusions, and intravenous fluids. New drugs may be derived from plant or animal sources, as by-products of microbial growth, or through chemical synthesis, molecular modification, or biotechnology. Computer libraries and data banks of chemical compounds and sophisticated methods of screening for potential biologic activity assist drug discovery. The process of drug discovery and development is complex. It entails the collective contributions of many scientific specialists, including organic, physical, and analytical chemists; biochemists; molecular biologists; bacteriologists; physiologists; pharmacologists; toxicologists; hematolo­ gists; immunologists; ­ endocrinologists; pathologists; biostatisticians; pharmaceutical scientists; clinical pharmacists; physicians; and many others. After a potential new drug substance is discovered and undergoes definitive chemical and physical characterization, a great deal of biologic information must be gathered. The basic pharmacology, or the nature and mechanism of action of the drug on the biologic system, must be determined including toxicologic features. The drug's site and rate of absorption, its pattern of distribution and concentration within the body, its duration of action, and the method and rate of its elimination or excretion must be studied.\n\n0002035880.INDD 3\n\n3\n\nInformation on the drug's metabolic degradation and the activity of any of its metabolites must be obtained. A comprehensive study of the short-term and long-term effects of the drug on various body cells, tissues, and organs must be made. Highly specific information, such as the effect of the drug on the fetus of a pregnant animal or its ability to pass to a nursing baby through the breast milk of its mother, may be obtained. Many a promising new drug has been abandoned because of its potential to cause excessive or hazardous adverse effects. The most effective routes of administration (e.g., oral, rectal, parenteral, topical) must be determined, and guidelines for the dosages recommended for persons of varying ages (e.g., neonates, children, adults, the elderly), weights, and states of illness have to be established. It has been said that the only difference between a drug and a poison is the dose. To facilitate administration of the drug by the selected routes, appropriate dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, injections, suppositories, ointments, aerosols, and others, are formulated and prepared. Each of these dosage units is designed to contain a specified quantity of medication for ease and accuracy of dosage administration. These dosage forms are highly sophisticated delivery systems. Their design, development, production, and use are the product of application of the pharmaceutical sciences—the blending of the basic, applied, and clinical sciences with pharmaceutical technology. Each particular pharmaceutical product is a formulation unique unto itself. In addition to the active therapeutic ingredients, a pharmaceutical formulation contains a number of nontherapeutic or pharmaceutical ingredients. It is through their use that a formulation achieves its unique composition and characteristic physical appearance. Pharmaceutical ingredients include such materials as fillers, thickeners, solvents, suspending agents, tablet coatings and disintegrants, penetration enhancers, stabilizing agents, antimicrobial preservatives, flavors, colorants, and sweeteners. To ensure the stability of a drug in a formulation and the continued effectiveness of\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:55 PM\n\n4\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nthe drug product throughout its usual shelf life, the principles of chemistry, physical pharmacy, microbiology, and pharmaceutical technology must be applied. The formulation must be such that all components are physically and chemically compatible, including the active therapeutic agents, the pharmaceutical ingredients, and the packaging materials. The formulation must be preserved against decomposition due to chemical degradation and protected from microbial contamination and the destructive influences of excessive heat, light, and moisture. The therapeutic ingredients must be released from the dosage form in the proper quantity and in such a manner that the onset and duration of the drug's action are that which are desired. The pharmaceutical product must lend itself to efficient administration and must possess attractive features of flavor, odor, color, and texture that enhance acceptance by the patient. Finally, the product must be effectively packaged and clearly and completely labeled according to legal regulations. Once prepared, the pharmaceutical product must be properly administered if the patient is to receive maximum benefit. The medication must be taken in sufficient quantity, at specified intervals, and for an indicated duration to achieve the desired therapeutic outcomes. The effectiveness of the medication in achieving the prescriber's objectives should be reevaluated at regular intervals and necessary adjustments made in the dosage, regimen, schedule, or form, or indeed, in the choice of the drug administered. Patients' expressions of disappointment in the rate of progress or complaints of side effects to the prescribed drug should be evaluated and decisions made as to the continuance, adjustment, or major change in drug therapy. Before initially taking a medication, a patient should be advised of any expected side effects and of foods, beverages, and/or other drugs that may interfere with the effectiveness of the medication. Through professional interaction and communication with other health professionals, the pharmacist can contribute greatly to patient care. An intimate knowledge of drug\n\n0002035880.INDD 4\n\nactions, pharmacotherapeutics, formulation and dosage form design, available pharmaceutical products, and drug information sources makes the pharmacist a vital member of the health care team. The pharmacist is entrusted with the legal responsibility for the procurement, storage, control, and distribution of effective pharmaceutical products and for the compounding and filling of prescription orders. Drawing on extensive training and knowledge, the pharmacist serves the patient as an advisor on drugs and encourages their safe and proper use through patient counseling. The pharmacist delivers pharmaceutical services in a variety of community and institutional health care environments and effectively uses medication records, patient monitoring, and assessment techniques in safeguarding the public health. To appreciate the progress that has been made in drug discovery and development and to provide background for the study of modern drugs and pharmaceutical dosage forms, it is important to examine pharmacy's heritage.\n\nThe Heritage Of Pharmacy Drugs, in the form of vegetation and minerals, have existed as long as humans. Human disease and the instinct to survive have led to their discovery through the ages. The use of drugs, crude though they may have been, undoubtedly began long before recorded history, for the instinct of primitive man to relieve the pain of a wound by bathing it in cool water or by soothing it with a fresh leaf or protecting it with mud is within the realm of belief. From experience, early humans would learn that certain therapy was more effective than others, and from these beginnings came the practice of drug therapy. Among many early races, disease was believed to be caused by the entrance of demons or evil spirits into the body. The treatment naturally involved ridding the body of the supernatural intruders. From the earliest records, the primary methods of removing spirits were through the use of spiritual incantations, the application of\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:55 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nnoisome materials, and the administration of specific herbs or plant materials.\n\nThe First Apothecary Before the days of the priestcraft, the wise man or woman of the tribe, whose knowledge of the healing qualities of plants had been gathered through experience or handed down by word of mouth, was called upon to attend to the sick or wounded and prepare the remedy. It was in the preparation of the medicinal materials that the art of the apothecary originated. The art of the apothecary has always been associated with the mysterious, and its practitioners were believed to have connection with the world of spirits and thus performed as intermediaries between the seen and the unseen. The belief that a drug had magical associations meant that its action, for good or for evil, did not depend upon its natural qualities alone. The compassion of a god, the observance of ceremonies, the absence of evil spirits, and the healing intent of the dispenser were individually and collectively needed to make the drug therapeutically effective. Because of this, the tribal apothecary was one to be feared, respected, trusted, sometimes mistrusted, worshipped, and revered, for it was through his potions that spiritual contact was made, and upon that contact the cures or failures depended. Throughout history, the knowledge of drugs and their application to disease has always meant power. In the Homeric epics, the term pharmakon (Gr.), from which our word pharmacy was derived, connotes a charm or a drug that can be used for good or for evil. Many of the tribal apothecary's failures were doubtless due to impotent or inappropriate medicines, underdosage, overdosage, and even poisoning. Successes may be attributed to experience, mere coincidence of appropriate drug selection, natural healing, inconsequential effect of the drug, or placebo effects, that is, successful treatment due to psychologic rather than therapeutic effects. Even today, placebo therapy with inert or inconsequential chemicals is used successfully to treat individual\n\n0002035880.INDD 5\n\n5\n\npatients and is a routine practice in the clinical evaluation of new drugs, in which subjects' responses to the effects of the actual drug and the placebo are compared and evaluated. As time passed, the art of the apothecary combined with priestly functions, and among the early civilizations, the priest–physician became the healer of the body as well as of the soul. Pharmacy and medicine are indistinguishable in their early history because their practice was the combined function of the tribal religious leaders.\n\nEarly Drugs Because of the patience and intellect of the archaeologist, the types and specific drugs used in the early history of drug therapy are not as indefinable as one might suspect. Numerous ancient tablets, scrolls, and other relics as early as 3000 bc have been uncovered and deciphered by archaeologic scholars to the gratitude of historians of both medicine and pharmacy (Fig. 1.1). Perhaps the most famous of these surviving artifacts is the Ebers papyrus, a continuous scroll some 60 feet long and a foot wide dating to the 16th century bc. This document, which is now preserved at the University of Leipzig, is named for the noted German Egyptologist Georg Ebers, who discovered it in the tomb of a mummy and partly translated it during the last half of the 19th century. Since that time, many scholars have participated in the translation of the document's challenging hieroglyphics, and although they are not unanimous in their interpretations, there is little doubt that by 1550 bc, the Egyptians were using some drugs and dosage forms that are still used today. The text of the Ebers papyrus is dominated by drug formulas, with more than 800 formulas or prescriptions being described and more than 700 drugs mentioned. The drugs are chiefly botanical, although mineral and animal drugs are also noted. Such botanical substances as acacia, castor bean (from which we express castor oil), and fennel are mentioned along with\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:55 PM\n\n6\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nIntroduction of the Scientific Viewpoint\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Sumerian clay tablet from the third millennium bc on which are believed to be the world's oldest written prescriptions. Among them are a preparation of the seed of carpenter plant, gum resin of markhazi, and thyme, all pulverized and dissolved in beer, and a combination of powdered roots of “Moon plant” and white pear tree, also dissolved in beer. (Courtesy of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania.)\n\napparent references to such minerals as iron oxide, sodium ­carbonate, sodium chloride, and sulfur. Animal excrements were also used in drug therapy. The vehicles of the day were beer, wine, milk, and honey. Many of the pharmaceutical formulas employed two dozen or more medicinal agents, a type of preparation later called polypharmacy. The Egyptians commonly used mortars and pestles, hand mills, sieves, and balances in their compounding of suppositories, gargles, pills, inhalations, troches, lotions, ointments, plasters, and enemas.\n\n0002035880.INDD 6\n\nThroughout history, many individuals have contributed to the advancement of the health sciences. Notable among those whose genius and creativeness had a revolutionary influence on the development of pharmacy and medicine were Hippocrates (ca. 460–377 bc), Dioscorides (first century ad), Galen (ca. 130–200 ad), and Paracelsus (1493–1541 ad). Hippocrates, a Greek physician, is credited with the introduction of scientific phar­macy and medicine. He rationalized medicine, systematized medical knowledge, and put the practice of medicine on a high ethical plane. His thinking on the ethics and science of medicine dominated the medical writings of his and successive generations, and his concepts and precepts are embodied in the renowned Hippocratic oath of ethical behavior for the healing professions. His works included the descriptions of hundreds of drugs, and it was during this period that the term pharmakon came to mean a purifying remedy for good only, transcending the previous connotation of a charm or drug for good or for evil purposes. Because of his pioneering work in medical science and his inspirational teachings and advanced philosophies that have become a part of modern medicine, Hippocrates is honored by being called the Father of Medicine. Dioscorides, a Greek physician and botanist, was the first to deal with botany as an applied science of pharmacy. His work, De Materia Medica, is considered a milestone in the development of pharmaceutical botany and in the study of naturally occurring medicinal materials. This area of study is today known as natural products chemistry and/ or pharmacognosy, a term formed from two Greek words, pharmakon, drug, and gnosis, knowledge. Some of the drugs Dioscorides described, including opium, ergot, and hyoscyamus, continue to have use in medicine. His descriptions of the art of identifying and collecting natural drug products, the methods of their proper storage, and the means of detecting adulterants or contaminants were the standards of the period, established the\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:56 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nneed for additional work, and set guidelines for future investigators. Claudius Galen, a Greek pharmacist– physician who attained Roman citizenship, aimed to create a perfect system of physiology, pathology, and treatment. Galen formulated doctrines that were followed for 1,500 years. He was one of the most prolific authors of his or any other era, having been credited with 500 treatises on medicine and some 250 others on philosophy, law, and grammar. His medical writings include descriptions of numerous drugs of natural origin with a profusion of drug formulas and methods of compounding. He originated so many preparations of vegetable drugs by mixing or melting the individual ingredients that the field of pharmaceutical preparations was once commonly referred to as “Galenic pharmacy.” Perhaps the most famous of his formulas is one for a cold cream, called Galen's Cerate, which has similarities to some in use today, including theatrical cold cream and others that are slight modifications of his formula. Pharmacy remained a function of medicine until the increasing variety of drugs and the growing complexity of compounding demanded specialists who could devote full attention to the art. Pharmacy was officially separated from medicine for the first time in 1240 ad, when a decree of Emperor Frederick II of Germany regulated the practice of pharmacy within the part of his kingdom called the Two Sicilies. His edict separating the two professions acknowledged that pharmacy required special knowledge, skill, initiative, and responsibility if adequate care to the medical needs of the people was to be guaranteed. Pharmacists were obligated by oath to prepare reliable drugs of uniform quality according to their art. Any exploitation of the patient through business relations between the pharmacist and the physician was strictly forbidden. Between that time and the evolution of chemistry as an exact science, pharmacy and chemistry became united as pharmacy and medicine had been. Perhaps no person in history exercised such a revolutionary influence on pharmacy and medicine as did Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), a\n\n0002035880.INDD 7\n\n7\n\nSwiss physician and chemist who called himself Paracelsus. He influenced the transformation of pharmacy from a profession based primarily on botanical science to one based on chemical science. Some of his chemical observations were astounding for his time and for their anticipation of later discoveries. He believed it was possible to prepare a specific medicinal agent to combat each specific disease and introduced a host of chemical substances to internal therapy.\n\nEarly Research As the knowledge of the basic sciences increased, so did their application to pharmacy. The opportunity was presented for the investigation of medicinal materials on a firm scientific basis, and the challenge was accepted by numerous pharmacists who conducted their research in the back rooms and basements of their pharmacies. Noteworthy among them was the Swede Karl Wilhelm Scheele (1742–1786), perhaps the most famous of all pharmacists because of his scientific genius and dramatic discoveries. Among his discoveries were the chemicals lactic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, and arsenic acid. He identified glycerin, invented new methods of preparing calomel and benzoic acid, and discovered oxygen a year before Priestley. The isolation of morphine from opium by the German pharmacist Friedrich Sertürner (1783–1841) in 1805 prompted a series of isolations of other active materials from medicinal plants by a score of French pharmacists. Joseph Caventou (1795–1877) and Joseph Pelletier (1788–1842) combined their talents and isolated quinine and cinchonine from cinchona and strychnine and brucine from nux vomica. Pelletier together with Pierre Robiquet (1780–1840) isolated caffeine, and Robiquet independently separated codeine from opium. Methodically, one chemical after another was isolated from plant drugs and identified as an agent responsible for the plants' medicinal activity. Today we are still engaged in this fascinating activity as we probe nature for more useful and more specific therapeutic agents. Contemporary\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:56 PM\n\n8\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nexamples of drugs isolated from a natural source include paclitaxel (Taxol), an agent with antitumor activity derived from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus baccata) and employed in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary; vincaleukoblastine, another antineoplastic drug, from Vinca rosea; and digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, from Digitalis lanata. Throughout Europe during the late 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, pharmacists like Pelletier and Sertürner were held in great esteem because of their intellect and technical abilities. They applied the art and the science of pharmacy to the preparation of drug products with the highest standards of purity, uniformity, and efficacy possible at that time. The extraction and isolation of active constituents from crude (unprocessed) botanical drugs led to the development of dosage forms of uniform strength containing singly effective therapeutic agents of natural origin. Many pharmacists of the period began to manufacture quality pharmaceutical products on a small but steadily increasing scale to meet the growing needs of their communities. Some of today's largest pharmaceutical research and manufacturing companies developed from these progressive prescription laboratories of two centuries ago. Although many of the drugs indigenous to America and first used by the American Indians were adopted by the settlers, most drugs needed in this country before the 19th century were imported from Europe, either as the raw materials or as finished products. With the Revolutionary War, however, it became more difficult to import drugs, and the American pharmacist was stimulated to acquire the scientific and technologic expertise of his European contemporary. From this period until the Civil War, pharmaceutical manufacture was in its infancy in this country. A few of the pharmaceutical firms established during the early 1800s are still in operation. In 1821, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy was established as the nation's first school of pharmacy. In 1820, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) was created to aid in establishing standards for drugs in the United States.\n\n0002035880.INDD 8\n\nDrug Standards As the scientific basis for drugs and drug products developed, so did the need for uniform standards to ensure quality. This need led to the development and publication of monographs and reference books containing such standards to be used by those involved in the production of drugs and pharmaceutical products. Organized sets of monographs or books of these standards are called pharmacopeias or formularies.\n\nThe United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary The term pharmacopeia comes from the Greek pharmakon, meaning drug, and poiein, meaning make, and the combination indicates any recipe or formula or other standards required to make or prepare a drug. The term was first used in 1580 in connection with a local book of drug standards in Bergamo, Italy. From that time on, countless city, state, and national pharmacopeias were published by various European pharmaceutical societies. As time passed, the value of a uniform set of national drug standards became apparent. In Great Britain, for example, three city pharmacopeias—the London, the Edinburgh, and the Dublin—were official until 1864, when they were replaced by the British Pharmacopoeia (BP). In the United States, drug standards were first provided on a national basis in 1820, when the first USP was published. However, the need for drug standards was recognized in this country long before the first USP was published. For convenience and because of their familiarity with them, colonial physicians and apothecaries used the pharmacopeias and other references of their various homelands. The first American pharmacopeia was the so-called Lititz Pharmacopeia, published in 1778 at Lititz, Pennsylvania, for use by the Military Hospital of the United States Army. It was a 32-page booklet containing information on 84 internal and 16 external drugs and preparations. During the last decade of the 18th century, several attempts were made by various\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:56 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nlocal medical societies to collate drug information, set appropriate standards, and prepare an extensive American pharmacopeia of the drugs in use at that time. In 1808, the Massachusetts Medical Society published a 272-page pharmacopeia containing information or monographs on 536 drugs and pharmaceutical preparations. Included were monographs on many drugs indigenous to America, which were not described in the European pharmacopeias of the day. On January 6, 1817, Lyman Spalding, a physician from New York City, submitted a plan to the Medical Society of the County of New York for the creation of a national pharmacopeia. Spalding's efforts were later to result in his being recognized as the Father of the United States Pharmacopeia. He proposed dividing the United States as then known into four geographic districts— northern, middle, southern, and western. The plan provided for a convention in each of these districts, to be composed of delegates from all medical societies and medical schools within them. Where there was as yet no incorporated medical society or medical school, voluntary associations of physicians and surgeons were invited to assist in the undertaking. Each district's convention was to draft a pharmacopeia and appoint delegates to a general convention to be held later in Washington, DC. At the general convention, the four district pharmacopeias were to be compiled into a single national pharmacopeia. Draft pharmacopeias were submitted to the convention by only the northern and middle districts. These were reviewed, consolidated, and adopted by the first United States Pharmacopeial Convention assembled in Washington, DC, on January 1, 1820 (Fig. 1.2). The first USP was published on December 15, 1820, in English and Latin, then the international language of medicine, to render the book more intelligible to physicians and pharmacists of any nationality. Within its 272 pages were listed 217 drugs considered worthy of recognition; many of them were taken from the Massachusetts Pharmacopeia, which is considered by some to be the precursor to\n\n0002035880.INDD 9\n\n9\n\nFIGURE 1.2 The first United States Pharmacopeial Convention, held on January 1, 1820 in Washington, DC. (Reprinted with permission from the United States Pharmacopeial Convention.)\n\nthe USP. The objective of the first USP was stated in its preface and remains important. It reads in part It is the object of a Pharmacopeia to select from among substances which possess medicinal power, those, the utility of which is most fully established and best understood; and to form from them preparations and compositions, in which their powers may be exerted to the greatest advantage. It should likewise distinguish those articles by convenient and definite names, such as may prevent trouble or uncertainty in the intercourse of physicians and apothecaries (1).\n\nBefore adjourning, the convention ad­opted a constitution and bylaws, with provisions for subsequent meetings of the convention leading to a revised USP every 10 years. As many new drugs entered use, the need for more frequent issuance of standards became increasingly apparent. In 1900, the Pharmacopeial Convention granted authority to issue supplements to the USP whenever necessary to maintain satisfactory standards. At the 1940 meeting of the convention, it was decided to revise the USP every 5 years while maintaining the use of periodic supplements. The first United States Pharmacopeial Convention was composed exclusively of physicians. In 1830 and again in 1840, prominent pharmacists were invited to assist in the revision, and in recognition of their contributions pharmacists were awarded full membership in the convention of 1850 and have\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:57 PM\n\n10\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nparticipated regularly ever since. By 1870, the USP was so nearly in the hands of pharmacists that vigorous efforts were required to revive interest in it among physicians. The present constitution and bylaws of the United States Pharmacopeial Convention provide for accredited delegates representing educational institutions, professional and scientific organizations, divisions of governmental bodies, non–United States international organizations and pharmacopeial bodies, persons who possess special scientific competence or knowledge of emerging technologies, and public members (2). Of the eight elected members of the board of trustees, at least two must be representatives of the medical sciences, two others must be representatives of the pharmaceutical sciences, one must be a public member, and three shall serve without restriction concerning their affiliation. After the appearance of the first USP, the art and science of both pharmacy and medicine changed remarkably. Before 1820, drugs to treat disease had been the same for centuries. The USP of 1820 reflected the fact that the apothecary of that day was competent at collecting and identifying botanical drugs and preparing from them the mixtures and preparations required by the physician. The individual pharmacist seemed fulfilled as he applied his total art to the creation of elegant pharmaceutical preparations from crude botanical materials. It was a time that would never be seen again because of the impending upsurge in technologic capabilities and the steady development of the basic sciences, particularly synthetic organic chemistry. The second half of the 19th century brought great and far-reaching changes. The industrial revolution was in full swing in the United States. The steam engine, which used water power to turn mills that powdered crude botanical drugs, was replaced by the gas, diesel, or electric motor. New machinery was substituted for the old whenever possible, and often machinery from other industries was adapted to the special needs of pharmaceutical manufacturing. Mixers from the baking industry, centrifugal machines from the laundry industry, and sugarcoating pans from the candy industry were a\n\n0002035880.INDD 10\n\nfew examples of improvisations. Production increased rapidly, but the new industry had to wait for the scientific revolution before it could claim newer and better drugs for mankind. A symbiosis between science and the advancing technology was needed. By 1880, the industrial manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceutical products had become well established in this country, and the pharmacist was relying heavily on commercial sources for drug supply. Synthetic organic chemistry began to have its influence on drug therapy. The isolation of some active constituents of plant drugs led to the knowledge of their chemical structure. From this arose methods of synthetically duplicating the same structures, as well as manipulating molecular structure to produce organic chemicals yet undiscovered in nature. In 1872, the synthesis of salicylic acid from phenol inaugurated the synthesis of a group of analgesic compounds including acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), which was introduced into medicine in 1899. Among other chemicals synthesized for the first time were sleep-producing derivatives of barbituric acid called barbiturates. This new source of drugs—synthetic organic chemistry—welcomed the turn into the 20th century. Until this time, drugs created through the genius of the synthetic organic chemist relieved a host of maladies, but none had been found to be curative—none, that is, until 1910, when arsphenamine, a specific agent against syphilis, was introduced to medical science. This was the start of an era of chemotherapy, an era in which the diseases of humans became curable through the use of specific chemical agents. The concepts, discoveries, and inspirational work that led mankind to this glorious period are credited to Paul Ehrlich, the German bacteriologist who together with a Japanese colleague, Sahachiro Hata, discovered arsphenamine. Today many of our drugs originate in the flask of the synthetic organic chemist. The advancement of science, both basic and applied, led to drugs of a more complex nature and to more of them. The standards advanced by the USP were more than ever needed to protect the public by ensuring the purity and uniformity of drugs.\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:57 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nWhen the American Pharmaceutical Asso­ ciation (APhA) was organized in 1852, the only authoritative and recognized book of drug standards available was the third revision of the USP. To serve as a therapeutic guide to the medical profession, its scope, then as now, was restricted to drugs of established therapeutic merit. Because of strict selectivity, many drugs and formulas that were accepted and used by the medical profession were not granted admission to early revisions of the USP. As a type of protest, and in keeping with the original objectives of the APhA to standardize drugs and formulas, certain pharmacists, with the sanction of their national organization, prepared a formulary containing many of the popular drugs and formulas denied admission to the USP. The first edition was published in 1888 under the title National Formulary of Unofficial Preparations (3). The designation “unofficial preparations” reflected the protest mood of the authors, since the USP had earlier adopted the term “official” as applying to the drugs for which it provided standards. The title was changed to National Formulary (NF) on June 30, 1906, when President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the first federal Pure Food and Drug Act, designating both the USP and NF as establishing legal standards for medicinal and pharmaceutical substances. Thus the two publications became official compendia. Among other things, the law required that whenever the designation USP or NF was used or implied on drug labeling, the products must conform to the physical and chemical standards set forth in the compendium monograph. The early editions of the NF served mainly as a convenience to practicing pharmacists by providing uniform names of drugs and preparations and working directions for the small-scale manufacture of popular pharmaceutical preparations prescribed by physicians. Before 1940, the NF, like the USP, was revised every 10 years. After that date, new editions appeared every 5 years, with supplements issued periodically as necessary. In 1975, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. purchased the NF, unifying the official compendia and providing the mechanism for a single national compendium.\n\n0002035880.INDD 11\n\n11\n\nToday, the United States PharmacopeiaNational Formulary (USP-NF) is continuously revised. Revisions are available annually in hard copy and as online editions, including twice-yearly supplements and update notices on the USP Web site. Monographs for drug substances, dietary supplements, dosage forms, and compounded preparations are contained in the USP sections of the combined compendium whereas monographs for pharmaceutical excipients are contained in the NF section. A Spanish edition of the USP-NF was introduced in 2006. Presently, USP standards are used in more than 140 countries worldwide. The standards advanced by the USP and the NF are put to active use by all members of the health care industry who share the responsibility and enjoy the public's trust for ensuring the availability of quality drugs and pharmaceutical products and preparations. The term “products” is now generally used to refer to manufactured drugs and “preparations” to compounded drugs. The USP-NF is used by pharmacists, physicians, dentists, veterinarians, nurses, producers, and suppliers of bulk chemicals for use in drug production; large and small manufacturers of pharmaceutical products; drug procurement officers of various private and public health agencies and institutions; drug regulatory and enforcement agencies; and others.\n\nUSP and NF Monographs The USP and NF adopt standards for drug substances, pharmaceutical ingredients, and dosage forms reflecting the best in the current practices of medicine and pharmacy and provide suitable tests and assay procedures for demonstrating compliance with these standards. In fulfilling this function, the compendia become legal documents, every statement of which must be of a high degree of clarity and specificity. In the United States, a drug with a name recognized in the USP-NF must comply with compendial identity standards or be deemed adulterated, misbranded, or both. To avoid being deemed adulterated, such drugs also must comply with compendial standards for\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:57 PM\n\n12\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nstrength, quality, or purity, unless labeled to show all respects in which the drug differs. In addition, to avoid being deemed misbranded, drugs recognized in the USP-NF also must comply with compendial standards for packaging and labeling. Many pharmaceutical products on the market, especially combinations of therapeutic ingredients, are not described in formulation or dosage form monographs in the official compendia. However, the individual components in these products are described in monographs in the compendia, in supplements to the compendia, or in drug applications for marketing approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An example of a typical monograph for a drug substance appearing in the USP is shown in Figure 1.3. This monograph demonstrates the type of information that appears for organic medicinal agents. The initial part of the monograph consists of the official title (generic or nonproprietary name) of the drug substance. This is followed by its graphic or structural formula, empirical formula, molecular weight, established chemical names, and the drug's Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number. The CAS registry number identifies each compound uniquely in the CAS computer information retrieval system. Appearing next in the monograph is a statement of chemical purity, a cautionary statement that reflects the toxic nature of the agent, packaging and storage recommendations, and chemical and physical tests, and the prescribed method of assay to substantiate the identification and purity of the chemical. In each monograph, the standards set forth are specific to the individual therapeutic agent, pharmaceutical material, or dosage form product/preparation to ensure purity, potency, and quality.\n\nOther Pharmacopeias In addition to the USP and the NF, other references to drug standards, such as the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS) and the Pharmacopeia Internationalis, or International Pharmacopeia (IP), p ­rovide\n\n0002035880.INDD 12\n\nadditional guidelines for drug ­ quality required by certain practitioners and ­agencies. HPUS is used by pharmacists and homeopathists as well as by law enforcement agencies that must ensure the quality of homeopathic drugs. The term homeopathy was coined by Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843) from the Greek homoios, meaning ­similar, and pathos, meaning disease. In essence, the basis of homeopathy is the law of similars, or that like cures like: that is, a drug that produces symptoms of the illness in healthy persons will also be capable of treating those same symptoms and curing the disease. Embodied in the homeopathic approach are (a) the testing of a drug on healthy persons to find the drug's effects so that it may be employed against the same symptoms manifesting a disease in an ill person; (b) the use of only minute doses of drugs in therapy, employed in dilutions expressed as “1X” (a 1:10 dilution), “2X” (a 1:100 dilution), and so on; (c) the administration of not more than one drug at a time; and (d) the treatment of the entire symptom complex of the patient, not just one symptom (4–6). The HPUS is essential for pharmacists who prepare drugs to be used in the practice of homeopathy. The IP is published by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations with the cooperation of member countries. It is intended as a recommendation to national pharmacopeial revision committees to modify their pharmacopeias according to international standards. It has no legal authority, only the respect and recognition accorded it by the participating countries in their effort to provide acceptable drug standards on an international basis. The first volume of the IP was published in 1951. It has been revised periodically since that time. Over the years, a number of countries have published their own pharmacopeias, including the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, India, Mexico, Norway, and the People's Republic of China. These pharmacopeias and the European Pharmacopeia (EP or Ph Eur) are used within their legal jurisdictions and by multinational pharmaceutical companies that develop and market products\n\n11/29/2013 3:16:57 PM\n\n13\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy O HO\n\nO\n\nO N H\n\nCH3\n\nN S\n\nImpurities\n\nOH\n\nCH3\n\nOrganic Impurities 3 H2O\n\nNH2 C16H19N3O5S·3H2O 419.45\n\n• Procedure Solution A: 2.72 g/L of monobasic potassium phosphate.

Countries not h ­aving a national pharmacopeia frequently adopt one of another country for use in setting and regulating drug standards. Selection of the pharmacopeia is usually based on geographic proximity, a common heritage or language, or a similarity of drugs and pharmaceutical products used. For example, Canada, which does not have its own national pharmacopeia, has traditionally used USP–NF standards. The Mexican pharmacopeia (Farmacopea de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos) and the Brazilian Pharmacopeia (Farmacopeia Brasilieira) are the only other actively maintained pharmacopeias in this hemisphere. The Brazilian Pharmacopoeia is part of the MERCOSUR Pharmacopoeia, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay (7).\n\nStandards Set Forth in FDAApproved New Drug Applications In the United States, in addition to the official compendia, some initial drug and drug product standards and assay methods are established as set forth in new drug applications approved by the FDA (see Chapter 2). The manufacturer must rigidly adhere to these initial standards to maintain product quality and continued FDA approval for marketing. Ultimately, these or subsequently developed standards are adopted as new monographs by the USP–NF.\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization The International Organization for Stan­ dardization (ISO) is an international consortium of representative bodies constituted to develop and promote uniform or harmonized international standards. Representing the United States in the consortium is the American National Standards Institute. Among the various ISO standards used in the pharmaceutical industry are those in the series ISO 9000 to ISO 9004. Included here are standards pertaining to development, production, quality assurance (QA), quality control (QC), detection of defective products, quality management (QM), and other issues,\n\n0002035880.INDD 15\n\n15\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nsuch as product safety and liability. Industry compliance with the standards is voluntary. However, many firms find it advantageous to their business to comply with ISO standards and to be identified within their industry as having an internationally recognized QM system. Some companies choose to become ISO certified through a rigorous evaluation and accreditation process (8).\n\nDrug Regulation And Control The first federal law in the United States designed to regulate drug products manufactured domestically was the Food and Drug Act of 1906. The law required drugs marketed interstate to comply with their claimed standards for strength, purity, and quality. Manufacturers' claims of therapeutic benefit were not regulated until 1912, when the passage of the Sherley Amendment specifically prohibited false claims of therapeutic effects, declaring such products misbranded.\n\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 The need for additional drug standards was tragically demonstrated in 1938. The thennew wonder drug sulfanilamide, which was not soluble in most common pharmaceutical solvents of the day, was prepared and distributed by an otherwise reputable manufacturer as an elixir using as the solvent diethylene glycol, a highly toxic agent used in antifreeze solutions. Before the product could be removed from the market, more than 100 persons died of diethylene glycol poisoning. The necessity for proper product formulation and thorough pharmacologic and toxicologic testing of the therapeutic agent, pharmaceutical ingredients, and the completed product was painfully recognized. Congress responded with the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and the creation of the FDA to administer and enforce it. The 1938 Act prohibits the distribution and use of any new drug or drug product without\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:00 PM\n\n16\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nthe prior filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) and approval of the FDA. It became the responsibility of the FDA to either grant or deny permission to manufacture and distribute a new product after reviewing the applicant's filed data on the product's ingredients, methods of assay and quality standards, formulation and manufacturing processes, preclinical (animal, tissue, or cell culture) studies including pharmacology and toxicology, and clinical trials on human subjects. Although the Act of 1938 required manufactured pharmaceutical products to be safe for human use, it did not require them to be efficacious. Subsequent legislation, as described later in this chapter, requires that a drug approved for marketing in the United States be both safe and effective for the condition for which it is intended. Many drugs that had been on the market prior to this Act were allowed to remain on the market if their formula was unchanged and they were “grandfathered” in by the Act: examples include selected dosage forms of ­acetaminophen, codeine phosphate, codeine sulfate, hydrocodone, levothyroxine, morphine, nitroglycerin, oxycodone, pilocarpine hydrochloride, potassium chloride, potassium iodide, sodium fluoride, and others.\n\nDurham-Humphrey Amendment of 1951 The Durham-Humphrey Amendment of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act established a legal distinction between prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) or nonprescription drugs. Until that time, all drugs could be purchased over the counter by consumers. Medications deemed safe enough by the FDA for self-treatment are made available to consumers for direct purchase whereas medications requiring professional diagnosis for their safe and effective use must be dispensed only upon a valid prescription or institutional medication order. Prescription drugs must bear the symbol “Rx Only” or the legend “Caution: Federal Law Prohibits Dispensing Without Prescription.” New drug substances are limited to prescription-only\n\n0002035880.INDD 16\n\ndispensing. However, their legal status may be changed to OTC, albeit usually at lower recommended dosage, should they later be considered useful and safe enough for the lay person's discretionary use. Examples of such drugs include ibuprofen, ketoprofen, cimetidine, loratadine, and ranitidine. According to the Durham-Humphrey Amendment, prescriptions for legend drugs may not be refilled (dispensed again after the initial filling of the prescription) without the express consent of the prescriber. The refill status of prescriptions for certain legend drugs known to be subject to public abuse was further regulated with the passage of the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 and then by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.\n\nKefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962 A tragedy in 1960 led to the passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. A new synthetic drug, thalidomide, recommended as a sedative and tranquilizer, was being sold OTC in Europe. It was a drug of special interest because of its apparent lack of toxicity even at extreme dosage levels. It was hoped that it would replace the barbiturates as a sedative and therefore prevent the frequent deaths caused from accidental and intentional barbiturate overdosage. A pharmaceutical company was awaiting FDA approval for marketing in the United States when reports of a toxic effect of the drug's use in Europe began to appear. Thalidomide given to women during pregnancy produced birth defects, most notably phocomelia, an arrested development of the limbs of the affected newborn. Thousands of children were affected to various extents (9). Some were born without arms or legs and others, with partially formed limbs. The more fortunate were born with only disfigurations of the nose, eyes, and ears. The most severely afflicted died of malformation of the heart or gastrointestinal tract. This drug catastrophe spurred the Congress to strengthen the existing laws regarding new drugs. Without\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:00 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\ndissent, on October 10, 1962, the KefauverHarris Drug Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 were passed by both houses of Congress. The purpose of the enactment was to ensure a greater degree of safety for approved drugs, and manufacturers were now required to prove a drug both safe and effective before it would be granted FDA approval for marketing. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended, the sponsor of a new drug is required to file an investigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA before the drug may be clinically tested on human subjects. Only after carefully designed and structured human clinical trials, in which the drug is evaluated for safety and effectiveness, may the drug's sponsor file an NDA seeking approval for marketing. The FDA was given authority to issue good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines governing how drugs were to be manufactured, access to facilities for inspection, and jurisdiction over prescription drug advertising. The requirements for these and other submissions to the FDA are presented in Chapter 2. Interestingly, WHO now considers thalidomide to be the standard treatment for the fever and painful skin lesions associated with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) in patients with leprosy and the FDA has approved its use for this purpose. Further, research into potential uses for thalidomide has determined that it is effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a blood and bone marrow cancer, and shows promise in certain inflammatory diseases, and in Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer of the blood vessel walls mostly found in people with HIV (10).\n\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (now referred to as the Controlled Substances Act [CSA]) served to consolidate and codify control authority over drugs of abuse into a single statute. Under its provisions, the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, and other related laws governing\n\n0002035880.INDD 17\n\n17\n\nstimulants, depressants, narcotics, and hallucinogens were repealed and replaced by regulatory framework now administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the Department of Justice. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Pre­ vention and Control Act of 1970 established five “schedules” for the classification and control of drug substances that are subject to abuse. These schedules provide for decreasing levels of control, from schedule I to schedule V. The drugs in the five schedules may be described as follows: • Schedule I: Drugs with no accepted medical use, or other substances with a high potential for abuse. In this category are agents including heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, peyote, methaqualone, marijuana, and similar items. Any nonmedical substance that is being abused can be placed in this category. • Schedule II: Drugs with accepted medical uses and a high potential for abuse that if abused may lead to severe psychologic or physical dependence. In this category are morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine, amobarbital, and other such drugs. • Schedule III: Drugs with accepted medical uses and a potential for abuse less than those listed in schedules I and II that if abused may lead to moderate psychologic or physical dependence. In this category are specified quantities of codeine, hydrocodone, and similar agents. • Schedule IV: Drugs with accepted medical uses and low potential for abuse relative to those in Schedule III that if abused may lead to limited physical dependence or psychologic dependence relative to drugs in schedule III. In this category are specified quantities of difenoxin, diazepam, oxazepam, and similar agents. • Schedule V: Drugs with accepted medical uses and low potential for abuse relative to those in schedule IV that if abused may lead to limited physical dependence or psychologic dependence relative to drugs in schedule IV. Included in this category are specified quantities of dihydrocodeine, diphenoxylate, and similar agents.\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:00 PM\n\n18\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nFDA Pregnancy Categories Appropriate prescribing and use of medications requires a risk-versus-benefit assessment of the medication for a specific patient. There are many risk factors that must be evaluated, including pregnancy. In 1979, the United States FDA introduced a classification of fetal risks due to pharmaceuticals. This was based on a similar system that was introduced in Sweden just 1 year earlier. The FDA has established five categories that can be used to estimate the potential of a systemically absorbed drug for causing birth defects. The reliability of the documentation is the key differentiation factor among the categories for determining the risk-versusbenefit ratio. The Pregnancy Category “X” is the strongest and states that if any data exist that a drug may be implicated as a teratogen and the risk-versus-benefit ratio does not support the use of the drug, then the drug is contraindicated during pregnancy. The FDA-assigned pregnancy categories are as follows: • Category A: Adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters). • Category B: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and there are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. • Category C: Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. • Category D: There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. • Category X: Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of\n\n0002035880.INDD 18\n\n­ uman fetal risk based on adverse reach tion data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.\n\nMedication Exposures During Pregnancy and Lactation Every woman in the general population has a 3% to 5% risk of having a child with a birth defect or mental retardation. Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. Two important factors to consider when assessing the teratogenic potential of a medication are the stage of pregnancy at which the exposure occurred and the amount of medication taken. It is critical to evaluate each exposure on a case-by-case basis in order to give an accurate risk assessment. Some of the known, possible, and unlikely human teratogens are listed in Table 1.1. In a pregnant or breast-feeding patient who is currently taking, or considering taking, a medication, the patient needs to be counseled about potential adverse effects the medication could have on her fetus or infant (11). This counseling needs to be documented.\n\nBlack Box Warnings A black box warning in prescription drug labeling is used to call attention to one of the following situations: (a) there is an adverse reaction so serious in proportion to the potential benefit that it be considered in assessing the risks and benefits of using the drug, (b) the risk of a serious adverse reaction can be prevented or reduced in severity by careful use of the drug (e.g., patient selection, special monitoring, certain concomitant therapy), or (c) the FDA has approved the drug with restrictions to prescribing/distribution to ensure its safe use (12).\n\nDrug Listing Act of 1972 The Drug Listing Act was enacted to provide the FDA with the legislative authority to compile a list of marketed drugs to assist in the enforcement of federal laws requiring that drugs be safe and effective and not\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:01 PM\n\n19\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nTable 1.1 Some Known Teratogens RADIATION\n\nMercury, organic\n\nAtomic weapons\n\nMethimazole\n\nRadioiodine\n\nMethotrexate (methylaminopterin)\n\nTherapeutic radiation\n\nMethylene blue (via intra-amniotic injection)\n\nINFECTIONS\n\nMisoprostol\n\nCytomegalovirus\n\nPenicillamine\n\nHerpes simplex virus I and II\n\nPhenytoin\n\nParvovirus B-19 (erythema infectiosum)\n\nTetracyclines\n\nRubella virus\n\nThalidomide\n\nSyphilis Toxoplasmosis Varicella virus\n\nToluene (abuse) Trimethadione Valproic acid\n\nVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus\n\nPOSSIBLE TERATOGENS\n\nMATERNAL AND METABOLIC IMBALANCE\n\nBinge drinking\n\nAlcoholism\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nAmniocentesis, early (before day 70 post conception)\n\nColchicine\n\nChorionic villus sampling (before day 60 post conception)\n\nErgotamine\n\nCretinism, endemic Diabetes Folic acid deficiency\n\nDisulfiram Glucocorticoids Lead Primidone Quinine (suicidal doses)\n\nHyperthermia\n\nStreptomycin\n\nMyasthenia gravis\n\nVitamin A (high doses)\n\nPhenylketonuria\n\nZidovudine (AZT)\n\nRheumatic disease\n\nZinc deficiency\n\nSjögren syndrome Virilizing tumors DRUGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS\n\nACE inhibitors (benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, quinapril, ramipril, trandolapril) Aminopterin Androgenic hormones Busulfan Chlorobiphenyls Cigarette smoking\n\nUNLIKELY TERATOGENS\n\nAgent Orange Anesthetics Aspartame Aspirin (but aspirin in the second half of pregnancy may increase cerebral hemorrhage during delivery) Bendectin (antinauseant) Electromagnetic waves Hydroxyprogesterone LSD\n\nCocaine\n\nMarijuana\n\nCoumarin anticoagulants\n\nMedroxyprogesterone\n\nCyclophosphamide\n\nMetronidazole\n\nDiethylstilbestrol\n\nOral contraceptives\n\nEtretinate\n\nProgesterone\n\nFluconazole (high doses)\n\nRubella vaccine\n\nIodides\n\nSpermicides\n\nIsotretinoin (Accutane)\n\nVideo display terminals\n\nLithium\n\nUltrasound\n\n0002035880.INDD 19\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:01 PM\n\n20\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nadulterated or misbranded. Under the regulations of the act, each firm that manufactures or repackages drugs for ultimate sale or distribution to patients or consumers must register with the FDA and submit appropriate information for listing. All foreign drug manufacturing and distributing firms whose products are imported into the United States are also included in this regulation. Exempt from the registration and listing requirements are hospitals, clinics, and the various health practitioners who compound pharmaceutical preparations for use in their respective institutions and practices. Also exempt are research and teaching institutions in which drug products are prepared for purposes other than sale. Each registrant is assigned a permanent registration number, following the format of the National Drug Code (NDC) numbering system. Under this system, the first four numbers, the labeler code of the 10-character code, identify the manufacturer or distributor. The last six numbers identify the drug formulation and the trade package size and type. The segment that identifies the drug formulation is the product code, and the segment that identifies the trade package size and type is the package code. The manufacturer or distributor determines the ratio of use of the last six digits for the two codes, as a 3:3 digit product code to package code configuration (e.g., 542–112) or a 4:2 digit configuration (e.g., 5421–12). Only one such type of configuration may be selected for use by a manufacturer or distributor, who then assigns a code number to each product to be included in the drug listing. A final code number is presented as the example: NDC 0081-5421-12. The NDC numbers appear on all manufacturers' drug labeling. In some instances, manufacturers imprint the NDC number, or a part of the NDC number, directly on the dosage units, such as capsules and tablets, for rapid and positive identification when the number is matched in the NDC Directory or against a decoding list provided by the manufacturer. Once a number is assigned to a drug product, it is a permanent assignment. Even when a drug manufacturer discontinues the\n\n0002035880.INDD 20\n\nmanufacture and distribution of a product, the number may not be used again. If a drug product is substantially changed, as through an alteration in the active ingredients, dosage form, or product name, the registrant assigns a new NDC number and advises the FDA accordingly. The product information is now received by the FDA electronically from each registrant, processed and stored in computer files, and made available in web-based format. A search of the Drug Code Directory may be done online by proprietary name, application number, active ingredient, NDC number, or labeler name.\n\nOrphan Drug Act of 1983 Drugs intended for the treatment of “rare diseases and conditions” may be designated orphan drugs to help promote research on rare diseases. “Rare” diseases are defined as diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people or diseases that affect more than 200,000 people but where circumstances are such that a company is unlikely to recover its research and development costs. The law provides tax credits and designated years of marketing exclusivity as incentives.\n\nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 Changes to speed FDA approval of generic drugs and the extension of patent life for innovative new drugs were the major components of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act of 1984. Under the provisions of the legislation, applications for generic copies of an originally approved new drug can be filed through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), and the extensive animal and human studies of an NDA are not required. This reduces considerably the time and expense of bringing a generic version of the drug to market. The FDA evaluates the chemistry, manufacturing, control (CMC) standards, and the drug's bioavailability in determining that the generic version is\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:01 PM\n\nequivalent to the originally approved drug. Since 1984, over 10,000 generic drug products have entered the market, and generic drugs now account for about 70% of prescriptions dispensed. For holders of patented drugs, the legislation provides an extension of patent life equal to the time required for FDA review of the NDA plus half the time spent in the testing phase, up to a maximum of 5 years and not to exceed the usual 20-year patent term. This extends the effective patent life and exclusive marketing period for innovative new drug products, thereby encouraging pioneering research and development.\n\nPrescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 established new safeguards on the integrity of the nation's supply of prescription drugs. The act is intended to reduce the risks of adulterated, misbranded, repackaged, or mislabeled drugs entering the legitimate marketplace through “secondary sources.” The primary sections of the Act are summarized as follows: 1. Reimportation: Prohibits the reimportation of drug products manufactured in the United States except by the manufacturer of the product. 2. Sales restrictions: Prohibits selling, trading, purchasing, or the offer to sell, trade, or purchase a drug sample. It also prohibits resale by health care institutions of pharmaceuticals purchased explicitly for the use of the institution. Charitable institutions that receive drugs at reduced prices or no cost cannot resell the drugs. 3. Distribution of samples: Samples may be distributed only to (a) practitioners licensed to prescribe such drugs and (b) at the written request of the practitioner, to pharmacies of hospitals or other health care institutions. 4. Wholesale distributors: Manufacturers are required to maintain a list of their authorized distributors.\n\n0002035880.INDD 21\n\n21\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, first passed in 1992 and subsequently renewed, allows the FDA to accept user fees from drug and biologic companies in return for committing to review new drug and biologic applications within certain time frames. The Act is credited with a more rapid application review process and the speedier approval of new drug products. The third enactment, passed as part of the “Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,” included designated resources for postmarketing studies to monitor the continuing safety and efficacy of new drug products.\n\nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2006 In passing the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, Con­ gress recognized the growing interest in the use of various herbs and dietary supplements and addressed the need to regulate the labeling claims made for these products. These products, which include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and botanicals, legally are not considered drugs if they have not been submitted for review on NDAs and thus have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy by the FDA. However, as with drugs, their safe use is a concern to the FDA. The act forbids manufacturers or distributors of these products to make any advertising or labeling claims that indicate that the use of the product can prevent or cure a specific disease. In fact, a disclaimer must appear on the product: “This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” However, the law does permit claims of benefit as they may properly relate to a nutrient deficiency disease or, based on scientific evidence, how an ingredient may affect the body's “structure or function” (e.g., increase circulation or lower cholesterol) or\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:01 PM\n\n22\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nhow use of the product can affect a person's general well-being. But before any promotional or labeling claims may be made, they first must be submitted to the FDA as being truthful and not misleading (13). The use of herbs and nutritional supplements is part of today's milieu of “alternative” therapies, and as such is receiving increased attention on the part of the scientific community and the FDA. Many of these agents, including ginseng, Ginkgo, saw palmetto, St. John's wort, and Echinacea, are used worldwide and have been the subject of literature reports and research conducted in Europe and Asia. In 1997, a report of the U.S. Presidential Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels called for more research in this country on the health benefits of dietary supplements. In response, academic and National Institutes of Health (NIH) studies are assessing the therapeutic usefulness of some of these agents and to determine their safety. The USP–NF has adopted standards for many of these products using marker ingredients that must be present within specified ranges if the product is labeled USP–NF. The USP also has a voluntary Dietary Supplement Verification program in place. Participants who meet USP's criteria can place a logo on the label of their product signifying their compliance with USP standards (Fig. 1.4).\n\nFIGURE 1.4 USP Verified Mark on dietary supplement label assures consumers receive expected value. (Reprinted with permission of United States Pharmacopeia.)\n\n0002035880.INDD 22\n\nThe “Dietary Supplement and Non­ prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2006” enabled the FDA to implement a policy of GMPs for dietary supplements similar to those in place for pharmaceutical products. This requires that dietary supplements are manufactured according to quality standards, that all ingredients listed are in the declared amounts, that they are properly packaged and accurately labeled, and that complete manufacturing and QC records are maintained along with a system for the identification and reporting of serious adverse events.\n\nThe FDA and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 As noted previously, the FDA was established in 1938 to administer and enforce the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Starting with this initial authority, today the FDA is responsible for enforcing many additional pieces of legislation. The mission of the FDA is to protect the public health against risks associated with the production, distribution, and sale of food and food additives, human drugs and biologicals, radiologic and medical devices, animal drugs and feeds, and cosmetics. In carrying out the intent of legislation it is mandated to enforce, the FDA • Sets policies, establishes standards, issues guidelines, and promulgates and enforces rules and regulations governing the affected industries and their products • Monitors for regulatory compliance through reporting requirements, product sampling and testing, and establishment inspections • Establishes product labeling requirements, disseminates product use and safety information, issues product warnings, and directs product recalls • Acts as the government's gatekeeper in making safe and effective new drugs, clinical laboratory tests, and medical devices available through a carefully conducted application and review process\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:02 PM\n\nChapter 1 • Introduction to Drugs and Pharmacy\n\nThe FDA, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, is organized into appropriate units to support its various responsibilities and functions. A complete and detailed FDA organizational chart may be found on the agency's Web site: http:// www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/ OrganizationCharts/default.htm. A listing of some primary offices include • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •\n\nOffice of the Commissioner Office of Policy and Planning Office of the Chief Scientist National Center for Toxicological Research Office of Women's Health Office of Minority Health Office of Foods Center for Veterinary Medicine Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Office of Medical Products and Tobacco Center for Devices and Radiological Health Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Office of Global Regulatory Operations and Policy Office of Regulatory Affairs\n\nEach of these offices and centers has a highly organized substructure and personnel to address agency policy, regulations, and operational responsibilities. The CDER and the CBER are responsible for the drug and biologicals approval process as described in Chapter 2. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was enacted to streamline FDA policies and to codify many of the agency's newer regulations (14). The bill expanded patient access to investigational treatments for AIDS, cancer, Alzheimer disease, and other serious or life-threatening illnesses. It also provided for faster new drug approvals by using drug sponsors' fees to hire additional internal reviewers, by the authorized use of external reviewers, and by changes in the requirements demonstrating a drug's clinical effectiveness. It also provided incentives for investigations of drugs for children.\n\n0002035880.INDD 23\n\n23\n\nThe legislation included provisions to track clinical trial data in a joint program with the NIH, established a system to follow and review studies of the safety and efficacy of marketed drug products, established a program for the dissemination of information on off-label uses of marketed drugs and encouraged applications for additional therapeutic indications, and fostered the expansion of the FDA's information management system and the agency's progress toward paperless systems for human drug applications. To codify, enable, and enforce legislative authority, the FDA develops relevant guidelines and regulations. These are first published in the Federal Register (FR) for public comment, and when finalized, in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nGlobalization and the FDA The responsibility of the Federal Food and Drug Administration to protect the public health by assuring the safety and efficacy of the drugs and other products it regulates has become increasingly complex in recent years by the rapidly expanding globalization of the marketplace. Data indicate that 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and 40% of the finished dosage forms used in the United States are imported (15). FDAregulated products originate in over 150 countries, are produced in approximately 300,000 foreign facilities and are distributed by 130,000 importers (15). In addressing this challenge, the FDA has established foreign operational offices in receptive supplier countries around the world and has increased inspections of foreign supplier facilities. In addition, the FDA is working to develop internationally accepted quality and safety standards through coalitions with foreign counterpart agencies and together, they are generating global data information systems and mechanisms to identify and quickly address potential risks irrespective of geographic location (15). It should be noted that the activities of the United States Pharmacopeia are also\n\n11/29/2013 3:17:02 PM\n\n24\n\nSECTION I • Drugs, Drug Dosage Forms, And Drug Delivery Systems\n\nworldwide in scope nowadays, with physical operations in key international manufacturing and distribution sites.\n\nDrug Product Recall If the FDA or a manufacturer finds that a marketed product presents a threat or a potential threat to consumer safety, that product may be recalled or sought for return to the manufacturer from its depth of distribution. The pharmaceutical manufacturer is legally bound to report serious unlabeled adverse reactions to the FDA through the FDA MedWatch Program (800-FDA-1088 or www.FDA.gov). A practitioner also has a responsibility to report a problem with any drug product or medical device using the MedWatch program. Reported problems may include product defects, product adulteration, container leakage, improper labeling, unexpected adverse reactions, and others. A drug product recall may be initiated by the FDA or by the manufacturer, the latter being termed a voluntary recall. A numerical classification, as follows, indicates the degree of hazard associated with the product being recalled: • Class I: There is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. • Class II: The use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. • Class III: The use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. The depth of recall, or the level of market removal or correction (e.g., wholesaler, retailer, consumer), depends on the nature of the product, the urgency of the situation, and depth to which the product has been distributed. The lot numbers of packaging control numbers on the containers or labels of the products help in identifying the product to be recalled.\n\n0002035880.INDD 24\n\nDrug Products Removed or Withdrawn The following drug products were withdrawn or removed from the market because such drug products or components of such drug products were found to be unsafe or not effective. Thus, the products, as listed may not be compounded under the provisions of section 503A(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It is important to note that not all dosage forms of the drugs listed have been removed or cannot be compounded because in some situations, it is select dosage forms.
