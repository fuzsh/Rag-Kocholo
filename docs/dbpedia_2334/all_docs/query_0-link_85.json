Hickman The purpose of this chapter is to provide the learner with the tools necessary to understand the nursing theories presented in this text. These tools include learning the language and definitions of theoretical thinking, acquiring a perspective of the historical development of nursing theories, and learning methods to analyze and evaluate nursing theories. Understanding nursing theory is the prerequisite to choosing and using a theory to guide one’s nursing practice. Nursing theories have developed from the choices and assumptions about the nature of what a particular theorist believes about nursing, what the basis of nursing knowledge is, and what nurses do or how they practice in the real world. Each theory carries with it a worldview, a way of seeing nursing and human events that highlights certain aspects of reality and possibly shades or ignores aspects in other areas (Ray, 1998). Each theorist was influenced by her or his own values, the historical context of the discipline of nursing, and a knowledge base rooted in the world of nursing science.\n\nA FEW WORDS ABOUT NURSING SCIENCE . . . What nursing science is, and what it is not, is a topic of significant debate in the current nursing literature. This is especially true now in the early years of a new century, after nearly two decades of cost containment, nursing shortages, staffing reductions, and managed care. Despite (or in spite of) a health care delivery situation in the United States that is unfriendly for both nurses and clients, thinking about nursing science has achieved some areas of consensus on an international level. In 1997, Nursing Science Quarterly presented an international dialogue on the question: “What is nursing science?” (Barrett et al., 1997). In the following responses, note the patterns of agreement of thinking from the different respondents.\n\nDr. John Daly—Australia: Nursing science is an identifiable, discrete body of knowledge comprising paradigms, frameworks, and theories. . . . This structure is vested in nursing’s totality and simultaneity paradigms. These competing paradigms posit From Chapter 1 of Nursing Theories: The Base for Professional Nursing Practice, 6/e.

Nursing science-based practice is the imaginative and creative use of nursing knowledge to promote the health and well-being of all people. . . . (p. 12)\n\nDr. William K. Cody—United States of America: The discipline of nursing requires knowledge and methods other than nursing science, but nursing science is the essence of nursing as a scholarly discipline; without it, there would be no nursing, only care. . . . As a science, nursing’s richness is manifest in the availability of cutting-edge philosophies and theories to provide guidance for practice, . . . and a growing body of literature describing nursing theory-based practice . . . (pp. 12–13).\n\n14\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nANOTHER VIEW Meleis (2007) speaks specifically of nursing as a human science that focuses on human beings as wholes and has at its core an understanding of experiences as lived by its members. She states that, from a human science view, the art and science of nursing are inseparable. Nursing as a human science is concerned with the experiences of human beings with health and illness and requires both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies.\n\nTHE LANGUAGE OF THEORETICAL THINKING The previous section of this chapter presented current thinking about the definition of nursing science from international experts. Clearly it has been a long journey from Nightingale’s Notes on Nursing (1859/1992) to the state of nursing science in the early 21st century! This chapter will provide you with the tools to examine the theories that were developed by nurses during this more than 140-year period. As you proceed through this text, the commentary in the previous section will take on new and different meanings. You are about to begin a new journey that will take you into the realm of theoretical thinking in nursing as it evolved in the context of nursing history. This journey will provide you with an appreciation of the implications of nursing theory for professional nursing practice, nursing science, and nursing research. Concepts The first unit to consider in the language of theoretical thinking is the concept. A concept is an idea, thought, or notion conceived in the mind. Concepts may be empirical or abstract, depending on their ability to be observed in the real world. Concepts are said to empirical when they can be observed or experienced through the senses. A stethoscope is an example of an empirical concept; it can be seen and touched. Abstract concepts are those that are not observable, such as caring, hope, and infinity. All concepts become abstractions in the absence of the object. For example, once you have become familiar with a stethoscope, you are able to see the concept of a stethoscope in your mind, without having one physically present. Abstractions such as caring, hope, or infinity are more difficult to picture, as one has never had the opportunity to observe these concepts in reality. To understand the presentations of nursing theories in this text, it will be of critical importance to look at the definitions of the concepts provided. Some of the theories will use concepts with which you are familiar, but they may be used in unfamiliar ways; others will introduce new concepts, some with new or unfamiliar labels. The term metaparadigm is defined as the core content of a discipline, stated in the most global or abstract of terms. Kim (1989) states that the functions of a metaparadigm are to summarize the intellectual and social missions of a discipline and to place a boundary on the subject matter of that discipline. Until the 1990s there was general agreement in the literature that the metaparadigm of the discipline of nursing consisted of four major concepts: person, health, environment, and nursing. Each of these four concepts was presented as an abstraction. Specific definitions of each of the four concepts differed depending on the author. For the purposes of this text, the following general definitions will be used. Person may represent an individual, a family, a community, or all of humankind. In this context, person is the focus of nursing practice. Health represents a state of well-being as defined by the person or mutually decided on by the person and the nurse. Environment represents the person’s physical surroundings, the community, or the universe and all it contains. Nursing is the practice of the science and art of the discipline.\n\n15\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nSome of the current literature suggests that a four-concept metaparadigm for the discipline of nursing is too restrictive. Meleis (2007) maintains that the domain of nursing knowledge encompasses seven concepts: nursing client, transitions, interaction, nursing process, environment, nursing therapeutics, and health. Parse (1995a) states that the major phenomena of concern to nursing include self-care, adaptation, interpersonal relations, goal attainment, caring, energy fields, human becoming, and others. To these, Cody (1996) adds the concerns of nursing’s unique traditions of respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of each client—dimensions of the discipline that he believes find no expression in a metaparadigm limited to concepts and their definitions. Malinski (1995) suggests dropping the entire idea of a metaparadigm of nursing, as she considers it to be no longer warranted. She states that as nursing is now more diverse than homogeneous, any attempt to define the scope of the discipline will be so broad as to be meaningless. Despite the scholarly controversies regarding metaparadigms and their current status (or lack of status) in nursing science, it is important to consider their impact on theory development in nursing. In analyzing the theories in this text, the reader will be able to identify the presence (or absence) of global or metaparadigm concepts upon which the different theories are based (or not based). The chapter will discuss the theorists’ definitions or viewpoints on the original four-concept metaparadigm of person, health, environment, and nursing as well as consider other concepts in each theory.\n\nTHEORIES Concepts are the elements used to generate theories. Chinn and Kramer (2004) define a theory as “a creative and rigorous structuring of ideas that projects a tentative, purposeful, and systematic view of phenomena” (p. 58). They state that the word creative underscores the role of human imagination and vision in theory development but caution that the creative processes are also rigorous, systematic, and disciplined. In their view, theories are tentative and, as such, are open to revision as new evidence emerges. Their definition of theory requires that there be a purpose for the theory. Simply stated, a theory suggests a direction in how to view facts and events. Theories cannot be equated with scientific laws, which predict the results of given experiments 100% of the time. Laws compose the basis of most of the natural sciences. As nursing is a human science, the rigor and objectivity of the laboratory-produced data are both inappropriate and impossible to replicate. The predictability of nursing theories becomes more reliable as the research base from which theories develop grows. Meleis (2007) defines nursing theory as “. . . a conceptualization of some aspect of nursing reality communicated for the purpose of describing phenomena, explaining relationships between phenomena, predicting consequences, or prescribing nursing care” (p. 37). This definition includes the importance of communicating nursing theory and the purpose of prescribing nursing care. Theories are composed of concepts (and their definitions) and propositions that explain the relationships between the concepts. For example, Nightingale proposed a beneficial relationship between fresh air and health. Theories are based on stated assumptions that are presented as givens. Theoretical assumptions may be taken as “truth” because they cannot be empirically tested, such as in a value statement or ethic. Theories may be presented as models that provide a diagram or map of the theory’s content. Barnum (1998) states that a complete nursing theory is one that contains context, content, and process. Context is the environment in which the nursing act takes place.\n\n16\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nContent is the subject of the theory. Process is the method by which the nurse acts in using the theory. The nurse acts on, with, or through the content elements of the theory. Smith and Liehr (2003) suggest picturing a ladder of abstraction consisting of three rungs. In this model, the highest rung represents the philosophical, the middle rung represents the theoretical, and the lowest rung represents the empirical. The philosophical level “represents [the] beliefs and assumptions that are accepted as true and fundamental to a theory” (p. 1). The theoretical rung is abstract and consists of the symbols, ideas, and concepts that form the theory. The third rung, the empirical, is concrete and represents what can be observed by the senses. While some texts differentiate between “theories,” “conceptual models,” and “conceptual frameworks” of nursing, the majority of authors believe that this is an artificial distinction. Meleis (2007) goes so far as to say, “The attempt to differentiate between them has frequently taken on the dimension of splitting hairs and has only added to the confusion” (p. 151). For the purposes of this text, the existing nursing conceptualizations presented are theories.\n\nLEVELS OF THEORY The level of a theory refers to the scope or range of phenomena to which the theory applies. The level of abstraction of the concepts in the theory is closely tied to its scope. Chinn and Kramer (2004) state that theory may be characterized as micro, macro, midrange, atomistic, or wholistic (p. 94). Micro and atomistic suggest relatively narrowrange phenomena, while macro and wholistic imply that the theory covers a broad scope. Midrange (or middle range) theories deal with a portion of nursing’s total concern but not with the totality of the discipline. Chinn and Kramer provide the example of pain alleviation as a midrange theory and the explanation of the physiology of the phenomena known as pain as a possible micro theory. Both of these deal with a portion of the person. Macro theories deal with persons as a whole. These labels are arbitrary and may differ in different disciplines. Grand theory is a term used in the literature to mean theory that covers broad areas of concern within a discipline. In the same vein, a school of thought has been defined by Parse (1997b) as “a theoretical point of view held by a community of scholars” (p. 74). It is a tradition, including specific assumptions and principles, a specified focus of inquiry, and congruent approaches to research and practice. Metatheory is a term used to label theory about the theoretical process and theory development. Merton (1968) describes middle range theories as those “that lie between the minor but necessary working hypotheses that evolve in abundance during day-to-day research and the all-inclusive systematic efforts to develop unified theory that will explain all the observed uniformities of social behavior, social organization and social change” (p. 39). Descriptions of middle range theory in the nursing literature reflect congruency with Merton. Nurse authors have described middle range theory as follows: • Narrower in scope than grand theories (Fawcett, 2005a; Suppe, 1996) • Composed of a limited number of concepts and propositions that are written at a level that is concrete and specific (Fawcett, 2005a; McKenna, 1997) • Concerned with less abstract, more specific phenomena (Fawcett, 2005a; Meleis, 2007) • More applicable to practice (Fawcett, 2005a; Liehr & Smith, 1999)\n\n17\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nIm (2005) describes a “ready-to-wear” level of theory. Ready-to-wear refers to easy applicability to research and practice. She describes situation-specific theory as one type of ready-to-wear theory. Situation-specific theories are defined as those that focus on specific nursing phenomena, reflect clinical practice, and are limited to specific populations or specific fields of practice (Im & Meleis, 1999a). Situation-specific theories are also labeled as microtheories or practice theories. Im (2005) goes on to caution that situationspecific theories are not intended to be universal theories that can be applied to any time or setting but are rather intended to be more clinically specific, reflect a particular context, and include blueprints for nursing action(s). An example of a situation-specific theory is that proposed by Im and Meleis (1999b), which was aimed only at the specific population of menopausal low-income Korean immigrant women in the United States. Im (2005) states that situation-specific theories may or may not be testable. Theories that are developed on the philosophical bases of hermeneutics, phenomenology, or critical theory do not have testable hypotheses. These theories, rather, aim at understanding and explaining the lived experience of human beings experiencing a phenomenon. Another way of looking at levels of theory is to look at what it is that the theory does. For Dickoff and James (1968), theory develops on four levels: factor-isolating, factorrelating, situation-relating, and situation-producing. Level 1, factor-isolating, is descriptive in nature. It involves naming or classifying facts/events. Level 2, factor-relating, requires correlating or associating factors in such a way that they meaningfully depict a larger situation. Level 3, situation-relating, explains and predicts how situations are related. Level 4, situation-producing, requires sufficient knowledge about how and why situations are related, so that when using the theory as a guide, valued situations can be produced. When using this method, one speaks of the relative power of the theory, with Level 4 being the most powerful, as it controls (or does more than describe, explain, or predict). Fawcett (2005a) uses similar labels when describing middle range theory. She states that middle range theories describe what a phenomena is, explain why it occurs, or predict how it occurs. Middle range descriptive theories are the most basic type of theory, may include only one concept, and describe or classify a phenomenon. Middle range explanatory theories specify relations between two or more concepts, while middle range predictive theories predict precise relationships between concepts or the effects of one or more concepts on one or more other concepts (p. 19).\n\nWORLDVIEWS A worldview is one’s philosophical frame of reference in looking at one’s world. The worldview of the philosophy of science is that of logical empiricism. This worldview requires that all truths must be confirmed by sensory experiences. Logical empiricism requires objectivity and is relatively value free. Objectivity requires study of the smallest parts of phenomena with use of the scientific method. In this worldview, the whole is equal to the sum of its parts. In the literature, this worldview is also called the received view. It is from this view of nursing science that the nursing process was created. One of the worldviews, which opposes logical empiricism, is that of the human science or the perceived view. A human science worldview focuses on human beings as wholes and their lived experiences within a given context. Parse (1987) posits two worldviews of nursing related to the received and the perceived views. Her description of the totality paradigm reflects the received view, while her description of the simultaneity paradigm reflects the perceived view. A basic\n\n18\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\ndifference in these paradigms is the perception of person. The totality paradigm looks at the bio-psycho-social-spiritual aspects of person, while the simultaneity paradigm views person as an irreducible whole in constant interrelationship with the universe. Theorists of the totality paradigm tend to define health as a state of well-being as measured against norms, while simultaneity paradigm theorists view health as something the client determines individually. Cody (1995) affirms Parse’s position on paradigms. He states, “Basic assumptions that Parse made about the totality and simultaneity paradigms ten years ago hold true today. There really are only two sets of essential beliefs about human beings and health in nursing” (p. 146). Fawcett (2003, p. 273) proposed changing the language of the metaparadigm of nursing. She suggests that the word person be changed to human beings, that health should refer to human processes of living and dying, and that nursing actions can be viewed as a process between participants in nursing and nurses. She further suggests that the linkages between human beings, environment, health, and nursing can be stated in a way that is more inclusive of both the totality and simultaneity paradigms. The discipline of nursing is concerned with the following: 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nPrinciples that govern human processes of living and dying Patterning of human health experiences Nursing actions or processes that are beneficial to human beings Human processes of living and dying, recognizing that human beings are in continuous mutual process with their environments\n\nCIRCULAR NATURE OF THEORY-RESEARCH-PRACTICE It is important to understand that theory, research, and practice impact each other in circular ways. Middle range theories can be tested in clinical practice by nursing research. The research process may validate the theory, cause it to be modified, or invalidate it. When research validates a theory, it provides the evidence required for evidence-based practice. As more research is conducted about a specific theory, more evidence is provided to support practice. Practice is based on the theories of the discipline that are validated through research (see Figure 1). Research findings are published in the periodical literature and books, are presented at conferences, and are available through abstracts, such as Dissertation Abstracts International.\n\nPRACTICE\n\nRESEARCH\n\nTHEORY FIGURE 1 Circular nature of theory, research, and practice\n\n19\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nLiehr and Smith (1999, p. 88) propose five approaches for middle range theory generation in the 21st century: Induction through research and practice Deduction from research and practice applications of grand nursing theories Combination of existing nursing and non-nursing middle range theories Derivation from theories of other disciplines that relate to nursing’s disciplinary perspective 5.

Received-view research is quantitative, where statistical data represent empirical facts and events. The methodology of the research is based on the scientific method. Perceived-view research is qualitative in nature, based on the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of the research subjects. Numerous methodologies have been proposed to conduct qualitative research. Polit and Beck (2004) state that quantitative research tends to emphasize deductive reasoning, the rules of logic, and the measurable attributes of human experience. They state that quantitative research methods generally focus on a small number of concepts, begin with hunches as to how the concepts are related, use formal instruments and structured processes to collect data (under conditions of control), emphasize objectivity in both data collection and analysis, and analyze numerical data using statistical procedures (pp. 15–16). Qualitative research is described by Polit and Beck (2004) as emphasizing the dynamic, holistic, and individual aspects of the human experience and attempting to capture those aspects in their entirety, within the context of those experiencing them. They state that research using qualitative methods generally focuses on attempts to understand the entirety of some phenomenon rather than focusing on specific concepts; relies on the subject’s interpretation of events rather than hunches of the researcher; collects data without formal, structured instruments; does not attempt to control the context of the research but rather attempts to capture it in its entirety; capitalizes on the subjectivity of the data as a means for understanding and interpreting human experiences; and analyzes narrative data in an organized but intuitive fashion (pp. 16–17). Speziale and Carpenter (2007) caution that not all qualitative studies lead to theory development but that certain approaches used in qualitative research can lead to theory development. They state that in the instance of grounded theory, the method is dedicated to the discovery of theory. According to Haase and Meyers (1988, p. 132), quantitative and qualitative approaches differ in the following ways: 1. Quantitative methods assume a singular reality, while qualitative methods assume multiple interrelated realities 2. Quantitative methods assume that objective reality is its appropriate domain, while qualitative methods assume that subjective experiences are also legitimate 3. Quantitative methods are reductionistic, whereas qualitative methods take an ecological view—that is, they attempt to gain a full understanding of the reality 4. Quantitative methods reveal the whole through its parts, whereas qualitative methods assume that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts 5. Quantitative methods assume that discrepancies are to be accounted for or eliminated, while qualitative methods recognize that discrepancies may be existentially real Table 1 provides a comparison of quantitative and qualitative research methods.\n\n20\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory TABLE 1 Comparison of Research Methods Quantitative Cause-and-effect relationships Context free Data expressed in numerical values Deductive processes Emphasis on concepts Fixed design Measurable Mechanistic Objective One reality Reduction, control, prediction Report statistical analyses Researcher is independent Subjects\n\nQualitative Patterns of association Context dependent Data expressed in narrative descriptions Inductive processes Emphasis on the whole Flexible design Interpretative Organismic Subjectivity is desirable Multiple subjective realities Discovery, description, and understanding Report rich narrative Researcher interacts with subjects Participants\n\nModified from Streubert & Carpenter (1995, p. 12).\n\nHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The history of theory development and theoretical thinking in nursing began with the writings of Florence Nightingale and continues to the present. This section highlights significant events in this history. Florence Nightingale Nightingale’s (1859/1992) Notes on Nursing presents the first nursing theory that focuses on the manipulation of the environment for the benefit of the patient. Although Nightingale did not present her work as a “nursing theory,” it has directed nursing practice for over 150 years. The Columbia School—The 1950s In the 1950s the need to prepare nurses at the graduate level for administrative and faculty positions was recognized. Columbia University’s Teachers College developed graduate education programs to meet these functional needs. The first theoretical conceptualizations of nursing science came from graduates of these programs. These nurse theorists include Peplau (1952/1988), Henderson (Harmer & Henderson, 1955), Hall (1959), and Abdellah (Abdellah, Beland, Martin, & Metheney, 1960). Theorists of this decade operated from a biomedical model that focused primarily on what nurses do, that is, their functional roles. They considered patient problems and needs to be the practice focus. Independent of the Columbia theorists, Johnson (at the University of California at Los Angeles) suggested that nursing knowledge is based on a theory of nursing diagnosis that is different from medical diagnosis (Meleis, 2007). The Yale School—The 1960s In the 1960s the focus of theoretical thinking in nursing moved from a problem/need and functional role focus to the relationship between the nurse and the patient. The Yale\n\n21\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nSchool’s theoretical position was influenced by the Columbia Teacher’s College graduates who became faculty members there (Henderson, 1960, 1966; Orlando, 1961/1990; Wiedenbach, 1964, 1969). Theorists of the Yale School view nursing as a process rather than an end in itself. Their theories look at how nurses do what they do and how the patient perceives his situation. Theorists of this school include Henderson, Orlando, and Wiedenbach. Independent of the Yale School, Levine (1967) presented her four conservation principles of nursing. In 1967, Yale faculty Dickoff, James, and Wiedenbach (two philosophers and a nurse, respectively) presented a definition of nursing theory and goals for theory development in nursing. Their paper was published in Nursing Research a year later and has become a classic document in the history of theoretical thinking in nursing (Dickoff, James, & Wiedenbach, 1968). Also in this decade, Joyce Travelbee presented her Human-to-Human Relationship Theory in her book Interpersonal Aspects of Nursing (1966, 1971). This theory extended the interpersonal relationship theories of Peplau and Orlando. Travelbee emphasized caring, empathy, sympathy, and the emotional aspects of nursing. It is important to note that in 1965 the American Nurses Association published a position paper on nursing education. This document changed the landscape of nursing education forever by recommending two levels of education for nursing: the professional nurse educated at the baccalaureate level and the technical nurse educated at the associate degree level. It was during this decade that federal monies were made available for doctoral study for nurse educators. The resulting doctorally prepared individuals became the next wave of nurse theorists. Table 2 lists the theorists of this decade and their publications. The 1970s The 1970s was the decade in which many nursing theories were first presented. Most of these theories have been revised since their original presentations. It is of note to mention that as of the mid-1970s, the National League for Nursing (NLN) required schools of nursing to select, develop, and implement a conceptual framework for the curricula as an accreditation standard. This requirement focused theoretical thinking on the application of theory to nursing education. In 1978, the first edition of Advances in Nursing Science was published. This journal focuses on nursing science, including the construction, analysis, and application of TABLE 2 Nursing Theories of the 1960s Theorist\n\nYear\n\nV. Henderson\n\n1960 1966 1961\n\nI. J.

Advances in Nursing Science quickly provided a forum for discussion and debate about theoretical thinking in nursing. Table 3 lists the theoretical publications of this decade. The 1980s In the 1980s, many nursing theories were revised based on research findings that expanded them. In addition, the works of Johnson, Benner, Parse, Leininger, Meleis, Pender, Riehl-Sisca, and Erickson, Tomlin, and Swain were added to the body of theoretical thought in nursing. The theoretical publications of the 1980s are presented in Table 4. The 1990s In the 1990s, research studies to test and expand nursing theory were numerous. Nursing Science Quarterly (edited by Rosemarie Rizzo Parse and published by Chestnut House, 1988–1998, and Sage, 1999–present) is devoted exclusively to the presentation of theory-based research findings and theoretical topics. Rogers published “Nursing: A Science of Unitary, Irreducible, Human Beings: Update 1990 (in Visions of Rogers’ Science-Based Nursing, edited by Barrett), her final refinement of her theory. Barrett’s text contains 24 additional chapters about Rogers’s theory and its implications for practice, research, education, and the future. In 1992, Parse changed the language of her theory from “man-living-health” to the theory of “human becoming.” She explained that the reason for the change was that contemporary dictionary definitions of “man” tend to be gender based as opposed to meaning humankind. The assumptions and principles of the theory remained the same; only the language was new. In 1998, Parse published The Human Becoming School of Thought—A Perspective for Nurses and Other Health Professionals. In 1993, Boykin and Schoenhofer published their theory of Nursing as Caring. They presented this theory as a grand theory, with caring as a moral imperative for nursing. The 1990s were marked by the proliferation of middle range theories to guide nursing practice. The circle of theory-research-practice provides the base for evidence-based practice and best practices in clinical nursing.

Kolcaba published a concept analysis of comfort with her husband (Kolcaba & Kolcaba, 1991), diagrammed the aspects of comfort (1991), operationalized comfort as an outcome of care (1992), presented the middle-range theory of comfort (1994), and tested the theory in an intervention study (Kolcaba & Fox, 1999). Mercer’s theory of maternal role attainment (1995) is a middle range theory based on her extensive research about mothers, fathers, infants, and parenting. From the mid-1990s to the present, theorists have published both commentaries about and revisions of their theories. Selected publications are reflected in Table 5. The Future In the early part of the 21st century, nursing theory is characterized by diversity. After decades of struggling with questions about how and what theories could or should guide the discipline of nursing, diversity of theoretical thought is now both accepted and embraced. As the discipline of nursing focuses on humans, health and illness, interactions, caring, relationships, therapeutics, environmental factors, and ethics, pluralism and diversity are both warranted and appropriate. This pluralism has provided a fertile ground for the development of middle range theories that guide research and evidence-based practice. In 1992, Meleis predicted that six characteristics of the discipline of nursing would direct theory development in the 21st century. These predictions, which follow, are still valid today: 1. The discipline of nursing is the human science underlying the discipline that “is predicated on understanding the meanings of daily lived experiences as they are perceived by the members or the participants of the science” (p. 112). 2. Increased emphasis on practice-orientation. 3. Nursing’s mission is to develop theories to empower nurses, the discipline, and clients. 4. “Acceptance of the fact that women may have different strategies and approaches to knowledge development than men” (p. 113). 5. Nursing’s attempt to “understand consumers’ experiences for the purpose of empowering them to receive optimum care and to maintain optimum health” (p. 114). 6. “The effort to broaden nursing’s perspective which includes efforts to understand the practice of nursing in third world countries” (p. 114). Contemporary nursing literature supports the validity of these predictions. Writing almost a decade later, Liehr and Smith (1999) describe and analyze a decade of middle range theory products that establish the foundation for the new millennium. They state that the current context urges a focus on the human development potential of health and healing and supports a nursing knowledge base that synthesizes art and science as well as practice and research. Research Many contemporary authors state that qualitative and quantitative research are equally essential for the development of the discipline of nursing. Theories involved in this research may be single-domain theories that describe, explain, or predict a phenomenon within a specific descriptive and explanatory context, or they may be prescriptive. Prescriptive theories reflect guidelines for caregivers and for providing appropriate actions.\n\n25\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory TABLE 5 Nursing Theory, 1990–2007 Theorist\n\nYear\n\nTitle 1990–1999\n\nM.

(with C. L. Murdaugh & M. A. Parsons)\n\nANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THEORY Smith (2003) states, “Evaluation is one of the most popular indoor sports of the organizations in which we live” (p. 190). She advocates that theories should be evaluated with the aspects of appreciation, recognition, and affirmation balanced with the identification of any theoretical weaknesses. She reminds us that nursing scholars who contribute to the development of nursing science are innovative pioneers who courageously offer their ideas for the advancement of the discipline. She cautions that the evaluator must be a responsible steward of the discipline with an obligation to care about the nature of evolution of nursing knowledge. Review of the Literature on Theory Analysis and Evaluation Parse (1997b, 2005) proposes a design for critical appraisal that is appropriate for all frameworks and theories and is comprised of structure and process. Structure criteria refer to the historical evolution of the theory, the foundational elements (assumptions and concepts), and relational statements (principles created from the concepts into humanuniverse-health process written at an abstract level). The process criteria include correspondence (semantic integrity and simplicity), coherence (syntax and aesthetics), and pragmatics. Syntax is recognized by the precision and logical flow with which ideas are presented. Aesthetics is recognized by the beauty of the presentation of theory, that is, the symmetry and harmony of the elements. Pragmatics refers to effectiveness and heuristic potential. Effectiveness is recognized by the way the theory is used as a guide to research and practice. Heuristic potential refers to the possibilities for inquiry. Barnum (1998) proposes analytic criteria of content, process, context, and goals. Her evaluative criteria of internal criticism include clarity, consistency, adequacy, logical\n\n27\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\ndevelopment, and level of theory development. Her criteria for external evaluation include reality convergence, utility, significance, discrimination, scope of theory, and complexity. Smith (2003) proposes a structure for the evaluation of middle range theories that includes consideration of the theory’s substantive foundations, structural integrity, and functional adequacy. Functional adequacy speaks specifically to application to practice, research, and generalizability. Chinn and Kramer (2004) describe theory in terms of purpose, concepts, definitions, relationships, structure, and assumptions. They offer a pragmatic guide to critical reflection of theory. They suggest that one should consider the following five criteria: clarity, simplicity, generality, accessibility, and importance. Fawcett (2005a) describes the analysis of conceptual models of nursing as the objective and systematic way of examining the origin, focus, and content of a theory without evaluating or making subjective value judgments about the theory. In her guidelines for analysis, the following areas are addressed: origins of the model, focus of the model, and content of the model. She provides questions to be answered for each of the areas. Fawcett states that evaluation of a nursing model is accomplished by comparing its content with the following criteria: significance, internal consistency, parsimony, testability, empirical adequacy, and pragmatic adequacy. As with the areas for analysis, Fawcett provides specific questions to be answered for each area of evaluation. The questions for testability and empirical adequacy differ for grand theories and middle range theories (Fawcett, 2005b). Johnson and Webber (2005) propose a criterion-based critique model for nursing theories that contains the following elements: Phase I—Intent of the Theory Criterion 1: The meaning is clear and understandable. Criterion 2: Boundaries are consistent with nursing practice. Criterion 3: Language is understandable and includes minimal jargon. Phase II—Concepts and Propositions Criterion 4: Major concepts are identified and defined. Criterion 5: Concepts stimulate the formulation of propositions. Criterion 6: Variables and assumptions help understand and interpret propositions. Phase III—Usefulness in Nursing Practice Criterion 7: Theoretical knowledge helps explain and predict phenomena. Criterion 8: Theoretical knowledge influences nursing practice. (p. 207) Parker (2006) states that readers should look carefully at the theory, read the theory as presented by the theorist, and read what others have written about the theory. She cautions readers to study the whole theory, as the parts will not be fully meaningful and may lead to misunderstanding (p. 20). Meleis (2007) suggests a model that defines theory evaluation as encompassing description, analysis, critique, testing, and support. This model also includes a unique aspect that she calls the “circle of contagiousness of a theory.” This concept refers to the popularity of usage of the theory to guide nursing practice and research. Guidelines for This Text For the purposes of this text, theories will be critiqued using a synthesis of the analysis and evaluation frameworks of Barnum (1998), Chinn and Kramer (2004), Johnson and\n\n28\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nWebber (2005), Fawcett (2005a, 2005b), and Meleis (2007). Critique, by definition, is the art of analyzing or evaluating a work of art or literature (Webster’s, 1991). It is assumed that there are both objective and subjective elements to the process of critiquing. Currently, case management and integrated health care systems focus on the bottom line, or the profit that can be realized from health care delivery. The system expects favorable outcomes to be delivered in increasingly shorter time frames in order to reduce costs. Advanced practice nurses are being utilized in many settings, and nurse practitioner programs have grown rapidly. While this situation has put the discipline of nursing solidly into all realms of care as a primary provider of service, this focus has diverted attention away from nursing knowledge and toward biomedical knowledge as the base for nursing practice (Fawcett, 1997). In order to analyze and evaluate nursing theory in the 21st century, it seems appropriate to use the best elements of the traditional academic sense of critique. It is hoped that this synthesis of methods provides the best practices of academic critique while retaining the idea that nursing theory is the base for professional nursing practice.\n\nQUESTIONS FOR CRITIQUE OF A NURSING THEORY 1. What is the historical context of the theory? This first question requires the reader to look carefully at the assumptions upon which the theory is built. Are the assumptions based on a specific philosophy and/or another theory—from nursing or a related discipline? Does one need additional study or information to understand the assumptions? Where does this theory fit in the history of nursing theory? Can it be identified as belonging within the totality or simultaneity paradigm, or does it rest on a different metaparadigm entirely? 2. What are the basic concepts and relationships presented by the theory? Are the concepts of the theory defined and used in a consistent fashion? Are the relationships presented logically and based upon the stated assumptions? Are the concepts and relationships clear and understandable to the reader? 3. What major phenomena of concern to nursing are presented? These phenomena may include but are not limited to human beings, environment, health, interpersonal relations, caring, goal attainment, adaptation, and energy fields. Current literature in nursing theory suggests the presence of more than the “original” four metaparadigm concepts of man, health, environment, and nursing. A theory need not address all of the major phenomenon of concern to nursing, but for the purpose of critique it is important to identify those phenomena that are addressed by the theory. 4. To whom does this theory apply? In what situations? In what ways? What is the scope of the theory? Does it apply to all recipients of nursing care in all possible situations? If not, to whom, and where will the theory have meaning? Does the theory describe, explain, or predict phenomena? 5. By what method or methods can this theory be tested? Can the concepts and relationships of this theory be observed, measured, and tested using qualitative or quantitative methods? Has testing of this theory occurred? What findings have been presented in the literature? 6. Does this theory direct nursing actions that lead to favorable outcomes? Does the research conducted about theory-directed practice demonstrate favorable client outcomes? With what frequency? In what situations? 7. How contagious is this theory? Who is using this theory? In what context? Is this theory directing nursing practice, nursing education, and/or nursing administration?\n\n29\n\nAn Introduction to Nursing Theory\n\nSummary Nursing science provides the basis for professional nursing practice. Nursing theories provide the critical thinking structures to direct the clinical decision-making process of professional nursing practice. The relationship between theory, research, and practice is circular in nature. As new knowledge and discoveries emerge in each of these realms, the cutting edge of the art and science of the discipline of nursing evolves.\n\nTheory development began with Nightingale and was revived in the 1950s. Theory development has been described from the historical context as well as the current state-of-the-art of theory development at the start of the new millennium. A framework for the critique of a theory has been presented and will be used throughout this text for the theories presented.\n\nEXPLORE MyNursingKit is your one stop for online chapter review materials and resources.
