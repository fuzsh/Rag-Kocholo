I owe him a debt of gratitude for his encouragement to pursue my investigations on fascism and for his comments on pieces that I wrote on the topic. For their unﬂinching support for this project, practically since its inception, I am also most grateful to Noël M. Valis and David T. Gies. Long in the making, these topographies of fascism have been written in Spain, Germany, and the United States. In Spain, José Luis Oyón and Carlos Sambricio provided me with substantial information on urban studies, fascist urban planning, and Falangist architecture. With Joan Gabriel López Guix I met often to talk about modern anti-Semitism. I would like to thank Facundo Tomás for his frank and judicious assessment of some of my ideas, Enric Ucelay-Da Cal for the very useful information he gave me concerning Spain’s presence in Morocco, Enric Cucurella for encouraging me to delve further into the modern philosophical reﬂections on war and their connection with art and literature, Albert Freixa for always ﬁnding time to discuss right-wing politics, and Gonzalo Pontón Gijón (he knows why). In Germany, I felt warmly welcomed by colleagues and friends alike, most particularly Andrea and Wolfram Domke, Luis Muñiz, and Anastasia Telaak. Bernhard König, whose vast knowledge and savoir vivre is matched only by his generosity, was instrumental in making possible a three-month stay in Germany. José Antonio Barbón and Diana Auad offered me their house in Königswinter, their beautiful garden, their impressive library, their assistance, and their unconditional friendship; in their company I spent an unforgettable summer. In the United States, my sincerest gratitude goes to Michael Papio, Carlos Ramos, Enric Bou, Christina Karageorgou-Bastea, Fanny Rothschild, Travis Landry, Justin\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nCrumbaugh, John Wade, Steven E. Silvern, Suzanne H. Petersen, Rosa J. Bird, Alexander Hollmann, and Jean-Louis Pautrot. José Madiedo has spent many hours working on the illustrations; without him, this book would have none. I also wish to thank the two external anonymous readers of the manuscript for their meticulous reading, their judicious comments, and their extremely useful recommendations. I cannot forget the many ways in which the chair of my department, Anthony C. Daly, S.J. (with whom I have spent countless hours arguing about evil), has helped me; in him I have found nothing but friendship, understanding, and the fullest support. I had the privilege to present my ideas as guest speaker at Yale University, Vanderbilt University, Brown University, and the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán. I am deeply grateful to my hosts for their kind invitation, and to the learned audiences of these institutions for their questions and remarks. I would like to acknowledge the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Program for Cultural Cooperation between Spain’s Ministry of Culture and United States’ Universities, and the Mellon Faculty Development Grants for their generous funding of the research that I conducted in Europe. I am also very grateful to Saint Louis University for providing ﬁnancial support for my project. Previous and revised versions of several sections contained in this book have appeared in journals or essay collections: “Habitus, Heterotopia and Endocolonialism in Early Spanish Literary Fascism,” in Studies in Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Literature 33, no. 2 (2009): 248–74; “Mirada cartográﬁca y voluntadde-arquitectura en la obra fascista de Ernesto Giménez Caballero,” in Bulletin of Spanish Studies 84, no. 3 (2007): 325–47; “Cartografía crítica del fascismo español: Checas de Madrid de Tomás Borrás,” in Res publica 13–14 (2004): 181–98; and “El fascista y la ciudad,” which appeared as a chapter of Madrid, de Fortunata a la M-40: Literatura y cultura urbanas, edited by Edward Baker and Malcolm Compitello (Madrid: Alianza, 2003), 197–237. I thank their publishers and editors for allowing me to publish here substantially revised material from those works. I was in the process of completing the book when my father passed away. He was not thrilled with my idea of writing on Spanish fascists: he knew them. Running for shelter in Barcelona during the aerial bombings routinely conducted by Italian squadrons and growing up in the early years of the Franco regime must have been on his mind when I told him about my research. I want to think that he would not disapprove of its outcome.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nBeing with someone who talks and writes about fascism is not always fun or easy. Marisol Barbón has never complained about that. Although her scholarly interests – colonial Peru – could hardly be further removed from mine, Marisol has devoted much of her time to my worries. She scrutinized every single draft of each chapter, and she made recommendations on the theoretical framework of the book. Conversations on European fascism and cultural geography have been, for a long time, the order of the day. I simply cannot imagine these topographies of fascism without her loving presence.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nNote on Translations and Quoted Material\n\nAll translations of texts originally written in Spanish, French, Italian, and German are my own, except where otherwise noted.

Even though about 80% of those objects already had been taken away by the spring of 2010, the Ministry of Defence had yet to revise the names of buildings and sites belonging to the armed forces. A case in point is the name of the barracks of the Legion in Melilla: “Acuartelamiento Millán Astray.” The barracks equestrian statue of Franco, the last of its kind to remain after the authorities of Santander had ﬁnally implemented the law by taking away the city’s statue of Franco in 2008, would not be removed until August 2010. In addition to the places and spaces related in one way or the other to the armed forces, traces of fascism and the Franco regime are still everywhere to be seen on Spain’s streets, squares, and buildings.2 Stubborn, pervasive, deeply rooted in certain strata of Spanish society and in the main conservative party, the Partido Popular (PP), the resistance against the erasure of these traces inscribed on space perpetuates and validates an authoritarian, and to a certain extent fascist, regime beyond its demise in 1977. In 2006, there were in Madrid no fewer than 350 streets with Francoist names. In 2009, the city hall of Gran Canaria changed the names of the streets “José Antonio Primo de Rivera,” “General Millán Astray,” and “General Queipo de Llano,” among others. As\n\n4\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nlate as 2011 – that is, thirty-six years after Franco’s death – Valladolid still has an unabashed Francoist atmosphere. About 360 facades of buildings displaying the Falangist yoke and arrows, neighbourhoods called “18 de Julio” or “Girón,” and streets bearing names such as “Primo de Rivera,” punctuate the urban space; their presence thus provides a fascist and Francoist meaning to Valladolid and frames the daily life of its citizens, whose acting out of the urban grammar highlights and sanctions, whether they like it or not, this anti-democratic ideology stamped on the urban landscape. There are many more cases, some of them disturbing indeed. As I write these introductory pages in November 2011, there presides over a square in downtown Granada a monolith in honour of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, co-founder of the fascist party Falange Española.3 Controlled by the Partido Popular, the city hall has refused to remove this statue on account of its alleged artistic value. But perhaps the most notorious instance of the survival of Francoism in space is the Valle de los Caídos, this most blatant of fascist monuments in whose crypt the Benedictine monks who administer this basilica and memorial celebrate mass with mention of the “brother Francisco [Franco].” In its Article 16, the Law of Historical Memory establishes (1) that the Valle de los Caídos will be governed with the norms that apply to places of worship and public cemeteries, and (2) that all political events and activities exalting the civil war, its protagonists, and Francoism be prohibited. Despite these provisions, in the session of the senate on 22 September 2010, the PP was the only party to vote against a motion urging the government to implement the provisions of the Law of Historical Memory on the Valle de los Caídos. Such resistance to remove the symbols of fascism and the Franco regime that are engraved on physical space correlates with the wish to hide, to leave buried the deadly result of the systematic repression carried out by the victors of the civil war. According to the most reliable sources, between 1936 and 1945 there were about 130,000 “judicial” killings and ﬁfty thousand murders without the slightest pretence of a trial (Preston, Spanish Civil War 302). Thousands of unidentiﬁed bodies lie in approximately 1,800 collective common graves across Spain. While the families of the victims and the Associations for the Recovery of Historical Memory periodically request help in locating the remains of relatives, the government has hitherto done little, if anything at all, to provide them with adequate resources. The situation described by Preston in 2007 has changed little in the past four years: “There is still no nationwide census of the dead, no team of historians working on the problem, no funds for DNA testing” (305). To do all this would amount to invoking the dead,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nto bringing them back to social life, to conjuring up the spectres and thereby recovering the repressed. In order to keep the fascist and Francoist symbols in place, as well as the names of streets, it is necessary to hinder the exhumation of the remains of the disappeared, that is, of the victims of those whose names still decorate Spain’s physical space. The invocation of the spectre would bring out the hidden meaning of those names or symbols, it would liberate what has been repressed, it would clean up, as it were, the dust covering monuments like the monolith in downtown Granada honouring Primo de Rivera. The opposition to invoking the spectre explains in part the vicious reaction against Judge Baltasar Garzón, an investigating magistrate at the National Court in Madrid who on 16 October 2008 opened an investigation into crimes against humanity carried out by the Franco regime between 1936 and 1951. Garzón attributed to General Francisco Franco and thirty-four chiefs of the military rebellion of 17 July 1936 the organization of a systematic plan to exterminate their political enemies and a massive repression.4 Among other things, the judge’s decision called for the formation of a group of experts to determine the number, location, and identity of the victims murdered during that period, and authorized nineteen exhumations. Not surprisingly, Garzón’s decision stirred a huge political, social, and juridical controversy. The ofﬁce of the National Court’s district attorney did not take long to appeal the decision. On 28 November 2008 the National Court’s Civil Division decreed that Garzón lacked jurisdiction to investigate the disappearances. A few months later, Spain’s Supreme Court granted the far-right union Manos Limpias, the rightist organization Libertad e Identidad, and the fascist party Falange Española de las JONS leave to ﬁle a lawsuit against Judge Baltasar Garzón on charges of distorting the law. After a highly politicized investigation of the case, on 12 May 2010 the Supreme Court’s examining magistrate allowed the indictment of Judge Garzón to proceed. As a result, the General Council of the Judicial Power temporarily suspended the judge from ofﬁce. On 7 September 2010 the Supreme Court validated the case against Garzón. Regardless of the judicial complexities and interpretations of this case, what matters here is that one of the main causes that prompted individuals, far-right organizations, and a fascist party to act against Garzón was the need literally to keep an unsavory past underground, to conceal the image of an insidious presence, to hold the spectre at bay. The trace of Francoism and fascism in contemporary Spain consists therefore of a game of visibilities and invisibilities played out in social\n\n6\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nspace. Although this phenomenon is not exclusive to fascist or far-right politics, it is consistent with the widespread interest that fascist politicians and intellectuals have always displayed for everything concerning space. The re-articulation of the nation and the body social under the guiding principle of organicism along with the structuring of the citizenry as an integral “people’s community”; the tacit view of the state as a building; territorial expansionism; the undertaking of public works; the designing of plans to change the urban landscape; or the relevance given to architecture are but some of the most familiar indicators of the fascists’ preoccupation with things spatial. The observation of these and related phenomena led me to formulate the ﬁrst proposition of this book on the topographies of fascism in Spain: A proper understanding of fascism requires a proper understanding of how the fascists conceived of, used, and produced space. Indeed, in fascist studies space has not been given its due. For the most part, space has been put aside in the interpretations of the nature of generic fascism and in general works on the topic,5 in the comparative approaches to and histories of European fascism,6 and in the histories and analyses of speciﬁc national fascisms.7 Only in the works devoted to fascist architecture, urban planning,8 and to public spectacles and rituals (e.g., political rallies, commemoration ceremonies, holiday festivities, parades)9 do we get a glimpse of the fascists’ deep, pervasive, all-encompassing interest in space. Such critical preference and the generalized absence of a theoretical reﬂection on space have taken us one step forward and two steps backward: one step forward because our knowledge of fascism has been reﬁned by the detailed studies of the centrality of rituals, geopolitics, architecture, and urban planning in fascism, and two steps backward because by treating atheoretically topics whose importance has been universally acknowledged, such scholarly works have consolidated a limited view of a multilayered phenomenon, precluding or at least making it difﬁcult to conceive of space, in the context of fascism, as something more than buildings, roads, the urban landscape, or the occupation of foreign lands. In the otherwise vast ﬁeld of fascist studies, there is thus something missing: a comprehensive exploration of the fascists’ views, politics, and production of space. At the same time, in fascist studies the concept of space has been taken for granted. Tacitly, most scholarly works on spatial issues in fascism have embraced without any further scrutiny the otherwise predominant view of space in modern parlance as well as in most scholarship practised in the social sciences and the\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nhumanities: following a tradition born with Newton’s theory of absolute space, space is considered as a container, a ﬁeld, a universal receptacle of human agency and social action, in short, as a thing in itself. My initial proposition was soon followed by a second one: in order to elaborate and prove the former, it is essential to put aside the strongly entrenched concept of space as receptacle and apply in its stead a theoretical model built upon the recognition of the coexistence of different views (absolute and relative), categories (physical, mathematical, social, phenomenological, geographical, and the like), and dimensions (material, conceptual, experiential) of space. Fortunately, there is no lack of scholarship proposing alternative theoretical models and analytical approaches. A number of cultural geographers, philosophers, sociologists, anthropologists, and historians have demonstrated that space should not be reduced to its absolute form or to its physicality. Thanks to the works of Gaston Bachelard, Michel de Certeau, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault (Dits; Punir), David Harvey (Condition; Cosmopolitanism; Spaces; Urban), Henri Lefebvre (Production; State; Writings), Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Neil Smith, Edward W. Soja (Postmodern; Thirdspace), and Yi-Fu Tuan – to quote only some of the most inﬂuential – there is today a burgeoning ﬁeld of spatial studies.10 Although their reception in the social sciences and the humanities has been disparate (with some exceptions, historians and literary historians have been less receptive, for instance, than specialists in the disciplines of architecture and urban planning), these scholars and thinkers have provided us with theoretical models and analytical tools for the study of space in all its diversity, complexity, and multiple layers. My third proposition, which underpins the analytical component of this book, condenses some fundamental presuppositions that underlie several of the above-mentioned works: Space is both a product of social action and a determinant of human agency. Of the different available theoretical models, I have adopted, or to be more precise, adapted as the theoretical basis of my book, the most complete of them all. I am referring to the one put forth by Henri Lefebvre in his path-breaking and extremely inﬂuential La Production de l’espace.11 Lefebvre, who has coined the expression production of space, argues for a unitary “science of space” that encompasses the physical, the mental, and the social. Concerned with “the logico-epistemological space, the space of social practice, [and] the space occupied by sensory phenomena” (Production 11–12), he puts forward two propositions: (1) space is a social product, and (2) new social relationships call for a new space, and vice versa. Hence each society has its own space. As he writes elsewhere,\n\n8\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\n“There is a production of space inherent to the mode of production, and … this cannot be deﬁned solely by class relations … or by ideologies and forms of knowledge and culture … but is also deﬁned by this speciﬁc production” (State 234). Lefebvre proposes a spatial triad to study space in all its dimensions: spatial practice, representation of space, and space of representation (Production 33, 38–9): 1 Spatial practice embraces the production process and the reproduction of social relations of production while ensuring continuity and cohesion. This concept describes the physical, non-linguistic space in which ﬂows of goods, human ﬂuxes, personal activities and interpersonal relationships, exchanges, and the like occur. It refers to the world of the sensory perceptions and human actions. People live space through their senses. Their experience of space is deﬁned and determined by prohibitions and permissions, transportation and communication systems, the relations between the country and the city, social networks, the laws regulating the property of the land, the state or the local administration of the territory, the articulation of the social and the private, and so forth. Considering the dynamics and nature of spatial practices, it follows that individuals have both a spatial competence (i.e., the acquired knowledge of the rules governing social space) and a spatial performance (i.e., the ability to properly use said space). 2 Representation of space is conceptualized space “established from objective, practical, and scientiﬁc elements” (State 229). Tied to “the relations of production and to the ‘order’ which those relations impose” (Production 33), representations of space encompass the signs, codes, knowledge, and language that enable us to understand, represent, and talk about spatial practices. This is the space of the engineers, geographers, cartographers, scientists, urban planners, mathematicians, philosophers, and technocrats. Representations of space are abstract: think, for instance, of Newton’s theory of space, Euclidean geometry, Einstein’s theories of relativity, or Plato’s, Aristotle’s, Descartes’s, and Kant’s conceptions of space. This said, they have a practical impact and “intervene in and modify spatial textures which are informed by effective knowledge and ideology” (42). 3 Space of representation (a translation of the French espace de représentation better than the one offered in the standing English translation: representational space) is the space lived directly through its associated\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nimages and symbols. This kind of space “overlays physical space, making symbolic use of its objects” (Production 39). For Lefebvre, “the only products of spaces of representation are symbolic works” (42). Utopias, paintings, landscapes described in literature, poems, and spaces of ritual are instances of spaces of representations. Lefebvre relates this space to “the clandestine or underground side of social art as also to art” (33; see also 224, 232). Therefore, spaces of representation, which, unlike the representations of spaces, do not need to obey rules of coherence or consistency, can be described, in Harvey’s words, as mental inventions “that imagine new meanings or possibilities for spatial practices” (Condition 218–19).12 The three spaces are connected dialectically, but they do not necessarily constitute a coherent whole. Each space contributes “in different ways to the production of space according to their qualities and attributes, according to the society or mode of production in question, and according to the historical period” (Production 46). In addition, the distinctions between the three dimensions, particularly between the representations of space and the spaces of representation, are not always clear, as Lefebvre himself avows. For instance, he contends that “today’s practitioners have worked either for one side of it or the other, some developing spaces of representation and the remainder working out representations of space” (43); as an example, Lefebvre contrasts Frank Lloyd Wright’s endorsement of a communitarian space with Le Corbusier’s intellectualization of space (43). Sometimes, what truly matters are the gaps that separate those dimensions: thus, the work of artistic creation “occupies the interstices between representations of space and spaces of representation” (43). I argue that fascism attempted to produce a fascist space at the three levels established by Lefebvre. Hence my fourth proposition: The new social, cultural, economic, and political concepts and relationships brought about by the fascists implied new representations of space, new spaces of representations, and, once the fascists were in power, new material spatial practices.13 Naturally, the demise of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in 1945 halted à jamais the ongoing transformation of space in these two countries. Furthermore, for a Marxist like Lefebvre it would be hard, if not impossible, to conceive of a “fascist production of space,” for fascism did not bring an end to the capitalist mode of production. But changes in the social fabric need not be driven solely by economics, as historians and sociologists have insisted since Max Weber. When we consider fascist ideas and actions, we have to\n\n10\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\ngive analytical preference to ideology, and most particularly habitus, for reasons that I hope will be clear throughout this book. Fascism did produce its own space. But it did not undertake such creation concurrently. The three spatial dimensions contributed differently to the fascists’ production of space, depending on the circumstances. Thus material spatial practices were developed only when fascism attained uncontested political power, while fascist representations of space and spaces of representation produced a fascist conceptual and imaginary space prior to the consolidation of spatial practices. At the same time, the direct action carried out by political agents and paramilitary groups and, for instance, the habitus of the legionnaires posted in the Spanish protectorate of Morocco indicate by themselves the existence of incipient fascist spatial practices before the fascists’ seizure of power. Any analysis of the production of space has to take into account the connections between the spatial practices, the representations of space, and the spaces of representation. Considering that production means here, obviously, “production carried out by human action,” human agency is at the core of the production of space. This is all the more evident in the speciﬁc case of the fascist production of space. As Paxton (Anatomy 15–23) and Mann (1–17) argue, fascism is better understood in terms of the actions performed by the fascists, for they saw politics “as unlimited activism to achieve moral absolutes” (Mann 8). In contrast to liberalism and Marxism, fascism lacks an elaborated philosophical system and political doctrine. Programs were vague and ﬂuid in the extreme. Benito Mussolini, who boasted about his lack of a speciﬁc political program, expounded his own fascist doctrine ten years after he seized power in a piece co-written with Giovanni Gentile, published in 1932. The National Socialists’ twenty-ﬁve-point political program, declared immutable at the party’s Bamberg Conference on 14 February 1926, is not a model of coherence and clarity. Neither José Antonio Primo de Rivera nor Onésimo Redondo nor Julio Ruiz de Alda nor any other prominent Spanish fascist leader bothered to write a book elaborating his fascist politics and world view. Mann is right when he claims that fascism was much more than a group of persons with certain beliefs: “Fascism had a great impact on the world only because of its collective actions and its organizational forms” (12–13). While fascist ideology must be taken seriously, it must be done by considering it on its own terms. The prominence of action in fascist ideology and political practice (e.g., street violence, paramilitarism, warmongering) is yet another proof of the need to approach fascism topographically.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nGiven the prominence of action in fascism, I have prioritized the habitus over the ideology of fascism. This methodological procedure seems more productive than the examination of a fascist mentality or ideology; in my opinion these two concepts are not precise enough by themselves to explain the fascist performance of space, the appearance of fascism before the emergence of a full-ﬂedged fascist political doctrine, or the presence of fascism in twenty-ﬁrst-century political and social arenas. Mentality is not very operative on account of its psychological reading of complex social processes irreducible to mental structures, while ideology is problematic because of the widespread tendency to reduce ideology to political ideology. Moreover, in contrast to the abstractedness inherent in ideology, the habitus is deeply connected to the body, to human agency, and to the production of space. Pierre Bourdieu deﬁnes the concept as an acquired system of “long-lasting (rather than permanent) schemes or schemata or structures of perception, conception and action” (“Habitus” 43) produced by the conditioning factors associated with a particular class of conditions of existence.14 By generating and organizing practices and representations, the habitus enables the production of individual and collective practices within the limits inherent in the speciﬁc conditions of such production. It is a net of acquired characteristics “which are the product of social conditions and which, for that reason, may be totally or partially common to people who have been the product of similar social conditions” (45). This habitus also can be modiﬁed through actions oriented by the individuals’ intentions and consciousness. These generative schemata mean the internalization of social structures. The habitus of individuals inform their practices. As Judith Butler notes in her otherwise critical view of Bourdieu’s concept, “The habitus is formed, but it is also formative” (Excitable 155). Performativity is thus at the core of the habitus. For this reason, the habitus should not be conceived of as an essence or as something previous to or independent from human agency. The production of discourse, itself a manifestation of a habitus, played a substantial role in fascism. The pivotal function in fascist politics of rhetoric, symbology, rituals, artworks, literary texts, and propaganda material has been repeatedly noted.15 Walter Benjamin famously referred to this phenomenon in his widely read piece on the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction. According to Benjamin, fascism sees its salvation in giving the masses an opportunity to express themselves, but without modifying the property relations that those masses want to eliminate. By so doing, fascism introduces aesthetics into political life. In Benjamin’s own words, “The violation of the masses, whom fascism, with\n\n12\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nits Führer cult, forces to their knees, has its counterpart in the violation of an apparatus which is pressed into the production of ritual values” (241). The culmination of these fascist efforts to aestheticize politics is, according to Benjamin, war (241–2). Seeking to mobilize the masses and impose a fascist habitus and ideology onto them, the fascists promoted an elaborated ritualism while disseminating discourse. In Mosse’s view, “Aesthetics shaped the fascist view of man, of his surroundings and of politics. It was a cement which held fascism together” (Fascist 52). Furthermore, cultural products were of paramount importance to fascists, not only as a means of propaganda, but also as a way of inserting violence into language. By performing violence through words, fascist discourse refracted the physical violence routinely carried out by fascists in physical space. In her cogent study of masculinity in Italian Fascism, Spackman deﬁnes fascism as a “discursive regime” in which the relation between language and events is one in which language itself functions “as one of the realities of force and violence” (xv). In short, fascist discourse performs violence. Fascism put into practice a symbolic violence that functioned in tandem with the violence performed by individuals or paramilitary groups within material spatial practices.16 Thus we may conclude that the violence inherent in the fascist habitus manifested itself through physical and symbolic actions that occurred across the three dimensions of the spatial triad alluded to earlier. Symbolic violence permeates fascist representations of space as well as spaces of representation. Fascist discourse was meant to express, shape, and impose a habitus onto others, to perform violence, and to contribute to the fascist production of space. Since the scholarship devoted to spatial issues in fascism has focused primarily on geopolitics, rituals, architecture, and urban planning, in this book the emphasis is placed on fascist written manifestations (e.g., essays, newspaper articles, political manifestos, novels, poetry) of representations of space and spaces of representation, without neglecting their relationship with material spatial practices. The centrality of discourse in fascist movements and regimes is all the more evident in the case of Spanish fascism after the civil war of 1936–9. Within the Franco regime, the fascists enjoyed control over material spatial practices only between the outset of the new regime and the 1950s. Those were the years of the disastrous economic autarchy and of Spain’s political isolation. Urban planners designed projects to alter the grammar of cities and towns across Spain after a fascist ideology, while architects built buildings and monuments based upon a fascist aesthetics. As of the early 1960s, though, the modernization of the industry, Spain’s\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\neconomic growth, tourism, the country’s integration in the networks of international capitalism, and the migration from the countryside to cities such as Barcelona and Madrid determined the urban planning as well as the articulation of space and spatial relationships across the country. The fascists’ attempts to transform physical space and intervene in the urban processes could not compete against capital.17 In contrast to fascism’s partial failure to control spatial practices and transform non-linguistic space in its image, Spanish fascists did succeed in developing a multifaceted discourse, born in the early 1920s, that moulded and taught a habitus to the citizens (particularly through the educational system), expressed a politics of space, and produced space according to the qualities and attributes of spaces of representation and representations of space. My approach to the fascist production of space in Spain is topographical, for we are dealing with a constellation of fascist “localities” and “representations” of places and spaces. Here I use the word topography in two different ways that correspond to the two clusters of meanings of the word. First of all, topography is “the science or practice of describing a place … the accurate and detailed delineation and description of any locality” (def. 1a) as well as “a detailed description or delineation of the features of a locality” (def. 1b). Second, the word is deﬁned as “localization, local distribution; the study of this” (def. 1c) and as “the features of a region or locality collectively” (def. 2). In the ﬁrst set of deﬁnitions, topography consists of the knowledge and writing about space; it is thus a representation. In the second, it refers to the features of physical space. Accordingly, by topographies of fascism I mean several things. On the one hand, it has to be read as “topographies” of “fascism,” that is, as the fascists’ knowledge and writing about space (e.g., works of art, literary products, building programs, treatises on urban planning), and as the features of the spaces and places that they themselves produced (e.g., roads, the urban landscape, the occupation and administration of foreign lands). On the other, the expression refers to my “topographies” of fascism, to my knowledge and writing about the “topographies” of “fascism” in the two meanings just mentioned – in short, to the production of my topographical discourse on fascist space. In order to provide a more focused and nuanced “topography” of fascism, I investigate a speciﬁc national actualization of the fascist politics and production of space: Spanish fascism from the late 1910s to the mid1950s. This is a territory that has been mapped unevenly.18 To be sure, historians, sociologists, and political scientists have produced important scholarly work, quoted throughout the book, on the history and charac-\n\n14\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nteristics of Spanish fascism. But few books have been written on Spanish literary fascism.19 To an extent, it could be said that this marginality refracts the extraterritoriality of Spanish fascism within fascist studies. Due to the fact that Spanish fascism is a peripheral, lesser-known phenomenon with respect to National Socialism and Italian Fascism, I frequently compare the fascist politics and production of space in Spain with their counterparts in Germany, Italy, and, to a lesser degree, France. Accordingly, I analyse the corpus of Spanish texts in relation to works by, among others, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Curzio Malaparte, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Robert Brasillach, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, Ernst Jünger, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer, and Joseph Goebbels. This book has therefore a comparative element. Still, there is another reason that has made it advisable to add a comparative dimension to my study of a speciﬁc case: the transnational nature of fascism. In the last twenty years, the most prominent scholars in the ﬁeld of fascist studies have argued for a theory of “generic fascism.” Instead of producing grand, all-encompassing theories of fascism – as had been the tendency in the past among scholars, especially those of Marxist persuasion – they have centred their attention on establishing a “fascist minimum,” that is to say, a set of characteristics common to all fascisms. Following the pioneering works of Juan Linz (“Some Notes”) and George L. Mosse (International Fascism), these scholars (historians, sociologists, and political scientists for the most part) study the manifold ways and different degrees by which generic fascism manifests in speciﬁc fascisms within the historical period that typically covers the interwar years.20 This is not to say that there are no signiﬁcant differences in their methodology and approach. Some proceed deductively. Thus Roger Grifﬁn starts with a theoretical model, in which fascism is conceived of as a genus of political ideology with a “mythic core” (characterized as a palingenetic form of populist ultra-nationalism). From this mythic core, Grifﬁn derives the traits of generic fascism (e.g., anti-liberalism, anti-conservatism, tendency to operate as a charismatic form of politics, anti-rationalism, link to totalitarianism, racism, eclecticism) (Grifﬁn, general introduction; Nature). Other scholars, in contrast, follow an inductive method. This is the case with Stanley G. Payne’s theory of generic fascism. Payne builds his theory upon a previous historical account of fascism in Europe between the two world wars (History 3–19, 441–95; “Fascism” 82–8). In his work, empirical observation and the analysis of speciﬁc cases of fascism lead to the determination and description of the characteristics of generic fascism, which Payne groups under three categories: the fascist\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nnegations (anti-liberalism, anti-communism, anti-conservatism), ideology and goals (creation of a new authoritarian state, corporativism, the goal of empire, espousal of an idealist and voluntarist creed), and style and organization (aesthetic structure of meetings, symbolism, and ritual; attempted mass mobilization with militarization of political relationships and style; positive evaluation of violence; stress on the masculine principle of male dominance; exaltation of youth; tendency towards an authoritarian, charismatic, personal leadership). Payne also distinguishes among six varieties of fascism, one of them being Spanish Falangism (“Concept” 14–25). But regardless of the evident differences among these and other scholars, what matters to us here is their development of a theory of generic fascism. In these topographies of fascism, Spanish fascism is understood as a variant of generic fascism. Here, the view of fascism as a genus of particular cases, and consequently, as a transnational phenomenon, is predicated on the notion that fascism is best understood from an antifoundationalist standpoint. Fascism lacks an essence, a deﬁning feature; it cannot be deﬁned in terms of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions; and a nominalist approach (e.g., Allardyce) is equally unsatisfactory. The things that we call “fascism” overlap and relate in different ways. One may even say that fascism is a family-resemblance concept: what holds it together is a complicated network of crisscrossing and overlapping similarities.21 The concept of generic fascism allows for the uncovering of the crisscrossing of similarities and the presence of differences among concrete instances of fascisms without losing sight of the fact that they all belong to the same family. The varieties of fascism need to be placed in conversation among themselves in order for the historian to determine their common ground, because the roots, ideology, habitus, aims, political doctrine, style, and evolution of fascism, as well as the main traits of the fascist movements (e.g., organizational structure, social composition, tactics to attain political power) and regimes (e.g., tactics and strategies of power) were shared in fundamental ways by all national realizations of fascism – the Spanish case, of course, included. Hence the importance of studying it within a comparative framework. As Iordachi points out, “the comparative method is indispensable in fascist studies … in order to capture the similarities and differences among historical examples of fascism” (“Comparative” 4). This is precisely one of the methodological presuppositions underlying this book. I have endeavoured to analyse in depth little-known texts (even in Spain) in both their national and international contexts.\n\n16\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nThis book, whose organizing principle is space rather than time, itself approaches history through the lens of space. With the exception of the ﬁrst chapter, each chapter is dedicated to several key places and spaces as represented and produced by the fascists at different or overlapping historical periods: Morocco in the ﬁrst three decades of the twentieth century (chapter 2), the spatial myths of Castile, Rome, and the empire as envisioned by the fascists from the late 1910s until the mid-1940s (chapter 3), the city in the Second Republic and the civil war (chapter 4); and lastly Russia in the 1940s and 1950s (chapter 5). Without neglecting causal relations, I propose to study the history of the fascist production of space geographically, through the analysis of patterns, spaces, and spatial relationships vis-à-vis their variations within the different durées or time spans of fascism. While keeping in mind Spanish fascism’s longue durée – a time span that reaches the present – my investigations have centred on the overlapping of two time spans: the conjunctural time span, which covers Spanish fascism from its beginnings until the beginning of the end of its hegemony in the Franco regime, and the short time span of, for example, the Rif War, the Blue Division’s Russian campaign, and the Nationalists’ victory parade in Madrid in 1939. The ﬁrst chapter is slightly different from the rest. While the remaining chapters centre on speciﬁc spaces, this one focuses on concepts of space as expressed in one generic instance of the spaces of representation and representations of space: fascist theoretical writing. It begins with a compact scrutiny of the fascist politics of space by contrasting the speciﬁc manner in which fascists in Spain, Germany, and Italy articulated three notions of space: the absolute, the relative, and the relational. The bulk of the chapter addresses the expression of this politics of space in three of the most inﬂuential fascist theoretical essays ever published in Spain: Genio de España (1932), Arte y Estado (1935), and Roma madre (1939), all written by Ernesto Giménez Caballero, one of the main ideologues of Spanish fascism in the 1930s. These books number among the most important manifestations of the fascist production of space through writing. Key elements are Giménez Caballero’s tendency to represent the political, artistic, and literary space as architecture; his spatialization of discourse (e.g., preference for simultaneity, collage, and visual literature); and his cartographic approach to political, historical, cultural, and economic issues. Indeed, Giménez Caballero considered Spain’s history as a “territory” deﬁned by its own genius loci, one that had to be “mapped” before it could be understood. This chapter may be characterized as a point of departure for the examination of the fascist\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nwriting related in one way or the other to the fascist politics and production of space. Chapter 2 is centred on the Spanish protectorate of Morocco (1912– 56). After relating Spanish colonialism to fascism and framing the former in its historical context, I argue that the Spanish fascist habitus was forged in Morocco during the Rif War (1921–7). Works by Tomás Borrás, Francisco Franco, Ernesto Giménez Caballero, José Millán Astray, Luys Santa Marina, and Rafael Sánchez Mazas shaped this habitus in relation to the production of a colonial space and to an authoritarian view of Spain that was no less inﬂuential than the military successes on the battleﬁeld, the creed and deeds of the Legion, and the administration of the protectorate itself. Published mostly in the 1920s, the texts studied in chapter 2 had a performative function: I claim that, in their own way, they made fascism. Particular emphasis has been placed in this second chapter on war writing and the role played by warfare in the production of space. Chapter 3 deals with the fascist reworking of three spatial myths that were of the utmost importance in Spanish fascism vis-à-vis the fascist habitus: Castile, Rome, and the empire – myths developed by a wide spectrum of fascists in journalistic articles, essays, books, poems, and novels. I consider Castile as the ur-topia of Spanish fascism and the point of departure for a new (fascist) production of space; Rome as the capital of Spanish fascism and the centre of a totalitarian production of space; and empire as both the control exerted over other countries and the colonial control of the state over its own citizens. Among other functions, within the fascist production of space the myths of Castile, Rome, and empire deﬁne and articulate the nation, insert the individual into a narrative presented as both original and constitutive, tint the nation with the intangibility and prestige of godlike essences superior to everything else, and impose a symbolic space that gives a ready-made meaning to the material spatial practices, thus restricting the individual’s capacity to produce his or her own space. Chapter 4 explores the fascist urban writing as materialized in spaces of representation, representations of space, and, to a lesser extent, material spatial practices in the context of the violent struggle for hegemony during the 1930s. The rhetoric of walking and of mapping, as articulated in the fascist spaces of representation, is the central twofold theme of this chapter. I examine the representation/production of the city (Madrid in particular) in a number of representative fascist novels and essays by, among other authors, Tomás Borrás, Agustín de Foxá, Rafael García Serrano, Ernesto Giménez Caballero, José-Vicente Puente, and Felipe Ximénez de Sandoval – all of\n\n18\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nwhich were produced during the civil war or in its aftermath. In this chapter I also take up the rhetoric of war literature that was discussed in chapter 2, along with the theories on urbanism and architecture connected to the fascist politics of space analysed in chapter 1. Factually as well as symbolically, the war consisted of the defence/conquest of a topography. After their victory over the Republic, the Nationalists “rewrote” Spain by imposing an authoritarian administration and culture. The last section, devoted to the 1939 victory parade in Madrid, explores the rewriting of urban space at the level of material spatial practices. Finally, chapter 5 analyses the memoirs, diaries, poems, novels, and short stories written by veterans of the Spanish expeditionary force, known in Spain as División Azul or the Blue Division, sent by the Franco regime to ﬁght as an autonomous unit of the Wehrmacht against the Soviet Union. I claim that the symbolic appropriation and conquest of space through writing is carried out from the experience of the spatial alienation felt by the fascist veterans disappointed with a regime that did not implement fascist policy. Another main focus lies in the consideration of a number of works as “spectral.” I hope to show that writing constitutes, in these cases, the house of the spectre. Both the spatial alienation and the spectre are correlated with the political metamorphoses of the Franco regime, which distanced itself from Germany when it became clear, in the winter of 1942–3, that Hitler would lose the war. The withdrawal of the Blue Division corresponded thus to a new direction in Franco’s foreign policy. To a certain extent, this was the beginning of the end of the fascists’ hegemony within the Franco regime itself. But the marginalization of Falange from the power structures would be contested from different camps and by different agents, among them by the spectre returning from the Soviet Union in the form of those Falangist veterans of the Russian campaign who felt betrayed by the government. The Blue Division culture would come to represent both the bad conscience of the political establishment and the public display of such spectrality. In a sense, Spanish fascism became a spectral and somewhat embarrassing presence after the Second World War. Thereafter, the history of fascism in Spain is a ghost story of sorts, an unﬁnished tale of spectres haunting the land. When I set out to design these topographies of fascism, I had to draw boundaries. A topographical approach to cultural phenomena may be deﬁned as the self-conscious drawing of provisional boundaries to an amorphous locus. Like produced space, maps and writing are bounded territories. The act of producing space entails the construction of meaning by bounding space, or else by rearranging the existing limits\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthat enclose a territory. Boundaries and meanings work hand in hand. “A boundary,” writes Martin Heidegger, “is not that at which something stops … the boundary is that from which something begins its presencing … Space is in essence that for which room has been made, that which is let into its bounds” (“Building” 154). Borders thus are unstable entities immersed in a constant process of negotiation. In my previous scholarly work, the reality of everyday life affected little, if at all, the stability of the limits that I had put on my object of study. Not this time, for fascism has never left us. Rather, it has adopted altered shapes; it has inﬁltrated the functioning of democracy; it is alive in social space; it is part of the habitus of many. Walking in certain streets of cities and towns across Spain while I was doing research for this book was a painful reminder of the pervasiveness of fascism in social space. Staying in and crossing spaces stamped by fascist and Francoist traces, as well as learning through the media about political statements, activities, and social events that one could easily relate to fascism added a most unwanted, if not altogether unexpected pressure to change the horizons that I had chosen for this book – a pressure for writing, for instance, a sixth chapter on, say, the “Traces of Fascism in Twentieth-First-Century Spain’s Social Space.” But then I concluded that altering the boundaries of the map would blur the image that I intended to portray, as when one stretches a picture on a computer’s desktop to make it ﬁt the screen. I had to resist the craving for totality. My map had to be something different: a tale pointing to the present, the picture of an old relative, the representation of a land uncannily similar to our own.\n\nChapter One\n\nA Politics of Space\n\nConcepts of Space A radical transformation of the social entails an equally radical modiﬁcation of the material spatial practices, the representations of space, and the spaces of representation that delimit, structure, and perform the territory in which the revolution has taken place. The passage from one mode of production to another, a coup d’état that replaces polities, even the appearance of certain means of communication (e.g., the Internet) dramatically alter the perceived, conceived, and lived space. In the context that concerns us here, any political project that aims at modifying the social in its entirety – and fascism was one of them – must unavoidably address spatial issues. Within this schema, a revolution incapable of producing its own space has failed to achieve its essential objective, for instead of changing life itself, “[it] has merely changed ideological superstructures, institutions or political apparatuses” (Lefebvre, Production 54). A true revolution, holds Lefebvre, “must manifest a creative capacity in its effects on daily life, on language and on space” (54). Transformative politics comes from combining the different dimensions of space anew.1 Since the state, itself a construed place,2 has as its main business the demarcation, control, and administration of a territory through a complex of institutions, it follows that a revolutionary political project that aspires to take over and transform the state must at least (1) redeﬁne and regulate the transport and system communications, the land uses, and the ﬂows of goods and money that shape, articulate, and give meaning to a politically organized territory; (2) modify the laws, institutions, institutional relationships, and social conventions cemented by a rationality and shared values; (3) determine the spaces of representation\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n21\n\nthat provide the codes and language that make the state and the national territory intelligible; and (4) affect as much as it can the mental inventions whereby individuals imagine the state and new possibilities for their experiential space. Hence, although revolutionary politics opens up new possibilities for space, thereby freeing places from old restraints and prohibitions, it also sets up the conditions of possibility for the new state’s use of that space as a means of social control.3 Fascism developed and openly expressed a self-conscious and multifaceted politics of space. To many people, precisely the outcome of such politics of space is what ﬁrst comes to mind when prompted to remember, imagine, or think about fascism. Countless documentaries, motion pictures, photographs, artworks, and printed material of all sorts devoted to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany have represented and/or analysed spaces and places considered as emblems of these regimes, thereby stamping on everyone an image of fascism that is closely associated with a particular production of space. Crowded assembly halls and open-air stadiums, neoclassical monumental buildings, streets adorned with fascist insignia taken over by rowdy and bullying Brown or Black Shirts, smoky Bavarian beer halls engulfed in a conspiratorial atmosphere, roads ﬁlled with terriﬁed civilians ﬂeeing their homes before advancing German troops, territories crossed by train convoys transporting herdedin Jews to their death, the Nazi concentrationary universe: these are just some of the most representative places and spaces of a list as long as it is grim. After watching documentaries like Claude Lanzmann’s Shoa (1985), with its unforgettable, disturbing portrayal of the railroad system so efﬁciently used by the administrators of the Holocaust, or the scene from Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator (1940) in which Adenoid Hinkel (Charlie Chaplin), dictator of Tomainia, plays with a large inﬂatable globe while dancing to the tune of Richard Wagner’s Lohengrin, we are left with the impression that both Lanzmann and Chaplin underscore one of fascism’s – to put it in metaphysical terms – “ﬁrst principles”: that of space.4 The obvious link of these and other fascist spaces and places with a Weltanschauung dominated by a passion for the absolute as well as with an authoritarian conception of the political and the social should not lead us, however, to conﬁne the fascist concept of space to one single way of understanding space and spatial relationships. Contrary to common belief, fascist ideology, political practices, social action, and cultural production show clearly that fascism held different concepts of space, at times intertwined, often overlapped, but always interconnected through a hierarchical relationship whose order changed, depending on the cir-\n\n22\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\ncumstances and political goals. As will be seen throughout this book, the fascist politics of space articulated different views of space. Using a model proposed by David Harvey, I will here differentiate between three ways of understanding space: absolute, relative, and relational.5 By absolute space, we will understand a “preexisting, immovable, continuous, and unchanging framework … within which distinctive objects can be clearly identiﬁed and events and processes accurately described” (Harvey, Cosmopolitanism 134). In absolute space, people, objects, and processes ﬁnd their identity, uniqueness, and meaning in terms of the ﬁxed location that they occupy (134). A product of a geometrization of space, absolute space is, in Lefebvre’s words, “the true space, the space of truth” (Production 236); it is located nowhere “because it embodies all places” (236), and it comprehends and determines “the entire existence of the group concerned” (240). Prohibitions, threats, even physical violence regulate the places, networks, movements, and relationships located within absolute space. In contrast to absolute space, relative space, associated with non-Euclidean geometry and most particularly Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity, is a function of movement and behaviour. For this reason, it is more appropriate to denominate it as relative space-time. In the relative space-time, the distance between places is measured in terms of the time needed to go from one location to the other. Individuals link places in different manners and with different purposes, thereby providing those places with a diversity of interconnections, meanings, and functions. The observer, who establishes perspectives and therefore redistributes spatial relationships and temporal distances, creates maps of relative places and measures distances. Finally, there is the Leibnizian view of space as relational. In Leibniz’s philosophy of space, distance, size, or shape matters less than situation. Opposing the concept of space as an absolute entity, Leibniz viewed space as the order of relations between coexistents, which unfold not as extended, but in extension. Instead of conceiving of them as inert bodies extended in space, Leibniz maintained that entities expand as one continuous whole. The nature of a body “consists in nothing but the dynamicon, or the innate principle of change and persistence” (Leibniz, Philosophical Essays 251). Subjects are diffusely located, and “the diffusion of place forms space” (Leibniz, Philosophical Papers 2: 1011). In essence, relational space has to do with performativity. Human and social processes produce their own space and time. In a certain way, they “do not exist in space-time” (Harvey, Cosmopolitanism 137). Instead, space and time are internalized within matter and process (137). Events and processes crystallize out of “a ﬁeld of ﬂows” (137).\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n23\n\nLocated in principle within absolute space (e.g., an assembly hall, a war room, a boardroom), individuals gathered there carry with themselves their own experiences, opinions, expectations, and agendas, which may be brought into the open during the discussion. As Harvey indicates, “Under the relational view disparate inﬂuences ﬂow from everywhere to everywhere else” (137). Since time and space fuse in this kind of space, relational space is in fact relational spacetime. Dreams and memories are, according to Harvey (137), the stuff of this fusion. In its consubstantial instability, relational spacetime destabilizes identity and individuation. Moreover, it “generates entirely different understandings of the concept of ‘place’ compared to the territorial closures and exclusions that can so easily be manufactured out of absolute conceptions” (138). Of these concepts of space, fascism prioritized absolute space over the other two, mainly because it found in that type of space a means to reorder the social under a set of hierarchical and static relationships. As envisioned by fascism, absolute space – the ultimate expression of uncontested hegemony – eliminates antagonisms, replaces the autonomy and dynamism of the subject with a static “people’s community,” shapes individual behaviour, and controls ﬂuxes. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that under certain circumstances relative space-time and relational spacetime became more dominant within the fascist politics of space. For the fascists, relative space-time was the space of the political tactics used to achieve speciﬁc goals, as well as of the strategic plans that were aimed, paradoxically, at the creation of absolute space. During the “years of struggle” in Italy (1920–2), Germany (1920–33), and Spain (1933–9), the fascist parties in those countries understood space – perhaps inevitably – as mainly relative space-time. Those were years punctuated by the fascists’ and their sympathizers’ striving for political hegemony. The design of strategic plans to gain political power and ultimately to take over the state and the nation, the dialogue with kindred political organizations, failed putsches, and the gradual consolidation of political positions within the party itself belong to the relative space-time of the fascists before their “conquest of the state” – to borrow the title of Curzio Malaparte’s famous periodical. After the fascist takeover of the state (Italy, 1925; Germany, 1933; Spain, 1939), relative spacetime would still play a dominant role in political practice, social life, and human agency. Think, for instance, of the redistribution of relationships within the political, economic, and cultural ﬁelds, the omnipresent geopolitical considerations and warmongering, which prepared the path to war and to the National Socialists’ building of a “new European order,”\n\n24\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nthe Falangists’ project to expand Spain’s “eternal values” (often grouped under the concept of Hispanidad) to Latin America, the German and Italian territorial expansion within Europe and Africa, or the train timetables designed to deport the Jews and the so-called Untermenschen. Relational spacetime was just as important. In fact, a fundamental family resemblance of fascism – its self-characterization as “movement” – constitutes a striking instance of relational spacetime.6 In the context of fascism, “movement” is not only the motion of an entity in space, but also a set of ideas, beliefs, and habitus: a “place.” Hence fascist “movements” may be considered as “places in motion.” Heirs to the turn-ofthe-century pan-movements (i.e., pan-Germanism, pan-Latinism), the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF), and Falange Española y de las JONS (FE-JONS) presented themselves as the “third way,” as “movements” altogether different from the party structures characteristic of parliamentary democracies. For Victor Klemperer, a professor of Romance Studies born to a Jewish family whose diary constitutes one of the most vivid and penetrating chronicles of everyday life in the Third Reich, Bewegung (movement) was “the quintessence, the unique quality, the very lifeblood of National Socialism which, after the Aufbruch [new departure] … would never be allowed to come to rest” (226). This statement may be applied mutatis mutandis to all fascist organizations. As movements, they set in motion a series of political, social, and cultural processes that created their own space and time. Some manifestations of the fascist generation of its own space and time through a never-ending movement are the National Socialists’ Gleichschaltung, the elimination of political antagonism and otherness from the national territory, the control of the individual’s dreams and desire, the manipulation of collective memory by rewriting national history, or the view of fascist society as an absolute break with the past. In this last case, there is a remarkable example of relational spacetime worth mentioning: the Italian Fascist calendar. Following the model of the Republican Calendar used in France from October 1793 until December 1804, the Fascists began counting the years starting with 28 October 1922 (the March on Rome) and designated the years with Roman numerals; thus, 1932 would be according to the Fascist calendar Anno X E.F. (year X of the Fascist Era). As Grifﬁn explains, “The measure of time under Mussolini points to a profoundly mythic will to create a new type of State capable of realizing a new order in which chronos will be suspended and historical time will literally be made anew” (Modernism 223).7 Furthermore, relational spacetime is closely linked to the fascist\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n25\n\nwill-to-power. According to Klemperer, for the National Socialist, “the aim is not to let things dominate you, but to dominate … one wants to be dynamisch” (226). In accordance with that dynamism and in contrast to the parties’ programs that speciﬁed their political goals, fascist movements were deliberately vague when stating political objectives, thus allowing themselves to change course at will if circumstances demanded. Fascist organizations were always on the move – most particularly the NSDAP – their main practical goal being “to organize as many people as possible within its framework and to set and keep them in motion” (Arendt, Origins 326), placing them in a perpetuum mobile of sorts. The titles Führer, Duce, and Caudillo assumed by Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco respectively emblematize the fascist movement as relational spacetime. In the history of Spanish fascism, there is a noteworthy instance of movement as relational spacetime. I am referring to the speech delivered at the Teatro de la Comedia in Madrid on 29 October 1933 by José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the dashing, reﬁned, charismatic young lawyer destined to be, somehow incongruously, the uncontested Jefe Nacional (national chief) of FE-JONS between 1934 and 1936.8 In characteristic fascist wording and tone, Primo de Rivera expressed a fundamental family resemblance of fascism when he declared to his enthralled audience: “Today’s movement” is not a party, but a movement; it is a kind of “anti-party,” neither right nor left (Obras 65).9 Such movement has, he crucially added, a generative force: what “we” want is “today’s movement” and “the state it may create” to be “the efﬁcient, authoritarian tool for the service of an indisputable unity, the permanent unity, the irrevocable unity called Fatherland” (66). Thus, in the beginning was the movement. Nothing preceded it, not even the party: indeed, Falange Española would be founded after, and not before, “today’s movement.”10 This phrase is crucial, for not only does it emphasize the absolute beginning of the movement; it also places this absolute beginning at the very moment (“today”) that the “movement” was publicly declared to exist; in other words, it locates the origins of the movement in the language used to utter it. Not coincidentally, the rightist press, Payne reminds us, “generally described the event as the founding of a Spanish fascist movement” (Fascism 92). Movement and word have here – and thereafter – a symbiotic relationship. While the movement predated the fascist party in a sort of khoratic fashion,11 the declaration of the existence of the movement produced the movement as a speciﬁc entity and put it in circulation. The movement became itself, thanks to the performativity of the word. Hence, to use freely an image from contemporary cosmology, the start of\n\n26\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nthe Spanish fascist movement may be likened to the so-called big bang, for the big-bang model allows us to interpret the origin of the universe as an event that created space-time. Performed by speech, the movement generated a space and time of its own. It was, in short, relational spacetime. Other fascist texts would stress the relational nature of the movement. In the article “Estado e historia,” published in F.E. on 25 January 1934, the anonymous author argues: “The national order cannot be static, it has to be dynamic, towards a supreme driving-force, towards a supreme reason that justiﬁes the unitary, totalitarian, and authoritarian function” (1). For the author of “Noticiero de España” (F.E., 7 December 1933), the “totalitarian state” is “a fatherland that acts” (4; my emphasis). Considering the interconnection between movement and performative speech, Primo de Rivera’s deﬁnition of the movement as a “poetic movement” (Obras 68–9) is far from arbitrary or naive.12 “The peoples,” Primo de Rivera claims, “have never been moved but by the poets” (68– 9). Since prior to this statement he had deﬁned the movement as a tool for the service of a future nation – conceived of as an absolute space – as well as the mechanism that would create the new state, it follows that movement and poetry, at least as regards their performativity, are one and the same thing. The movement is a performative speech act of sorts that, like poetry, brings into existence a space-time of its own. The movement and the word’s performance of a party, a uniﬁed nation, and an absolute state – in short, the movement’s self-deﬁnition and self-creation as relational spacetime – cohabit with the fascists’ exalted defence of an absolute space (described in absolute terms with words such as indisputable, permanent, irrevocable) identiﬁed, in Primo de Rivera’s speech, with the (fascist) state. This connection between movement and relational spacetime would be altered with the outbreak of the civil war. The Movimiento Nacional, as the movement was now called, had two different, albeit interrelated meanings. First, it denoted the conglomerate of hegemonic formations that participated in the military rebellion of 17 July 1936 against the Republic: Franco deﬁned the Movimiento Nacional as a “communion of the Spanish people in the ideals that originated the Crusade” (qtd. in Sabín Rodríguez 23). Second, it referred to the only party that resulted from the uniﬁcation decreed by Franco in April 1937 of the Carlists and the Falangists – the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS (FET de las JONS). By unifying these two parties with rather different programs and dissolving the other political organizations, Franco created a political space at once absolute and dynamic: absolute because in the political ﬁeld there would be nothing else but the Movimiento\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n27\n\nNacional, and dynamic because it was envisioned as a process. As Franco himself stressed to the listeners of his radio address (19 April 1937) announcing the uniﬁcation, “The movement that we lead today is just that: a movement more than a program. And as such it is in the process of development, subject to constant revision and improvement, to the degree that reality requires.” This was to be indeed the fate of the Movimiento Nacional during the dictatorship. In the context of fascism, the relative space-time and the relational spacetime were more often than not functions of absolute space, namely the space of truth where everybody and everything was located in and identiﬁed by ﬁxed positions established by the fascist state. Under fascism, the national territory was seen as dominated space. In a passage from Mein Kampf (1925–7), Adolf Hitler depicts that subordination eloquently if awkwardly: “If … we consider the question, what, in reality, are the state-forming or even state-preserving forces, we can sum them up under one single head: the ability and will of the individual to sacriﬁce himself in the totality” (152). “The Fatherland,” categorically asserted Primo de Rivera, “is a total unity,” a transcendent and indivisible synthesis (Obras 66). Earlier texts by Primo de Rivera and other prominent Spanish fascists already had put forth this most basic fascist principle. A civil servant, intellectually capable, published essayist and novelist, and voracious multilingual reader of philosophy, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos had written on 11 April 1931, “We want and demand the indisputable uniﬁcation of the state” (Escritos 122); to this issue he devoted many pages (Discurso 234–8; Escritos).13 Such a concept of national unity demanded as a matter of course the total subordination of the regions to the state.14 Primo de Rivera’s description of Castile, a region considered the embodiment of Spain’s essence, is a clear instance of the fascist’s defence of absolute space: “We have a lot to learn … from Castile, … the absolute land … The land that is not … the sum of several farms … but the land [sic]; the land as the repository of ever-lasting values, the austerity of behaviour, … the speech and the silence, the solidarity between ancestors and descendants … And thus Castile, with the absolute land and the absolute sky looking at each other, has never been a region; it has had to aspire, always, to being an Empire” (Obras 189–90). The evident tension between movement as relational spacetime and the nation as absolute space can be spotted easily in many texts, among them an article by Primo de Rivera entitled “Orientaciones: Hacia un nuevo Estado,” published in El Fascio on 16 March 1933 (in Obras 37–40). Referring to the new state that he aspires to create, Primo de Rivera\n\n28\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\ndeﬁnes the fatherland as a “historical totality” (40). Aside from the fact that absolute space is here the substance of the fatherland, and relative space-time merely its attribute, the expression historical totality is a contradictio in adjecto, for a “totality” is an entity that ceases to be itself as soon as historical time swallows it up. The same could be said of Falange’s view of Spain as a unity of destiny in the universal, a concept deﬁned by Primo de Rivera in a somewhat self-contradictory fashion in his speech read at the Teatro de la Comedia: “Our total sense of the Fatherland” demands that “the peoples of Spain, regardless of their diversity, feel harmonized within an irrevocable unity of destiny” (Obras 66).15 One could almost say that fascism staged a peculiar, rather improbable union of Euclidean geometry with Hegelian absolute idealism. Indeed, there were two basic inconsistencies underlying the fascist politics of space. First of all, absolute space (the state, the nation) was to be achieved through relational spacetime (the movement) and in relative space-time (the struggle for hegemony between fascism and other hegemonic formations). Second, the fascist drive to build an empire cannot be dissociated from the instability of relative space-time, that is, from the multiplicity of locations whose distance has to be measured by the units of time needed to go from one place to the other. Interestingly, in some instances fascist regimes acted out these concepts of space by following ideological and cultural preconceptions. Thus the Nazis’ view of space vis-à-vis the countries conquered by Germany depended not only on military and political considerations, but also on ideology and cultural afﬁnities. Whereas France was dealt with in terms of appropriated relative space-time, Poland and the Eastern Territories taken by the Wehrmacht suffered the imposition of a murderous absolute space. Again, the hierarchy among the three ways of understanding space depended on the situation. Within the fascist politics of space, the main nexus of the three concepts of space examined thus far were the practice of and discourse on urban planning and architecture. To begin with, images from these two disciplines permeate and suture the fascist political discourse. Even a cursory reading of the fascists’ written production reveals the extent and function of the use of spatial images. At a fundamental level, politics was considered by the fascist leadership and intelligentsia as the act of building a new organization of the social as well as an “ediﬁce,” a double meaning and a circular argument somehow reminiscent of the natura naturans, the nature that creates nature. In the preface to the ﬁrst volume of Mein Kampf, Hitler characterized his book as the “foundation stones in our common ediﬁce” (v); by “ediﬁce” Hitler meant both the political\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n29\n\ndoctrine laid out in his book and the movement of which he was part. In Spain, Primo de Rivera deﬁned the task assigned to his generation as one of “building a new politics” (Obras 40) upon the fatherland’s unity, or, as he put it elsewhere, of carrying out “the building of the harmonious, whole Spain” (692). In his above-mentioned speech of 29 October 1933, he talked about the new state that “we must strive to build” (Obras 67–8). For him, the movement’s task lay in building, by violent means, a new way of doing politics. In a notorious and well-known passage, he encouraged his audience not to shrink from violence, for “there is no other admissible dialectics than the dialectics of ﬁsts and pistols” when either justice or the fatherland is offended (67–8). And this is precisely what he and his comrades thought about the new state (68). This connection between architecture and politics was further emphasized in an article published on 28 April 1934 (Obras 229–31), wherein Primo de Rivera explicitly opposed two political ideologies through the metaphoric use of the word architecture. “Revolution” (here a word connoting Marxism) entails disorderly behaviour and destruction; it is a “disorganized mutiny” (229). Since politics is “a great task of building,” messing up the materials and throwing them around without a plan is not the best way of doing things. Whoever yearns for a true revolution must have imprinted in his soul “a new political architecture” (229), and in order to establish that political architecture, one must be in control of “all the instruments for building” (229). “The well-done revolution,” in Primo de Rivera’s opinion, “the one that truly subverts things, has as a formal characteristic ‘the order’” (229).16 Likewise, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos equated Spain’s unity with a scaffolding: “Without the unity [Spain’s] we Spaniards will always lack a steady scaffold upon which to build something serious” (Discurso 236). The “Falangist style” frequently alluded to (described by Primo de Rivera in Obras 217, 451–3) seems to refer, therefore, to a style based on principles related to architecture. We may conclude, thus, that in fascist political discourse the images “ediﬁce” and “to build” condense the grammar and pragmatics of absolute space (the state, the nation, the party), function as instances of relational spacetime (the movement, in this context, is considered as both a “builder” and a “building”), and constitute places and actions located in relative space-time (the relative location of the nation-as-a-building-in-progress within a continuum formed by the nation’s present state of disarray and the future attainment, through the act of building, of the organic and integral unity of the nation). In regard to social practices, the profound, lasting, almost obsessive interest in architecture and urban planning shown by a vast number of\n\n30\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nfascist leaders, ideologues, and intellectuals manifested itself in fascist material spatial practices, representations of space, and spaces of representation. The fascist material spatial practices were predicated on the fascist drive to impose a physical absolute space. Hence, the German Autobahn system, the marginalization of the working class to the slums of the cities in Spain during the early Franco regime, and the construction in Fascist Italy of a transportation network that converged on Rome – thereby expressing at the material level the Fascists’ concept of integral nation and of their consideration of Rome as the capital of a new Roman empire – are just a few cases of the imposition of codes and of a spatial grammar onto a non-linguistic, physical space. If we turn our attention to the fascist representations of space, we will notice that, at the most basic level, the function of urban planning and architecture resided in the elaboration of a new grammar and pragmatics of absolute spaces and places under the guidelines established by political power, frequently by the dictator of the fascist regime himself (Hitler is a widely known case in point). In difﬁcult cohabitation with this political control of planning and building were the knowledge, theories, expectations, and professional ambitions of the architects and urban planners at the service of the fascist state – factors that introduced the instability characteristic of relational spacetime within the codes designed to understand, discipline, and impose absolute space on the population. Thus, the relational spacetime of processes could inﬂuence the outcome of discussions whose underlying assumption was basically the building up of absolute space. As regards the spaces of representation, they were meant to produce a symbolic absolute space. The new Reich Chancellery, the House of German Art, the never-ﬁnished Deutsches Stadion, Germany’s Air Ministry, the Olympiastadion, the Nazi party’s rally grounds in Nuremberg, the Casa del Fascio, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Esposizione Universale Roma complex, Spain’s Ministry of the Air Force, and the Valle de los Caídos are some of the most emblematic fascist spaces of representation built in fascist Germany, Italy, and Spain. Monumental buildings had multiple functions, such as nationalistic self-assertion, political and social indoctrination, the assertion of the nation’s greatness, political intimidation and social subjugation, the strengthening of the ties among the members of the “people’s community,” the stressing of the absolute pre-eminence of the party and the state, the will to leave an everlasting mark on history, the Leader’s gloriﬁcation, and the spatial expression of absolute power.17 Many of the projected buildings and public works were never ﬁnished or even begun (most notably in Nazi Germa-\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n31\n\nny) for a variety of reasons, not least of them their economic unfeasibility and the outbreak of the war, which logically enough halted many projects. To a degree, such unﬁnishedness illustrates the tensions inherent in the production of absolute space in the modern era, the impossibility of attaining absolute power without ﬁssures, and the difﬁculty experienced by the fascists in articulating without friction the representations of space, the spaces of representation, and material spatial practices. A wide array of disciplines, technologies, materials, and tools were involved in the fascist politics and production of space. In addition to stone, brick, glass, cement, bombs, or tanks, words were fundamental tools for producing space, as we saw in the introduction. In effect, writing was a capital constituent of the fascist politics of space that greatly contributed to the fascists’ production of space. The following sections of this chapter are devoted, precisely, to prove the centrality of writing in the politics of space sketched above. It is a centrality, I should like to add, underpinned by the topographical dimension of many written works produced by fascists. Indeed, a politics of space articulates the grammar, semantics, and pragmatics of fascist writing. Writing – speciﬁcally writing putting forth a fascist politics of space – will be the ﬁrst topography of fascism studied in this book. To make my point clearer, I will focus my analysis on three seminal essays, all of them produced by one of the founding fathers and main ideologues of Spanish fascism in the 1930s, Ernesto Giménez Caballero:18 Genio de España: Exaltaciones a una resurrección nacional. Y del mundo (1932), Arte y Estado (1935), and Roma madre (1939; 1st ed. in Italian 1938). To be sure, several scholarly works have commented already on Giménez Caballero’s profound, signiﬁcant, idiosyncratic, long-lasting interest in architecture – a discipline that the writer considered the “supreme art” (Arte 245).19 But it is equally true that those studies examine the issue exclusively at a thematic level – a methodological option that, in my opinion, has limited the scope of their conclusions. It has not been taken into account, for instance, that Giménez Caballero’s high opinion of architecture in effect dominates his writing. Giménez Caballero’s fascist writing, I should like to stress, goes far beyond the author’s defence of the superiority of one art over the rest. As will be seen, the writing itself, impregnated by a fascist politics of space, produces a fascist space. The two driving forces of the production of space carried out in those three essays are the cartographic gaze and what I denominate as will-to-architecture. By cartographic gaze, I mean the series of operations carried out, in a deliberate and selfconscious fashion, to systematically produce the borders, grammar, con-\n\n32\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\ntents, and meaning of a particular space as well as the places enclosed in it. With the expression will-to-architecture, I refer to the tendency to represent as architecture the national, historical, political, artistic, and literary space. The cartographic gaze and the will-to-architecture complement each other, and both constitute essential elements of the fascist politics of space. Fascism concealed one of its fundamental operations: it hid the fact that its “knowledge” (e.g., of the history of the nation) was in fact and to a high degree a “doing.” Like other fascist intellectuals, Giménez Caballero produced the space that he claimed to be describing. Giménez Caballero describes and writes space. For this reason, his essays are topographic in terms of the two clusters of meanings of the word topography mentioned in the introduction. Giménez Caballero’s fascism provides such a double topography with an ideological direction. His essays contain an evident propagandistic function; they aspire to modify the “location” of the readers. The production of space is carried out, therefore, in the very act of enunciation: the author wants to engage the readers both with and within the topography described/written in his essays. The basic questions to answer will be not so much what Giménez Caballero “says” about space, but rather how he “produces” the space that he suggests he is “describing,” and ﬁnally, how he “places” the reader in that space. These two operations constitute fundamental techniques of the fascist politics of space. The analysis of Genio de España, Arte y Estado, and Roma madre will reveal the different ways by which absolute, relative, and relational space permeate and articulate the structure, theoretical framework, methodology, motifs, and main ideas of the writing devoted to the propagation of fascism. Mapping Genio de España made a lasting impression on anti-Republican individuals looking for answers in the turbulent 1930s and shaped the thinking of the ﬁrst generations of Spanish fascists (Selva 204–5).20 Published barely one year after the proclamation of the Second Republic, this provocative, exalted, and aggressive book – in fact the ﬁrst long, detailed exposition of a fascist doctrine ever published in Spain – represents an outstanding instance of the fascist spatial view of and approach to political and cultural issues.21 Giménez Caballero’s low opinion of history is the ﬁrst sign of the constitutive spatiality of this seminal essay. An unyielding self-conscious disregard for history saturates Genio de España. As if to set the record straight from the very beginning, the author\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n33\n\nin the introduction avows that Genio de España was conceived of without “historical pretensions”; instead he claims to have written the book with the “wisdom of a poet who feels the mystical, mysterious, oracular truth of his people speaking through his mouth” (11). Thus Giménez Caballero’s methodology consists of a poetic condensation. In contrast to historiography, poetry is better equipped, as the introduction suggests, to capture Spain’s essence in an instant of mystical communion. “The task of feeling the meaning of a people,” he remarks, does not lie in erudition, theory, or what he dismissively labels “intellectual snares,” but rather “in the Prophecy, in the communion of a vigilant soul with the quiet genius of his people” (11). Moreover, he adds, “I know that my task has the shudder of the trance, of the sacred vision, of things religious. Oracular vision and words, where the oracle is what matters less, and what matters most: the Voice on behalf of whom the oracle talks. Genius of Spain” (12).22 Indeed, Genio de España carries out the break with the lineal narrative that is implied in these claims. The work is divided into three loosely connected parts: the ﬁrst is devoted to the decadence of Spain since the seventeenth century as well as the remedies applied to stop it; the second is a critique of José Ortega y Gasset’s España invertebrada (1921) in counterpoint to Giménez Caballero’s own ideas on the topics treated in that book; and the third expounds on the author’s proposal for the “resurrection” of Spain from a fascist perspective. Far from elaborating his ideas in an organized and systematic fashion, Giménez Caballero presents them in an impressionistic language within a choppy dispositio. The practice in Genio de España of what Joseph Frank (31–132) termed spatial form was nothing new in the works of Giménez Caballero. It can be found, in fact, in his avant-garde oeuvre of the 1920s. The collage, simultaneity, and visual literature articulating Carteles (1927), the dissolution of sequentiality in his surrealist novel Yo, inspector de alcantarillas (1928), as well as the application of a spatial analytic device called “ludigrama” (literally “ludigram”) to the study of games in Hércules jugando a los dados (1928) share with Genio de España a characteristic modernist rejection of history.23 The liquidation of history brought about by the Anglo-American and European modernism in the 1910s and 1920s challenged causation and chronology – two pillars of modern historiography and nineteenth-century realism – as valid means to articulate a narrative. Modernism prioritized space over time, or, to be more precise, it spatialized time, utilizing a procedure amply theorized in many avantgarde manifestos and theoretical pieces that, in effect, refracted radical\n\n34\n\nTopographies of Fascism\n\nchanges in the conception and perception of time and space since the turn of the century.24 Symptomatically, that theoretical positioning and literary practice would saturate fascist ideology as well as several artistic and literary artefacts connected in one way or the other to fascism. Fascism, Mosse reminds us, “considered itself as avant-garde: a group of men who were leading society into the post-liberal age” (Fascist 137). The apocalyptic tone, the wish to substitute “youthful vigor for old age” (138), the championing of modern industry and technology, the search for the “new man,” and the dynamism of fascism are family resemblances of the avant-gardes.25 According to Grifﬁn, two elements of that kinship between fascism and modernism are, on the one hand, the fascist sense of beginning, of a complete, iconoclastic, deﬁnitive break with the past, and on the other, the mood of standing on the threshold of an altogether new world cemented by Aufbruch, or the “state of expectancy induced by the intuitive certainty that an entire phase of history is giving way to a new one” (Grifﬁn, Modernism 9).26 The penchant for violence and direct action, the contempt for bourgeois morality, and the exaltation of war are constituents of the fascist ideology and habitus as well as of the avantgardes. Furthermore, in the literary ﬁeld the Italian Futurism,27 certain manifestations of Vorticism (most particularly Ezra Pound’s and Wyndham Lewis’s work)28 and the avant-garde artefacts of Falangist authors (such as Tomás Borrás, Antonio de Obregón, Samuel Ros, and Felipe Ximénez de Sandoval)29 constitute instances of the overlapping of fascism and modernism. Genio de España is perhaps the most complete and signiﬁcant fusion of fascism and avant-gardism in Spain. Giménez Caballero expressed his fascist thinking and habitus through modernist techniques with which he was well acquainted; these techniques are characterized – let us insist on this – by a liquidation of history and spatial form. To put it with Hewitt’s words apropos of the relationship between fascism and the avant-garde, “History has ceased, with the avant-garde, to function as a legitimating instance. One cannot simply return to a premodern linearity, either in theory or in practice.… Both politically and aesthetically, ‘progress’ and ‘reaction’ can no longer be fully disengaged as historical concepts. The stage is set for Fascist Modernism” (Fascist Modernism 47). In Genio de España, the knowledge of the history and essence of Spain – two of the main topics of that book – can be attained only by an eidetic reduction of sorts. By this method, Giménez Caballero moves from consciousness to the trans-empirical realm of the essence of the nation and of the world. A “transcendental gaze” (66) transfers the contents of consciousness to the external world. The truth of the nation’s history, claims\n\nA Politics of Space\n\n35\n\nGiménez Caballero, resides in the depths of oneself because “oneself is a historical and national outcome” (66). By the same token, consciousness generates its own space and time. In this sense, at the metaphysical and epistemic levels Genio de España builds its ideas – among them a defence of absolute space – upon a relational spacetime. Since this is expressed through writing, the book itself may be viewed as an instance of relational spacetime – as a literary artefact that is the ultimate outcome of a transcendental consciousness generating its own space and time. The regeneration of Spain, the book’s main goal, is the outcome of the same process: “It is something mystical (an inspiration, an intuition), what decides once and for all the solution to the radical problems of a country” (66). This epoché seems to be the most adequate way “to intuit the immanent generating genius where this contingent I [is] placed and rebound; namely, the genius of a people” (213). Consistent with this phenomenological reduction, Giménez Caballero repeatedly employs spatial images; words such as assertion, intuition, or amalgamation overlap with toponyms along with words that relate to space, such as construction; as he writes in the introduction to Genio de España, “The third part of this book is devoted to construction and to afﬁrmations. To the immediate implementation of my radical intuition: of my melding with what I call the genius of Spain” (12). This is yet another instance of relational spacetime, of the generation by the consciousness of its own space and time by means of a transcendental gaze manifested through writing. Giménez Caballero interprets the history of Spain as a process made up of two interrelated binary structures: emptiness/plenitude and dissolution/construction. Committed to a country conceived of as an integral, total, and organic unit, he manifests his fear of national dissolution, an otherwise central family resemblance of fascism studied by Theweleit, among others, in territorial terms.30 The history of Spain has been tragically marked, according to Giménez Caballero (7–12), by thirteen “9"
