Scandinavian Property Group is developing a new and sustainable residential area focusing on active seniors next to Gulskogen Station in Drammen municipality. Aimed at first-time buyers and families with children, Gulskogen will be a neighbourhood that is attractive and accessible to everyone, regardless of life situation, economic status or purchasing power.

SPG has two ongoing housing projects in Drammen, approximately 650 apartments at the old shipyard of Drammen Slip & Verksted, and this development project in collaboration with the Halmrast family, which involves around 400 apartments. The land currently consists of an industrial property that has been owned by the Halmrast family for over 70 years.

The expected sales launch for these projects is in 2025.
