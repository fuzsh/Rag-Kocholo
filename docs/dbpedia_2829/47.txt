Norwegian rail infrastructure operator Bane Nor held a special ceremony to mark the first rock blasting operations on the project to create a new double track from Drammen to Kobbervikdalen.

Norway’s minister of transport Jon Georg Dale triggered the blasts at the Skoger construction site and described the occasion as a “milestone” for the scheme.

The project, which is being delivered by contractor Veidekke, includes a 7km long tunnel through Strømsåsen and reconstruction of Drammen and Gulskogen stations.

“We are now working on an expansion that will allow us to transport more passengers in an efficient and environmentally friendly way,” said Dale. “Bane Nor will build a new double track on Vestfoldbanen from Drammen station to Skoger, where the new track connects to existing double track. The project is a central part of the work to establish a continuous double track between Oslo and Tønsberg in 2024. This facilitates more departures and shorter travel time.
