        "text": "The Norwegian national railway infrastructure manager, Bane NOR, announced the prequalification for one of the main contracts on the large Drammen-Kobbervikdalen project, an InterCity-project, part of the ongoing modernization of the Vestfold Line. The contract is expected to be signed in June 2019, construction is to start in August 2019 and be completed by March 2023.\n\nIn order to o ensure early involvement from suppliers and find the best possible solutions, Bane NOR has chosen Competitive Dialogue as procurement procedure. The prequalification notice concerns the EPC contract for building a concrete tunnel (cut and cover) and a soil tunnel. “Bane NOR wants early involvement of suppliers, and this is the reason for choosing Competitive Dialogue as procurement procedure. By involving the market we can discuss how we should solve our challenges and ensure innovation in our business,” project’s Head of Contract, Eirik Harding Hansen, said.\n\nThe project Drammen-Kobbervikdalen includes 10 km of double-track railway between Drammen and Kobbervikdalen and between Drammen station and Gulskogen station, a 6-km long rock tunnel, as well as the concrete tunnel and soil tunnel. The latter two are in a separate contract (UDK 02).\n\nThe construction is scheduled to start in 2019, and the project is to be completed in 2025.\n\nThe construction works are split into three main contracts. Prequalification for the rock tunnel EPC contract (UDK 01) is to be announced in September 2018. Prequalification for the concrete tunnel and soil tunnel EPC contract (UDK 02) was announced in June 2018. Prequalification for the implementation contract encompassing the stretch between Drammen station and Gulskogen station, as well as technical railway works for the entire project (UDK 03), is to be announced in May 2019.\n\nYou can find more details about the competitive dialogue on the European public procurement journal, TED.\n\nShare on:"
