        "text": "On September 28, Norway’s rail infrastructure manager, Bane Nor, has launched transport services on the new double track line between Farriside and Porsgrunn, on the Vestfold line.\n\nThe project included the construction of a 22.5-km double-track section between Farriseidet and Porsgrunn, designed for speeds up to 250 km/h, as well as seven separate tunnels, totaling 15 km, and ten bridges, totaling 1.5 km.\n\n“The project is an important step for rail evolution. At the beginning, travel time between Porsgrunn and Larvik took one hour, but now we celebrate a 12-minutes journey between the two stations,” Minister of Transport, Jon Georg Dale, said during the opening ceremony which took place at Larvik Station. When timetable will be changed, starting this December, the travel time between Larvik and Porsgrunn will be reduced to 12 minutes, from 34 minutes, and between Oslo S and Skien stations, it will be reduced to 2 hours and 12 minutes, instead 2 hours and 39 minutes.\n\nThe Vestfold line modernisation project also envisages the construction of a 10-km of double track from Drammen to Kobbervikdalen and between Drammen and Gulskogen. The project includes 10 km of double track from Drammen to Kobbervikdalen, a 7-km rock tunnel, a 275-metre long concrete tunnel, a branch line towards Nybyen and a new 160-metre bridge that will cross European route E18 at Kobbervikdalen.\n\nDrammen station and Gulskogen station will be upgraded with both new platforms and tracks.\n\nThe construction of a 14-km double-track between Nykirke to Barkåker (north of Tønsberg) will also be implemented under the Vestfold line modernisation project. The new line consists of two bridges, four tunnels totaling 5.3 kilometres, and a new modern station west of Skoppum. The new section will be put into commercial operation starting 2024.\n\nIn 2025 construction works are scheduled to begin for the construction of 40 km of double track from Tønsberg to Larvik, which will be completed in 2032. The travel time will be reduced by 40 minutes between the two stations.\n\nAs part of Vestfold line modernisation project, in 2016, Holmestrand-Parsellen section was opened, while Barkåker-Tønsberg opened in 2011.\n\nShare on:"
