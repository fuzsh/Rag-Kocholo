My role in the Last Mile Delivery team has not only been a job but a transformative experience, merging my passion for logistics with the pursuit of sustainable solutions. Since joining IKEA, I've been witness to a revolution in home delivery, particularly here in Norway, where our commitment to sustainability and efficiency has taken center stage. At IKEA, we understand that shopping is more than just a transaction; it's an experience infused with emotions and sensations. From the moment customers browse our website or step into our stores, we strive to create an environment that resonates with them. However, the journey doesn't end at the checkout counter. It extends to the last mile of delivery, where we've embarked on a mission to redefine the customer experience while minimizing our environmental impact. The launch of IKEA's Delivery Management Platform (DMP) marks a significant milestone in our endeavor to reinvent home delivery. By taking control of route planning and delivery logistics, we've empowered ourselves to curate every step of the delivery process, from the store to the customer's doorstep. This level of control not only enhances efficiency but also allows us to prioritize sustainability. In Norway, where the breathtaking landscapes pose unique challenges to logistics, DMP has been a game-changer. From the bustling urban streets of Oslo to the serene fjords of Trondheim, we've navigated diverse terrains with a singular goal in mind: to deliver IKEA products with minimal environmental impact. Through meticulous route planning and the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, we're not only reducing our carbon footprint but also setting a new standard for sustainable last mile deliveries. The integration of technology enhances the customer experience with timely notifications and tracking, ensuring a seamless delivery process. This approach drives satisfaction and loyalty, evident in positive feedback since implementing DMP. IKEA's unwavering commitment to sustainability guides every decision, from renewable energy vehicles to eco-friendly packaging. It permeates every aspect of our operations, from material sourcing to product delivery. Reflecting on my IKEA journey, I'm optimistic for the future. Each day brings opportunities to innovate in sustainable last mile deliveries. Proud to be part of a company actively working towards a greener future, we navigate the path to sustainability together. #IKEA #LASTMILE\n\nI recently had the delightful experience of assembling an organizer gifted to me by a friend from IKEA. Firstly, I want to express my gratitude to my friend for this thoughtful birthday gift. Secondly, I was deeply impressed by the incredible experience of firsthand engagement with IKEA's efficient supply chain and business model. As an international business and supply chain student, I have often encountered IKEA in case studies, recognizing it as a quintessential example of compact logistics innovations. This personal experience underscored how IKEA's inventory management and cost-cutting techniques at each node of the supply chain contribute to their overall efficiency. Experiencing the assembly process from a customer's perspective, while having insights into the business side of the operation, was profoundly enlightening. This hands-on experience reaffirmed the value of field trips and practical engagement in understanding complex concepts. It‚Äôs one thing to study a business model theoretically, but witnessing it in action provides a richer and more comprehensive understanding. Here‚Äôs a glimpse of the assembly process... #IKEA #ikeabusiness #businessmanagement ##supplychainefficiency #logistics #DIY\n\nThe Philippines' green logistics supplier Mober Technology Pte., Inc. has established sustainable delivery services in Cebu to support Swedish home furnishing retailer IKEA Philippines' regional expansion. Mober said on Wednesday that as IKEA Philippines' green logistics partner, it will employ its 100% electric vehicle fleet to enable zero-emission home deliveries in Cebu and other Visayas regions. This complements IKEA's regional demand for high-quality, affordable home products and Mober's eco-friendly logistics solutions, it said. Mober's collecting centre in Cebu City would speed up delivery and increase product accessibility for Visayan families in addition to sustainable delivery services. IKEA Philippines' environmental items and Mober's EV charging stations are delivered last at the collection hub. The statement said Mober's Cebu City facility supports IKEA's EV fleet with its latest 15kw OCPP chargers, which are type 2 and GB/T compliant. ‚ÄúThis represents a leap forward for the Philippines in embracing sustainable practices across the logistics industry,‚Äù said Mober Founder and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Ng. He added Mober can leverage its all-electric fleet to provide sustainable business solutions for a net-zero carbon emission future as EV adoption grows. Mober, founded in July 2015, helps FMCG and retail firms sustain their supply chains. Mober works with IKEA Philippines, SM Appliance Centre, Unilever Philippines, Nestle Philippines, Nespresso, Maersk, and Kuehne+Nagel. Mober's #partnership approach gives businesses an exceptional advantage by allowing them to convert to green delivery operations without CapEx or upfront fees. The company plans to lead green logistics in Southeast Asia, starting in the Philippines, with an expanding fleet and new solutions, ensuring a sustainable logistics business.
