        "text": "Home\n\nEurope\n\nNorway\n\nDrammen\n\nDrammen is a town and municipality in the province of Buskerud in Viken county. It is located where the Drammensvassdraget empties into the Drammensfjord. The municipality borders Lier in the northeast, Holmestrand in the south and Ãvre Eiker in the west. Drammen is located approx. 40 km southwest of Oslo. The municipality was merged with Nedre Eiker and Svelvik into the new Drammen municipality from 1 January 2020 and became Norway's 7th largest municipality in population.\n\nThe timber trade in the Drammen area formed the basis for the growth of the city, which in the 18th century developed into one of Eastern Norway's most important maritime and commercial cities; in 1715, the charging stations StrÃ¸msÃ¸ and Bragernes were each given the status of a market town. Drammen became part of Buskerud county in 1760 and was later the administration center in Buskerud county until 2020. In modern times, Drammen is the center of one of the fastest growing urban regions in Norway, the Drammen region, which is part of the metropolitan region around Oslo. fifth largest. The urban buildings extend far beyond the municipal boundaries; into the municipalities of Lier, Asker, Ãvre Eiker and Holmestrand. The town's total population is 109,416 inhabitants as of 1 January 2020. Drammen municipality has 100 581 inhabitants after the municipal reform, and is the seventh largest in the country, by population. About 21 percent of Drammen municipality's population has an immigrant background.\n\nTopography\n\nDrammen is located in a valley at the mouth of the Drammenselva in the Drammensfjord, hence the name Â«River town DrammenÂ». After the end of the last ice age, Drammensdalen got its current shape, and after 10,000 years of land uplifts, more of the valley floor has been liberated. Drammen municipality comprises 145.2 kmÂ², of which approx. 89.9 kmÂ² is forest area, 15.8 kmÂ² agricultural area and 9.5 kmÂ² water. The landscape in Drammen is characterized by dense settlement along the river and the fjord that extends up the hillsides. Drammen center is located about 2 masl. Drammensmarka is the forest area northwest of the city that forms the southeastern part of the larger area Finnemarka. Drammensmarka and Finnemarka are a popular hiking area with a very well-developed network of ski trails and hiking trails. In Finnemarka is also Lake Glitre, which is the main source of drinking water in Drammen. The highest point in Drammensmarka is Skimten, 553 masl.\n\nAt the top of StrÃ¸msÃ¥sen on the south side of Drammen is the district Konnerud surrounded by the forest areas Konnerudmarka, MjÃ¸ndalsskauen and Vestskauen. Southeast of Konnerud, towards the border with Vestfold, is the district Skoger, which is characterized by large agricultural areas.\n\nA special nature formation is KjÃ¸sterudjuvet\n\nThe highest point in Drammen municipality is Trettekollen, 607.3 m a s l.\n\nGeology\n\nGeologically, Drammen is located within the so-called Oslo field. The bedrock in large parts of the municipality consists of the nutrient-poor red Drammen granite (Biotite granite). Rhombic porphyry, a volcanic rock, is otherwise dominant in the municipality, while limestone from the Cambrian-Silurian period makes its mark on some localities.\n\nQuaternary geologically, Drammen is characterized by a large glacier that filled the valley for approx. 10,000 years ago and built an end moraine, the Svelvik moraine, across the Drammensfjord at Svelvik. The loose masses on the valley floor consist of the bottom moraines and river deposits, while the valley sides are covered by side moraines and stone clocks where no solid rock is visible.\n\nClimate\n\nDrammen is in the climate zone cold-temperate climate. The climate type in Drammen is cold and humid, with hot summers.\n\nDrammen is less affected by the Oslo Fjord than Oslo and therefore has a slightly lower average temperature in winter than the capital.\n\nThe highest temperature measured is 35.0 Â° C, which was measured on August 3, 1982.\n\nNature and environment\n\nThe Drammenselva was for a long time heavily polluted, i.a. of the industrial enterprises by the river. Factories along the river released waste products, and the sewage went straight into the river without treatment. During the 1980s and 1990s, the river was cleaned and is again one of Norway's best salmon rivers. There are several parks in the city and also several beaches at Drammenselva. On the south and north side of Drammen there are large forest areas with many fishing lakes.\n\nDrammens Sportfiskere is a voluntary organization that, among other things, releases fish in over 200 waters, in the Drammen area, on a voluntary basis.\n\nTransport\n\nDrammen participates in Buskerudbyen, a long-term collaboration on area, transport and environment between seven partners. Buskerudbyen receives support from the state reward scheme for better public transport, increased bicycle use and more pedestrians, and thus no increase in private car use in the Buskerudby area between Kongsberg and Lier. Drammen is a hub for communication by both car and train.\n\nThe main road network in Drammen\n\nE18 is the main connection to the cities of Oslo and Vestfold. It passes the city center via a four-lane high bridge which is Norway's longest. From the E18 in Lier, take European road 134 (Oslofjord connection) to the E6 at Vassum in Frogn. County road 282 from BrakerÃ¸ya to LyngÃ¥s in Lier crosses European road 134 at Amtmannsvingen in Lier municipality. From the E18, the E134 on the south side of the Drammenselva leads west to Hokksund and Kongsberg and on to Haugesund. On the north side, county road 283 goes via the Bragerne tunnel to MjÃ¸ndalen. On the west side of Drammensfjorden, county road 319 goes to Svelvik and on to Sande in Vestfold. The short distance to Oslo also means that the city gets more and more commuters. Drammen has an inner ring road that directs traffic outside the city center. The ring road goes in a tunnel on the Bragernessiden side and crosses the river over the Holmen bridges and Ãvre Sund bridge. On StrÃ¸msÃ¸, the ring road follows county road 282. The ring road is connected to the E18 on BrakerÃ¸ya and on BangelÃ¸kka, where the E134 is also connected.\n\nRailway and public transport\n\nDrammen is an important railway hub in Norway. Drammen station is the terminus on the Drammen line and at the same time an important station on the Vestfold line, the SÃ¸rlands line and the Randsfjord line / Bergens line. SÃ¸rlandsbanen and Bergensbanen go west Drammensdalen through Gulskogen, MjÃ¸ndalen and Hokksund, where they separate teams, while Vestfoldbanen turns south just after Drammen station and goes through Kobbervikdalen and Skoger towards Vestfold -byene and Skien / Porsgrunn. Drammen station is Flytoget's western terminus. Drammen station was reopened on 15 June 2011 after an extensive rebuild and refurbishment. The railway bridges over the Drammenselva were partly rebuilt and extended to two tracks in 1996."
