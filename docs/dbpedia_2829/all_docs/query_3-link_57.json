The two 485 and 472 m long Filstal bridges are located between the 8,806 m long Boßler Tunnel to the northwest and the 4,8047 m long Steinbühl Tunnel to the southeast. The two tubes of the Boßler Tunnel were excavated conventionally and with a TBM. The main section from the Umpfental intermediate approach was driven conventionally and approx. 2,800 m were driven from the Aichelberg portal using a TBM. Both drives of the Steinbühl Tunnel were carried out from the Pfaffenäcker excavation pit using the shotcrete method. In principle, all tunnel tubes are pressure-tight.\n\nPlace: Baden-Württemberg, Germany\n\nClient: DB Netz AG\n\nCommissioned by: ATA Arge Tunnel Albaufstieg (PORR / G.

Geodata received the order for tunnel driving control and the supply of geotechnical instrumentation for a total of more than 30 km of TBM tunneling, 15 km of conventional tunneling, cross passages and the emergency stop.\n\nDue to the cancellation of the construction contract with the consortium carrying out the work by BBT SE, the work had to be terminated prematurely.\n\nProject description:\n\nThe VERBUND power plant Ybbs-Persenbeug was Austria’s first power plant on the Danube and is located in Lower Austria. The interior of the power plant has been undergoing modernization since 2014. One machine set (turbine and generator) is renewed each year, and all six vertical machine sets are to be replaced by 2022. This will significantly increase the power generation of the power plant. The resulting additional generation corresponds to the annual electricity consumption of 22,000 households.\n\nThe 460 m long dam wall holds back the Danube over a length of about 34 km and up to a height of 10.9 m. The dam will be built on the banks of the Danube. The volume of the reservoir is approx. 74 million m³, the targeted water level is 226.2 m above sea level.\n\nThe two locks are located at the left, northern end of the dam, each with a usable length of 230 m and a usable width of 24 m.\n\nThe weir consists of 5 weir fields with a width of 30 m each and is located in the middle of the dam wall.\n\nLocation: Lower Austria; Austria\n\nClient: VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH/Andritz AG\n\nPerformance period: 2013 -2018\n\nGEODATA services:\n\nThe power plant has 7 machine units, six of which are vertically installed Kaplan turbines and one Kaplan bulb turbine. The measurement was carried out on machine sets 4, 5 and 6. The aim of the survey was a target-performance comparison of the guide vane positions in the guide vane as well as a geometry determination. The contour of the impeller casing was also determined by a target/actual comparison.\n\nIn addition, the measurement was carried out at the lower head of the sluice system before dismantling the mortise gate drives as a basis for realignment in the course of assembly with the new back suspension beams.\n\nProject description:\n\nThe full extension of the 8.3 km long Gleinalm tunnel comprises the construction of the second tube and the general renewal of the existing tube.

The tunnel is divided into three parts:\n\nThe Upper Filder Tunnel was excavated using a shield machine in multi-mode.\n\nThe Middle Filder Tunnel was built over a length of 1.1 km through the Upper and Lower Bunter Marl using the NATM construction method.\n\nThe Lower Filder Tunnel, with a length of 4.1 km, crossed the anhydrite-bearing unleached gypsum keuper. For this, the TBM used had to be converted into an open shield machine.\n\nLot 1B\n\nWith its two parallel single-track tunnels, the Ober-/Untertürkheim feeder line will connect the southern exit of the new underground station with the existing line. The approach consists of a main tunnel that leads from the junction structure at the northern end of the Lower Filder Tunnel in an easterly direction to the Wangen junction structures. Shortly before Wangen is the Ulmer Straße intermediate access shaft, via which the main tunnel is excavated to the west and east to the Wangen branching structures. From Wangen, a section leads northwards, where it reaches the open construction method of the Untertürkheim construction pit after around 1 km. A second section leads from the Wangen junction to the south-east and ends after almost 1.4 km in the Obertürkheim excavation pit.\n\nAt the “Hauptbahnhof Süd” emergency access road, a 240 m long access tunnel leads directly into a complex branching structure, in which four tunnel tubes lead into two large double-track tunnels directly in front of the underground station. This section is located directly underneath densely built-up areas with overburdens of between 20 m and 55 m and was constructed with leading pillar tunnels.\n\nPlace: Baden-Württemberg, Germany\n\nClient: DB Netz AG\n\nCommissioned by: ARGE ATCOST21 (PORR / G.
