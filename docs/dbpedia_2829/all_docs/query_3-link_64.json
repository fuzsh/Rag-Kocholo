        "text": "About\n\nKJ-A at Nordic\n\nKJ-A (Kristin Jarmund Architects), was established in 1985 and has over the years attained a high profile on the architectural scene in Norway. In 2022 the company united with Nordic Office of Architecture, creating one of the Nordic region’s strongest architectural communities.\n\nA shared design philosophy was one of the many things bringing the companies together – a philosophy which aims at solutions that reduce complex problems to simplicity in form and function, while at the same time allowing for a sensitive awareness to context and the human dimension.\n\nMaking quality architecture is a team effort. KJ-A will be an integral part of Nordic, but will operate in a way that allows employees and clients alike to be confident in the continuing quality and integrity of the KJ-A brand."
