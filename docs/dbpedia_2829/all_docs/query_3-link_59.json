The document discusses upcoming railway projects in Norway, focusing on Bane NOR's InterCity project. The InterCity project involves building 270 km of new double tracks and 25 stations to connect major cities in southeast Norway with speeds up to 250 km/h. It is estimated to cost 150 billion NOK. The new tracks will improve regional travel and freight services. Construction will take place in four stages between 2024-2034. Bane NOR also plans new train storage areas to support more frequent departures made possible by the InterCity project.",
