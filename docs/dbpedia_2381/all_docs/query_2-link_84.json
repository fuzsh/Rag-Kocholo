        "text": "A child’s hands allegedly caught fire while touching an exhibit at Questacon, leaving them with serious injuries and landing the National Science and Technology Centre in court.\n\nThe Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has filed a single charge in the ACT Magistrates Court against the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR), of which Questacon is a portfolio agency.\n\nThe charge alleges DISR failed in its duties under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (WHS Act).\n\nIt follows a Comcare investigation that found a spark from a plasma globe ignited alcohol-based hand sanitiser used by a nine-year-old child visiting the centre, causing burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nThe sanitiser was supplied by Questacon.\n\nThe child allegedly touched the plasma globe as part of an interactive exhibit in one of Questaconâs galleries.\n\nThe incident happened at Questaconâs Canberra facility on 23 July 2022.\n\nThe investigation has now been finalised, and it has resulted in the department being charged with breaching federal work health and safety laws.\n\nComcareâs investigation alleges the department failed in its primary health and safety duty under the WHS Act, but it could have eliminated or minimised risks through measures including:\n\nRemoving the plasma globes after discovering the fire risk from alcohol-based hand sanitiser\n\nLimiting the use and operation of the plasma globes to trained Questacon workers\n\nProviding a non-alcohol-based sanitiser or portable soap and water handwashing stations, and/or\n\nWarning visitors about spark ignition and the risk of fire.\n\nThe matter is listed for mention in the ACT Magistrates Court on 12 September 2024.\n\nQuestacon is not commenting on the incident, referring all enquiries to its overseeing department, DISR.\n\nDISR says it is unable to comment as the matter is now before the courts, but it confirmed that the plasma ball in question had been removed from Questaconâs exhibits.\n\nâThe Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has commenced proceedings against the Department of Industry, Science and Resources in response to an investigation into an alleged breach of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011,â a department spokesperson said.\n\nâGiven this matter is now before the courts, the department cannot comment on the details of the incident at this time.\n\nâSafety of both visitors and staff at the centre is of paramount importance to Questacon and we are committed to maintaining Questacon as a safe place for Australians to visit.\n\nâFollowing the incident, Questacon has implemented a range of actions, including removal of the plasma ball exhibit.â\n\nComcare is the national authority for workplace health and safety and workersâ compensation."
