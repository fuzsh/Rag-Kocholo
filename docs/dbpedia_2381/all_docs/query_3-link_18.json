Not only do we see colour every day, but essentially every day colours are all we see. To try and rattle you in your boots and wake you up to the subjective beauty of colour and the wonder of it as known through science, Questacon’s opened a new exhibit — Colour: See the world in a new light.\n\nTo add a six-legged facet to the exhibit, our National Research Collections have contributed some of the phenomenal diversity of colourful insects, and the myriad ways they use those colours: mimicry, warnings, and camouflage. Speaking of taking colour for granite, Geoscience Australia are also contributing colourful geological specimens to the exhibit.\n\nHere are some of the vibrant (and sometimes mute and coy) insects you’ll see when you visit the exhibit:"
