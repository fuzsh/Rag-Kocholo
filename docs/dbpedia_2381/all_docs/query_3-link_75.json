(AP PHOTO)\n\n\"I saw like a little opening of net and I was just like, 'I've got to put it there. Just put it there,'\" Smith said. \"It was a good feeling. I know I had a few other chances this game that I should have put away. But sometimes one is all it takes.\"\n\nThe United States had missed out on the finals at the last two Olympic tournaments, eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and relegated to the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nIn Marseille, Paredes' sixth-minute own goal put Brazil in control and Portilho doubled the advantage in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time.\n\nSpanish players react after their semi-final loss to Brazil. (AP PHOTO)\n\nAdriana's header in 71st underlined Brazil's dominance.\n\nSalma Paralluelo pulled a goal back for Spain with a header in the 85th and almost immediately Alexia Putellas struck the bar with a shot from outside the area.\n\nKerolin made it 4-1 in the first minute of stoppage time - shooting through Coll's legs â€” before Paralluelo got her second in the 12th minute of stoppage time. By then, though, it was too late for Spain to mount a comeback.\n\nAustralian Associated Press\n\nDAILY DURING PARALYMPICS\n\nThe Paralympic Breakfast\n\nGet the best news and analysis from the Paris Paralympic Games in a daily update.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
