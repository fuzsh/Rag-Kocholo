The Milky Way is no longer visible to an estimated third of humanity, including more than half of Australians, thanks to light pollution.\n\nThis August, the ABC is exploring the dark sky and the impact of light pollution on science, creatures, and culture. Light pollution in the night sky is a problem for astronomers and stargazers, it confuses the circadian rhythms of some creatures and misguides the navigation of others, impacts Sky Country and Indigenous cultural practices, and contributes to sleep deprivation in humans.\n\nABC Science will invite people to explore the dark sky, contribute to an Australian National University study of the Milky Way’s visibility, see solutions to light pollution, stargaze with Radio National and guest astronomers, and vote in their poll on ‘the most amazing thing you’ve seen in the night sky.’\n\nMonday 31 July – Friday 16 August: www.scienceweek.net.au/exploring-dark-skies-with-abc/ or www.abc.net.au/nightsky.\n\nMedia enquiries: Shelley Thomas, shelley@scienceinpublic.com.au or 0416 377 444.\n\nScientists available for media interviews.\n\nAbout National Science Week\n\nNational Science Week is Australia’s annual opportunity to meet scientists, discuss hot topics, do science and celebrate its cultural and economic impact on society – from art to astrophysics, chemistry to climate change, and forensics to future food.\n\nFirst held in 1997, National Science Week has become one of Australia’s largest festivals. Last year about 2.7 million people participated in more than 1,860 events and activities.\n\nThe festival is proudly supported by the Australian Government, CSIRO, the Australian Science Teachers Association, and the ABC.\n\nIn 2024 it runs from Saturday 10 to Sunday 18 August. Event details can be found at www.scienceweek.net.au.\n\nContact details:"
