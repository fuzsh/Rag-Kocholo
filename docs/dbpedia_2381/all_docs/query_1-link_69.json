        "text": "Partnering for powerful science communication\n\nWe’ve been bombarded with pandemic news and messaging for over a year. But have you ever wanted to meet the experts behind the headlines? Or dig a little deeper with a researcher – not an internet know-it-all?\n\nIn a ‘pandemic first’ (pre-lockdown of course), ANU has partnered with Questacon to bring the science of pandemics directly to the people. Academics from the College of Health and Medicine, and the Population Health Exchange (PHXchange), have rolled up their sleeves to collaborate on innovative ways to communicate their research.\n\nWe bet you’ve never been to a seminar on misinformation hosted by a Drag Queen, for example, but with the creativity of Questacon it was an obvious choice.\n\nDr Eryn Newman, memory and cognition expert, helped in the creation of a ‘Miss Information pageant’ (yes, it’s a double entendre).\n\nThrough their insidious tactics, the misinformation pageant contestants: Fay Kexperts, Annique Dotal, Cherri Pickken, and Con Spearitzy showed us the many ways that misinformation can hurt individuals, communities and public health. Contestant ‘judges’, PhD students Mary Jiang and Deva Ly were quick to debunk these.\n\n\"We have seen the rapid spread of false information online since the pandemic started,” said Eryn. “Now, as we engage in efforts to get our communities vaccinated, dealing with misinformation is paramount. The Questacon event was a fun way to demonstrate this and make reliable information accessible to the public.”\n\nWith the audience safely inoculated against viral information, virologist Professor David Tscharke and Epidemiologist Dr Meru Sheel, described how the AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines work, and how COVID-19 infection rates and proportion of hospitalisation change as vaccination rates increase.\n\nOnce again theatrics were embraced by comparing the functions of our cells to that of an office and office equipment. Questacon actors performed the ‘office work’ of vaccines, resulting in spike proteins that trigger our body’s defensive response against COVID-19.\n\n“When a virus infects a human cell, it captures the cell’s factories and turns them to churning out ‘copies’ of itself, so using an analogy like an office is a useful way of helping people understand how vaccines work,” said David.\n\nAs was an informal conversation about pandemics hosted by journalist Dan Bourchier, with epidemiologists Associate Professor Katie Glass and Associate Professor Lisa Whop. The discussion focussed on how communication and community are crucial in combatting COVID-19.\n\n\"There are some great examples of where leadership and trust have been successful, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as an example. So, these types of conversations are useful in helping to expand public thinking on the path out of this COVID pandemic,\" says Lisa.\n\nWhile the 100+ audience members enjoyed a fun, informative and high energy night, importantly, they also contributed to valuable research aimed at improving science communication. Dr Ginny Sargent, Lead ANU Population Health Exchange led this work.\n\n\"We embedded research in all aspects of the event. Not only were our academics presenting on their research areas of expertise, but the Team conducted research about the audience experience on the night. We will use this to help us become even better science communicators.\"\n\nThis collaboration is the beginning of an ongoing relationship between the College of Health and Medicine and Questacon, and builds on one already established between Questacon and the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at ANU. Much thanks to the many ANU and Questacon staff and ANU students who helped make the night a huge success."
