This is where we’ll end today’s coverage.\n\nTo conclude, here’s a look back at the day’s major stories:\n\nDeputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said Australians are going to have a “tough Christmas” after Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock said there were no expected cuts to interest rates in the next six months.\n\nAustralia is joining the US, Canada and the Philippines for military exercises in waters contested by China in a first for the four nations’ forces operating together. Defence Minister Richard Marles and Foreign Minister Penny Wong attended meetings with their US counterparts at the Australian-US ministerial dialogue, known as AUSMIN, with Marles saying they agreed to “practical measures to progress our shared priorities”.\n\nTravel advice for Bangladesh was upgraded to “Do not travel” ahead of the country finalising an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus.\n\nIn Victoria, tributes from across the political divide flowed for three-time Maribyrnong mayor Sarah Carter. The 45-year-old failed to show up for a flight to Europe with her partner before he found her dead at home on Tuesday.\n\nIn NSW, police revealed a warehouse employee was charged over the alleged theft of $600,000 of unreleased Bluey themed “1 dollarbuck” coins from the back of a truck.\n\nIn Western Australia, Senator Linda Reynolds’ defamation case against Brittany Higgins continued in the Supreme Court. The former defence minister compared herself to a “punching clown”, saying the unrelenting barrage of press coverage that followed claims she covered up Higgins’ alleged rape took a toll on her and those in her orbit.\n\nIn world news, US Vice President Kamala Harris introduced two-term Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nIn sport news, the Opals will play Serbia in the quarter-finals of the women’s basketball tournament tonight as the Olympic Games continue in France. Follow our live coverage of the Games here.\n\nThanks again for joining us. This is Cassandra Morgan, signing off.\n\nLatest posts\n\n5.36pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nBangladesh interim government set to be finalised as fresh protests break out\n\nBy Ruma Paul and Sudipto Ganguly\n\nBangladesh’s protest leaders expect members of an interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, to be finalised on Wednesday after prime minister Sheikh Hasina quit and fled to India following a violent crackdown on a student-led uprising.\n\nBangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin appointed Yunus as the head of the interim government late on Tuesday, meeting a key demand of students, and said the remaining members needed to be finalised soon to overcome the current crisis, according to a statement from his office.\n\nThe interim government will fill a power vacuum left after Bangladesh’s army chief announced Hasina’s resignation in a televised address on Monday that followed weeks of deadly violence that ripped through the country, killing about 300 people and injuring thousands.\n\nHer resignation triggered jubilation across the country and crowds stormed into her official residence unopposed after she fled, ending a 15-year second stint in power in the country of 170 million that has suffered economic distress in recent years.\n\nLoading\n\nNormality slowly began returning to the country after Monday’s chaos but fresh protests broke out in a Dhaka neighbourhood on Wednesday when hundreds of officials from the central bank forced four of its deputy governors to resign over alleged corruption, Bangladesh Bank sources said.\n\nThe bank did not immediately comment.\n\nGiant neighbour India, which has strong cultural and business ties with Bangladesh, evacuated all non-essential staff and their families from its embassy and four consulates in the country, two Indian government sources said.\n\nMost schools and university campuses in Dhaka and other cities that shut in mid-July due to the protests, reopened while people took buses and other transport to offices and banks. The country’s mainstay garments factories that had been shut for days began opening on Wednesday.\n\nThe interim government is expected to hold elections soon after taking charge, while a spokesperson for Yunus said he would arrive in Dhaka on Thursday after a medical procedure in Paris.\n\nReuters\n\n5.10pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nAustralia joins drills in contested South China Sea\n\nBy Dominic Giannini\n\nAustralia is joining the US, Canada and the Philippines for military exercises in waters contested by China in a first for the four nations’ forces operating together.\n\nA P-8 Poseidon patrol and recon aircraft is being sent by Australia while the other nations are deploying warships and attached aircraft for the exercise, on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nAustralia routinely joins allies such as the US in joint exercises and freedom of navigation patrols through the contested South China Sea.\n\n“The activity will be conducted in a manner that is consistent with international law and with due regard to the safety of navigation and the rights and interests of other states,” the four militaries said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\n“Our four nations reaffirm the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal Award as a final and legally binding decision on the parties to the dispute.”\n\nThe international court ruled China’s claim to the sea had no legal basis, which Beijing rejected.\n\nThere have been repeated clashes between Chinese and Filipino ships in the contested waters, including the Chinese coast guard using water cannons and barging vessels.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Tuesday accused the Philippines of “creating problems in the South China Sea”.\n\n“Certain individuals in the Philippines should stop seeing things in the wrong way and stop making the baseless accusations,” she told a press briefing.\n\n“There has been no problem with regard to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Any narrative that claims otherwise is simply false.”\n\nChina’s embassy in Canberra has been contacted for comment following the announcement of the new exercise.\n\nIt came after Australia’s defence and foreign ministers held high-level talks with their US counterparts and issued expressed concerns about China’s “unsafe and unprofessional encounters” during freedom-of-navigation exercises.\n\nA joint statement after the Australia-United States Ministerial Consultation talks expressed “grave concern about China’s dangerous and escalatory behaviour toward Philippine vessels lawfully operating within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone”.\n\nIt also “reiterated their strong opposition to destabilising or coercive unilateral actions in the maritime domain, including in the South China Sea and East China Sea, that increase tensions and undermine peace and stability”.\n\nAAP\n\n4.45pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nPacific Islanders will soon join ADF ranks under government plan\n\nBy Matthew Knott\n\nNewly elevated cabinet minister Pat Conroy says the federal government wants to move quickly to allow Pacific Islanders to serve in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) as a way to help address the military’s recruitment crisis.\n\nThe government announced in June that it would change eligibility criteria to allow citizens from the Five Eyes nations – New Zealand, Canada, the United States and United Kingdom – to serve in the ADF.\n\nPacific Islanders were left out of the announcement despite enthusiasm for the idea from key regional leaders such as Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister James Marape and Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nConroy, who serves as Minister for the Pacific and Defence Industry, said at a McKell Institute event in Sydney on Wednesday: “I have been very open that we want to see Pacific recruitment into the ADF.\n\n“We want to see that, and we’re working on it right now.”\n\nConroy said the government was still finalising its plan, and that the issue was complicated because the government did not want to deplete Pacific Island nations’ own defence forces.\n\nWhile the Five Eyes recruits are already living in Australia as permanent residents, he said Pacific Islanders would be recruited from their countries.\n\nHe said that allowing Pacific Islanders to enlist would allow, for example, a school-leaver from Papua New Guinea to work as a diesel mechanic with the ADF for several years before returning to their home country with new skills and an Australian military pension.\n\nThe government has loosened eligibility criteria for the military to help address a recruitment shortfall as it tries to boost the number of uniformed personnel by 30 per cent by 2040.\n\nConroy said Pacific Island nations were understandably seeking closer economic ties with China but said it was important that Beijing’s increased presence in the region not “be accompanied by coercion and interference”.\n\n“China should be more transparent in the aid it is giving and should treat infrastructure projects as opportunities for the Pacific to grow local employment, skills and procurement,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4.24pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\n‘Punching clown’: Reynolds claims Higgins ‘pile-on’ took a toll\n\nBy Jesinta Burton\n\nBack again to senator Linda Reynolds’ defamation case against Brittany Higgins unfolding in the WA Supreme Court, and the former defence minister has compared herself to a “punching clown” while detailing the impact of claims she covered up Higgins’ alleged rape.\n\nReynolds told the court the saga and the unrelenting barrage of press coverage that followed – perpetuated by social media posts published by Higgins and her husband David Sharaz – took a toll on her and those in her orbit, including her elderly parents.\n\nLoading\n\n“It was just part of the pile-on,” Reynolds told the court.\n\n“I felt like one of those punching clowns at the fairground – you get punched down and punched down again, and you have to get up smiling.\n\n“They keep reminding the public of the lies about me, the media keep reporting it, and it keeps doing damage to me and the people I love over and over again.”\n\nWhen asked to review a post published by Higgins with a quote that read, “I won’t stay silent so you can stay comfortable”, Reynolds became visibly upset.\n\n“I can assure you that I’m taking these proceedings, putting everything on the line, including my house of 40 years, to be heard and seek some justice,” she told the court.\n\n“I’m not doing this to ‘stay comfortable’. That ain’t comfortable.”\n\nHiggins’ lawyer Rachael Young, SC, will begin cross-examination this afternoon.\n\n4.04pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nIllegal boats seen off WA’s coast for ‘a while’\n\nBy Cassandra Morgan\n\nA traditional owner and Kimberley tourism operator say they led authorities to four illegal fishing boats intercepted off the coast of WA.\n\nDambimangari man Adrian Lane told the ABC he was monitoring mangroves at Kuri Bay, about 370 kilometres north of Broome, on Monday evening when he spotted the first illegal boat.\n\nLane met up with Kimberley tourism operator Peter Tucker and the pair reported the find to border officials, who arrived in the area on Tuesday morning to find another three illegal vessels, the ABC reported.\n\nTucker said he had seen illegal fishing boats in the area for “a while”.\n\n“Border Force have come up here once or twice and have had no luck, and we’ve been a bit frustrated because we continue to see them,” Tucker told the ABC.\n\n“We bump into them, we ring Border Force, nothing happens. But the Australian Navy happened to be in the area, they responded to a call and they … with our assistance, reacted swiftly.”\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher earlier confirmed four illegal boats were intercepted off WA’s coast.\n\nThe Australian Border Force said the Maritime Border Command intercepted a single vessel and, following further inquiries, another three foreign fishing vessels.\n\n3.41pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nQuestacon faces fine after child burnt by plasma globe\n\nBy Kat Wong\n\nA government department could be fined up to $1.5 million after a child caught fire during a visit to a Canberra science institution.\n\nThe nine-year-old was touching a plasma globe when their hands caught alight during a visit to Questacon in July 2022.\n\nThe child had used alcohol-based hand sanitiser provided by Questacon, an investigation by national safety authority Comcare found.\n\nWhen they came into contact with the globe, a spark ignited the hand sanitiser, causing burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nThe Department of Industry, Science and Resources, which oversees Questacon, has been charged with a criminal offence under the Work Health and Safety Act.\n\nThe National Science and Technology Centre could have eliminated risks by removing the plasma globes, limiting their use to trained Questacon workers, warning visitors of the ignition risks or provided non-alcohol-based sanitiser, Comcare found.\n\nThe government department will return to the ACT Magistrates Court on September 12.\n\nQuestacon is one of Canberra’s biggest attractions, drawing more than 500,000 visitors every year including large groups of children on school excursions.\n\nIts galleries are filled with a variety of science exhibits and experiments, from a slide that emulates the weightlessness of space to an earthquake simulator.\n\nPlasma balls are often used in physics demonstrations and create lightning effects when users come into close proximity.\n\nAAP\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3.11pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nAlleged Bluey coin ‘bandit’ due to face court\n\n2.45pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nHiggins’ interview a ‘premeditated and personal’ attack: Reynolds\n\nBy Jesinta Burton\n\nBack in the WA Supreme Court, Liberal Senator Linda Reynolds has detailed the moment she heard a recording of a meeting between former staffer Brittany Higgins, Higgins’ husband David Sharaz and journalist Lisa Wilkinson ahead of Higgins’ tell-all interview on The Project, saying it was the first indication the attack was “premeditated and personal”.\n\nThe recording of the five-hour pre-interview briefing on January 27, 2021 was aired in 2023 during Bruce Lehrmann’s unsuccessful defamation trial against Network Ten and Wilkinson over its segment detailing Higgins’ allegation she was raped in Reynolds’ parliamentary suite and that it was part of a political cover-up.\n\nLehrmann, who was not identified by name in the broadcast, maintains his innocence.\n\nIn the recording, Sharaz was heard recounting how Higgins said “best-case scenario, Linda Reynolds” when asked what she wanted out of going public with her allegation.\n\nWhen Reynolds was asked whether she remembered the moment she heard the recording on Wednesday, she told the court she would remember it until the day she died.\n\n“I heard it during the defamation case and there was extensive reporting of the evidence, including the transcript of a very long pre-interview session done with Lisa Wilkinson,” Reynolds said.\n\n“Until that point, I hadn’t believed there was malice in it, but hearing it [the recording], it was clear it was premeditated and personal against me.\n\n“I had blamed Labor, but I had no idea of just how well-prepared this plan was. They [Higgins and Sharaz] had a package for the media, for the #MeToo movement, a package for disaffected Liberals ... it was premeditated and it was personal.”\n\nBoth Higgins and Sharaz have rejected allegations they were involved in a campaign of harassment via the media.\n\n2.21pm on Aug 7, 2024\n\nWatch: Peter Dutton addresses the media\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton addressed the media in Darwin this afternoon.\n\nWatch what he had to say:\n\nMost Viewed in National\n\nLoading"
