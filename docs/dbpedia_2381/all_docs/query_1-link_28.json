        "text": "Images projected onto some of Canberra’s buildings in the Parliamentary Triangle? On first description, it sounds a bit dorky or tacky – like a public service version of enormous shadow puppets. However, if you’ve even just had a glance at some of the amazing photos coming out of Enlighten Canberra, more accurate descriptors are ‘amazing’, ‘stunning’, ‘gorgeous’ and – simply – ‘wow’.\n\nEnlighten is special enough with the stunning images breathing new life into the building landmarks, there is an extensive Enlighten program with tours and special events, and plenty of the institutions go one better and open up late. While we wait for a darker sky to greet us, we take the opportunity to head into Questacon (normally only open 9am to 5pm). Even though I’m in my mid-20s, I’ve never been (my primary school missed out on the Year 6 Canberra trip that seems to be part of everyone else’s childhood memories!).\n\nQuestacon is normally $23 for adults and $17.50 for kids (under 4 free) but the Enlighten Program had advertised adults prices for the Friday night of 1 March as $10. At the door, we somehow ended up paying $15 each, but it was still a bargain.\n\nWe first stumble across a man walking around in an astronaut suit, and are directed to head up a long, slightly steep ramp which takes us to the top of the building. We’re told that once you reach the top, to enter the first room and then slowly make your way down the building – quite clever. The first exhibition is Deep Oceans, where perhaps the most fascinating thing for me is seeing what happens to Styrofoam heads when they’re put down deep, deep into the ocean (hint: they shrink – a lot!). It’s always humbling to be reminded of how little we know about our world, and our oceans are no exception.\n\nThe Deep Oceans exhibition isn’t as hands on as I’m expecting, but the rest of Questacon feels much more so. I assume it’s just me, but some puzzles or hands-on activities don’t make a lot of sense or have the clearest directions about what they’re trying to achieve (in some cases, they’re very lengthy), but by the same token, plenty of things hold my attention. I can imagine that the creation of the lightning bolt is genuinely exciting for kids, and the house which simulates an earthquake is very well done – and even a little scary.\n\nMy favourite exhibition is the periodic table displayed as a giant glass cage, where the elements each have their own box, and examples of their elements. Very clever, and would have surely made Year 9 science a lot more interesting!\n\nOn the bottom floor of Questacon is a room where there is plenty of fun happening. Pieces of cloth can be fed into what remind of giant vacuum cleaners, sucking the cloth along a twisting maze and then shooting it out at the top for kids to catch. Courageous beings are dropping down a huge slide or getting spun upside down.\n\nTimes goes quickly in Questacon, so we must be having fun. As we step out into the (very) chilly night air, night is certainly on us (it’s well past 9pm). The first view we’re introduced to from Questacon is the National Library. It looks incredible. Electric Canvas (who turn the images into projections) have done an amazing job. I rush to get the camera and the tripod out of the car and awkwardly manoeuvre it for the next 30 minutes. Results follow.\n\nWe could watch the images all night, but it really is cold. We bundle ourselves into the car with promises to return the following night – after quick drive by of the National Gallery, which is showing off its latest exhibition on its walls. Clever. Stunning. Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to capture any photos of the National Gallery. You may want to check out Alan Kerlin’s wonderful photos here.\n\nThe following night I have had the foresight and the time to pull out the box of winter clothes and wrap myself in my jacket and scarf (okay, I find them in the back of my car, discarded from last winter – it didn’t end that long ago!). The first stopping point is far away from where the action is at – across the lake at Russell, off Parkes Way. Plenty of other people have the same idea – the Parliamentary Triangle is lit up beautifully, but it’s difficult to capture.\n\nThe wind hasn’t abated from the night before, so the only real threats to my Enlighten experience is my hair whipping in front of the camera as I take photos, and not being able to stop taking photos. We head again to the National Library – it doesn’t look any less spectacular on the second night, and I find it hard to drag myself away. The party atmosphere even better than the night before, with the band entertaining a large crowd of people well into a cold night (kudos).\n\nBut, there are so many other photos to take! We next find ourselves in the grass in behind King Edward Terrace to take snaps of what must be the longest building (and perhaps the most difficult to project onto): Old Parliament House, or the Museum of Australian Democracy. With the projections it gets graffitied (genuinely looks good) and a projection showing off, well, Enlighten. I think it shows off the most playful projections (to an adult’s mind).\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery is another institution open late – and it’s free. Again, I guiltily admit I’ve never been. And I love it! Like with most galleries, I find the layout a little confusing (have I been here before? How do I get out of this room? Does this room take me back to where I came from?) but the collection is stunning. In particular, Ralph Heimans’ work Glorious – the official portrait of the Queen her diamond jubilee year – is spectacular (his portrait of High Court justice Michael Kirby is also pretty great). We’ve been allowed to carry the camera inside (but no photos), but it is attached to a rather large tripod. The head of security eventually approaches and politely suggests he might put the tripod in the cloakroom for us. Fair enough. The NPG provides fantastic biographical details with each portrait – fascinating trivia and just long enough to hold my attention (a little in contrast to the explanations I saw at Questacon). It seems like the gallery would be a lovely place to visit during lunchtimes, and I’m sorry I haven’t spent more time there.\n\nBy now it’s 11pm and we quietly leave the NPG (tripod retrieved) to admire the building itself. Outside, people are playing ‘Snake the Planet’ – the popular late 90s/early 2000s game ‘snake’ projected in a BIG way onto a wall, and people competing. Love it.\n\nOn another wall there are more projections, which capture something very different to others.\n\nOur final stop is back at Questacon – the most playful projections (for kids). Some of the projections are cartoonish, which I love, cleverly displayed on two sides of the building.\n\nCan’t wait to see it all again this weekend!\n\nAttendees: T1 and Boyfriend (and half of Canberra)\n\nDate: 1 and 2 March, 7.30pm-11pm (it’s on again this weekend, and it’ll be warmer!)\n\nCost: Viewing the projections is free, as is entering most of our institutions open late. Questacon was $15 each (advertised as $10 each).\n\nWorthwhile factor: All projections highly worthwhile (my favourite being the National Library), National Portrait Gallery highly worthwhile, and Questacon worthwhile (from an adult’s perspective only)\n\nWant more? Enlighten Canberra\n\nPostscript 1: I’m very sad to let you know that T2 has finished up as a regular writer on In The Taratory. Her contribution to this blog has been phenomenal and I – and, I’m sure, you! – will miss her writing and her topics."
