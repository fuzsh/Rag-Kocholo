Our most precious resource. If you were in control of Australia’s water, how would you use it? Learn about all things water in this hands-on exhibition that delves into the different ways of using and preserving this precious resource. Have your photo taken and then see it fill up onscreen to show how much water is in your body, move elements like farms, livestock, dams and houses around a model catchment system, or navigate your way around a multimedia house and discover tips and advice to help you save water. Through the lens of science and technology, visitors will gain an appreciation of the properties of water, the phenomena it is involved in, and how important is its sustainable management."
