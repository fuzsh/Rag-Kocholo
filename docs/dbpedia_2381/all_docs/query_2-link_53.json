        "text": "'Wow, that was really cool!,' the Icecreamology 101 audience exclaimed, as a massive cloud of vapour formed. Wearing goggles and gloves, Questacon's Q Lab presenters, Michael Bennett and Daniel McCusker, conducted a series of experiments with liquid nitrogen to reveal 'the science of ice cream and the ice cream of science'.\n\nOf course there were tastings too! The 'icecreamologists' created a range of flavours, including the ever-popular salted caramel, as well as a mind-blowingly-hot-but-delicious chilli-chocolate, and glow-in-the-dark tonic water sorbet. One little person who was seated next to me ate the chilli-choc ice cream with such gusto that his mother was amazed. 'He won't eat my curries, but look at him eating this chilli,' she laughed.\n\nIcecreamology 101 was held at Questacon as part of Canberra's Enlighten Festival in March. Questacon is Australia's National Science and Technology Centre in Canberra and is one of the city's most popular attractions for locals and visitors alike. Each year Australiaâ€™s first and largest interactive science centre reaches over three million people, delivering some six million hours of inspiration through a diverse range of experiences, including:\n\nwithin the iconic Questacon centre in Canberra\n\ntravelling exhibitions that tour to regional and metropolitan galleries and museums across Australia\n\nin-school visits and public exhibitions in regional and remote Australia by touring outreach programs\n\neducational videoconferences and an interactive website\n\ninspiring Australia or National Science Week community events.\n\nShaken, not stirred says 'Professor' Michael...\n\nTasting wasabi, in the name of science...\n\nEnlighten...\n\nEnlighten is an annual festival featuring architectural projections that transform the iconic buildings of Canberra's Parliamentary Triangle. Cultural institutions such as the National Library of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of Australia become tapestries of colour and light. The program of events includes live performances, dining events, exhibitions and tours.\n\nNote: I attended Icreamology 101 as part of the Enlighten Festival, thanks to the generosity of Questacon.\n\nIf you love making ice cream, you might enjoy...\n\nPX Ice cream with raisins\n\nChocolate mint ice cream\n\nTell me, would you eat a spoonful of wasabi in the name of science? And what's your favourite ice cream flavour?"
