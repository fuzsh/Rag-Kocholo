        "text": "Robyn Williams: A long time ago, so far back that you could actually sometimes see pedestrians in Canberra, I went to the old school at Ainslie and witnessed the beginnings of a revolution. It was a collection of boffin boxes, little devices you could play with and learn something about science. The fellow in charge looked like a cross between Mr Chips and David Attenborough, all enthusiasms and insight. The spirit was infectious and since then Mike Gore has won the Eureka Prize, the Order of Australia, and plenty else.\n\nToday he celebrates the 10th birthday of what that experiment in Ainslie became: the National Science and Technology Centre, or Questacon.\n\nMike Gore.\n\nMike Gore: When Bob Hawke lifted the first sod to start construction of Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre, one cold, foggy, sunless May morning in 1986, I was tempted to tell him that the ceremony would not have taken place that day if it hadn't been for the notorious American Senator, Joe McCarthy.\n\nYes, the origins of Questacon go right back to the early '50s, and the American preoccupation at that time of looking for 'Reds under the bed'.\n\nIn parallel with the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, Senator Joe McCarthy ran his own anti-communist witch hunt, the result of which many peoples' lives and careers were turned upside down.\n\nFrank Oppenheimer, brother of J. Robert Oppenheimer, 'the father of the atomic bomb', was caught up in this three-ringed circus. You see, while Frank was a student at Berkeley University he had flirted with the communists on the campus. And all of this came back to haunt him in the 1950s when, because of these un-American activities, he was fired by the University of Minnesota.\n\nWhat he did next is a long story; let me only say that it caused my career to abruptly change directions.\n\nIn 1968, Frank Oppenheimer established in San Francisco, the world's first interactive science centre, The Exploratorium. From then on, interactive science centres began to blossom and flourish all over the world.\n\nBut why have interactive science centres proved so popular?\n\nI believe it's because people can get totally involved. Once they get over the initial surprise of being actively encouraged to use the things on display, they weigh in, and experiment with gusto.\n\nInteractive science centres are places where people can, in almost the words of Ratty, in 'Wind in the Willows', 'mess about with science.' People love trying things out for themselves. They love experimenting. David Attenborough wrote a newspaper article in the late 1970s describing how interactive exhibits were beginning to appear in museums. He talked about a wind of change blowing through their hallowed halls. He told how he'd taken his eight-year-old son to one of London's main museums and introduced the young fellow to many of its major attractions. When they got him home, they asked the boy what he had enjoyed best about the visit and he answered without hesitation, 'The revolving doors.'\n\nI discovered The Exploratorium on a visit to San Francisco in 1975 and was totally blown away by what I saw. On my return to Australia I told everyone who would listen what a wonderfully exciting place I had discovered. At that time I was teaching Physics at the Australian National University.\n\nEventually when I was running out of people to earbash, a friend and colleague, Chris Bryant, the Professor of Zoology at ANU in those days, suggested that I stop talking, and do something!\n\nAs Eliza Doolittle sings in 'My Fair Lady': 'Don't talk of love, show me!' And that's how it all began. In 1979 I had secured a small Federal Government grant to establish a prototype interactive science centre; the ACT Schools Authority had agreed to lend the ANU an old school building to house the project; ANU Council had given their approval for me to establish a science centre for the public, and I'd mustered a bunch of very enthusiastic explainers to run the place.\n\nQuestacon opened in 1980 with a mere ten exhibits, and became the first interactive science centre in the southern hemisphere. The Canberra public took to Questacon in a big way and we were soon inundated with visitors from much further afield than the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nI knew we were on the right track when one day I read an entry in Questacon's Visitors Book where a lady had written: 'I have had my three children in this place for four hours, and during that time they have not asked for food and drink once.'\n\nBecause the initial project funds were pitifully small, building expensive and elaborate exhibits was out of the question. The first exhibits were chosen with simple criteria in mind: they had to be cheap and they had to be simple. No initial cost, no maintenance.\n\nHowever such simplicity bothered me, because I felt that people wouldn't take Questacon seriously if it contained such rudimentary devices. But I needn't have worried, for it soon became clear that the one thing the visitors really loved about Questacon was the simple exhibits.\n\nHaving limited funds, I enlisted from workshops all over Canberra. Eventually there were about 20 workshops engaged in building exhibits for Questacon.\n\nIn the early days, the project was very much a grassroots community effort, and even today a lot of Canberra people still feel personal ownership of Questacon.\n\nQuestacon steadily grew and prospered under the Australian National University's wing, and then in 1982, The Australian Bicentennial Authority appeared on the scene. What happened next was rather like those wonderful Yes, Minister scenarios.\n\nIn quick succession, it was decided that Australia should have an interactive science centre in time for the 1988 celebrations and I was drafted into the Department of Science under Barry Jones. My task was to write the submission to Federal Cabinet and later to help compile an architect's brief for the new building.\n\nBy 1986 all systems were Go. Barry Jones got Federal Cabinet to agree to the proposal, and the Japanese nation had agreed to donate $10-million, half the capital cost of the building.\n\nThe construction of the new building began in 1986 and it was completed on schedule and within budget in September 1988. Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre, was formally opened by the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, on 23rd November, 1988.\n\nPerhaps the most important and impressive aspect of Questacon is that its programs now reach out all over Australia. Let me tell you how this came about.\n\nAs the number of visitors to Questacon soared, I introduced a number of short demonstration shows rather like those Julius Sumner Miller used to do.\n\nThe young ANU undergraduate Explainers, (I called them spruikers) took to this activity with great enthusiasm, and it was staggering how much and how quickly it improved and developed their confidence and communication skills.\n\nIn 1985 a travelling version of Questacon was established and the science circus took to the road for the first time in an old furniture van with a handful of exhibits, props for some science shows, and a dozen young ANU spruikers who ran the whole show.\n\nBy 1988, this first travelling component of Questacon had attracted major financial support and The Shell Questacon Science Circus was born.\n\nThe success of introducing science students to the challenges of communicating science to the public led to the ANU establishing a one-year post graduate course in science communication, and offering 15 scholarships each year to science graduates from all over Australia.\n\nThis unique course concentrates on developing practical skills, with Questacon providing the laboratory component. The Shell Questacon Science Circus enables students to practice their skills on the public all over the country. I consider the program to be a scientific version of NIDA, the National Institute of the Dramatic Arts.\n\nANU has been quick to appreciate the importance of the emerging field of science communication. It recently established a national Centre for the Public Awareness of Science, CPAS, which as well as training the science circus team, now offers undergraduate, masters and doctoral courses in science communication.\n\nA major challenge for Questacon right from the start, has been funding. The centre has attracted, on average, $1-million a year in sponsorship for the first ten years of its existence. I believe that few other cultural institutions can boast this achievement.\n\nWithout the support of organisations like Shell, IBM, ORICA, NRMA, BHP and a host of others, we would not have been able to achieve what we have.\n\nAnother challenge for Questacon is that it is required to generate half its annual budget. As far as I know, it is the only national cultural institution which is given this challenge. It costs around $10-million a year to run the centre, half of which comes in appropriation from the Federal Government and the other half we generate ourselves.\n\nLooking back it is staggering to realise just how much Questacon has achieved in its first decade. We have strived to be a really truly national science centre, and I believe that we have achieved this goal in a number of ways.\n\nThe average number of people we reach each year in Canberra, around Australia and now overseas, is over one-million. There is no other science centre in the world I believe, that covers such a vast territory as does Questacon.\n\nWith the help of our sponsors we've built interactive exhibitions which we've toured all over Australia. We've run professional development workshops for teachers on numerous topics, including how to get more interactivity into the classroom. How often I hear visitors to Questacon sigh and say, 'Oh how I wish something like this had been around when I was at school.'\n\nWe've taken portable planetariums to the remote regions of Australia; run hands-on, minds-on workshops for teachers and students; and established the Questacon Maths Centre as a major travelling program.\n\nIn 1991 a meeting at Questacon of the heads of Australian interactive science centres formed the Australasian Science and Technology Exhibitors Network, ASTEN. This organisation now promotes collaboration between all Australian and New Zealand science centres.\n\nOn the international scene we've toured exhibitions throughout South East Asia, and recently an interactive exhibition called Science On The Move was seen by 60,000 people in nine Pacific countries, including the Solomon Islands, Kirabas, the Marshall Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Cook Islands.\n\nOne student in the Solomon Islands commented that the exhibition beat watching soccer on TV. High praise indeed!\n\nQuestacon has been represented at all the major science festivals around the world, including Edinburgh, Dunedin, Grahamstown in South Africa, Orkney and naturally the Australian Science Festival in Canberra.\n\nQuestacon is particularly proud of the fact that with the help of the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the young members of the science circus team have made many visits to remote Aboriginal communities.\n\nA question I often hear is, 'Yes, it's all very exciting, but what do people actually learn in a science centre?' My response to that is that interactive science centres are not about teaching specific scientific facts. They are not, and were never intended to be, formal science teaching institutions.\n\nRecent research has revealed that learning does take place in interactive science centres but the learning is informal, quite different from that which takes place in a formal science curriculum. Just as art galleries are not about learning how to paint, science centres are not about providing a formal science curriculum. Both I believe, are about providing a cultural experience.\n\nExploratorium's Frank Oppenheimer once said, 'Nobody flunks a science centre!'\n\nAs we celebrate our tenth anniversary we are already looking forward to the next ten years. We can expect that the technology advances will accelerate in the next decade as a result of which Questacon will be taking its messages to the Australian public in very different ways ten years hence.\n\nIn the next decade, the success of what we do will depend on continuing to create new ways for people to experience the fascination of science and its relevance to our everyday lives.\n\nJust as Vegemite, Victa and Violet Crumble have become true blue Aussie icons, so the name Questacon will need to become as familiar as Quintex and Qantas, but for very different reasons!\n\nRobyn Williams: I wonder what he means? Happy 10th birthday to Dr Mike Gore, father of Questacon; long may it flourish.\n\nNext week we celebrate a creature: Lowly Worm, which, it transpires, is not so lowly any more, and may indeed stop our cities and oceans from drowning in excrement. I'm Robyn Williams."
