        "text": "Join me in exploring the world of Art Avatar! Through this exhibition series, we aim to create a unique visual and aesthetic experience that introduces the public to new readings of visual knowledge and multi-surface strategies in production. For the past 25 years, I have been working on the ideas of Art Interfaces, thinking about coding and programs. The goal is to build cultural value into every situation, making it both sustainable and ethical, while still involving play, learning, and sensory experience. Virtuality is the key to all historical, social, and cultural conceptions, and with the emergence of VR, AR, and MR technologies, it is more important than ever to recognize this. As Duchamp articulated, we must identify and believe in virtual constructs for them to exist. In the realm of performance art, the engagement of the body and movement encourages play, allowing art to happen as a Gestalt experience. Join us in exploring the intersection of technology and art, and discover the past that gives us the platform to understand why we have developed new tools. https://lnkd.in/dMD8EdtW\n\nFuture of Museum Guides? Only with #Metahuman & #AI! We created this digital guide for the Museum of ≈†koda Auto. The interactive Metahuman character explains interesting facts about the museum and exhibits, then he tests you on it. If you succeed you get the digital reward! Let me know if you would like to have your own guide! Let's connect and explore the Immersive World together with YORD This post is part of the Future of Immersive Tech series. Check out my profile & üîî for more! Always happy for üîÅ , üí¨ or üëç ! #museum #ue5 #futuretech\n\nWhat if museum exhibits could come to life right before your eyes? Let's talk about augmented reality in museums! Augmented reality (AR) transforms how we see art and history. Just point your phone, and watch history or paintings move. It‚Äôs like magic üßü‚ôÄÔ∏è Why is this cool? Because it makes learning super interactive and fun. You're not just looking at an old vase; you‚Äôre seeing how it was used daily centuries ago! So, what do you think? Can AR change our museum trips into thrilling adventures? If you‚Äôre into AR tech, let‚Äôs connect! Your innovation could be featured next. Follow Prisca Ekhaguere, CSc for more peeks into how tech is changing our cultural experiences. #AugmentedReality #MuseumTech #ArtTech #TechAdvocate #TechEnthusiast #Technology #TechAdvancements #Episode71 #EmergingTechnologySeries2024\n\n[OPEN CALL] >> The ‚ÄúShifting Cosmologies: More Than Human XR‚Äù track is part of the upcoming Politics of the Machines (POM) conference in Aachen in April 2024. Shifting Cosmologies: More Than Human XR track instigates a discursive conversation about reality media and the machines and technologies that define it. In the present reality we live in today, crises are marked by tensions between the interpersonal, socio-political, local, and global. These entanglements are often complex and range from the micro to macro scale, circumscribed by human and other-than-human agents and their place in a largely anthropocentric system. From this built-in anthropocentric bias evolves outcomes and scenarios with real and perceived calamities manifesting in complex problems that are seemingly unresolvable. Within this context, we consider how Extended Reality may be used as a theoretical framework and navigational toolkit to facilitate the social dreaming of alternate futures in reimagining our shifting cosmologies. In doing so, we pivot from an anthropocentric reality to one encompassing ecocentrism worlds beyond the human experience. By gazing back at the human from the viewpoint of the other, we uncover new perspectives. This track calls on researchers, practitioners, and scholars to consider reality media within the digital sphere, biosphere, ecosphere, and geosphere to critique the limitations of current XR technologies and practices. We seek novel interventions within reality media that present actionable approaches to non-anthropocentric utopias through (1) papers, (2) workshops, and (3) hybrid presentations that embrace XR technology for knowledge creation and transfer. Through the track, we incite ideas and concepts that can be developed into guides toward a future all-inclusive and ethical practice of immersive technology.

We aim to generate sustained conversations about non-human-centric XR at the intersection of philosophy, creative practice, sciences, and technology.

SHIFTING COSMOLOGIES IV: MORE THAN HUMAN XR (ONLINE EVENT) The fourth XR lunch event in the Shifting Cosmologies series is an online lecture by John (Iannis) Bardakos. 7 DEC 2023 - 11:00 TO 12:30 (Central European Time) Location: Duke Kunshan University: CC Performance Cafe ZOOM: 936-1095-9568 / PASSWORD: SHIFTING John (Iannis) Bardakos‚Äô lecture for the XR lunch event Shifting Cosmologies IV: More Than Human XR is entitled ‚ÄúProcesses from Transformations: Techno-Alchemic Journeys from Spaces, Places, and Topoi‚Äù. This presentation explores the shift from spaces to significant places via techno-alchemy in virtuality, emphasizing ‚ÄòProcess‚Äô over ‚ÄòObject‚Äô. It delves into the interplay of noetic, social, virtual, and Newtonian topologies in redefining aesthetic experiences. The concept of ‚Äòtechno-alchemy‚Äô is central, transforming space perception into places imbued with meaning, merging virtual and augmented realities with the physical, creating new hybrid topologies. This approach contrasts traditional space-place notions, focusing on ‚ÄòProcess‚Äô, and prioritizing experiential journeys and interactions over final outcomes. These processes elevate aesthetic experiences beyond the physical to intellectual, emotional, and spiritual realms, fostering a deeper connection between observer and observed. The presentation concludes by envisioning virtuality as a catalyst for a new understanding of the world, reshaping interactions and experiences, transitioning from Newtonian space concepts to places as resonant emotional and intellectual landscapes, with a pronounced emphasis on the experiential process. Shifting Cosmologies: More Than Human XR is a series of presentations and interviews that instigates a discursive conversation about XR technologies and their place in our default anthropocentric world. We consider how XR technology may be used as a theoretical framework and navigational toolkit to reimagine our shifting cosmologies from an anthropocentric reality to one encompassing ecocentrism realities beyond the human experience. We see this as a first step in generating sustained conversations about non-human centric XR and the intersection with the areas of philosophy, critical theory, and creative practice in collaboration with the humanities, sciences, and technology in the future. Shifting Cosmologies: More Than Human XR is organized by the XResearch Cluster, a collaborative research cluster between V2_Lab for the Unstable Media and the Design, Technology, and Radical Media Lab. https://lnkd.in/gtA8Xrcc"
