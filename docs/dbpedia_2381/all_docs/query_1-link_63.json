        "text": "Two new exhibitions from Questacon have landed at Tasmania’s Queen Victoria Museum in Inveresk, offering hours of interactive fun for the whole family.\n\nThe new Science on the Move and Fascinating Science exhibitions are free to enter and feature hands-on activities.\n\nIn the Science on the Move exhibition, visitors can explore the beloved STEAM Gallery and discover principles of light, music and sound, human biology and health, force and motion, ecology and the environment, and electricity and magnetism.\n\nFamilies can turn themselves into a battery, crank up a tornado in a bottle, escape from handcuffs, predict the outcome of chaos, build a food chain and more.\n\nThe Fascinating Science exhibition delves into everyday scientific principles and problem-solving puzzles.\n\nThere are three zones to explore: the Puzzlequest Zone with logic and spatial puzzles, the Eyes On and Perception Zone with visual illusions and human perception, and the Forces Zone with forces like magnetism, friction, gravity and spinning.\n\n“The great thing about both of these touring exhibitions from Questacon is that there’s something for all ages to interact with,” Launceston Mayor Matthew Garwood said.\n\n“Having two exhibitions on offer means kids (and adults) will be able to visit time and time again, while finding something new to explore through each visit.”\n\nFascinating Science is on display until August 18th, 2024, and Science on the Move until March 16th, 2025."
