        "text": "Robyn Williams: Well, you may have spotted that we have a geological theme in today's Science Show and an underlying message of getting the ideas across, and that's what Graham Durant represents, he has been running Questacon for the last couple of decades and is about to leave. After the Scott and Stopes story, you'll know that geology is rarely an easy exercise.\n\nGraham Durant: Right, so Robyn, I went to the University College of Wales Aberystwyth where I did my undergraduate degree in geology and then stayed on to do a PhD. My PhD work at the University of Wales involved studying an underwater igneous complex, part of the tertiary igneous province of north-west Britain. And this particular complex had been eroded and sunk underwater, so we had to learn to dive for it. It was shown up firstly by the geophysical work, so the aeromagnetic and the aerogravity survey showed that there was a pretty dense cylinder of rock there, and it had the same characteristics as the better-known Hebridean igneous complexes such as Skye or Rum or Mull.\n\nSo I was very excited, we went out there, and of course when you go onto the continental shelf, you are away out of the sight of land, and this was in the 1970s, so we didn't have GPS or anything, so the first problem is to actually work out where you are, and that's quite difficult. And of course then you have moving bodies of water and currents and the boat moving in different directions, so getting a reference point on the seabed is also difficult because if you are cruising at 30 knots into a 30-knot current, you are effectively standing still over the seabed and your echosounder trace gives you a big plateau.\n\nAnyway, we went there, we did the work, we tried sampling it using dredges and things and realised that we were going to have to learn to dive to go down and collect the samples. So, the next part of my work was really learning how to dive. That was really interesting in its own right because I've always loved the ocean, I love water, but in the 1970s health and safety wasn't quite the same as it is today, and I did have one near-death experience when we got stuck in the water for a couple of hours and had to be rescued by a lifeboat when we were learning to dive, but we got through that. And I just had the most wonderful time cruising around the Hebrides, collecting rock samples from the islands, diving to collect the rock samples and then of course taking them back to the lab for all the geochemical work and the petrological studies. It was a great privilege.\n\nNow, having said that, I also learnt very early on in my PhD work that I suffered badly from seasickness, and my first big cruise was just before my wedding, and we were at sea for about six weeks in total and I came back as this emaciated wreck. My wife was very tempted to throw me back and see if she could get a better catch.\n\nRobyn Williams: It's very interesting, isn't it, because the life you describe is so different from what the conventional view of a geologist might be, you know, wandering around picking up rocks here and there for weeks on end. What you've described is being out in the world, right in the maw of nature, experiencing so many things at once just like real sciences in the real world out in nature, so I'm not terribly surprised that when you went to Scotland, to Glasgow to continue your work, you were inspired by the communication of science and showing its many facets. Is that right? Is that a good assumption?\n\nGraham Durant: Yes, again, there's a little bit of a progression. So I finished my PhD work in Wales, and as you do as a postgraduate student you start looking around for work, and I could have ended up setting up a geochemical lab in Africa or mapping sands and gravels, but I managed to secure a one-year research assistantship at the University of Glasgow in the Hunterian Museum, it's a very famous museum. I had the job of looking after the rock and mineral collections and teaching, doing research, doing exhibition work, and university outreach. And all that really started my progression from marine geology towards science communication, and progressively I realised I really enjoyed talking to people about science. I was able to get out into the communities around Scotland, talking about geology. So in 1994 I remember I had the privilege of being a Royal Society of Edinburgh children's lecturer, talking about atmospheric climate change and going into schools up in Drumnadrochit and places, and doing a mix of science show and narrative and talk.\n\nAnd also I learnt how to develop exhibitions because part of our work was communicating the content of the museum to the public, and that exhibition work I found fascinating because it's taking sometimes quite complicated ideas and turning them into a narrative supported by objects that the public can enjoy. More and more of my time was focused on science communication at a time when, I have to say, it was not fashionable to be a science communicator. So we are talking now…you know, we are into the '80s, and in the UK people were just starting to wake up to the fact that science had a relationship to society and that that had to be nourished, and not only for a future supply of school students going into science but also for public understanding. The issues around science were starting to crop up and emerge more and more, so that narrative between science and society became increasingly important.\n\nRobyn Williams: And so Questacon called. Here was a national science technology centre that had started in Ainslie School led by Mike Gore, a very enthusiastic teacher and academic at the ANU teaching physics, and you arrived in this wonderful…had you been to Australia before, when you came to Canberra?\n\nGraham Durant: Yes, I had. And again, there's a bit of an interesting story, I met Mike first of all in Edinburgh at the Edinburgh International Science Festival. I was doing some big science demonstrations that I used to do in Glasgow at a conference and Mike was in the audience and we met and started talking. And that was really the first time I became aware of Questacon.\n\nI then was lucky enough to get an Association of Commonwealth Universities bursary to come over to Australia in 1996 to catch up with the Science Circus, I was at that point studying the relationship between universities and science centres because we were developing the idea for the Glasgow Science Centre. So I came over, I visited, went and studied in Scitech, went into Perth to investigate, to Melbourne, down in the Mornington Peninsula to catch up with the Science Circus, the class of 1996, and then up to Canberra. And then back home and got on with the business of setting up the Glasgow Science Centre which opened in 2001.\n\nI was then able to come back to Canberra in 2002 when Questacon was hosting the Science Centre World Congress and I came over as a delegate, from India as it happened, and I was terribly ill in India having picked up a stomach bug and they lost my bags, so I arrived in a pretty dishevelled state into Canberra in 2002, little expecting that I would be ending up here, so back to the university. And then one day I got a phone call; would I be interested in coming to Australia? And my wife and I sort of looked at each other, my sons had finished school, one was at university, and we didn't have any impediments in terms of elderly relatives to hold us back, so we decided on an adventure.\n\nRobyn Williams: Has it been an adventure, has it really?\n\nGraham Durant: Look, it has been terrific. We came over…it's a short-term contract initially, and so we really threw ourselves into Australia and visiting and doing everything that people do and we went everywhere and took every advantage of things, not expecting that this would be drawn out into a 19-year career, but of course it has. And it has been wonderful. It was a leap of faith at the time, coming from an academic environment to a public service environment, it worked out very well and I'm just blessed that I've had the opportunity to work with so many creative people, passionate people, and that has been a joy.\n\nRobyn Williams: Lots of people imagine Questacon the new building, and of course you are on the road as well, in other words not just you personally but your explainers, they are out there, and bringing science to wherever people really want it. And you are also looking for new space because Questacon the building was never quite big enough. So what's the state of things now in 2022?\n\nGraham Durant: So we are back on the road again after Covid, doing face-to-face activities, but of course we've learnt the lesson that one has to do a little bit more with digital communication, which we had to during the Covid pandemic, so we are developing hybrid models for getting out into communities and having those experiences that help people, give them a bit of a nudge towards science, technology and general interest, as well as young school students and teachers, supporting them in their work.\n\nSo we are back on the road. The Science Circus is still going out and delivering programs into regional and remote communities. But we've also got other programs on engineering and cybersecurity, innovation programs that go out from Canberra, and indeed internationally. We do a lot with foreign affairs and trade and we have a science diplomacy stream on callout.\n\nBut in the centre, this building was originally designed to be extended. The architect Lawrence Neal always recognised it wasn't going to be big enough, and has developed up plans for an extended building. So we live in hope that one day we will get the extra gallery space and another big lecture theatre where we can really showcase some of the great science innovation that's going on in Australia.\n\nSo we are working very much with our national footprint to extend our work as far as we can, and obviously developing Questacon in Canberra as part of the national story, science and technology in the parliamentary zone in the national capital, it's very important. We would like to see that story expanded. So we are surrounded by wonderful institutions that, I have to say, tend to be looking backwards into history for their core content. We want to be looking forward into the future because it's going to be a terrific future, it's going to be disruptive, it's going to be challenging, but there are wonderful opportunities, it's a great time to be alive on planet Earth for a whole range of things that are going to be coming our way the rest of this century, some difficult, some amazing. You know, we're going to be on Mars, we're going to have all sorts of medical technologies, quantum AI. Those transitions are coming our way fast. Part of our role is really to help the public understand some of these things. As a national institution we want to tell the stories of what is happening, what the issues are, what we can do, what individuals and families can do to work towards some of these planetary scale solutions.\n\nRobyn Williams: Well, of course that's one of the paradoxes; a very, very exciting future, and a lot of the population, we both meet them all the time, the young people who are looking to the future and think it's absolutely terrific, yet on the other hand there is the record of science in schools and the struggle for young scientists. You don't have to be wanting to be a scientist to do science of course, but if you do choose to do science, the struggle of trying to get your first contract…how would you assess the paradox of this, of the enthusiasm for science in some quarters and the steady drop in attainment in schools and such like, this tension? What's going on?\n\nGraham Durant: Well, my personal view is that although we've got some terrific teachers and fabulous pupils, schools alone are not the answer to the dilemma. Young people are only in school for a number of years of their life, and most people spend most of their lives outside the classroom. When they are in the classroom for 30 weeks a year, five hours a day, they might do one hour of science and technology, so there is clearly not enough going on there, so what we have to do is find a much better way of integrating all of the wonderful opportunities in the broader community, the museums, the science centres, on the web, botanic gardens, integrate those better with what's going on in schools to support teachers. We've still got a situation where many teachers are uncomfortable with teaching science. A lot of them have only learnt a bit of science in their own career from their own school that was taught badly historically. So we've got to work with teachers because they are great multipliers and very, very important.\n\nBut we've also got to find ways that we can better stitch together what's going on outside the classroom with what's going on inside the classroom, and that has to be community specific because what works in Wagga won't work in Hobart because you've got different opportunities around there. So we need teachers to be looking outside the classroom for those opportunities and they need to be encouraged to do that.\n\nAt the same time, curriculum is just still full, and even with a new curriculum the opportunities for developing creativity and imagination, all the things that are critically important for the workplace of the future, are still not manifested as much as they should be in the schools. There are good schools, the leafy green suburbs are probably full of wonderful schools, well resourced, but a lot of schools don't have that opportunity, and the further you get away from the metropolitan areas, the greater the challenges are and the greater the support those teachers might need."
