Learn how Australia's remote mining expertise will help drive the next phase of human spaceflight to the moon, Mars and beyond.\n\nDeveloped by Questacon, this exhibition is designed to welcome space enthusiasts and newcomers alike, getting all visitors on board with Australia's vision for a vibrant and diverse space sector.\n\nAt Australia in Space, the sky is no longer the limit.\n\nGroup bookings available for schools and OOSH Centres.\n\nIf you or your children would like to see the exhibition but can feel overwhelmed by crowds or noise, you can attend our Australia in Space: Low-Sensory Sessions.\n\nVisitors can purchase tickets on arrival at the Museum for all sessions.\n\nAustralia in Space is divided into three zones, each exploring a different realm of Australian space operations and expertise.\n\nLift Off\n\nDiscover what Australia is sending to space, and how we do it. Be inspired by cutting-edge Australian aerospace propulsion systems and explore the effects of atmospheric drag on objects as they travel to space and return to Earth. An airport-inspired ‘Earth departures board’ will amaze you with the frequency of rocket launches around the world. Discover iconic satellites around us right now, and design your own spacesuit to explore the surface of the Moon.\n\nIn Orbit\n\nExplore the many challenges of operating in orbit, and Australian innovations that take advantage of the opportunities in space. Uncover how living in space impacts the human body, and how space habitats are designed for their occupants. Be surprised by the difficulties that space imposes on even the most mundane tasks, and take a photo as if you were on a space station orbiting above Australia. Mount payloads into a model satellite to uncover Australia’s expertise in small-sat engineering, and marvel at the sheer number of objects in orbit around Earth in an exploration of all the stuff in space.\n\nEarth & Beyond"
