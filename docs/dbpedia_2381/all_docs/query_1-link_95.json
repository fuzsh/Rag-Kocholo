        "text": "Morning everyone.\n\nWednesday will go down as one of the greatest days in Australia’s Olympics history, as Matt Wearn, Keegan Palmer, the men’s track cycling pursuit team and Nina Kennedy all won gold. The six-medal haul (including two bronze) was easily Australia’s best for a single Olympic day – and it took the team to a total of 18 gold medals, 12 silvers and 11 bronze, a total of 41 and the best return in the country’s history.\n\nOver the Channel, police are out in huge numbers across England to try to contain expected disorder from up to 100 far-right protests.\n\nAnd our top story back home is that the New South Wales waste industry is under further scrutiny after new tests found widespread contamination of recycled soil products.\n\nAustralia\n\nGolden day | It’s been yet another sensational day for Australia at the Paris Olympics, capped by Nina Kennedy, who won the women’s pole vault in front of 80,000 people at the Stade de France with a leap of 4.90m. Earlier, Australia’s men won gold in the cycling team pursuit overnight by beating Team GB in an exciting final. Keegan Palmer retained his champion status in the men’s skateboarding park (pictured) while another Tokyo gold medallist, sailor Matt Wearn, also proved unbeatable again as he defended his men’s dinghy title in Marseille. Plus the Opals avenged the Boomers’ defeat by beating Serbia to reach the semi-finals of the basketball.\n\nExclusive | The New South Wales environment watchdog has vowed to crack down on the waste industry after tests found asbestos at seven of 13 facilities producing or handling cheap landscaping products. A Guardian Australia investigation revealed earlier this year that similar tests in 2013 and 2019 found potentially contaminated products had been distributed across the state.\n\nPay boost | Early childhood education workers will receive a 15% pay increase as the Albanese government fulfils one of its key election pledges – but only if centres agree to limit fee increases.\n\n‘Existential threat’ | Ocean temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef are now the hottest in at least 400 years and are an “existential threat” to the planet’s unique natural wonder, according to new scientific research.\n\nBody image | Watching less than 10 minutes of videos on TikTok can negatively impact a woman’s body image, a new study has found, as experts call for stricter regulation of harmful content on social media.\n\nWorld\n\nUK disorder | UK police forces are staging their biggest mobilisation for more than a decade to face down dozens of gatherings led by the far right on Wednesday evening although counter-protesters are out in force as well such as in Walthamstow (pictured). Follow the developments live here and we also have a guide to the far-right groups and figures behind the violence.\n\nBattleground US | Long lines are forming in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, before Kamala Harris and Tim Walz’s much-anticipated rally later today as their campaign for votes in swing states continues. Follow developments live here.\n\nKursk incursion | Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region has continued into a second day, prompting Vladimir Putin to convene a meeting with his top defence and law enforcement officials.\n\n$50m Titanic suit | The family of a French explorer who died in a submersible implosion has filed a wrongful death lawsuit seeking more than $50m that accuses the sub’s operator of gross negligence.\n\n‘London zoo’ | Banksy has revealed his third animal-themed artwork in London since Monday, this time showcasing a trio of monkeys swinging across the rail bridge over Brick Lane in east London.\n\nFull Story\n\nInside Lebanon as war looms\n\nNour Haydar speaks to two reporters in Beiruit about what it’s like living in Lebanon as the prospect of a full-scale Middle East war increases.\n\nIn-depth\n\nTwo years ago a young girl won a skateboarding competition at a venue on the Sunshine Coast. Yesterday that girl, Arisa Trew, became an Olympic champion and could help to build on surging interest from other young girls who want to emulate her. In Sydney, skate coaches are already reporting increased demand for lessons and one aspiring skater, Charlotte Ives (pictured), tells Rafqa Touma about getting the bug. “When you see someone at the skate park, and they can do something you can’t do, it is very inspiring to think ‘maybe I should try that’.”\n\nNot the news\n\nSteaming is one of the world’s oldest “gentle” cooking methods, writes Alice Zaslavsky, who riffs about a Chinese recipe for white-cut chicken with steamed rice, sizzled spring onions and cucumber whack, which she was inspired to create after seeing a reel on Instagram.\n\nThe world of sport\n\nOlympics | Australian hockey player Tom Craig has apologised for making “a terrible mistake” after being arrested and spending a night in a police station for allegedly trying to buy cocaine on the streets.\n\nWrestling | India’s Olympic contingent are devastated after star female wrestler Vinesh Phogat was disqualified hours before her gold medal match for exceeding the 50kg restriction by just 100g despite even cutting off her hair.\n\nFootball | Manchester United do not plan to demolish Old Trafford if they build a new stadium and would instead scale down the famous ground for use by the women’s team and academy.\n\nMedia roundup\n\nA dramatic drop in international students would push Australia’s economy into a recession, a leading economist has told the Sydney Morning Herald. The South Australian government hopes to raise more than $1m from the sale of the “lucky” number 8 car rego plate, the Advertiser reports.\n\nWhat’s happening today\n\nEconomy | RBA governor Michele Bullock delivers annual Rotary lecture in Armidale.\n\nMedia | Kate McClymont delivers Caroline Jones oration for Women in Media.\n\nArts | Archibald prize, people’s choice award winner announced.\n\nSign up\n\nIf you would like to receive this Morning Mail update to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here, or finish your day with our Afternoon Update newsletter.
