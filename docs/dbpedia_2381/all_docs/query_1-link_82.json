        "text": "A week ago, we went to Questacon with Uncle Joshua, Aunty Natalie, Charlotte, Genevieve and Freddy. Questacon in the National Science Centre. It has 8 galleries, but when we were there, Gallery 1 and 8 were closed.\n\nGallery 2 was called Wonderworks. There was an egg machine that moved eggs in cycles. There was a screen that videoed you and then it transferred you into a different, colourful movie. There was a harmonograph (a sheet of stone that is hung from the roof with wire that you psh to make it swing in circles. You then place a piece of paper on the stone. After that you attach pens to long planks and then set them down on the paper where the stone swinging makes the pens draw really cool shapes) and I got a picture drawn for me. There is a wall where you stand and a light flashes and your shadow stays on the wall. There is an Ames Room where you “grow and shrink.” In reality you just go into corners.\n\nIn Gallery 3 you learned about the earth. The gallery was caled Awesome Earth and there was caged lightning, pretend earthquakes, a broken tornado maker and more!\n\nIn Gallery 4 was called Q Lab. It was where you tested stuff out (e.g. we had to let a ball free-fall down a slide then fly through hoops. You had to adjust the hoops) and where the Spectacular Science Shows are held and there are puzzles to work out.\n\nGallery 5 was a multi-purpose space. When we were there, it was a puzzles room, full of tables with puzzles and experiments resting on them.\n\nI didn’t go into Gallery 6, Mini Q, but I did go into Gallery 7, Excite@Q. It was probably my favourite. You can free-fall down a vertical slide (that was kind of scary), check your heartbeat by holding onto a metal bar and watch the kick-drum beat out your heartbeat, let a tube suck up a piece of cloth, follw it, then catch it as the tube spits it out, make music with light, hit buttons to test your reflexes, control a wheel as it rolls along a tightrope or play air hockey with a robot.\n\nby Neave Johanson"
