        "text": "Looking to launch into product development, Questacon required a series of images that would create a cohesive visual merchandising story. The products were to have commercial appeal and engage with their target market, which consisted of a wide spectrum of ages.\n\nTo mark this special occasion, we developed a series of illustrations with glow-in-the-dark variations. Starring an astronaut, a rocket and the moon itself, the designs could be easily applied across marketing, products, merchandise and souvenirs.\n\nThe hand-drawn style used channelled a level of quirk and fun that would appeal to a wide demographic. The inclusion of Australia’s outline in the rocket image portrayed a sense of pride for the country’s involvement in this historic event."
