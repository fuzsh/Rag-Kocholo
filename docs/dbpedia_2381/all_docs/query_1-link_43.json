There is so much to see, experience, learn about and enjoy! We loved our visit when we headed there mid July!\n\nWhen we first visited Canberra, it was during a public holiday and we arrived at 11am and quickly realised there was no way we would get in with the massive queues so when we recently went back to Canberra we headed there as soon as the center opened at 9am. We grabbed our Mini Q session tickets straight away before they were gone and headed inside.\n\nMini Q is a custom built space especially designed for kids 0 to 6 years old and we were so glad we managed to visit the space as the kids loved it! Mini Q had timed sessions in place when we visited which meant the space was not over crowded and from memory we were allowed for 45 minutes which was great but hard to explain the kids to leave.\n\nOnce we visited Mini Q, we went onto checking out the rest of Questacon. Levels after levels where kids can explore, discover, learn from and see. The areas were busy however the centre is quite large so it was manageable and the kids were still able to touch the experiments, play in the Q Lab which is suited for visitors aged 7 or more but still interesting to watch and try it. Kids and adults will be engaged with science with over 200 hands-on exhibits in eight interactive galleries and outdoor Science Garden experiences."
