Questacon â€“ the National Science and Technology Centre, is located on the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. It is a large centre with more than 200 interactive exhibits relating to science and technology.

The centre is split up into seven galleries on different floors, accessed by a spiral ramp around the 'drum'. As of November 2009, the seven galleries are:

- Terrorsaurus with anamatronic dinosaurs.

- Sideshow, perhaps the most popular exhibition, looking at the science of the circus. Several popular exhibits include Free Fall, a giant slide with a six metre and seventy centimetre drop, and Track Attack, a simulated roller coaster.

- MiniQ, an exhibition designed for children between the ages of 0 and 6. Exhibits include a water play area, a sensory space, and a quiet area.

- Wonderworks, looking at light and sound. The exhibitions features displays on Polarised light, Fresnel lenses, and holograms.

- Awesome Earth, looking at natural disasters and geology. Features a Tesla coil and an earthquake simulator.

- Perception Deception explores how your brain can mix up what you see and hear.

- Measure Island, makes measurement adventurous and fun.

The galleries are staffed by paid staff, as well as a team of about 60 volunteers. The volunteers occasionally will make use of Discovery Trolleys, featuring smaller, hands-on exhibits related to the gallery.

The Centre also features a number of performance spaces, used for presentations for general public and student audiences by Questacon's in-house theatre troupe, the Excited Particles. The Excited Particles also perform puppet shows for young children and more serious talks on science and current events.
