The events coincided with the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, or Vatican II. Garabandal is the only Marian apparition event to have prophesied and commented on Vatican II. Nevertheless, in Christendom, travelling to Garabandal is regarded as an alternative pilgrimage.The pilgrimage route is in several ways unique compared to journeys to other Marian pilgrimage shrines, since it has not yet been approved by the Catholic Church. Pilgrimages to Garabandal were even officially forbidden for several years. The Catholic Church authorities originally declared travelling to Garabandal as forbidden for church officials such as priests and others. This article gives an overview of the case of Garabandal through the years and reflect upon why this place is considered special in comparison to other pilgrimage sites. The study examines such aspects of pilgrimages to this village as location and motivation, the Virgin Mary and Marian apparitions and also the messages and miracles of Garabandal.\n\nIbsen's mermaid in China: adapting The lady from the sea for the traditional Yue theatre\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTerry Siu-han Yip\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Ibsen has created Ellida Wangel in The Lady from the Sea as a âmermaidâ stranded on land, feeling trapped in her marriage with Dr Wangel and suffocated by her restrictive gender roles as wife and step-mother. The play focuses on Ellida the dying mermaidâs process of individuation as she struggles to seek happiness, freedom and self-fulfilment in life. Through Ellidaâs entangled relationship with the Stranger and her husband, Ibsen has created a living âmermaidâ, who enables him to explore gender relations, individual freedom and choice, as well as the liberation of the self. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â However, when The Lady from the Sea was transposed from Norway to China and adapted for the traditional Chinese theatre, the Chinese Yue theatre in this case, Ellida had undergone drastic changes in order to suit the traditional Yue theatregoersâ expectations and taste, as well as to fit the socio-cultural norm of traditional Yue opera. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Instead of examining those technical alterations such as rearrangement of scenes (Ye, 2011, 20, the use of symbols (Wu, 2011, 80, the setting (Wu, 2011, 78, or theatrical performance and devices (Qing Yun, 2010, 32 adopted in the Chinese operatic adaptation of The Lady from the Sea, this article focuses on the cultural re-presentation of Ellida and the re-constitution of her character, the purpose of which is to make her plausible as a Chinese woman on the traditional Yue stage. A close study of the cultural transformation of Ellida and her re-orientation on the traditional Yue stage adaptation will enable the reader to better understand the Chinese cultural emphasis on didacticism, Confucian morality and propriety in traditional drama and theatre, as well as the difficulties involved in transporting Ibsenâs mermaid to the Chinese traditional Yue stage.\n\nEffect of environmental conditions on flower induction of marian plum (Bouea burmanica Griff\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVusie L. Mavuso\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Marian plum flowering naturally occurs during the cool, dry season so Thailand farmers usually withdraw irrigation a month before flowering. However, irregular flowering continues to be a serious problem. This study investigated the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, soil moisture and relative humidity on flower induction of marian plum. Daily weather data were collected using weather stations in three orchards where flowering was also recorded. Thirty representative trees per orchard were randomly selected for data collection. The results showed that trees from all orchards flowered in response to low temperature (below 18â¯Â°C despite different levels of water stress and relative humidity. These results indicated that soil moisture content and relative humidity had no influence on marian plum flower induction but enhanced flower bud development. Night temperatures of 18â¯Â°C or lower are essential for marian plum flower induction.\n\nWomen in History--Marian Wright Edelman: Crusader for Civil and Children's Rights\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMills, Shirley J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis article profiles Marian Wright Edelman, a crusader for civil and children's rights.

It is found that there exists a middle layer between the porcelain glaze and body. And a line scanning analysis comparison was made with the Ru porcelain in Northern Song Dynasty. There are some differences between them and the middle layer of Dilingtou Yue sherd is a little thinner than the Ru sherd's. And elements' content distributions in glaze are different from Ru porcelain's and the changes of contents from the surface to the inner side of glaze are undulatory. The results indicate that the differences may result from the different materials of body and the different kilns.

The most popular open source implementation of MapReduce, Hadoop, is based on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). However, as HDFS is not POSIX compliant, it cannot be fully leveraged by applications running on a majority of existing HPC environments such as Teragrid and NERSC. These HPC environments typicallysupport globally shared file systems such as NFS and GPFS. On such resourceful HPC infrastructures, the use of Hadoop not only creates compatibility issues, but also affects overall performance due to the added overhead of the HDFS. This paper not only presents a MapReduce implementation directly suitable for HPC environments, but also exposes the design choices for better performance gains in those settings. By leveraging inherent distributed file systems' functions, and abstracting them away from its MapReduce framework, MARIANE (MApReduce Implementation Adapted for HPC Environments) not only allows for the use of the model in an expanding number of HPCenvironments, but also allows for better performance in such settings. This paper shows the applicability and high performance of the MapReduce paradigm through MARIANE, an implementation designed for clustered and shared-disk file systems and as such not dedicated to a specific MapReduce solution. The paper identifies the components and trade-offs necessary for this model, and quantifies the performance gains exhibited by our approach in distributed environments over Apache Hadoop in a data intensive setting, on the Magellan testbed at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).\n\nMaakondliku Liivide etluskonkursi vÃµitis gÃ¼mnasist Marian Heinat / Ene Kallas\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKallas, Ene\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMaakondliku Juhan ja Jakob Liivi etluskonkursi Å¾Ã¼riisse kuulusid Ott Aardam, KÃ¤the Pihlak, Piret Rauk, Vaido Luks ja Marili PÃ¤rtel.

La trayectoria cinematogrÃ¡fica del personaje de Lady Marian\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPÃ©rez Herrera, Gema\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The transformation of the role of women over the course of the 20th century can be seen particularly clearly in the cinema. The analysis of various cinematic representations of Lady Marian, Robin Hoodâs romantic partner, reveals the transformation in the female from feminine to heroic between 1922 and the present. This change involves Marian adopting male roles and being included in scenes that were previously reserved for male characters, together with a progressive masculinisation of women. Analysing films made in different decades shows how cinema always conveys a contemporary message, reflecting human and cultural models in keeping with the sensitivities of its viewers.La revoluciÃ³n histÃ³rica de la mujer a lo largo del siglo XX ha tenido su correlato en un testigo de excepciÃ³n: el cine. El anÃ¡lisis de varias representaciones cinematogrÃ¡ficas de Lady Marian, protagonista femenina de la leyenda de Robin Hood, desde 1922 hasta algunas de las producciones mÃ¡s recientes permite seÃ±alar que se ha producido un cambio en el papel de lo femenino en lo heroico. Este cambio pasa por la adopciÃ³n de roles y la inclusiÃ³n en escenarios antaÃ±o reservados para el protagonismo masculino, asÃ­ como por una progresiva masculinizaciÃ³n de la mujer. El anÃ¡lisis de las representaciones realizadas en cada dÃ©cada del siglo XX permite tambiÃ©n comprobar cÃ³mo el cine siempre proyecta un mensaje contemporÃ¡neo, reflejando en sus historias modelos humanos y culturales acordes con la sensibilidad de cada tiempo.\n\nComment on \"Localized water reverberation phases and its impact on back-projection images\" by Yue et al. [2017\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFan, W.; Shearer, P. M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFan and Shearer [2016] analyzed the 2012 Mw 7.2 Sumatra earthquake and reported that the earthquake dynamically triggered early aftershock/aftershocks 150 km away from the mainshock and 50 s later. The early aftershock/aftershocks were detected with teleseismic P-wave back-projection, coincided with passing surface waves, and showed observable seismic waveforms in a wide frequency range (0.02â5 Hz). Recently, however, Yue et al. [2017] interpreted these coda arrivals as water reverberations from the mainshock, based mostly on EGF analysis of a nearby M6 earthquake and a water-phase synthetic test. Here, we show detailed back-projection and waveform analysis of three M6 earthquakes within 100km of the Mw 7.2 earthquake, including the EGF event analyzed in Yue et al. [2017]. In addition, we examine the waveforms of three M5.5 reverse faulting earthquakes close to our detected early aftershock landward of the trench. Our results show that the coda energy in question is more likely caused by a separate earthquake near the trench than by a mainshock water reverberation phase, thus supporting our earlier conclusion that the detected coherent radiators are likely to be dynamically triggered early aftershock/aftershocks.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy de hervormer en het personalistisch presidentschap\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPas, N.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nNiek Pas explains that Nicolas Sarkozy's leadership qualities are difficult to assess.

A large amount of ancient porcelain sherds with accuracy provenance and ages were excavated from a lot of kiln sites in China. Archaeologists and ceramic experts have recognized and researched it with excavated stratum, utensil shape, body quality, glaze color and painting pattern. However, the appearance characteristic of some ancient porcelain manufactured in different kilns is similar. Therefore, it is still difficult to identify the provenance and ages of the samples excavated from some sites using traditional methods. Up, to now, many problems of Chinese ancient porcelain are confused for archaeologist and collecting experts. The elemental composition of ancient porcelain shows certain information of provenance and age. Especially, the sorts and contents of the elements in porcelain didn't change, so it is very useful to determine the provenance of ancient porcelain with elemental composition characteristics. Provenance characteristic is the important scientific information to identify ancient porcelain wares excavated from sites and graves. The porcelain samples of Si-Long-Kou Yue kiln in Zhejiang Province of china have been analyzed with NAA in this paper. The provenance characteristic was compared with it of Hong-Zhou kiln of Jiang-Xi Province and Yao-Zhou kiln of Shan-Xi Province. The experimental data were studied with statistic methods. The results show that the chemical compositions of porcelain body samples for three kilns were different. The difference was been able identified. The porcelain body materials of both Si-Long-Kou Yue kiln and Hong-Zhou kiln of Jiang-Xi were similar. The samples of Yao-Zhou kiln in north of China existed obvious difference.\n\nLand van skedels.

Our data suggest that at least a few lizards are probably more than 20 years old, and one lizard would be 31.5 years old if it grew at an average rate for the population. Ages of 20 and 30 years seem reasonable given the remarkably slow growth during capture intervals of more than a decade for five of the lizards which we estimated to be 20 or more years old. Like other lizards, island night lizard growth rates vary by size, with larger lizards growing more slowly. In general, growth rates were somewhat greater on San Nicolas Island (compared with Santa Barbara Island), and this increase was sustained through all of the intermediate size classes. The higher growth rate may account for the somewhat larger lizards present on San Nicolas Island, although we cannot discount the possibility that night lizards on San Nicolas are merely living longer. The high percentage of small lizards in the Eucalyptus habitat might seem to reflect a healthy population in that habitat, but the high proportion of small lizards appears to be caused by good reproduction in the 1900s and substantially poorer reproduction in subsequent years. The Eucalyptus habitat has dried quite a bit in recent years. Night lizards in the Haplopappus/Grassland habitat have shown an increase in the proportion of larger lizards since 2000. There has also been an increase in the proportion of large lizards in the Rock Cobble habitat at Redeye Beach. However, there are has been some change in habitat with more elephant seals occupying the same area just above the high tide as do the night lizards. Southern alligator lizards and side-blotched lizards are both non-native on San Nicolas Island. Neither lizard causes obvious harm to island night lizards, and management time and effort should\n\nNegotiating Culture, Economics and Community Politics: The Practice of Lei Yue Mun Tourism in Postcolonial Hong Kong\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nShun-Hing Chan\n\n2011-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This article is based on an on-going research project that examines how tourism is constructed in Hong Kong by using the specific tourist spot, Lei Yue Mun, as a case study. The articleâs aim is to demonstrate how the local agents of a small, squatter-based community with a distinctive history and cultural traditions may, without making any claim to indigenousness or aboriginality, manage a local economy and engage in cultural negotiation at the metropolitan, national and global levels. Their economic practices lead the authors to enquire whether preservationism or invoking historical traditions from the margins is the most significant form or strategy of cultural tourism.\n\nAnnual Quality Assurance Conference Files by Nicola Watson and Rui Li\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n26th Annual Quality Assurance Conference.

Marianism and mobility restriction\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVirginia Maria Fuentes GutiÃ©rrez\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper we outline some of the research results of a larger work which studies the Bolivian migration from a gender perspective, as well as the impact of the institutional practices that determine the transnational experience. In a global scene of restrictive rules concerning the human mobility, we notice how control and dominance strategies are present in ideologies and symbolic mechanisms. Women options in the migration process are trapped through them. We propose to recognize the symbolic and institutional violence that pressures migrants during their migration journey, focusing on understanding the ideological content â sexism and marianism â in which they are based on. We present an analysis of the instrumented ways of applying violence against Bolivian migrant women and its families from the social action practices implemented at origin and destination (transnational perspective.\n\nIntellectual pursuits of Nicolas Rashevsky the queer duck of biology\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nShmailov, Maya M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWho was Nicolas Rashevsky?

The important flavonoids found in the seeds of this plant are silybin, silychristin and silydianin is known as silymarin compounds, that is yellow. Increasing the desired compounds of medicinal plants is possible by cultivation techniques manipulation such as irrigation, fertilization or photo-bioreactor systems. Water deficient is the most important factors limiting the growth and yield of medicinal crops, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Bio-fertilizers as an alternative in some cases and in most cases as a complement to chemical fertilizers can help to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Han et al. (2006 in the study of the effect of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB, Bacillus megaterium var. phosphaticum and potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB, Bacillus mucilaginosus in nutrient limited soil planted with pepper and cucumber stated that Rock P and K applied either singly or in combination did not significantly enhance soil availability of P and K. PSB was a more potent P-solubilizer than KSB, and co-inoculation of PSB and KSB resulted in consistently higher P and K availability than in the control. Rock P with inoculation of PSB increased the availability of P and K, the uptake of N, P and K by shoots and roots, and the growth of both pepper and cucumber. Similar but less pronounced results were obtained when rock K and KSB were added concomitantly. Combined together, rock materials and both bacterial strains consistently increased further mineral availability, uptake and plant growth, suggesting their potential use as fertilizer. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of bio\n\nNicola Cabibbo (1935-2010)\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2010-01-01\n\nÂ Nicola Cabibbo, one of the most important theoretical physicists of our time, died of cancer in Rome on 16 August, 2010 at the age of 75.

Before the discovery of quarks, he gave the correct formulation of the weak current couplings that in modern terms corresponds to the phenomenon of quark mixing. His formulation, in terms of the famous Cabibbo angle, was later extended to three families of fermions (and more recently also applied to neutrino mixing), and plays an essential role in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions. Over the years he applied his extremely lucid, deep and flexible mind to a wide range of problems, also including experiments, such as the measurement in 1963 of the electron helicity in muon decay, and the conception and design of the parallel computers APE, which he developed, starting in the early 1980s, for the simulation of the QCD theory of the strong interactions on discrete space-time.

In the XVII century these paintings were very popular in the Netherlands, and in this country the cities flourished as cultural centers searching the anatomy knowledge. Nicolaes Tulp was one of the persons in the center of Amsterdam's scene during XVII century. In 1632 Tulp was 39 years old, and he was an anatomist and a surgeon. Rembrandt masterly shows an autopsy performed by Dr. Tulp. This picture is the description of the beginning of a medical intellectual utopia: the absolute visibility of the disease. Unfortunately this utopia is blind to the complete visibility of the psycho-socio-cultural dimensions of the ill.\n\nThen and Now: Memories of a Patriarchal Ireland in the Work of Marian Keyes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRyan, Mary\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper will observe how the work of Irish author Marian Keyes is influenced by,and representative of, the place of women in Ireland in terms of historical issues, social values,and legal issues. It will discuss two primary areas that have affected women in Irish society: the family and the female body. In addressing how such issues were traditionally viewed in Irish society, this paper will demonstrate how Keyesâ novels present an awareness âa memoryâ of how Irish womenâs lives were once repressed by patriarchal values, and how contemporary women still, to some extent, feel the effects âthe restraintsâ of such attitudes.\n\nJounin Nicolas, Chantier interdit au public\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWilliams Nuytens\n\n2011-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Le travail de Nicolas Jounin sâappuie sur des enquÃªtes de terrain rÃ©alisÃ©es dans la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© des annÃ©es 2000, en France, dans le monde du bÃ¢timent, sur des chantiers et autour de ceux-ci.

It argues that the conventional form assumed by his drawings or 'inscriptions' â the indications of scale, the delineation of options, the signatures and marginal notes â can be read as traces of seduction that helped 'translate' potential patrons to a taste for Rococo. The essay further suggests that the activation of the taste at the point of commission was kept alive in the designs executed by the bi-modal asymmetry that is characteristic of the goÃ»t pittoresque because its exercise was considered a mark of refinement.\n\nStability and change in kelp forest habitats at San Nicolas Island\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKenner, Michael C.; Tinker, M. Tim\n\n2018-01-01\n\nKelp forest communities are highly variable over space and time. Despite this complexity it has been suggested that kelp forest communities can be classified into one of 2 states: kelp dominated or sea urchin dominated. It has been further hypothesized that these represent âalternate stable statesâ because a site can remain in either of these states for decades before some perturbation causes a rapid shift to the other state. Our research group has maintained a subtidal community monitoring program for 38 years at San Nicolas Island consisting of twice-annual scuba-based surveys at 6 sites distributed within 4 regions around the island. Three types of perturbations are thought to be relevant to subtidal community dynamics at San Nicolas: (1) physical disturbances in the form of major storm and El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events; (2) invertebrate diseases, which periodically decimate urchin populations; and (3) the reintroduction and subsequent increase of sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis). These 3 perturbations differ in spatial and temporal specificity; physical disturbances and disease outbreaks occur periodically and could affect all 4 regions, while sea otter predation has been concentrated primarily at the West End sites over the last 15 years. The different types of perturbations and the duration of the time series at the kelp forests at San Nicolas make the data set ideal for testing the âalternate stable stateâ hypothesis. We use nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to examine spatial and temporal patterns of community similarity at the 4 regions. In particular, we evaluate support for the existence of stable states, which are represented on NMDS plots as distinct spatial clusters. Community dynamics at each site approximated a biased random walk in NMDS space, with one or more basins of attraction and occasional jumps between basins. We found evidence for alternative stable states at some sites, and we show that transitions from one\n\nThe anatomy lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt : A comparison of the painting with a dissected left forearm of a Dutch male cadaver\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nIjpma, Frank F.

Drawing on literature produced for their members, this article demonstrates how gendered understandings were fundamental to the congregations' symbolic delineation of an uncontaminated Catholic space. Visions of an incorrupt male elite abound, reinforcing the Jesuits' educational mission among future leaders and opinion-formers. In contrast, the purity of women and children was seen as a sign of society's moral health. Modesty was the quintessential female virtue. Yet, the cult of the Virgin Mary suggested that the virginal female body was both tool and symbol in the struggle against a fallen world. Girls were, therefore, charged with the task of moral guardianship. Such campaigns were emblematic of Spanish Catholicism's tendency to proffer religious solutions to social problems.\n\nNicolae Ceausescu and Santiago Carrillo.

A reading of Marian Engelâs Bear = Desmetaforizando e tornando-se animal: quando o animal retorna o olhar. Uma leitura do romance Bear, de Marian Engel\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandra Meoni\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The primacy acquired by nature in our current culture has given way to several issues not strictly connected with an immediate and âpurelyâ ecological interest: there is rather the need to question how we conceive the animal with a focus on the possibility to transcend Western cultural heritage. When trying to give a literary representation of the animal, it is particularly important to adopt some measures which, following the trajectory of a genuine, positive âbecoming-animalâ, will safeguard its independence and avoid reducing it to metaphorically anthropomorphic representations. This essay intends to underline how, from this viewpoint, a few novels coming from the post-colonial area, where animal tales often show how interwoven humans and animals are and how they are constructed in relation to each other supply interesting case studies. My interest focuses particularly on Canadian Marian Engelâs Bear, where the writer tries to deal with unspeakable subjects between a woman and a bear: through an act of radical approach to its physical reality, the former comes first to recognize the latter, and then to accept its Otherness. On its side, the bear seemingly âshowsâ a post-colonial attitude subversively resisting a typically Western anthropomorphic allegorization. Holding fast to itself and its animality, choosing in a way to âstay muteâ, the bear keeps the role of a âperceptivecatalystâ, âthought-producingâ and thus âworld-changingâ, according to an aesthetics of perception suggesting that the animal gaze might be the best perspective from which to observe not only our world, but especially our own selves.Uma leitura do romance Bear, de Marian Engel.

The first and regionally most important event is sharply defined by new K-Ar dates between 200 and 209 Ma for the Thuya, Wildhorse, Iron Mask, and Allison batholiths and a 205 +- 10 Ma Rb-Sr isochron for the Guichon Creek batholith. All these plutons were emplaced approximately at the change from Triassic to Jurassic time. The related and slightly older Nicola volcanic rocks are altered by addition of more radiogenic sedimentary Sr (Carnian Nicola limestone having 87 Sr/ 86 Sr=0.7075+- 1) and do not give an isochron date. The Coldwater stock is anomalously old (K-Ar dates range from 215-267 Ma). The Mid- to late Jurassic igneous event is indicated by a 141 Ma K-Ar date for the Mount Martley batholith. Mid-Cretaceous volcanic rocks of the Kingsvale Group give a Rb-Sr isochron date of 112 +- 10 Ma and are postdated by the crosscutting and slightly younger Summers Creek stock (100 Ma by K-Ar). The final event straddles the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary with the Nicola batholith emplaced about 60 Ma ago (K-Ar) and the Rey Lake stock perhaps slightly earlier (69 Ma by K-Ar). Initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios range from 0.7025-0.7046 with a mean and mode near 0.7037 which is within the range of modern circum-Pacific volcanoes. Initial ratios of 0.7034 +- 1 for the Guichon Creek batholith, 0.7035 +- 1 for the Iron Mask batholith 70435 +-10 for the Thuya batholith, and 0.70379 +- 4 for the Kingsvale volcanic rocks are the most precisely determined. The Coldwater stock is anomalously low at 0.7025. For the other plutonic bodies only scattered or single analyses are available. The Nicola volcanic rocks appear to have once been similar in initial ratio the the Guichon Creek batholith but their calculated initial ratios now scatter from 0.7034-0.7073.

Tim; Bodkin, James L.; Cowen, Robert K.; Harrold, Christopher; Novak, Mark; Rassweiler, Andrew; Reed, Daniel C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSan Nicolas Island is surrounded by broad areas of shallow subtidal habitat, characterized by dynamic kelp forest communities that undergo dramatic and abrupt shifts in community composition. Although these reefs are fished, the physical isolation of the island means that they receive less impact from human activities than most reefs in Southern California, making San Nicolas an ideal place to evaluate alternative theories about the dynamics of these communities. Here we present monitoring data from seven sampling stations surrounding the island, including data on fish, invertebrate, and algal abundance. These data are unusual among subtidal monitoring data sets in that they combine relatively frequent sampling (twice per year) with an exceptionally long time series (since 1980). Other outstanding qualities of the data set are the high taxonomic resolution captured and the monitoring of permanent quadrats and swaths where the history of the community structure at specific locations has been recorded through time. Finally, the data span a period that includes two of the strongest ENSO events on record, a major shift in the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the reintroduction of sea otters to the island in 1987 after at least 150 years of absence. These events provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of bottom-up forcing, top-down control, and physical disturbance on shallow rocky reef communities.\n\nThe anatomy lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt (1632): a comparison of the painting with a dissected left forearm of a Dutch male cadaver.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIJpma, Frank F A; van de Graaf, Robert C; Nicolai, Jean-Philippe A; Meek, Marcel F\n\n2006-01-01\n\nRembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632) is considered a masterpiece and is a group portrait of the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons in the form of an anatomy lesson.

K.; Shim, J.; Yoon, H. I.; Kang, Y. C.; Jang, Y. H.\n\n2007-06-01\n\nParticulate suspended material was recovered over a 23-month period using two sediment traps deployed in shallow water (Ë30 m deep) off the King Sejong Station located in Marian Cove of King George Island, West Antarctica. Variability in seasonal flux and geochemical characteristics of the sediment particles highlights seasonal patterns of sedimentation of both lithogenic (terrigenous) and biogenic particles in the coastal glaciomarine environment. All components including total mass flux, lithogenic particle flux and biogenic particle flux show distinct seasonal variation, with high recovery rates during the summer and low rates under winter fast ice. The major contributor to total mass flux is the lithogenic component, comprising from 88% during the summer months (about 21 g m -2 d -1) up to 97% during the winter season (about 2 g m -2 d -1). The lithogenic particle flux depends mainly on the amount of snow-melt (snow accumulation) delivered into the coastal region as well as on the resuspension of sedimentary materials. These fine-grained lithogenic particles are silt-to-clay sized, composed mostly of clay minerals weathered on King George Island. Biogenic particle flux is also seasonal. Winter flux is Ë0.2 g m -2 d -1, whereas the summer contribution increases more than tenfold, up to 2.6 g m -2 d -1. Different biogenic flux between the two summers indicates inter-annual variability to the spring-summer phytoplankton bloom. The maximum of lithogenic particle flux occurs over a short period of time, and follows the peak of biogenic particle flux, which lasts longer. The seasonal warming and sea-ice retreat result in change in seawater nutrient status and subsequent ice-edge phytoplankton production. Meanwhile, the meltwater input to Marian Cove from the coastal drainage in January to February plays a major role in transporting lithogenic particles into the shallow water environment, although the tidal currents may be the main agents of resuspension in this\n\nAspects of financial history in Romania. Reform and reformers. The financial tax reform accomplished BY Nicolae Titulescu\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCiobanu, R.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a brief history of the financial reform designed by Nicolae Titulescu at the beginning of the 1920âs. His tax reform law was formulated after thorough research of other European tax systems. He tried to implement it while he was Minister of Finance. Even though the law was adopted, it was never enacted. It met a certain amount of controversy in the Assembly of Deputies. The analysis made also tries to explain the cedular tax system.\n\nMedical and neuropsychiatric phenomena depicted in two Spanish medieval texts of Marian miracles.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Assis Aquino Gondim, Francisco; Bastante, Pamela; Gondim, Wilcar Cavalcante; Filha, Joana Gurgel Holanda; Thomas, Florian P\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn the history of Christianity, veneration of the Virgin Mary reached its greatest intensity in the XIII century. Her perceived impact on daily life was tremendous and not surprisingly this extended to the spheres of disease and healing. The purpose of this study is to compare the medical and neuropsychiatric findings in two XIII century Spanish texts of Marian miracles, both examples of the popular Catholicism (vs. official catholic doctrine). We analyzed the medical and neuropsychiatric events in the Cantigas de Santa Maria (Canticles of St. Mary, CSM), composed at the court of Alfonso X and the Milagros de Nuestra SeÃ±ora (The Miracles of Our Lady, MNS), written by Gonzalo de Berceo. Among the 25 miracles reported in the MNS, medically relevant facts were addressed in 19 miracles with a total of 23 recorded events (including resurrection or escape from death in five) and demonic possession in three (one with witchcraft/deicide). The most common medical subjects were ergotism, obstetric-gynecological, sudden death, intellectual disability/illiteracy, encephalopathy/alcohol intoxication, suicide (with self-mutilation/castration), infanticide, infections, and absence of body decomposition after death. The 427 canticles in the CSM contain 270 medically relevant facts. Neuropsychiatric conditions were alluded to in 98 songs. Blindness and dystonia/weakness/deformities were the most common phenomena. Illuminations detailed many of the medical facts in the CSM, but not in the MNS. Medically relevant facts were described in both texts, but with more details in the CSM. Neurological conditions were more often described in the CSM, psychiatric conditions in the MNS.\n\nTHE BAGATELLE GENRE AND ITS REALIZATION IN THE CREATION OF COMPOSER NICOLAE CIOLAC\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nANDRONOVICI-RUSU ADELA\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available In the present paper there is an excursion into the history of the bagatelle genre. Initially conceived as a piece of minor importance, with a moderate instrumental-technical aspect that belongs to âeasyâ pieces for interpretation, the bagatelle durÂ­ing its evolution, obtained a status of an aphoristic musical genre in which a profound ideative content is essentially conveyed in a laconic, concentrated form. Further are analyzed five Bagatelles for piano written by composer Nicolae Ciolac. The author considers the thematic and architectural problems of the opus, as well as some speciic interpretative peculiarities. In concluÂ­sion it is affirmed that the analyzed bagatelles represent s group of pieces novel for Moldovan composition that has at its base a logic characteristic of the miniature genre.\n\nDescripciÃ³n actual de la enfermedad de Durand, Nicolas y Favre\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLaurentino MuÃ±oz\n\n1950-04-01\n\nFull Text Available En los Ãºltimos aÃ±os la ciencia mÃ©dica logra esclarecer el cuadro de la Enfermedad de Durand, Nicolas y Favre; confundida con las otras enfermedades venÃ©reas y aun con la Tuberculosis en Ã©pocas que se van alejando, somos dueÃ±os ahora no solo de la enseÃ±anza clÃ­nica, de medios de diagnostico y terapÃ©uticos, para apreciar y combatir la primitiva lesiÃ³n y sus complicaciones, sino que el cuadro de la enfermedad se ensancha y adquiere importancia inusitada, de simple adenitis inguinal con bubÃ³n o fistulizada que a pesar de la cronicidad se consideraba como lesiÃ³n local, llegamos a la realidad de localizaciones del virus paradenico a 10 largo del tubo digestivo, en los vasos sanguÃ­neos y linfÃ¡ticos (a distancia, en el ojo y oÃ­do, en el sistema nervioso, en la piel, en las articulaciones.\n\nNicolas Michel, Une Ã©conomie de subsistances.

The flight commenced at about 14:30 UTC (7:30 Pacific Daylight Time) and lasted six and one-half hours. The position of the Colorado State University (CSU) instrument package as a function of time is shown. For the purpose of presentation of results, researchers divided the flight into 13 legs. These legs consist of 20 minute constant level runs, with the exception of leg 1, which is a sounding from the surface to just above 930 mb. The laser ceilometer record of cloud base is also shown. The cloud base averaged around 970 mb during much of the flight but was more variable near the end. Before the tethered balloon flight commenced, a Communications Link Analysis and Simulation System (CLASS) sounding was released at 12:11 UTC (5:11 PDT). Temperature and moisture data below 927 mb for this sounding is shown. The sounding indicates a cloud top around 955 mb at this time.\n\nEspaÃ§os com histÃ³ria na Lisboa dos sÃ©culos XVIII e XIX.

Appointed General Vicar by the exiled Bishop Inochentie Micu-Klein in 1747, Balomiri fled Transylvania shortly afterwards when the Court in Vienna refused to acknowledge his appointment, instead supporting his predecessor, Petru Pavel Aaron. Early on in his exile, Balomiri converted to Orthodoxy, and was later made Archimandrite of the Monastery of Curtea de ArgeÅ. From exile in Wallachia, he continued to campaign for the rights of Romanian Orthodox Christians in Transylvania, lobbying Russian Empress Elisabeta Petrovna to intervene with the Viennese to request a non-United bishop for Transylvania. Many historians have glossed over Balomiriâs importance, possibly because of his controversial role as an apostate priest.\n\nSea-level history during the Last Interglacial complex on San Nicolas Island, California: implications for glacial isostatic adjustment processes, paleozoogeography and tectonics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMuhs, Daniel R.; Simmons, Kathleen R.; Schumann, R. Randall; Groves, Lindsey T.; Mitrovica, Jerry X.; Laurel, Deanna\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSan Nicolas Island, California has one of the best records of fossiliferous Quaternary marine terraces in North America, with at least fourteen terraces rising to an elevation of ~270 m above present-day sea level. In our studies of the lowest terraces, we identified platforms at 38-36 m (terrace 2a), 33-28 m (terrace 2b), and 13-8 m (terrace 1). Uranium-series dating of solitary corals from these terraces yields three clusters of ages: ~120 ka on terrace 2a (marine isotope stage [MIS] 5.5), ~120 and ~100 ka on terrace 2b (MIS 5.5 and 5.3), and ~80 ka (MIS 5.1) on terrace 1. We conclude that corals on terrace 2b that date to ~120 ka were reworked from a formerly broader terrace 2a during the ~100 ka sea stand. Fossil faunas differ on the three terraces. Isolated fragments of terrace 2a have a fauna similar to that of modern waters surrounding San Nicolas Island. A mix of extralimital southern and extralimital northern species is found on terrace 2b, and extralimital northern species are on terrace 1. On terrace 2b, with its mixed faunas, extralimital southern species, indicating warmer than present waters, are interpreted to be from the ~120 ka high sea stand, reworked from terrace 2a. The extralimital northern species on terrace 2b, indicating cooler than present waters, are interpreted to be from the ~100 ka sea stand. The abundant extralimital northern species on terrace 1 indicate cooler than present waters at ~80 ka. Using the highest elevations of the ~120 ka platform of terrace 2a, and assuming a paleo-sea level of +6 m based on previous studies, San Nicolas Island has experienced late Quaternary uplift rates of ~0.25-0.27 m/ka. These uplift rates, along with shoreline angle elevations and ages of terrace 2b (~100 ka) and terrace 1 (~80 ka) yield relative (local) paleo-sea level elevations of +2 to +6 m for the ~100 ka sea stand and -11 to -12 m for the ~80 ka sea stand. These estimates are significantly higher than those reported for the ~100 ka and ~80 ka\n\nNew insight into the enigmatic white cord in Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJackowe, David J; Moore, Michael K; Bruner, Andrew E; Fredieu, John R\n\n2007-11-01\n\nThe anatomic accuracy of Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632) has been debated in the literature for many years. The white cord that courses along the ulnar aspect of the carpus and small finger of the cadaver in Dr. Tulp's dissection conforms to no normal anatomic structure and is believed to represent an anomalous branch of the ulnar nerve, an artistic error, or a combination of both. After the discovery of an accessory abductor digiti minimi (AADM) during a routine dissection of a late-middle-aged male cadaver, we noted that the course of its tendon over the hypothenar eminence resembled the white cord in the painting. After conducting a detailed literature search and anatomic interpretation of the painting, we established 4 criteria for identifying the white cord. Using these criteria, we evaluated the plausibility of an AADM being represented in the painting. We conclude that an AADM should be considered as a possible explanation for the white cord.\n\nOs retratos de Maria Isabel e Maria Francisca de BraganÃ§a, de Nicolas-Antoine Taunay\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElaine Dias\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, French landscape painter, produced also several portraits during his stay at the Rio de Janeiro Court. In this city, in 1816, he paints the queen Carlota Joaquina and all her daughters. In this group, two portraits have a very special way: the paintings still today catalogued as Maria Francisca and Maria Teresa, but probably being Maria Isabel and Maria Francisca de Assis - princesses that, in this year, left Brazil to marry the Spanish King Fernando VII, and his brother Carlos Maria Isidro de Bourbon. In this article, beyond to describe these portraits (and analyse the identities of the portrayed princesses, I analyse their functions in the Court society and the mains artists of this gender in Europe. I will discuss, as well, the hypothesis about the Taunay choices. In this sense, I will analyse the possible circulation of the typologies of portrait between Italy, Portugal, Spain and France, understanding these productions by Taunay and the functions occupied by these portraits in the political relations between Brazil and Europe.\n\n[Universal elixir of Thomas-Nicolas Larcheret (1819) and his elixirian and normal doctrine].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBonnemain, Bruno\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThomas-Nicolas Larcheret, teacher in singing, declamation, guitar or lyre and violin, author of music and books, but also inventor of the universal elixir by his name, is a good example of quack of the 19th century. His book Larcheregium ou Dictionnaires spÃ©ciaux de mon Ã©lixir, ainsi que toute ma doctrine et de mes adhÃ©rens (Larcheregium or special Dictionaries of my elixir, as well as all my doctrine and my adherents), published in 1819, deserves a deep study to show the most frequently used arguments by the ones who emphasize the value of their secret remedy. The opportunities are there to present themselves as victims of medical authorities, experts and authorities as a whole, that do not recognize the value of their product. The only acceptable judge for them is the experience reported by the patients who are able to demonstrate the efficacy of the product since they do buy it (probably at a very high price). From this viewpoint, the book of Larcheret is a good example of turning the authorities down and of diatribe against physicians and pharmacists. It is also the demonstration that, even with the Empire's new regulations against secret remedies and quacks, they will still persist for a large part of the 19th century in France.\n\nSola Pulcherrima Super Solem - âMore Beautiful than the Sun and Monthâ (Marian Prayer from Gertrudeâs and Nawojkaâs Prayer-Books\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKarolina Targosz\n\n2004-12-01\n\nFull Text Available A new critical edition of a collection of nearly one hundred Latin prayers connected with Gertrude of Poland (ca 1025-1108, Polish princess, wife of Izaslav of Kiev, has revived an interest in this exceptional example of literature and religiousness o f the eleventh century. The multiplicity of issues connected with the prayer book requires further consideration. An example might be the iconographic concord of prayers both with the accompanying miniatures and the works of art, which Gertrude encountered in the west as well as in the east -from Rhineland, where she was educated to Ruthenia, where she stayed longest. The paper examines the issue in relation to the Marian subject matter. A problem that has not as yet been touched upon is the history o f the prayers in the centuries that followed, as a singular example from the 15th century regarding one such prayer reveals. The prayers are mostly theocentric and Christocentric in character, but in many of them the intercessive role of St. Mary is evoked. In Ruthenia Gertrude was exposed to representations of the Deesis type, characteristic of eastern Christianity. From the princeâs box in St. Sophiaâs Cathedral in Kiev she saw them in a form of three tondi, situated on the arch encasing the central apse, while in the apse itself was a monumental depiction of St. Mary-Oranta, eternal and omnipotent advocate in heaven, referred to in prayers as âoratrix celorumâ. Of the four prayers directed exclusively to Mary two are laudatory and supplicatory and the other two just laudatory. The latter are characterized by a sophisticated literary form, division into phrases, employment of internal and external rhymes and a number of rhetorical figures (alliteration, oxymorons. A solar epithet appears here among others (âsola pulcherrima super solemâ. A lot of Marian epithets, such as the Mother of God, Our Lady and the Queen of the whole world (âDei genitrixâ, âdomina et regina totius orbisâ\n\nThe biological soil crusts of the San Nicolas Island: Enigmatic algae from a geographically isolated ecosystem\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFlechtner, V.R.; Johansen, J.R.; Belnap, J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nComposite soil samples from 7 sites on San Nicolas Island were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively for the presence of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae. Combined data demonstrated a rich algal flora with 19 cyanobacterial and 19 eukaryotic microalgal genera being identified, for a total of 56 species. Nine new species were identified and described among the cyanobacteria and the eukaryotic microalgae that were isolated: Leibleinia edaphica, Aphanothece maritima, Chroococcidiopsis edaphica, Cyanosarcina atroveneta, Hassallia californica, Hassallia pseudoramosissima, Microchaete terrestre, Palmellopsis californiens, and Pseudotetracystis compactis. Distinct distributional patterns of algal taxa existed among sites on the island and among soil algal floras of western North America. Some algal taxa appeared to be widely distributed across many desert regions, including Microcoleus vaginatus, Nostoc punctiforme, Nostoc paludosum, and Tolypothrix distorta, Chlorella vulgaris, Diplosphaera cf. chodatii, Myrmecia astigmatica, Myrmecia biatorellae, Hantzschia amphioxys, and Luticola mutica. Some taxa share a distinctly southern distribution with soil algae from southern Arizona, southern California, and Baja California (e.g., Scenedesmus deserticola and Eustigmatos magnus). The data presented herein support the view that the cyanobacterial and microalgal floras of soil crusts possess significant biodiversity, much of it previously undescribed.\n\nDiet patterns of island foxes on San Nicolas Island relative to feral cat removal\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCypher, Brian L.; Kelly, Erica C.; Ferrara, Francesca J.; Drost, Charles A.; Westall, Tory L.; Hudgens, Brian\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIsland foxes (Urocyon littoralis) are a species of conservation concern that occur on six of the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. We analysed island fox diet on San Nicolas Island during 2006â12 to assess the influence of the removal of feral cats (Felis catus) on the food use by foxes. Our objective was to determine whether fox diet patterns shifted in response to the cat removal conducted during 2009â10, thus indicating that cats were competing with foxes for food items. We also examined the influence of annual precipitation patterns and fox abundance on fox diet. On the basis of an analysis of 1975 fox scats, use of vertebrate prey â deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), birds, and lizards â increased significantly during and after the complete removal of cats (nâ=â66) from the island. Deer mouse abundance increased markedly during and after cat removal and use of mice by foxes was significantly related to mouse abundance. The increase in mice and shift in item use by the foxes was consistent with a reduction in exploitative competition associated with the cat removal. However, fox abundance declined markedly coincident with the removal of cats and deer mouse abundance was negatively related to fox numbers. Also, annual precipitation increased markedly during and after cat removal and deer mouse abundance closely tracked precipitation. Thus, our results indicate that other confounding factors, particularly precipitation, may have had a greater influence on fox diet patterns.\n\nThe Pilgrimage to The San Nicola Shrine in Bari and its Impact\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKatia Rizzello\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Pilgrimage is defined as a journey to the Holy but more specifically as an inner journey to oneâs deepest religious feelings. This type of journey has assumed new forms and types that bring it closer to modern tourism in general, though it maintains its distinctive characteristics, which will be the object of this paper. These changes in the nature of pilgrimage, which in part reflect the parallel socio-cultural transformation of the average visitor, have brought about a major reorganisation of the places involved and have had a significant socio-economic impact on the territories involved. The concentration of visitors and in some cases the presence of various categories of visit have led to structural changes in holy places and their surroundings. These changes, which arise from the need to meet the requirements of travellers as consumers, in turn have social and environmental impacts on the surrounding area that are similar to those caused by mass tourism. The most evident types of impact are structural, resulting from the creation or expansion of hotel and catering infrastructure and the start-up of new businesses such as travel agencies, specialised tour operators, shops selling religious souvenirs and establishments providing entertainment. All this alters the physiognomy and the layout of the towns where the religious sites are located, in some cases completely transforming the economy of the location and the use of land. The aim of this research is to study pilgrimage flows associated with the cult of Saint Nicholas (San Nicola in Bari, specifically concerning the pilgrimage's main characteristics and the most significant impacts on the district. The study follows a mixed approach that includes participant observation, use of archival documents and empirical evaluation of the material landscape and observed practices.\n\nNRL tethered balloon measurements at San Nicolas Island during FIRE IFO 1987\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGerber, Hermann; Gathman, Stuart; James, Jeffrey; Smith, Mike; Consterdine, Ian; Brandeki, Scott\n\n1990-01-01\n\nAn overview is given of the tethered balloon measurements made during the First ISCCP Regional Experiment (FIRE) marine stratocumulus intensive field observations (IFO) at San Nicolas Island in 1987. The instrument utilized on the balloon flights, the 17 flights over a 10 day period, the state of the data analysis, and some preliminary results are described. A goal of the measurements with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) balloon was to give a unique and greatly improved look at the microphysics of the clear and cloud-topped boundary layer. For this goal, collocated measurements were made of turbulence, aerosol, cloud particles, and meteorology. Two new instruments which were expected to make significant contributions to this effort were the saturation hygrometer, capable of measuring 95 percent less than RH 105 percent (with an accuracy of 0.05 percent near 100 percent) and used for the first time in clouds; and the forward scatter meter which gives in situ LWC measurements at more than 10 Hz. The data set, while unfortunately only partially simultaneous with the bulk of the FIRE stratocumulus observations, is unique and worthwhile in its own right. For the first time accurate RH measurements near 100 percent have been made in-cloud; although, the use of the saturation hygrometer reflected a learning experience which will result is substantially better performance the next time. These measurements were made in conjunction with other microphysical measurements such as aerosol and cloud droplet spectra, and perhaps most important of all, they were all collocated with bivane turbulence measurements thus permitting flux calculations. Thus the analysis of this data set, which consisted of about 50 percent stratocumulus cases including increasing and decreasing partial cloud cover, should lead to new insights on the physical mechanisms which drive the boundary-layer/cloud/turbulence system.\n\nNicolas Lyon-Caen , La boÃ®te Ã Perrette, le jansÃ©nisme parisien au xviiie siÃ¨cle\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVermander, BenoÃ®t\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNicolas Lyon-Â­Â­Â­Caen publie ici sa thÃ¨se souÂ­Â­teÂ­Â­nue en 2008 Ã lâuniÂ­Â­verÂ­Â­sitÃ© Paris I (dir.

The Feldenkrais Method in the Puppeteerâs Training from the Perspective of Nicolas Gousseffâs Handheld Puppets Workshops\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCiofu Anca-Mihaela\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Although the Feldenkrais method is quite well-known and used in relation to dance, music, and acting, it is rather uncommon to associate it with animation theatre. The puppeteerâs art is a profession that requires motor skills and sustained physical effort, which demands that the animating actor has an extended consciousness of oneself and of the space. Therefore, the Feldenkrais method can be a useful instrument in the puppeteerâs education and training, as the placing of the body in a relaxed stance, one which helps in the management of pain and effort, facilitates the conscious and creative learning of animation techniques, with an emphasis on the coordination and fluidity of movement. These are learning principles of the art of animation that are successfully used by Nicolas Gousseff, an artist that was formed at ESNAM (Ãcole SupÃ©rieure Nationale des Arts de la Marionnette de la Charleville-MÃ©ziÃ¨res, and who has specialized in handheld puppets and using the actorâs body as a performative space for this type of animation.\n\nLa teoria della letteratura di Nicolas Calas. Surrealismo, marxismo e psicanalisi in Foyers dâincendie\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. D'Urso\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available ENThis contribution â probably the first specifically concerning Nicolas Calas to be published in Italian â intends to examine some particular topics of Foyers dâincendie [Hearths of Arson] (1938, a work that hardly can be found, by now. So this study will try to partially fill the absence at an international level of a detailed analysis of this book which is usually considered to be âdifficultâ and therefore often hastily put under the label of âFreudo-Marxismâ. Not only does this label appear confusing when we look more care-fully at the historical context of the Thirties, but it also does not allow to understand in what both Marxism and Freudism are criticized indeed, this aspect defining more clearly the surrealist character â eluded or taken for granted by critics â of Foyers dâincendie. In the first half of this paper, we will underline the role of Surrealism in Calasâ critical evolution in relation to orthodox Communism, whose language he still used before becoming indubitably a Surrealist. Then we will show the enthusiastic reception of Foyers dâincendie among the Surrealists and also the reasons of their appreciation. In the second half, we will go deep inside some pages of this book which concern more spe-cifically the theory of literature and the critique of ideology we can draw from Foyers dâincendie. This is why â for the first time â we will summarize Calasâ understanding of the literary and philosophical history, and show the role that Dialectical Materialism (chiefly that of Engelsâ Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State and psychoanalysis (as it is considered by Surrealism play in his analysis.>>Questo contributo â apparentemente il primo studio specificamente dedicato a Nicolas Calas ad essere pubblicato in italiano â intende affrontare alcuni particolari contenuti dellâormai quasi introvabile Foyers dâincendie (1938, tentando cosÃ¬ di colmare, almeno parzialmente, lâ\n\nFission-track evidence of tectonic evolution in the northwestern ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nGuo-Qiang Sun\n\n2018-02-14\n\nFeb 14, 2018 ... from further collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates along the Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone.
