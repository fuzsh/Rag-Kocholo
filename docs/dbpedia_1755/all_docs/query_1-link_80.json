Although the frailties of human rights as an ideal or ideology or as state practice are evident, that ideal has become a part of modern consciousness, a lens through which to see the world, a universal discourse, a potent aspiration. The coursebook uses the term ‘human rights movement to include post-1945 governmental, intergovernmental and nongovernmental developments in both national and international contexts in the recognition and protection of human rights. However striking and disheartening its major failures and inadequacies, the movement has shown not only staying power and growth, but also a remarkably broad dissemination of its message. Its claims of permanence carry ever greater credibility. Today’s university curriculum dwarfs what was available for study in this field as few as 25 years ago. It evidences the significance of international human rights for fields of study as diverse as law, government, international relations, moral theory, public health, world financial institutions, the environment, economic development, ethnic conflict, religion, education, cultural studies and social\n\nanthropology. Although the human rights movement now forms an indelible part of our legal, political and moral landscape, and indeed perhaps precisely because of that status, recent decades have witnessed deeper and more numerous challenges to the foundations upon which the movement has been built, its aspirations to universality, and its claims of growing success in spreading and realizing its message. In response to these many challenges, the book seeks to examine the movement’s failures as well as triumphs and dilemmas in seeking to achieve human rights ideals across the world’s many histories and cultures. The book builds on the premise that a basic course in human rights should educate students to see the ‘big picture’. Of course it should enable students to master the history, doctrine, and institutional structures of the movement. But it should\n\nalso persuade students to think critically about the subject as a whole. Thus the text and materials describe, analyse, criticize, and propose, all from a range of political, cultural, moral and geopolitical perspectives. They do not impose any single dogma, direction or method for thinking about the history of or appropriate path for human rights. These vexing issues are for the student to work out. The book prepares students to work with commitment and critical reflection in a range of roles related to human rights: concerned citizen, advocate, teacher, scholar, activist in a governmental or\n\nnongovernmental organization, policy analyst.\n\nvi\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nPrincipal features of the book The conceptual framework for the book consists, in sequence, of the historical\n\ndevelopment and character of human rights discourse and basic norms; the dilem-\n\nmas of rights and duties, and of universalism and cultural relativism; the architec-\n\nture of international institutions as well as their functions, powers and interplay with norms; and the interaction of states with international law and organizations\n\nas well as with each other. Certain major themes run through the different parts of the book — for example, changing notions of autonomy and sovereignty, the changing configuration of the public-private divide in human rights ordering, the interplay of duties and rights in the gradual expansion of the human rights movement, the escalating tensions between international human rights and national security, the striking evolution of ideas about the nature and purposes of the movement itself. Some of our premises about the study of international human rights inform the book as a whole: 1. Human rights are violated within individual states, not in outer space or on the high seas. One might therefore argue that the study of rights should concentrate on different states — say, human rights in Nigeria, Peru, China, the United States, Iran, France. Such a book could offer contextual studies of human rights issues — police brutality, press freedom, discrimination, education, freedoms of and from\n\nreligion, political participation, health care and so on — that would draw on different national histories and political cultures. It would have the character and high value of studies in comparative law, history and culture. This book follows a different path. The distinctive aspect of the human rights movement of the last six decades has been its invention and development on the international level. Hence the stress is on the international human rights system, as well as on the vital relationships between that system and states’ internal orders. Although many illustrations throughout the book draw on human rights violations within one or another state, most of the materials address international norms,\n\nprocesses and institutions (governmental and nongovernmental), both in their own terms and in terms of their interaction with states. 2. What are the sensible boundaries of a book that has an important focus on ‘law’? Clearly the coursebook could not achieve its goals if it held to a formal or positivist conception that blocked out deeply related fields of inquiry. Thus diverse readings from many fields interact with formal legal materials to form a network of interrelated ideas. This range of readings is readily accessible to university students with academic backgrounds as varied as law, government, political economy, philosophy, education, theology, cultural studies, business or public health. Human rights\n\ncourses benefit greatly by including students from such varied backgrounds, as well\n\nas from diverse states and cultures. The first two editions served as the principal\n\ncoursebook in universal human rights courses in numbers of countries, in both graduate schools and colleges that included faculties and departments of law, government, and international relations.\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\nVii\n\n3. A book based on legal norms and institutions characteristically devotes great\n\nattention to the work of courts, the paradigmatic legal institutions. Particularly in Western liberal democracies, but also in a growing number of countries in the developing world, courts play a vital role in resolving human rights controversies and developing human rights norms, through constitutional and other bodies of law. However, where governments are authoritarian and repressive, where violations are serious, systemic and brutal, courts are least relevant. Relative to Western\n\ndemocracies, the judiciary’s competence to review executive or legislative action, or simply to resolve a controversy without political pressure, may be sharply reduced or eliminated, its jurisdiction limited, its decrees ignored, its judges subjected to threat or worse. The struggle for rights may become fully political, even forceful and violent, before the emergence of an open society with some semblance of the rule of law in which courts can independently function. For such reasons, in a book giving great attention to both the developed and developing world, to democratic and authoritarian societies, state courts in the large will play a lesser role than in the typical law course in settling major disputes affecting the nature of the polity, and in making and applying law. Nonetheless, even over the 12 years since the publication of the first edition, the importance for human rights of state constitutional courts has markedly increased. A whole field of comparative constitutional law that is worldwide in scope is emerging. During this same period, international tribunals as well as treaty committees with dispute-resolving powers have gained prominence and significance. For such reasons, judicial and quasi-judicial bodies play a larger role in this edition than in the two prior ones. 4. In vital respects, a book that concentrates on international human rights must assume that students have a rudimentary knowledge of international law. How else can a Class discuss matters like treaties and custom, intergovernmental institutions and processes, or internalization of treaty or customary norms within a state?\n\nNonetheless, a substantial percentage of students taking basic courses on human rights lacks that knowledge. How to handle this situation? In its early chapters, the book provides an introduction to basic conceptions, sources, processes and norms of international law. This introduction hardly achieves the depth and sophistication of a course devoted principally to that rich subject. But it suffices to enable students to grapple with the themes of the coursebook. 5. The study of human rights norms without attention to the international organizations that implement, develop, apply and enforce them would create an air of unreality about the entire enterprise. The architecture, powers, functions and\n\nprocesses of international human rights organizations, intergovernmental and nongovernmental, figure importantly in the book. The student is made aware through-\n\nout of the pervasive relationships among norms, institutions, and processes at the international as well as national levels. 6. No one substantive human rights problem and no one region dominates the book. The text and readings draw on many problems to illustrate their themes: free speech and the right to education; torture and discrimination against ethnic minorities; laws of war and the right to health care. The chapters illustrate those themes by\n\nviii\n\nPreface to the Third Edition\n\ndrawing on many parts of the world, developed and developing, internationally powerful and weak, and underscore conflicts among regions and cultures in their\n\napproaches to and understandings of human rights. Changes from the second edition Such changes are pervasive. Of course there has been updating of text and materials throughout, with related changes in emphasis and topics. Several themes absent from or marginal to the prior editions here figure importantly: human rights in relation to terrorism and national security; responsibility of non-state actors for human rights violations; recent substantial changes in sources and processes of international law; achieved and potential reform within United Nations human rights institutions; and theories about international organizations and their influence on state behaviour. Authors Ryan Goodman, Rita E. Hauser Professor of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law\n\nat Harvard Law School, and Director of its Human Rights Program, has become a third co-author and co-editor of the coursebook.\n\nPractical details and updates on materials Rather than require students to purchase a separate booklet, we have set forth basic documents like treaties, declarations and constitutions that are necessary companions to the coursebook’s materials in a Documents Supplement on a website associated with OUP and the book: www.oxfordtextbooks.co.uk/orc/ihr3e/. Most of these documents have been edited to eliminate sections not relevant to the coursebook’s discussions. The website will be periodically revised. We have sharply edited most of the primary and secondary materials in order to make the readings as compact as possible. Omissions (except for footnotes) are indicated by the conventional use of ellipses. Retained footnotes are renumbered within the consecutive footnote numbering of each chapter.\n\nAcknowledgements Philip Alston wishes to express his appreciation to Monika Heymann for superb research on Chapter 11, to Katie Young for advice on Chapter 4, to Mara Bustelo for advice on Chapter 9, and to Kelly Ryan for having coordinated the permissions and\n\nmuch else.

The boundaries of the subject are steadily expanding. Since the Second World War, the human rights movement that grew out of that war has become an indelible part of our legal, political and moral landscape. The book uses this term ‘movement’ to include governmental and intergovernmental as well as nongovernmental developments since 1945, unlike some contemporary usage that restricts the term to nongovernmental actors. Given the breadth and complexity of the movement, including its engagement with law, politics, morals and radically different cultures, the coursebook necessarily includes materials from a range of disciplines. The three principal themes of law, politics and morals are interrelated, indeed inseparable, for an understanding of the movement. The political and moral aspects of international human rights are self-evident; it is the international legal aspect that is novel. The rules and standards of contemporary human rights are expressed not only through states’ constitutions, laws and practices, but also through treaties and international custom, as well as the work products (decisions about action, forms\n\nof adjudication, studies, investigative reports, resolutions, recommendations) diverse international institutions and organs.\n\nof\n\nThroughout, the materials underscore the youth of this movement, and the task\n\nof students and others committed to its ideals is to see themselves not as apprentices learning about an established, even static, framework of ideas and institutions, but rather as shapers and architects of the movement’s ongoing development. The book’s goal is then not only to train students to work effectively within the present structure and boundaries of the human rights movement, but also to impart a broad as well as critical understanding of it, and to provoke ideas about the directions in which it may be or ought to be heading. The Preface sets forth the book’s pedagogical goals, conceptual structure and formal organization. Students may wish to read it now.\n\nl Human Rights Concepts and Discourse This introductory chapter assumes no special knowledge about the foundations or content of rights, human rights and international human rights. Rather it is meant to spur thoughts about a range of issues that later chapters examine. The two parts of the chapter explore these basic questions from complementary perspectives. Part A introduces human rights issues in the large, as they arise and become known. It is not attentive to courts, for in many of the situations it addresses, courts will play only a marginal role, if a role at all. The medium for looking at these issues 1s newspaper articles. Part B moves to an examination of the way that courts from different states address and argue about the alleged violations of rights that come before them. The common issue in Part B engaging these courts is the legality of capital punishment\n\nunder illustrative state laws and under the developing international human rights law. At the same time, these materials examine the growing attention of national\n\ncourts to foreign law, whether constitutional, or statutory or judicial decisions, to learn how other countries reason and decide about the permissibility of capital punishment (and many other issues). Those inquiries lead us to what many would\n\ndescribe as the ‘special case’ (or ‘situation’) of the United States with respect to human rights (and other fields), that involves so-called US exceptionalism or unilateralism.\n\nA. GLOBAL SNAPSHOTS The following excerpts from newspaper reports draw you into the diverse human\n\nrights problems that plague the world. Some but not all of them refer to rights, or\n\nhuman rights, and thereby indicate the current global currency of that term. After reading these reports, consider the following questions: What is the source of the rules or standards under which governmental, inter-\n\ngovernmental and nongovernmental organizations evaluate and criticize a\n\nstate?\n\nWhat different roles do the types of organizations referred to in these articles seem to play?\n\n4\n\nPartA. Background to International Human Rights Movement\n\nDeen a ee ee ee en\n\nHow would you identify the alleged human rights violation in each story? Are you clear in each story that (if the reported facts are true) there has been a violation? Does all conduct that you believe may violate a right address only individuals’ rights, or do rights of groups also seem relevant? Are (international) human rights violations committed only by states, or are nongovernmental forces and individuals also accused of such violations? Do all the stories involve governments as the direct violators of rights? What steps if any seem to be taken to influence or force a state to end violations?\n\nSTORIES FROM THE PRESS: WHAT RELEVANCE TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES?\n\n1. Turkish Laureate Criticizes French Legislation by Sebnem Arsu, New York Times, October 14, 2006, p. 5 Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist who won the Nobel Prize in Literature this\n\nweek, went on television Friday to criticize the French parliamentary vote that would make it a crime to deny that the Ottoman Turks’ mass killing of Armenians constituted genocide. In a telephone interview broadcast live on the private television network NTV, Mr. Pamuk, who faced criminal charges for his statements acknowledging the massacre, said France had acted against its own fundamental principles of freedom of expression. “The French tradition of critical thinking influenced and taught mea lot,” he said. “This decision, however, is a prohibition and didn’t suit the libertarian nature of the French tradition.” The legislation was approved by the lower house of Parliament, but it is uncertain whether the upper house will concur. [Eds. As of December 2006, the French Senate had not approved the legislation. | Some analysts fear that widespread anger against the French legislation may turn more Turks against joining the European Union. A Turkish opinion poll released in July showed a decline in support, to 58 percent from a high of 74 percent in 2003, in part because of the prolonged road to admission. Mr. Pamuk’s statement came after some in the country voiced suspicions that the award was politically motivated. Mr. Pamuk owes part of his celebrity in Europe to his criticism of Turkey’s stance on the Armenian genocide. Many in Europe feel that Turkey should acknowledge that the mass killings during and after World War I were genocide, and the country’s refusal may complicate its attempts to join the European Union. *\n\nMr. Pamuk was charged last year with making “anti-Turkish” remarks when he called attention to the Armenian genocide during an interview with a Swiss magazine. Turkish nationalists initiated the criminal case using a law that makes it a crime to\n\n1. Human Rights Concepts and Discourse\n\n5\n\ninsult Turkish identity. Europeans and others who decried Mr. Pamuk’s treatment said Turkey was violating his freedom of expression. After much outside pressure, the charges were dropped ona technicality. Sema Munuklu, 38, a restaurant owner, said .. . the French Parliament’s action displayed European hesitancy in accepting Turkey into the European Union. Ibrahim Unseli, 55, who runs an electronics shop, said he was as appalled by the French Parliament's attitude as he was by Mr. Pamuk’s position on the Armenians\n\nand added that he hoped that Turks would boycott French goods.\n\n2. US Human Rights Hypocrisy Attacked China Daily, May 22, 2004 Human rights experts and religious leaders spoke out on Friday against a recent series of US reports on China’s human rights situation, urging Washington to take a closer look at its own army’s abuse of Iraqi prisoners. Tian Jin, a member of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, said that the United States wanted to “achieve two goals” by publishing the reports. “It wants to add political pressure on China and demonize China.” The US Government had initially planned to issue its report entitled Supporting Human Rights and Democracy: The US Record 2003-2004, which looks at human rights in over 100 countries, on May 5. But publication was postponed until last Monday amid global fury over the disclosure of atrocities committed by US troops against Iraqi prisoners. “Against the backdrop of the US army’s abuse of Iraqi prisoners, the United States should have refrained from issuing such a report,’ Tian told\n\nChina Daily. He was echoed by Dong Yunhu, Vice-President of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, who described the US report as “ironic.”\n\nThe report has allowed the public to see clearly the double standards adopted by the United States concerning human rights and its pursuit for hegemony, said Dong. “The United States should stop interfering in other countries’ internal affairs by using human rights, and return to an equal dialogue on human rights, added Dong. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said that the United States should take a closer look at the state of human rights in its own country and think about how to improve this. Actions by the US should not violate human rights in other countries. China can be proud of its human rights achievements over the past decades, although there remains further room for improvement, added the spokesman. This year’s session of the National People’s Congress in March passed a constitutional amendment which states that China respects and preserves human rights. The United States and China have had a number of confrontations over human rights this year. The US State Department issued this year’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in February, which was once again critical of China. That was followed by a US-sponsored anti-China motion at the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which was thrown out by the participating countries on April 16. The recent US actions have prompted China to suspend its human rights dialogue with the United States.\n\n6\n\nPartA. Background to International Human Rights Movement\n\n3. As Nigeria Tries to Fight Graft, A New Sordid Tale by Lydia Polgreen, New York Times, November 29, 2005, p. 1\n\nPrecisely where\n\nin the rogue’s gallery of corrupt\n\nNigerian leaders Diepreye\n\nAlamieyeseigha will fall is a matter for history to judge. Gen. Sani Abacha, the military dictator who helped himself to at least $3 billion and salted it away in foreign bank accounts, doubtless stole far more.\n\nBut General Abacha — who ruled the country from 1993 to 1998 — never fled money-laundering charges in a foreign land by donning a dress and a wig to match forged travel documents, as Mr. Alamieyeseigha, the governor of a small oil-producing state in the Niger Delta, did last week, government officials said. For their sheer audacity, his antics are likely to earn him a prominent place among the leaders who in the past four decades are believed to have stolen or misspent $400 billion in government money, most of it the profits from Nigeria's oil reserves. Long associated with rampant corruption and kleptocratic governments, Nigeria has year in and year out gotten one of the worst scores in Transparency International's world corruption perception index, though this year its rating improved slightly. Corruption touches virtually every aspect of Nigerian life, from the millions of sham e-mail messages sent each year by people claiming to be Nigerian officials seeking help with transferring large sums of money out of the country, to the police officers who routinely set up roadblocks, sometimes every few hundred yards, to extract bribes of 20 naira, about 15 cents, from drivers. In the past year President Olusegun Obasanjo has ratcheted up the fight against corruption, and several high officials have been ensnared in criminal investigations.\n\n“Looting from the people is not a new thing,” said Kayode Fayemi of the Center for Democracy and Development, an advocacy group. “We are used to that. But for people who claim to be representatives of their own people to commit this barefaced robbery is shameful. Where is the rule of law?” “There is no real system of checks and balances,” said Anyakwee Nsirimovu,\n\nexecutive director of the Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law, based in the Niger Delta. “The legislatures owe all their allegiance to the governors, who control state money.” Here in Mr. Alamieyeseigha’s state of Bayelsa, that means serious money. Under a Nigerian law enacted to help develop the oil-rich but long-neglected Niger Delta, 13 percent of the revenue generated in any state is returned there for development. Bayelsa produces 30 percent of the country’s oil, and with recent sky-high oil prices, the state budget this year ballooned to $560 million, compared with nearly $300 million in 2003.\n\n. . Since 2002 the state has spent more than $25 million on the governor’s mansion, according to budgets on file in Yenagoa’s tiny public library. The fence enclosing the two houses alone cost $5.7 million.\n\n1. Human Rights Concepts and Discourse\n\n7\n\nMeanwhile, the Poverty Eradication Committee, whose purpose is not explained, has a budget of about $23,000, according to the 2005 spending plan, which is posted on the state’s Web site, www.bayelsagov.com. That is a little more than half of what is budgeted for toiletries for state officials.\n\n4. Study Finds Wealth Inequality is Widening Worldwide by Eduardo Porter, New York Times, December 6, 2006, Business Sec. p. 3\n\nExperts have long worried about the skewed distribution of the world’s income, with vast rewards massing in the hands of a wealthy elite and precious little left over for the vast majority of the global population. But even as income inequality has reached near record levels in many countries, the distribution of the world’s wealth — things like stocks, bonds or physical assets like land — has become even more narrowly concentrated than income, according to a new report by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University. In 2000, the top 1 percent of the world’s population — some 37 million adults with a net worth of at least $515,000 — accounted for about 40 percent of the world’s total net worth, according to the report. The bottom half of the population owned merely 1.1 percent of the globe’s wealth. The net worth of the world’s typical person — whose wealth was above that of half the world’s population and below that of the other half — was under $2,200.\n\nThe widening gap between the global haves and the have-nots in large measure reflects the failure of less-developed countries to develop, while rich countries —\n\nparticularly the United States — have experienced fast economic growth and a spectacular buildup of assets. “Developed countries have pulled ahead of the rest of the world,” said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who is a co-author of the new study. “With the notable exception of China and India, the third world has drifted behind.”\n\nAmericans have amassed much of the world’s treasure. According to the report, in 2000 the United States accounted for 4.7 percent of the world’s population but 32.6 percent of the world’s wealth. Nearly 4 out of every 10 people in the wealthiest 1 percent of the global population were American. The average American had a net worth of nearly $144,000, losing only to the average Japanese, who had $180,000, at market exchange rates; the average person in Luxembourg, who had $183,000; and the average Swiss, who had $171,000. By contrast, in 2000 the average Chinese had a net worth of roughly $2,600, at the official exchange rate. China, home to more than a fifth of the world’s population,\n\nhad only 2.6 percent of the world’s wealth. And India, with 16.8 percent of the world’s people, accounted for only 0.9 percent of the world’s wealth. Among Americans, wealth is distributed about as unequally as it is around the globe. The new study cited data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer\n\nFinances, which found that the richest 1 percent of Americans held 32 percent of the\n\n8\n\nPartA. Background to International Human Rights Movement\n\nnation’s wealth in 2001. (This excludes the billionaires in the Forbes list, who control\n\nroughly another 2 percent of the nation’s wealth.) This tops the inequity in every country but Switzerland, among the 20 nations that measure these wealth disparities and are cited in the report. And it vastly outstrips the inequality in the distribution of income. A recent study by Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, found that in 2004 the top 1 percent of Americans\n\nearned a higher share of the nation’s income than at any time since the 1920s. Still, that share was only 16 percent.\n\nIncome inequality shows few signs of abating in most countries. Still, there is evidence that the global gap in wealth may close somewhat over coming years. Paradoxically, the reason is the fast growth of China and Indi"
