        "text": "This article analyzes whether state and local public employees areoverpaid at the expense of taxpayers. In 2011, forty-one states struggled with a cumulative total of $120 billion in budget deficits.1 Many states identified excessive public employee compensation as a major cause of their fiscal duress and proposed: pay freezes; benefits reductions; privatization; major collective bargaining revisions; the elimination of collective bargaining; and constitutional amendments to limit pay increases. Each change was asserted to be a necessary antidote to the public employee over-payment malady. Wisconsin eliminated meaningful collective bargaining for most public employees, while the legislation passed and later repealed in Ohio would have seriously eroded the scope of bargaining and eliminated dispute resolution procedures and rights The data analysis, however, indicate that state and local public employees are not overpaid. Comparisons controlling for education, experience, hours of wo...\n\nAbstract Political action features as one of the most prevalent strategies unions in the United States, Britain, Germany, Spain, and Italy have pursued in their strife for revitalization. We examine six types of political action—links with political parties, voter mobilization, lobbying, social pacts, political strikes, and legal avenues—in five countries to understand better what drives unions' use of political action as well as the success of these actions across countries.\n\nWorker centers empower communities of workers that are challenging for labor unions to organize. This includes immigrant workers and other vulnerable workers in high turnover jobs. These centers often organize workers that fall within the definition of “employee” under the Depression-era laws designed to protect some forms of collective worker activity from employer retaliation. Although employees associated with these centers can benefit from labor law’s carrot, worker centers are not “labor organizations” subject to labor law’s vast reporting requirements and restrictions on associational behavior (labor law’s stick). We use an original study of worker centers’ filings to the Internal Revenue Service to reveal that worker centers are more similar to nonprofits, than labor organizations. Both First Amendment and labor law principles affirm the characterization of worker centers as organizations that are not subject to labor law’s stick. Providing worker centers access to labor law’s carrot, but not its stick, is particularly compelling given that they are operating at a historical moment when income inequality parallels New Deal levels and hostility to worker organizations and workers’ rights is pervasive. Our carrot-but-not-a-stick approach has implications for the vitality of American labor policy. It opens up space for emerging worker centers to expand their efforts to amplify employee voice and improve the working lives of the growing low-wage workforce.\n\nABSTRACT:Globalization has brought increased attention to the notion that labor rights such asfreedom of association—the right of workers to organize a union—are fundamental human rights. However, the vigorous opposition to freedom of association by US firms is largely ignored in the business ethics literature and exacerbated by compensatory corporate citizenship rating mechanisms that tend to mask labor rights deficiencies. I argue that because freedom of association is a hypernorm, instrumental to fully realizing basic human rights, labor rights and human rights are largely inseparable. Thus, respect for labor rights is a non-substitutable requisite of corporate citizenship. I conclude by providing examples of corporate labor relations strategies that respect freedom of association and business firms that are leading the way."
