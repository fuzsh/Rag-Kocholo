        "text": "Judges ad hoc of the International Court of Justice have been widely criticized for their supposed lack of impartiality. This criticism may seem all the more powerful if one takes into account that judges ad hoc were created as a means to avoid the Court’s bias and appearance of bias. However, recent developments in the appointment of judges ad hoc indicate that, far from being a detriment to the states’ perception of the Court’s impartiality, judges ad hoc are a means to enhance the perception that the Court as a whole is impartial. Such developments include the increased frequency with which former elected judges are appointed judges ad hoc, the practice of electing judges from the ranks of former (or sitting) judges ad hoc, and the appointment of nationals or non-nationals as judges ad hoc. The institution of judges ad hoc has come full circle, and should be regarded as fulfilling the function for which it was created.\n\n1 Under Art. 31(1) of the Court’s Statute, a state party to a case has the right to appoint a judge ad hoc if none of the Court’s elected judges is a national of that state, including cases in which an elected judge cannot sit in a case due to conflict. Art. 31(2) confers this right on a state which is the only party no national of which is already serving as a titular judge, while Art. 31(3) provides the same right in cases in which no national of either state party is an elected judge. By virtue of Art. 31(4), judges ad hoc may also be appointed in cases heard by a Chamber of the Court and, under Art. 31(5), if there are ‘several parties in the same interest’, they are considered to be ‘one party only’ in appointing a single judge ad hoc. Under Art. 31(6), judges ad hoc are equated to elected judges in respect of qualifications, incompatibility, and impartiality, must make a solemn declaration in open court and, after appointment, ‘shall take part in the decision on terms of complete equality with their colleagues’. The Court found states to be ‘in the same interest’ under Art. 31(5) in only two cases. See South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v. South Africa), Order of 20 May 1961, [1961] ICJ Rep. 13, at 14; North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment of 20 February 1969, [1969] ICJ Rep. 3, at 8. In the 1973 Fisheries Jurisdiction cases, the Court, although not consolidating the proceedings, found that Germany and the United Kingdom were in the same interest and, as a British elected judge was a member of the Court, Germany had no right to appoint a judge ad hoc. See Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Judgment of 2 February 1973, [1973] ICJ Rep. 49, at 51, para. 7. Similarly, the Court found the United Kingdom and the United States to not be in the same interest in the 1992 Lockerbie cases. See Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libya v. United Kingdom), Judgment of 27 February 1998, [1998] ICJ Rep. 9, at 13, para. 9. In the 1974 Nuclear Tests cases, Australia and New Zealand separately appointed the same judge ad hoc, and Art. 31(5) was not expressly discussed. See Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment of 20 December 1974, [1974] ICJ Rep. 253, at 255, para. 3; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment of 20 December 1974, [1974] ICJ Rep. 457, at 458, para. 3. In the 2016 Nuclear Disarmament cases, Pakistan, the only one of three respondents no national of which was an elected judge, did not appoint a judge ad hoc. See Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. Pakistan), Judgment of 5 October 2016, [2016] ICJ Rep. 552, at 556, para. 3. In the 2004 Legality of Use of Force judgments, the Court held, without explanation, that the judges ad hoc appointed by three of the respondent states, namely France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, could not sit with the Court to hear preliminary objections, as the Court already included elected judges of British, Dutch, and French nationality. See Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia v. Belgium), Judgment of 15 December 2004, [2004] ICJ Rep. 279, at 287, para. 18.\n\n5 Charlesworth, H., ‘Judge ad hoc of the International Court of Justice’, in McCormack, T. and Saunders, C.
