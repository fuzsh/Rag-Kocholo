Dec. 2, 1975.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nIn this panel discussion, participants offer a harsh indictment of the federal preoccupation with military priorities, which, over the course of the Cold War, led the U.S. to channel more than a trillion dollars into the military-industrial complex, when domestic economic and social factors are more relevant to our national strength and security.

Strong, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, asserts that the drive of the less-developed countries for a new international economic order should be viewed as comparable, in the larger historical context, to the drive of the less-privileged sectors of American society for equity and justice.

Schlesinger argues that the military equilibrium between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. is imperiled because of steady shrinkage in American military expenditures while Soviet investment only increases. He contends that this will lead other nations to gravitate toward the Soviet Union, leaving the United States isolated and beleaguered in a hostile world. Pacem in Terris IV: 10. 1 tape.

He urges a doctrine of \"thoughtful internationalism,\" for he believes the best interests of the United States are more effectively advanced by the processes of bargaining, negotiation, compromise, and accommodation.

She leads a discussion on how we can develop for our youth a model of adulthood that makes the struggle to grow up worth it. Transition of Youth Conference V. 2 tapes. [LC 76-742192].

Mar. 5, 1976.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nEdward Wynne, of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, contends that the erosion of the traditional sense of community in the American school can be attributed to such factors as increased mobility, larger bureaucratic structures, an emphasis on subject specialization, and changing expectations and goals. The result, he argues, is growing youth alienation and delinquency as young people who have not learned how to participate in society seek alternative answers.

Mar. 6, 1976.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nUniversity of Chicago professors George Anastaplo and Richard P.

Tyler notes that what appear to be good ideas in educational policy glow and fade with time, and though there is a tendency to impress a new program on society by legislation, human learning cannot be forced. In the discussion that follows, conference participants consider experiential learning, teacher training, media influence, the leadership function, and other areas of the teaching-learning process as they evaluate various strategies for improving the effectiveness of public education.

Watt, of the University of California at Davis, contends that the American philosophy of productivity is based on high wages and relatively low energy costs, while the reality of the situation is the exact opposite: an overabundance of labor and a shortage of energy. He describes the fundamental changes in our thinking he believes have become necessary for economic survival. 2 tapes. [LC 77-740409]. Category: SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES.\n\n737.

Mar. 12, 1976.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nDr. Mary Pendery, of the Veterans Administration Hospital in San Diego, identifies the classifications of alcoholism most commonly encountered by treatment specialists and describes their manifestations, citing one of the greatest sources of misunderstanding about alcoholism being the tendency to either lump all alcoholics together or to use extremely oversimplified categorizations.

Dec. 10, 1975.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nNicholas Hobbs, of Vanderbilt University, proposes the creation of a new national policy directed toward re-establishing the family as the primary caring, nurturing, and socializing agency of our society, to counteract policies that have weakened the family by providing external resources to take over its traditional responsibilities.

Sept. 27, 1976.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nAnthropologist Paul J. Bohannon, of the University of California Santa Barbara, contends that the family, as an evolutionary response to both human sexuality and child-rearing, is threatened by two fundamental changes which have focused on it simultaneously: the liberation of sex from the reproductive function through reliable contraception, and the redistribution of the social functions of the family among other specialized institutions resulting from technological change and population growth.

May 13, 1976.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nPsychotherapist Bruno Bettelheim believes that the modern middle-class American family suffers its most serious psychological difficulties as a result of the discrepancy between its present reality and its expectations of what it ought to be, expectations derived from conditions which existed in the past but are no longer characteristic of families, such as the need for all family members to stay and work together in order to avoid extreme emotional, social, and economic deprivation.

Rodino asserts that it would be unwise to expect the criminal justice system to spearhead programs that affect the basic social, educational, economic, or political values of large numbers of our citizens in an effort to reduce crime, for other agencies, with different skills and functions, are more appropriate for such programs. Instead, he argues, what the criminal justice system needs to function effectively is clear guidelines set by Congress and state legislatures as to its primary tasks and objectives.

Kennedy states his belief that every citizen has a civil right to safety, and that to argue that there can be no crime reform until society is reformed is to direct attention away from the significant steps government can take immediately to fight crime, such as developing a modern comprehensive federal criminal code.

Dec. 9, 1977.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nGarrett Hardin, of the University of California Santa Barbara, argues for restricted immigration on the grounds that it is imperative to achieve population stabilization; and that while accepting a large volume of immigrants may appear to be altruism, it actually is not, for it gives the sending countries no incentive to control their population and depletes the resources of the receiving country. Followed by discussion with Richard Arellano, Harry S. Ashmore, Walter Fogel, Ronald M. Green, David Heer, John Higham, Ezra Mishan, Joseph Schwab, Ivan M.

Bustamante, of Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City, contends that it is misleading to discuss immigration in terms of charity, for the benefits the United States has received from immigration over the years must be taken into account, especially in light of the complex relationship between the U.S. and Mexico and the unique nature of their 2,000-mile shared border.

The Immigration Debate: The \"Idealists\" vs. the \"Realists.\" Dec. 9, 1977.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nJohn Higham, of Johns Hopkins University, explains how current discussion about immigration policy merely recapitulates the same dynamic that has shaped the debate over the last century: \"idealists\" who oppose more immigration controls by citing universal moral values, and \"realists\" who favor stronger controls on pragmatic grounds. In the face of growing agitation for stricter controls, Dr. Higham suggests that the most the idealists can hope for is to keep the restrictionist movement from acquiring a regressive character.

Dec. 7, 1978.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nThe doctrine of freedom embraces the principle of entitlement: the idea that each person is entitled to basic economic necessities and the opportunity for full social and cultural self-realization. These words may frame our national mission, but the panelists in this discussion argue that they are idle words for a significant underclass in our society. Unfortunately, a guarantee of a full life for some requires a diminishment in the entitlements of others. The ethical considerations inherent in the problem of conflicting entitlements are discussed by Harry S. Ashmore, Leonard Boudin, Ramsey Clark, Cathleen Douglas, Abe Fortas, and Barbara Jordan.

Dec. 7, 1978.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nHarvard University's Vern O. Countryman argues against proposed reforms of the federal criminal code, suggesting that the bill being debated in Congress shows a disregard of Supreme Court rulings that criminal statutes must be specifically drawn and easily comprehended, undermines certain civil rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution, and represents an unjustifiable expansion of the reach of federal criminal jurisdiction.

While acknowledging the necessity for appropriate constraints, he argues that the unprecedented degree of accountability required from the Agency must not take the form of a straightjacket that prevents the gathering of vital information.

Dec. 7, 1978.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nJohn Hotis, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, admits that many of the excesses of the Bureau in the past stemmed from its own failure to evaluate its mission and responsibilities, but also lays some of the blame on the government for failing to provide adequate guidelines. He discusses efforts to provide legislation that will define the Bureau's responsibilities, and warns that a charter that imposes rigid restrictions governing every step of the investigative process could endanger the flexibility the F.B.I. needs to adapt to diverse situations.

Bork expresses his concern over what he sees as an irresponsible press that seems to believe the public's \"right to know\" gives them the right to publish anything, even things the public thinks ought not to be known. Professor Bork warns that the backlash such an attitude may create could lead to far greater restrictions on the press than are necessary or beneficial. Douglas Inquiry XII. 2 tapes.
