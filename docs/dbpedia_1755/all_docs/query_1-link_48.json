        "text": "This article considers whose interests may be at stake when a company claims its human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (echr). In order to do that, the article will first investigate whether it makes sense to conceive of companies as persons capable of having their own interests. It finds that it is possible to do so. The article proceeds to analyse the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in respect of claims regarding their companies’ right to property, free expression and respect for home, considering whether, when the Court assesses the proportionality of the alleged interference, it is the interests of the company claiming the rights that are at stake. The article concludes it is possible to understand the case law of the court as not necessarily placing the interests of the company in the balance when assessing the proportionality of interferences with the Convention rights of companies. The article suggests that such an understanding is ...\n\nThis study examines State obligations to prevent and redress corporate-related human rights violations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It discusses the evolving jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in two areas of international legal doctrine of particular relevance to the business and human rights debate: the application of international human rights obligations to non-state actors (the public-private divide); and the jurisdictional scope of international human rights treaties (the territoriality-extraterritoriality divide). The study revises and updates a 2010 contribution to the mandate of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Entities John Ruggie. The INTRODUCTION offers an overview of the global regulatory framework on business and human rights. PART B systematises the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the public-private divide in terms of two categories of State obligations: negative obligations to respect human rights in relation to corporations acting as state agents; and positive obligations to protect human rights in relation to corporations acting as third parties. PART C discusses the ECtHR’s approach to the extraterritorial dimension of State obligations to prevent and redress corporate-related human rights violations. The study discusses cases of direct extraterritorial jurisdiction (acts ‘performed’ outside the State’s territory) and extraterritorial effects cases (acts ‘producing effects’ outside the State’s territory), and their respective relevance to the business and human rights domain. Consideration is also given to the growing body of case law on the extraterritorial dimension of the human right to remedy, which remains a pressing concern in the business and human rights domain.\n\nThis Article focuses on tort law as an avenue to address corporate violations of international human rights law in The Netherlands. Tort law can be employed for several reasons. Tort law can serve a preventive function by discouraging certain unlawful behavior. In this sense, tort liability may act as a regulatory mechanism. Additionally, tort law offers redress for injuries suffered and therefore also serves a compensatory function. It is especially this latter characteristic of tort law that makes it an important tool of human rights enforcement from the perspective of victims of human rights violations. The question this Article seeks to answer is if and how Dutch tort law provides possibilities for transnational human rights litigation. By analyzing the Dutch legal system, this Article seeks to survey the possibilities this system might offer to human rights plaintiffs and litigators, and explore why claims of human rights violations under tort law still have not been brought be..."
