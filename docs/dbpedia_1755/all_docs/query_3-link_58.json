        "text": "In the case of Efstratiou v. Greece (1),\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with\n\nArticle 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of\n\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the\n\nrelevant provisions of Rules of Court A (2), as a Chamber composed of\n\nthe following judges:\n\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\n\nMr Thór Vilhjálmsson,\n\nMr N. Valticos,\n\nSir John Freeland,\n\nMr M.A. Lopes Rocha,\n\nMr L. Wildhaber,\n\nMr G. Mifsud Bonnici,\n\nMr D. Gotchev,\n\nMr P. Jambrek,\n\nand also of Mr H. Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy\n\nRegistrar,\n\nHaving deliberated in private on 2 September and\n\n27 November 1996,\n\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the\n\nlast-mentioned date:\n\n_______________\n\nNotes by the Registrar\n\n1. The case is numbered 77/1996/696/888. The first number is the\n\ncase's position on the list of cases referred to the Court in the\n\nrelevant year (second number). The last two numbers indicate the\n\ncase's position on the list of cases referred to the Court since its\n\ncreation and on the list of the corresponding originating applications\n\nto the Commission.\n\n2. Rules A apply to all cases referred to the Court before the entry\n\ninto force of Protocol No. 9 (P9) (1 October 1994) and thereafter only\n\nto cases concerning States not bound by that Protocol (P9). They\n\ncorrespond to the Rules that came into force on 1 January 1983, as\n\namended several times subsequently.\n\n_______________\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n1. The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission\n\nof Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 28 May 1996, within the\n\nthree-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of\n\nthe Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application\n\n(no. 24095/94) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the Commission\n\nunder Article 25 (art. 25) by three Greek nationals,\n\nPetros, Anastassia and Sophia Efstratiou, on 25 April 1994.\n\nThe Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48\n\n(art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Greece recognised the\n\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The\n\nobject of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts\n\nof the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its\n\nobligations under Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) and of\n\nArticles 3, 9 and 13 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 9, art. 13).\n\n2. In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33\n\npara. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicants stated that they wished\n\nto take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would\n\nrepresent them (Rule 30).\n\n3. On 10 June 1996 the President of the Court decided that, in the\n\ninterests of the proper administration of justice, this case should be\n\nreferred to the Chamber constituted on 27 September 1995 to hear the\n\ncase of Valsamis v. Greece (1) (Rule 21 para. 7).\n\n_______________\n\n1. Case no. 74/1995/580/666.\n\n_______________\n\n4. That Chamber included ex officio Mr N. Valticos, the elected\n\njudge of Greek nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43),\n\nand Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b));\n\nthe other seven members, drawn by lot, were Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson,\n\nSir John Freeland, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr L. Wildhaber,\n\nMr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr D. Gotchev and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in\n\nfine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).\n\n5. As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Ryssdal,\n\nacting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the\n\nGreek Government (\"the Government\"), the applicants' lawyers and the\n\nDelegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings\n\n(Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence,\n\nthe Registrar received the applicants' memorial on 24 July 1996. The\n\nGovernment considered it unnecessary to file one. On 9 August 1996 the\n\nSecretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate did not wish\n\nto reply in writing.\n\n6. In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took\n\nplace in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on\n\n26 August 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\n\nThere appeared before the Court:\n\n(a) for the Government\n\nMr P. Georgakopoulos, Senior Adviser,\n\nLegal Council of State, Delegate of the Agent,\n\nMrs K. Grigoriou, Legal Assistant,\n\nLegal Council of State, Counsel;\n\n(b) for the Commission\n\nMr M.P. Pellonpää, Delegate;\n\n(c) for the applicants\n\nMr P.E. Bitsaxis, of the Athens Bar,\n\nMr N. Alivizatos, Professor of Constitutional Law,\n\nUniversity of Athens, Advisers.\n\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Pellonpää, Mr Alivizatos,\n\nMr Bitsaxis and Mr Georgakopoulos.\n\nAt the hearing the Delegate of the Agent of the Government\n\nfiled certain documents.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. Circumstances of the case\n\n7. The three applicants are Jehovah's Witnesses. Petros and\n\nAnastassia Efstratiou are the parents of Sophia, who was born in 1978\n\nand is currently a pupil in the last three years of\n\nState secondary education at a school at Komotini.\n\nAccording to them, pacifism is a fundamental tenet of their\n\nreligion and forbids any conduct or practice associated with war or\n\nviolence, even indirectly. It is for this reason that\n\nJehovah's Witnesses refuse to carry out their military service or to\n\ntake part in any events with military overtones.\n\n8. At the start of the school year 1993/94 Mr and Mrs Efstratiou\n\nsubmitted a written declaration in order that their daughter Sophia,\n\nthen 14, should be exempted from attending\n\nschool religious-education lessons, Orthodox Mass and any other event\n\nthat was contrary to her religious beliefs, including\n\nnational-holiday celebrations and public processions.\n\n9. Sophia was exempted from attendance at religious-education\n\nlessons and Orthodox Mass.\n\nIn October 1993, however, she, in common with the other pupils\n\nat her school, was asked to take part in the celebration of the\n\nNational Day on 28 October, when the outbreak of war between Greece and\n\nFascist Italy on 28 October 1940 is commemorated with school and\n\nmilitary parades.\n\nOn this occasion school parades take place in nearly all towns\n\nand villages. In the capital there is no military parade on\n\n28 October, and in Salonika the school parade is held on a different\n\nday from the military parade. The school and military parades are only\n\nheld simultaneously in a small number of municipalities.\n\nSophia refused to parade on account of her religious beliefs.\n\n10. On 1 November 1993 the teachers' committee at her school\n\npunished her for her failure to attend with two days' suspension from\n\nschool. That decision was taken in accordance with Circular no. C1/1/1\n\nof 2 January 1990 issued by the Ministry of Education and\n\nReligious Affairs (see paragraph 14 below).\n\n11. On 11 November 1994 Sophia was again punished with suspension,\n\nfor one day, on the ground that she had not taken part in the\n\nschool parade held on 28 October 1994.\n\nII. Relevant domestic law and practice\n\nA. On religion\n\n12. The 1975 Constitution contains the following provisions:\n\nArticle 3\n\n\"1. The dominant religion in Greece is that of the\n\nChristian Eastern Orthodox Church. The Greek Orthodox Church,\n\nwhich recognises as its head Our Lord Jesus Christ, is\n\nindissolubly united, doctrinally, with the Great Church of\n\nConstantinople and with any other Christian Church in\n\ncommunion with it [omodoxi], immutably observing, like the\n\nother Churches, the holy apostolic and synodical canons and\n\nthe holy traditions. It is autocephalous and is administered\n\nby the Holy Synod, composed of all the bishops in office, and\n\nby the standing Holy Synod, which is an emanation of it\n\nconstituted as laid down in the Charter of the Church and in\n\naccordance with the provisions of the Patriarchal Tome of\n\n29 June 1850 and the Synodical Act of 4 September 1928.\n\n2. The ecclesiastical regime in certain regions of the\n\nState shall not be deemed contrary to the provisions of the\n\nforegoing paragraph.\n\n3. The text of the Holy Scriptures is unalterable. No\n\nofficial translation into any other form of language may be\n\nmade without the prior consent of the autocephalous\n\nGreek Church and the Great Christian Church at\n\nConstantinople.\"\n\nArticle 13\n\n\"1. Freedom of conscience in religious matters is\n\ninviolable. The enjoyment of personal and political rights\n\nshall not depend on an individual's religious beliefs.\n\n2. There shall be freedom to practise any known religion;\n\nindividuals shall be free to perform their rites of worship\n\nwithout hindrance and under the protection of the law. The\n\nperformance of rites of worship must not prejudice\n\npublic order or public morals. Proselytism is prohibited.\n\n3. The ministers of all known religions shall be subject to\n\nthe same supervision by the State and to the same obligations\n\nto it as those of the dominant religion.\n\n4. No one may be exempted from discharging his obligations\n\nto the State or refuse to comply with the law by reason of his\n\nreligious convictions.\n\n5. No oath may be required other than under a law which\n\nalso determines the form of it.\"\n\n13. A royal decree of 23 July 1833 entitled \"Proclamation of the\n\nIndependence of the Greek Church\" described the Orthodox Church as\n\n\"autocephalous\". Greece's successive Constitutions have referred to\n\nthe Church as being \"dominant\". According to Greek conceptions, the\n\nOrthodox Church represents de jure and de facto the religion of the\n\nState itself, a good number of whose administrative and educational\n\nfunctions (marriage and family law, compulsory religious instruction,\n\noaths sworn by members of the Government, etc.) it moreover carries\n\nout. Its role in public life is reflected by, among other things, the\n\npresence of the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs at the\n\nsessions of the Church hierarchy at which the Archbishop of Athens is\n\nelected and by the participation of the Church authorities in all\n\nofficial State events; the President of the Republic takes his oath of\n\noffice according to Orthodox ritual (Article 33 para. 2 of the\n\nConstitution); and the official calendar follows that of the\n\nChristian Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nB. On school matters\n\n14. Circular no. C1/1/1 of 2 January 1990 issued by the\n\nMinistry of Education and Religious Affairs provides:\n\n\"Schoolchildren who are Jehovah's Witnesses shall be exempted\n\nfrom attending religious-education lessons, school prayers and\n\nMass.\n\n...\n\nIn order for a schoolchild to benefit from this exemption,\n\nboth parents (or, in the case of divorced parents, the parent\n\nin whom parental authority has been vested by court order, or\n\nthe person having custody of the child) shall lodge a written\n\ndeclaration to the effect that they and their child (or the\n\nchild of whom they have custody) are Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n...\n\nNo schoolchild shall be exempted from taking part in other\n\nschool activities, such as national events.\"\n\n15. The relevant Articles of Presidential Decree no. 104/1979 of\n\n29 January and 7 February 1979 are the following:\n\nArticle 2\n\n\"1. The behaviour of pupils inside and outside the school\n\nshall constitute their conduct, irrespective of the manner -\n\nby act or by omission - in which they express it.\n\nPupils shall be required to conduct themselves suitably, that\n\nis to say in accordance with the rules governing school life\n\nand the moral principles governing the social context in which\n\nthey live, and any act or omission in contravention of the\n\nrules and principles in question shall be dealt with according\n\nto the procedures provided in the educational system and may,\n\nif necessary, give rise to the disciplinary measures provided\n\nin this decree.\"\n\nThe disciplinary measures laid down in Article 27 of the same\n\ndecree are, in increasing order of severity, a warning, a reprimand,\n\nexclusion from lessons for an hour, suspension from school for up to\n\nfive days and transfer to another school.\n\nArticle 28 para. 3\n\n\"Suspended pupils may remain at school during teaching hours\n\nand take part in various activities, under the responsibility\n\nof the headmaster.\"\n\nC. Appeals\n\n1. The right of petition\n\n16. Article 10 of the Constitution provides:\n\n\"Any person, or persons acting jointly, shall be entitled,\n\nsubject to compliance with the laws of the State, to submit\n\nwritten petitions to the authorities. The latter shall be\n\nrequired to act as quickly as possible in accordance with the\n\nprovisions in force and to give the petitioner a reasoned\n\nwritten reply in accordance with the statutory provisions.\"\n\nArticle 4 of Legislative Decree no. 796/1971 provides:\n\n\"Once the authorities have received the petition [provided for\n\nin Article 10 of the Constitution], they must reply in writing\n\nand give the petitioner all necessary explanations, within the\n\ntime deemed absolutely necessary, which shall not exceed\n\nthirty days from service of the petition.\"\n\n2. Judicial review\n\n17. Article 95 of the Constitution is worded as follows:\n\n\"The following shall in principle lie within the jurisdiction\n\nof the Supreme Administrative Court:\n\n(a) the setting aside, on application, of enforceable acts of\n\nthe administrative authorities for misuse of authority or\n\nerror of law.\n\n...\"\n\nAccording to the settled case-law of the\n\nSupreme Administrative Court, \"decisions of school authorities to\n\nimpose on pupils the penalties provided in Article 27 of\n\nPresidential Decree no. 104/1979 are intended to maintain the necessary\n\ndiscipline within schools and contribute to their smooth running; they\n\nare internal measures which cannot be enforced through the courts, and\n\nno application lies to have them set aside by the courts\"\n\n(judgments nos. 1820/1989, 1821/1989 and 1651/1990). Only transfer to\n\nanother school has been held to be enforceable and amenable to being\n\nquashed by the Supreme Administrative Court (judgment no. 1821/1989).\n\n3. Actions for damages\n\n18. Section 105 of the Introductory Law to the Civil Code provides:\n\n\"The State shall be under a duty to make good any damage\n\ncaused by the unlawful acts or omissions of its organs in the\n\nexercise of public authority, except where the unlawful act or\n\nomission is intended to serve the public interest. The person\n\nresponsible shall be jointly and severally liable, without\n\nprejudice to the special provisions on ministerial\n\nresponsibility.\"\n\nThis section establishes the concept of a special prejudicial\n\nact in public law, creating State liability in tort. This liability\n\nresults from unlawful acts or omissions. The acts concerned may be not\n\nonly legal acts but also physical acts by the administrative\n\nauthorities, including acts which are not in principle enforceable\n\nthrough the courts (Kyriakopoulos, Interpretation of the Civil Code,\n\nsection 105 of the Introductory Law to the Civil Code, no. 23;\n\nFilios, Contract, Special Part, volume 6, Tort, 1977, para. 48 B 112;\n\nE. Spiliotopoulos, Administrative Law, 3rd edition, para. 217;\n\nCourt of Cassation judgment no. 535/1971, Nomiko Vima, 19th year,\n\np. 1414; Court of Cassation judgment no. 492/1967, Nomiko Vima,\n\n16th year, p. 75).\n\nThe admissibility of an action for damages is subject to\n\none condition, namely the unlawfulness of the act or omission.\n\nArticle 57 of the Civil Code (\"Personal rights\") provides:\n\n\"Any person whose personal rights are unlawfully infringed\n\nshall be entitled to bring proceedings to enforce cessation of\n\nthe infringement and restraint of any future infringement.\n\nWhere the personal rights infringed are those of a deceased\n\nperson, the right to bring proceedings shall be vested in his\n\nspouse, descendants, ascendants, brothers, sisters and\n\ntestamentary beneficiaries. In addition, claims for damages\n\nin accordance with the provisions relating to unlawful acts\n\nshall not be excluded.\"\n\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\n19. The applicants applied to the Commission on 25 April 1994.\n\nThey alleged violations of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) and of\n\nArticles 3 and 9 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 9) and of Article 13\n\nof the Convention taken together with the aforementioned Articles\n\n(art. 13+P1-2, art.13+3, art. 13+9).\n\n20. On 16 October 1995 the Commission declared the application\n\n(no. 24095/94) admissible. In its report of 11 April 1996 (Article 31)\n\n(art. 31), it expressed the opinion that\n\n(a) there had been no violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1\n\n(P1-2) in respect of the first two applicants (twenty votes to eight);\n\n(b) there had been no violation of Article 9 of the Convention\n\n(art. 9) in respect of the third applicant (nineteen votes to nine);\n\n(c) there had been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention\n\n(art. 3) in respect of the third applicant (unanimously);\n\n(d) there had been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention\n\ntaken together with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 13+P1-2) in\n\nrespect of the first two applicants (twenty-three votes to five);\n\n(e) there had been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention\n\ntaken together with Article 9 of the Convention (art. 13+9) in respect\n\nof the third applicant (twenty-four votes to four);\n\n(f) there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention\n\ntaken together with Article 3 of the Convention (art. 13+3) in respect\n\nof the third applicant (unanimously).\n\nThe full text of the Commission's opinion and of the\n\nfive separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an\n\nannex to this judgment (1).\n\n_______________\n\nNote by the Registrar\n\n1. For practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printed\n\nversion of the judgment (in Reports of Judgments and\n\nDecisions 1996-VI), but a copy of the Commission's report is obtainable\n\nfrom the registry.\n\n_______________\n\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\n21. In their memorial the Government requested the Court to dismiss\n\nthe application as being unfounded.\n\nAS TO THE LAW\n\n22. Relying on Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) and Articles 3,\n\n9 and 13 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 9, art. 13), the applicants\n\ncomplained of the penalties of suspension from school that were imposed\n\nin November 1993 and November 1994 on the pupil Sophia, who had refused\n\nto take part in the school parade on 28 October - a national day in\n\nGreece - on account of her own and her parents' religious beliefs.\n\nThey relied on the Commission's opinion in the case of Arrowsmith\n\nv. the United Kingdom (application no. 7050/75, Decisions and\n\nReports 19, p. 19, para. 69), according to which pacifism as a\n\nphilosophy fell within the ambit of the right to freedom of thought and\n\nconscience, and the attitude of pacifism could thus be seen as a belief\n\nprotected by Article 9 para. 1 (art. 9-1). They therefore claimed\n\nrecognition of their pacifism under the head of religious beliefs,\n\nsince all Jehovah's Witnesses were bound to practise pacifism in daily\n\nlife.\n\nI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 (P1-2)\n\n23. Mr and Mrs Efstratiou alleged that they were the victims of a\n\nbreach of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2), which provides:\n\n\"No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of\n\nany functions which it assumes in relation to education and to\n\nteaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such\n\neducation and teaching in conformity with their own religious and\n\nphilosophical convictions.\"\n\nThe parents did not allege any breach of Sophia's right to\n\neducation. On the other hand, they considered that the above provision\n\n(P1-2) prohibited requiring their daughter to take part in events\n\nextolling patriotic ideals to which they did not subscribe; pupils'\n\neducation should be provided through history lessons rather than\n\nschool parades.\n\n24. The Government contested the parents' submission, arguing that\n\nthe school parade on 28 October had no military overtones such as to\n\noffend pacifist convictions.\n\nThey disputed that Mr and Mrs Efstratiou's belief could count\n\nas a conviction for the purposes of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2).\n\nThey added that the State's educational function, which had to be\n\nunderstood in a broad sense, allowed it to include in pupils'\n\nschool curriculum the requirement to parade on 28 October.\n\nThe National Day commemorated Greece's attachment to the values\n\nof democracy, liberty and human rights which had provided the\n\nfoundation for the post-war legal order. It was not an expression of\n\nbellicose feelings, nor did it glorify military conflict.\n\nCommunal celebration of it retained today an idealistic and pacifist\n\ncharacter that was strengthened by the presence of school parades.\n\nLastly, a pupil's temporary suspension had a negligible effect\n\non the annual programme of study and could not be regarded as a denial\n\nof the right to education.\n\n25. In the Commission's view, the convictions of\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were protected by Article 2 of Protocol No. 1\n\n(P1-2) and the school parade in question was not of a military\n\ncharacter incompatible with pacifist convictions.\n\nAt the hearing the Delegate added that the scope of Article 2\n\nof Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) was limited; the provision (P1-2) must enable\n\nparents to obtain exemption from religious-education lessons if the\n\nreligious instruction was contrary to their convictions, but it did not\n\nrequire the State to guarantee that all their wishes, even if they were\n\nfounded on their convictions, should be acceded to in educational and\n\nrelated matters. In this instance, the pupil had not been refused the\n\nright to education by being suspended for only a short time.\n\n26. The Court does not consider that it must rule of its own motion\n\non the question whether the pupil Sophia's right to education was\n\nrespected.\n\nIt reiterates that \"the two sentences of Article 2 [of\n\nProtocol No. 1] (P1-2) must be read not only in the light of each other\n\nbut also, in particular, of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention\n\n(art. 8, art. 9, art. 10)\" (see the Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen\n\nv. Denmark judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 23, p. 26,\n\npara. 52).\n\nThe term \"belief\" (\"conviction\") appears in Article 9 (art. 9)\n\nin the context of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and\n\nreligion. The concept of \"religious and philosophical convictions\"\n\nappears in Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2). When applying that\n\nprovision (P1-2), the Court has held that in its ordinary meaning\n\n\"convictions\", taken on its own, is not synonymous with the words\n\n\"opinions\" and \"ideas\". It denotes \"views that attain a certain level\n\nof cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance\" (see the\n\nCampbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1982,\n\nSeries A no. 48, p. 16, para. 36).\n\n27. As the Court observed in its judgment of 25 May 1993 in the\n\ncase of Kokkinakis v. Greece (Series A no. 260-A, p. 18, para. 32),\n\nJehovah's Witnesses enjoy both the status of a \"known religion\" and the\n\nadvantages flowing from that as regards observance.\n\nMr and Mrs Efstratiou were accordingly entitled to rely on the right\n\nto respect for their religious convictions within the meaning of this\n\nprovision (P1-2). It remains to be ascertained whether the State\n\nfailed to discharge its obligations to respect those convictions in the\n\napplicants' case.\n\n28. The Court reiterates that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2)\n\nenjoins the State to respect parents' convictions, be they religious\n\nor philosophical, throughout the entire State education programme\n\n(see the Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen judgment cited above,\n\np. 25, para. 51). That duty is broad in its extent as it applies not\n\nonly to the content of education and the manner of its provision but\n\nalso to the performance of all the \"functions\" assumed by the State.\n\nThe verb \"respect\" means more than \"acknowledge\" or \"take into\n\naccount\". In addition to a primarily negative undertaking, it implies\n\nsome positive obligation on the part of the State (see the\n\nCampbell and Cosans judgment cited above, p. 17, para. 37).\n\nThe Court has also held that \"although individual interests\n\nmust on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does\n\nnot simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a\n\nbalance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment\n\nof minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position\"\n\n(Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of\n\n13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 25, para. 63).\n\n29. However, \"the setting and planning of the curriculum fall in\n\nprinciple within the competence of the Contracting States. This mainly\n\ninvolves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to\n\nrule and whose solution may legitimately vary according to the country\n\nand the era\" (see the Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen judgment cited\n\nabove, p. 26, para. 53). Given that discretion, the Court has held\n\nthat the second sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2) forbids\n\nthe State \"to pursue an aim of indoctrination that might be regarded\n\nas not respecting parents' religious and philosophical convictions.\n\nThat is the limit that must not be exceeded\" (ibid.).\n\n30. The imposition of disciplinary penalties is an integral part\n\nof the process whereby a school seeks to achieve the object for which\n\nit was established, including the development and moulding of the\n\ncharacter and mental powers of its pupils (see the\n\nCampbell and Cosans judgment cited above, p. 14, para. 33).\n\n31. In the first place, the Court notes that Miss Efstratiou was\n\nexempted from religious-education lessons and the Orthodox Mass, as had\n\nbeen requested by her parents. The latter also wished to have her\n\nexempted from having to parade during the national commemoration on\n\n28 October.\n\n32. While it is not for the Court to rule on the Greek State's\n\ndecisions as regards the setting and planning of the school curriculum,\n\nit is surprised that pupils can be required on pain of suspension from\n\nschool - even if only for two days - to parade outside the\n\nschool precincts on a holiday.\n\nNevertheless, it can discern nothing, either in the purpose of\n\nthe parade or in the arrangements for it, which could offend the\n\napplicants' pacifist convictions to an extent prohibited by the\n\nsecond sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2).\n\nSuch commemorations of national events serve, in their way,\n\nboth pacifist objectives and the public interest. The presence of\n\nmilitary representatives at some of the parades which take place in\n\nGreece on the day in question does not in itself alter the nature of\n\nthe parades.\n\nFurthermore, the obligation on the pupil does not deprive her\n\nparents of their right \"to enlighten and advise their children, to\n\nexercise with regard to their children natural parental functions as\n\neducators, or to guide their children on a path in line with the\n\nparents' own religious or philosophical convictions\"\n\n(see, mutatis mutandis, the Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen judgment\n\ncited above, p. 28, para. 54).\n\n33. It is not for the Court to rule on the expediency of other\n\neducational methods which, in the applicants' view, would be better\n\nsuited to the aim of perpetuating historical memory among the\n\nyounger generation. It notes, however, that the penalty of suspension,\n\nwhich cannot be regarded as an exclusively educational measure and may\n\nhave some psychological impact on the pupil on whom it is imposed, is\n\nnevertheless of limited duration and does not require the exclusion of\n\nthe pupil from the school premises (Article 28 para. 3 of\n\nDecree no. 104/1979 - see paragraph 15 above).\n\n34. In conclusion, there has not been a breach of Article 2 of\n\nProtocol No. 1 (P1-2).\n\nII. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 9 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 9)\n\n35. Miss Efstratiou relied on Article 9 of the Convention (art. 9),\n\nwhich provides:\n\n\"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience\n\nand religion; this right includes freedom to change his\n\nreligion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community\n\nwith others and in public or private, to manifest his religion\n\nor belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.\n\n2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be\n\nsubject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and\n\nare necessary in a democratic society in the interests of\n\npublic safety, for the protection of public order, health or\n\nmorals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of\n\nothers.\"\n\nShe asserted that the provision (art. 9) guaranteed her right\n\nto the negative freedom not to manifest, by gestures of support, any\n\nconvictions or opinions contrary to her own. She disputed both the\n\nnecessity and the proportionality of the interference, having regard\n\nto the seriousness of the penalty, which stigmatised her and\n\nmarginalised her.\n\n36. In the Government's submission, Article 9 (art. 9) protected\n\nonly aspects of religious practice in a generally recognised form that\n\nwere strictly a matter of conscience. The State was not under an\n\nobligation to take positive measures to adapt its activities to the\n\nvarious manifestations of its citizens' philosophical or\n\nreligious beliefs.\n\n37. The Commission considered that Article 9 (art. 9) did not\n\nconfer a right to exemption from disciplinary rules which applied\n\ngenerally and in a neutral manner and that in the instant case there\n\nhad been no interference with the applicant's right to freedom to\n\nmanifest her religion or belief.\n\n38. The Court notes at the outset that Miss Efstratiou was exempted\n\nfrom religious education and the Orthodox Mass, as she had requested\n\non the grounds of her own religious beliefs. It has already held, in\n\nparagraphs 32-34 above, that the obligation to take part in the school\n\nparade was not such as to offend her parents' religious convictions.\n\nThe impugned measure therefore did not amount to an interference with\n\nher right to freedom of religion either (see, in particular, the\n\nJohnston and Others v. Ireland judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A\n\nno. 112, p. 27, para. 63).\n\n39. There has consequently not been a breach of Article 9 of the\n\nConvention (art. 9).\n\nIII. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 3)\n\n40. Miss Efstratiou went on to allege, without giving any\n\nparticulars, that her suspension from school was contrary to Article 3\n\nof the Convention (art. 3), which provides:\n\n\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or\n\ndegrading treatment or punishment.\"\n\n41. The Government did not express a view.\n\n42. The Court reiterates that ill-treatment must attain a\n\nminimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of\n\nArticle 3 (art. 3) (see, in particular, the Ireland\n\nv. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25,\n\np. 65, para. 162, and the Campbell and Cosans judgment cited above,\n\npp. 12-13, paras. 27-28). Like the Commission, it perceives no\n\ninfringement of this provision (art. 3).\n\n43. In conclusion, there has been no breach of Article 3 of the\n\nConvention (art. 3).\n\nIV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 13)\n\n44. The three applicants also complained of a breach of Article 13\n\nof the Convention (art. 13), which provides:\n\n\"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this\n\nConvention are violated shall have an effective remedy before\n\na national authority notwithstanding that the violation has\n\nbeen committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\"\n\nThey asserted that no effective remedy was available to them\n\nfor submitting their complaints and having the disciplinary penalty set\n\naside.\n\n45. The Government accepted that it was not possible to apply to\n\nthe Supreme Administrative Court to have the disciplinary measure -\n\nwhich was purely educational - set aside. Apart from the general\n\nremedies provided in the Constitution, the applicants could, however,\n\navail themselves of those provided by Article 57 of the Civil Code, for\n\ninfringement of personal rights, and section 105 of the\n\nIntroductory Law to the Civil Code, for compensation for damage\n\nsustained as a result of an unlawful act by a public authority. The\n\nprotection guaranteed by the courts therefore satisfied the\n\nrequirements of Article 13 (art. 13).\n\n46. The Delegate of the Commission pointed out at the hearing that\n\nthe remedies were inadequate as they presupposed a finding that the\n\npublic authority's act complained of was unlawful.\n\n47. The Court reiterates that Article 13 (art. 13) secures to\n\nanyone claiming on arguable grounds to be the victim of a violation of\n\nhis rights and freedoms as protected in the Convention an effective\n\nremedy before a national authority in order both to have his claim\n\ndecided and, if appropriate, to obtain redress (see, in particular, the\n\nfollowing judgments: Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978,\n\nSeries A no. 28, p. 29, para. 64; Plattform \"Ärzte für das Leben\"\n\nv. Austria, 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 11, para. 25; and\n\nVilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, 30 October 1991, Series A\n\nno. 215, p. 39, para. 122).\n\n48. The conclusions in paragraphs 34 and 39 above do not mean that\n\nthe allegations of failure to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1\n\n(P1-2) and Article 9 of the Convention (art. 9) were not arguable. The\n\nCourt accepts that they were. The applicants were therefore entitled\n\nto have a remedy in order to raise their allegations. On the other\n\nhand, as regards the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention\n\n(art. 3), on which Miss Efstratiou did not expand, the Court considers\n\nthat it contains no arguable allegation of a breach\n\n(see, mutatis mutandis, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom\n\njudgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, pp. 14-15,\n\nparas. 31-33).\n\n49. It must accordingly be determined whether Greece's legal order\n\nafforded the applicants an effective remedy within the meaning of\n\nArticle 13 of the Convention (art. 13) that enabled them to put forward\n\ntheir arguable complaints and obtain redress.\n\nIt was common ground that it was not possible to apply to the\n\nadministrative courts for judicial review. That being so, the\n\napplicants could not obtain a judicial decision that the disciplinary\n\nmeasure of suspension from school was unlawful. Such a decision,\n\nhowever, is a prerequisite for submitting a claim for compensation\n\n(see paragraph 18 above). The actions for damages referred to in\n\nArticle 57 of the Civil Code and section 105 of the Introductory Law\n\nto the Civil Code were therefore of no avail to them. As to the other\n\nremedies relied on, the Government cited no instance of their use\n\nsimilar to the present case, and their effectiveness has accordingly\n\nnot been established.\n\n50. Like the Commission, the Court thus finds, having regard to all\n\nthe circumstances of the case, that the applicants did not have an\n\neffective remedy before a national authority in order to raise the\n\ncomplaints they later submitted at Strasbourg. There has consequently\n\nbeen a breach of Article 13 of the Convention taken together with\n\nArticle 2 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 9 of the Convention\n\n(art. 13+P1-2, art. 13+9), but not taken together with Article 3 of the\n\nConvention (art. 13+3).\n\nV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50)\n\n51. By Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50),\n\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a\n\nlegal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting\n\nParty is completely or partially in conflict with the\n\nobligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the\n\ninternal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation\n\nto be made for the consequences of this decision or measure,\n\nthe decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just\n\nsatisfaction to the injured party.\"\n\nA. Non-pecuniary damage\n\n52. Mr and Mrs Efstratiou and their daughter each sought\n\ncompensation in the amount of 1,000 drachmas.\n\n53. The Government found the applicants' attitude \"remarkable\".\n\nThe Delegate of the Commission did not express a view.\n\n54. The Court considers that the applicants have sustained\n\nnon-pecuniary damage but that the finding of a breach of Article 13 of\n\nthe Convention taken together with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 and\n\nArticle 9 of the Convention (art. 13+P1-2, art. 13+9) is sufficient to\n\ncompensate them for it.\n\nB. Costs and expenses\n\n55. For the costs and expenses relating to the proceedings at\n\nStrasbourg the applicants claimed a sum of 4,500,000 drachmas.\n\n56. The Government questioned the amounts sought in respect of\n\nlawyers' fees and sundry expenses. The Delegate of the Commission\n\nexpressed no view.\n\n57. Having regard to the breach of Article 13 of the Convention\n\n(art. 13), the Court, making its assessment on an equitable basis as\n\nrequired by Article 50 (art. 50), awards the applicants\n\n600,000 drachmas in respect of costs and expenses.\n\nC. Default interest\n\n58. According to the information available to the Court, the\n\nstatutory rate of interest applicable in Greece at the date of adoption\n\nof the present judgment is 6% per annum.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n\n1. Holds by seven votes to two that there has not been a breach\n\nof Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2);\n\n2. Holds by seven votes to two that there has not been a breach\n\nof Article 9 of the Convention (art. 9);\n\n3. Holds unanimously that there has not been a breach of\n\nArticle 3 of the Convention (art. 3);\n\n4. Holds unanimously that there has been a breach of Article 13\n\nof the Convention taken together with Article 2 of\n\nProtocol No. 1 and Article 9 of the Convention (art. 13+P1-2,\n\nart. 13+9), but not taken together with Article 3 of the\n\nConvention (art. 13+3);\n\n5. Holds unanimously that this judgment in itself constitutes\n\nsufficient just satisfaction for the alleged non-pecuniary\n\ndamage;\n\n6. Holds unanimously that the respondent State is to pay the\n\napplicants, within three months,\n\n600,000 (six hundred thousand) drachmas for costs and\n\nexpenses, on which sum simple interest at an annual rate of 6%\n\nshall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned\n\nthree months until settlement.\n\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public\n\nhearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 December 1996.\n\nSigned: Rolv RYSSDAL\n\nPresident\n\nSigned: Herbert PETZOLD\n\nRegistrar\n\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention\n\n(art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the joint\n\ndissenting opinion of Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson and Mr Jambrek is annexed\n\nto this judgment.\n\nInitialled: R.R.\n\nInitialled: H.P.\n\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES THÓR VILHJÁLMSSON AND JAMBREK\n\nIn this case we find a violation both of Article 2 of\n\nProtocol No. 1 to the Convention (P1-2) and of Article 9 of the\n\nConvention (art. 9). In this we disagree with the judgment. On the\n\nother points set out in the operative provisions of the judgment we\n\nvoted in the same way as the majority of the judges.\n\nArticle 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2)\n\nMr and Mrs Efstratiou alleged that there is a breach of this\n\nArticle (P1-2) where pupils, like their daughter Sophia, are forced as\n\npart of their school duties to take part in organised events imbued\n\nwith a symbolism that is contrary to the most deeply held religious and\n\nphilosophical convictions of their parents. This applies even more\n\nwhere the events are held in a public place, outside school, on a\n\nnational holiday with the intention of delivering a message to the\n\ncommunity concerned. According to Mr and Mrs Efstratiou, the pupils\n\nare thus obliged to show publicly, by their acts, that they adhere to\n\nbeliefs contrary to those of their parents.\n\nIn our opinion, Mr and Mrs Efstratiou's perception of the\n\nsymbolism of the school parade and its religious and\n\nphilosophical connotations has to be accepted by the Court unless it\n\nis obviously unfounded and unreasonable.\n\nWe do not think that the opinions of Mr and Mrs Efstratiou were\n\nobviously unfounded and unreasonable. Even if their daughter's\n\nparticipation in the parade would only have taken up part of one day\n\nand the punishment for not attending was, in objective terms, not\n\nsevere, the episode was capable of disturbing both the parents and the\n\ngirl and humiliating Sophia. Commemorations of national events are\n\nvaluable to most people, but the Efstratiou family was under no\n\nobligation to hold that opinion with regard to the parade at issue in\n\nthis case. Neither is it an argument against finding a violation that\n\nthe participation was part of Sophia's education, because the nature\n\nof such school activities is not neutral and they do not form part of\n\nthe usual school curriculum.\n\nFor these reasons we find a violation of Article 2 of\n\nProtocol No. 1 (P1-2).\n\nArticle 9 (art. 9)\n\nSophia Efstratiou stated that the parade she did not\n\nparticipate in had a character and symbolism that were clearly contrary\n\nto her neutralist, pacifist, and thus religious, beliefs. We are of\n\nthe opinion that the Court has to accept that and we find no basis for\n\nseeing Sophia's participation in this parade as necessary in a\n\ndemocratic society, even if this public event clearly was for most\n\npeople an expression of national values and unity.\n\nWe therefore find a violation of Article 9 (art. 9)."
