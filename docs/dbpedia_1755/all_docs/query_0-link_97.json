Europeans arrived and started to lay claim to their lands, overpowering their political institutions and disrupting the integrity of their economies and cultures. The European encroachments frequently were accompanied by the slaughter of the children, women, and men who stood in the way. For many of the people who survived, the Europeans brought disease and slavery. Similar patterns of empire and conquest extended to other parts of the globe, resulting in human suffering and turmoil on a massive scale.1 As empire building and colonial settlement proceeded from the sixteenth century onward, those who already inhabited the encroached-upon lands and who were subjected to oppressive forces became known as indigenous, native, or aboriginal. Such designations have continued to apply to people by virtue of their place and condition within the life-altering human encounter set in motion by colonialism. Today, the term indigenous refers broadly to the living descendants of preinvasion inhabitants of lands now dominated by others. Indigenous peoples, nations, or communities are culturally distinctive groups that find themselves engulfed by settler societies born of the forces of empire and conquest. The diverse surviving Indian communities and nations of the Western Hemisphere, the Inuit and Aleut of the Arctic, the Aborigines of Australia, the Maori of New Zealand, the tribal peoples of Asia, and other such groups are among those generally regarded as indigenous. They are indigenous because their ancestral roots are imbedded in the lands in which they live, or would like to live, much more deeply than the roots of more powerful sectors of society living on the same lands or in close proximity. Furthermore, they are peoples to the extent they comprise distinct communities with a continuity of existence and identity that links them to the communities, tribes, or nations of their ancestral past.2 In the contemporary world, indigenous peoples characteristically exist under conditions of severe disadvantage relative to others within the states constructed around them. Historical phenomena grounded on racially discriminatory attitudes are not just blemishes of the past but rather translate into current inequities. Indigenous peoples have been deprived of vast landholdings and access to life-sustaining resources, and they have suffered historical forces that have actively suppressed their political and cultural institutions. As a result, indigenous peoples have been crippled economically and socially, their cohesiveness as communities has been damaged or 3\n\n4\n\nIndigenous Peoples in International Law\n\nthreatened, and the integrity of their cultures has been undermined. In both industrial and less-developed countries in which indigenous people live, the indigenous sectors almost invariably are on the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder, and they exist at the margins of power.3 Some indigenous groups were not severely affected, if at all, by colonization or its legacies until well into this century. Isolated tribal peoples in the Amazon, for example, lived mostly unaffected by outside forces until quite recently. In much of the Arctic, indigenous peoples were mostly left to continue lifestyles built around harvesting abundant wildlife resources within vast territorial domains. But even the most isolated indigenous groups are now threatened by encroaching commercial, government, or other interests motivated by prospects of accumulating wealth from the natural resources on indigenous lands or by strategic military concerns. History is repeating or threatening to repeat itself in the name of modernization, development, and security. In the face of tremendous adversity, indigenous peoples have long sought to flourish as distinct communities on their ancestral lands, and they have endeavored to roll back inequities lingering as the result of historical patterns of colonization. Armed resistance, diplomacy, and law have been tools in this quest for survival. Over the last several years especially, in conjunction with efforts through domestic or municipal arenas of decision making, indigenous peoples have appealed to the international community and looked to international law as a means to advance their cause.4 International law is a universe of authoritative norms and procedures—today linked to international institutions—that are in some measure controlling across jurisdictional boundaries. The central contention of this book is that international law, although once an instrument of colonialism, has developed and continues to develop, however grudgingly or imperfectly, to support indigenous peoples' demands. This book stands at the intersection of international law, indigenous peoples, and concern over the circumstances that have placed them in nondominant positions relative to other segments of humanity. Part I sketches the development of international law and its treatment of indigenous peoples over time, identifying the emergence in recent years of new norms within the law's burgeoning human rights program. Attention to international law's diverse temporal manifestations and evolutionary character is essential to understanding the contemporary movement in favor of indigenous peoples' demands and the tensions inherent in that movement. Part II describes the structure and content of contemporary international norms concerning indigenous peoples, emphasizing the principle of self-determination and its linkage to new and emergent norms. Finally, stressing that states and the international community at large have a duty to implement norms concerning indigenous peoples, part III identifies and evaluates existing mechanisms by which implementation may be secured or promoted.\n\nNotes 1.

A study by the United Nations contains the following definition: Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.

International law especially is rooted in jurisprudential strains originating in classical Western legal thought, although today it is increasingly influenced by non-Western actors and perspectives. The subject of indigenous peoples is not new to this genre of law but has figured with varying degrees of prominence in the legal discourse and practice related to international law's evolution over centuries. Discussions of indigenous peoples have appeared frequently in major treatises and published lectures contributing to the development of international law since the dawn of systemic European encroachment on distant lands half a millennium ago. This chapter discusses the historical threads of legal thought and official behavior that relate to the development of international law prior to the middle part of this century. It is not intended as a comprehensive history of international law and its treatment of indigenous peoples but is, rather, an effort to provide a contextual backdrop for assessing international law as it concerns today's indigenous peoples, the principal focus of this book. This historical backdrop demonstrates the evolving character and role of international law in relation to the patterns of empire and conquest that engulfed indigenous peoples. What we now call international law can be traced to the natural law philosophies of Renaissance European theorists, which were in some measure, although not entirely, sympathetic to indigenous peoples' existence as selfdetermining communities in the face of imperial onslaught. International law, however, shed its naturalist frame as it changed into a state-centered system, strongly grounded in the Western world view; it developed to facilitate colonial patterns promoted by European states and their offspring, to the detriment of indigenous peoples. An understanding of the steps in this historical evolution contributes to an appreciation of the dynamic nature of international law over time, and it provides a frame of reference for assessing the character and course of international law as it now develops relative to indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Early Naturalist Frame The advent of European exploration and conquest in the Western Hemisphere following the arrival of Christopher Columbus brought on questions of the first order 9\n\n10\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\nregarding the relationship between Europeans and the indigenous peoples they encountered. Within a frame of thinking traditionally linked to the rise of modern international law, prominent European theorists questioned the legality and morality of claims to the \"New World\" and of the ensuing, often brutal, settlement patterns. Enduring figures in this discussion were the Dominican clerics Bartolome de las Casas (1474-1566) and Francisco de Vitoria (1486-1547).' De las Casas gained notoriety as an ardent defender of the people indigenous to the Western Hemisphere who became known to the world as (the other) Indians. De las Casas, having spent several years as a Roman Catholic missionary among the Indians, gave a contemporaneous account of the Spanish colonization and settlement, vividly describing the enslavement and massacre of indigenous people in the early sixteenth century in his History of the Indies.2 De las Casas was particularly critical of the Spanish encomienda system, which granted Spanish conquerors and colonists parcels of lands and the right to the labor of the Indians living on them.3 Francisco de Vitoria, primary professor of theology at the University of Salamanca, joined de las Casas in confirming the essential humanity of the Indians of the Western Hemisphere. Never having traveled across the Atlantic, however, Vitoria was less concerned with bringing to light Spanish abuses against the Indians than with establishing the governing normative and legal parameters. Vitoria held that the Indians possessed certain original autonomous powers and entitlements to land, which the Europeans were bound to respect.4 At the same time, he methodically set forth the grounds on which Europeans could be said validly to acquire Indian lands or assert authority over them.5 Vitoria's lectures on the Indians established him among the often cited founders of international law.6 His prescriptions for European encounters with indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere contributed to the development of a system of principles and rules governing encounters among all peoples of the world.7 Vitoria's influence on later theorists is evident in the seventeenth-century work of Hugo Grotius, the most prominent of the \"fathers\" of international law.8 The early European jurisprudence concerned with indigenous peoples and associated with the early development of international law was the legacy of medieval European ecclesiastical humanism.9 This jurisprudence perceived a normative order independent of and higher than the positive law or decisions of temporal authority. 10 Conceptions about the source of higher authority, characterized as natural or divine law, varied. For Vitoria and other Spanish school theorists, God figured prominently as the source of legal authority, and law merged with theology.11 Grotius moved toward a secular characterization of the law of nature,12 defining it as a \"dictate of right reason\" in conformity with the social nature of human beings.13 This perceived higher authority, whatever its source, provided the jurisprudential grounds for theorists to conceive of and examine norms from a fundamentally humanist, moral perspective, and to withhold the imprimatur of law from acts of earthly sovereigns found to violate the moral code. Thus the early international law theorists were prepared to confront official practices and declare unlawful even the acts of monarchs when these acts were at odds with the perceived natural law. Further, the naturalist theorists viewed the law applying to sovereigns as part of an integrated normative order encompassing all levels of human interaction.14\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n11\n\nThe view of a suprasovereign normative order applying across all levels of humanity had been encouraged by a politically complex medieval Europe, in which the king's realm was but one among a maze of loyalties. The relationship of monarchs to large rural populations had been mediated from below by independent lords and sublords, while from above the pope and emperor asserted universalist claims to which the king was theoretically subordinate.15 In the Europe of the high Middle Ages, sovereignty and political loyalties were fragmented, resulting in shifting and overlapping political communities.16 Against this backdrop of evolving political interdependencies and the perception of a normative order applying throughout humanity, theorists discerned rights and duties as applying beyond limited denominations of human association such as \"nation,\" \"state,\" or \"kingdom.\" Within this historical jurisprudential frame, the threshold question for determining the rights and status of the American Indians was whether they were rational human beings. In his published lectures, On the Indians Lately Discovered (1532),17 Vitoria answered this question in the affirmative. He surmised that the Indians are not of unsound mind, but have, according to their kind, the use of reason. This is clear, because there is a certain method in their affairs, for they have polities which are orderly arranged and they have definite marriage and magistrates, overlords, laws, and workshops and a system of exchange, all of which call for the use of reason; they also have a kind of religion.18\n\nFrom this premise, Vitoria rejected the view that papal donation to the Spanish monarchs provided a sufficient and legitimate basis for Spanish rule over Indian lands in the Western Hemisphere. Pope Alexander VI had purported to grant the Spanish monarchs all territories discovered by their envoys that were not already under the jurisdiction of Christian rulers.19 And the Spanish monarchy had viewed this donation as establishing legal title to New World lands, in addition to entrusting the Spanish crown with the mission of converting Indians to Christianity.20 Invoking precepts informed by \"Holy Scripture,\" Vitoria held that the Indians of the Americas were the true owners of their lands, with \"dominion in both public and private matters.\"21 Neither emperor nor pope, he said, possessed lordship over the whole world. 22 Further, Vitoria maintained that discovery of the Indians' lands alone could not confer title in the Spaniards \"anymore than if it had been they who had discovered us.\"23 While unambiguously rejecting title by discovery or papal grant, Vitoria found more palatable the argument that the Spaniards could legitimately assume authority over Indian lands for the Indians' own benefit. Although Vitoria found the Indians sufficiently rational to possess original rights and dominion over lands, he entertained the view that they are unfit to found or administer a lawful State up to the standard required by human and civil claims. Accordingly they have no proper laws nor magistrates, and are not even capable of controlling their family affairs; they are without any literature or arts, not only the liberal arts, but the mechanical arts also; they have no careful agriculture and no artisans; and they lack many other conveniences, yea necessaries, of human life. It might, therefore, be maintained that in their own interests the sovereigns of Spain might undertake the administration of their country, providing them with prefects and governors for their towns, and might even give them new lords, so long as this was clearly for their benefit. 24\n\n12\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\nVitoria pondered this view with ambivalence. He said, \"I dare not affirm it at all, nor do I entirely condemn it.\"25 Nonetheless, the argument articulated but not adopted by Vitoria to justify Spanish administration over Indian lands was a precursor to the trusteeship doctrine later adopted and acted upon by nineteenth-century states.26 Of more generally foreboding significance, implicit in Vitoria's pejorative characterization of American Indians, was the measurement of cultural expression and social organization by the European standard: Although they met some standard of rationality sufficient to possess rights, the Indians could be characterized as \"unfit\" because they failed to conform to the European forms of civilization with which Vitoria was familiar. Against the backdrop of this Eurocentric bias, Vitoria ultimately constructed a theory of just war to justify Spanish claims to Indian lands in the absence of Indian consent. Within the early naturalist frame, Indians not only had rights but obligations as well.27 According to Vitoria, under the Roman jus gentium,28 which he viewed as either \"natural law or ... derived from natural law,\"29 Indians were bound to allow foreigners to travel to their lands, trade among them, and proselytize in favor of Christianity.30 In his lecture, On the Indians, or On the Law of War Made by the Spaniards on the Barbarians,31 Vitoria concluded that the Indians' persistent interference in Spanish efforts to carry out these activities could lead to \"just\" war and conquest. Vitoria counseled, however, against sham assertions of \"imaginary causes of war.\"32 Thus Vitoria articulated a duality in the normative construct deemed applicable to European contact with non-European indigenous peoples. On the one hand, the American Indians were held to have rights by virtue of their essential humanity. On the other hand, the Indians could lose their rights through conquest following a \"just\" war, and the criteria for determining whether a war was \"just\" were grounded in a European value system.33 The essential elements of this normative duality were advanced by other important European theorists of the period associated with the beginnings of international law, including Francisco Suarez (1548-1617), Domingo de Soto (1494-1560), Balthasar Ayala (1548-1584), and Alberico Gentilis (15521608).34 Writing a century after Vitoria, Grotius continued in this vein, although without specifically addressing the rights of American Indians. In his famous treatise, On the Law of War and Peace (1625), Grotius, like Vitoria, rejected title by discovery as to all lands inhabited by humans, \"even though the occupant may be wicked, may hold wrong views about God, or may be dull of wit. For discovery applies to those things which belong to no one.\"35 Further, Grotius affirmed that the ability to enter into treaty relationships is a necessary consequence of the natural rights of all peoples, including \"strangers to the true religion\": \"According to the law of nature this is no degree a matter of doubt. For the right to enter treaties is so common to all men that it does not admit of a distinction arising from religion.\"35 Grotius likewise endorsed the concept of just war,37 but in keeping with his secularized conception of the law of nature, he discarded the Christian mission as alone constituting grounds for war or conquest.38 Grotius identified three broad \"justifiable causes\" for war: \"defence, recovery of property, and punishment.\"39\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n13\n\nModern scholarship has established that in affirming the rights of indigenous peoples to land and an autonomous existence, these early theorists influenced the development of policies and legal prescriptions handed down by European sovereigns—although those policies and prescriptions were not always followed.40 This early affirmation of rights also can be seen reflected in the ensuing pattern of treaty making between the European powers and indigenous peoples.41 It has equally been established, however, that the theory of just war, colored by a European world view, provided enduring support for patterns of colonization and empire that exerted control over indigenous peoples and their lands.42\n\nThe Early Modern State System and the Law of Nations The emergence of the modern system of states in Europe prompted a revision of the framework within Western legal discourse for the treatment of indigenous peoples. The era of the independent territorial state began in earnest with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years War and the political hegemony asserted by the Roman Catholic Church.43 Along with the rise of the modern state came a marked evolution in naturalist thinking. European theorists transformed the concept of natural law from a universal moral code for humankind into a bifurcated regime comprised of the natural rights of individuals and the natural rights of states. This transformation has been called \"the most important intellectual development of the seventeenth century subsequent to Grotius.\"44 The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), in his major work, Leviathan (1651), posited that individuals lived in a warlike state of nature prior to joining civil society, represented by the state.45 Hobbes considered the state analogous to the individual as a holder of natural rights.46 Prominent theorists, including Samuel Pufendorf (1632-1694) and Christian Wolff (1679-1754) accepted Hobbes's vision of humanity as a dichotomy of individuals and states, and they began developing a body of law focused exclusively on states under the rubric the \"law of nations.\"47 The post-Westphalian concept of the law of nations approached its full expression in the writing of the Swiss diplomat Emmerich de Vattel (1714-1769), an avowed disciple of Wolff.48 In his treatise, The Law of Nations, or The Principles of Natural Law (1758),49 Vattel elaborated the idea of a discrete body of law concerned exclusively with states. Against the backdrop of a system of European state-societies, each of which claimed autonomy, he defined the \"Law of Nations\" as \"the science of the rights which exist between Nations or States, and of the obligations corresponding to these rights.\"50 Vattel adhered to the rhetoric of natural law and its presumptive universality, but viewed natural law as having distinct consequences when applied to states as opposed to individuals. 51 He developed a complex construct of the natural law of states, to which he added the positive law of treaties and custom among states.52 The individual/state dichotomy underlying Vattel's construct has powerfully affected the tradition of Western liberal thought. In contrast to the views of earlier\n\n14\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\nnaturalist theorists, the individual/state framework acknowledges the rights of the individual on the one hand and the sovereignty of the total social collective on the other. But it is not alive to the rich variety of intermediate or alternative associational groupings actually found in human cultures, nor is it prepared to ascribe to such groupings any rights not reducible either to the liberties of the citizen or to the prerogatives of the state. Instead, the theory and jurisprudence associated with the individual/state dichotomy assumes that the state embodies the paragon of human association and aspiration. This assumption is reflected in the Hobbesian theoretical justification for the state that Vattel adopted and set forth in his Law of Nations: The end or aim of civil society is to procure for its citizens the necessities, the comforts, and the pleasures of life, and in general their happiness; to secure to each the peaceful enjoyment of his property and a sure means of obtaining justice; and finally to defend the whole body against all external violence. It is now easy to form a just idea of a perfect State or Nation; all of its acts must concur in obtaining the end we have just pointed out. When men, by the act of associating together, form a State or Nation, each individual agrees to procure the common good of all, and all together agree to assist each in obtaining the means of providing for his needs and to protect and defend him. It is clear that these reciprocal agreements can only be fulfilled by maintaining the political association. The whole Nation is therefore bound to maintain it.53\n\nVattel's use of Nation and State as interchangeable terms throughout his work manifests a related and pervasive assumption that these two conceptual categories coincide. The concept of nationhood emerged in Europe to acknowledge, validate, and designate politically conscious groupings that were consolidated by monarchical rule and bound by common cultural, sociological, and ethnic characteristics.54 Statehood developed as a reference to the post-Westphalian political community and attendant bureaucracy, whose dominant organizing characteristic was territory.55 Statehood and nationhood converged as mutually reinforcing concepts and political phenomena, hence the term \"nation-state.\"56 The conceptual convergence of the nation and state was effectively a corollary of the individual/state perceptual dichotomy. Thus, Vattel, while using both of the terms nation and state, did not acknowledge their distinctiveness as conceptual categories by distinguishing their rights and duties. Beyond confining group autonomy rights to the categories of nation or state, the jurisprudential framework articulated by Vattel further advanced the theoretical primacy of the state by embracing notions that were precursors to the modern doctrine of state sovereignty. Vattel asserted that \"Nations [are] free and independent of each other, in the same manner as men are naturally free ... [and accordingly] each Nation should be left in the peaceable enjoyment of that liberty which she inherits from nature.\"57 Because nations are \"free, independent and equal,\" according to Vattel, each should be left alone to judge its own obligations, particularly in regard to its own citizenry.58 Vattel further held that the \"general and common right of nations over the conduct of any sovereign state is only commensurate to the object of that society which exists between them.\"59\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n15\n\nVattel thus articulated the foundation for the doctrine of state sovereignty, which, with its corollaries of exclusive jurisdiction, territorial integrity, and nonintervention in domestic affairs, developed into a central precept of international law.60 Unlike many exaltations of state sovereignty in later international discourse, however, Vattel did not appear to view the state in isolation from its theoretical human underpinnings. Vattel's injunction of noninterference and exclusive jurisdiction was based on idealized notions of the state as corresponding to the autonomous nation and embodying civil society, formed consensually by individuals in their own interests of comfort and self-preservation. For Vattel the state was free, independent, and equal as a result of the natural rights of its individual constituents. And the state's attributes of sovereignty were a means of maximizing the interests of the corresponding nation, a group of more or less homogeneous individuals joined in social compact. Vattel's affirmations of sovereign equality and independence of states, therefore, were in effect naturalist prescriptions based on an assessment of human interests, however misguided that assessment may have been.61 In any case, inasmuch as the normative construct envisioned by Vattel was wedded to the individual/state perceptual dichotomy, an assessment of their place within the dichotomy would be crucial to applying that construct in the context of indigenous peoples. To enjoy any rights as distinct communities, indigenous peoples would have to be regarded as nations or states. Otherwise, indigenous peoples would be conceptually reduced to their individual constituents, presumably in a state of nature, and their rights of group autonomy would not be accounted for. Moreover, as a matter of definition, indigenous peoples could not enjoy rights or duties under the \"Law of Nations\" unless they qualified as nations or states, or, perhaps more accurately, nationstates. The very idea of the nation-state would always make it difficult for nonEuropean aboriginal peoples to qualify as such. The concept of the nation-state in the post-Westphalian sense is based on European models of political and social organization whose dominant defining characteristics are exclusivity of territorial domain and hierarchical, centralized authority. 62 By contrast, indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere, at least prior to European contact, typically have been organized primarily by tribal or kinship ties, have had decentralized political structures often linked in confederations, and have enjoyed shared or overlapping spheres of territorial control.63 As an example of life in the state of nature, Hobbes had described \"the savage people in many places of the Americas\" who \"except the government of small Families . . . have no government at all; and live at this day in that brutish manner.\" 54 This characterization resembles that advanced earlier by Vitoria, even though for Vitoria the existence and content of indigenous peoples' rights was not directly a function of whether or not they qualified as states.65 Vattel himself defined states broadly to include all \"political bodies, societies of men who have united together and combined their forces, in order to procure their mutual welfare and security.\"66 Vattel clearly believed at least some non-European aboriginal peoples qualified as states or nations with rights as such. Bringing into question European expansionism in the Americas, Vattel remarked:\n\n16\n\nDevelopments over Time Those ambitious Europeans States which attacked the American Nations and subjected them to their avaricious rule, in order, as they said, to civilize them, and have them instructed in the true religion—those usurpers, I say, justified themselves by a pretext equally unjust and ridiculous.67\n\nEven Vattel's broad definition of the state or nation, however, is conditioned by a basic prejudice favoring the values behind European political and social organization. This European perspective is evident in Vattel's distinction between the \"civilized Empires of Peru and Mexico\" (evidently referring to the Incas and the Aztecs) and the North American \"peoples of those vast tracts of land [who] rather roamed over them than inhabited them.\"68 As to the former, \"conquest. . . was a notorious usurpation, [while] the establishment of various colonies upon the continent of North America might, if done within just limits, have been entirely lawful.\"69 Vattel seemed to distinguish between forms of indigenous society by accepting a Lockean natural law duty to cultivate the soil.70 Although he did not hold expressly that a society based on sedentary pursuits was a prerequisite for statehood, he did accept the view that cultivating land established a greater right to the land than did hunting or gathering. Later theorists expanded upon the distinction between sedentary and hunter-gatherer societies as a basis for denying indigenous peoples not only land rights but also status as nations or states subject to international law.71 Vattel's ambiguity on the status of indigenous peoples was compounded by his statements on the condition of political communities falling under the authority of others. On the one hand Vattel held that a state does not lose its sovereignty or independent status by placing itself under the protection of another as long as it retains its powers of self-government.72 On the other hand Vattel stated, almost as if to beg the question, that once \"a people . . . has passed under the rule of another, [it] is no longer a State, and does not come directly under the Law of Nations. Of this character were the Nations and the Kingdoms which the Romans subjected to their Empire.\"73 The ambiguities and tensions brought on by the state-centered law of nations were reflected in the United States Supreme Court's early decisions on the American Indians, decisions figuring prominently in the fabric of international jurisprudence concerning indigenous peoples. These decisions came half a century after Vattel's writing, at a time when the young country, founded on natural law visions of civil society, had yet to reconcile the anomalous existence of the Indians within its asserted boundaries. Three decisions, each written by Chief Justice John Marshall, were substantially framed by the question of the status of indigenous peoples within the Vattellian version of international law. Divergent tendencies appear in these early nineteenth-century U.S. Supreme Court decisions.74 One tendency viewed tribal societies as not qualifying as nations or states and hence as without full rights to group autonomy or ancestral lands. This tendency dominated in the first of the Marshall trilogy, Johnson v. M'Intosh,75 in which Marshall, following Vattel's preference for sedentary peoples, described the Indians as fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country, was to leave the country\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n17\n\na wilderness; to govern them as a distinct people was impossible, because they were as brave and high-spirited as they were fierce, and were ready to repel by arms every attempt on their independence.76\n\nReasoning from this characterization of the Indians, Marshall justified upholding superior United States title to Indian lands on the basis of discovery alone: However extravagant the pretension of converting the discovery of an inhabited country into conquest may appear; if the principle has been asserted in the first instance, and afterwards sustained; if a country has been acquired and held under it; if the property of the great mass of the community originates in it, it becomes the law of the land, and cannot be questioned.77\n\nMarshall's acceptance of the \"pretension\" of discovery, however, was equivocating. Marshall, whose jurisprudence incorporated natural law and the law of nations,78 suggested that he was not necessarily endorsing the diminishment of Indian rights in favor of the European discoverer merely on the basis of discovery; rather, he was deferring to U.S. assertions of title by discovery as required by the limits of domestic judicial competency: However this restriction may be opposed to natural right, and to the usages of civilized nations, yet, if it be indispensable to that system under which the country has been settled, and be adapted to the actual conditions of the two people, it may, perhaps, be supported by reason, and certainly cannot be rejected by Courts of justice.79\n\nMarshall's ambiguity continued in a different course in a second case, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia,90 in which he likened the Indian tribes to \"domestic dependent nations.... Their relationship to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.\"81 This characterization followed Marshall's holding that the Cherokee people did not qualify as a \"foreign state\" under the provision of Article III of the U.S. Constitution, a provision entitling a foreign government to invoke the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. Marshall's designation of qualified nationhood outside the scope of Article III, however, did not clearly identify the tribes as inherently inferior or as having a status necessarily outside the scope of the law of nations. Marshall's narrow interpretation of the term \"foreign state\" as used in Article III of the Constitution rested substantially on the Constitution's specific reference elsewhere to \"Indian tribes\" and the particular treaty relationship between the Cherokee and the United States.82 Marshall stressed that the Indians \"acknowledge themselves, in their treaties, to be under the protection of the United States.\"83 This characterization of relationships between the tribes and the United States is consistent with a view of the tribes as nations or states possessing the prerogative under the law of nations to consent to the protection of another sovereign. Marshall again wrote for the Court in Worcester v. Georgia,84 another case involving the Cherokee, and seemingly settled on the view that native tribes within the boundaries of the United States qualified as polities subject to the law of nations. Marshall emphasized the common reference to the tribes as \"nations\" and, citing Vattel, compared them to the \"[t]ributary and feudatory states\" of Europe,85 which Vattel held to rank among sovereign states subject to the law of nations despite their\n\n18\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\nhaving assented to the protection of a stronger power. Accordingly, Marshall applied principles clearly identifiable with the teachings of the early international legal theorists. Marshall upheld the \"original natural rights\" of Indians over their lands, which they could not lose by discovery alone.86 Voluntary cession and actual conquest, as with other nations of the world, were the bases for gauging whether an Indian tribe had been divested of its rights.87 And in the absence of actual conquest, the United States' protectorate over the tribes was a matter of treaty relationship, not unilateral imposition.88 In Worcester, Marshall clarified, or perhaps revised, his earlier statements on the effects of European discovery of Indian lands. Marshall discussed the European practice whereby the first power among them to lay claim to Indian land had the sole right of acquiring it from the Indians, and the Indians could not convey rights in the land to others. Marshall characterized this principle, the \"discovery doctrine,\" not only as a limitation for the Indians but also as \"a restriction which those European potentates imposed on themselves.\"89 According to Marshall, the principle \"regulated the right given by discovery among the European discoverers, but could not affect the rights of those already in possession, either as aboriginal occupants, or as occupants by virtue of a discovery made before the memory of man.\"90 Marshall suggested that the discovery principle, based on consent among states representing only a subset of humanity, was distinct from the natural rights accruing to the Indians independently of the will of states. The distinction is consistent with the view of the classical theorists that the positive customary law is subordinate to the law of nature. Marshall's assessment in Worcester of the status of Indian tribes, although sui generis, no doubt was influenced by the character of the tribe involved in that case, the Cherokee Nation. With several of their leaders educated in Christian missionary schools, the Cherokee had adopted Western forms of governance and land use, and had otherwise borrowed heavily from Anglo-American or European ways.91 In Johnson v. M'Intosh, Marshall had declined to discuss the merits of arguments that would deny rights to Indians because of nonsedentary or non-European ways.92 But in Worcester Marshall stressed the \"national character\" and self-governing capacity of the Cherokee,93 and he described the Cherokee as \"a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately described.\"94 It can thus be said that the Cherokee for Marshall approximated the description of political community that Vattel and other Western theorists of the period seemed most comfortable in denominating nations or states. Certainly many, if not most, Indian tribes were unlike the Cherokee and instead remained closer to what Marshall saw in Johnson v. M'Intosh as societies \"whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country was to leave the country a wilderness.\"95 Wheaton, the Supreme Court reporter and a friend of Marshall, stated what Marshall declined to adopt expressly. In his classic treatise, Elements of International Law (1846), Wheaton discussed the Marshall decisions concerning the rights of \"Indian nations,\"96 apparently placing Indian peoples like the Cherokee among the subjects of the law of nations, which by then was also called international law. At the same time, Wheaton excluded from the subjects of international law \"an unsettled\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n19\n\nhorde of wandering savages not yet formed into civil society. The legal idea of the state necessarily implies that of the habitual obedience of its members to those persons in whom superiority is vested, and a fixed abode, and definite territory belonging to the people by whom it is occupied.\"97 Wheaton thus signaled the ensuing dominance of the political and jurisprudential tendency to deny indigenous peoples status, and hence protection, under international law unless they fit within narrow categories of political and social organization and land use.98 To see tribes as \"states\" would in the end prove all too difficult for Western eyes.\n\nThe Positivists' International Law Not long after the Marshall decisions, international law abandoned consideration of indigenous peoples as political bodies with rights under international law, yielding to the forces of colonization and empire as Western colonizers consolidated indigenous lands within their respective spheres of political hegemony and control. The major premises of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century positivist school ensured that the law of nations, or international law, would become a legitimizing force for colonization and empire rather than a liberating one for indigenous peoples. The first of these major premises, which had been expressed by Vattel and reflected in Marshall's Supreme Court opinions, was that international law is concerned only with the rights and duties of states. A second and related premise, also derived from Vattel's framework, was that international law upholds the exclusive sovereignty of states, which are presumed to be equal and independent, and thus guards the exercise of that sovereignty from outside interference.99 The positivist formulation, however, parted company with Vattel's view that the law of nations embraces natural law and presumptively applies universally to all self-governing political bodies. Accordingly, a third premise at the core of the positivist school was that international law is law between and not above states, finding its theoretical basis in their consent.100 And a fourth premise—the culmination of earlier tendencies to conceptualize the state in narrow terms—was that the states that make international law and possess rights and duties under it make up a limited universe that excludes a priori indigenous peoples outside the mold of European civilization.101 Positivism drove this fourth premise to a theory of recognition under which statehood for international law purposes depended on recognition by nineteenth-century European and European-derived states.102 These premises meant that Indian tribes and other indigenous peoples, not qualifying as states, could not participate in the shaping of international law, nor could they look to it to affirm the rights that had once been deemed to inhere in them by natural or divine law. States, on the other hand, both shaped the rules of international law and enjoyed rights under it largely independently of natural law considerations. It followed that states could create doctrine to affirm and perfect their claims over indigenous territories as a matter of international law and treat the indigenous inhabitants according to domestic policies, shielded from uninvited outside scrutiny by\n\n20\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\ninternational law itself. State sovereignty, originally conceived of to advance human interests, would be a conceptual means by which international law could enter into complicity with inhumane forces. Late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century theorists relied upon the positivist construct of international law to provide the imprimatur of law for conditions of dubious legitimacy. The construct not only upheld the territorial bases of the American states, but also limited the parameters of international concern over the ongoing colonization of Africa and other non-European territories. The British publicist John Westlake, in his Chapters on the Principles of International Law (1894), provided one of the most complete expositions of the positivistic justification for the categorical exclusion of indigenous peoples as subjects of international law. Westlake distinguished between \"civilised and uncivilised humanity\" and viewed \"international society\" as limited to the civilized.103 In no uncertain terms, he deemed European-style government and sedentary lifestyle the test of \"civilisation.\"104 Westlake's rationale for imposing the requirement of European-style government is extravagant and worth quoting at length: When people of the European race come into contact with American or African tribes, the prime necessity is a government under the protection of which the former may carry on the complex life to which they have been accustomed in their homes, which may prevent that life from being disturbed by contests between different European powers for supremacy on the same soil, and which may protect the natives in the enjoyment of a security and well-being at least not less than they enjoyed before the arrival of the strangers. Can the natives furnish such a government, or can it be looked for from the Europeans alone? In the answer to that question lies, for international law, the difference between civilisation and want of it. . . . The inflow of the white race cannot be stopped where there is land to cultivate, ore to be mined, commerce to be developed, sport to enjoy, curiosity to be satisfied. If any fanatical admirer of savage life argued that the whites ought to be kept out, he would only be driven to the same conclusion by another route, for a government on the spot would be necessary to keep them out. Accordingly international law has to treat such natives as uncivilised.105\n\nWestlake's rationalization effectively admitted that international law was an instrument of the \"white\" and powerful colonizer. Not being among the \"civilised\" and powerful forces of colonization, indigenous peoples could not look to international law to thwart those forces. Indigenous peoples' rights had no place in the discussion. According to Westlake: When again men like Victoria, Soto and Covarruvias maintained the cause of the American and African natives against the kings and peoples of Spain and Portugal, they were not so much impugning the title of their country as trying to influence its conduct, they were the worthy predecessors of those who now make among us the honourable claim to be \"friends of the aborigines.\" Then and now such men occupy a field to which international law may be said to invite them by keeping itself within its own limits. Even those who, in accordance with the modern tendency, make rights instead of law their starting point, can hardly avoid admitting that rights which are common to civilised and uncivilised humanity are not among those which it is the special function of international right to develop and protect. . . .\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n21\n\n... This is true, and it does not mean that all rights are denied to such natives, but that the appreciation of their rights is left to the conscience of the state within whose recognized territorial sovereignty they are comprised, the rules of the international society existing only for the purposes of regulating the mutual conduct of its members.106\n\nThrough the early part of this century, the major international law publicists repeated the view that indigenous peoples had no status or rights in international law. The later writers, apparently more confident in this view's acceptance, dispensed with the lengthy rationalization that Westlake devoted to it. Among the later publications was the 1924 edition of W. E. Hall's A Treatise on International Law, which saw the exclusion of indigenous peoples from international law's subjects as simply a necessary result of the positivist conception of international law as law by the states and for the states of European origin: It is scarcely necessary to point out that as international law is a product of the special civilisation of modern Europe, and forms a highly artificial system of which the principles cannot be supposed to be understood or recognised by countries differently civilised, such states only can be presumed to be subject to it as are inheritors of that civilisation.107\n\nIn the 1920 edition of the noted jurist Lassa Oppenheim's International Law, the basis for excluding indigenous peoples from among the subjects of international law was reduced to their subjective nonrecognition by those within the \"Family of Nations.\" According to Oppenheim's treatise, \"As the basis of the Law of Nations is the common consent of the civilised States, statehood alone does not imply membership of the Family of Nations. ... Through recognition only and exclusively a State becomes an International Person and a subject of International Law.\"108 Oppenheim's influential work thus embraced what became known as the constitutive theory of recognition of statehood, by which statehood does not exist in international law until the moment of recognition.109 Given the circularity of describing the members of the \"Family of Nations\" (the states with \"international personality\") as those states recognized by the Family of Nations, Oppenheim's treatise was driven to list them.110 Prominent among the privileged few were the \"old Christian States of Western Europe\" and \"the body of Christian States which grew up outside Europe,\" including \"the American States which arose out of colonies of European States.\"111 Oppenheim further included the two \"non-Christian\" states of Turkey and Japan, while excluding \"such states as Persia, Siam, China, Abyssinia, and the like\" because they had failed to \"raise their civilisation to the level of that of the Western\" states.112 Eliminating whatever ambiguity remained about the status of Indian tribes and similar indigenous peoples, Oppenheim's treatise added expressly, echoing words previously heard, that the law of nations does not apply \"to organized wandering tribes.\"113 Some positivist theorists of the period went beyond merely excluding indigenous peoples from among the subjects of international law in order to maintain their vision of international law as law made by states and for states, to the virtual exclusion of indigenous peoples' territorial or sovereign rights. Despite the views of earlier theorists contemporaneous with a practice of treaty making between indigenous\n\n22\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\npeoples and European powers, positivist theorists argued that the European states and their offspring within the \"Family of Nations\" never had considered the aboriginal peoples capable of possessing rights on the international plane. The American jurist Charles Hyde, for example, explained that \"[a]t the time of European explorations in the Western Hemisphere in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ... States were agreed that the native inhabitants possessed no rights of territorial control which the European explorer or his monarch was bound to respect.\"114 Hyde accordingly concluded that \"[t]he American Indians have never been regarded as constituting persons or States of international law.\"115 By deeming indigenous peoples incapable of enjoying sovereign status or rights in international law, international law was thus able to govern the patterns of colonization and ultimately to legitimate the colonial order, with diminished or no consequences arising from the presence of aboriginal peoples. For international law purposes, indigenous lands prior to any colonial presence were considered legally unoccupied or terra nullius (vacant lands).116 Under this fiction, discovery was employed to uphold colonial claims to indigenous lands and to bypass any claim to possession by the natives in the \"discovered\" lands.117 In order to acquire indigenous lands, a colonizing state need not pretend conquest where war had not been waged, nor rely on the rules of war where it had.118 Instead, the positivist doctrines of effective occupation of territory and recognition of such occupation by the \"Family of Nations\" provided the legal mechanism for consolidating territorial sovereignty over indigenous lands by the colonizing states.119 An indigenous community's right to govern itself in its lands, as well as any right not to be conquered except in a \"just war,\" was simply considered outside the competency of international law. Likewise, treaties with American tribes and other indigenous peoples could simply be ignored for the purposes of international law.120 Westlake went so far as to hold that treaties with indigenous groups by which they ceded lands could not establish a state's title to territory because the \"uncivilised tribes\" did not comprehend the full attributes of territorial sovereignty.121 He thus justified a diminished status for indigenous treaties and rights in their lands while purporting to scrutinize the basis of colonial claims. Further, while acknowledging such diminished rights and suggesting the desirability of treaty relations with tribal groups to promote stability, Westlake characterized those rights, even if under treaty, as creating only moral obligations beyond the scope of international law.122 A somewhat dissenting strain of legal thought of the late nineteenth-early twentieth centuries was reflected in the work of the British publicist M. F. Lindley. Lindley continued the perception of a hierarchy of political and social organization in which the highest forms corresponded with European societies and their offspring.123 But he argued that non-European \"backward\" peoples with a certain minimum of organization did qualify as \"political societies,\" such that their territories could be acquired only by the rules ordinarily applicable to members of the \"International Family.\"124 For Lindley, unlike Westlake and others, the historical practice of treaty making between acknowledged members of the \"International Family\" and certain indigenous groups supported such a view. But while Lindley held that mere occupation could not confer legal title to the territory of indigenous peoples sufficiently organized as political societies, he maintained that their territories could be acquired by wars of\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n23\n\nconquest regardless of any underlying moral issue: \"[O]nce a Conquest has become a fait accompli, International Law recognizes its results.\"125 Whatever the merits of Lindley's analysis, by the early part of this century states had largely abandoned treaty making with tribal peoples and had mostly consolidated control over indigenous peoples' lands in the Americas and elsewhere with little or no outside scrutiny, aided by the imprimatur of legality supplied by the positivist frame. The dominance of the positivists' approach to indigenous peoples and their rights is reflected in international tribunal decisions of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1926 an international arbitration tribunal ruled that Great Britain could not maintain a claim for the \"Cayuga Nation\" as such, but only for the Cayuga Indians living in Canada on the basis of their British nationality. 126 In taking this position, the tribunal declared resolutely that an Indian \"tribe is not a legal unit of international law.\"127 The tribunal cited Hyde, among others, for the proposition that Indians never had been considered subjects of international law.128 And in the subsequent edition of his work, Hyde completed the bootstrap to support that position by citing the Cayuga Indians decision.129 A second relevant international arbitration in 1928 involved competing claims to the Island of Palmas between the United States and the Netherlands.130 The United States' claim was derived from Spain, which had based its title primarily on prior discovery. The tribunal ruled in favor of the Netherlands because of its effective occupation and display of authority on the island. The tribunal discussed various treaties the Dutch had entered into with native rulers but considered them only as \"facts\" relevant to the Netherlands' assertion of sovereignty.131 The tribunal stated that such \"contracts between a State. . . and native princes of chiefs of peoples not recognized as members of the community of nations ... are not, in the international law sense, treaties, or conventions capable of creating rights and obligations.\"132 A third case concerned a 1933 ruling on the legal status of Eastern Greenland by the Permanent Court of International Justice.133 Although acknowledging the indigenous Inuit (\"Eskimo\") population in Eastern Greenland, the court considered the territory's legal status as framed by the competing claims to sovereignty asserted by Norway and Denmark.134 Norway's assertion that parts of Greenland had been terra nullius at relevant times was trumped only by a finding that Denmark had effectively established sovereignty recognized by others within the exclusive community of states. Neither the Inuits' presence nor their efforts at driving away Nordic settlers had any bearing on the territory's status.135 This case, like thelsland of Palmas case, illustrates the operation of the positivists' international law, which affirmed sovereignty built upon colonialism to the exclusion of the sovereignty of indigenous peoples.\n\nTrusteeship Doctrine and Its \"Civilizing\" Mission As colonizing states and their offspring consolidated power over indigenous lands, many such states adopted trusteeship notions akin to those proposed earlier by Vitoria as grounds and parameters for the nonconsensual exercise of authority over indigenous peoples.136 Although it represented an element of humanistic thought toward\n\n24\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\nindigenous peoples, nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century trusteeship doctrine was rooted in the same Western philosophy that underlay the positivist construct of international law, which viewed non-European aboriginal peoples and their cultures as inferior. Pursuant to this philosophy, associated with the now infamous school identified as \"scientific racism,\" the objective of trusteeship was to wean native peoples from their \"backward\" ways and to \"civilize\" them.137 Among the colonial powers of the nineteenth century, Great Britain was a leader in devising special administrative regimes over native peoples with the objective of reengineering their cultural and social patterns in line with European conceptions of civilized behavior. In 1837, a special committee of the British House of Commons concluded that such a policy was required by the \"obligations of conscience to impart the blessings we enjoy,\"138 as well as by practical considerations: \"[W]e have abundant proof that it is greatly for our advantage to have dealings with civilized men rather than with barbarians. Savages are dangerous neighbors and unprofitable customers, and if they remain as degraded denizens of our colonies they become a burden upon the State.\"139 The British policy, and its premise of indigenous inferiority, is reflected in the following excerpt of a letter by prime minister Lord John Russell, written on August 23, 1840, to Sir George Gipps, the governor of New South Wales, Australia: Between the native, who is weakened by intoxicating liquors, and the European, who has all the strength of superior civilization and is free from its restraints, the unequal contest is generally of no long duration; the natives decline, diminish, and finally disappear. . .. The best chance of preserving the unfortunate race . . . lies in the means employed for training their children. The education given to such children should consist in a very small part of reading and writing. Oral instruction in the fundamental truths of the Christian religion will be given by the missionaries themselves. The children should be taught early; the boys to dig and plough, and the trades of shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, and masons; the girls to sew and cook and wash linen, and keep clean the rooms and furniture. 140\n\nThe United States, among other countries, followed the British lead in a firm embrace of trusteeship doctrine in its domestic law and policy. In the late nineteenth century, a vast government bureaucracy emerged under the U.S. commissioner of Indian affairs to consolidate and manage the system of reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and settlements that were home to the surviving Indian people within the country's external boundaries. In 1868, the Indian Commissioner wrote of his task: What, then, is our duty as the guardian of all the Indians under our jurisdiction? To outlaw, to pursue, to hunt down like wolves, and slay? Must we drive and exterminate them as if void of reason, and without souls: Surely, no. It is beyond question our most solemn duty to protect and care for, to elevate and civilize them. 141\n\nPursuant to its \"civilizing\" mission, the Indian Office assumed virtually despotic powers over Indian people through the early part of this century, even though judicial doctrine supported the view that the tribes continued to possess inherent sovereign powers. With most Indian people rendered dependent on government programs\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n25\n\nfor their subsistence, government officials effectively supplanted or eliminated autonomous structures of tribal governance. On the reservation, the government \"Indian agent was the new taskmaster bringing a multitude of new programs foreign to Indian ideas of the proper role of man in his society.\"142 Government programs designed to break Indian culture ran in collusion with those of Christian missionary institutions.143 Similarly, in Canada the Indian Act of 1876 consolidated and imposed a system of pervasive government control over Indian peoples and their lands.144 In Brazil, legislation established Indians as wards of the state and set in motion government programs to manage their affairs and facilitate their adoption of Euro-Brazilian ways.145 In Venezuela, the 1915 Mission Act delegated to the Catholic Church the task of \"civilizing\" the Indians and persuading them to live in established settlements.146 In this same vein, the 1853 Constitution of Argentina established in Congress the power to \"maintain peaceful relations with the Indians, and to promote their conversion to Catholicism.\"147 Trusteeship notions were internationalized through a series of conferences and related efforts aimed at regulating continued European penetration into Africa and the Pacific. Most notable in this respect was the first Berlin Conference on Africa, which concluded in 1885 with the signing of a general act intended to set the basic parameters for what has been dubbed the \"scramble for Africa.\"148 Under article VI of the General Act, the signatory powers agreed to \"bind themselves to watch over the preservation of the native tribes, and to care for the improvement of the conditions of their moral and material well-being,\" with the ultimate purpose of \"instructing the natives and bringing home to them the blessings of civilization.\"149 In 1888 the Institute of International Law, a consortium of international jurists dedicated to developing and clarifying international law, adopted a statement on the conditions required for a state to secure good title to occupied territory. Article VI of the statement identifies among these conditions the existence of a local authority that complies with \"the duty of watching over the conservation of the aboriginal populations, their education, and the amelioration of their moral and material condition.\"150 The international character of trusteeship was further enhanced and its scope broadened by the 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations adopted at the close of World War I. Under the Covenant, all League members committed to \"undertake to secure the just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control.\"151 In his 1926 work Lindley argued that the trusteeship doctrine as advanced by the Berlin General Act and the Covenant had become widely accepted and hence should be understood as part of general international law.152 Lindley held that, even if indigenous peoples were not themselves considered full subjects of international law, states could become obligated vis-a-vis each other as a matter of general international law for the benefit of native peoples over which they exercised control.153 Although somewhat grounded in international practice of the period, Lindley's proposition was in tension with state sovereignty principles that strongly tended to shield states from international scrutiny over matters deemed within their domestic realm. Yet even to the extent that they made their way into international law and established indigenous peoples as limited objects of international concern, conceptions of trusteeship—rooted in negative regard for indigenous cultural attributes—translated\n\n26\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\ninto more of a justification for colonial patterns than a force against them. Pursuant to the civilizing mission, government and Christian church agents proceeded through the early part of this century to break down indigenous forms of political and social organization, disrupt communal landholdings, and suppress cultural practices.154 Hence the civilizing mission—against the backdrop of the dominant positivist frame of international law that effectively diminished indigenous peoples' rights—ultimately facilitated the acquisitive forces that wrested control over indigenous peoples and their lands. Thus, whether through the doctrine of trusteeship or the positivist legal construction that denied sovereign status to indigenous peoples, international legal discourse and related decision processes developed historically to support the forces of colonization and empire that have trampled the capacity of indigenous peoples to determine their own course under conditions of equality. Early affirmations of indigenous peoples' rights succumbed to a state-centered Eurocentric system that could not accomodate indigenous peoples and their cultures as equals. However, just as international law once moved away from natural law thinking that was to some extent supportive of indigenous peoples' survival as distinct autonomous communities, international law is again shifting. But this time the shift is in retreat from the orientation that would divorce law from morality and deny international rights to all but states, or that would regard non-Westernized peoples as necessarily inferior. As the following chapter seeks to demonstrate, this latest shift, although fraught with tension, carries a reformed body of international law concerning indigenous peoples.\n\nNotes 1.

Apart from the encomienda system, slavery was an accepted practice where indigenous peoples were \"raided\" from not yet colonized territories and brought back to labor in Spanish settlements.

See Green & Dickason, supra note 3, at 163-73; Nussbaum, supra note 6, at 38-39. Medieval scholasticism, in which the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas looms large, synthesized an Aristotelian view of natural law as inherent in the innate rationalism of human nature with the divine law of Christian theology. Under the scholastic synthesis of these two traditions, natural law is viewed as the rational, albeit imperfect, human manifestation of God's eternal law. A more extensive discussion of the role of Aristotelian natural law in medieval scholasticism and the works of Thomas Aquinas is presented in Walter Ullmann, Principles of Government and Politics in the Middle Ages 231-79 (1961). 10.

Vincent describes political society in the Middle Ages as \"criss-crossed with overlapping groups and conflicting loyalties and bodies of rules.\" Vincent, supra note 15, at 15. The feudal system, the dominant political order of medieval Europe, tended to have a fragmenting effect on political organization. It was essentially a complex and rather loose structure of contractual or mutual obligations existing throughout a complex social hierarchy. . . . The monarch was in no special sovereign position; he was part of and reliant upon the community of the realm and was consequently under the law, not the source of it. ... Many of the more significant groups—the large estates, the clergy, guilds and nobility—generated their own systems of rules and courts. Id. at 14.

The text of this papal donation, known as bull Inter caetera (1493), is in European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies to 1648, at 61-63 (Francis G. Davenport ed., 1967). 20. See Hanke, supra note 3, at 25-27; Green & Dickason, supra note 3, at 4-6. The papal bull Inter caetera was relied upon in the Requerimiento, a decree issued by Spain's King Ferdinand in 1512. The Requerimiento expressly invoked the papal donation as it ordered the \"idolatrous Indians\" to acknowledge \"the Church as the Ruler and Superior of the whole world and the high priest called the Pope, and in his name the King and Queen Juana in his stead as superiors, lords, and kings of these islands and in this Tierra Firme by virtue of said donation.\" The decree was intended to be read to Indians encountered by Spanish conquistadors, and it imposed severe penalties on indigenous peoples who did not immediately acknowledge its precepts: \"[W]e shall take you and your wives and children and shall make slaves of them . . . and we shall take away your goods, and shall do all the harm and damage that we can, as to vassals who do not obey.\" See Hanke, supra note 3, 31-36 (quoting and discussing the Requerimiento). As Hanke observes, the Requerimiento was \"read to trees and empty huts when no Indians were to be found. Captains muttered its theological phrases into their beards on the edge of sleeping Indian settlements, or even a league away before starting the formal attack, and at times some leather-lunged Spanish notary hurled its sonorous phrases after the Indians as they fled into the mountains.\" Id. at 34. 21.

Compare Felix S. Cohen, \"The Spanish Origin of Indian Rights in the Law of the United States,\" 31 Geo. L.J. 1 (1942). While Cohen presents a pioneering discussion of Vitoria's work as an affirmation of Indian rights, he did not mention or come to grips with the parts of Vitoria's lectures that discussed the duties of the Indians and the Spanish recourse to war against them under certain circumstances. 28. The Latin term jus gentium as used by classical-era scholars often has been translated in modern times as the \"law of nations,\" as it was in the 1917 translation of Vitoria's sixteenth-century work. As Nussbaum points out, however, it was not until \"the seventeenth century that jus gentium began to assume the significance of a technical term for the law among independent states.\" Nussbaum, supra note 6, at 13-15. The body of Roman law to which the term originally applied was concerned with the rights and duties of people throughout the Roman Empire. Id. 29. De indis, supra note 17, at 151. 30. Id. at 153. 31. Published in De indis, supra note 17. 32. Id. at 156. 33. Professor Robert Williams Jr. has taken an especially critical view of the Renaissance European theory of just war, particularly as articulated by Vitoria on the basis of the Roman jus gentium and biblical passages, calling it a highly \"Eurocentrically and Christianocentrically understood consensus of the whole world in harmony with the West's vision of reason and truth.\" Robert A. Williams Jr., The American Indian in Western Legal Thought: The Discourses of Conquest 107 (1990). See also Robert A.

See generally Green & Dickason, supra note 3, at 48-54, 198 (discussing Gentili, Suarez, and Ayala); Nussbaum, supra note 6, at 84-101 (discussing Suarez, Ayala, and Gentilis). Lewis Hanke points out that Bartolome de las Casas had a uniquely limited view among sixteenth-century Spanish theorists of the grounds that might justify the use of force and conquest. In his highly sympathetic portrayal of the Dominican missionary, Hanke stresses that de las Casas denied that the objective of converting American Indians to Christianity could alone justify war against them. Hanke, supra note 3, at 72-77. See also Green & Dickason, supra note 3, at 202. Hanke concedes, nonetheless, that de las Casas, in addition to wholeheartedly embracing the Christian evangelizing mission, joined in the premise that war against the Indians might be permissible under certain conditions. Hanke, supra note 3, at 178. 35. Grotius, The Law of War and Peace, supra note 12, at 550. In his 1608 work, The Freedom of the Seas, Grotius, citing Vitoria, affirmed the universality of rights and obligations on the grounds that God was the founder and ruler of the universe, and especially that being the Father of all mankind, He had not separated human beings, as He had the rest of living things, into different species and various divisions, but had willed them to be of one race and to be known by one name; that furthermore He had given them the same origin, the same structural organism, the ability to look each other in the face, language too, and other means of communication, in order that they all might recognize their natural social bond and kinship. Grotius, Freedom of the Seas, supra note 8, at 1-2. 36. Grotius, The Law of War and Peace, supra note 12, at 397. 37. Id. at 169-85. 38. Although he argued that the punishment of those who behave impiously or who engage in religious persecution is justified, Grotius asserted that \"wars cannot justly be waged against those who are unwilling to accept the Christian religion.\" Id. at 516. Grotius, following in the tradition of Bartolome de las Casas, see supra note 34, presented two arguments in support of his claim that war should not be waged against those who \"refused to embrace the Christian religion when proffered to them.\" First, he asserts that because Christianity is insusceptible to \"purely natural arguments,\" nonbelievers have reason initially to resist the faith. Second, he relies on Christian scriptures that dictate that conversion should not be compelled by fear or threat of punishment. Grotius, The Law of War and Peace, supra note 12, at 516-17. 39. Id. at 171. 40. Felix Cohen makes the case that Spanish law in the late sixteenth century and afterward ultimately provided a humane basis for the treatment of indigenous peoples, notwithstanding the conspicuous failure of Spanish settlers to observe it. Cohen, supra note 27, at 12-13. He cites the Spanish Laws of the Indies, which commanded that the granting of lands to Spanish settlers could not prejudice or injure the Indians. Cohen characterizes the Laws of the Indies as holding Indians in a legally equal position to that of Spanish settlers. Id. Likewise, Hanke notes that in 1542 Emperor Charles V of Spain abolished the slaverylike encomienda system and instituted the \"New Laws.\" Hanke, supra note 3, at 83, 91-92. Hanke characterized the New Laws and the regulations that accompanied them as \"so sweeping and so strongly in favor of the Indians that Las Casas himself might well have drafted them.\" Id. at 91. The enactment of the New Laws was met with outrage by Spanish colonists in the Americas, who were obliged in certain circumstances to relinquish Indian laborers held on encomiendas. Id. But the Spanish officials sent to enforce the New Laws in Mexico sus-\n\n30\n\nDevelopments over Time\n\npended many of the more far-reaching provisions in response to the widespread protests. In Peru, the viceroy sent to enforce the New Laws was decapitated in an ensuing revolt. In 1545, caving in to a vigorous campaign waged against the New Laws in the Spanish court, Charles V revoked a significant provision of the New Laws, preserving the encomienda system. Id. at 95-105.

Hobbes characterized the state of nature—life outside of civil society—as a state of war, in which life is \"solitary, pooor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan 89 (Richard Tuck ed., 1991) (1651). For Hobbes, the commonwealth forms when people confer all their power and strength upon one Man, or upon one Assembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills, by plurality of voices, unto one Will; which is as much as to say, to appoint one Man, or Assembly of men, to beare their Person.. . . This is more than Consent, or Concord; it is a reall Unitie of them all, in one and the same Person, made by Covenant of every man with every man. . . . This done, the Multitude so united in one Person, is called a \"COMMON-WEALTH\", in latine CIVITAS. Id. at 120. The \"state of nature\" and \"natural law\" were not used interchangeably, but were discrete terms for Hobbes. Hobbes defined \"natural law\" as a dictate of right reason, with \"reason\" referring not to inherently true principles, but to a method of deductive thinking. See Norberto Bobbio, Thomas Hobbes and the Natural Law Tradition 118-19 (Daniela Gobetti trans., 1993).\n\nThe Historical Context\n\n31\n\n46.

Id. Preface at 5a. Vattel elaborated: [T]he Law of Nations is in its origin merely the Law of Nature applied to Nations. Now the just and reasonable application of a rule requires that the application be made in a manner suited to the nature of the subject; but we must not conclude that the Law of Nations is everywhere and at all points the same as natural law, except for a difference of subjects, so that no other change need be made than to substitute Nations for individuals. A civil society, or a State, is a very different subject from an individual person, and therefore, by virtue of the natural law, very different obligations and rights belong to it in most cases. The same general rule, when applied to two different subjects, cannot result in similar principles, nor can a particular rule, however just for one subject, be applicable to a second of a totally different nature. Hence there are many cases in which the natural law does not regulate the relations of States as it would those of individuals. We must know how to apply it conformably to its subjects; and the art of so applying it, with a precision founded upon right reason, constitutes the Law of Nations as a distinct science. Id. at 4. 52. Id. at 8-9; see Damerow, supra note 6, at 33—48 (explaining the categories of law identified by Vattel as comprising the law of nations). 53. Vattel, supra note 49, at 13. 54. See David Beetham, \"The Future of the Nation State,\" in The Idea of the Modern State, supra note 15, at 208—09 (discussing European nationhood in terms of \"characteristics of culture and historical identity\"). 55. See Shennan, supra note 43, at 3 (describing the post-Westphalian state as \"organized around an impersonal, centralized and unifying system of government resting on law, bureaucracy and force\"); Vincent, supra note 15, at 19 (\"Primarily a State exists in a geographically identifiable territory over which it holds jurisdiction.\"). 56. David Beetham observes that \"[t]he nation-state, then, is a historical product, not a fact of nature. It embodies two distinct ideas of sovereignty: sovereignty as the idea of the state's supreme and independent jurisdiction over a given territory; and sovereignty as the idea that the source of legitimacy for that jurisdiction derives from the people who constitute the nation.\" Beetham, supra note 54, at 209. 57.

Vattel held that [e]very Nation is ... bound by the natural law to cultivate the land which has fallen to its share.. .. Those who still pursue this idle mode of life ... [of seeking] to live upon their flocks and the fruits of the chase . .. occupy more land than they would have need of under an honest system of labor, and they may not complain if other more industrious Nations, too confined at home, should come and occupy part of their lands. Id. at 37-38. This view, anticipating the modern law and economics movement, reflects the highly influential theory of property rights earlier advanced by John Locke. Locke identified property as the individual appropriation of generally available resources: \"'[T]is the taking any part of what is common, and removing it out of the state Nature left it in, which begins Property.\" Thus ownership is established through labor: \"God .. . commanded Man to Labour ... to subdue the Earth, i.e. improve it for the benefit of life, and therein lay something out upon it that was his own, his labour.\" The natural world is envisioned as \"lying waste,\" awaiting the labor of man to transform it into valuable and productive property.
