This collection of essays by leading legal scholars and lawyers from Europe and the Americas addresses the implications of globalization for the legal regulation of the new workplace. It examines the role of international labour standards and the contribution of the International Labour Organization, and assesses the success of the European experiment with continental employment standards. It explores the prospects for hemispheric cooperation on labour standards in the Americas, and deals with the impact of international labour standards on the rights of women and migrant workers. As the nature and organization of work around the world is being decisively transformed, new regional and international institutions are emerging that may provide the platform for new labour standards, and for protecting existing ones. john d. r. craig is a Partner at Heenan Blaikie LLP, Toronto, and is Adjunct Professor at the University of Western Ontario Faculty of Law, London, Ontario. s. michael lynk is Associate Professor of Law at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nGLOBALIZATION AND THE FUTURE OF LAB OUR LAW Edited by JOHN D.

Very few of us realise with conviction the intensely unusual, unstable, complicated, unreliable, temporary nature of the economic organisation by which Western Europe has lived for the last half century. We assume some of the most peculiar and temporary of our late advantages as natural, permanent, and to be depended on, and we lay our plans accordingly. On this sandy and false foundation we scheme our social improvement and dress our political platforms, pursue our animosities and particular ambitions . . . John Maynard Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919)1 Having lost the comfort of our geographic boundaries, we must in effect rediscover what creates the bond between humans that constitute a community. Jean-Marie Guehenno, The End of the Nation-State 2\n\nLabour law and globalization The defining characteristic of globalization in our modern age has been to challenge the stability and isolation of what is local, without always conferring the benefit of what is universal. Economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty over the past fifteen years, yet the prosperity has been unevenly distributed, and economic inequalities and social exclusion within and among nations have actually deepened. Open societies have emerged, but the erection of democratic national and global institutions to manage the volatility of social and economic change has proven largely elusive. New means of communications are enabling the arrival of a truly global conscience, but they have also spread a homogeneous culture that is eroding local identities and distinctiveness. More people are working but, more than ever before, they labour in conditions of employment 1\n\n2\n\njohn craig and michael lynk\n\ninformality and insecurity. The workplaces of our new world are being transformed by the dynamic push of international trade patterns, capital investment flows, and migratory labour movements, but the regulation of these workplaces, when they are regulated at all, remains the province of national labour and employment laws that are increasingly unable to either protect or adapt. Compared to the whirl of change in the international economy, domestic labour laws have largely stood still over the past fifteen years. In part, this has been the result of new fiscal and economic policies pursued by governments and international institutions that have opened up labour markets and, in the process, weakened the ability of trade unions and liberal forces in society to seek enhanced employment conditions and improved legislation. Another contributing factor has been the declining role of national governments, where the self-induced policies of lower taxation rates, a reduced state presence in the economy, and more restrictive social programmes have curtailed their desire and their capacity to regulate labour market outcomes. A third factor has seemingly been an exhaustion of ideas, as if the statutory models of labour law regulation that have prevailed over the past half century and more have been depleted of their possibilities to be reformed and regenerated. Moreover, this legislative stagnation shows no sign of any early abatement, as the politics of national labour law reform have become increasingly contingent upon the deference of governments to the real and imagined imperatives of the international market-place. Let us be clear. National labour laws will remain, far into the future, the primary legal structure for promoting fair employment practices, for enabling workers to achieve collective representation, for regulating the reconcilable differences between employers and employees, and for diminishing the patterns of discrimination and exclusion at work. But, increasingly, these laws are unable to accomplish their public purpose. The declining numerical strength of trade unions, the shrinking public resources devoted to the enforcement of legislative standards, and the rise of contingent and unregulated work relationships all point to a widening gap between labour law norms and workplace realities. Meanwhile, the rising percentage of trade as a component of national economies, the spreading out by companies of their production stages across countries and continents, and the instant transfer of work around the globe by modern technology have meant that globalization is reshaping our workplaces much more decisively than our available legal tools can meaningfully regulate them. Thus, the question becomes: if some of the causes for the malaise\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nin labour law performance lie in the dynamic shifts in the global economy, can some of the solutions also be found in the international sphere? The driving engine of globalization has been economic, and the struggle at the international level to promote non-mercantile values such as environmental protection, human rights, and social and labour standards, while not forgotten, has often been a distant concern. The law, in particular, has reflected this lopsided emphasis. A fierce commitment has been given within the international sphere to the legal status and enforcement of trade agreements, private capital investments and intellectual property guarantees, complete with elaborate dispute resolution mechanisms that are rules-based, respected and obeyed. Indeed, this nascent system of international economic rights has been regularly identified as a template for a grander law-based approach to manage other sorts of global issues. However, the blueprints for a brave new world of international social and workplace rights have not advanced much beyond drafting tables and noble dreams. To date, the success of international labour law in protecting and promoting employment rights has been confined largely to the issuance of aspirational declarations, advisory standards and tribunal recommendations. Yet, something profound is stirring. The intense unease that has greeted the promises and the institutions of globalization has spawned a new intellectual climate of criticism and analysis. Among industrial relations and legal academics concerned with employment and labour rights, a recognition is growing that the grand project of regulating the workplace to promote industrial justice is passing through a period of propulsive change, comparable perhaps only to the transition from the common law and traditional contractual principles to statutory labour laws during the years immediately before and after the Second World War. As responses to the challenges of globalization and the limitations of national law, two distinct and complementary approaches are emerging. Domestically, the argument is being made more and more insistently that labour rights, until now expressed primarily through ordinary employment statutes, must acquire a constitutional status as fundamental legal rights if they are to avoid a slide into disrepair. Internationally, the promising achievements of the European experience with supranational agreements as a means to promote labour laws, and the altogether more modest attempts in the Americas to include voluntary labour standards as an adjunct to regional trade agreements, have stirred the intellectual and social imagination about the possibility of new international and continental structures to secure workplace rights.\n\n4\n\njohn craig and michael lynk\n\nInternational labour law has existed as a discrete body of norms and advisory rules since the early years of the International Labour Organization following the First World War. For many years thereafter, there existed in the minds of most labour law scholars a traditional and simple division between the substantive rules of national labour laws and the advisory standards and conventions proclaimed by the ILO. One warranted a respected review, because it was solid, and the other received only a fleeting mention, because it was lighter than air. But over the past twenty years or so, this division no longer accurately represents the growing complexity of modern labour law on the international stage. Building on the promise of the European experiment, and the tentative steps taken elsewhere, it is becoming clear that the creation of new international labour law structures will not occur as a top-down project. Almost certainly, these new structures will evolve out of the growing number of regional and hemispheric economic agreements, which have added labour standards pacts as a political response to the demands for social protection against the shocks of rapid change. While, initially, many of these labour pacts have been humble efforts, they contain within them the potential of becoming the platforms for more substantive institutions and more effective rules that can complement and supplement the body of national labour laws. Yet, for any of this to occur, much depends upon the political will to recognize how globalization’s imbalance between economy and society is exasperating social fault lines across the world. Euclid, when asked by Ptolemy if there was a shorter route to mastering his teachings than by reading the Elements, is said to have replied: “There is no ‘royal road’ to geometry.” So it is with the problems of globalization and the modern regulation of work. While the trials now confronting labour law are similar in importance to earlier periods of great transformations in the organization of employment, the challenges of our present era are almost certainly unique in dimension and complexity. The issues of national sovereignty, regional cooperation, the myriad of different systems of labour law regulation, the variety and number of workers falling outside formal protection, and the sheer pace of economic change present problems of an entirely new magnitude. But the very scale of the challenges of globalization to the world of work makes a multilateral response both indispensable and inescapable. As the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization in its landmark report in 2004 pointed out, these problems are solvable and they are manageable, but not without a resolute universal recognition that human dignity, international solidarity and industrial justice are the cornerstone ethical values that\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\ncan alone provide legitimacy to the globalization project as it affects the workplace.3 This volume of essays on globalization and the future of labour law seek to understand some of the problems and possibilities in our new world of work. The authors of these essays share the common starting point that the fundamental premises of contemporary labour law – workplace justice, industrial citizenship and production flexibility – remain intact, but that the ability to realize these goals through conventional regulatory tools are being substantially challenged by the new economic and political realities of the international marketplace. The authors’ perspectives traverse through a range of issues, both geographic and topical, and are based on their experiences both in their home countries and regions and on the international stage. Drafts of many of the papers were first presented at a conference held at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario on 17 and 18 October 2003. This conference, co-sponsored by the Faculty of Law at the University of Western Ontario, the Canadian national law firm Heenan Blaikie LLP, and the Toronto law firm of Koskie Minsky, was among the first to be held in North America exclusively devoted to the issue of globalization and international labour law.\n\nPart I\n\nPerspectives on globalization\n\nBrian Burkett’s introductory paper (Chapter 1) introduces the concept of the “international labour dimension”, and sets the stage for each of the papers that follow. In Burkett’s view, regional and international labour integration involves the interplay not only of legal norms and standards with regulatory effect, but also of processes and institutions to develop and administer norms and standards at the international level. Burkett suggests that initiatives within the international labour dimension have a long and complex history that predates the founding of the ILO in 1919, and can even be traced back to the early nineteenth century. With the ILO came the birth of modern international labour law, which was premised on three pillars: social, political, and economic. The social relates to the shared desire to improve the human condition; the political refers to meeting ideological challenges (in 1919, the ideological challenges of communism and socialism); and the economic addresses social dumping and the ‘race to the bottom’. Burkett is able to identify these three pillars within regional initiatives such as the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mercosur, and the Summit of the Americas Process.\n\n6\n\njohn craig and michael lynk\n\nIn Chapter 2, Harry Arthurs asks the question, “Who’s afraid of globalization?” He posed this question when delivering the inaugural Koskie Minsky University Lecture on Labour Law that opened the conference on 17 October 2003. In answering the question, Arthurs focuses first on assessing the actual impact of globalization on substantive domestic labour laws. His conclusion: labour law continues to be viewed as primarily local in nature. This leads him to adopt a “common sense hypothesis” that globalization is formative, as opposed to normative. In other words, globalization changes labour law not by directly amending the substantive rules but instead by transforming the institutions and processes through which those rules are made and administered. Arthurs offers a message of optimism in the face of globalization. He observes that social progress is most enduring when it is built from the bottom-up. While globalization may make grassroots reform a daunting prospect, it is nevertheless possible, particularly if the advantages of globalization – e.g. instantaneous communications and the ability to organize over great distances – can be harnessed.\n\nPart II\n\nInternational labour standards\n\nPart II focuses on the appropriate role of international labour standards in meeting the challenges of globalization. Each author offers a unique perspective. In Chapter 3, Kevin Banks addresses the phenomenon of social dumping and the link that has been drawn between international trade and labour standards. Banks writes that emerging scholarship has brought into question the theory that trade liberalization without labour standards will inevitably lead to a “race to the bottom”. In fact, the evidence suggests that nations that improve their labour standards will generate positive long-term economic benefits. Social dumping is, at best, a short-term economic strategy. The implication is that international labour standards can be justified because of their positive long-term economic impact and not simply because they constitute international barriers to social dumping. However, as Banks observes, the enforcement of international labour standards remains a thorny issue. V´eronique Marleau suggests a different approach to globalization in Chapter 4. In her view, the optimal means of managing labour law in an era of globalization is through the concept of subsidiarity: decisions affecting individuals should, as far as possible, be made by the level of government closest to them. As a principle of social organization, subsidiarity localizes decision-making to the greatest extent possible, thereby creating a link between social and economic phenomena occurring at the global level and\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nthe circumstances and priorities of affected individuals and communities. Marleau is able to point to concrete examples of subsidiarity within the European Union and the ILO to bolster her point. In Chapter 5, Alan Hyde offers a colourful and instructive defence of transnational labour standards, relying for support on Game Theory. In Hyde’s “stag hunt”, participants are only able to achieve the optimal result (i.e. successfully hunting a stag) if they cooperate and act collectively. If one participant chooses the course of individual action (i.e. prefers to hunt a hare individually instead of a stag collectively) then all other participants will either be left empty-handed (since hunting a stag is no longer possible) or will be forced to engage in the individual hunt for hares. Through the stag hunt model, Hyde is able to draw certain conclusions about transnational labour standards. Foremost among these is that multilateral cooperation in raising labour standards is crucial. However, the fewer the participants, the more likely they will be to develop the level of trust and cooperation that is necessary to ensure compliance with transnational labour standards. As such, Hyde suggests that greater success may be achieved through transnational labour standards negotiated in bilateral or regional trading agreements.\n\nPart III\n\nThe European Union\n\nThe European Union has the most advanced system of regional labour integration, yet it is experiencing new challenges arising from the addition in 2004 of ten new states: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The future of European labour law is thus the focus of Part III of this book. In Chapter 6, Manfred Weiss provides an overview of the industrial relations systems in the new member states from Central and Eastern Europe. He observes that these systems have developed over the past decade in reaction to the legacy of communism, and tend to reflect excessive neo-liberalism. As such, collective organizations representing workers and employers are relatively rare in the private sector, tripartite social dialogue is largely absent, and collective bargaining is the exception rather than the rule (and generally only occurs on a plant or company basis). Weiss further observes that while the Central and Eastern European states generally have favourable labour laws, implementation and enforcement are inadequate. Private sector companies are presently able to contract out of labour laws, in any event. Given the fundamental importance of collective organizations and social dialogue in EU-level labour law, Weiss\n\n8\n\njohn craig and michael lynk\n\nidentifies significant structural flaws that could threaten to undermine and delay future initiatives. Arturo Bronstein’s paper in Chapter 7 complements Weiss’s paper. Bronstein outlines the evolution of labour laws in the Central and Eastern European states since the fall of communism. He describes their legal systems at the end of the communist era, emphasizing their diverse circumstances and laws. He then plots the approaches taken by these states to modernize their labour laws in the 1990s with a view to EU membership. Like Weiss, Bronstein points to excessive neo-liberalism and deregulation as predominant forces. Interestingly, however, he notes that most of the Central and Eastern European states have ultimately chosen to pursue a labour law model based on the German precedent; they have also sought technical assistance from German and French experts, and the ILO. Moreover, the ILO’s standards and principles on freedom of association and collective bargaining have generally been adopted as the institutional framework for newly developing industrial relations systems. Given these developments, Bronstein predicts that the values of the European Social Model will eventually be embedded within the labour law systems of the Central and Eastern European states. The final paper in Part III, by Catherine Barnard (Chapter 8), explores the development of worker mobility rights within the European Union, and considers whether the European experience holds any lessons for international labour law. Barnard is particularly interested in the implications of the principle of “solidarity”, which has emerged within recent European jurisprudence. Solidarity is used to describe the relational bonds of citizens and communities, who share common interests, mutual dependence, and unity of purpose. While solidarity is generally found within states, it is not necessarily present at the transnational level. Indeed, the question arises whether the emergence of transnational solidarity is a precondition to true social and labour integration of the kind pursued by the EU. Barnard’s discussion on this point could well be read in conjunction with Hyde’s “stag hunt” analogy (Chapter 5). Are states more likely to cooperate in the pursuit of common social goals where solidarity prevails among their citizens? Is solidarity an essential precondition to multilateral action in social fields like labour law?\n\nPart IV\n\nThe Americas\n\nWhereas the European Union has decades of experience in harmonizing economic and social policies, the nations of the Americas are only\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nnow embarking upon a process to create a common hemispheric market through the proposed FTAA. It remains an open question how labour and other social issues will be treated under the FTAA. Hence, the papers in Part IV consider the challenges and potential outcomes of the FTAA negotiations. In Chapter 9, Lance Compa adopts a pragmatic approach to worker rights under the FTAA, emphasizing the need to develop a viable, as opposed to a definitive or triumphant, solution for addressing worker concerns in a hemispheric economic zone. To this end, Compa considers in detail the hemispheric systems that already exist – the NAALC regime within NAFTA, Mercosur’s Social-Labour Declaration, and Caricom’s Charter of Civil Society. He concludes that governments of the Americas do not need to invent a new approach to address workers’ rights within the FTAA. Instead, a system can be developed that incorporates features from each of the existing systems. Brian Langille (Chapter 10) provides a principled justification for the adoption of labour rights within the FTAA. In his view, what is needed is a dramatic shift in attitude towards the social dimensions of trade liberalization. Langille argues that the negotiation of transnational social protections and standards is defensible not simply to prevent the “race to the bottom”. More importantly, such measures are essential for socioeconomic development and human progress. In developing a labour rights component to the FTAA, Langille states that countries participating in the FTAA talks need to reevaluate their reasons for engaging a labour rights agenda. If countries’ mutual objectives include long-term economic development, social progress and political stability, then these objectives can and should inform the outcome of the FTAA negotiations. Jos´e Pastore’s paper (Chapter 11) provides a detailed examination of Latin American industrial relations systems, to demonstrate the challenges facing FTAA negotiators in creating viable hemispheric labour standards. Pastore focuses on the nations of Mercosur – Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay – and observes that they each have comprehensive protective labour laws, yet compliance with these laws is problematic. Moreover, informal employment relationships predominate, leaving millions of workers beyond the reach of protective laws. Pastore also points to significant vested interests in Latin American societies that have frustrated previous reform initiatives, both domestically and within Mercosur. With respect to the FTAA, Pastore takes the view that the priority should be to develop hemispheric mechanisms to enhance local compliance with domestic labour laws, as opposed to implementing and enforcing\n\n10\n\njohn craig and michael lynk\n\nhemispheric labour standards. Hence, a model based on the NAALC system would be preferable.\n\nPart V\n\nThe ILO\n\nThe ILO’s significance in the debate over labour law and globalization cannot be overstated. Particularly since 1998, when it identified the “core” labour rights and promulgated its Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the ILO has taken centre stage in all discussions related to global economic and social integration. The two papers in Part V consider the ILO’s history and its future role in the globalization debate. Werner Sengenberger’s paper (Chapter 12) discusses the pluralist vision of the economy and society that has underscored the ILO’s approach. Since 1919, the ILO has advocated processes for reconciling competing interests that emphasize association, consultation, negotiation and social dialogue. As Sengenberger notes, the ILO’s pluralist approach to establishing international labour standards has often been challenged by economic orthodoxy, which itself advocates an unfettered free market as the optimal means of achieving greater employment opportunities and stronger worker protection. The pluralist approach has also occasionally been challenged on political and cultural grounds; however, Sengenberger argues that political and cultural objections to international labour standards are often mere pretexts designed to preserve the positions of powerful vested interests. Ultimately, Sengenberger suggests that the greatest challenge to the ILO in the coming years will arise out of the global economic and political environment. Will parochial attitudes and opportunistic local behaviour predominate, or will international cooperation prevail? In Chapter 13, Edward Potter provides an overview of the United States’ approach to the ILO. As the world’s only superpower, the United States is a crucial player in the international sphere. Potter explains that the United States has had an uneasy relationship with the ILO since joining in 1934. Prior to 1989, the United States participated in the ILO primarily to fight communism and to limit the scope of international labour standards. Since 1990, however, there has been a remarkable transformation of the United States’ attitude toward the ILO. Potter argues that the United States now views the ILO as an important actor in addressing worker rights in the global economy. This is particularly the case since the United States’ policy is to link worker rights with trade. Potter argues that the United\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nStates’ emphasis on worker rights within international trading agreements has significantly enhanced the legitimacy of the ILO as an international standard-setting body.\n\nPart VI\n\nLabour rights\n\nOne of the areas where the attributes of globalization will be most carefully judged will be its impact upon historically vulnerable workers. Women and migrant workers have often lacked adequate protections under national labour laws, and they have become a special target of concern in the debates on the international role of law in regulating the global workplace. Mary Cornish, Fay Faraday and Veena Verma consider the issue of gender inequality in Chapter 14. They emphasize the unique issues facing women in the new global economy: women’s jobs are often precarious, substandard and low wage; the majority of positions in the growing informal economy are held by women; women continue to bear the burden of family and community responsibilities; and women can be easily exploited by low wage employers because of their need for flexible employment. Cornish, Faraday and Verma emphasize that gender inequality is pervasive and structural in nature. Achieving gender equality will require concerted efforts on the part of international bodies, states, employers and unions. In the final Chapter, Ryszard Cholewinski examines the application of international labour standards developed first by the ILO and then under the auspices of the United Nations towards the plight of migrant workers. After considering some of the specific concerns of the modern migrant labour force, including those of women and temporary workers, Cholewinski argues that the working conditions of migrant employees in the receiving countries are becoming acute because they are “. . . often seen as a tool in maintaining competitiveness at the expense of formal employment and human rights protections”. While the ILO has developed a comprehensive set of labour standards for the protection of migrant workers, much needs to be done to ensure these standards are realized at the national level. Paradoxically, he concludes, the process of globalization that has exasperated the traditionally difficult working conditions of migrant workers has also brought together the diverse and geographically distant movements in support of migrant workers’ rights that are becoming increasingly effective in their struggle for a fair and just deal.\n\n12\n\njohn craig and michael lynk\n\nConclusion Labour law is but one of several important public tools and private forces that will shape the future of the global workplace. Economic agreements, trade and investment patterns, technological developments, political institutions, social and civil conventions and non-governmental organizations have all contributed to the dynamic changes in the organization of work, and to the emerging debate about how the employment relationship should now be regulated and protected in the face of new global realities. Our early warning systems – in the form of international institutional reports, scholarly writings, critical journalism and, indeed, the experiences of everyday life – are telling us that globalization in its present form is probably unsustainable, and the new workplace is becoming one of the social canaries that are signalling the coming distress. But this is not a message of despair. While globalization may be inevitable and everywhere, its final course is not predetermined. The role of labour law, both in its present form and in its imagined vision, is part of the larger debate over the ethical and social dimensions of globalization. Where all this will take us is not yet clear, but the newly forged human bonds of community and shared values are illuminating the way forward. Notes 1. (Penguin Press, London, 1995). 2.

An understanding of this history is essential to any serious consideration of how the international labour dimension might develop in the coming years. Hence, the first objective of this paper is to survey the historical development of the international labour dimension, and to highlight its underlying social, political and economic dynamics. To this end, the focus of this discussion will be on the International Labour Organization (ILO), and three regional systems: the European Union (EU), NAFTA, and Mercosur. The Summit of the Americas Process and the negotiations surrounding the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) will also be considered. The choice of the term “international labour dimension” suggests a second objective. Although lawyers – both practitioners and scholars – tend to refer to international labour “law”, it is quite clear that legal norms are only one element of the diverse efforts to address working conditions and labour standards at a level above the nation-state. The latter part of this paper will consider the broader concept of the international labour dimension, focusing on the diversity of approaches to promulgating norms and standards, and to addressing issues of administration and enforcement. The analysis will show that the international labour dimension should be understood as a complex interplay of norms and standards, institutions, and processes, all with the broad purpose of facilitating regional and international labour integration and cooperation. 15\n\n16\n\nbrian burkett\n\nDevelopments in the international labour dimension – a survey The beginnings The ILO was founded in 1919. However, this event was hardly the “genesis” of the international labour dimension. Although it is difficult to pinpoint an exact date, it is safe to say that discussions at the international level about working conditions and labour reform predated the ILO by over a century. The year 1818 is particularly notable, being the year of the Conference of the European Powers at Aix-la-Chapelle, France. There, British industrialist Robert Owen forcefully argued that a cooperative international effort to reform the conditions of labour would be in the interests of all classes of society. Having considered the vagaries of the industrial revolution, Owen advanced the theory that shorter hours of work and improved living conditions for workers would help to remove the causes that perpetuated human misery.1 Owen even proposed an international institution to facilitate reform efforts. There were a surprising number of international conferences on the subject of labour during the second half of the nineteenth century. These were generally privately organized affairs, with conference participants made up of academics, doctors, lawyers, social workers, and legislators.2 The first of these was an international conference organized by Edouard Ducpetiaux, a Belgian prison inspector-general, in 1856 in Brussels. At a follow-up conference in 1857 in Frankfurt, a motion was adopted that called for the creation of international conventions regarding working conditions.3 Increasing discussion and concern at the international level about working conditions was paralleled by the rise of an international labour movement, through which workers formed transnational associations and demanded the emancipation of labour in all nations.4 In 1866, at the first conference of the International Workers’ Association in Geneva, several proposals were submitted on the reduction of the length of working days and the protection of women and children. Such demands were soon incorporated into the political agenda of socialists, who both responded to, and further fuelled, the demands of international labour. The formation of socialist parties emphasizing worker empowerment accelerated in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with such parties eventually establishing a presence in countries across Europe.5 Despite the efforts of the international labour movement, and pressure applied by domestic socialist parties, it was not until the late 1800s\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n17\n\nthat state governments were persuaded to pursue international cooperation. At the invitation of the Swiss government, several European states attended a preparatory conference in Bern on 5 May 1890. The subject was the negotiation of an international agreement on the improvement of working conditions. Germany proposed establishing a group of independent persons who would supervise the implementation of multilateral protective measures. The conference endorsed this proposal, which stimulated the adoption of national labour legislation in several countries, including Germany, Austria, Denmark and Portugal.6 The International Association for the Legal Protection of Workers (the “International Association”), founded in 1897, held its first constitutive assembly four years later in Basel. Seven countries participated. In order to achieve some consensus among the participants, a commission was formed to prepare general prohibitions on the less controversial subjects of night work for women and the use of white phosphorous in the match industry. Two conventions on these subjects were prepared and adopted at a diplomatic conference in Bern in 1906.7 These became the first true international labour conventions when they were ratified and came into force in 1912.8 Inspired by the work of the International Association, France and Italy negotiated a groundbreaking bilateral labour treaty in 1904, which dealt with accident indemnity, unemployment insurance, age restrictions, and welfare conditions for nationals of one country who were working in the other country.9 By 1915, over twenty bilateral labour treaties had been signed in addition to the two 1906 conventions, involving twelve European countries and the United States. These treaties covered subjects ranging from social insurance to the migration of workers.10 After the Bern conference, the International Association continued its work on labour questions. In 1913, the Swiss government proposed a new technical conference to prepare more conventions, which was to be followed by another diplomatic conference in September 1914. However, the First World War halted the development of the international labour dimension for the next five years.11\n\nThe International Labour Organization The ILO was created in 1919 by Part XIII of the Versailles Peace Treaty, which ended the First World War.12 As discussed above, a number of commentators had advocated the need for such an institution in the nineteenth century. Specifically, the ideas advanced by Robert Owen, which were\n\n18\n\nbrian burkett\n\noriginally reflected in the International Association, were subsequently incorporated into the Constitution of the ILO. The factors that ultimately led to the creation of the ILO fall into three broad categories: social, political and economic.13\n\nSocial It is probably fair to say that the primary factor in the creation of the ILO was a shared desire to improve the human condition. This had been a recurring theme in early discussions about the international labour dimension in the nineteenth century. By the end of the First World War, a consensus had been reached that state intervention was required to protect industrial and agrarian workers from harsh working terms and conditions that failed to take into account their health, their family lives and their advancement. A desire to ameliorate existing labour conditions, and to ensure that employers would abide by certain minimum standards related to matters such as wages, working time and the abolition of child labour, is clearly acknowledged in the Preamble to the ILO Constitution, which states that “conditions of labour exist involving . . . injustice, hardship and privation to large numbers of people”.14 Political The creation of the ILO was also a response to the very serious ideological challenges to the status quo made by international socialism and communism. Not surprisingly, scholars have pointed to the 1917 Russian Revolution as a pivotal event in the formation of the ILO, since it impressed upon governments that, absent concrete measures to improve working conditions, growing worker unrest could lead to revolution. The Preamble to the ILO Constitution effectively concedes the ideologically responsive nature of the ILO when it notes that workplace injustice produces “unrest so great that the peace and harmony of the world are imperilled.”15 It is also interesting to note that growing worker unrest in the years prior to 1919 was paralleled by the increasing political influence of the international labour movement. In several European countries, war conditions brought worker organizations into much closer relations with governments. The reorientation of industry for the production of munitions and for supplying the essential needs of the community gave rise to many problems about which governments found it essential to consult worker organizations. As a result, governments became better informed about, and more sympathetic to, worker concerns, while the influence of worker organizations in domestic policy-making expanded significantly.16\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n19\n\nEconomic Although the two factors outlined above – social and political – were crucial to the formation of the ILO, neither necessarily had to be addressed through international cooperation. Domestic initiatives could have been taken to safeguard workers and improve working conditions. What elevated the labour dimension to the international level was the third factor behind the formation of the ILO, namely concerns about competitive advantage in international trade. Improving labour conditions was viewed as potentially having an inflationary impact on the cost of production. Individual countries were reluctant to act unilaterally on worker protection initiatives if this could lead to a competitive disadvantage vis-`a-vis other countries that did not implement similar reforms. Moreover, there were concerns that countries might roll back protective regulations to gain a competitive advantage. Today, this phenomenon goes by various names – “worker protection erosion”, “social dumping”, “the race to the bottom” – to mention three. Because of concerns about this phenomenon, a consensus was reached that distortions in competition on the world economic market could be avoided through international labour standards.17 Hence, the Preamble to the ILO Constitution states that “the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries.”\n\nThe ILO today The number of ILO member states has grown from the original 42 in 1919, to 177 in 2004. Between 1919 and 2003, the ILO promulgated some 185 conventions and 194 recommendations.18 These conventions and recommendations relate to a wide variety of matters of labour law and social policy: fundamental rights (freedom of association, collective bargaining, equality in employment), conditions of work, child labour, protection of women workers, hours of work, labour inspection, vocational guidance and training, social security protection, and occupational health and safety.19 For the purpose of the present discussion, the ILO’s most significant recent accomplishment occurred in 1998, when it promulgated the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (the “Fundamental Declaration”).20 This document provides a consensus definition of the four core labour standards that have become the centrepiece of the\n\n20\n\nbrian burkett\n\nglobal labour standards movement. The Fundamental Declaration holds that the four core standards are: (a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; (b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; (c) the effective abolition of child labour; and (d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The ILO’s position as the preeminent international standard-setting body on labour issues has enabled it to assert substantial influence on the development of regional systems. As will be discussed below, protecting fundamental labour principles has been a focus of discussions within the EU, NAFTA, Mercosur, and the Summit of the Americas Process. Moreover, the debate surrounding a “Social Clause” within the World Trade Organization has largely centred on the proposal to link trade liberalization to respect for the standards set out in the Fundamental Declaration. The ILO thus remains “front and centre” in all discussions about the international labour dimension.21\n\nRegional systems Since the formation of the ILO in 1919, several regional systems have emerged within the international labour dimension. In each case, social, political and economic factors have been driving factors. Below, three existing regional systems are considered, namely, the EU, NAFTA, and Mercosur. Discussion is also included of the Summit of the Americas Process and the negotiations surrounding the proposed FTAA.\n\nThe European Union In discussing the international labour dimension, it is tempting for analytical purposes to group the EU together with other free trade zones, such as NAFTA or Mercosur. However, even a cursory analysis reveals a history, impact and role for the EU beyond that of a trading bloc. The EU is a supranational entity with legislative, judicial and executive powers of its own. The twenty-five member states make up an economic and political confederation, which includes a common currency (among twelve of the member states), common foreign security policy and cooperation on justice and home affairs. Although the labour dimension of the EU is more advanced than in any other regional system, it is important to observe that the European Community (the EU’s predecessor)22 was created for political and economic, rather than social, reasons. As a consequence, a regional social and labour\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n21\n\ndimension has only slowly emerged. In fact, the initial motivation behind creating a common economic market in Europe was primarily political: namely, the prevention of another European war. Following the enormous devastation, both in human and economic terms, of the Second World War, European integrationists argued that the only way to prevent future conflicts was to heighten the interdependence and stability of European nations.23 This was to be achieved through the creation of a supranational authority with powers independent of, and in some cases superior to, national legislatures.24 The first step was the creation of the 1952 European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), through which France, West Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Italy agreed to eliminate tariff and subsidy barriers on their coal and steel industries.25 The same six countries agreed half a decade later to expand on the ECSC to create a common market and harmonize their economic policies. The European Economic Community (EEC) thus came into existence in January 1958 with the ratification of the Treaty of the European Economic Community.26 The main economic goals of the EEC were the prevention of distortions in competition, and the abolition of barriers to the free movement of goods, persons (including workers), services, and capital.27 By mid-1968, internal tariffs had fallen quickly enough to allow the six member states to agree to a common external tariff and to declare that an industrial customs union existed. It was during the period from 1972 to 1980 that the EEC took its first steps toward creating a distinct social dimension through the adoption of “preliminary guidelines for a community’s social policy programme”, drafted by the European Commission in 1971. This led to the Declaration of the heads of state and prime ministers at the 1972 Paris Summit, where the leaders of member states stated that they: attached as much importance to vigorous action in the social field as to the achievement of economic union . . . it is essential to ensure the increased involvement of labour and management in the economic and social decisions of the Community.28\n\nThis Declaration paved the way for the launch of the European Social Fund and the Social Action Programme, adopted by the Council in a resolution in January 1974. The programme concentrated on achieving full and better employment, the improvement of living and working conditions, the movement towards greater industrial democracy for workers, and the\n\n22\n\nbrian burkett\n\nincreased involvement of management and labour in the economic and social decisions of the Community.29 A number of legislative measures also materialized during the 1970s, including Council directives on protecting the acquired rights of workers on redundancy, insolvency and the transfer of an undertaking. A Council directive on equal pay was also adopted, followed by directives on equal treatment in employment and occupational social security.30 A breakthrough in the EU’s labour dimension came with the 1976 decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Defrenne v. Sabena (No. 2)31 , where the Court took the view that Article 141 (equal pay)32 served both economic and social purposes. In view of the different stages of development of social legislation in the various member states, the aim of Article 141 and other European-level social measures was to avoid “social dumping”. The ECJ also stressed that Article 141 forms part of the social objectives of the European Community, which is not merely an economic union, but is intended to ensure social progress and to pursue constant improvement of living and working conditions.33 European-level activities within the social dimension slowed noticeably during the 1980s. Stung by slow economic growth and massive unemployment, EEC members generally followed the direction of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who insisted on deregulation and flexibility, and opposed proposals for numerous Council directives related to labour and social issues.34 Even the Single European Act of 1986, the most important advance in European integration since the Treaty of Rome, was almost singularly concerned with economic policy and harmonization. Pursuant to the Act, the members of the EEC (then numbering twelve) agreed to remove all remaining physical, fiscal and technical barriers to trade.35 By the mid-1980s, however, Jacques Delors, the then President of the European Commission, linked social policy to the objective of realizing a common Internal Market by 1992. Delors argued that the harmonization of social laws was necessary to prevent social dumping and a “race to the bottom”. He envisaged the creation of a “European Social Area” to ensure the protection of social standards in the face of open competition.36 Delors’s vision was at least partly realized in 1989 with the adoption by eleven of the twelve member states37 of the Community Charter of Basic Social Rights (the “Social Charter”). The Social Charter brought together all of the social policy goals that had been mentioned throughout the life of the Community. Drawing upon the core labour conventions of the ILO, the Social Charter guaranteed social improvements in areas such as freedom of movement of workers, living and working conditions, health\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n23\n\nand safety in the workplace, social protection, education and training, and equal treatment (including protection against discrimination on grounds of sex, race, colour, opinion, religion, and protection for migrant workers and nationals of third countries).38 The adoption of the Social Charter was then followed by further developments respecting economic and social integration. At the Maastricht Summit in December 1991, the member states agreed on a revision of the Treaty of Rome, and signed a new treaty on European Union (the “Maastricht Treaty”). This treaty was eventually ratified by the member states and came into force on 1 November 1993. The treaty created a new legal entity called the “European Union”, which was comprised of three pillars: the European Community, and two (mainly) inter-governmental pillars addressing matters relating to justice and home affairs and a common foreign and security policy. The Treaty of Rome was reorganized and renamed the “EC Treaty”.39 In effect, a new union between the twelve member states was created, the jurisdiction of the EU was extended into areas such as consumer protection, public health policy and education, and new rights were given to European citizens, who could now live where they liked in the EU and vote in local and European elections.40 Moreover, the Maastricht Treaty established social and labour market policy as independent policy areas, and fully recognized the right of the social partners (i.e. employer and worker organizations) to be consulted in Europeanlevel decision making.41 By the time of the Amsterdam Treaty, signed in 1997, the role of the EU in promoting harmonization within the social dimension was no longer in dispute. In fact, the Amsterdam Treaty explicitly recognized the importance of social issues within the Community: The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market and an economic and monetary union and by implementing the common policies or activities referred to in Articles 3 and 4, to promote throughout the Community an harmonious and balanced development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, equality between men and women, sustainable and non-inflationary growth, a high degree of competitiveness and convergence of economic performance, a high level of protection and improvement of the environment, the raising of the standard of living and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States.42\n\nPursuant to the Amsterdam Treaty, a new chapter on employment (Articles 125–130) was inserted into the EC Treaty. Under this chapter, the EU is required to promulgate annual employment guidelines to promote\n\n24\n\nbrian burkett\n\nfour major goals: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability, and equal opportunities.43 The member states themselves must adopt more detailed national action plans in order to implement the guidelines.44 Hence, as of 2004, it is clear that the EU and its institutions have a recognized jurisdiction to promote a regional social and labour dimension. Consider the Council of the European Union, the principle legislative institution of the EU, which has formal responsibilities in areas such as: r r r r r r r r r r\n\nfree movement of workers (Article 40 EC Treaty); the establishment of the internal market (Article 95 EC Treaty); workers’ health and safety; working conditions; information and consultation of workers; equality between men and women (Articles 137 and 141 EC Treaty); employment and incentive measures (Articles 128 and 129 EC Treaty); the European Social Fund (Article 148 EC Treaty); vocational training (Article 150 EC Treaty); and economic and social cohesion (Article 162 EC Treaty).45\n\nIt is notable that Article 137 grants to the Council, together with the European Parliament, the power to adopt most measures in the labour dimension by a qualified majority.46 Other matters require either an absolute majority or unanimity.47 In recent times, the EU has placed heavy reliance on non-binding declarations, as opposed to binding regulations and directives, as the preferred means of setting the course of policy. This may be occurring at the expense of implementing more individual and collective social rights that are enforceable against the member states. A critical test of the European Union’s ability to protect social rights will be the implementation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights (the “Charter”). The Charter was signed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission in Nice on 7 December 2000 and was incorporated into the much anticipated European Constitution48 as Part II. The European Constitution, which was signed by all heads of member states on 29 October 2004 in Rome, will only become binding once it is ratified by each member state according to their domestic rules. National referenda are expected to be held by a number of member states during the period from 2004 to 2006.49 The Charter, which is based partly on the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, provides for six categories of rights: dignity, freedoms,\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n25\n\nequality, solidarity, citizens’ rights, and justice. Within these categories, the Charter provides for a number of workers’ rights, including: r freedom of assembly and of association (Article II-72); r freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work (Article\n\nII-75); freedom to conduct a business (Article II-76); non-discrimination (Article II-81); equality between men and women (Article II-83); workers’ right to information and consultation within the undertaking (Article II-87); r right of collective bargaining and strike action (Article II-88); r fair and just working conditions (Article II-91); and r prohibition of child labour and the protection of young people at work (Article II-92). r r r r\n\nA limitation of the Charter is that it does not apply directly to the domestic affairs of member states. Rather, it binds the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union generally and the member states only when they are implementing European Union law.50 Nonetheless, implementation of the Charter as part of the EU Constitution would have signalled a significant advance in the recognition and advancement of social rights at the EU level. The EU has therefore evolved to the point where it has the dual objectives of economic and social advancement. A pan-European labour dimension has emerged in response to the same economic and social factors that were discussed above in relation to the ILO. Critical areas within the labour dimension are poised to gain greater protection at the EU level with the possible ratification of the European Constitution, which includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are, however, important elements within the labour dimension that remain beyond the jurisdiction of the EU to enforce against member states in the operation of their domestic affairs, including freedom of association (i.e. union formation), collective bargaining, and the right to strike. Given political sensitivities, it is doubtful whether the member states will ever be willing to cede jurisdiction over these issues to European-level institutions. Nevertheless, the EU has gone further in developing norms and standards within the labour dimension than any other regional system. It is also the most mature regional system in terms of institutions and processes. Going forward, the greatest challenge facing the EU will be the integration of its ten newest member states, which joined the EU on 1 May 2004.51\n\n26\n\nbrian burkett\n\nThe new members not only increase the size and population of the EU, but the disparity of wealth between the new and existing member states will result in a dramatic reduction of per person GDP. In addition, harmonizing the less developed labour and social policies of the new member states with those of the existing members may prove exceedingly difficult in the short to medium term. The EU could well find itself in a position similar to participants in the Summit of the Americas Process (discussed below), namely, searching for an integration strategy to address disparate levels of development and significant structural differences among member states.\n\nNAFTA The Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States of America52 (FTA) came into effect in January 1989, creating a free trade zone between Canada and the United States. The FTA itself contained no discernible social or labour dimension. In fact, a link between trade liberalization and labour or environmental standards was denied by supporters of the FTA. Only two years later, negotiations began for a trilateral free trade agreement that would include Mexico, and would build on and supercede the FTA. After intense national debates respecting the social, political, and economic consequences of such an agreement, Canada, the United States and Mexico concluded the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in January 1994.53 NAFTA essentially creates a free trade zone in goods, and significantly liberalizes the treatment of investment, intellectual property, and services across the continent. The relationships and histories of the three NAFTA member states have shaped the form and substantive provisions of NAFTA. While there are many reasons for Canada, the United States and Mexico to develop closer economic relations, the social, political and cultural dynamics that drove the creation and evolution of the EEC after the Second World War simply did not exist in North America in the early 1990s. Moreover, as a result of the historical experiences of Canada, the United States and Mexico, each country has manifested a strong desire to preserve its sovereignty in the face of economic integration. The sheer size and power of the United States has made both Canada and Mexico reluctant to integrate socially and politically within North America. This is a dynamic that has traditionally not existed within the European Union, where the member states have been more balanced in terms of political and economic power.54 The high priority placed on sovereignty by the three NAFTA countries is most evident in the ancillary nature of the continental social and labour dimensions that ultimately emerged. Rather than attempting to\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n27\n\nharmonize labour standards as in the EU, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to a mechanism that allows each country the opportunity to challenge the enforcement by the other countries of their national labour laws. This mechanism is contained in the North American Agreement on Labour Cooperation (the NAALC),55 a supplementary side agreement to the NAFTA. The impetus for the NAALC came predominantly from political circumstances in the United States. During the NAFTA negotiations, the American environmental and labour movements argued that free trade would produce social dumping and a destructive “race to the bottom”. Bill Clinton, who was at the time the Democratic Party nominee for President and who had initially supported George H. W. Bush’s tradeoriented agenda, made his support of NAFTA contingent, in part, on linking trade liberalization to improved environmental and labour standards. Upon taking power, Clinton responded to the environmental concerns by concluding the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation.56 Further, to assuage fears of American workers and unions about the consequences of the “race to the bottom” (and particularly the loss of jobs to Mexico), Clinton negotiated the NAALC. The negotiations surrounding the substantive provisions of the NAALC revealed the difficulties of implementing a labour dimension as an aspect of trade liberalization among countries of disparate levels of development. In the United States, the labour movement was most concerned that the creation of a free trade zone between two developed countries (Canada and the United States) and a developing country (Mexico) would lead to significant competitive pressures to lower labour standards in the developed countries. On the other hand, the Clinton administration argued that existing Mexican labour laws were sufficiently protective, and maintained that the problem was the lack of enforcement of these laws.57 In response, Mexico argued that its labour laws were as progressive as those of Canada and the United States, and that enforcement problems were a result of a lack of governmental resources.58 For its part, Canada maintained that enforcement procedures should be improved in Mexico, but argued that each member state should remain free to set its own labour standards.59 The agreement that was finally negotiated did not commit to harmonizing labour standards of the three countries. Moreover, the inclusion of a NAFTA-level enforcement process for labour issues was rejected. In fact, the NAALC recognizes that laws and standards will differ, and that each nation may chart its own course. As a result, the agreement simply requires\n\n28\n\nbrian burkett\n\nthe NAFTA countries to enforce their own labour laws, with no formal requirement that those laws be consistent with internationally agreed core labour standards such as those in the Fundamental Declaration. However, under the NAALC, the NAFTA countries have undertaken to ensure that labour laws and regulations provide for “high labour standards”. Pursuant to Article 1, each nation has committed itself to promoting in its own way the ideals contained in three tiers in Annex I, which include core labour principles such as: the protection of the right to organize, bargain and strike; the prohibition of forced labour, the protection of migrant labour, the elimination of employment discrimination and the pursuit of equality including equal pay for equal work; the protection of occupational health and safety, the prohibition of child labour and the protection of minimum wages. It is notable that only three areas – occupational health and safety, child labour and minimum wages – are subject to the full dispute resolution and enforcement provisions of the NAALC. The NAALC obligates member states to enforce their own labour laws in the subject areas set out in Annex I, and provides that if a member state believes that another is not doing so, it may launch a complaint to the Commission for Labour Cooperation. Such a complaint is first referred to a Council composed of the labour secretaries/ministers of each member state. The Council, which establishes its own rules and procedures, first attempts to resolve the complaint through consultation and cooperation. A pattern of non-compliance in certain subject areas could result in the appointment of an outside group of experts to make non-binding recommendations. Failing resolution at this level, a complaint that deals with laws regarding occupational health and safety, child labour or minimum wages could eventually proceed through various layers of investigation and consultations at the ministerial level to an arbitration before a panel, and the imposition of sanctions. In order for the Council to convene an arbitral panel, the matter at issue must be both trade-related and be covered by mutually recognized labour laws.60 The National Administrative Offices (NAOs) of member states may ignore a complaint altogether, investigate the complaint but not report the outcome, or refuse to recommend that the complaint be made the subject of ministerial consultation. Likewise, labour ministers involved in the government-to-government consultations are not bound by rules or guidelines regarding the consideration of individual cases. As a result, the cases that have proceeded under the NAALC in Canada, the United States and Mexico have had varying results. The desire of the NAFTA countries\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n29\n\nto avoid the harmonization of labour laws and a multinational judicial process has resulted in an instrument that lacks an effective enforcement mechanism. On balance, it is clear that economic issues have been the central feature of the NAFTA, and that the labour dimension of NAFTA is really ancillary. The NAALC has not made any notable progress in promoting continental social and labour integration, nor has it created an effective enforcement mechanism to ensure that each NAFTA country complies with its own domestic labour standards. However, the NAALC does create a link between trade and labour, and in this sense it breaks new ground by creating labour relations obligations in the context of an agreement to liberalize trade. This is particularly evident in the work of the NAALC Secretariat, which is based in Washington, DC. This unique multinational institution, which includes labour economists, lawyers and other professionals, is devoted to advancing labour standards as an integral part of expanding trade relations. The Secretariat has two principal functions. First, the Secretariat serves as the general administrative arm of the Commission. It provides support to the Council, as well as to evaluation committees of experts and arbitral panels established by the Council. Second, it undertakes research and analysis, and prepares public reports on: labour law and administrative procedures; trends and administrative strategies related to the implementation and enforcement of labour law; labour market conditions such as employment rates, average wages and labour productivity; and human resource development issues such as training and adjustment programmes. The Secretariat supports the cooperative activities of the Commission, including seminars, conferences, joint research projects and technical assistance in relation to the eleven labour principles of the NAALC, as well as labour statistics, productivity, and other related matters. Recent cooperative activities include trilateral seminars of the Labour Boards in North America, technical workshops on occupational health and safety management systems, migrant and immigrant worker forums as well as tri-national conferences on violence in the workplace. The cooperative activities have created a process through which member states may share best practices, exchange knowledge and develop educational programs – potentially a precursor to further regional cooperation in the social and labour dimensions.\n\nMercosur ´ del The Southern Cone Common Market (in Spanish, Mercado Comun Sur – commonly referred to as “Mercosur”) provides another important\n\n30\n\nbrian burkett\n\nexample of a trading bloc that has pursued the development of a regional labour dimension. Mercosur was formed in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, ´ 61 This treaty proParaguay and Uruguay through the Treaty of Asuncion. vided for the liberalization of trade in goods between the member states, implemented a common external tariff, and proclaimed Mercosur’s ambition to become a common market in which goods, services, capital, and labour would circulate freely.62 With 240 million consumers (compared with 380 million in NAFTA), Mercosur’s regional system is one of the world’s most important. Since its creation in 1991, Mercosur’s mandate has included a social dimension that links social and labour issues with trade interests. The ´ clearly stipulated the objective of accelerating the Treaty of Asuncion processes of economic development through social justice, and securing a better standard of living for the inhabitants of the member countries.63 This makes Mercosur notable among the world’s leading regional trading blocs, since social development was a priority from the outset, as opposed to an ancillary point. This is perhaps not surprising, though, since the member states of Mercosur each shared pressing social and political problems prior to 1991. The development of a common market among these countries was viewed not simply as an economic development project, but also as a means to achieve improvements in social standards and to promote political stability through multilateral interdependence. Running parallel to the humanitarian and political imperatives of Mercosur was a familiar concern about social dumping – given the geographic proximity of member states, capital could all too easily move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in order to exploit lower (and cheaper) labour standards. Avoiding a “race to the bottom” therefore required proactive and coordinated measures at the Mercosur level on social standards. A review of Mercosur’s achievements with respect to the labour dimension demonstrates a progression from an initial emphasis on process issues, to the creation of Mercosur-level institutions with a labour dimension mandate, to the promulgation of social and labour standards. An appropriate starting point is “Working Subgroup No. 11”, a tripartite body fine-tuned in 1991 for the express purpose of giving effect to the labour dimension of Mercosur. At its inception, matters related to the labour market, labour relations, employment and social security were referred to this Subgroup. Through the work of its Technical Commissions, the Subgroup was able to develop diagnostic exercises and comparative studies, detecting asymmetries among the members’ systems with a view towards harmonization and convergence in areas such as individual and collective\n\nthe international labour dimension\n\n31\n\nrights, employment, vocational training, labour occupational health and social security. The Subgroup also took on the task of reviewing international labour conventions and identifying those it considered essential for developing multilateral agreements to standardize national labour legislation. The result of this project was the identification of 35 ILO conventions, including those covering the core labour principles that were eventually incorporated into the Fundamental Declaration. The work of the Subgroup, largely completed by 1995, was crucial for gaining insights into the national realities of the member states, and was arguably the necessary first step before any substantive initiatives in the labour dimension could be taken at the Mercosur level.64 The “Ouro Preto Protocol” of 1994 was the next notable development, as it triggered the creation of an institutional structure within Mercosur for dealing with the labour dimension. Two bodies emerged. First, “Working Subgroup No. 10” was established in May 1996 with responsibility for labour issues, employment and social security. This Subgroup followed the objectives and tripartite structure of its predecessor, Subgroup No. 11, but its mandate was expanded considerably. Second, an “Economic and Social Advisory Forum” was created for the express purpose of facilitating cooperation between employer and worker representatives. The Forum was also open to other social groups including consumer associations, cooperatives and academics.65 During the period 1996–8, Subgroup No. 10 pursued its mandate of considering mechanisms to ensure the effective improvement of social and labour conditions within the region.
