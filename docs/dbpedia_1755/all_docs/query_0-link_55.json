Albania (29 July 2008) Arben Xheraj, who was acquitted of murder charges in 1998, complained that the fact that the public prosecutor had been able to lodge an appeal out of time had resulted in the reopening of the proceedings against him, effectively annulling his acquittal. He argued that this amounted to trying him twice for the same crime. The Court considered what had happened in this case to be a resumption of the previous proceedings, rather than an attempt to hold a new trial. It also held that allowing the public prosecutor to lodge an appeal out of time had infringed the principle of legal certainty.
