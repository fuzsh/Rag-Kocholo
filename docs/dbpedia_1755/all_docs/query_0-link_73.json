        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThis book is dedicated to my parents Kathleen and Frank Mullally.\n\nSeries Editor’s Preface Dr Siobhán Mullally’s monograph is a valuable addition to the Series. Dr Mullally examines a range of feminist criticisms of human rights discourse and highlights the problems with the norms and institutions of international human rights law as they currently operate. Dr Mullally travels from theory to practice and includes case studies which draw upon developments in Pakistan, India and Ireland. A central theme of this book is the call for the universal discourse of human rights to be reshaped and reclaimed. Dr Mullally does not underestimate the scale of the task and the difficulties and challenges are comprehensively reviewed. However, the suggestion is that the potential of universalism might still be realised. This will, as Dr Mullally argues, require the reconstruction of the theory and practice of human rights and Gender, Culture and Human Rights: Reclaiming Universalism is a significant contribution to that process. Colin Harvey Belfast April 2006\n\nAcknowledgements This book builds on a doctoral dissertation completed at the European University Institute, Florence. I would like to thank Philip Alston, for his support and encouragement throughout this project and for encouraging a clearer sense of direction and purpose in my work. Much of the later stages of this work were completed while I was on a visiting fellowship at the Gender, Sexuality, Family and Human Rights Programme at Cornell Law School. I am grateful to Martha Fineman for her encouragement and helpful insights throughout my work, in particular, for many comments and discussions on the meaning of autonomy, care and the role of religion / culture in structuring gender relations. I was fortunate to meet many friends and colleagues through the Gender, Sexuality and Family Programme, and am particularly grateful to Reg Graycar, George Pavlakos and Ruth Fletcher for their support, encouragement and advice. I am grateful to Colin Harvey and Neil Walker for their insightful critiques of earlier drafts of this work and for encouraging me to see this through to the final stages of publication. Thanks are due to Henry Steiner for providing me with the opportunity to spend a semester as a visiting fellow on the Harvard Human Rights Program. Thanks are due also to Seyla Benhabib for generously sending on unpublished work and responding to my questions. Earlier drafts of this work were presented at Harvard Law School, Sydney Law School, Osgoode Hall, York University, Beaseley School of Law, Temple University, Keele Law School, Peshawar University, National Law School of India, Bangalore, Free University of Amsterdam. The many comments, suggestions and questions raised at those seminars have helped me to clarify my thoughts and to rethink many earlier ideas. Many friends and colleagues at the Law Faculty, University College Cork, helped me at critical stages of this work, including, Mary Donnelly, John Mee, Olivia Smith, Shane Kilcommins and Caroline Fennell. The British Council provided funding for an ongoing exchange programme in human rights law with the University of Peshawar, Pakistan. The opportunity to teach and research that this programme provided has given me invaluable insights into law and society in Pakistan. My research in Pakistan was helped by very good friends. For their support, friendship and unfailing good humour, I would like to thank Kamran Arif, Javaid Rehman, Shaheen Sardar-Ali, Ayesha Shahid. My thanks are also due to Shashikala Gurpur Murphy, for her hospitality and many keen insights into the women’s movement in India. Thanks also to Patricia Brennan for her friendship and assistance during my stay in Cambridge MA in 1999.\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThank you to all the McDonnells in Hull for their continuous friendship, good humour and support. For always being the best of friends and for encouraging me to persist with this work, Fitz, Elaine and Winifred. Most of all, I want to thank my parents, Frank and Kathleen, and my brothers, Robert and Tony, for their constant support over many years. And finally thanks to Pat and to my beautiful daughter Bríona, without whom I would found this task much more difficult and much less rewarding.

Building a just and equal society required the recognition and enforcement of equal rights for women. Early liberal feminists saw their task as being a relatively straightforward, if daunting one. Liberal political theory ascribed rights to human beings on the basis of their capacity for reason. The task for feminism was to show that women had the same capacity for rationality and moral action as did men and to claim for women the same rights as were ascribed to men.1 With the growth of the international human rights movement, the refrain ‘women’s rights are human rights’ became a familiar rallying cry.2 Liberal feminists sought to add women in to the growing body of human rights norms, appealing to women and men’s common humanity and their capacity for reason as a justificatory basis for their claims to equal rights. In recent years, however, feminism has become increasingly sceptical of such appeals. Feminism has come to be defined in opposition to universalism and the terms of Enlightenment philosophy. The discourse of human rights has been a central tenet of Enlightenment philosophy, an indispensable tool in the pursuit of justice and equality. It is now accused, however, of being ‘an active enemy of women’s progress’.3 At the heart of this critique is a concern with difference, differences between women and men and between women themselves. Difference feminism has defined itself in opposition to a Kantian universalism that is accused of not only abstracting from difference but also rendering difference irrelevant. Difference feminisms include feminist critiques of liberalism and include, in particular, feminisms that emphasise the significance of differences, whether rooted in sex, gender, class, sexuality, religion or other N ITS LIBERAL\n\n1\n\nM Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (London, Penguin Classics, 1985).

Nicola Lacey describes difference feminism as based on a ‘complex idea of equality which accommodates and values, whilst not fixing, women’s specificity as women’.4 Feminism’s concern with women’s specificity has expanded to include a concern with religious, cultural and other differences and has led to alliances between feminist, postmodern and communitarian thinkers.5 Underpinning these alliances is a suspicion of the universalistic discourse of rights. In place of universalistic claims, difference feminists emphasise the role of local, contextual judgments, the social construction of the human self and the constitutive role of communities and inherited traditions. Instead of the ideal of the autonomous, freely choosing self, Carol Gilligan, Drucilla Cornell, Luce Irigaray, Iris Young and others, emphasise the specificity of women’s bodies, life-patterns and modes of moral reasoning6 and reject the abstractions of human rights discourse. The challenge to the unitary category ‘woman’ has come from two main sources: the theoretical advance of post-structuralism and from Black, Minority Ethnic and Third World women who have been ignored or rendered invisible by the false universalism that has underpinned much of liberal feminism. Black feminists and critical race feminists have taken the lead in unmasking the particular woman embodied in the unitary category ‘woman’. This process of unmasking has required White women to recognize their own role and agency as oppressors, however unwitting.7 Within the context of international human rights law, critical race feminists have\n\n4 N Lacey, Unspeakable Subjects: Feminist Essays in Legal and Social Theory (Oxford, Hart Publishing, 1998) 4. 5 See generally: A Bunting, ‘Theorizing Women’s Cultural Diversity in Feminist International Human Rights Strategies’ 20(1) Journal of Law and Society 6; E Brems, ‘Enemies or Allies—Feminism and Cultural Relativism as Dissident Voices in Human-rights Discourse’ (1997) 19(1) Human Rights Quarterly 136; TE Higgins, ‘Anti-essentialism, Relativism and Human Rights’ (1996) 19 Harvard Women’s Law Journal 89; R Kapur, ‘A Love Song to Our Mongrel Selves: Hybridity, Sexuality and the Law’ (1999) 8(3) Social and Legal Studies 353; R Kapur, ‘The Tragedy of Victimzation Rhetoric: Resurrecting the “Native” Subject in International/Post-colonial Feminist Legal Politics’ (2002) 15 Harvard Human Rights Journal 2. 6 C Gilligan, In a Different Voice Psychological Theory and Women’s Development (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1982); D Cornell, Beyond Accommodation: Ethical Feminism, Deconstruction and the Law (London, Routledge, 1991); IM Young, Inclusion and Democracy (Oxford, OUP, 2000); IM Young, Justice and the Politics of Difference (Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1990); R West, ‘Jurisprudence and Gender’ in K Bartlett and R Kennedy, (eds), Feminist Legal Theory: Readings in Law and Gender (Boulder, CO, Westview Press, 1991) 201. 7 To quote Audre Lorde, writing more than twenty years ago: ‘As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define [woman] in terms of their own experience alone, then women of Color become “other”, the outsider whose experience and tradition is too “alien” to comprehend’.

It is a tendency that can be seen in debates on the problem of human trafficking, in legal and political discourses in France surrounding the wearing of the hijab and in debates within international human rights fora on the practice of female genital mutilation. Lesbian feminists and feminists with disabilities have also challenged the conventional construction of womanhood underpinning international instruments such as the 1979 UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Until recently, a prevailing ‘ideology of heterosexuality’ rendered lesbian women’s concerns invisible within the international human rights movement. Morris has pointed to the way in which feminist research on care and the ethics of care frequently constructed the category ‘woman’ so as to exclude women with disabilities.10 Similarly, women with disabilities were often ignored by disability rights activists who treated concerns raised by women as particular or marginal. The concern with difference has led, for some feminists, to a shift away from universalism and, for others, to a call for a ‘differentiated universalism,’11 in which the achievement of universalism is always contingent upon attention to difference. The challenge is to define a universalism that is interactive, not legislating, that is gender sensitive rather than gender blind, contextually sensitive and not situation indifferent.12 Difference feminisms have provided us with a timely reminder of the many unfulfilled promises of human rights discourse. However, to the extent that difference feminisms are suggesting a move away from human rights discourse and the commitment to universality that underpins it, its claims are flawed. A commitment to the universalistic principles of human rights is not necessarily at odds with feminist struggles. Feminism encounters many difficulties when it defines itself in opposition to universalism and moves away from the discourse of human rights. The shift away from universalism is damaging both for feminist theory and practice, endangering\n\n8 See, for example, R Kapur, ‘The Tragedy of Victimization Rhetoric: Resurrecting the “Native” Subject in International/Post-colonial Feminist Legal Politics’ (2002) 15 Harvard Human Rights Journal 2. 9 C Mohanty, ‘Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses’ (1988) 30 Feminist Review 61. 10 J Morris, Pride Against Prejudice (London, Women’s Press, 1991); J Morris, (ed), Encounters with Strangers: Feminism and Disability (London, Women’s Press, 1996). 11 This term is borrowed from: R Lister, Citizenship: Feminist Perspectives, 2nd edn, (New York, NYU Press, 2003) 91. 12 S Benhabib, Situating the Self: Gender, Community and Postmodernism in Contemporary Ethics (Cambridge, Polity Press, 1992) 3.\n\nxxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nboth the pursuit of an emancipatory agenda and the flourishing of difference that feminism so greatly values. Of course, claims to universal validity and inclusion have often masked the unequal treatment of those who were ‘silently excluded’.13 Diane Otto, in a recent essay on the struggle for the inclusion of women in the paradigm of universal human rights, asks whether ‘women’s full inclusion in the universal register may indeed be an impossibility’?14 Ultimately, she concludes, however, that it is too soon to reject the project of universal human rights and opts instead for a destabilizing and particularizing of the ‘masculine universal’.15 As Otto recognizes, it is not universalism per se that is the problem but rather Eurocentric hegemonies posing as universalism.16 Universalism, properly understood, is deeply sensitive to difference. As Habermas has noted in his essay on ‘The Inclusion of the Other’, ‘Equal respect for everyone is not limited to those who are like us; it extends to the person of the other in his or her otherness ... those who are strangers to one another and want to remain strangers’.17 A moral universalism that is sensitive to difference demands a ‘nonleveling and nonappropriating inclusion of the other’.18 The criticisms advanced by difference feminists, such as Ratna Kapur19 or Karen Engle,20 are based on a belief that the misuse of universalism exhausts its limits—that universal norms can only represent a false universality, an imaginary common humanity. Certainly, human rights discourse has not yet fulfilled its promises and human rights law and practice remains deeply flawed. Abandoning the universalistic discourse of human rights, however, will not assist feminism in its pursuit of a complex equality. Reconciling feminism with universalism may be possible but this reconciliation requires us to move beyond the metaphysical illusions of Enlightenment theories of rights.

Within international law, these include Diane Otto,22 Doris Buss,23 Ambreena Manji,24 Karen Knop,25 Patricia Viseur Sellars,26 Christine Chinkin,27 Hilary Charlesworth,28 to name but a few. Underpinning these attempts is a recognition of the need to move beyond the postmodernist celebration of diversity to contemplations of how difference can be accommodated politically and oppression and injustice challenged. Judith Squires argues that this move requires ‘a clearly formed and articulated set of values, ethical standpoints and evaluative criteria.’29 This set of values, standpoints and criteria can be found, I argue, in the universalistic discourse of human rights, properly understood. If feminism is to be truly global, however, a powerful and persuasive way of relating the universal and the particular must be found. The negotiation and recognition of difference continues to be a pressing concern for feminism, a concern that can be seen in the processes of constitutional negotiation in societies as diverse as Iraq, Afghanistan, the European Union, East Timor.

Religious and cultural claims do not, of course, exhaust the limits of claims to difference. They raise particular questions, however, of the institutions and strategies necessary to recognize difference and it is on these questions that this book focuses. A. FEMINISM, DISCOURSE ETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nFeminist critiques of rights have centred on three main themes: (a) the disembedded and disembodied subject of rights; (b) the validity of rights claims grounded on a universal legislating reason; and (c) the ability of a universal, legislating reason to tackle the multiplicity of contexts and life-situations with which practical reason is always confronted.30 Rights discourse is accused of pitching the individual against the community, the universal against the particular, the public against the private. Within liberal theories of rights, the subject of human rights is a divided one, ‘caught between the moral law and the starry heaven above and the earthly body below’.31 Although striving for unity, it is plagued by tensions, between ‘autonomy and nurturance, independence and bonding, sovereignty of the self and relations to others’.32 These dichotomies are deeply hierarchical and also deeply gendered. The discourse of human rights is accused of privileging one side of these dichotomies and marginalising the other. Included amongst the marginalised and excluded are those voices associated with the private, the particular, the affective bases of moral judgement. These include women, the poor, the working class, gays, lesbians, people of colour. All are excluded from a polity that prides itself as being cosmopolitan. In chapter 1, I examine these critiques and look at feminism’s departure from the liberal discourse of rights, focusing on three main strands of feminist theory: Carol Gilligan’s feminist Ethics of Care; Catharine MacKinnon’s radical feminism and postmodern feminisms. Each of these strands proposes alternative strategies for feminism yet none provide the resources necessary to build an emancipatory feminist movement or to defend gender equality in the face of competing cultural claims. Gilligan’s relational view of the human self renders the human subject vulnerable to communitarian claims. This problem is recognised by MacKinnon, who rejects the claims of Ethics of Care theorists. However, MacKinnon, herself, continues to define feminism in opposition to the universalist discourse of human rights, preferring instead the methods and claims of civil rights movements. Civil rights movements, she says, begin in small places, close to home.\n\n30 31 32\n\nS Benhabib, above n 2, p 3. Ibid, p 86. Ibid.\n\nFeminism, Discourse Ethics and Human Rights\n\nxxxv\n\nBecause of this, she argues, they are more likely to reflect the concrete lived experiences of women’s lives. Within MacKinnon’s writings, however, the distinction between civil rights and human rights movements, becomes increasingly blurred. While her criticisms may be valid in relation to the received traditions of human rights law, once we move beyond these inherited traditions, they become difficult to sustain. Postmodern feminisms also criticise the troubled legacies of international human rights law. Underpinning the various strands of postmodern feminist critique is a suspicion of universalistic claims and a concern to ensure that the significance of difference is recognised. The institutions and procedures necessary to ensure a flourishing of difference, however, require a universalistic framework if their claims are to be sustained. A political sphere deprived of any universal reference ends up operating in line with a kind of law of the jungle, where might is right and the dominant voices determine which cultural claims will prevail. The insistence that we avoid all universal imperatives leads: ... either to an irrationalist embrace of the agnostics of opposition [Lyotard]—to put it more simply, the adoption by default of the universal principle that might is right; or to the sunny complacency of pragmatism [Rorty], in which it is assumed that we can never ground our activities in ethical principles which have more force than just saying ‘this is the sort of thing we do, because it suits us.’33\n\nAgainst the background of such agnosticism, gender equality cannot make any claim to universal legitimacy. This leads to particular difficulties when feminism is faced with negotiating conflicting cultural claims. There are other difficulties with feminist critiques of human rights discourse. In each strand of feminist theory that we explore, we see that the target of critique, the universalistic discourse of human rights, is, in many ways, a straw target. Much of the feminist critique is an attack, not on human rights discourse per se, but rather on the liberal traditions of human rights inherited from Enlightenment thinkers. Many contemporary human rights theorists have sought to move beyond these troubled legacies, to expand the scope of the moral domain and to recognise the relations and networks within which any human self finds herself. Chapters 2 and 3 look at the work of two contemporary human rights theorists who have taken such steps, Alan Gewirth34 and John Rawls.35 Both Gewirth and Rawls 33 S Connor, Postmodernist Culture: An Introduction to Theories of the Contemporary (Oxford, Blackwell, 1989) 243. 34 A Gewirth, The Community of Rights (Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, 1996); A Gewirth, Human Rights Essays on Justification and Applications (Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, 1982); A Gewirth, Reason and Morality (Chicago, IL, University of Chicago Press, 1978). 35 See in particular: J Rawls, The Law of Peoples (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1999); J Rawls, Political Liberalism (Columbia, NY, Columbia University Press, 1993); J Rawls, A Theory of Justice (Oxford, OUP, 1972).\n\nxxxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nhave addressed communitarian, and to a lesser extent, feminist critiques of rights. In the work of both Gewirth and Rawls, we see the potential to transform human rights discourse, drawing on the critiques raised by difference feminists. As we shall see, however, neither Gewirth nor Rawls realises this potential. Gewirth’s Community of Rights contains much that is of interest to feminism. Ultimately, however, Gewirth fails to address the concerns raised by difference feminists. His failure is largely due to the methods he employs, in particular, his appeal to a universal legislating reason as a normative justification for human rights claims. Within Gewirth’s justificatory strategy, inter-subjectivity is neither necessary nor possible. The individual agent is the quintessential ‘lonely geometrician’.36 To resolve moral conflicts, she need not consult with any other. She simply applies the canons of deductive and inductive logic to the normative structure of action—without consulting any other agent. The failure of rights discourse to engage with concrete others and to recognise the differentiated subject of human rights has been highlighted in the insights of relational feminism.37 Gewirth recognises the shortcomings of the isolated, atomistic subject of rights discourse. However, he fails to overcome these shortcomings. His failure is due, at least, in part, to his concern that a situated self might be vulnerable to communal claims. He is concerned to avoid the slide into moral conventionalism that we see in communitarian thinking. These concerns, of course, are well-founded and are particularly pertinent to feminists who have often found their claims denied in the name of family, community or nation. The challenge for human rights is to situate the self in gender and community, but to retain the capacity for reflection and critique. As we shall see, Gewirth ultimately fails to meet this challenge and can offer only limited assistance to the feminist project of reclaiming universalism. Chapters 3 and 4 explore Rawls’s response to this challenge and Martha Nussbaum’s ‘friendly amendment’ to Rawlsian political liberalism. In Political Liberalism (PL) and the Law of Peoples (LP), Rawls attempts to accommodate the concerns raised by communitarian and to a lesser extent, feminist critics. His Theory of Justice (TJ) is modified and applied only to political spheres. This leads to difficulties, however, for the pursuit of gender equality. Ultimately, Rawls tries too hard to accommodate the concerns of cultural conservatives. His theory of justice begins to lose its critical edge. We see this loss, in particular, in his deference to cultural claims in\n\n36\n\nSee: Benhabib, above n 21.

His appeal to an overlapping consensus leaves feminism vulnerable to the demands of decent hierarchical societies. Although Rawls draws the line at the demands of ‘outlaw states’, he yields too much ground along the way, accommodating difference by drawing lines between the political and the nonpolitical. Justice as fairness is limited in scope and applied only to the political sphere. His division between the political and non-political means that many questions of gender inequality remain beyond the reach of political liberalism. As a result, feminist critiques of human rights discourse remain unanswered. Martha Nussbaum attempts to correct Rawls’s failings by proposing a ‘friendly amendment to liberalism’,38 an amendment that redraws the boundaries between the public and the private. Nussbaum seeks to return feminism to universalism and to reconcile feminism and the universalistic discourse of human rights. For Nussbaum, the moral domain extends much further into the private, domestic spheres than does Rawls’s political liberalism or his Law of Peoples. Her list of central human capabilities offers the possibility of expanding the domain of human rights discourse, of breaking down the gendered distinctions between the public and the private. Nussbaum continues, however, to appeal to an overlapping consensus as a justificatory basis for her list of central capabilities. This raises some difficulties, potentially limiting the pursuit of a critical feminist agenda. As Bruce Ackerman points out, liberalism risks losing its critical edge if it becomes no more than a rationalisation of conventional wisdom.39 On questions of gender inequality, consensus is particularly difficult to achieve. There is also the question of how cultural conflicts are to be negotiated. What institutions and procedures are necessary to negotiate such conflicts? Nussbaum’s more recent work pays greater attention to the importance of democratic participation, particularly in negotiating conflicting cultural claims.40 However, she doesn’t engage in any detail with the processes of reform, or the institutions and procedures necessary to bring about reforms. As noted earlier, this failure has been a gap in feminist critical theory. Discourse ethics and deliberative models of democracy attempt to fill the gap between critical theory and proposals for institutional reform. Chapter 5 examines this attempt, focussing, in particular, on the work of Seyla Benhabib. Benhabib proposes a dual-track approach to cultural conflicts, one that takes account both of the need for legal regulation and for an expanded moral–political dialogue. Like Nussbaum, Benhabib attempts to\n\n38\n\nSee: M Nussbaum, Sex and Social Justice (Oxford, OUP, 1999) 38.

The methods, she adopts, however, offer greater possibilities of bringing about this reconciliation. Rather than appealing to an overlapping consensus or to a single comprehensive doctrine, discourse ethics relies on a virtuous circle—a dialectical process of reflecting on the ‘universal and necessary presuppositions of communicative speech.’41 These presuppositions are identified by Benhabib as the core moral principles of universal respect and egalitarian reciprocity.42 For her, these core moral principles define the limits of reasonable pluralism. They provide a normative framework within which conflicting cultural claims must be negotiated, whether arising in spheres defined as political or domestic. The compromises that we see in political liberalism are avoided, without, however, returning to the metaphysical illusions of Enlightenment thinking. B. DISCOURSE ETHICS, FEMINISM AND THE ‘CLASH OF CULTURES’\n\nBenhabib’s appeal to the idea of an ongoing moral–political dialogue and a global dialogical community seeks to ensure that individual women are given a voice and can participate in the articulation and implementation of human rights norms. This emphasis on participation overcomes the welfarism of many proposals for reform. It also offers us a process within which cultural differences can be mediated while at the same time defining the limits of reasonable pluralism. The remaining chapters look at attempts to mediate cultural differences and to define the limits of cultural claims at an international level, in the context of reservations to the 1979 UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (hereinafter CEDAW), and at national levels in family law and reproductive rights debates in three post-colonial states, Ireland, India and Pakistan. Chapter 6 explores the so-called ‘reservations dialogue’,43 surrounding CEDAW. Invoking the requirements of domestic law, religious–cultural traditions and the rights of religious communities, many states have opted out of the expanding international human rights agenda. Treaty provisions encroaching upon relations within the family have led to particular difficulties. States have resisted this expansion of international human rights law, and adopting a Rawlsian strategy, have attempted to restrict the application\n\n41 See J Habermas, ‘Discourse Ethics: Notes on a Program of Philosophical Justification’ in J Habermas, C Lenhardt and SW Nicholsen, (trs), Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 1990) 43, 86. 42 S Benhabib, above n 12, p 29. 43 This term is borrowed from A Pellet (Special Rapporteur) 6th Report on Reservations to Treaties, International Law Commission, 53rd session, UN GAOR A/CN4/518, 3 May 2001.\n\nDiscourse Ethics, Feminism and the ‘Clash of Cultures’\n\nxxxix\n\nof human rights standards to domains labelled as private and domestic. Anti-essentialist feminists, drawing on various strands within postmodern feminisms, have criticized the increasingly universalistic stance taken by the international human rights movement. This shift away from universalism leads to difficulties in responding to the claims made by reserving states and in attempting to limit states’ claims to opt out of international human rights standards. All too often, states appeal to the rhetoric of difference, self-determination and post-colonial resistance. International human rights law is accused of reflecting the norms and values of western, liberal societies. The claims made by reserving states pose a dilemma for feminism, particularly given the increasing sensitivity to cultural and other differences within feminist movements. The shift away from universalism within feminist theory adds to these difficulties, as feminism can often claim no greater legitimacy for its claims than the assertions made by reserving states. Legalistic responses to reservations such as those rooted in the Vienna Convention treaty regime, do little to overcome the polarization of debates between reserving and objecting states. I suggest that discourse ethics and the dual-track approach to cultural conflicts, can add to this debate, giving feminism greater support for its claims while, at the same time, bringing an openness and dynamism that allows for change and for a recognition of dissenting voices within diverse cultures and traditions. This openness, in turn, creates opportunities to call international human rights law to account for its claims to universality. Chapters 7 to 10 examine the conflicting cultural claims that have arisen in three states: Ireland; India and Pakistan. These three states share common constitutional backgrounds and a post-colonial history. In each, feminism has struggled to overcome the obstacles posed by religious–cultural claims. The deference paid to such claims has led to highly gendered divisions between the public and the private and a rejection of universal norms guaranteeing equality for women within domains labelled as private. In Ireland, a conservative Roman Catholic ethos provided a legitimising ideology for the nascent nation-state. This brought with it a strict uni-duality of gender roles and identities, entrenching an ideology of separate spheres in Ireland’s constitutional text and in the fundamental rights jurisprudence that followed. The challenges that feminism has faced within the Irish context highlight the difficulties that arise in the absence of a normative framework that can claim a universal legitimacy. For many years, fundamental rights jurisprudence in Ireland developed on the basis of a conception of the good that was rooted in conservative Roman Catholic traditions. Fundamental rights were identified by appealing to the ‘ethical values, which all Christians living in the State acknowledge and accept’.44 The claims of\n\n44\n\nThe People v Shaw [1982] IR 1, per Kenny J.\n\nxl\n\nIntroduction\n\nfamily, community and nation left little space for the pursuit of feminist agendas. Gender was defined with reference to strict binary divisions between male and female roles. At a time of nation-building, any confusion of gender boundaries could stand only for the ‘fragile status of nationality’.45 Strictly defined gender divisions supported Ireland’s claim to a distinct cultural identity. Any questioning of those divisions, threatened to undermine Ireland’s claims. In more recent years, the Irish legal system has undergone a shift from ‘ethnos to demos’.46 The Supreme Court has rejected appeals to religious doctrine in adjudicating on questions of rights, pointing out that in a pluralist state, such appeals lack a democratic legitimacy. The constitutional amendments introduced following the Good Friday Agreement47 acknowledge the diversity of identities and traditions on the island of Ireland.48 This shift towards a heterogenous public sphere has allowed feminism to reclaim a public identity for women and to assert rights to equal citizenship that appeal, not to cultural traditions or beliefs, but to universal human rights norms. Changing family structures and the pluralisation of society has led to a backlash, however, from the Christian right. Human rights discourse, portrayed as asocial and individualistic, has been one of the main targets of the Christian right movement, which has rejected the expansion of human rights discourse into the domestic sphere, challenging, in particular, the claims to gender equality that impact upon the family, sexuality and reproductive health. The Irish government has, in recent years, distanced itself from the Christian right’s family values agenda, encouraging greater female participation in paid employment, feeding the appetite of the Celtic Tiger economy. Religious–cultural claims have, instead, been given greater rein within debates on reproductive health. Effectively the State has adopted a Rawlsian strategy, drawing lines between the political and the non-political, allowing comprehensive doctrines to flourish within the non-political sphere—defined so as to include reproductive rights. Conflicting claims that arise in the sphere of reproduction have proven difficult to regulate within a universalistic normative framework. These difficulties are largely due to a reluctance to recognise the plurality of voices that exists in matters relating to reproductive rights. As yet, the dominant political culture in Ireland\n\n45 D Kiberd, Inventing Ireland: The Literature of the Modern Ireland (London, Vintage, 1996) 406. 46 See: J Habermas, ‘Multiculturalism and the Liberal State’ (1995) 47(5) Stanford Law Review 849; J Habermas, Postnational Constellations: Political Essays (Cambridge, Polity Press, 2001). 47 Agreement reached in the Multi-Party Negotiations, 10 April 1998 (the Good Friday Agreement), reproduced at (1998) 37 ILM 751 (hereinafter referred to as the Good Friday Agreement). 48 See: The 19th Amendment to the Constitution Act, 1998.\n\nDiscourse Ethics, Feminism and the ‘Clash of Cultures’\n\nxli\n\nremains reluctant to move beyond the confines of orthodox Roman Catholic teaching on reproductive rights. Remaining rooted in a single comprehensive doctrine, of course, limits the possibilities of reform. It also limits the pursuit of a feminist agenda. In Ireland, much of feminist jurisprudence comes within the traditions of liberal legalism. Feminist lawyers, academics and practitioners, have sought to ‘add women in’, to seek equality and justice for women, using the tools of rights discourse.49 Much has been achieved by feminist movements in Ireland. Legislative reforms, often prompted by the requirements of EU membership, have eliminated discriminatory legislative provisions that sought to constrain the roles and opportunities provided to women. The limits of liberal legalism, however, are increasingly being recognized. Anti-discrimination law, in Ireland and the throughout the EU, has done little to tackle the broader structural aspects of gender inequality. Legislative measures to promote gender equality have focused primarily on the pursuit of market equality. Yet, despite guarantees of equal pay and equal treatment, gender remains a significant factor in poverty and social exclusion. Feminist lawyers in Ireland are increasingly questioning the limits imposed by legal liberalism and seeking, not only to add women in to existing laws and legal processes, but to engage in a normative reconstruction of the legal sphere.50 Discourse ethics, and a dualtrack approach to conflicting cultural claims, can assist in this process of reconstruction, appealing to universal norms while at the same time supporting immanent critiques within religious communities. A reluctance to accept difference within religious–cultural traditions can also be seen in constitutional debates in Pakistan, where gender equality is frequently subordinated to religious–cultural claims defining and limiting women’s status. As elsewhere, these claims have been given greater rein in domains labelled as private—the family and domestic sphere. Muslim personal law has been exempted from the requirement to comply with the guarantees of fundamental rights. This division between the public and the\n\n49 See, for example: A Connolly (ed), Gender and the Law in Ireland (Dublin, Oaktree Press, 1993). 50 See: L Connolly, The Irish Women’s Movement: From Revolution to Devolution (London, Palgrave, 2002); C Coulter, ‘“Hello Divorce, Good-bye Daddy”: Women, Gender and the Divorce Debate’ in A Bradley and MG Valiulis, (eds), Gender and Sexuality in Modern Ireland (Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 1997) 275; C Coulter, The Hidden Tradition: Feminism, Women and Nationalism (Cork, Cork University Press, 1993); R Fletcher, ‘Post-colonial Fragments: Representations of Abortion in Irish Law and Politics’ (2001) 28(4) Journal of Law and Society 568; S Mullally, ‘Promoting Gender Equality: Beyond the Limits of Non-discrimination’ in C Costello and E Barry, (eds), Equality in Diversity (Dublin, Irish Centre for European Law and the Equality Authority, 2003) 295; S Mullally, ‘Making Women Count in Ireland’ in S Nott and F Beveridge, (eds), Making Women Count: Integrating Gender into Law and Policy Making (London, Ashgate, 2000) (with M Donnelly and O Smith).\n\nxlii\n\nIntroduction\n\nprivate has also limited Pakistan’s participation in international human rights treaties. Pakistan’s ratification of CEDAW and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child51 (CRC) was accompanied by sweeping reservations appealing to Islam and to the requirements of domestic law. Feminist movements in Pakistan have adopted a range of strategies in attempting to pursue their claims. Drawing on insider methodologies, Farida Shahid, Shaheen Sardar-Ali and others, have highlighted egalitarian traditions within Islam.52 However, the prevailing patriarchal interpretations of Islam continue to constrain and limit the possibilities for reform. Feminist readings of Islam have been met with competing readings that deny equal recognition of women’s moral agency. Against this background, a transformation of the legal sphere is possible only through appeals to norms that can claim a universal legitimacy and that can support the reinterpretation of the Shari’ah proposed by Muslim feminists. Drawing on a comprehensive doctrine as a justificatory basis for human rights claims inevitably limits the possibilities of reform. Recognizing these limits, feminists in Pakistan have also called for a secular legal framework, rejecting the process of reinterpreting Islam adopted by Muslim feminists. Asma Jehangir, for example, has pointed to the need for a more heterogenous public sphere, one that can accommodate diverse religious beliefs within a framework of human rights.53 For some, however, this strategy seems to situate Islam in opposition to the pursuit of women’s human rights. In place of this oppositional approach, a dual-track approach, combining a universalistic framework with ongoing moral–political dialogue within Islam, would allow for a cultural mediation of universal norms. Insider methodologies, drawing on the support of a universalistic framework can generate the kind of consensus necessary for the effective implementation of human rights norms. To enable such a dialogue to take place, however, there first needs to be an uncoupling of orthodox Islam and the legal–political culture. Attempts at such an uncoupling can be seen in the field of Muslim personal law, where changes have been brought about drawing on the standards set by CEDAW and appeals to universal norms. The final chapter examines the conflicting claims that arise between feminism and the politics of multiculturalism, focusing on debates in India. Feminist movements in India have struggled for many years to negotiate the layers of cultural identity that define the boundaries of women’s human\n\n51 Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted 20 November 1989, entered into force 2 September 1990, GA Res 44/25, 44 UN GAOR, Supp (No 49), UN Doc A/44/49 (1989) 166. 52 See generally: F Shahid, et al, (eds), Shaping Women’s Lives: Laws, Practices and Strategies in Pakistan (Lahore, Shirkitgah, 1998); SS Ali, Gender and Human Rights in Islam and International Law (The Hague, Kluwer, 2000). 53 See: A Jahangir and H Jilani, The Hudood Ordinances: A Divine Sanction?

Although India’s constitutional text directs the Government to develop a uniform civil code,54 communal tensions and the claims of religious groups have hindered this process and, with it, the extension of human rights discourse into the domestic sphere. The accommodation of religious–cultural differences has led to a highly gendered division between the public and the private, one that allows comprehensive doctrines to flourish within spheres that are defined as ‘non-political’. An overlapping consensus supporting family law reform has proven elusive as non-interference in the patriarchal norms of religious communities becomes the requirement of a politics of recognition. Debates in India following on from the Shah Bano case highlight the extent to which gender equality may be compromised by yielding to the dominant voices within a particular religion or cultural tradition.55 As the Supreme Court noted in Danial Latifi and Anr v Union of India,56 the pursuit of gender justice raises questions of a universal magnitude. Responding to those questions requires an appeal to norms that claim a universal legitimacy. Liberal feminist demands for a uniform civil code, however, have pitted the women’s movement against proponents of minority rights and claims for greater autonomy for minority groups. Against the background of growing communal tensions and increasing Hinduisation of politics, the women’s movement has recognised the need for more complex strategies— strategies that encompass the diversity of women’s lives and create a sense of belonging amongst women with diverse religious–cultural affiliations. Liberal theories of rights that abstract from the concrete realities of women’s daily lives have not always addressed the institutions and procedures necessary to build that sense of belonging. This is where the insights of discourse ethics theorists can assist us. Deliberative models of democracy developed by discourse ethics theorists recognise the need for ‘differencesensitive’ processes of inclusion. Such processes include group-specific rights, guarantees of cultural autonomy, compensatory programmes and other arrangements designed to protect the rights of minorities to a limited form of self-determination. Adopting such measures can also lead to difficulties, however. Groupspecific rights bring about further fragmentation and conflict. This is the so-called ‘Balkanisation’ phenomenon. Rather than creating a vibrant multicultural society, group-differentiated citizenship can lead to ‘a multiplicity of subcultures closed off from one another.’57 While this may satisfy\n\n54\n\nSee: Art 45 of the Directive Principles of State Policy, Constitution on India.

Where groups are closed off from one another, the possibility of supporting internal struggles of resistance becomes ever more limited. Group-specific rights do not necessarily guarantee internal self-determination and, as we shall see, women within minority groups are frequently subjected to internal restrictions. A dual-track approach recognises both the need for an expanded moral and political dialogue around issues of human rights and a cosmopolitan law that protects internal self-determination for individual group members. However, if a cosmopolitan law is to gain legitimacy amongst diverse cultural groups, it must be divorced from any one comprehensive conception of the good. The majority culture cannot dictate the parameters of political discourse, or define the general political culture in which all groups are to share equally. This painful process of uncoupling, however, should not tear a society apart. The cosmopolitan law, and the institutions and processes of a deliberative democracy, must also be sufficiently inclusive to avoid fragmentation and conflict. This is the challenge faced by the women’s movement in India and by feminist movements in any multicultural society. In focusing on post-colonial states, we also see the alliances that have developed between feminism and postmodernism, and the problems that these alliances can bring. Postcolonial theory shares with anti-essentialist feminism an aversion to universalist moral theories and a concern with the local, the particular. Spivak is categorical in her condemnation of the universal: ‘there can be’, she says, ‘no universalist claims in the human sciences’.58 Bhabha notes that all the major categories of postcolonial theory, hybridity, border-crossing, indeterminacy, ambivalence, ‘refuse every boundary as a matter of principle.’59 This is problematic for feminism. It raises, yet again, the difficulty of specifying the limits of reasonable pluralism, leaving feminism vulnerable to communitarian claims and the illiberal demands of inherited traditions. Discourse ethics offers much to assist in a normative reconstruction of human rights theory and practice. The anti-universalist critique of human rights discourse is justifiably critical of the received traditions of human rights law. Missing within this critique, however, is a failure to recognise the ‘detective aspect’60 of human rights discourse and the transformative potential of a truly universal discourse. Human rights discourse guarantees a hearing to each individual voice. Thus, it provides the means to expose its\n\n58 GC Spivak, Foundations and Cultural Studies: Questioning Foundations: Truth/Subjectivity/Culture (London, Routledge, 1993) 153. 59 HK Bhabha, The Location of Culture (London, Routledge, 1994) 170. 60 See: L Wingert, Türöffner zu geschlossenen Gesellschaften (Frankfurter, Rundschau, 1995), cited in J Habermas, above n 17, p 120.\n\nDiscourse Ethics, Feminism and the ‘Clash of Cultures’\n\nxlv\n\nown failures and shortcomings.61 At the same time as demanding the inclusion of the other, it functions as a sensor for exclusionary practices exercised in its name. This ‘detective aspect’ is more likely to function where the right to democratic participation is guaranteed. As Habermas, Benhabib and others have argued, human rights are internally linked to democracy. This book argues that this internal relation, if fully realized, could address the criticisms raised by difference feminisms and assist in negotiating the many conflicting cultural claims that limit the pursuit of a global feminist agenda.\n\n61\n\nJ Habermas, above n 17, p 120.\n\n1 The Discourse of Human Rights: ‘An Active Enemy of Women’s Progress’1? ... just as women have begun to become human, even as we have begun to transform the human so it is something more worth having and might apply to us, we are told by high theory that the human is inherently authoritarian, not worth having, untransformable, and may not even exist—and how hopelessly 19th century of us to want it.2\n\nM\n\nUCH OF FEMINIST legal theory falls within the liberal paradigm. In recent years, however, feminism has taken a relational turn, emphasising the location of the human self in networks of relationships and the importance of values of solidarity and connection. This chapter examines three main strands within feminist theory: feminist Ethics of Care,3 Catharine MacKinnon’s radical feminism and finally postmodern feminisms. Each strand shares a common concern with difference, difference between women and men and difference between women themselves. Within each strand of feminist theory, we find possibilities for a normative reconstruction of human rights theory and practice. Ultimately, however, this process of reconstruction must continue to appeal to universal norms and principles, if feminism is to retain its critical, emancipatory edge.\n\n1\n\nSee: M Nussbaum, Sex and Social Justice (Oxford, OUP, 1999) 56. C MacKinnon, ‘Symposium on Unfinished Feminist Business: Some Points Against Postmodernism’ (2000) 75 Chicago-Kent Law Review 687, 711. 3 I will focus primarily on Carol Gilligan’s work. The feminist ethics of care has been explored and developed in the work of many feminist thinkers. See: M Fineman, The Autonomy Myth: A Theory of Dependency (New York, NY, New Press, 2003); M Fineman, ‘Contract and Care’ (2001) 76(1) Chicago-Kent Law Review 1403; E Kittay, Love’s Labor: Essays on Women, Equality, and Dependency (New York, NY, Routledge, 1999); M Fineman and DT Meyers, (eds), Women and Moral Theory (Totowa, NJ, Rowman & Littlefield, 1987); N Noddings, Caring, A Feminine Approach To Ethics and Moral Education (Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, 1984). 2\n\n2 Discourse of Human Rights: An Enemy of Women’s Progress A. FEMINIST ETHICS OF CARE\n\nAlthough Carol Gilligan’s claim to have discovered a distinctively female mode of moral reasoning is no longer widely accepted, her work continues to raise an important challenge to the theory and practice of human rights. For feminism, the fundamental question raised by Gilligan still remains. Can an Ethic of Care better serve the interests of feminism than an Ethic of Justice and rights? The salience of appeals to community in contemporary political theory reflects an ethical turn, a nostalgia for questions of the moral, the good, the virtuous.4 It is a turn that owes much to Carol Gilligan’s studies of moral development and her feminist Ethics of Care.5 Gilligan puts forward her proposals for an Ethic of Care in her book, In a Different Voice. She argues that there are two moral codes, a feminine one based on caring and the maintenance of relationships and networks, the Ethic of Care, and a masculine one based on a more abstract systemisation of rights and rules, the Ethic of Justice. At stake between these two codes are differences in: (a) moral capacities—learning moral principles (justice) versus developing moral dispositions (care); (b) moral reasoning—solving problems by seeking principles that have universal applicability (justice) versus seeking responses that are appropriate to the particular case (care) and; (c) moral concepts—attending to rights and fairness (justice) versus attending to responsibilities and relationships (care).6 Gilligan also argues that two competing visions of the human self underlie these distinct moral codes. She claims that the prevailing values of justice and autonomy imply a view of the individual as separate and of relationships as either hierarchical or contractual. In contrast, she says, the values of care and connection, salient in women’s thinking, imply a view of the self and the other as interdependent and of relationships as networks, created and sustained by attention and responsibility.7 By recovering ‘the lost Ethic of Care’, Gilligan seeks to change the dominant image of the human self and to correct ‘an individualism’ within moral theory that has been centred within a ‘single interpretive framework.’8 Rights discourse, she argues, is part of that framework having developed in response to a limited set of questions. These questions, she\n\n4 See generally, N Lacey, Unspeakable Subjects: Feminist Essays in Legal and Social Theory (Oxford, Hart Publishing, 1998). 5 C Gilligan, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women’s Development (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1982). 6 W Kymlicka, Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1990) 265. 7 C Gilligan, ‘Remapping the Moral Domain: New Images of the Self in Relationship’ in TC Heller, M Sosna and DE Wellbery, (eds), Reconstructing Individualism: Autonomy, Individuality, and the Self in Western Thought (Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press, 1986) 237, 242. 8 Ibid, p 239.\n\nFeminist Ethics of Care\n\n3\n\nparaphrases as: ‘What are the circumstances in which essentially solitary individuals might agree to come together in civil society, what would justify them in doing so and how might conflict be prevented when they do?’9. Gilligan argues that this limited and partial view of human interaction has defined the scope of ethics of justice and rights. Human interdependence is presumed to be optional. The facts of human biology, in particular, reproductive biology are ignored. The role of carers who spend their daily lives not in avoiding conflicts with ‘strangers’, but in caring for dependent others is also ignored. Alison Jaggar points out that the assumption of innate human selfishness and competitiveness, ‘overlooks the fact that millions of people (most of them women) have spent millions of hours for hundreds of years giving their utmost to millions of others.’10 And, of course, the long overlooked ‘moral proletariat’ is mostly women.11 As Fineman notes, the ‘assumed family’ presumes that caretakers take on the responsibility of caring for dependent others, with little or no recognition or accommodation for caring work, either by the market-place or the State.12 If theoretical account were taken of these facts, the liberal problematic would be transformed and egoism, competitiveness and conflict would themselves become puzzling and problematic.13 In place of the ‘isolated, atomistic’ self associated with liberal individualism, Gilligan presents a relational view of the self and a dialogic view of identity formation, which, she says, can be arrived at by paying closer attention to the experience of women. For women, Gilligan claims, ‘the self is known through the experience of connection, defined not by reflection but by interaction, the responsiveness of human engagement.’14 This relational view of the self is reflected in the Ethic of Care. Gilligan’s relational view of the self is an attractive one. Her thesis, linking empirical claims about psychological modes of development to proposals for a feminist Ethic of Care, is a powerful one. However, Gilligan’s claim to have discovered a distinctively ‘feminine’ mode of moral reasoning has attracted much criticism. Her thesis repeats many of Western political philosophy’s attempts to distinguish the intuitive, emotional dispositions said to be required for women’s domestic life from the rational, impartial and\n\n9 AM Jaggar, Feminist Politics and Human Nature (Totowa, NJ, Rowman & Allanheld, 1983) 40. 11 A Baier, ‘The Need for More than Justice’ in V Held, Justice and Care: Essential Readings in Feminist Ethics (Boulder, CO, Westview Press, 1995) 47, 49–50. 12 See: M Fineman, ‘Cracking the Foundational Myths: Independence, Autonomy, and Selfsufficiency’ (2000) 8 American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy and the Law 13, and ibid, 2003, above n 3. 13 Ibid. 14 C Gilligan, 1986, above n 7, p 241.\n\n4 Discourse of Human Rights: An Enemy of Women’s Progress dispassionate thought said to be required for men’s public life. Feminism has devoted a great deal of energy to repudiating these claims. Many feminists disagree with the claim that different modes of moral reasoning correlate with gender divisions. To the extent that correlations can be found, disagreement has arisen as to why such differences exist. Powerless groups often learn empathy because they are dependent on others for protection. As Susan Okin argues, women, as subordinates in a male-dominated society, have to develop psychological characteristics that please the dominant groups and fulfil its needs.15 Women are brought up from the very earliest years in the belief that their ideal of character is the very opposite to that of men: ‘not self-will, and government by self-control, but submission, and yielding to the control of others.’16 Women and oppressed classes or minority groups are often associated with an Ethic of Care precisely because of the constraints imposed upon them by dominant groups.17 This argument is put strongly by Catharine MacKinnon. She argues that any special ability women may have for caring and connection can be attributed to the negative aspects of subordination. Women value care, she says, ‘because men have valued us according to the care we give them.’18 Affirming women’s differences perpetuates the belief that those attributes traditionally associated with women really are women’s—rather than simply those that have been attributed to women.19 1. Reason versus Sentiment Other difficulties arise with the feminist Ethic of Care. Care theorists emphasise the role of sentiment and emotion in moral reasoning. Without a well-developed moral disposition, they argue, we cannot know what the principles of justice require of us when faced with concrete moral problems. Moral duties cannot be fulfilled by ‘cold unfeeling moral agent[s].’20 Quoting Hume, Annette Baier argues that the ‘cold jealous virtue of justice’ may yet prove to be too cold.21 Respect for rights, she says, is quite compatible with a great deal of human misery and suffering. This argument is taken up by 15 SM Okin, ‘Thinking Like a Woman’ in D Rhode, (ed), Theoretical Perspectives on Sexual Difference (New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 1990) 145, 154. 16 JS Mill, ‘On the Subjection of Women’ (1869) in SM Okin, (ed), (Indianapolis, IN, Hackett, 1988) 15. 17 S Harding, ‘The Curious Coincidence of Feminine and African Moralities: Challenges for Feminist Theory’ in E Kittay and D Meyers, (eds), Women and Moral Theory (Savage, MN, Rowman & Littlefield, 1987) 296, 307. 18 CA MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified Discourses on Life and Law (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1987) 39. 19 Ibid. 20 CH Sommers, ‘Filial Morality’ in E Kittay and D Meyers, (eds), Women and Moral Theory (Savage, MD, Rowman and Littlefield, 1987) 69, 78. 21 A Baier, 1995, above n 11, p 51.\n\nFeminist Ethics of Care\n\n5\n\nRichard Rorty. Rorty frequently invokes the work of Care theorists such as Annette Baier to support his arguments for a ‘liberalism without foundations’. In his essay, ‘Human rights, rationality and sentimentality’, Rorty argues that we need to overcome our suspicion that sentiment is too weak a force for moral reasoning.22 He points to the emergence of a human rights culture which, he says, seems to owe nothing to increased moral knowledge and everything to hearing sad and sentimental stories—to what Annette Baier refers to as a ‘progress of sentiments’. But could or should this ‘progress of sentiments’ replace appeals to rights-based moral principles? Sad and sentimental stories are not enough. We have to move beyond those stories, to attempt an explanation and to identify possible responses to a problem. This requires an appeal to principles, the recognition of a duty to respond.
