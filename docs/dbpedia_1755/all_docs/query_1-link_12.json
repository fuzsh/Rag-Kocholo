        "text": "Cases\n\nEDITORIAL BOARD OF PRAVOYE DELO AND SHTEKEL v. UKRAINE\n\n[2011] ECHR 748 (2014) 58 EHRR 28, [2011] ECHR 748, 58 EHRR 28THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant is the editorial board of Pravoe Delo, a newspaper officially registered in Odessa in May 2000. The second applicant is the editor-in-chief of Pravoe Delo. He lives in Odessa.\n\nAt the material time Pravoe Delo was a local newspaper published three times a week with a circulation of 3,000 copies. It published reports and material on political and social matters in Ukraineand, in particular, the Odessa Region. Due to lack of funds, the newspaper often reprinted articles and other material obtained from various public sources, including the Internet.\n\nOn 19 September 2003 Pravoe Delo published an anonymous letter allegedly written by an employee of the Security Service of Ukraine, which the second applicant’s colleague, Ms I., had downloaded from a news website. The letter contained allegations that senior officials of the Odessa Regional Department of the Security Service had been engaging in unlawful and corrupt activities, and in particular that they had connections with members of organised criminal groups. One of the paragraphs of the letter read as follows:\n\n“… The Deputy Head of [the Odessa Regional Department of the Security Service] [I. T.], a close friend and assistant of the Head of the Department P., established ‘business’ contacts with [the organised criminal group] of [A. A.] … A member of [the organised criminal group G. T.], an agent of [A. A.], who is in charge of the main areas of activities of the gang: [he is] a coordinator and sponsor of murders, [he] meets with [I. T.] and resolves financial issues for the top officials of the Department of [the Security Service] in the Odessa Region …”\n\nThe letter was followed by these comments, prepared by Ms I. on behalf of the editorial board:\n\n“When publishing this letter without the knowledge and consent of the editor-in chief, I understand that I may not only face trouble … but I may also create problems for the newspaper. Because, if this letter is [misinformation], then [the media], in which it appears may be endangered. On the other hand, if this letter is genuine, then its author faces a higher risk. Besides, given that this anonimka [anonymous letter] has already been published on the Odessa website Vlasti.net (to which we refer, in accordance with their requirement), we have the blessing of God [to publish it]. We are proceeding on the understanding that, in accordance with the Act on democratic civil control over the military organisation and law-enforcement organs of the State, we are carrying out civil control and, pursuant to section 29 of the Act, we would like to receive open information concerning the facts described in this letter from the relevant authorities. Moreover, [it is to be noted] that the Department of [the Security Service] in the Odessa Region did not react to an analogous publication in the Top Secret [newspaper] … I remind [you] that the [Pravoe Delo] newspaper … is widely open for letters in reply and comments from all interested agencies.”\n\nIn October 2003 G. T., who at the time lived in Odessa and was the President of the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation, lodged a defamation claim with the Prymorskyy District Court of Odessa against the applicants. G. T. alleged that the information in the Pravoe Delo issue of 19 September 2003 concerned him, that it was untrue and had damaged his dignity and reputation. He asked the court to order the applicants to publish a retraction and an apology and to pay him compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 200,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH)1.\n\nThe applicants first argued before the court that they were not responsible for the accuracy of the information contained in the material that they had published, as they had reproduced material published elsewhere without any modifications. The publication contained a reference to the source of the material and was followed by comments explaining the editors’ position regarding the material and inviting comments from the persons and bodies concerned. The applicants also submitted that, if the court were to award G. T. the amount of compensation he had claimed, the newspaper would become insolvent and would have to close.\n\nSubsequently, at a hearing on 24 April 2004, the second applicant stated that the article was not about the claimant and that its wording did not necessarily establish that it was a particular “G. T.” who was being referred to.\n\nOn 7 May 2004 the court ruled against the applicants. It found that the information at issue did concern the claimant, who was a public figure involved in public activities in the Odessa Region and had represented Ukraine at sports events abroad in his capacity as the President of the Ukraine National Thai Boxing Federation. In that context, the court noted that this had not been contested by the applicants in their initial submissions and that the publication was about the activities of the Security Service in the Odessa Region. The court further held that the content was defamatory and that the applicants had failed to prove that it was truthful. It found no grounds to release the applicants from civil liability under section 42 of the Press Act, as the internet site to which the applicants referred was not printed media registered pursuant to section 32 of the Press Act.\n\nThe court ordered the first applicant to publish a retraction of the following content of the publication:\n\n“… A member of [the organised criminal group G. T.], an agent of [A. A.], who is in charge of the main areas of activities of the gang: [he is] a coordinator and sponsor of murders, [he] meets with [I. T.] and resolves financial issues for the top officials of the Department of [the Security Service] in the Odessa Region …”\n\nThe court further ordered the second applicant to publish an official apology in the newspaper.\n\nIn determining the amount of compensation to be paid to the claimant, the court considered the submissions of the latter and the information concerning the financial situation of the newspaper. It noted that its gross annual income was about UAH 22,0002 and found it reasonable to order the applicants jointly to pay G. T. UAH 15,0003 for non pecuniary damage. The applicants were also ordered to pay to the State Budget UAH 7501 in court fees.\n\nThe applicants appealed. They maintained the submissions they had made before the first-instance court and also contended that the editorial board had not been registered as a legal entity pursuant to the relevant regulations on registration of the media and that the second applicant had not been appointed as editor-in-chief in accordance with the law. Thus, in their view, they could not take part in the proceedings.\n\nThe applicants further argued that invoking their civil liability was contrary to section 41 of the Press Act and section 17 of the Act on the State support of mass media and social protection of journalists, stating that they had not intended to defame G. T. and that, by publishing the material, they had wished to promote public discussion of the issues raised in that material which were of the high public interest. According to them, it was their duty to disseminate the material and the public had the right to receive it.\n\nThe second applicant also submitted that he had not authorised the publication of the material at issue and that the legislation did not provide for an obligation to apologise as a sanction for defamation.\n\nOn 14 September 2004 and 24 February 2005, respectively, the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court rejected the applicants’ appeals and upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nOn 3 July 2006 the applicants and G. T. concluded a friendly-settlement agreement, pursuant to which the latter waived any claim in respect of the amount of compensation under the judgment of 7 May 2004. The applicants, on their part, undertook to cover all the costs and expenses relating to the court proceedings and to publish in Pravoe Delo promotional and informational materials at G. T.’s request, the volume of which was limited to the amount of compensation under the judgment.\n\nIn 2008 the applicants discontinued publishing Pravoe Delo.\n\nII. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n\nA. Constitution of Ukraine of 28 June 1996\n\nRelevant extracts from the Constitution read as follows:\n\nArticle 32\n\n“… Everyone is guaranteed judicial protection of the right to rectify incorrect information about himself or herself and members of his or her family, and of the right to demand that any type of information be rectified, and also the right to compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage inflicted by the collection, storage, use and dissemination of such incorrect information.”\n\nArticle 34\n\n“Everyone is guaranteed the right to freedom of thought and speech, and to the free expression of his or her views and beliefs.\n\nEveryone has the right to freely collect, store, use and disseminate information by oral, written or other means of his or her choice.\n\nThe exercise of these rights may be restricted by law in the interests of national security, territorial indivisibility or public order, with the purpose of preventing disturbances or crime, protecting the health of the population, the reputation or rights of other persons, preventing the publication of information received confidentially, or maintaining the authority and impartiality of justice.”\n\nB.

A physical person whose non-pecuniary rights have been infringed as a result of dissemination of untrue information about him or her and (or) members of his or her family, shall have the right to reply, and [the right to] the retraction of that information.\n\n…\n\n3. Negative information disseminated about a person shall be considered untrue if the person who disseminated it does not prove the contrary.\n\n4. Untrue information shall be retracted by the person who disseminated the information …\n\n5. If the untrue information is contained in a document which has been accepted (issued) by a legal entity, that document shall be recalled.\n\n6. A physical person whose non-pecuniary rights have been infringed in printed or other mass media shall have the right to reply, and also [the right to] the retraction of the untrue information in the same mass media, in the manner envisaged by law…\n\nUntrue information shall be retracted irrespective of the guilt of the person who disseminated it.\n\n7. Untrue information shall be retracted in the same manner as it was disseminated.”\n\nD. Information Act of 2 October1992\n\nRelevant extracts from the Information Act provided, as worded at the material time, as follows:\n\nSection 20. Mass media\n\n“Printed mass media are periodical prints (press) – newspapers, magazines, bulletins – and occasional prints with a set circulation.\n\nAudiovisual mass media are radio, television, cinema, audio, video records and so on.\n\nThe procedure of establishing … of particular media shall be determined by the laws concerning such media.”\n\nSection 47.

The court shall take into account the outcome of the use by the claimant of extrajudicial, in particular pre-trial opportunities for retraction of untrue material, defending of his honour and dignity and reputation, and settlement of the entire dispute. Having regard to the circumstances, the court may refuse compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\nThe intention of the journalist and/or official of the media means his or their stance in regard to dissemination of information when the journalist and/or official of the media are aware of the untruthfulness of the information and have anticipated its socially injurious consequences.\n\nThe journalist and/or the mass media shall be released from liability for dissemination of the information that does not correspond to reality if the court establishes that the journalist acted in good faith and checked the information.”\n\nG. Resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court of Ukraine of 27 February 2009 on judicial practice in cases concerning the protection of the honour and dignity of a physical person, and of the reputation of a physical person and legal entity\n\nThe relevant extracts from the Resolution of the Plenary Supreme Court read as follows:\n\n“26. According to Article 19 of the Constitution of Ukraine legal order in Ukraine is based on [the principle] according to which no one shall be forced to do what is not envisaged by the legislation. In its turn, Article 34 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of Ukraine guarantees everyone the right to freedom of thought and speech, and to the free expression of his or her views and beliefs.\n\nA court has no power to oblige a respondent to apologise to a claimant … as forced apology is not envisaged by Articles 16 [and] 277 [of the Civil Code of 2003] as a means of judicial protection of honour, dignity, [and] business reputation [in case of] dissemination of untrue information.”\n\nH. Judicial practice of the Supreme Court in cases concerning the application of Articles 16 and 277 of the Civil Code of 2003\n\nThe Supreme Court confirmed the Plenum’s approach in a defamation case, having quashed the lower courts’ decisions by which a respondent was ordered, inter alia, to apologise as not based on law. In particular, the relevant extract of the Supreme Court’s judgment (dated 17 June 2009) reads as follows:\n\n“…\n\nThe court[s] are not entitled to oblige a respondent to apologise to a claimant in one or another form, as Articles 16 [and] 277 [of the Civil Code of 2003] do not provide for forced apology as a means of judicial protection of honour, dignity, [and] business reputation [in case of] dissemination of untrue information; compulsion of a person to change his/her beliefs is an interference with the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine and Article 10 of the Convention…”\n\nII. Relevant COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND international material\n\nA. Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)16 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on measures to promote the public service value of the Internet\n\nAt their 1010th meeting on 7 November 2007 the Ministers’ Deputies considered essential aspects of the use of new information and communication technologies and services, in particular the Internet, in the context of protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They acknowledged the increasingly important role the Internet was playing in providing diverse sources of information to the public and the people’s significant reliance on the Internet as a tool for communication.\n\nIt was noted however that the Internet could, on the one hand, significantly enhance the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to freedom of expression, while, on the other hand, the Internet might adversely affect other rights, freedoms and values, such as the respect for private life and secrecy of correspondence and for the dignity of human beings.\n\nThe Ministers’ Deputies adopted recommendations to the Council of Europe’s member States with regard to the governance of the Internet. These included recommendation to elaborate a clear legal framework delineating the boundaries of the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in the field of new information and communication technologies and to encourage the private sector to develop open and transparent self- and co-regulation on the basis of which key actors in this field could be held accountable.\n\nB. Joint Declaration by the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, adopted on 21 December 2005\n\nThe growing importance of the Internet as a vehicle for facilitating in practice the free flow of information and ideas was also recognised in the Joint Declaration issued by Mr A. Ligabo, Mr M. Haraszti, and Mr E. Bertoni. They stressed the need for strict application of international guarantees of freedom of expression to the Internet. In the context, it was stated that no one should be liable for content on the Internet of which they were not the author, unless they had either adopted that content as their own or refused to obey a court order to remove that content.\n\nTHE LAW\n\nI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n\nThe applicants complained that their right to freedom of expression had been violated in that the courts had allowed G. T.’s claim concerning the content published in Pravoe Delo on 19 September 2003. They stated that the interference had neither been in accordance with the law nor necessary in a democratic society. The applicants relied on Article 10 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”\n\nA. Admissibility\n\nThe Government submitted that the applicants could not claim to be victims of a violation of Article 10 of the Convention, as the interference with their right to freedom of expression had been based on the decisions of the domestic courts. The applicants did not complain under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the impugned court proceedings had been unfair, there had been no irregularities in these proceedings, and the Court had limited jurisdiction regarding the assessment of facts and the application of law by domestic courts. On these grounds, they invited the Court to declare the application incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention.\n\nThe applicants disagreed.\n\nThe Court considers that the Government’s objection is closely linked to the substance of the applicants’ complaints under Article 10 of the Convention and that it must therefore be joined to the merits.\n\nThe Court further notes that the application is not manifestly ill founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n\nB. Merits\n\n1. Submissions of the parties\n\n(a) The applicants\n\nThe applicants argued that the domestic legislation concerning the liability of the press for defamation lacked clarity and foreseeability and that the domestic courts had disregarded the relevant legislative guarantees against punishment for unverified statements made by journalists. They submitted that the courts had not taken into account the fact that they had not disseminated information about G. T., that the second applicant had not given his permission for the publication of the material, that they had sufficiently distanced themselves from the publication, and that G. T. had not used the opportunity of asking the editorial board for a retraction before bringing his defamation claim before the courts.\n\nThe second applicant also contended that Ukrainian law did not provide for an obligation to apologise as a sanction for defamation.\n\nThe applicants further submitted that they had disseminated the material, which had already been published on the Internet, with a view to promoting further discussion of the important political issues raised in the material. They stated that the amount of compensation which they had been required to pay had been too high given the annual income of the newspaper, and had placed a disproportionate burden on them. In this context, they stated that they had had to discontinue publishing Pravoe Delo.\n\n(b) The Government\n\nThe Government submitted that the interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of expression had been lawful in that it had been based on the clear, accessible and foreseeable provisions of the domestic law, namely, on Article 7 of the Civil Code of 1963, section 47 of the Information Act of 2 October 1992, and sections 1, 32 and 42 of the Printed Mass Media (Press) Act of 16 November 1992, as applied by the national courts in the applicants’ case.\n\nThe Government further submitted that the interference had been aimed at protecting the honour, dignity and business reputation of a private person, whose rights had been prejudiced by the publication at issue. According to them, this had been a legitimate aim within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, which the applicants did not deny.\n\nThe Government argued that the publication had contained serious factual allegations directed against a prominent public figure who had contributed to the development of sports in Ukraine. The applicants had failed to prove these allegations. The fact that they had reproduced the material obtained from a website had not been sufficient to release them from such an obligation, as the legal status of information derived from the Internet had not been determined under the domestic law. Therefore, the Government stated that the interference had been necessary in the present case.\n\nThey also submitted that the applicants had not actually been required to pay the compensation awarded by the courts to the claimant, as they had settled the matter at the stage of enforcement of the judgment of 7 May 2004. According to the Government, it had not been proved by the applicants that they had discontinued publishing their newspaper because of the interference at issue.\n\nRelying on the Court’s decision as to the admissibility of Vitrenko and Others v. Ukraine ((dec.), no. 23510/02, 16 December 2008), the Government contended that the court’s order to apologise had not been contrary to the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn the above grounds, the Government stated that the impugned interference had not been disproportionate.\n\n2. The Court’s assessment\n\n(a) Whether there was an interference with the right to freedom of expression\n\nThe Court observes that the publication at issue involved defamatory statements of fact. According to the findings of the civil courts, it was stated that a public figure, the President of the UkraineNational Thai Boxing Federation, was a member of an organised criminal group and “a coordinator and sponsor of murders”. The applicants had failed to show that those statements were true and the courts ordered them to publish a retraction and apology and to compensate the person concerned for the non pecuniary damage caused by the publication.\n\nThe Court considers that the courts’ decisions constituted an interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of expression.\n\nThe Court reiterates that its task in exercising its supervisory function under Article 10 of the Convention is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and, in particular, to determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 45, ECHR 1999-I). This inevitably entails a review of the decisions taken by the courts at the domestic level, irrespective of whether any complaints have been raised concerning the courts’ compliance with the procedural guarantees under Article 6 of the Convention. Therefore, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection as to the applicants’ victim status.\n\nThe Court will now examine whether the interference was justified under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.\n\n(b) Whether the interference was prescribed by law\n\nThe Court notes that the first and most important requirement of Article 10 of the Convention is that any interference by a public authority with the exercise of the freedom of expression should be lawful: the first sentence of the second paragraph essentially envisages that any restriction on expression must be “prescribed by law”. In order to comply with this requirement, interference does not merely have to have a basis in domestic law. The law itself must correspond to certain requirements of “quality”. In particular, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 XI).\n\nThe degree of precision depends to a considerable extent on the content of the instrument at issue, the field it is designed to cover, and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland, 28 March 1990, § 68, Series A no. 173). The notion of foreseeability applies not only to a course of conduct, of which an applicant should be reasonably able to foresee the consequences, but also to “formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties”, which may be attached to such conduct, if found to be in breach of the national laws (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 140, ECHR 2008 …).\n\nTurning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the applicants’ submissions regarding the question of the lawfulness of the interference essentially concern two specific issues, namely, the alleged lack of clarity and foreseeability of the relevant legislative provisions concerning journalists’ specific safeguards and the alleged absence of legal grounds for an obligation to apologise in cases of defamation.\n\n(i) Measures envisaged by Ukrainian law in cases of defamation\n\nAs regards the latter issue, the Court observes that Ukrainian law provides that, in cases of defamation, injured parties are entitled to demand a retraction of untrue and defamatory statements and compensation for damage. Both measures were applied in the applicants’ case. However, in addition to those measures, the courts ordered the second applicant to publish an official apology in the newspaper. The Court observes that such a measure was not specifically provided for in the domestic law.\n\nThe Court has already dealt with a similar situation in a case against Russia. In that case it was prepared to accept that the interpretation by the domestic courts of the notions of retraction or rectification under the relevant legislation as possibly including an apology was not such as to render the impugned interference unlawful within the meaning of the Convention (see Kazakov v. Russia, no. 1758/02, § 24, 18 December 2008).\n\nHowever, in contrast to the latter case, the present case contains no evidence or, at the least, a persuasive argument that Ukrainian courts were inclined to give such a broad interpretation to the legal provisions concerning the measures applicable in cases of defamation or that that was their general approach in such cases.\n\nThe Court further observes that, despite the second applicant’s specific and pertinent complaints in that connection, the domestic courts failed to give any explanation for the obvious departure from the relevant domestic rules (see paragraph 17 above). The Government’s submissions in that regard did not clarify the issue either.\n\nAs it appears from the relevant domestic judicial practice, though subsequent to the events at issue, imposition of an obligation to apologize in defamation cases may run counter the Constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression (see paragraphs 27-28 above).\n\nIn these circumstances, the Court finds that the court’s order to the second applicant to apologise was not prescribed by law and that accordingly there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention in that respect.\n\n(ii) Journalists’ specific safeguards in Ukrainian law\n\nThe Court observes that the publication at issue was a verbatim reproduction of material downloaded from a publicly accessible internet newspaper. It contained a reference to the source of the material and comments by the editorial board, in which they formally distanced themselves from the content of the material.\n\nUkrainian law, specifically the Press Act, grants journalists immunity from civil liability for verbatim reproduction of material published in the press (see paragraph 25 above). The Court notes that this provision generally conforms to its approach to journalists’ freedom to disseminate statements made by others (see, for instance, Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 35, Series A no. 298; and Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 62, ECHR 2001 III).\n\nHowever, according to the domestic courts, no such immunity existed for journalists reproducing material from internet sources not registered pursuant to the Press Act. In this connection, the Court observes that there existed no domestic regulations on State registration of internet media and that, according to the Government, the Press Act and other normative acts regulating media relations in Ukraine did not contain any provisions on the status of internet-based media or the use of information obtained from the Internet.\n\nIt is true that the Internet is an information and communication tool particularly distinct from the printed media, in particular as regards the capacity to store and transmit information. The electronic network serving billions of users worldwide is not and potentially cannot be subject to the same regulations and control. The risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press. Therefore, the policies governing reproduction of material from the printed media and the Internet may differ. The latter undeniably have to be adjusted according to the technology’s specific features in order to secure the protection and promotion of the rights and freedoms concerned.\n\nNevertheless, having regard to the role the Internet plays in the context of professional media activities (see paragraphs 29-32 above) and its importance for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression generally (see Times Newspapers Ltd v. United Kingdom (nos. 1 and 2), no. 3002/03 and 23676/03, § 27, 10 March 2009), the Court considers that the absence of a sufficient legal framework at the domestic level allowing journalists to use information obtained from the Internet without fear of incurring sanctions seriously hinders the exercise of the vital function of the press as a “public watchdog” (see, mutatis mutandis, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 59, Series A no. 216). In the Court’s view, the complete exclusion of such information from the field of application of the legislative guarantees for journalists’ freedom may itself give rise to an unjustified interference with press freedom under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nThe Court further observes that under Ukrainian law journalists may not be required to pay compensation in defamation cases if they did not disseminate the untrue information intentionally, acted in good faith and made checks on such information, or if the injured party failed to use the available possibilities to settle the dispute before going to court (see paragraph 26 above). In the domestic proceedings, the applicants explicitly raised the defence of qualified privilege under the latter provision. In particular, they argued that they had no malicious intent to defame the claimant by the publication of the material in question and that the public had an interest in receiving the information. Furthermore, they argued, that by reproducing the material previously published on the Internet, their intention was to promote debate and discussion on political matters of important public interest. They also argued that the claimant had not taken any steps to settle the dispute with the applicants despite the fact that in the same publication they had invited any person concerned to comment on it. However, their plea was entirely ignored by the courts.\n\nTherefore, the Court finds that, given the lack of adequate safeguards in the domestic law for journalists using information obtained from the Internet, the applicants could not foresee to the appropriate degree the consequences which the impugned publication might entail. This enables the Court to conclude that the requirement of lawfulness contained in the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention was not met.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Court does not consider it necessary to deal with the parties’ remaining submissions concerning this provision or to examine the proportionality of the interference at issue.\n\nAccordingly, there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention as regards this aspect of the case.\n\nII. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention provides:\n\n“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”\n\nA. Submissions of the first applicant\n\nThe first applicant submitted that the appropriate just satisfaction in the case would be a finding of a violation of Article 10 of the Convention and an indication of general measures to be adopted by Ukraine to bring its legislation and judicial practice into compliance with “European standards of freedom of expression” as regards the use of “socially important information, available on the Internet, the credibility of which is open to question.”\n\nThe Government did not comment on this aspect of the case.\n\nHaving regard to the circumstances of the present case and the conclusions the Court has reached under Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 64-68 above), it does not consider it necessary to examine this case under Article 46 of the Convention with a view to indicating specific measures that might be taken in order to put an end to a violation found in the case (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 194, ECHR 2004-V). The Court also notes that there is no call to award the first applicant any sum for just satisfaction.\n\nB. Submissions of the second applicant\n\n1. Damage\n\nThe second applicant claimed 7,000 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage.\n\nThe Government contested the second applicant’s claim.\n\nThe Court considers that the second applicant has suffered some distress and anxiety on account of the violations of his right to freedom of expression. Ruling on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, it awards him EUR 6,000 in this connection.\n\n2. Costs and expenses\n\nThe second applicant made no claim as to costs and expenses. Therefore, the Court makes no award under this head.\n\n3. Default interest\n\nThe Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n\nDecides to join to the merits the Government’s objection concerning the applicants’ victim status and rejects it;\n\nDeclares the application admissible;\n\nHolds that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of the domestic courts’ order to the second applicant to publish an official apology;\n\nHolds that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of the applicants’ punishment for the impugned publication;\n\nHolds\n\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the second applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\n\nDismisses the remainder of the second applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.\n\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 5 May 2011, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nClaudia Westerdiek Dean Spielmann,\n\nRegistrar President\n\n1. About 33,060 euros (EUR).\n\n2. About EUR 3,511.\n\n3. About EUR 2,394.\n\n1.

It might seem surprising that litigation presently pending in the District Court of Denver, Colorado (“the Colorado litigation”) concerning a disputed share purchase contract of the shares of an oil company registered in St. Kitts and Nevis and which is currently operating in Belize should give rise to an application in this jurisdiction for evidence to be taken on commission of an investigative journalist and a former theologian who specialises in the investigation of cults. This, nevertheless, is the background to the present application under s. 1 of the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856 (“the Act of 1856”).\n\n2. While this application raises many difficult questions of evidence, procedure, conflict of laws and the scope of journalistic privilege, it is necessary first to set out the background to this application.\n\nThe background to the Colorado litigation\n\n3. So far as can be gleaned from the Colorado pleadings, it seems that Ms. Morrice, a British national, is a petroleum geologist who, along with Mike Usher, a Belizean seismic surveyor, had long believed that Belize had (then undiscovered) oil reserves. To that end they set up a series of companies which are now controlled by International Natural Energy LLC (“INE”). A subsidiary of INE, Belize Natural Energy Ltd. (“BNE”) was granted a prospecting licence by the Belizean Government in January, 2003 and, to the surprise of industry observers, BNE discovered significant quantities of oil in June, 2005. Oil was then extracted and BNE commenced production and sale in January, 2006. In the words of Mr. Justice Bannister of the East Caribbean Supreme Court (Nevis Circuit) in SM Life Ventures v. Morrice size=”2″ face=”Verdana”>, in a judgment delivered on July 16th, 2012, BNE has since “been astonishingly successful”. The decision in SM Life Ventures provides an invaluable guide to the background to the subsequent dissension within INE, since it concerns an oppression petition brought in the Nevis courts by the dissident shareholders in the company.\n\n4. One of the other dissident shareholders is the present plaintiff in the Colorado proceedings, Jean Cornec. Mr. Cornec is a mining engineer who had previously worked in Belize identifying its strategraphy. Mr. Cornec and Ms. Morrice were among the five original promoters of the company and were among a handful of Class A shareholders. It would be tedious and unnecessary to chart the dissension which afflicted the company, but many of these difficulties appear to date back to 2002 when Ms. Morrice was introduced to Mr. Tony Quinn by another Class A shareholder, Ms. Shelia McCaffrey.\n\n5. Although Mr. Quinn is not a party to the litigation (and, hence, not represented before me), it is fair to say that his career has engendered some controversy. While it would be inappropriate to dwell on these matters in circumstances where he was not represented before me, the evidence before me nonetheless suggests that he professes what many might regard as rather unorthodox religious views. His supporters appear to subscribe passionately to these views and often participate in what are described as “Educo” seminars run by Mr. Quinn and his close associates. In this regard and to anticipate somewhat, it may be observed that Ms. Tallant, an investigative reporter with the Sunday World newspaper has penned several articles in that newspaper in which she brands Mr. Quinn as a sham who exploits the religious sensibilities of the vulnerable for financial gain, often using hypnosis and other techniques subverting the will and reason. Mr. Cornec (and others) maintain that Ms. Morrice herself has come under what they see as the baneful influence of Mr. Quinn and that she herself has effectively gifted large amounts of stock to him, while also permitting him to use the assets of the company in a wholly unorthodox fashion. Thus, for example, Bannister J. found that some US$1.8m of INE money had been spent in the last few years on security and surveillance personnel, thus allowing Mr. Quinn to hire what the judge described as virtually his own “private army”.\n\n6. Bannister J. also rejected the suggestion that Mr. Quinn was an original Class A shareholder or that he had been validly appointed to the board. It nonetheless seems clear that several members of the Board at least endeavoured to transfer some US$15m. worth of stock to Mr. Quinn in 2007. Bannister J. held that a 2007 operating agreement was invalid, since it trenched on the ownership rights of Class A shareholders and, furthermore, had stipulated that Class B shares were freely transferable only to other members who had completed one of Mr. Quinn’s Educo training courses. This is a classic example of oppression of minority shareholders, since it is impossible to see what legitimate reason there might be for such an eccentric – and there is, I fear, no other word for it – requirement.\n\n7. Bannister J. also found that the company had operated what was described as a loan release programme, whereby INE lent the members funds to be set-off against future profits. This arrangement – unorthodox in itself – was found by the judge to have been operated in a highly partial and selective manner and was “designed to punish INE members of which or of whom Ms. Morrice or Mr. Quinn disapproved”.\n\n8. This forms the general background to the Colorado litigation. In essence, the dissension in the company was damaging to the members. The minority objected strongly to Mr. Quinn’s involvement and considered that his presence as an eminence grise within the company dissuaded outside investment and damaged the share price. From their perspective, they felt that they had no option but to get out of a company which, while very successful, was nonetheless being operated by Ms. Morrice and Mr. Quinn in a partial and autocratic fashion. So far as Ms. Morrice was concerned, the minority – represented by Mr. Cornec – were dissatisfied and determined to cause trouble and there was little alternative but to buy them out.\n\n9. This ultimately led to the agreement reached in August, 2008 whereby Ms. Morrice agreed to purchase Mr. Cornec’s shares in INE for a sum just under US$17.6m. This was financed by an immediate cash payment of $2m and a promissory note for just under $15.6. The loan notes were payable in 12 instalments. Ms. Morrice made two principal payments, but has made no further payments since October, 2008. To date, therefore, Mr. Cornec has received a sum in excess of $4.7m.\n\n10. At the heart of Mr. Cornec’s claim, therefore, is a claim for breach of contract for a liquidated amount just under $13m., together with other related claims. For present purposes, however, what is most critical are the terms of Ms. Morrice’s counter-claim. In essence her case is that Mr. Cornec immediately violated the terms of the share purchase agreement in a material respect, thus entitling her to repudiate the agreement.\n\n11. Critically, the agreement provided for a non-disparagement clause. Clause 5.4 of the Share Purchase Agreement accordingly provided that Mr. Cornec agreed that:-\n\n“He will not in any way, costs to be made or otherwise disclose any disparaging comment, statement of communication about purchaser [Ms. Morrice] or any director or member of INE or their respective affiliates (a “Negative Remark”) either verbally or in writing to any person, entity or authority.”\n\nThe Share Purchase Agreement went on to provide that breach of the Clause is deemed to be a material misrepresentation and Clause 6.1.2 in particular provides that:-\n\n“Purchaser may offset any amounts due from Seller to Purchaser under this Section 6 against payments due under the Note.”\n\nCentral to Ms. Morrice’s counterclaim, therefore, is the contention that, the non-disparagement clause notwithstanding, Mr. Cornec arranged or organised for critical comments to be made in the media and elsewhere aimed at herself, Tony Quinn and INE. Specifically, Ms. Morrice contends that Mr. Cornec’s attorney, Ms. Katrina Skinner, travelled to Ireland at his behest in November, 2008 and there met a number of individuals who were broadly antipathetic to Mr. Quinn and, by extension, to Ms. Morrice. Particulars were given in the pleadings as to the nature of these contacts from November, 2008 onwards. For present purposes it suffices to say that it is contended Ms. Skinner met with Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant and that as a result of these contacts critical articles were published by Mr. Garde on the one hand and Ms. Tallant from the Sunday World, on the other.\n\n12. This may be a convenient point to say something about Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant. Mr. Garde is a director of a charity known as “Dialogue Ireland”. He has a particular interest in new religious movements, especially those where there is reason to suspect that undue psychological pressures or influence have been used over adherents.\n\n13. Ms. Tallant is an investigative reporter with the Sunday World. As already indicated, she has written extensively about Mr. Quinn in that newspaper. Two articles in particular were the subject of some debate in the hearing before me. The first of these is from the 1st March, 2009, which contains a lengthy interview with a disaffected former follower of Mr. Quinn, Marie Lalor. Ms. Lalor contends that she was effectively indoctrinated into believing that Mr. Quinn was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and that one of his closest followers was the reincarnation of Moses. She further contended that Mr. Quinn described memories of a previous life on the (mythical) island of Atlantis.\n\n14. The second article was published on 6th September, 2009, and is perhaps more directly relevant to the present application. It is headed “Exclusive: ‘Messiah’ Appointed to Company Board by Gullible Disciples – Guru Tony Strikes Oil”,. Underneath the legend ran “Cult Leader “Muscles” in on Followers’ Fortune”. The article then went on to say:-\n\n“Mucky Messiah Tony Quinn has struck oil and is on the verge of becoming a billionaire after muscling his way into the top of a company pumping thousands of barrels of black gold a week. Quinn is hoping he can join the ranks of the Texas barons after a team of his devoted followers appointed him as director of their company. But the controversial mind guru is now at the centre of a massive boardroom bust-up after his bizarre appointment and the influence he appears to have over his fellow directors. Quinn, who some followers believe is Jesus Christ, is facing allegations that he has muscled in on the company which was set up seven years ago by two avid followers of his Educo cult and that he is now creaming the profits for himself. Furious shareholders are also looking for answers about a golden handshake of $20m in free shares he was gifted when he was voted onto the board and whether or not he is now using profits to send to company associates on his own $60,000 a pop seminars. The fight over the oil company “International Natural Energy” (INE) has been brewing since 2007 when Quinn was appointed as director – two years after it struck oil in the impoverished Central American country of Belize. Incredibly, immediately after his appointment he announced on a Dublin stage that only “Eduocists” or his followers could become shareholders.”\n\nThe article continues in similar vein, along with quotations from unidentified shareholders questioning the circumstances in which Mr. Quinn came to be appointed as a director of the company. It then went on to give details of the Colorado litigation saying that:-\n\n“When in 2005 the then 82 shareholders were informed that the company had struck high grade oil on its first ever drill, Quinn decided to take a second look at the company. At the time Sheila McCaffrey credited Quinn’s mind technology for the oil find, but since then the battle for control of the control of the company has turned nasty. McCaffrey is no longer a working director and Cornec is currently suing INE for more than $10m. he says he is owed. After agreeing to sell his cut to Morrice, INE are countersuing Cornec saying that a campaign of negative remarks directed at Quinn and Morrice has damaged the value of the company and its attempts to raise finance by selling the shares.”\n\n15. This brings us to the heart of the present application. Essentially, Ms. Morrice contends that Mr. Cornec did not honour his side of the bargain and that he repeatedly violated the non-disparagement claim, not least by arranging for Ms. Skinner to come to Ireland in order to meet Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant and, indeed, others who were hostile to her, Mr. Quinn and INE. To this end, therefore, Ms. Morrice contends that Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant are relevant witnesses who ought to be deposed and that this Court should accordingly give effect to the letters rogatory issued by Judge Bronfin of the District Court of Denver on 31st May, 2012.\n\nThe nature of the application under the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856\n\n16. The first issue which arises was already the subject of a ruling by me in the course of the proceedings, namely, the status of the original ex parte order. The present application comes before me formally as a motion on the part of Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant to set aside an order made by me ex parte pursuant to s. 1 of the Act of 1856. The application is made ex parte precisely because that is the procedure contemplated by the Act of 1856 and Ord. 39, rr. 39-44 RSC. While I duly made the orders ought sought, I duly made it clear at the time that the order simply had a provisional status and that the moving party (Ms. Morrice) would carry the burden of making the application afresh in the event that the addressees of the order (Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant) sought to have it set aside.\n\n17. The Act of 1856 is, of course, a pre-Constitution statute which must, where necessary be read in a fashion which would make it conformable to the modern understanding of the requirements of fair procedures as prescribed by Article 40.3. It is absolutely clear that the courts cannot constitutionally make an order ex parte finally affecting the rights of the parties. An abundance of contemporary authority attests to this point: see, e.g., the judgment of Keane C.J. in DK v. Crowley [2002] 2 I.R. 744, that of Finlay Geoghegan J. in Chambers v. Keneflick [2005] IEHC 402, [2007] 3 I.R. 526 and my own judgments in Doyle v. Gibney [2011] IEHC 10 and Re Custom House Capital Ltd. (No.1) [2011] IEHC 399.\n\n18. It was for this reasons that I indicated that the ex parte procedure did not and could not finally affect the rights of Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant and the fact that an initial order was made in favour of Ms. Morrice created no presumption in her favour.\n\n19. The power to grant international assistance via the letters rogatory is, of course, a discretionary one. Naturally, in the interests of the international judicial comity, this Court will endeavour to give assistance where at all possible to requests of courts from foreign states and, as Denham J. put it in Novell Inc. v. MCB Enterprises [2001] 1 IR 608, it should “be slow to refuse such an order.” Nevertheless, before any such order could properly be granted, it would be necessary to establish that (i) the evidence proposed to be taken is relevant to the foreign proceedings; (ii) the application is not oppressive; (iii) the grant of the request would not override any established privilege or protection available to the prospective witness and (iv) the evidence so taken on commission is itself admissible under the law of the requesting state. The applicant for such judicial assistance must satisfy all four of these conditions. I propose now to consider each of these conditions.\n\nIs the evidence requested relevant to the foreign proceedings?\n\n20. In my view, the evidence sought is, subject to one major qualification, clearly relevant to the Colorado proceedings. While the ultimate meaning and effect of the non-disparagement clause will be a matter for the Denver courts, on any view, it prevents Mr. Cornec and his agents supplying information which is critical of INE and its members to a journalist such as Ms. Tallant or a person in the position of Mr. Garde. There seems little doubt on the evidence but that, for example, Mr. Cornec’s attorney and agent, Ms. Skinner, travelled to Ireland for this purpose and that there were subsequent contacts (direct and indirect) between Mr. Cornec, Ms Skinner and others with Ms. Tallant and Mr. Garde. Thus, for example, e-mail correspondence which was exhibited in the proceedings is strongly suggestive of the fact that assistance was given to Ms. Tallant to enable her to write the story regarding the INE litigation and Ms. Morrice and Mr. Quinn which was published in September, 2009.\n\n21. All of this suggests that Ms. Tallant and Mr. Garde are highly relevant witnesses to the Denver litigation so far as the counter-claim on the non-disparagement clause is concerned. Counsel for Mr. Garde, Mr. O’Tuathaill SC, argued that as Mr. Garde had only written about Mr. Quinn, the former’s evidence should not be regarded as relevant. This was because – or so Mr. O’Tuathaill SC argued – Bannister J. had found in his judgment in SM Life Ventures that the appointment of Mr. Quinn as a director was invalid, as was – it would appear – the allocation of Class A shares to him. Given that so far as Irish conflict of law rules are concerned, all matters concerning the validity of the appointment of officers and the transfer of shares fall to be determined by the court of the place where the company is domiciled, I am bound by these findings of Bannister J. in the East Caribbean Supreme Court. Nevertheless, it also seems clear from that judgment that Mr. Quinn remains a Class B shareholder – indeed, Bannister J. said as much – and, hence, a member of INE. While Mr. O’Tuathaill SC argued that it was not clear when Mr. Quinn acquired these shares, it seems evident that the transfer to Mr. Quinn pre-dated the 2008 agreement and is therefore prima facie covered by the non-disparagement clause.\n\n22. While Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant are relevant witnesses it must be observed that some of the questions contained in the letters rogatory were directed to inquiries about information supplied by Mr. Garde and Ms. Tallant respectively to Ms. Skinner.\n\n23. However, the supply of information by either Mr. Garde or Ms. Tallant is not material to any possible breach of the non-disparagement clause and I would propose, in any event, to disallow these questions as irrelevant.\n\nOppression\n\n24. Both Mr. O’Moore SC (for Ms. Tallant) and Mr. O’Tuathail SC (for Mr. Garde) argued that the making of these orders for judicial assistance would be oppressive of their clients. As Denham J. made clear in Novell, the court may decline to grant international judicial assistance on grounds of oppression. What, then, might constitute the oppression in question?\n\n25. The oppression was said to take a variety of forms. So far as Ms. Tallant was concerned, Mr. O’Moore S.C. pointed to two defamation proceedings which Mr. Quinn had issued against the Sunday World arising (one must infer) from articles she had written. The first of the proceedings had been issued and served in 2009, but had been otherwise allowed to lie fallow. The second set of proceedings has apparently been issued in 2011, but has yet to be served.\n\n26. Even if one assumes that these proceedings are still live – although I am inclined to agree with, counsel for Ms. Morrice, Mr. O’Callaghan S.C. who submitted that they should properly be regarded as dormant – I cannot see that their existence would in itself make the present application oppressive. I pass over for present purposes the fact that the proceedings are in the name of Mr. Quinn alone, given the closeness of the business relationship between himself and Ms. Morrice. The question, rather, is whether the very existence of the defamation proceedings would make it unfair for Ms. Tallant to be required to give evidence in aid of the Colorado proceedings.\n\n27. I cannot conclude that it would. After all, the issues are fundamentally different ones, even if there is some overlap in the dramatis personae and the factual background. Here the simple question is whether Ms. Skinner (or others persons acting in concert with Mr. Cornec) met with Ms. Tallant with a view to imparting information critical of INE, Ms. Morrice or Mr. Quinn. The issues in the defamation proceedings are much more complex and would (so far as March, 2009 article was concerned) presumably traverse issues such as whether Mr. Quinn claims to be the reincarnation of Jesus or to have recollections of a past life on Atlantis. Any defamation proceedings concerning the September 2009 article would relate to many of the issues dealt with by Bannister J. in SM Life Ventures and thus would encompass the disputes involving the shareholders in INE.\n\n28. This is fundamentally different, therefore, than the facts presented in Novell, a case where allegations of fraud were simultaneously being pursued against the respondents in proceedings both in Ireland and in Utah, with Denham J. concluding ([2001] 1 IR 608, 625) that it would:-\n\n“In all the circumstances be oppressive to permit the applicant to examine the respondents in advance of the hearing of the fraud action against them in Ireland.”\n\n29. As I have already indicated, I consider that the present case is fundamentally different, given the limited nature of the evidence sought to be tendered. Nor can it realistically be said that the present application represents some contrivance on the part of Ms. Morrice to secure this evidence as an indirect means of assisting Mr. Quinn in his defamation proceedings. While I agree that the application would have to be regarded as oppressive if that were her main motive in moving this application, I am nevertheless convinced that the present application is bona fide and is designed to secure the evidence of witnesses who can give relevant evidence in aid of the Colorado proceedings.\n\n30. This general point was also made on the part of Mr. Garde, since it was said that there was such antipathy between himself and Mr. Quinn and his supporters (including Ms. Morrice) as would make the application oppressive. It is true that this antipathy is mutual and it is scarcely concealed. Yet this does not in itself make the application oppressive, if (as here) there are independent reasons (namely, the materiality and relevance of the evidence of the prospective witnesses) to justify the making of the application.\n\n31. Mr. O’Tuathaill SC also emphasised that his client was an expert on religious cults and that it was oppressive to coerce an expert to give testimony where he did not freely consent to this procedure. It is true that in a leading English authority on the point, Seyfang v. G.D.Searle & Co. [1973] Q.B. 148, 152 Cooke J. agreed that the courts “will not as a general rule require an expert to give expert evidence against his wishes in a case where he has no connection with the facts or the history of the matter in issue”. That statement must, however, be understood in its proper context.\n\n32. In that case the applicant was suing the manufacturers of contraceptive pills in the United States for negligence, claiming that she having developed thrombo-phlebitis as a result with horrific personal consequences. To that end the US courts had issued letters rogatory directed at securing the testimony of three medical experts, all of whom were based in the UK and who had done research for the UK Medical Research Council on the possible link between the administration of the contraceptive pill and thrombo-phelibitis.\n\n33. While Cooke J. accepted that s.1 of the Act of 1856 applied to expert testimony, he concluded that it would be oppressive to require an expert to give testimony which might amount to a breach of confidence and “where the preparation of the evidence required of him would require considerable time and study” and in this regard the judge distinguished between witnesses as to fact and expert witnesses. While I respectfully agree with this analysis, it must nonetheless be recalled that Mr. Garde’s testimony is not here required qua expert. Rather his testimony is sought as a witness as to fact, whether Ms. Skinner (and others) spoke with him and briefed him on the involvement of Mr. Quinn in the affairs of INE. For these reasons, the principles articulated with regard to expert testimony articulated by Cooke J. in Seyfang do not apply to the present case.\n\n34. For these reasons, therefore, I would reject the argument based on oppression.\n\nShould Ms. Tallant be obliged to reveal her sources?\n\n35. I now turn to the question of whether, as a matter of Irish law, a court could or would oblige a journalist to disclose her sources in the circumstances of the present case. Ms. Tallant objects in principle to being compelled to give evidence since it would (or might) disclose her sources. She further contends that the giving of evidence in this fashion under compulsion would inhibit her in her vital task of collecting and assembling material for future publication in her role as a journalist.\n\n36. Before considering this argument, I should record that the parties were agreed that the three relevant Irish authorities on point were Re Kevin O’Kelly (1974) 108 I.L.T.R. 97, Mahon v. Keena [2009] IESC 64, [2010] 1 IR 336 and Walsh v. Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd. [2012] IEHC 353. I first propose to examine these three decisions and then to proceed to apply the principles contained therein to the facts of the present case.\n\n37. The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Re Kevin O’Kelly is one which has, I think, has not been fully understood in the intervening years. The background to this case was as follows. The late Mr. O’Kelly was a well-known RTE broadcaster of the highest personal integrity. He had then recently interviewed Sean MacStiofáin, the then soi disant “Chief of Staff” of an illegal organisation. This interview was then broadcast on RTE – as both interviewer and interviewee had intended – and, indeed, the main purpose of the interview was to allow Mr. MacStiofáin in his capacity as “Chief of Staff” to convey the views of the illegal organisation in question to the public at large.\n\n38. At Mr. MacStiofáin’s subsequent trial for membership of that organisation, Mr. O’Kelly was asked to confirm Mr. MacStiofáin’s identity as the voice on the recorded tape. Mr. O’Kelly refused, citing journalistic privilege. The Special Criminal Court adjudged him to be in contempt of court and the Court of Criminal Appeal later heard an appeal against sentence only and, as Walsh J. stressed in his judgment, Mr. O’Kelly did not in fact even appeal his conviction.\n\n39. Against that background the comments of Walsh J. regarding the scope of journalistic privilege with regard to their sources must be adjudged to be strictly obiter. But Walsh J. was surely correct in saying that, subject to an exception I will consider in a moment, no journalistic privilege could have attended Mr. O’Kelly’s evidence precisely because the open identification of Mr. MacStiofáin as “Chief of Staff” was itself an intrinsic part of the entire broadcast. As Walsh J. put it ((1974) 108 I.L.T.R. 97, 101):-\n\n“In fact, the whole value of the publication of the interview from Mr. O’Kelly’s point of view depended upon the fact that the persons to whom the interview would be published would be made aware that the person interviewed was Mr. Sean MacStiofáin.”\n\n40. Indeed, it may be observed in passing that a lawyer could not assert legal professional privilege were he or she to be placed in a somewhat analogous situation. Thus, in Cullen v. Wicklow County Manager [2010] IESC 49, [2011] 1 IR 152 the Supreme Court held that a solicitor on record for a party to litigation cannot assert legal professional privilege over the identity of her client, since to do so would be inconsistent with the very act of taking proceedings.\n\n41. In these circumstances, a journalist could only possibly assert privilege where the identity of the person in the broadcast was itself confidential and withheld from the listeners or viewers, such as might occur where, for example, the interview was with the victim of a sexual assault. It is against that general background that the decision in O’Kelly must be understood and given these particular facts, the entire argument based on journalistic privilege was entirely misplaced to begin with.\n\n42. While I have thus far loosely spoken of a journalistic privilege, there is, in fact, in strictness, no such thing. The protection is rather the high value which the law places on the dissemination of information and public debate. Journalists are central to that entire process, a point expressly recognised by Article 40.6.1.i of the Constitution itself when it recognises “the rightful liberty of expression” on the part of the press, albeit counter-balanced by the stipulation that this rightful liberty shall not be used to undermine “public order or morality or the authority of the State.” Perhaps these constitutional fundamentals have been overlooked at times, in part possibly because the syntax and drafting of this particular clause is (uncharacteristically) awkward given that the critical proviso is somewhat obscured by being placed within a subordinate clause. The Irish language version is actually much clearer than its English language counterpart, since the privileged status of the organs of public opinion is more elegantly described, not least given that it is set out in a stand alone sentence at the end of the relevant second paragraph.\n\n43. Irrespective, however, of the languages used, the constitutional right in question would be meaningless if the law could not (or would not) protect the general right of journalists to protect their sources. This would be especially true of the particular example of that rightful liberty afforded by Article 40.6.1.i which is expressly enumerated therein – criticism of Government policy (“tuairimí léirmheasa ar bheartas an Rialtas”) – if no such protection were available.\n\n44. But this right is not absolute or inviolable. In that respect, this protection differs in one key respect from legal professional privilege which, once applicable, cannot be overridden by a court by reference to some general balancing test based on the public interest. This, in essence, is what Walsh J. said in O’Kelly when he commented that:\n\n“There may be occasions when different aspects of the public interest may require a resolution of a conflict of interests which may be involved in the disclosure or non-disclosure of evidence but if there be such a conflict, then the sole power of resolving it rests with the courts.”\n\n45. Similar views were expressed by Fennelly J. in Mahon v. Keena ([2010] 1 IR 336, 363):-\n\n“While the present case does not concern information about the commission of a serious criminal offences, it cannot be doubted such a case could arise. Who would decide whether the journalist’s source had to be protected? There can be only one answer. In the event of conflict, whether in a civil or criminal context, the courts must adjudicate and decide, while allowing all due respect to the principle of journalistic privilege. No citizen has the right to claim immunity from the processes of the law.”\n\n46. Yet the public interest in ensuring that journalists can protect their sources remains very high, since journalism is central to the free flow of information which is essential in a free society. This is all underscored and tacitly complemented by the entire constitutional edifice, such as the democratic nature of the State (Article 5); the accountability of the executive branch to the Dáil (Article 28.4.1) and the provisions in relation to elections and referenda. I may venture here to repeat my comments in Doherty v. Referendum Commission [2012] IEHC 211 to the effect that the referendum process presupposes that the citizenry “will engage in robust political debate so that the forces of deliberation will prevail over the arbitrary and irrational so that, in this civic democracy, reasoned argument would prevail in this triumph of discourse”. If journalism and the media did not enjoy at least a general protection in respect of their sources, that robust political debate – a sine qua non in any democratic society – would be still born. Only the naïve would suggest otherwise.\n\n47. In passing, it might be observed that while Article 10ECHR does not in terms privilege the media in the same way as Article 40.6 does, yet the importance of press freedom has been a cornerstone of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights since at least the judgment in Sunday Times Ltd. v. United Kingdom (1979) E.H.R.R. 1 and confirmed in ringing terms in Goodwin v. United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 123, 143. The protection of journalistic sources is, subject to appropriate exceptions, accordingly, regarded as a core value protected by Article 10ECHR.\n\n48. This is perhaps a convenient place to consider the decision of the Supreme Court in Mahon v. Keena, where the general extent of the Article 10ECHR right post-Goodwin on the part of journalists to protect their sources was expounded. All parties were agreed that in the light of the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in McD. v. L. [2009] IESC 81, it must be acknowledged that Article 10ECHR is not, as such, directly effective in Irish law, but rather has effect only under the conditions actually specified in the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003 (“the Act of 2003”). Additionally, as a consequence of the Supreme Court’s decision in Carmody v. Minister for Justice and Equality [2009] IESC 71, [2010] 1 ILRM 157 this Court is first required to examine the question presented for resolution under the terms of the Constitution. As Murray C.J. noted in Carmody, is only that in the event that the Constitution cannot avail the litigant who pleads that his or her constitutional rights have been infringed that the Court can then turn to a consideration of the position under the Act of 2003.\n\n49. While this is the sequence which is prescribed in such cases by Carmody, in truth it hardly matters in this case, since the overlap between the two documents with regard to the role of the media is virtually a complete one, even if allowance is made for the fact that, unlike Article 40.6.1, the text of Article 10 ECHR does not actually seek to confer on the media a special or privileged position in terms of public debate or in criticism of government policy. In both cases, the approach is the same: has the case for the restriction on or overriding journalistic privilege – I am here returning to the convenient, if slightly inaccurate, shorthand – been convincingly established?\n\n50. In Mahon the issue was whether the two Irish Times journalists in question could claim privilege from non-disclosure in respect of a document which originally emanated from the Mahon Tribunal raising questions about the finances of the then Taoiseach and suggested that he had received certain payments in an irregular manner. This document had been sent to them anonymously and on an unsolicited basis, but it formed the basis of a leading story in The Irish Times on 21st September 2006. The publication of that story certainly engaged the principle of criticism of Government policy and it is difficult to think of anything more central to a consideration of the public interest in publication.\n\n51. The journalists in question had, however, destroyed the document lest its production might assist in identifying the source. This was the single factor which this Court considered had weighed heavily against the journalists when they sought to invoke journalistic privilege to resist the making of orders compelling them to assist the Tribunal in identifying the provenance of the document in question. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the case for disclosure had not been “convincingly established” (to use the language of Goodwin). As Fennelly J. put it, where the source was anonymous, the benefit from any disclosure a journalist might be compelled to make is speculative at best.\n\n52. This brings me to a consideration of the last of the three cases, Walsh v. News Group Newspapers Ltd. [2012] IEHC 353. The plaintiff in that case is very prominent in popular music circles and he has achieved a near iconic status as a judge of emerging musical talent in a highly acclaimed television series. He sued for defamation following the publication of an article which (falsely) asserted that he had sexually assaulted a young man in a Dublin nightclub. It was not disputed but that the allegations were made by a Mr. Watters and that they were entirely false.\n\n53. More disturbingly, it then appeared that a journalist attached to the defendant newspaper had offered financial inducements to Mr. Watters if he agreed to make a complaint to Gardaí. When the plaintiff sought discovery of all contacts between the journalist and Mr. Watters, the newspaper confirmed that Mr. Watters was not a source. O’Neill J. accepted that newspaper sources generally enjoyed protection in the light of the decision in Mahon v. Keena. He went on to observe:-\n\n“If Mr. Watters is not a journalistic source and if his identity is well established, as it is, the only basis, in my opinion, upon which journalistic privilege in respect of communications between the defendants and Mr. Watters could rest would be if it were shown that a disclosure of the content of the communications between Mr. Watters and the defendant could lead to the disclosure of another source either in respect of the story the subject matter of these proceedings or other investigations conducted by the defendants’ journalists. Thus, discovery should be made in respect of communications between the defendants and Mr. Watters unless the defendants can assert privilege on the basis that these communications will disclose another source. If necessary, the court can inspect these documents to exclude from discovery documents leading to the identification of other sources.”\n\nShould the Court order disclosure where the sources have been identified or least are identifiable?\n\n54. This brings us directly to the critical question: should the Court order Ms. Tallant to give evidence in circumstances where it is more or less accepted who the identity of her sources are, or, at the very least, that their identity can be discerned from the material exhibited in both the Colorado proceedings and in the present application. Ms. Tallant has, in fact, sworn an affidavit in the Colorado proceedings in June 2010 in which she admitted that Ms. Lalor was her source in respect of the first article. So far as the second article is concerned, Ms. Tallant stated:-\n\n“The first article I wrote about Mr. Quinn’s involvement in International Natural Energy (“INE”) was September 6, 2009. My source for this story was a group of Irish investors in INE who were upset about Mr. Quinn’s involvement in INE. Jean Cornec was not a source for this story.”\n\n55. While Mr. Cornec may not have been a source for this story, there is considerable evidence which suggests that Ms. Tallant has met with other persons who are associated with Mr. Cornec in connection with the publication of material pertaining to INE. Such persons would seem to include Mr. Cornec’s wife, Ms. Frothingham, Ms. Skinner, Ms. Lalor and Ms. Lalor’s son, Mr. Fennelly. Thus, for example, among the correspondence discovered in the Colorado proceedings (and exhibited for the purposes of the present application), is an email from Ms. Lalor to Ms. Skinner on 31st August, 2009, where she states:-\n\n“…Nicola [Tallant] coming down tomorrow so maybe we should call you as you need to brief her before she does that article.”\n\n56. Mr. Cornec, Ms. MacCaffrey and Ms. Frothingham are all listed as recipients of this email. On the 5th September 2009 Ms. Skinner replied to Ms. Lalor (which email was also copied to Mr. Cornec) to the effect that she should wait “until the oil story comes out” and that “this weekend’s story is going to be crazy…just crazy”. This is plainly a reference to the article which Ms. Tallant subsequently authored on 9th September, 2009, dealing with the affairs of INE, Ms. Morrice and Mr. Quinn and of which Ms. Skinner obviously had advance knowledge. All of this strongly suggests that Ms. Tallant was briefed by Ms. Lalor and Ms. Skinner in advance of the September, 2009 article dealing with the affairs of INE and that Mr. Cornec was fully aware of these developments.\n\n57. Against that background Mr. O’Callaghan SC argued forcefully that the jurisprudence from Goodwin onwards merely concerned the identification of sources and that once the sources had been so identified, the privilege simply lapsed. I would, however, incline to approach the matter in a different way and, following the analysis found in the judgment of Fennelly J. in Mahon, I would prefer to weigh the competing interests of the parties before arriving at a conclusion.\n\n58. In the first place, Ms. Tallant has a strong interest in publishing material concerning Mr. Quinn and the affairs of INE. If, as she maintains, Mr. Quinn holds unorthodox religious views and is effectively the leader of a religious cult which has used psychological techniques as a means of controlling gullible adherents, then – to use the language of Article 40.6.1 – the media are clearly entitled to educate public opinion in this regard. This is perhaps especially true if Mr. Quinn were to have access to enormous funds via what appears to be the largesse of some of the founding members of INE.\n\n59. Second, while Ms. Tallant’s evidence would be plainly relevant to the Colorado proceedings, it should be remarked that such evidence is essentially confirmatory of evidence already available to Ms. Morrice through the US depositions and discovery process. In other words, Ms. Morrice already knows that Ms. Skinner and Ms. Lalor spoke with Ms. Tallant shortly in advance of the September, 2009 article. It would be unrealistic to suggest that these discussions did not concern the affairs of Ms. Morrice and Mr. Quinn, thus potentially triggering the application of the non-disparagement clause. Given that this avenue is already open to Ms. Morrice – and she has already successfully availed of it – this weakens the case for disclosure on the part of Ms. Tallant as her evidence – while undoubtedly helpful and confirmatory of other evidence – cannot be said to be essential.\n\n60. Third, it may be recalled that the Colorado proceedings merely involve commercial proceedings, albeit for very significant sums of money. This is not to take from the intrinsic importance of these proceedings, but the public interest in disclosure is not as compelling as would have been the case, for example, where the potential innocence of a third party was at stake in criminal proceedings (cf. here by analogy the comments in this regard of Hardiman J. in Howlin v. Morris [2005] IESC 85, [2006] 2 IR 324).\n\n61. Fourth, it cannot be said that there is any ex ante distinction between the protection of the source on the one hand and the contents of what the source disclosed on the other. In some cases – perhaps a majority – the source will wish to have their identity protected. In other instances, the source will wish to have the contents of what they actually said protected, even if they been identified as a source for the article. In both cases, the public interest in protecting the journalist from compelled disclosure is very high, since the exploration of the contents of any discussions with the source also has the ability significantly to hamper the exercise of freedom by the journalist in question.\n\n62. Moreover, unlike the situation in Walsh, the letters rogatory are directed to communications between the journalist and her sources. By contrast, in Walsh the complainant who had made the false allegation had been publicly identified and was not a source. Furthermore, Mr. Walsh’s interest in vindicating his good name in the wake of a malicious allegation was exceptionally high.\n\n63. Weighing all these factors, I am not persuaded that the case for compelling Ms. Tallant to give evidence has been, in the words of the European Court in Goodwin, “convincingly established.” Given that the questions posed in the letters rogatory inevitably probe the identity of her sources and the information conveyed to her by those sources as part of a core journalistic activity in respect of which she could properly decline to answer if those questions were posed to her in that form and in those circumstances in an Irish court, I would accordingly decline to give effect to the letters rogatory so far as Ms. Tallant is concerned.\n\n64. Here it may be noted that s. 5 of the Act of 1856 preserves the privileges and protections otherwise available to the witness in purely domestic proceedings. Given the circumstances of the present case, as Ms. Tallant could invoke the protections afforded by Article 40.6.1 (and, for that matter, were it necessary to do so, Article 10 ECHR) to resist questioning directed to identifying the contents of information supplied to her as a precursor to writing the articles in question, it follows equally that she cannot be compelled to do so by the enforcement of the letters rogatory.\n\nWhether the court should order Mr. Garde to give evidence\n\n65. I now turn to the position of Mr. Garde. While Mr. Garde is not a journalist in the strict sense of the term, it is clear from that his activities involve the chronicling of the activities of religious cults. Part of the problem here is that the traditional distinction between journalists and laypeople has broken down in recent decades, not least with the rise of social media. It is probably not necessary here to discuss questions such as whether the casual participant on an internet discussion site could invoke Goodwin-style privileges, although the issue may not be altogether far removed from the facts of this case.\n\n66. Yet Mr. Garde’s activities fall squarely within the “education of public opinion” envisaged by Article 40.6.1. A person who blogs on an internet site can just as readily constitute an “organ of public opinion” as those which were more familiar in 1937 and which are mentioned (but only as examples) in Article 40.6.1, namely, the radio, the press and the cinema. Since Mr. Garde’s activities fall squarely within the education of public opinion, there is a high constitutional value in ensuring that his right to voice these views in relation to the actions of religious cults is protected. It does not require much imagination to accept that critical information in relation to the actions of those bodies would dry up if Mr. Garde could be compelled to reveal this information, whether in the course of litigation or otherwise. It is obvious from the very text of Article 40.6.1 that the right to educate (and influence) public opinion is at the very heart of the rightful liberty of expression. That rightful liberty would be compromised – perhaps even completely jeopardised – if disclosure of sources and discussions with sources could readily be compelled through litigation.\n\n67. It follows, therefore, that Mr. Garde has a similar interest to that of Ms. Tallant in ensuring that his sources are likewise protected. Of course, just as with Ms. Tallant, he is plainly a relevant witness to the Colorado litigation. Ms. Skinner (and others associated with Mr. Cornec) also seems to have either met with or corresponded with him. But his evidence would also be substantially confirmatory of material already in possession of Ms. Morrice. There are, moreover, no strong competing arguments to the contrary which would weigh against the public interest in ensuring that Mr. Garde is free from disclosing his sources or the contents of these discussions.\n\n68. Applying, in essence, therefore, the same balancing test as already applied in the case of Ms. Tallant, I would hold that Mr. Garde is entitled to assert an immunity from disclosure in the present case.\n\nThe position of journalists under Colorado law\n\n69. In view of the conclusions I have just reached, it would not seem to me to be necessary or desirable that I should express a view on the question of foreign law presented before me, namely, the construction of Colorado’s press freedom statute and whether Ms. Tallant and Mr. Garde would have been able to avail of it in order to assert a journalistic privilege conferred by statute.\n\nConclusions\n\n70. In conclusion, therefore, I respectfully decline to give effect to the letters rogatory for the reasons stated in this judgment.\n\nApproved: Hogan J.\n\nMurphy v. Independent Radio and Television Commission\n\n[1997] IEHC 71; [1999] 1 IR 12; [1997] 2 ILRM 467 Judgment of Mr. Justice Geoghegan delivered the 25th day of April, 1997\n\n1. This is an application for Judicial Review of a decision of the first named Respondent dated the 31st day of March, 1995 refusing to permit the Applicant to transmit a particular advertisement on the radio station known as “98 FM”. I should state at the outset that the owners of “98 FM” had no objection to broadcasting the advertisement if they were satisfied that they were lawfully entitled to do so but they were informed by the first named Respondent, being the relevant statutory authority, that they were prohibited from doing so by virtue of Section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988. That subsection provides that:-\n\n“No advertisement shall be broadcast which is directed towards any religious or political end or which has relation to an industrial dispute”.\n\n2. The advertisement in question read as follows:-\n\n“What think ye of Christ? Would you, like Peter, boldly say he is the Son of the living God, have you ever exposed yourself to the historical facts about Christ, the Irish Faith Centre are presenting for Easter Week an hour long video by Dr. Gene Scott, PhD on the evidence for the resurrection from Monday, 10th to Saturday, 15th April every night at 8.30 and Easter Sunday at 11.30 a.m. and also live by satellite at 7.30 p.m., The Irish Faith Centre, 360A North Circular Road, Phibsboro”.\n\n3. The Applicant seeks to impugn the refusal to broadcast this advertisement on the grounds:-\n\n(1) that it does not breach Section 10(3) of the 1988 Act;\n\n(2) that if contrary to the Applicant’s contention it does breach that subsection, then the subsection is invalid having regard to the Constitution.\n\n4. Although Counsel for the Applicant relies on both arguments, I think it is fair to say, that the greatest stress was on the second. In support of the first argument Counsel for the Applicant suggests that the advertisement is in essence an advertisement for a showing of a video and the showing of a live communication by satellite and that it is not directly an advertisement for some religious belief or doctrine. On any fair reading of this advertisement, I think that one would have to interpret it as being more than a mere notification of an event. The question, therefore, of whether notification of a religious event necessarily infringes Section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 does not arise in this case and that being so I do not think it would be advisable or proper for me to make any decision on it. What I am deciding is that this particular advertisement does infringe Section 10(3) or at the very least that the first named Respondent was entitled to take the view that it did. The advertisers are called in the advertisement “The Irish Faith Centre”. It is perfectly obvious from the whole tenor of the advertisement that the listener is being led to at least favourably consider the proposition that Christ is the Son of the living God and that the traditional “beliefs” about Christ are historical facts. In my opinion, the advertisement is a great deal more than a mere notification of an event. Given that Section 10(3) itself has a broad thrust, I think that the advertisement would clearly infringe the subsection.\n\n5. I turn, therefore, to consider whether the subsection is unconstitutional. Four different provisions of the constitution are relied on by the Applicant. These are:-\n\n(1) Article 40(3)(1) as conferring the unenumerated right to communicate as identified by Costello P. in Attorney General -v- Paper Link Limited 1984 ILRM 373.\n\n(2) Article 40(6)(1) which confers “the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions”.\n\n(3) Article 44(2)(1) which guarantees freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion to every citizen subject to public order and morality.\n\n(4) Article 44(2)(3) which prohibits the imposition by the State of any disabilities or the making of any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.\n\n6. I propose to deal with the Article 44 arguments first as they present less difficulty than the arguments based on Article 40. In my view, Section 10(3) of the 1988 Act in no way impedes freedom of conscience or the free profession or practice of religion. As Counsel for the Attorney General has pointed out, the true meaning of Article 44(2)(1) has been explained by Walsh J. in McGee -v-Attorney General 1974 IR 284 at 316, Walsh J. observed as follows:-\n\n“The whole context in which the question of conscience appears in Article 44 is one dealing with the exercise of religion and the free profession and practice of religion. Within that context, the meaning of Section 2, subsection 1 of Article 44 is that no person shall directly or indirectly be coerced or compelled to act contrary to his conscience insofar as the practice of religion is concerned, and subject to public order and morality, is free to profess and practise the religion of his choice in accordance with his conscience…..what the Article guarantees is the right not to be compelled or coerced into living in a way which is contrary to one’s conscience insofar as the exercise, practice or profession of religion is concerned”.\n\n7. The prohibition on this advertisement is not an attack on freedom of conscience or the free practice of religion. Indeed if anything the advertisement "
