        "text": "1 After the expulsion of Russia from the Council of Europe on 16 March 2022, the organization has 46 member states, for a Europe of 700 million people. However, the Convention ceased to apply to Russia on 16 September 2022 and the Court retains a residual jurisdiction with respect to acts and omissions capable of giving rise to a violation of the Convention until that date. Thus, the reference to 800 million people is still, at least for some time, relevant as regards the Court. See further Ch 1, section 6, pp 28–30.\n\n2 Through the right of individual petition, the Convention system provides for a ‘direct impact’ of international human rights law; see further Cassel, 2 CJOIL 1 (2001) p 133.\n\n3 For the operation of the former Commission and Court of Human Rights, see Chs 22 and 24 of the first edition of this book.\n\n4 See, for an insider’s view of how the Court operates in practice with special reference to the role of the Court’s President, Costa, La Cour européenne des droits de l’homme: Des judges pour la liberté, 1st edn 2013 and 2nd edn 2017. Judge Costa was President of the Court from 2007 to 2011. On reform of the Court generally, see Wildhaber, The European Court of Human Rights 1998–2006: History, Achievements, Reform, 2006; also Benoît-Rohmer, 73 RTDH 3 (2008) and Reform of the European Human Rights System: Proceedings of the High-level Seminar, Oslo, 2004, Directorate General of Human Rights, Strasbourg: Council of Europe, 2004.\n\n5 At the end of 2021 there were 70,150 cases pending before a judicial formation. More than 50 per cent of those cases concerned the following four countries: Russia (24.2 per cent), Turkey (21.7 per cent), Ukraine (16.2 per cent), and Romania (8.1 per cent). Other high-count countries are: Italy (5.2 per cent), Poland (3.2 per cent), Azerbaijan (3 per cent), Serbia (2.6 per cent), Greece (2 per cent), and Armenia (1.9 per cent). Out of the 70,150 pending cases, 30,600 were allocated to the Grand Chamber or a Chamber; 31,850 to Committee (repetitive cases); and 7,700 to single-judge formation. For detailed statistical information on the work of the Court and types of cases brought, see the Court’s website, available at: http://www.echr.coe.int. For further statistical information on the caseload of the Convention institutions in early years, see ch 3 of the third edition of this book.\n\n6 For a description of Protocol 14, see section 6.I, pp 177–178.\n\n7 Since the setting up of the new Court, the number of cases has consistently increased. In 1999, 8,400 cases were allocated to a judicial formation; by 2008 the number had gone up to 49,816, rising to 65,200 in 2012. In 2011, the number of applications pending before a judicial formation achieved its peak, rising to 151,600. In the ensuing period, the Court managed to achieve a steep decrease in the stock of allocated applications, down to 64,850 pending cases in 2015. However, in 2016 both the number of applications allocated to a judicial formation increased (by 32 per cent compared with 2015) and the Court’s backlog (79,750 pending cases before a judicial formation). The high number of cases on the Court’s docket can be explained by the institutional and, at places, existential challenges to the democratic and rule-of-law orders of the three countries making up more than 50 per cent of the Court’s backlog (Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine; see n 5). For instance, in the entire 2015 in respect of Turkey, 2,210 cases were allocated to a judicial formation. Following the 2016 coup d’état attempt and a large-scale crackdown on those supposedly linked to the event, the number of cases in 2016 reached 8,307, and for the period between January and July 2017 a total of 16,568 cases has been allocated to a judicial formation. The decrease in the pending cases that occurred in the second part of 2017 is related to the fact that a number of cases were repatriated to the national system due to a non-exhaustion of a new domestic remedy (see, eg, on the introduction of new remedies in Turkey following the coup d’état attempt, Çatal v Turkey No 2873/17 (2017) DA, and Köksal v Turkey No 70478/16 (2017) DA or following a strike out (primarily of the more than 12,000 post-Ivanov cases in the Burmych and Others v Ukraine Nos 46852/13 et al (2017) GC case). More recently, in Turan and Others v Turkey Nos 75805/16 et al (2021), the Court processed in a single judgment 427 cases by focusing on a single aspect of the cases (pre-trial detention of judges suspected of membership of an illegal organization following the coup d’état attempt) and deciding that, as a matter of judicial policy, it would not examine the remaining complaint raised in the individual applications).\n\n8 Final Report of the Group of Wise Persons to the Committee of Ministers, Council of Europe, November 2006 (available at: http://www.echr.coe.int). See also Future Developments of the European Court of Human Rights in the Light of the Wise Persons Report: proceedings of the colloquy, San Marino, 22–23 March, Council of Europe, 2007.\n\n9 See section 6, pp 176–179 on reform of the Court.\n\n10 For details of the current composition of the Court, see the Court’s website, available at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n11 In April 2022, 15 judges were women.\n\n12 See section 6.I, pp 177–178 on Protocol 14.\n\n13 Article 23(6) of the Convention. There is no provision or procedure for the formal impeachment of sitting judges. The matter is instead regulated by Article 24 of the Convention and Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, which allow for dismissal by a two-thirds majority of the plenary Court. It has never happened.\n\n14 On this point and the election of judges in general, see Hedigan, in Kohen, ed, Liber Amicorum Lucius Caflisch, 2007, pp 235–253. See further Krüger, 8 RUDH (1996); Valticos, in Liber Amicorum M-A Eissen, 1995; Carrillo-Salcedo, 1 RUDH (1997); and ‘Judicial Independence: The Law and Practice of Appointments to the European Court of Human Rights’ Interights, May 2003.\n\n15 This modification aims to enable highly qualified judges to serve the full nine-year term of office and thereby reinforce the consistency of the membership of the Court.\n\n16 For the judges’ curricula vitae, see http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n17 For the text, see Rule 3, Rules of Court.\n\n18 Resolution on Judicial Ethics, Adopted by the Plenary Court on 21 June 2021. Available on the Court’s internet site (http://www.echr.coe.int).\n\n19 ETS 162. In force 1998.\n\n20 Article 2; also Committee of Ministers’ Resolution ‘On the Status and Conditions of Service of Judges of the European Court of Human Rights and of the Commissioner of Human Rights’ (2009) 5, Article 2.\n\n21 In a recent (and second ever) Decision on a request for the waiver of immunity of the husband of a sitting judge, when referring to his immunity the Court used the formulation of an immunity that the husband ‘derives from the immunity of his spouse’ (Decision on request from the Ukrainian authorities for the waiver of immunity of Judge Yudkivska’s spouse; see Court press release 8 July 2020). It is therefore more precise to talk about a derivative and not self-standing immunity when discussing the immunities of spouses and minor children.\n\n22 Articles 1 and 3.\n\n23 Article 3. Article 5 extends the privileges and immunities to the Registrar and Deputy Registrar of the Court.\n\n24 Article 6. Official correspondence and other communications of the Court, judges, or the registry may not be held up or subjected to censorship; Article 6(2).\n\n25 The Court rejected a request from the Romanian Government to waive the immunity of Judge Birsan but allowed the request to waive the immunity in respect of his wife, who was being investigated for suspected criminal offences. In its Decision, the Court considered that Romania had violated the immunity of Judge Birsan and his wife by searching his home on 6 October 2011. The Decision also emphasized that the waiving of immunity does not have retroactive effect; see Court Registrar Press Release annexing the Court’s Decision (29 November 2011). The plenary Court also rejected a request from the Ukrainian Government to waive the immunity of the husband of Judge Yudkivska. It found that the Ukrainian authorities had investigated him in breach of his immunity (see n 21).\n\n26 By Article 26 Convention. Though that Article simply provides that they may be re-elected, Rule 8(3), Rules of Court limits this to one re-election. Rule 8(5) sets out elaborate procedures for the elections.\n\n27 Note also the role of the Bureau, which assists the President in directing the work and administration of the Court. It is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents, the three Section Presidents, and assisted by the Registrar and the Deputy Registrars—Rule 9A of the Rules of Court.\n\n28 See the Court’s website for, inter alia, practice directions issued by the President on interim measures, just satisfaction, and written pleadings, available at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n29 The Court’s budget for 2022 amounted to €74,510,300. Budgetary decisions are taken by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe bears the expenditure on the Court (Article 50 Convention). The Court also has its special account established following the Brighton Conference (2012) for the receipt of voluntary contributions, which are mainly used to recruit lawyers to deal with the backlog. The Brussels Declaration invited the states to make voluntary contributions to the Court’s special account. The importance of retaining a sufficient budget for the Court was also emphasized in the Copenhagen Declaration (para 52).\n\n30 See, for a critical view of the system with proposals for reform, Judicial Independence: The Law and Practice of Appointments to the European Court of Human Rights, Interights, 2003; Drzemczewski, 4 EHRLR 377 (2010); and Procedure for electing judges to the European Court of Human Rights, Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights information document, AS/Jur/inf (2013)02. See also the report of the Open Society Justice Initiative and the ICJ, Strengthening from Within: Law and Practice in the Selection of Human Rights Judges and Commissioners, 2017.\n\n31 See the country-specific ‘table of progress’ on the elections of judges to the Court available at: http://www.website-pace.net.\n\n32 See section 6, pp 176–181.\n\n33 See Engel, 32 HRLJ (2013) pp 448–455.\n\n34 See ResCM/Res (2010)26, On the Establishment of an Advisory Panel of Experts on Candidates for Election as Judge to the European Court of Human Right.\n\n35 See the Panel’s Report of Activities for the Attention of the Steering Committee for Human Rights (15 May 2013) GT-GDR-E (2013)004 and proposals to enable the Panel to carry out its tasks effectively. For example, that the PACE sub-committee should not accept any list containing names of candidates not considered qualified by the Panel or that the Sub-Committee should not proceed with an election until it has received the Panel’s comments; at section 15. See also the Panel’s elucidation, section 5, of the requirements of Article 21(1), Convention. See further the Panel’s 2nd and 3rd activity reports 2016 (sections 54–56), and 2017 (sections 48, 53–54).\n\n36 Resolution 2278 (2019) Modification of various provisions of the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure, 11 April 2019, para 2.4.\n\n37 See the Panel’s 4th activity report (2019).\n\n38 Decision CM/Del/Dec(2019)1333/4.1, 9 January 2019.\n\n39 See Engel, 32 HRLJ 7–12 (2013), p 449. Various proposals on the enhancement of the Panel’s functioning have also been considered by the Steering Committee for Human Rights (CDDH). In its ‘Draft report on the process of selection and election of judges of the European Court of Human Rights’ (DH-SYSC-I(2017)014 of 5 May 2017), the CDDH drafting group rejected the proposal of making the Panel’s opinions binding, considering that it would be contrary to the Panel’s advisory role. It also considered that the confidentiality of the advice given by the Panel should be preserved; and interaction between the governments and the Panel before reaching the final decision on selection should be enhanced. The same was stressed for the interaction between the Panel and the Assembly’s Committee on the Election of Judges. A possibility of holding interviews by the Panel was not retained.\n\n40 See further CDDH (2017), sections 80–102.\n\n41 Resolution 2002 (2014) of 24 June 2014.\n\n42 In addition, the chairpersons of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights and the Committee on Equality and Non-Discrimination are ex officio members of the AS/Cdh.\n\n43 For the details on the procedure of the election of judges, see CDDH (2017), sections 73–79; and Drzemczewski, 35 HRLJ 1–8 (2015) pp 269–274. See also an overview of the current procedures in Drzemczewski, 55 RGDE (2021).\n\n44 The ‘exceptional circumstances’ exist when all the necessary and appropriate steps have been taken to ensure the gender balance of the list. The ‘exceptional circumstances’ must be so determined by a two-thirds majority of the Committee on the Election of Judges, and whose position subsequently needs to be endorsed by the Assembly. See further the report of the Committee on the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights (AS/Cdh/Inf (2017) 01 rev 6 of 11 October 2017). See also the report of the Assembly’s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights on Resolution 1366 (Doc 9963 of 7 October 2003), which further outlines the general qualities it will look for in a candidate; also the Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers on the Selection of Candidates for the Post of Judge CM (2012)40, and the Explanatory Memorandum (29 March 2012), which are concerned with the national selection process.\n\n45 Advisory Opinion on Certain Legal Questions concerning the Lists of Candidates for the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights No A47-2008-001 (2008) GC. See Mowbray, 8 HRLR 549 (2008).\n\n46 Following the Advisory Opinion, the Assembly changed its rules to permit the above-noted exceptions to the gender requirement, Resolutions 1627 (2008) and 1841 (2011).\n\n47 For the relevant rules of the Assembly, see Appendix to Resolution 1432 (2005).\n\n48 Advisory Opinion (No 2) on Certain Legal Questions concerning the Lists of Candidates Submitted with a View to the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights No A47-2010-001 (2010) paras 45–49 GC.\n\n49 See further CDDH (2017), sections 27–49.\n\n50 See, eg, Marguš v Croatia No 4455/10 (2014) para 11 GC.\n\n51 See also the Court’s Resolution on Judicial Ethics (2021) at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n52 See further section 2.X, pp 131–135.\n\n53 See, eg, the appointment of the judge elected in respect of San Marino to replace the judge elected in respect of Italy in Labita v Italy No 26772/95 (2000) para 4 GC.\n\n54 Article 26(4) as amended by Protocol 14.\n\n55 Rule 29(2).\n\n56 See Rule 29 paras 1(a), (c), and 2(a) and (b). See also Marie-Louise Bemelmans-Videc, Ad Hoc Judges at the European Court of Human Rights: An Overview, PACE Information report, 19 October 2011, Doc 12827.\n\n57 The matter arose in the fourth Cyprus v Turkey inter-state case No 25781/94 para 8 GC, where both the respondent and applicant governments objected to a series of ad hoc judges appointed by the other after the judge elected in respect of Turkey withdrew from sitting in the case and the Turkish Government objected to the judge elected in respect of Cyprus. It appears that, in each case, the decision on whether the national or ad hoc judges were eligible to sit was finally decided by the Grand Chamber in accordance with Rule 28(4). While not expressly provided for by the Convention or Rules of Court, a third party could also object to an ad hoc judge, particularly if it is a state exercising its right to intervene.\n\n58 Behrami and Behrami v France and Saramati v France and 2 Others Nos 71412/01 and 78166/01 (2007) GC. See also Banković and Others v Belgium and 16 Other Contracting States No 52207/99 (2001) DA GC and Senator Lines GmbH v Austria and 14 Other Contracting States No 56672/00, (20040 DA GC; also Artemi and Gregory v 22 Member States of the European Union No 35524/06 (2010) DA.\n\n59 While Article 26 speaks of electing Presidents of Chambers, in practice the plenary Court elects Presidents of Sections, who will in most cases (except when they are the national judge) preside in the chambers of seven judges which are drawn from that Section.\n\n60 Resolution of the European Court of Human Rights on the consequences of the cessation of membership of the Russian Federation to the Council of Europe in light of Article 58 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 22 March 2022.\n\n61 Rule 23(3) of the Rules of Court.\n\n62 See Rules 8 and 25(2). Each Section itself elects its Vice-President, who presides when the President cannot. For example, a President will not preside when a case against their state is being considered.\n\n63 See Rule 24 of the Rules of Court.\n\n64 See p 3.\n\n65 There are currently some 640 staff members of the Registry, approximately half of which are lawyers, and the rest are support staff. Registry employees are staff members of the Council of Europe, the Court’s parent organization, and are subject to the Council of Europe’s Staff Regulations concerning conditions of work and pension entitlement. Approximately half the Registry is employed on contracts of unlimited duration and may be expected to pursue a career in the Registry or in other parts of the Council of Europe. They are recruited on the basis of open competitions. All members of the Registry are required to adhere to strict conditions as to their independence and impartiality and are answerable in practice to the President of the Court rather than to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Following the Interlaken Declaration, states parties were asked to consider the possibility of seconding national judges and other officials to the Registry. The Court selects the candidates from lists supplied by the governments. In addition, the Registry has established cooperation with the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN) providing for long-term training programmes in the Court for judges and prosecutors from the EU countries. The rationale underlying the secondment and long-term training schemes is that the seconded officials will assist the Registry in its work and then return to their countries after one or two years with a greater knowledge of the workings of the Court and its case law. The promotion of temporary secondments to the Registry of the Court was underlined in the Brussels Declaration (p 5) and the Copenhagen Declaration (para 53).\n\n66 Article 26(e) of the Convention and Rules 15 and 16 of the Rules of Court.\n\n67 The Registry’s lawyers are divided into case-processing units, each of which is assisted by an administrative team. Cases are assigned to the different units on the basis of knowledge of the language and legal system concerned. The units are therefore in practice often country-specific. The documents prepared by the Registry for the Court are all drafted in one of its two official languages (English and French).\n\n68 In addition to its case-processing divisions, the Registry has units dealing with the following sectors of activity: information technology; case law information and publications; research and the library; press and public relations; and internal administration. It has a central office, which handles mail, files, and archives. The Court also has a Jurisconsult, who heads the Directorate of the Jurisconsult and keeps the consistency of the case law of the Sections under review. There are two language divisions, whose main work is the language-editing of the produced texts within the Court and translating the Court’s judgments into the second official language.\n\n69 CM Res (2011) 9 amending the Staff Regulations with regard to delegation of staff management powers to the Registrar of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n70 See Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey Nos 46827/99 and 46951/99 (2005) paras 100 and 122 GC.

However, in France and Others v Turkey Nos 9940/82 et al (1983) DA PC, the Commission found, with reference to the objective character of the Convention system, that France was not barred from bringing a case against Turkey, which gave rise to a consideration of issues under Article 15 to which France has entered a reservation.\n\n96 Cyprus v Turkey No 8007/77 (Third Application) (1978) DA PC. The constitutional propriety of the state’s right to bring the complaint was discussed in the first two Cyprus v Turkey cases, Nos 6780/74 and 6950/75 (1975) DA PC. The Commission, in finding that the applicant state had locus standi, based itself on the fact that the government was and continued to be internationally recognized by states and international organizations as the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\n97 Ireland v UK No 5310/71 (1978) paras 239–240 PC and Denmark and Others v Greece Nos 3321/67 et al 12 YB (the Greek case) 134 (1969) Com Rep; CM Res DH (3).\n\n98 In the early days of the Convention system, there were the following inter-state cases: Greece v UK Nos 176/56 and 299/57 Com Rep (1958); CM Res (59) 12 and (59) 32 (emergency laws and regulations concerning Cyprus); Austria v Italy No 788/60 Com Rep (1963), CM Res (63) DH 3 (prosecution of members of the German-speaking minority in South Tyrol); the first Denmark and Others v Greece (Nos 3321/67 et al (1968) Com Rep (1969), CM Res DH (70) 1) and the second (No 4448/70 (1970) DA PC) ‘Greek case’ (various human rights violations under the Greek dictatorship); the first and the second Ireland v UK cases (No 5451/72 (1972) PC and No 5310/71 (1978) PC) concerning the situation in Northern Ireland; Cyprus v Turkey cases (first and second applications) Nos 6780/74 and 6950/75, Com Rep (1976), CM Res DH (79) 1 DA; the third application No 8007/77 Com Rep (1983), CM Res (92) 12 DA; the fourth application (referred to the Court) No 25781/94 Com Rep, 4 June 1999, (2001)GC; 2014 GC) which concerned consequences of the Turkish military intervention in northern Cyprus in 1974; France and Others v Turkey (Nos 9940/82 et al (1983) and (1985) DA) concerning the consequences of the military takeover in Turkey in 1980; and Denmark v Turkey (No 34382/97 (2000)) concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a Danish national. In more recent times, several cases concerned the Russia–Georgia conflict: Georgia v Russia (No 1) No 13255/07 (2014) GC; Georgia v Russia (No 2) No 38263/08 (2021) GC; Georgia v Russia (No 3) No 61186/09; and Georgia v Russia (No 4) No 39611/18. Several cases also related to the Russian invasion in Ukraine: Ukraine v Russia (re Crimea) and Ukraine v Russia (No 7) Nos 20958/14 and 38334/18 (2020) DA GC; Ukraine v Russia (No 2) No 43800/14; Ukraine v Russia (No 3) No 49537/14 (2015) DA; Ukraine v Russia (No 4) No 42410/15; Ukraine and the Netherlands v Russia Nos 8019/16, 43800/14 and 28525/20; Ukraine v Russia (No 8) No 55855/18; Ukraine v Russia (No 9) No 10691/21; Ukraine v Russia (No 10) No 11055/22; and Russia v Ukraine No 36958/21. The Azerbaijani–Armenian conflict has given rise to the following cases: Armenia v Azerbaijan No 42521/20; Azerbaijan v Armenia No 47319/20; and Armenia v Turkey No 43517/20. Other more recent inter-state cases are Slovenia v Croatia No 54155/16 (2020) DA GC (actions of the Croatian judiciary and executive in relation to legal claims brought by the bank Ljubljanska banka d.d.); Latvia v Denmark No 9717/20 (2020) DA (extradition of a Latvia national from Denmark); and Liechtenstein v the Czech Republic No 35738/20 (alleged violation of Liechtenstein nationals’ property rights in the Czech Republic).\n\n99 Rogge, in Hartig, ed, Études à la mémoire de Wolfgang Strasser, 2007, places nine of the cases in this category: Greece v UK No 176/56 (1956) DA; Austria v Italy No 788/60 (1961) DA; Ireland v UK No 5310/71 (1978) PC; Cyprus v Turkey No 25781/94 (2014) GC; to which can be added the Georgia v Russia No 13255/07 (2019) GC, Ukraine v Russia Nos 20958/14 and 38334/18 (2020) DA GC, and Slovenia v Croatia No 54155/16 (2020) DA GC cases.\n\n100 Consider, eg, the Cyprus v Turkey No 25781/94 (2014) GC dispute. The Commission’s report in the first two applications was forwarded to the Committee of Ministers in 1976. The Committee took formal note of the report as well as a memorial of the Turkish Government, urged the parties to resume inter-communal talks, and ‘found that events which occurred in Cyprus constitute violations of the Convention’ without attaching direct responsibility. It took until 31 August 1979 for the case documentation (including the Commission’s report) to be declassified (Resolution DH (79) 1 of 20 January 1979). In the third case, the Commission’s report of 4 October 1983 remained pending before the Committee of Ministers until 2 April 1992, when it was decided to publish it. The Committee of Ministers resolved that the decision to publish completed its consideration of the case under Article 32 (Resolution DH (92) 12).\n\n101 Sargsyan v Azerbaijan No 40167/06 (2015) GC, and Chiragov and Others v Armenia No 13216/05 (2015) GC; both concerning the rights of displaced persons (Armenians and Azerbaijanis, respectively) in the frozen Nagorno–Karabakh conflict. In each of the cases, the government of the other state intervened as a third party.\n\n102 Ljubljanska banka d.d. v Croatia No 29003/07 (2015) DA.\n\n103 The conditions set out in Article 34 are considered in Ch 2, section 6.I, pp 89–90. See also Protocol 16 in this chapter, section 6.III, pp 179–181, which provides for the possibility of advisory opinions requested by national superior courts.\n\n104 This is a requirement for any advisory opinion (see Article 31(b)). The procedure governing advisory opinions is considered separately in section 2.XV, pp 144–145. Denmark v Turkey No 34382/97 (2000) DA was the subject of a settlement adopted by a Chamber (n 98).\n\n105 See, generally, the Practice Direction on the Institution of Proceedings, annexed to the Rules of Court (19 September 2016). Applicants should be diligent in conducting correspondence with the Registry.\n\n106 Rule 34 regulates the use of languages in the procedure before the Court.\n\n107 See Ch 2, section 4, pp 64–70 on the four-month rule.\n\n108 Details such as personal identification information; information on the applicant’s representation; the name of the respondent state; a brief statement of facts and complaints; an explanation as to compliance with the admissibility criteria; the object of the application; and all supporting documents, especially national court decisions and the copies of the remedies used.\n\n109 Rule 47(5) of the Rules of Court.\n\n110 See the Court’s press release of 9 January 2014 setting out the details of the changes. See also the Rules of Court of 6 May 2013 and 1 June and 5 October 2015.\n\n111 In the first year of application of the revised Rule 47, 23 per cent (12,191) of all incoming applications (52,758) failed to comply with the rule. In 2015, 32,400 incoming applications were disposed of administratively, while in 2016 this decreased to 20,950 of the incoming applications. In 2021, 16,400 applications were disposed of administratively, 67 per cent of which for failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 47. See the Court’s statistics, and the Report on the Implementation of the Revised Rule on the Lodging of New Applications (February 2015).\n\n112 See Rule 47(2)(a): ‘All of the information referred to … should be sufficient to enable the Court to determine the nature and scope of the application without recourse to any other document.’\n\n113 There may be an adequate explanation for the failure to present the application in the required form. For example, an applicant who is in detention may not be able to obtain the necessary supporting documentation. A specific exception is made for applicants seeking interim measures. Finally, the Court retains an overriding discretion to accept an application even if not presented in the correct form. Indeed, the Court has stressed that the Rule 47 requirements cannot be raised as the inadmissibility grounds under Article 35 and that, following the communication of the case to the government, the application cannot be rejected for failure to comply with the procedural rules of the Court (Knick v Turkey No 53138/09 (2016) para 36). The above-noted three exceptions, framed in light of real and recurring situations in the Court’s practice, are designed to ensure that the rule does not operate harshly or unjustly. This will concern a minority of new applications. For the great majority, the Registry has been instructed to systematically apply the rule.\n\n114 Protocol 15 reduced the six-month period to four months; see section 6.I, pp 64–70.\n\n115 It would be advisable for applicants to submit their application forms and supporting documents well within the four-month period to allow for the possibility of submitting later amendments to comply with Rule 47.\n\n116 See the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int for further details. For cases dealt with on an urgent basis, see, eg, Pretty v United Kingdom No 2346/02 (2002); Hirsi Jamaa and Others v Italy No 27765/09 (2012) GC; MSS v Belgium and Greece No 30696/09 (2011) GC; Mousiel v France No 67263/01 (2002).\n\n117 Though with a filtering policy that is based on the principle of ‘one-in-one-out’, it is these obviously hopeless cases that will be dealt with first by the single judge before cases belonging to a higher category.\n\n118 Details of the new case-processing strategy are available on the Court’s website (http://www.echr.coe.int).\n\n119 At the time of introduction of the new strategy, 650 cases in category 4 were identified as ‘impact’ cases. By the end of 2021, there were 528 such applications and in that year the Court processed 330 of them. See the Court’s 2021 statistics available on its website (http://www.echr.coe.int).\n\n120 See n 118.\n\n121 The single-judge procedure was introduced by Protocol 14, which came into force on 1 June 2010. For the text of the Protocol and Explanatory Report, see ‘Guaranteeing the effectiveness of the European Convention on Human Rights—Collected Texts’, Council of Europe, 2004. For commentary, see Eaton and Schokkenbroek, 26 HRLJ 1 (2005) and Greer, PL 83 (2005).\n\n122 See Rule 27A. The single-judge formation decided 81,764 cases in 2012, an increase of 74 per cent compared with 2011 (46,930). The increase is due to the introduction of new working methods and to the fact that in 2012 more judges were appointed single judges. For the first time since 1998, the stock of allocated applications pending before the Court decreased over the year, by 16 per cent from 151,600 to 128,100. In 2021, the single‐judge formation decided 27,966 applications. For further statistics, see the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n123 Ölmez and Ölmez v Turkey No 39464/98 (2005) (re-opening decision), and the authorities cited therein; also Edwards v UK No 13071/87 (1989) para 26. The re-opening decision will be taken by the formation that took the original decision.\n\n124 Ölmez and Ölmez v Turkey No 39464/98 (2005).\n\n125 See further the press release issued by the Registrar of the Court (ECHR 180 (2017)) 1 June 2017.\n\n126 See also Rule 27.\n\n127 Article 28(1).\n\n128 While the concept of ‘well-established case law’ (WECL cases) appears to refer to repetitive or clone cases, Article 28 does not limit it to such cases. There are other categories of cases that can be so described, relating, eg, to issues under many Articles of the Convention where the questions of interpretation are the subject of extensive jurisprudence (eg Article 10 cases or cases concerning prison conditions). These are called ‘Broader WECL cases’. The Court has started applying the accelerated WECL procedure to such cases, which are in many ways different from the traditional repetitive cases concerning length of procedure or non-enforcement of a court judgment.\n\n129 See, eg, Taş v Turkey No 702/11 (2017) para 4.\n\n130 Article 28 as amended and Explanatory Report, paras 68–72.\n\n131 See section 2.VI.\n\n132 All judgments and decisions, apart from single-judge decisions, are available on the Court’s Hudoc site. The Court also publishes various analytical documents which can be found on its website, notably the monthly Case-law Information Note (CLIN) and the Overview of the Court’s case law prepared by the Directorate of the Jurisconsult. Until 2015, the important judgments and decisions were published in the Reports of Judgments and Decisions (ECHR series) and online; those for the years 2016 onwards are published online only. They are selected as ‘key cases’ quarterly by the Bureau, upon recommendation by the Jurisconsult. It is also possible to filter Hudoc in order to identify the ‘key cases’.\n\n133 Both the statement of facts and the questions are now available online on the Court’s website (Hudoc, statement of facts collection) at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n134 See further the Court’s Annual Report 2016 (available on the Court’s website).\n\n135 The Chamber can, however, ask for further observations, clarifications, and factual information from either party, as it sees fit.\n\n136 Khlaifia and Others v Italy No 16483/12 (2016) paras 51–54 GC.\n\n137 See Article 29(1), which assumes that admissibility and the merits will be considered together (amendment introduced by Protocol 14). See also Rule 54A on the joint examination of admissibility and merits. Inter-state cases cannot be the subject of the joint procedure since admissibility must be examined separately: Rules 48 and 54A.\n\n138 See section 2.X.\n\n139 See Rule 24 for the regime governing the composition of the Grand Chamber. The President, Vice-Presidents, and Presidents of Sections sit as ex officio members of the Grand Chamber. In a referral case under Article 43, the remaining members are drawn by lot by the President. The members of the Chamber which gave the original judgment are not eligible, apart from the President of the Section and the national judge or any judge who sat in the Chamber which ruled on the admissibility of the application. It often happens in a referral case that the President of the Section (unless he is also the national judge) will not exercise his right to sit in the Grand Chamber for reasons of conscience; having already given judgment in the case, it may be considered inappropriate to sit a second time. Similar rules apply in relinquishment cases (Article 30). On 18 October 2021, the Court changed the earlier version of Rule 24 § 2 which (in sub-paragraph (c)) provided that members of the Chamber that relinquished the case were automatically included in the Grand Chamber. This is now no longer the case. Even in such cases, apart from judges who sit ex officio, the Grand Chamber is completed by the drawing of lots. The modalities for drawing lots to complete the formations have been worked out ‘with due regard to the need for a geographically balanced composition reflecting the different legal systems among the Contracting Parties’ (Rule 24(2)(e)).\n\n140 Before the coming into force of Protocol 15 (1 August 2021), the parties had a month following notification of the intention to relinquish to file a ‘duly reasoned objection’. Where the objection is not duly reasoned, the Court had a power to refuse it, although in practice it happened only once in Grzęda v Poland No 43572/18 (2022) para 7 GC. The coming into force of Protocol 15 removed this veto by the parties. According to Article 8(2) of Protocol 15, the removal of the parties’ veto would not apply to pending cases in which one of the parties had already objected, before entry into force of the Protocol, to a Chamber’s proposal of relinquishment.\n\n141 See Court document The Practice Followed by the Panel of the Grand Chamber when Deciding on Requests for Referral under Article 43 of the Convention (June 2021); available on the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n142 The difference in wording suggests that relinquishment should be limited to cases raising difficult issues of interpretation and where the resolution of a case by the Chamber may result in case law inconsistency. On the other hand, referral can only be sought with regard to cases raising difficult issues of interpretation or a serious issue of general importance, but not in the case of a case law inconsistency introduced by a Chamber judgment. However, a strict compliance with these categories has not been the practice of the Court to date. The Explanatory Report states that the wording was taken from the Rules of Court of the former Court (para 79) but gives no further explanation for the different wording. Relinquishment cases are described as ‘cases with specified serious implications’ (para 46)—wording which is not limitative. See further Schabas, The European Convention on Human Rights: A Commentary, 2015, pp 843–845. See also The Practice Followed by the Panel of the Grand Chamber, n 141, paras 21–23.\n\n143 Paras 17–18.\n\n144 Which Rule provides that it shall be composed of the President of the Court, two Presidents of Sections designated by rotation, two other judges designated by rotation from the remaining Sections, and two further substitute judges, save that it will not include any judge who took part in the consideration of the admissibility and merits of the case and any judge who is elected in respect of or who is a national of the contracting party concerned.\n\n145 In response to demands by states that reasons be given by the Panel, the Court has issued a report which sets out how the Panel procedure operates in practice and the criteria that are employed in its decision-making. The first version of the report (The General Practice Followed by the Panel of the Grand Chamber when Deciding on Requests for Referral in Accordance with Article 43 of the Convention) was issued in 2011 and the report was then updated in June 2021. See n 141. Available on the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int. The call to the Court to reason the decisions by its panel of five judges on refusal of referral requests was reiterated in the Brussels Declaration (p 4).\n\n146 The Practice Followed by the Panel of the Grand Chamber, n 141, paras 2–4.\n\n147 See Arvanitaki-Roboti and Others v Greece No 27278/03 (2006) and No 27278/03 (2008) GC.\n\n148 Öcalan v Turkey No 46221/99 (2005) para 9 GC. See further the Copenhagen Declaration (para 38) on the possibility of support by other states for a referral request.\n\n149 The three months start to run from the day which follows the delivery date of the Chamber judgment: thus, for a judgment delivered on 10 January the time limit expires at midnight on 10 April; see The Practice Followed by the Panel of the Grand Chamber, n 141, para 54. The issue gave rise to a very public dispute with the UK Home Office in connection with the last-minute reference by the applicant’s lawyers in Othman (Abu Qatada) v United Kingdom No 8139/09 (2012); see the Court’s press release concerning the Panel’s refusal of the request on its merits (9 May 2012).\n\n150 See ch 2, section 4.IV.\n\n151 See, eg, Stec and Others v UK Nos 65731/01 and 65900/01 (2006) GC (whether a non-contributory social security benefit came within Article 1 of Protocol 1) and Kopecký v Slovakia No 44912/98 (2004) GC (concerning the meaning of legitimate expectation in the area of property rights).\n\n152 See The Practice Followed by the Panel of the Grand Chamber, n 141, paras 33–34; eg, Pretty v UK No 2346/02 (2002) (concerning refusal of euthanasia to a seriously ill person) and Evans v UK No 6339/05 (2007) GC; (concerning the implantation of embryos and the issue of consent).\n\n153 See Cumpana and Mazare v Romania No 33348/96 (2004) paras 62–69 GC, where one applicant signed the referral request on behalf of both applicants and the Grand Chamber examined the ‘case’ as involving both applicants.\n\n154 Pisano v Italy No 36732/97 (2002) paras 24–29 GC.\n\n155 Ilias and Ahmed v Hungary No 47287/15 (2019) para 177 GC.\n\n156 Odièvre v France No 42326/98 (2003) para 22 GC; Azinas v Cyprus No 56679/00 2004-III; paras 32, 37 GC; Vučković and Others v Serbia Nos 17153/11 et al (2014) para 56 GC.\n\n157 Buzadji v the Republic of Moldova No 23755/07 (2016) paras 62–67 GC.

The inter-state case of Denmark v Turkey was one of the most constructive settlements reached before the Court in terms of the scope of the measures agreed to by the parties; No 34382/97 (2000) para 2. Also, the friendly settlement of France and Others v Turkey Nos 9940/82 et al (1983) DA PC outlining the terms of a settlement whereby Turkey agreed to submit a series of reports on its implementation of Article 3 which would form the basis for a series of dialogues between Turkey and the Commission.

See further the Court’s 2019 Annual Report (p 125) and the Instructions for the applicants concerning the two phases, all available on the Court’s website (http://www.echr.coe.int).\n\n176 In some cases, a friendly settlement proposal is not made: eg if the case raises a novel issue or if some governments do not wish to settle cases in this manner.\n\n177 Following the entry into force of Protocol 14, friendly settlements are now adopted by way of a decision striking the case off the list. In 2011, there were 606 friendly settlements, and 1,303 in 2012. In 2021, there were 2,174 friendly settlements, which is an increase of 58 per cent in comparison to 2020 (1,375 settlements); see Analysis of Statistics on the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n178 See, eg, Paladi v Moldova No 39806/05 (2007); Ukrainian Media Group v Ukraine No 72713/01 (2005).

The government had inter alia admitted liability in respect of a killing by the security forces and offered to pay £85,000 in compensation. The Court took into account not only the admissions and undertakings made by the government, but also the fact that it had previously specified in numerous cases the nature and extent of the obligations which arise for states concerning killings by the security forces. Criticism has focused on the fact that the compensation was paid ex gratia (notwithstanding the admission) and that no proper investigation had been carried out by the authorities. For critical comment on such decisions, see Sardaro, 6 EHRLR 601 (2003). Where the applicant expresses his agreement to a unilateral declaration, this will be considered a friendly settlement; Cēsnieks v Latvia No 9278/06 (2012).

The granting of a permanent residence permit to the applicant following the referral of the Chamber judgment to the Grand Chamber would have the same effect (eg ME v Sweden No 71398/12 (2015) GC and WH v Sweden No 49341/10 (2015) GC).\n\n196 See Sisojeva, ibid paras 104 and 105 ff (striking out the application insofar as it related to Article 8 and continuing its examination in relation to the Article 34 complaint).\n\n197 See Akman v Turkey No 37453/97 (2001); Pisano v Italy No 36732/97 (2002) para 41 GC; and Ohlen v Denmark No 63214/00 (2005) para 25.\n\n198 El Majjaoui and Stichting Touba Moskee v Netherlands No 25525/03 (2007) para 30 GC.\n\n199 See Ch 2, section 6.I, pp 88–89 on victim status.\n\n200 Matter considered resolved following a lead pilot judgment: Association of Real Property Owners in Łódź v Poland No 3485/02 (2011); Dalban v Romania No 28114/95 (1999) paras 41–45 GC; Burdov v Russia No 59498/00 (2002) paras 27–32; Ohlen v Denmark No 63214/00 (2005) para 26.

The correctness of such an approach may be called into question given that Rule 80 allows for a possibility of revision only in case of a ‘discovery of a fact … which, when a judgment was delivered, was unknown to the Court’.\n\n212 No 2614/65 (1973).\n\n213 No 15175/89 (1996) 557.

Rules 87, 88, and 89 of the Court refer to the concept of a ‘reasoned decision’ for decisions taken pursuant to Article 48 on whether a request for an advisory opinion is within the Court’s competence. This was the first such decision. It was adopted on 2 June 2004.\n\n225 Advisory Opinion on Certain Legal Questions concerning the Lists of Candidates for the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights No A 47-2008-001 (2008) GC.\n\n226 Advisory Opinion (No 2) on Certain Legal Questions concerning the Lists of Candidates Submitted with a View to the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights No A 47-2010-001 (2010) GC. The Court also found that it had no jurisdiction to consider the compatibility with the Convention of provisions of a PACE resolution; see n 206, para 36.\n\n227 No oral hearing has yet been held. The opinion of 12 February 2008 involved a written procedure in which each contracting party, as well as PACE, were given an opportunity to file written observations. It does not appear that the Convention makes any provision for third-party interventions by NGOs in advisory opinion proceedings. Article 36 of the Convention covering such interventions speaks only of ‘cases’ and so appears only to contemplate inter-state cases and individual applications. However, support for the right to seek leave to intervene may be found in Rule 82, which allows the Court to apply other provisions of the Rules of Court to the extent it considers this to be appropriate, and this may allow for such interventions in application of Rule 44. Indeed, in the context of the Oviedo Convention Advisory Opinion procedure, where the Court applied the Chapter IX of the Rules of Court procedure per analogiam, it also granted leave to several third-party interveners (see Decision on the competence of the Court to give an advisory opinion under Article 29 of the Oviedo Convention No A 47-2021-001 (2021) paras 3 and 5 GC).\n\n228 ETS No 164. Article 29 provides as follows:\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights may give, without direct reference to any specific proceedings pending in a court, advisory opinions on legal questions concerning the interpretation of the present Convention at the request of:\n\n–\n\nthe Government of a Party, after having informed the other Parties;\n\n–\n\nthe Committee set up by Article 32, with membership restricted to the Representatives of the Parties to this Convention, by a decision adopted by a two-thirds majority of votes cast.\n\n229 The Court’s judges may also be invited to sit on the European Tribunal established under to the Additional Protocol to the European Convention on State Immunity 1972 ETS No 74A.\n\n230 Decision on the competence of the Court to give an advisory opinion under Article 29 of the Oviedo Convention No A 47-2021-001 (2021) GC.\n\n231 Rule 33. In keeping with the philosophy of transparency underlying Protocol 11 setting up the new Court, all documents will also be accessible to the public unless the President decides otherwise for good cause: Rule 33(2). Arrangements can be made at the Registry for the public or journalists to inspect such documents—see the Court’s website for details at: http://www.echr.coe.int. It is the Court’s policy that documents must be consulted at the seat of the Court.\n\n232 See para 3 of Practice Direction of 14 January 2010 on Requests for Anonymity (Rules 33 and 47).\n\n233 Practice Direction of 14 January 2010 on Requests for Anonymity, paras 4 and 5.\n\n234 See generally, Rule 36(1)–(5).\n\n235 Rule 36(4)(b). For a decision to refuse a lawyer permission to appear, see Manoussos v Czech Republic and Germany No 46468/99 (2002) DA. Even if a lawyer is no longer able to practise in their own country, they could still be authorized by the President, who has full discretion to evaluate all the circumstances to represent an applicant.\n\n236 See, eg, Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v Ireland Nos 14234/88 and 14235/88 (1992) PC; and Kamasinski v Austria No 9783/82 (1989).\n\n237 In X v Croatia No 11223/04 (2008), paras 2 and 61), where the applicant was a person entirely divested of the capacity to act and was not capable under domestic law of choosing her own legal representative, the Court indicated to the government under Rule 39 that a lawyer should be appointed to represent the applicant in the proceedings before it, following which a lawyer was appointed by the relevant welfare centre.\n\n238 Rule 36(3).\n\n239 Shanidze v Georgia No 56080/10 (2015) paras 21–23 DA. See, by contrast, Melnik v Ukraine No 72286/01 (2006) paras 56–57.\n\n240 Terentyev v Russia No 25147/09 (2017) para 32.\n\n241 Rule 101.\n\n242 National legal aid schemes rarely offer legal aid for Strasbourg proceedings. The Danish Legal Aid Act (1999) is an exception; see Vasileva v Denmark No 52792/99 (2003) para 50.\n\n243 Rule 102(2).\n\n244 The payment of legal aid is regulated by Chapter XI of the Rules of Court.\n\n245 Rule 63. The public may be excluded ‘in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interest of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require’; see Rule 63(2). In camera hearings have been rare but have taken place in a number of cases where the rights of children were at stake: Z v Finland No 22009/93 (1997); before the Chamber in K and T v Finland No 25702/94 (2000); and L v Finland No 25651/94 (2000).\n\n246 See the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int for an archive of oral hearing webcasts. Webcasting of hearings is not live and will take place in the afternoon of the hearing following a favourable decision of the Chamber.\n\n247 See, eg, Abdi Ibrahim v Norway No 15379/16 (2021) para 12 GC.\n\n248 See Guidelines on Hearings by Videoconference; available on the Court’s website: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n249 In recent years, there were only two Chamber hearings in 2017: both were held before a Chamber of the First Section. The first was held in May in the case Sharxhi and Others v Albania No 10613/16 (2018), and the second was held in November concerning the cases Big Brother Watch and Others v United Kingdom Nos 58170/13 et al (2018), Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Alice Ross v United Kingdom No 62322/14 (2015), and 10 Human Rights Organisations and Others v the United Kingdom No 24960/15 (2015), and in 2018 there was a hearing before the Second Section in Ahmet Tunç and Others v Turkey Nos 4133/16 and 31542/16 (2019) DA and Elçi v Turkey No 63129/15 (2019) DA.\n\n250 See, eg, the United Kingdom’s oral submissions in Saadi v Italy No 37201/06 (2008) GC.\n\n251 Article 36(3). His written and oral interventions have been very few and this for reasons of policy and staff resources. See, eg, MSS v Belgium and Greece No 30696/09 (2011) GC.

See, for statistics concerning interim measures, the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int. Expulsion under the Dublin Regulations also gave rise to large numbers of requests being made during this period; see MSS v Belgium and Greece No 30696/09 (2011) GC. To ensure consistency, the handling of requests has been centralized within the Court and decisions are taken by a duty judge specially appointed by the President: Rule 39(4).\n\n255 See the Statement on Requests for Interim Measures issued by the President on 11 February 2011, doc GT-GDR-C(2012)005.\n\n256 See, for an early example, the indication of the old Court that extradition be deferred while Strasbourg proceedings were pending in Soering v UK No 14038/88 (1989) PC.\n\n257 Cruz Varas and Others v Sweden No 15576/89 (1991) PC.\n\n258 Nos 46827/99 and 46951/99 (2005) GC.

For other examples of non-compliance in deportation/extradition cases leading to a violation of Article 34, see Shamayev and Others v Georgia and Russia No 36378/02 (2005), concerning the extradition of Chechen applicants from Georgia to Russia; Mostafa and Others v Turkey No 16348/05 (2008); Muminov v Russia (no violation) No 42502/06 (2008); Ben Khemais v Italy No 246/07 (2009); Trabelsi v Italy No 50163/08 (2010); Mannai v Italy No 9961/10 (2012); Labsi v Slovakia (expulsion to Algeria) No 33809/08 (2012); and Abdulkhakov v Russia (kidnapping and secret transfer to Tajikistan) No 14743/11 (2012).

The Court took the further step of asking the Turkish authorities to delay the detention of a number of applicants who had Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, at least until they had been examined by a team of medical experts and a delegation of judges sent by the Court: Gürbüz v Turkey No 26050/04 (2005) and Tekin Yildiz v Turkey No 22913/04 (2005). In Ensslin and Others No 7572/76 (1978) DA, the former Commission also invoked Rule 36 (as it then was) to send a delegation prior to admissibility to Stammheim prison, Stuttgart, to investigate the alleged suicides of the applicants. In admissible cases, such a step would now be taken pursuant to Article 38 of the Convention—see section 3.VI, pp 153–156 on fact-finding.\n\n264 Aleksanyan v Russia No 46468/06 (2008); the Court requested the authorities to secure treatment in a specialized hospital for an inmate suffering from AIDS; also Makharadze and Sikharulidze v Georgia No 35254/07 (2011).\n\n265 Öcalan v Turkey No 46221/99 (2005) GC; see press release of 30 November 1999.\n\n266 Ilascu and Others v Moldova and Russia No 48787/99 (2004) paras 10 and 11 GC.\n\n267 Eg Klimov v Russia No 54436/14 (2016) para 5.\n\n268 Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey Nos 46827/99 and 46951/99 (2005) para 6 GC.\n\n269 Eg D v UK No 30240/96 (1997); N v UK No 26565/05 (2008) GC; Paposhvili v Belgium No 41738/10 (2016) para 3 GC.\n\n270 See the Press release ‘Requests for interim measures concerning the situation at the borders with Belarus’, ECHR 372 (2021), 6 December 2021.\n\n271 No 39806/05 (2009) GC; Prezec v Croatia (unilateral declaration by the government) No 7508/05 (2008); Tehrani and Others v Turkey Nos 32940/08 et al (2010); see also Salakhov Islyamova v Ukraine No 28005/08 (2013).\n\n272 Othman (Abu Qatada) v United Kingdom No 8139/09 (2012); allegation that the applicant would be tried on the basis of statements by co-accused adduced through torture and that he would thus be subject to a flagrant violation of Article 6; see Soering v United Kingdom No 14038/88 (1989) para 113 PC.\n\n273 Hague Convention on International Child Abduction (1980); Neulinger and Shuruk v Switzerland No 41615/07 (2010) GC; B v Belgium No 4320/11 (2012).\n\n274 No 46221/99 (2005) GC.

The Court has become a reluctant in situ fact-finder. See, for discussion of the reasons for this, O’Boyle and Brady, 4 EHRLR 378–391 (2013). Chernishova and Vajić note that remarkably there has not yet been a fact-finding in any Russian case concerning the events in the Northern Caucasus region of Russia, notwithstanding the seriousness of the allegations being examined and the large number of judgments in Article 2 and 3 cases against Russia: Chernishova and Vajić, Mélanges Christos L Rozakis, 2011, pp 64–65. A fact-finding took place in Strasbourg in the ‘secret rendition’ cases of Al Nashiri v Poland No 28761/11 (2012) and Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v Poland No 7511/13 (2013), press release of 3 December 2013. The most recent fact-finding took place in Strasbourg in June 2016 in the Georgia v Russia (II) No 38263/08 (2021) GC) case.\n\n290 See, as regard both points, Tanlı v Turkey No 26129/95 (2001).

The President of the Chamber may grant leave to third parties to take part in an investigative measure, although this has not yet occurred (Rule A1(6)).\n\n300 Rule A2(2). This rule should be read in conjunction with Rule 44A, which imposes a general duty on the parties to cooperate fully with the Court. See also Rules 44B and C.\n\n301 For a detailed account of such instances, see the Report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Assembly, Pourgourides, Member States’ Duty to Co-operate with the European of Human Rights paras 18 ff, 9 February 2007.\n\n302 Rule A4(2).\n\n303 Rule A1(5).\n\n304 Rule A7(1–5).\n\n305 Rule A7(5).\n\n306 Rule A7(3).\n\n307 Rule A8.

The Court drew adverse inferences in this case as well as finding a breach of Article 38(1)(a).

Since under the former system the fact-finding had been carried out by the Commission, this approach is understandable. But it was inevitable that the new Court, which must establish the facts for itself, would develop a different approach to the burden of proof.\n\n315 Selmouni v France No 25803/94 (1999) para 87 GC and the authorities cited therein. See also Ch 2, section 3.III, pp 56–57.\n\n316 Nachova and Others v Bulgaria Nos 43577/98 and 43579/98 (2005) para 147 GC.\n\n317 Saadi v Italy No 37201/06 (2008) para 129 GC and N v Finland No 38885/02 (2005) para 167. In this context, the principle of ‘the benefit of the doubt’ in favour of asylum seekers applies. However, an asylum seeker will discharge the burden of proof only if they provide a substantiated account of an individual, and thus a real risk of ill-treatment upon deportation. When this has been done, it is for the government to look into ‘the objective situation in the country of origin concerned’ proprio motu. The fact of past ill-treatment provides a strong indication of a future real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3, in cases in which an applicant has made a generally coherent and credible account of events that is consistent with information from reliable and objective sources about the general situation in the country at issue. In such circumstances, it will be for the government to dispel any doubts about that risk. Similar considerations apply in cases concerning asylum seekers belonging to a targeted group in the country of origin (see JK and Others v Sweden No 59166/12 (2016) paras 91–105 GC).\n\n318 For a good summary of the case law, see El-Masri v the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia No 39630/09 (2012) paras 154–167 GC; also Ch 6, section 3.I, pp 249–250.\n\n319 Kurt v Turkey No 24276/94 (1998) para 124 and Çakıcı v Turkey No 23657/94 (1999) GC.\n\n320 Ağdaş v Turkey No 34592/97 (2004).\n\n321 See Ch 11, section 3, pp 516–520.\n\n322 Nachova v Bulgaria Nos 43577/98 and 43579/98 (2005) para 157 GC.\n\n323 See, eg, DH and Others v Czech Republic No 57325/00 (2007) paras 186–189 GC.\n\n324 Merabishvili v Georgia No 72508/13 (2017) paras 310 and 314 GC.\n\n325 First employed in Ireland v UK No 5310/71 (1978) PC.

It ‘envisages a practice whereby in relation to clearly repetitive cases the Registry would simply refer a list of cases directly to the government to be settled in an appropriate way. In the absence of any justified objections from the government, failure to provide redress within a fixed period of time would lead to a “default judgment” awarding compensation to the applicant’.

For a practical Guide on third-party interventions, see ENNHRI, Third Party Interventions Before the European Court of Human Rights: Guide for National Human Rights Institutions, 2020, available at: http://www.ennhri.org.\n\n352 This is made easier by the Court’s decision to publish details of most communicated cases on its website, as well as cases accepted for reference to the Grand Chamber by the panel and cases where jurisdiction has been relinquished to the Grand Chamber. See ‘Communicated Cases Collection’ at hudoc.\n\n353 See, eg, the Russian Government’s intervention in Slivenko v Latvia No 48321/99 (2003) GC (concerning the rights of Russian-speaking settled immigrants to regular residence status); or the Cypriot Government’s intervention in Eugenia Michaelidou Developments Ltd and Michael Tymvios v Turkey No 16163/90 (2003); (concerning access to property in northern Cyprus); and the intervention by the Government of Serbia and Montenegro (as it then was) in Markovic v Italy No 1398/03 (2006) GC (concerning the unsuccessful attempts of Serbian nationals to obtain compensation through the Italian courts for an air strike by NATO).\n\n354 See, eg, GJ v Luxembourg No 21156/93 (2000); Krombach v France No 29731/96 (2001); and Fogarty v UK No 37112/97 (2001) GC, where, respectively, the Danish, German, and Irish Governments declined to intervene.\n\n355 The Court has given a wide meaning to the notion of ‘any person concerned who is not the applicant’ in Rule 44(2). It encompasses not only individuals and NGOs, but also government-appointed human rights bodies, such as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. The Council of Europe’s Venice Commission has also been given leave on various occasions (Sejdić and Finci v Bosnia and Herzegovina Nos 27996/06 and 34836/06 (2009) GC; Jeličić v Bosnia and Herzegovina (No 41183/02 (2005) DA). Article 36(3) confers on the Commissioner of Human Rights a right to intervene. If the Commissioner has so far exercised this power sparingly, it can be explained by a certain tension between his traditional statutory role and involvement in cases brought against countries on whose cooperation he depends. See the Commissioner’s website at: http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner for cases where he has intervened. A judicious use of the Commissioner’s right to intervene under the Protocol has been already shown to be beneficial to the Court since his specific knowledge of the human rights situation in particular countries, nourished by his contacts with national human rights institutions, place him in a strategic position, especially in pilot cases relating to systemic problems. See MSS v Belgium and Greece No 30696/09 (2011) GC. Permission has also been granted to the UN Commissioner for Human Rights (El-Masri v The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia No 39630/09 (2012) GC) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (Hirsi Jamaa and Others v Italy No 27765/09 (2012) GC). The Court has not yet decided the general question whether it would be open to a non-state party to intervene in proceedings. In Nizomkhon Dzhurayev v Russia No 31890/11 (2012) (Article 3 case concerning forcible transfer, communicated in 2012), Tajikistan was refused permission by the Section to intervene. It remains to be seen whether permission would be given, eg, to the Council of Europe monitoring bodies such as ECRI or the European Committee of Social Rights or the CPT. It can be argued that the Court is able to have recourse to their reports when examining cases, so intervention is not necessary. PACE has not yet sought to intervene, but in the El-Masri case the President refused permission to the Rapporteur on extraordinary renditions (Dick Marty), whose reports were eventually used by the Court to establish the facts in the case.\n\n356 The UK has been a frequent intervener on this ground. See, eg, its interventions in Association SOS Attentats and De Boëry v France No 76642/01 (2006) GC (in support of the contention that heads of state in office enjoyed immunity ratione personae from civil and criminal proceedings); Kyprianou v Cyprus No 73797/01 (2005) GC (contempt of court); Bosphorus Hava Yollari Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (Bosphorus Airways) v Ireland No 45036/98 (2005) GC (concerning the appropriate level of review to be applied by the Court when the alleged violation results from a state’s legal obligations flowing from membership in another international organization, in this case the European Union). The Copenhagen Declaration placed emphasis on third-party interventions by states parties (paras 38–40).\n\n357 Denmark, Estonia, Poland, Portugal, and the UK.\n\n358 Saadi v Italy No 37201/06 (2008) GC, where the UK Government intervened to argue that the Court should overturn its view in Chahal that, in expulsion cases under Article 3, considerations relating to national security were not to be taken into account once a substantial risk of ill-treatment was established.\n\n359 No 46410/99 (2006) GC.\n\n360 No 27510/08 (2015) GC.\n\n361 Adali v Turkey No 38187/97 (2005). The applicant, the widow of the deceased, was a Turkish national and the Cypriot Government intervened in support of her.\n\n362 Nos 24724/94 and 24888/94 (1999) GC.\n\n363 No 48898/99 (2003) GC.\n\n364 See, eg, Nikula v Finland No 31611/96 (2002) (intervention by Interights); Hugh Jordan v UK No 24746/94 (2001) (intervention by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission); Pretty v UK No 2346/02 (2002) (intervention by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England).

In Andrejeva v Latvia No 55707/00 (2009) GC, the Court invited the Russian and Ukrainian Governments to intervene, the applicant having worked in both countries. The issue concerned a pension dispute. The invitation was not accepted.\n\n372 Nos 71412/01 and 78166/01 (2007) GC.\n\n373 See the Court’s Practice Direction on just satisfaction claims (28 March 2007) for a summary of the principles that govern, available on the Court’s website at: http://www.echr.coe.int.\n\n374 For commentaries on the Court’s practice, see Shelton, Remedies in International Human Rights Law, 2nd edn, 2005, pp 294 ff and 3rd edn, 2015, pp 205 ff; Bernhardt, Schachter Collection, p 243; Costa, in Fairgrieve et al, eds, Tort Liability of Public Authorities in Comparative Perspective, 2002; Myjer, in Vandenberghe et al, eds, Property and Human Rights, 2006; Leach, Taking a Case to the European Court of Human Rights, 2nd edn, 2005, pp 397 ff, and 4th edn, 2017, pp 598 ff; Loucaides, 2 EHRLR 182 (2008); and Reid, A Practitioners Guide to the ECHR, 4th edn, 2012, pp 841–847 and 850. For a highly critical view of the case law on Article 41, see Tavernier, 72 RDH 945 (2007).\n\n375 Generally, where there are multiple applicants, the Court has indicated that the awards to each applicant should be lower, although it has also indicated that in a particular case there might also be elements that justified a higher award. For the Court, the fact that a single set of proceedings with a shared objective had been brought alleviated the inconvenience and uncertainty experienced on account of the delay and so meant a reduction in the amount of the award: Arvanitaki-Roboti and Others v Greece No 27278/03 (2008) GC (91 applicants complaining of length of civil proceedings) paras 29–32. Also, Selahattin Çetinkaya and Others v Turkey No 31504/02 (2009), where a joint sum was awarded to a large number of applicants who were heirs to the original party to the national proceedings.\n\n376 This was also recommended by the Woolf Report (the Review of the Working Methods of the European Court of Human Rights, December 2005).

There are exceptions to this rule. In a series of Italian cases concerning prolonged inability to secure the eviction of tenants from the applicants’ flats, the Court stressed that the breach of the Convention by the state was of a procedural nature and that any pecuniary damage stemmed from the tenants’ unlawful conduct. The Court thus considered that a possibility of bringing an action in the civil courts against the applicants’ former tenants for any damage caused by their conduct, and against the state for its failure to secure evictions, was the most appropriate means of reparation. It therefore rejected the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction (eg Lo Tufo v Italy No 64663/01 (2005) paras 66–69). See also Denisova and Moiseyeva v Russia No 16903/03 (2011).\n\n379 Burdov v Russia No 33509/04 (2009) para 156; Oyal v Turkey No 4864/05 (2010); Mikheyev v Russia No 77617/01 (2006) para 155.\n\n380 Papamichalopoulos and Others v Greece No 14556/89 (1995) para 34.\n\n381 Scozzari and Giunta v Italy Nos 39221/98 and 41963/98 (2000) paras 248–250 GC.\n\n382 See, eg, Vistiņŝ and Perepjolkins v Latvia No 71243/01 (2012) GC and, as regards just satisfaction, see ibid No 71243/01 (2014) GC.\n\n383 Rule 75(4).

On the other hand, in Association ‘21 December 1989’ and Others v Romania Nos 33810/07 and 18817/08 (2011) para 202, the Court indicated under Article 41 that the respondent state must take the necessary measures to expedite the investigations into the murder of the applicants’ relative.\n\n389 Rule 60 is supplemented by the Practice Direction on just satisfaction claims (28 March 2007).\n\n390 See, eg, Nasri v France No 19465/92 (1995) para 49. See Rule 60 of the Rules of Court. This should not be confused with a situation in which an applicant makes a non-pecuniary claim but fails to specify it. In such instances, if the Court finds that they have sustained non-pecuniary damage, it is entitled to make an appropriate award (eg Ābele v Latvia Nos 60429/12 and 72760/12 (2017) paras 84–86).\n\n391 Nagmetov v Russia No 35589/08 (2017) paras 74–82 GC.\n\n392 See, eg, Lapshin v Azerbaijan No 13527/18 (2021) para 129; A and B v Georgia No 73975/16 (2022) para 59.\n\n393 See, eg, in Sahin v Germany No 30943/96 (2003) para 105 GC and Adam v Romania No 45890/05 (2009).

Cf Paez v Sweden No 29482/95 (1997), where the former Court struck out an Article 3 case concerning expulsion to Peru after the applicant had been allowed to stay in Sweden and after extensive examination of the case by the Commission which expressed the view that there would be no violation in sending him back. At that time, the rules did not allow an award in such circumstances.\n\n400 See Reid, A Practitioners Guide to the ECHR, 6th edn, 2019, chs 85 and 86, for detailed tables of awards made by the Court for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss.\n\n401 Imakayeva v Russia No 7615/02 (2006) para 213; Çakıcı v Turkey No 23657/94 (1999) para 127 GC.\n\n402 Lustig-Prean and Beckett v UK Nos 31417/96 and 32377/96 (2000); Young and Others v UK Nos 7601/76 and 7806/77 (1982) para 11.\n\n403 No 4864/05 (2010) (€300,000 pecuniary damages and €78,000 non-pecuniary damages).\n\n404 See, eg, Beyeler v Italy No 33202/96 (2002) GC; Brumărescu v Romania No 28342/95 2001-IGC; Iatridis v Greece (Art 41) No 31107/96 2000-XI GC; James and Others v UK No 8793/79 (1986) PC; Lithgow and Others v UK Nos 9006/80 et al (1986) PC; Papamichalopoulos and Others v Greece No 14556/89 (1995).\n\n405 See, eg, in Former King of Greece and Others v Greece No 25701/94 (2002) GC (see also the principal judgment No 25701/94 (2000), about the expropriation of the former king’s properties after his deposition; the final award ran to over €13 million).\n\n406 Former King of Greece, ibid para 87.\n\n407 No 58858/00 (2009) paras 98–107 GC.\n\n408 See, eg, Bukovčanová and Others v Slovakia No 23785/07 (2016) para 51.\n\n409 Former King of Greece and Others v Greece No 25701/94 (2002) GC, para 73; Beyeler v Italy No 33202/96 (2002) GC (just satisfaction).\n\n410 Pasculli v Italy No 36818/97 (2007).\n\n411 The case law for loss of opportunity is not always consistent, eg, Bönisch v Austria No 8658/79 (1986); Weeks v UK No 9787/82 (1988) para 13 PC; and H v UK No 9580/81 (1988) PC, where awards under this head were made. In other cases, the Court has refused to speculate whether there were such losses: see, eg, Perks and Others v UK Nos 25277/94 et al (1999), where the applicant was unrepresented before a magistrates’ court which sentenced him to a prison term.\n\n412 Eg awards in Russian cases, for a substantive violation of Article 2 (disappearance) coupled with violations of Articles 5 and 13 are around €60,000: Alpatu Israilova v Russia No 15438/05 (2013); Vakhayeva v Russia No 27368/07 (2012); Ilayeva and Others v Russia No 27504/07 (2012); Umarova and Others v Russia No 25654/08 (2012); also Bitiyeva and X v Russia Nos 57953/00 and 37392/03 (2007) (the death of four family members gave rise to an award of €85,000). In Mikheyev v Russia No 77617/01 (2006), the Court awarded €120,000 in respect of a brutal torture which left the applicant paralysed. In Abuyeva v Russia No 27065/05 (2010), which concerned the deaths of 24 relatives caused by the shelling of a village in Chechnya, the Court awarded €1.72 million.\n\n413 No 7334/13 (2016) para 181 GC.\n\n414 Mozharov and Others v Russia Nos 16401/12 et al (2017) para 14.\n\n415 See Centro Europa 7 SRL and Di Stefano v Italy No 38433/09 (2012) GC; Rock Ruby Hotels Ltd v Turkey (just satisfaction) No 46159/99 (2010).\n\n416 See, eg, IK v Austria No 2964/12 (2013); Barborski v Bulgaria No 12811/07 (2013), where a period of detention found unlawful by the Court had been deducted from the remainder of the sentence. This approach is now uncommon. It can be said that there is almost a presumption that an award will be made, even in cases involving terrorism: A and Others v United Kingdom No 3455/05 (2009) GC. Making no award has come in for robust criticism by some of the judges, eg Judge Bonello’s partly dissenting opinion in Nikolova v Bulgaria No 31195/96 (1999) GC.\n\n417 For Article 5, see Thompson v UK No 36256/97 (2004) para 50"
