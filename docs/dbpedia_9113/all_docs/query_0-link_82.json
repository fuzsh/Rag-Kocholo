        "text": "Algeria\n\nElectricity industry overview\n\nIn 2017, 71,470 GWh of electricity was generated in Algeria.\n\nThis was comprised of:\n\n10,074 GWh from thermal steam (14,09%);\n\n31,009 GWh from thermal gas (43,39%);\n\n29,508 GWh from combined cycle (41,29%);\n\n71 GWh from hydraulic (0,01%);\n\n286 GWh from diesel (0,4%);\n\n21 GWh from wind (0,029%); and\n\n500 GWh from photovoltaic solar (0,70%).\n\nElectricity laws\n\nIn the early 2000s, institutional reforms brought about significant changes in the electricity and gas distribution sector in Algeria. They led to the promulgation of Law 02-01 of 5 February 2002 relating to electricity and gas distribution through pipelines, the main objectives of which were reorganize the national electricity and gas distribution market by recommending:\n\nA restructuring of the operator;\n\nThe separation of electricity and gas activities;\n\nThe opening up of electricity production and energy marketing activities to public and private investors in order to promote the emergence of benchmark competition;\n\nThe modernization of the public service and the improvement of the performance of operators in the sector; and\n\nA consumer protection framework.\n\nIn order to ensure the effective implementation of these new reforms, Law 02-01 provided for the creation of a national regulatory authority whose main missions are:\n\nMonitoring and control of public services;\n\nAdvising the public authorities on the organization and operation of the electricity and national gas markets;\n\nDetermining the remuneration of operators;\n\nDetermining the pricing of energy products (electricity and gas) for end consumers; and\n\nThe supervision and control over the laws and regulations relating to it.\n\nThe establishment of the Electricity and Gas Regulatory Commission (CREG), whose Management Committee was set up on 24 January 2005, was intended to ensure the conformity of the implementation of the transformation process of the electricity and gas sector with the provisions of Law 02-01.\n\nGeneration and distribution\n\nGeneration\n\nThe national production fleet is made up of power plants owned by Société Algérienne de Production de l'Électricité (SPE), and Shariket Kahraba wa Taket Moutadjadida (SKTM), which are subsidiaries of Sonelgaz, as well as companies in partnership with Sonelgaz:\n\nKahrama Arzew, which came into service in 2005;\n\nShariket Kahraba Skikda \"SKS\" which came into service in 2006;\n\nShariket Kahraba Berrouaghia \"SKB\" (Médéa) which came into service in 2007;\n\nShariket Kahraba Hadjret Ennouss \"SKH\" which entered into service in 2009;\n\nSPP1 which entered into service in 2010;\n\nShariket Kahraba Terga \"SKT\" commissioned in 2012; and\n\nShariket Kahraba de Koudiet Edraouch \"SKD\" commissioned in 2013.\n\nIn 2017, generation was comprised of:\n\nSPE (67%);\n\nSKD (6%);\n\nSKT (6%);\n\nSKH (6%);\n\nSKTM (6%);\n\nSKS (4%);\n\nSKB (3%);\n\nKahrama (2%);\n\nSPP1 (1%).\n\nDistribution\n\nThe development program for electricity generation and transmission is accompanied by the reinforcement of the distribution network to ensure the reliability of the supply and distribution of electrical energy and guarantee a better quality of service.\n\nAt the end of 2017, the total length of the national electricity distribution network was 328,996 km.\n\nAlgeria\n\nRenewables law\n\nDespite the enactment of Law No. 04-09 of August 14, 2004, on the promotion of renewable energies in the framework of sustainable development, no concrete governmental decision to promote renewable energies has been taken since.\n\nRenewable industry overview\n\nIn 2018, Algeria's energy mix was composed approximately of 1% liquid petroleum gas (LPG), 20% oil products and 79% gas.\n\nDespite the establishment of a national programme dedicated to the development of renewable energy, the program's implementation schedule was never followed. Out of all the pilot projects totalling the 110 MW planned, only three projects were carried out, with a total capacity of 36.3 MW:\n\nThe Hassi-Rmel hybrid plant (gas and solar thermal), with 25 MW of concentrated solar power (CSP) (commissioned in 2011);\n\nThe 1.1 MW photovoltaic (PV) solar plant in Ghardaïa, including all four PV technologies, with and without solar tracking (commissioned in 2014); and\n\nThe 10.2 MW wind power plant in Kabertène (Adrar), comprising 12 wind turbines with a rated power of 850 KW each (commissioned in 2014).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, power plants were installed mainly in cities located in southern Algeria (Adrar, Illizi, Tamanrasset, Djelfa, Laghouat) for a production capacity of 343 MW.\n\nIn 2019, the Commissariat aux Energies Renouvelables et à l'Efficacité Energétique (CEFERE) was created by Executive Decree No. 19-280 of 20 October 2019 on the creation, organization and operation of the Commission for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.\n\nThe CEFERE is responsible for contributing to national and sectoral development of renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nAlgeria\n\nIncentive measures\n\nThe Ministry of Energy has adopted a series of support measures aimed at the development of grid-connected renewable energies, through the establishment of a favorable legal framework and a National Fund for Energy Management, Renewable Energies and Cogeneration, CAS n°302-131 (FNMEERC) which is fed annually by 1% of oil royalties and the proceeds of certain taxes (such as 55% of the tax on flaring activities).\n\nThe legal framework, put in place in 2013, during the first phase of the launch of the national renewable energy development program was based on a Feed-in Tariff mechanism, which is less and less used in developed countries.\n\nThis system guarantees renewable energy producers benefit from tariffs that give them a reasonable return on their investment over a 20-year eligibility period.\n\nThe additional costs generated by these tariffs will be borne by the FNMEERC as diversification costs.\n\nIn this context, the executive decree n°15-319, amended and completed, setting the modalities of operation of the CAS 302-131 was published in December 2015.\n\nAlso, other incentive measures are planned. These include:\n\nAcquisition and provision of eligible land for the establishment of renewable energy plants;\n\nSupport in the entire permit acquisition process;\n\nIdentification of the renewable energy potential of the country’s eligible administrative regions;\n\nConstruction of pilot projects in each sector;\n\nCreation of bodies and entities for the approval and control of the quality and performance of components, equipment and processes relating to the production of electricity from renewable sources and/or cogeneration systems; and\n\nSupport, through a recruitment and training plan for technicians, by professional training institutes and the association of universities and national research bodies in the research and training of engineers.\n\nAlgeria\n\nThe Law No. 16-09 of 03 August 2016 on investment promotion is the main legislative instrument governing foreign investment in Algeria.\n\nThe National Agency of Development of Investment (ANDI), created by article 6 of the ordinance n°01-03 of August 20th, 2001, modified and supplemented, is a public administrative establishment, endowed with the moral personality and the financial autonomy, in charge, in coordination with the administrations and the concerned organizations, of:\n\nthe registration of investments;\n\nthe promotion of investments in Algeria and abroad;\n\nthe promotion of territorial opportunities;\n\nfacilitating business practices, monitoring the formation of companies and the implementation of projects;\n\nassistance, help and support for investors;\n\ninformation and awareness-raising for the business community; and\n\nthe qualification of projects, their evaluation and the establishment of the investment agreement to be submitted for approval to the national investment council.\n\nA new law on investment promotion in Algeria is currently in the works."
