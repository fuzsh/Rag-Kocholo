        "text": "The Tenth Ordinary General Meeting was held at the Company's Offices, Surrey House, Victoria Embankment, on July 29, 1890; the Right Hon. Lord ABERDARE, G.C.B., the Governor of the Company, in the chair.\n\nThe SECRETARY (Mr. Henry Morley) read the notice convening the meeting. The report and accounts were taken as read.\n\nLORD ABERDARE said:—\n\nThe commercial history of the Company during the year 1889 having been one of steady and encouraging progress and its strong financial position being plainly set forth in the Balance-sheet and Report—the adoption of which I am about to move—I do not propose to-day to make any remark upon them, excepting as regards two important matters—viz., 1st, the temporary diminution of trade in the longer established and more settled part of the Territories near the seaboard, due to the restrictions placed by the Company on the liquor traffic as an instrument of sale or barter; and 2nd, the considerable increase in the total trade of the territories due to those newly-discovered products of which I spoke hopefully, but not too hopefully, at our last annual meeting, and to the development of the operations of the Company in the interior.\n\nI have on this occasion a special reason for not occupying your limited time in dwelling on such matters of detail as do not urgently call for explanation. Our opportunities of conferring with you are necessarily few; whilst, owing to the extraordinary—I might almost say exaggerated—attention that Europe has of late devoted to Tropical Africa, the administrative policy of the Company, which has indeed made considerable calls on our energies and judgment, has naturally been the subject of many anxious inquiries, and some kindly meant letters of warning and advice, both from shareholders and from persons unconnected with the Company, but interested in the maintenance of British rights in the Central Soudan. I wish to take this opportunity of thanking our correspondents, and of assuring them that if we have not felt ourselves at liberty to reply fully, if at all, to their inquiries or to discuss their views, it is only because we consider that such information and such replies should be given officially to the whole body of shareholders after mature deliberation as to how much we can safely publish without injury to the future interests of the Company and of Great Britain. It is reasonable to assume that the subjects which have interested our correspondents have also engaged the attention of our shareholders generally, and I think that our annual meetings can hardly serve a more useful purpose than that of removing any anxieties which may have been caused to our shareholders by rumours in the newspapers.\n\nAmongst these rumours I must give the first rank to that of French interference in the Central Soudan. Certain Chauvinist Parisian newspapers have revived the dream of a vast French African Empire, extending from the Mediterranean on the north to the Gulf of Guinea on the south, and from the Atlantic on the west to Egypt on the east, and have been suggesting that Great Britain should cede to France the Central Soudan and her possessions on the seaboard at the mouths of the Niger, generally known as the Oil Rivers. Such cessions would include regions, the annual import and export trade of which is already reckoned by millions of pounds sterling, and where there has not been for some years a single French trader, or, indeed, any Frenchman, with the exception of a few missionaries who are pursuing their pious vocation on the Lower Niger under the protection and jurisdiction of the Company. I do not for one moment believe that this suggestion has received any encouragement from the French Government, which is fully aware that in this year, 1890, such an idea would be an anachronism. There was a time, indeed, only six or seven years ago, when similar schemes caused us keen anxiety; when two powerful French houses, for a brief period, commenced to trade and exercise influence on the Lower Niger and Benue; when the Company's treaties with the States of Gandu, Sokoto, Takum, and Borgu, and with the 800 less important pagan tribes of the Territories, were not made, and when Great Britain did not hold a single treaty justifying the exercise of political influence even on the seaboard of the Oil Rivers. If the Company, during those years of struggle, had not been equal to the occasion, the whole of its present territories would in all human probability have become French, and the neighbouring inland countries from which the British Protectorate of the Oil Rivers draws its trade must then have also passed into the hands of France. You know, gentlemen, too well, by what efforts and at what cost that result was averted, and it is well to bear in mind that, whatever may be the case in other parts of the world, the possession by Great Britain of the basins of the Middle and Lower Niger and of the Benue has not been due to Government assistance, but to your own pecuniary sacrifices, and to your support of the Council in their prolonged and anxious efforts. You will remember how one of the French houses, on fusing with you, took up £60,000 worth of shares in the Company. I am heartily glad that we have this co-operation of French capital with our own, and I take this opportunity of recognising the cordial assistance that has been uniformly given, and the generous confidence that has been constantly displayed by our friends in Paris. There are strong reasons for believing that no political rivalry in regard to the English and French spheres of influence in the basin of the Niger is likely to arise to disturb this commercial harmony. Nature has placed between these spheres formidable barriers, which could only be overcome by an initial expenditure out of all proportion to any probable returns for many years. The empires of Sokoto and Gandu, within the British sphere, are separated from Algeria and Tunis by the Great Sahara. On the Upper Niger the French have gained much influence by a series of brilliant military expeditions from their colony of Senegambia; but I believe that they have not, as yet, established any commerce in those extensive regions. From their fort at Sego, on the Upper Niger, a small armed launch lately descended the river as far as Timbuctoo, but was compelled to retire without landing even at the port of that town, which will doubtless, however, at some not far distant date, pass into the hands of France, together with the whole basin of the Upper Niger. Between Timbuctoo and the British Niger, the river flows through a long series of rapids, which are an effective barrier to navigation, whilst the land on either side is rocky and sparsely populated.\n\nIn one direction alone did it appear at all probable that France might be brought within measurable distance of the British Niger, that is in the event of the conquest of Dahomey. We have therefore thought it advisable to conclude a treaty of protection and jurisdiction with the large and important kingdom of Borgu, placing it under the British flag. This treaty finally assures the Middle Niger against any foreign interference either from the direction of Dahomey or from the Western Soudan by land. We have also just completed fresh and highly important treaties with Sokoto and Gandu. You will remember that those which were made on our behalf by Mr. Joseph Thomson, gave us jurisdiction over the country on the banks of the Benue and Middle Niger, but not over the main areas of the empires, where we obtained only certain rights of political influence and certain commercial privileges. In those days our communications with Sokoto and Gandu were limited, and we did not then think it prudent to propose a more ambitious treaty. Constant friendly intercourse and commerce with Sokoto and Gandu have altered the position, and we have just been able to conclude irrevocable and perpetual treaties, giving us the fullest jurisdiction—fiscal, criminal, civil, and of every other kind—over all non-natives throughout the whole of the two empires, that is to say over all persons not actual subjects of those empires. The best security against political rivalry, however, lies in the fact that France has on the upper Niger a vast and populous region to conquer, civilise, and develop, which is likely to absorb her energies for many years. The Company, as the representative of England, has abstained, and desires to abstain, from interfering by treaty-making, or otherwise, with the extension and consolidation of French influence in the Western Soudan, and there is reason to hope that France will equally abstain from efforts to override or hamper British rights in the Central Soudan.\n\nI will next deal with the controversy, now amicably and satisfactorily settled, which was raised some two years ago in Germany, to which I alluded at our last annual meeting. You will remember that the German criticisms—though they incidentally raised the question of a supposed monopolising tendency on the part of the Company—were really based on and directed against the Company’s rights of jurisdiction in Nupe; and that the British Government sent out a commissioner of high character and considerable experience in African matters to report confidentially, not only on this matter, but also on the general state of affairs in the Territories. I need hardly say that we looked with great satisfaction on this course.\n\nWe ourselves were indeed confident of the validity of the Company's rights, and were more than satisfied with the rapid progress made, under great difficulties, in pacifying the Territories, developing their commercial resources, and protecting and promoting the interests of the native populations, so that even the German official report, while attacking our policy, fully admitted that we were \"admirably organised.\" But we had suffered much from the unfounded calumnies of a small but noisy and unpatriotic clique of our own countrymen, actuated partly by jealousy, partly by the legislative restrictions of the Company on the liquor traffic, and partly by the hope that by blackening and depreciating the chartered government of the Niger Territories, they might prevent the issue of a similar charter to the neighbouring Oil Rivers. These attacks were almost invariably anonymous, but by persistent and unscrupulous innuendoes they undoubtedly produced some effect on the minds of those credulous persons, who accept without inquiry any anonymous paragraph which has been copied into half-a-dozen newspapers. We, therefore, recognised the immense advantage to us of the British Government possessing a full, independent and unbiassed report of the position and policy of the Company. We have not, of course, seen this confidential report, nor have we received any notification or suggestion founded on it or connected with it, but I may draw your attention to the following remarks in the recent despatch from Sir Percy Anderson published in the papers laid before Parliament relating to the late agreement with Germany. He says, \"I am bound to say that in respect of the Niger Company I find a sensitiveness\"—in the German Government—\"which is, in my opinion, based in a great measure on the fact that too much weight is given to reports of persons admittedly hostile to the Company, and too little allowance is made for necessary imperfections of administration in regions hardly, as yet, under civilising influences.\"\n\nSince preparing my speech, Sir James Fergusson has only last night informed the House of Commons that \"Major Macdonald's report regarding the Niger Territories was intended to be confidential. It is of a very detailed character, and cannot be communicated. Indeed, it will receive further and more particular consideration. A principal object of his work was to furnish her Majesty's Government with materials for considering the question of extending the charter over adjacent districts. He was further to inquire into certain points under discussion with Germany, with the result that satisfactory explanations have been exchanged during the recent negotiations at Berlin. In addition, he was to examine the administration of the Royal Niger Company, with regard to which he describes it as in the main highly satisfactory as to progress, system, and observance of the charter.\"\n\nI will now pass to the important question of the relations between the Company and the Christian Missions within their jurisdiction. These relations had been so uniformly harmonious and cordial with all the various denominations which have, from time to time, had establishments in the Territories, that our surprise was great on receiving a copy of a well-known religious newspaper containing a long letter from a member of the Church Missionary Society, which accused the Company of promising by treaty, and arranging by public notice, not only not to convert Mohammedans, but to \"do all that lies in their power to obstruct others who come under their influence.\" The writer remarks that, \"this amounts to open war of so-called Christian men with the Gospel.\" This letter gave rise to a paragraph of a somewhat sensational character in another religious newspaper. It was headed, \"Wanted, an adjective to describe the conduct hereinafter described of the Royal Niger Company,\" and it proceeded to characterise our supposed conduct as cowardly meanness, and trusted \"our Parliament had an hour to spare for the purpose of depriving of their charter these betrayers of their country's religion and honour.\" It is not surprising that shareholders and others inquired of us whether these things were true. No reply of the Company could have been so effective as that which was spontaneously published by the two chief representatives of the Church Missionary Society resident in the Niger Territories, who were fortunately in England at that time. Their letter is too long to read in full, but the following are the most interesting passages:—\n\n\"We, who have been residing in the Soudanese districts of the River Niger for the express purpose of seeking the conversion of Mohammedans, have read with feelings of pain and surprise an attack by \"R.N.C.\", in your last issue, on the Royal Niger Company, Chartered and Limited, to whose unceasing courtesy and kindness we are both deeply indebted. While we are sure that \"R. N. C.\" was impelled by his warm interest in the missionary cause to write as he did, and would be the last intentionally to wrong such true friends of the missionaries as the Royal Niger Company have proved themselves, yet we feel that it would not be right for us, who know the true state of affairs from actual residence on the spot, not to point out to your readers that his information, as shown by his letter, has been very fragmentary and imperfect.\n\n\"The 'public notice' of the Royal Niger Company, to which he refers, has been welcomed by all of us who have been, or expect to be, engaged in preaching to Moslems on that river; and was, indeed, in general outline, suggested to the Company by us, as affording in our opinion the only possible solution to the grave social and political difficulties of the situation. We sincerely regret that 'R. N. C.' did not see his way to inquire into the actual facts from some of the people concerned, who would have been only too glad to supply him with the information. Beyond this public notice there is no foundation for 'R. N. C.'s' assertions.\n\n\"In conclusion, then, as those who have been appointed leaders of the C.M.S. Mission to the Soudan, we most earnestly deprecate 'R. N. C.'s' interpretation of this public notice of the Royal Niger Company as 'open war of so-called Christian men with the Gospel.' We feel, on the contrary, that it saves us from many political dangers, and gives our message great moral strength. In thus writing, we are glad to bear testimony to the cordial assistance which the Company has always rendered to us in our work, to the thoughtful kindness and personal care rendered to us in sickness by their officers, and to the pains taken by the heads of the Company on the river to further the interests of the mission work in which we were engaged.\"\n\nBut our assistance is not extended alone to Protestant denominations, of which the Church Missionary Society happens to be at present the sole representative. It is also given to the two French Catholic missions which are working on the banks of the Lower Niger under our jurisdiction, and who have frequently and recently acknowledged with gratitude the cordial relations existing between them and the Company.\n\nI will next refer to many well-meant letters which we have received, advising us to send out expeditions, to make treaties, to explore the country, and so forth. On reading these letters, I felt some doubts whether we may not have been too modest in advertising ourselves. The operations thus urged upon us have been, I may say, the constant and, indeed, daily work of our excellent staff in Africa ever since the issue of the Charter, and have been taken so much as a matter of course, that we have no more thought of communicating them to the Press than the movements of our fleet of twenty to thirty steamers and launches, our negotiations with native princes, the trials in our courts of law, the highly satisfactory progress of our public plantations, the construction of a new wharf, gaol or hospital, or any other normal work of the Niger Government. The absorbing labour of extending the influence and operations of the Company over such uncivilised and undeveloped regions has perhaps made us unduly overlook the uncongenial but useful art of sounding our own trumpets. On the other hand, our reticence has rendered us the great service of enabling us to consolidate the influence of Great Britain in the Central Soudan without friction or without arousing a spirit of competition amongst other European nations. Our steady progress has thus escaped attention, and would probably have continued to do so but for the publication of the Anglo-German Agreement in East Africa, which awakened the susceptibilities of the French Press.\n\nIn dealing with this question, I cannot refrain from again drawing your attention to the invaluable services in all these operations of the numerous officials of our Executive Department, under the able direction of our Agent-General, Mr. Joseph Flint, and his representative when absent, Mr. William Wallace. Nor must I pass by those rendered by our small but highly organised military force, under the command of Captain Saulez and his officers, and by our Medical Department, under the supervision of Dr. Crosse. At the time of our last annual meeting, our new Chief Justice Samuel Moore had only just commenced his responsible work in the Territories. After the experience of a year we are in a position to recognise the practical wisdom and breadth of views which have enabled him to combine the enforcement of British law with careful regard to the customs and feelings of the natives.\n\nThe last, but not the least important matter to which I will refer to-day is the policy of the Company in regard to the importation of liquors for the purposes of sale or barter. You have been kept informed in the past of the steps which we have successfully taken, not only in preventing, as far as was then practicable, the intrusion of the liquor traffic into the regions of the interior, as these became gradually opened up by the Company, but also in reducing its proportions by more than 75 per cent. in the seaboard regions, where, before the issue of the Charter and the imposition of the present heavy duties, spirits had threatened to become the principal article of commerce, as I understand they are still in the neighbouring British Colony of Lagos, where the duty on this article is extremely low, and in the neighbouring British Protectorate of the Oil Rivers, where there is as yet no duty whatever. This restrictive policy has not been carried out without serious temporary detriment to the commerce of the Company and to the territories, nor without producing much troublesome disaffection amongst the native chiefs and tribes. It is most fortunate that the Company's recent discoveries and rapid development of new products in the inland regions have more than counterbalanced this inevitable, but we hope only temporary, diminution of commerce in the seaboard regions; and, although we should naturally find it pleasant to earn and declare a dividend of 10 or 12 per cent. instead of only 6 per cent., we remain unshaken in our belief that apart from questions of philanthropy we are really promoting your ultimate and permanent pecuniary interests as well as carrying out the duties which you tacitly accepted in assuming the responsibilities of government. I may remind you that this is no new nor borrowed view on our part. I believe that the Company was the first public body to enunciate and urge upon the Government this principle in regard to Central Africa. At the time of the meeting of the Berlin Conference in October 1884, the Native Races and Liquor Traffic United Committee, which has since done such admirable service, had not come into existence. A reference to the Blue Book Africa No. 4 (1885) will show, what is moreover well-known at the Foreign Office, that this question had been warmly urged on the British Delegates by your Deputy-Governor, Sir George Goldie, who was acting as the Company's representative, at the Berlin Conference, and who in so doing was only giving effect to the deep conviction he had long entertained, and which he had succeeded in impressing on his colleagues in the Council. These opinions were adopted by the British Delegates, and were pressed by them on the Conference before the earliest representation had been made by any public body in England to our Foreign Secretary. Her Majesty's Government were unable to carry their proposal at the Berlin Conference owing to the opposition of certain other Powers; but, largely in consequence of the strenuous efforts of the United Committee, the policy advocated by Sir George Goldie at Berlin has, within the last few weeks, been adopted by Europe at the Brussels Conference. We have lost no time in taking advantage of this International Agreement, and we have this morning made a Regulation absolutely prohibiting the importation of spirituous liquors, for sale or barter, into any place within the jurisdiction of the Company north of the seventh parallel of north latitude—that is to say, into about nineteen-twentieths of the regions over which the Company has treaty rights of jurisdiction. We trust the day is not far distant when the same policy may be enforced in the remaining twentieth of our Territories; but until the Company's military force is greatly strengthened, the attempt would inevitably be attended by disastrous failure. All we can do there, is to pursue our present policy of discouraging the importation of spirits within these restricted limits by levying on them the highest practicable duty. In this and similar measures we are confident of your support, as we have received numberless verbal-written, and even telegraphic communications from shareholders, encouraging us to persevere in the course which we have deliberately adopted and steadily pursued.\n\nIn conclusion, Lord Aberdare moved: \"That the report and accounts now presented be received and adopted.\" Mr. John Edgar seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously. Lord Aberdare proposed, and Mr. Alex. Miller seconded a resolution whereby the sanction of the shareholders was given to the distribution of a dividend of 3½ per cent., making a total dividend of 6 per cent. for 1889. The Members of the Council who retired by rotation were The Hon. C. W. Mills, M.P., and Mr. Alex. Miller, who were both re-elected.\n\nThe retiring Auditors, Messrs. Turquand, Youngs, Weise, Bishop & Clarke, were also re-appointed. A vote of thanks to Lord Aberdare for presiding was carried unanimously, and the proceedings then terminated.\n\nChapter I., on the distribution of the work of the Conference, included a wide range of subjects summed up as measures for the repression of the land traffic—that is to say, for stopping the slave-trade at its starting-point. Most of these appear to be rather in the nature of rules for homogeneous action which each State undertakes to carry out to the best of its ability than in that of international engagements. But there is, however, one subject in this chapter which is of paramount importance—viz., the traffic in firearms.\n\nSome idea of the importance of this question may be gathered from the fact that into Zanzibar alone some 80,000 to 100,000 muskets and rifles are imported annually. Firearms are bartered to Arab traders on the coast for ivory and other inland products, a large proportion of them being the disused rifles of present European standing armies. The object of the provisions of the Brussels Conference on this subject is to protect the negro against his Arab enemy and captor by disarming the latter.\n\nThe principle of preserving the native African races was inserted in the General Act of Berlin, by which \"the Powers undertake to watch over the preservation of the native races and the improvement of their moral and material conditions.\" There was, therefore, no question of principle to discuss. Nor was there any doubt as to interference with the traffic in firearms being indispensable. The difficulties lay in determining the extent to which this interference should be carried, so as to avoid any unnecessary interference with great trading interests and practical disarmament of those who need the arms for their own defence, and to take such measures as would leave no loopholes for the trade to be carried on by different channels.\n\nThere were several courses possible. It had to be decided whether the trade throughout Africa should be regulated, or whether the regulations should be confined to the affected district. And also whether the regulations should take the form of prohibition altogether, or be framed on lines of restriction with distinctions.\n\nThe French Government made a strong stand in favour of entire prohibition throughout Africa; but the view taken by the Governments of Great Britain, Holland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy was opposed to so radical a step, as going beyond the purpose of preserving the native races and as implying the needless sacrifice of a large mercantile interest without local justification. The Conference came ultimately to the same conclusion. The next question was to determine the area within which the importation of firearms was to be regulated. This zone is believed to extend from 20 degs. of north latitude to 22 degs. of south latitude, from coast to coast across the African Continent between these lines, as well as to 100 marine miles seawards.\n\nAs regards restriction or prohibition, the Conference has steered midway between the two extremes. Prohibition will be laid down as a principle, but with exceptions. In these cases the arms imported are to be lodged in Government warehouses, from which they will only be withdrawable on permission being granted by the proper authorities, and no such permission will be granted in the case of improved weapons, except to travellers and proper persons, in which case the weapons will be stamped and numbered, and the recipient will have to be bearer of a license to bear arms.\n\nChapter II., on caravan routes—that is, for the institution of posts by the Powers in their possessions for the prevention of slave-trading expeditions, and their interception if formed, and also for the examination of caravans at their places of destination inland and on the coast by the territorial Power—did not involve any essential differences of opinion. The only question in this chapter which gave rise to controversy related to a proposal to exact security from the chiefs and organisers of caravans as a guarantee of their taking no part in the slave-trade. This was obviously not feasible, as caravans seldom return to their starting-point with the same elements. They are renewed from place to place among the tribes they pass, remain often a very long time in the centre, and return to the coast at different points. Ultimately the obligation of giving security was confined to the case of those who had already been condemned for slave-trade offences.\n\nThe abolition of slavery in the American continent put an end to the slave-trade on the West Coast of Africa. In the East it is the existence of slavery which keeps alive slave-trade in the regions where it still prevails; and until slavery in the East is extinguished, slave-hunting will continue to drag on some kind of existence, however successful their efforts in Africa itself may be. Chapter IV. therefore deals with measures for the extinction of the Eastern market for slaves.\n\nThis is a task differing considerably from that of abolishing slavery in the West. It implies a change of social conditions which are deeply rooted in the polity of the peoples concerned—a transformation requiring time as well as a spirit of energetic interference on the part of the territorial authority—a spirit which is not inherent to the character of Eastern Governments.\n\nIn principle, laws against slavery exist in the countries concerned. One of the tasks of the Conference was to stimulate the execution of these laws, so far as consistent with respect of the independence of the States in view. This chapter had the peculiar character of involving, however delicately handled, a semblance of dictating to one of the Powers in particular represented at the Conference table. The difficulty was sufficiently to indicate reprehension of domestic slavery while yet observing the proprieties of diplomatic language. The chief effect of the work done by this chapter will be its having opened up Turkey and Persia to the direct action of European public opinion.\n\nChapter V. relates to the organisation of institutions connected with the execution of the General Act—viz., an International Maritime Bureau, to be created at Zanzibar, for the centralising of information concerning the slave-trade; an organised exchange of documents and information as between European Governments direct through a special department, to be created, of the Belgian Foreign Office; and Liberation Bureaux for the delivery of certificates of freedom, the protection of liberated slaves, and the procuring of means of livelihood for them in the territories of the contracting States.\n\nChapter VII. also relates to formal questions, such as accessions and ratifications.\n\nChapter VI. deals with the difficult question of the regulation of the liquor traffic, a question of vital importance in connexion with the preservation of the native races, and one of the tasks set before the Conference by the Conference of Berlin. That Conference adopted a resolution setting forth that the Powers there represented expressed the hope that an understanding should be arrived at which would conciliate the rights of humanity with the interests of trade in so far as such interests were legitimate. Since 1884 there has been an intermittent agitation throughout Western Europe to regulate the traffic. During the present Conference numerous recommendations and memorials have been handed in, and it has been the subject of resolutions in both the British and the German Parliaments. The provisions of Chapter VI. were due to the initiative of the British Government, whose scheme distinguished between populations among whom the importation of spirituous liquors had not yet begun and populations which had acquired the use of such liquors. For the first of these two classes the British Plenipotentiaries proposed absolute prohibition, and for the second a heavy duty on alcoholic drinks. Intimately connected with this is the question of the free trade régime imposed on the territories of the Congo basin, which unless altered, will constitute a channel into the interior of Africa—regions still uncontaminated by the liquor traffic.\n\nIn spite of strenuous efforts of the British Plenipotentiaries, warmly backed by the French Plenipotentiaries, the provisions of the liquor traffic chapter have not come up to the standard originally contemplated. The Powers were unanimous in agreeing to the prohibition as regards the first class of populations above referred to within a fixed zone. As regards the second class of populations—they will be allowed to procure liquor subject to payment of a duty of 15 francs per hectolitre of 50 deg. (that is, about 1½d. per quart) for three years. At the expiry of three years this duty is subject to revision in the sense of an increase. Yet this result cannot be considered altogether unsatisfactory, inasmuch as there are large trade interests concerned; and it is probable that at the expiry of three years experience and public opinion will be strong enough to force the Powers to agree to a heavier duty after the liquor trade has received good warning."
