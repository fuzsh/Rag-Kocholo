        "text": "So many years after independence, more importation of foreign brand of alcohol has remained a strategy of economic imperialism. Attempts to modernize African brands of alcohol such as bottled palm wine and burukutu have not received the kind of scientific endorsement it deserve. In all drinking spaces in Nigeria, the foreign brand of drinks in Nigeria dominates the market. These brands no doubt serve as a yardstick of measuring class distinction. This trend began as part of deliberate effort to dominate the local economy by re-inventing sense of class, modernity and sense of new belonging expressed through the kind bottles of drinks consumed by the people. As a result, the African brands of drinks were downgraded in a kind of economic war that she plays a subservient role even though by drinking, Africans contributes greatly to the Europeans economy at their own peril.\n\nThe present article examines the North American rum-for-captives trade, which like other New World-based trades, relied heavily on sugar cane-derived alcohol. It argues that African consumption patterns played a key role in shaping the American rum-for-captives trade during the years 1730-1807. Most interpretations of the rum trade offer what might be termed a \" supply-side \" interpretation of the slave trade, an emphasis on voyage planning and decision making on the part of European and American slave traders. While these were important factors, an examination of the rum trade highlights the important demand-side factors that shaped the slave trade. The most important market for American rum was the Gold Coast, but slave traders still needed to adopt a range of practices in order to cope with the problem of oversupply. The Upper Guinea Coast served as secondary market, but here the expansion of Islam, in part a response to the growing trade in captives, imposed limits on the demand for alcohol. After independence in 1783, American merchants were able to gain access to French and Dutch India goods, which allowed them to diversify their assortment of trade goods, especially after 1793. Carrying textiles in addition to rum helped the United States to become the third-largest carrier immediately before abolition in 1808.\n\nThe question we need to ask and answer is: As a result of trade was there growth in the African Economy or was the continent underdeveloped or developing during the pre-colonial era? This paper is aimed at critically analysing the potentials of the pre-colonial African Trade using data from various well achieved historians. We will explore Africaâ€™s economy as it developed overtime and responded to economic changes. Will specifically investigate the forms of trade and currencies used which facilitated trade in Africa, will provide locations they were traded from and to who or locations it was traded to. We will examine the kingdoms and cities which rose to growth and prosperity as a result of trade, the trade routes and the trade strategies they employed. We will find that the economies of some African societies were hunting-gathering, agricultural-based, crafts-level (not industrial-level) hand-tool manufacturing, which produced agricultural tools, cloths, iron or copper implements, pottery, jewelry, weapons for hunting or warfare amongst others products.\n\nThe area now designated Nigeria has a long history of communities trading across frontiers with neighbours and distant lands long before the arrival of the Europeans and the introduction of modern international trading system. The various polities that emerged and controlled different parts of the area participated effectively and benefited from long distance trade, which afforded them the opportunity to exchange their abundance for what they lacked but which was available elsewhere whether far or near. With reference to the nature of the Nigerian environment, regional specialisation, external trade relations and the capacity of the traditional economy, this paper examines international trade in pre-colonial Nigeria and its impact on the economy. The paper concludes that the distortion of inter-regional trade arrangement and the structure of pre-colonial Nigerian economy began with the gradual penetration of Europeans into the hinterland to effect direct purchase of palm produced from producers after the abolition of slave trade.
