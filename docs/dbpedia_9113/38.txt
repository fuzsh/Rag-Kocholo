Until 1884 what is now Togo was an intermediate zone between the African states of Ashanti and Dahomey. Togo was a German protectorate from 1884 until August 26, 1914 when French and British forces occupied Togo. On July 20, 1922, France and Britain received League of Nations mandates over eastern and western Togo respectively, and Togo became a United Nations trust territory in 1946.

The British portion, renamed British Togoland, was administered from the Gold Coast. When the Gold Coast gained its independence, British Togoland became part of the independent country of Ghana. French Togo became autonomous on June 24, 1956 and achieved independence on April 27, 1960.

German Marks (DEP) had circulated in Togo while it was a German protectorate, but after the British occupied the western part of Togo in 1914, British Pounds Sterling and West African Pounds began circulating there. The Pound was divisible into 20 Shillings and 240 Pence.

On July 1, 1913, the West African Currency Board was established originally to issue coins, but the Constitution was revised in November 1915 to allow for the issue of Pound (XWAP) banknotes at par with the British Pound Sterling. The West African Currency Board became a model for other currency boards in Africa and elsewhere. The Pound was divisible into 20 Shillings or 240 Pence. For Togo's monetary history after becoming part of Ghana, see Ghana.

Banknotes and coins from the Banque de France (FRG) also were allowed to circulate in French West Africa, and all monies of Metropolitan France were given legal tender status in French West Africa on August 8, 1920. Some British coins and Maria Theresa Thalers also circulated until the 1920s. The French issued the first coins for French Togo in 1924.

On December 26, 1945, the Franc des Colonies Francaises d'Afrique (CFA Franc-XCOF) was introduced, and the circulation of Banque de France banknotes was no longer tolerated. From 1945 until 1958, banknotes of the Banque de l'Afrique Occidentale circulated in Togo, and since 1958, banknotes of the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (XOF) have circulated. On August 2, 1993, Members of Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) ceased redeeming CFA franc notes issued by BEAC circulating outside their borders, and On 17 December 1993, members of BCEAO suspended redemption of CFA franc notes issued by Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) circulating in BCEAO countries. Togo notes have the letter √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚ÄúT√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù on them. Some numismatic coins have been issued by Cote d'Ivoire, but no coins for general circulation.

The West African Economic Monetary Union (WAEMU) is a regional entity established by a treaty signed on January 10, 1994 and entered into force on August 1, 1994 after its ratification by all member countries. The aim of the treaty√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨¬ùbuilt on the achievements of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU), established in 1962√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨¬ùwas to create a new framework for fostering the achievement of the member countries' growth and development objectives. It was also to provide the credibility required to sustain the fixed exchange rate for the common currency.

The Union has a common central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (Banque Centrale des états de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO)), with headquarters in Dakar and national branches in the member states. WAEMU comprises eight francophone countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Mali and Guinea-Bissau joined the Union on June 1, 1984 and May 2, 1997, respectively. The BCEAO issues the common currency of the WAEMU member countries, the CFA franc (CFA stands for "Communauté Financière Africaine" since 1958; from 1945 through 1958, CFA stood for "Colonies Francaises d'Afrique").

On August 2, 1993, Members of Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) ceased redeeming CFA franc notes issued by BEAC circulating outside their borders, and On 17 December 1993, members of BCEAO suspended redemption of CFA franc notes issued by Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) circulating in BCEAO countries. Benin notes have the letter √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚ÄúB√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù placed on them. Some numismatic coins have been issued by Dahomey/Benin, but no coins have been issued for general circulation.
