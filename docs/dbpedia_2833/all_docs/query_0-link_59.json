Cut Your Teeth\n\nShip of Fools, Newmarket Ontario punk rock, return with their ferocious 4-song EP, ‘Status Quo’. With their first release since 2018, Ship of Fools address issues such as today’s political climate, the stigma surrounding mental health &amp; emphasize social justice, inclusion, and human rights. Engineered &amp; mixed by Greg Hounsell (Brutal Youth) &amp; mastered by Scott Middleton (Cancer Bats), Status Quo breathes new life into hardcore punk; with explosive guitar riffs, cut-throat bass lines, thunderous percussion &amp; gruff, melodic vocals. ‘Status Quo’ is not only an invitation to challenge ideals, morals &amp; ethics, but also an insight into the direction &amp; beliefs of who Ship of Fools are today.",

        "text": "1.\n\nConsequences 02:23\n\nWake up tired Come home dead I’m not wasted At least not yet A day to die for A change in time Plastic moments Pass you by Smile through the changes And face a different day The secrets you never hear about Are trapped inside my head I’m fucking done with it A distinct trademark A life of crime The consequences In due time Straight back to the fucking curb, It’s where it began Smile through the changes And live another day With nothing left to worry about With nothing left to say I’m struggling to hold on to something positive And what’s the point of giving up Will you change your ways and pray Do you challenge others’ morals? Do you contemplate their pain? Imagine facing all the fucking differences And do you believe in hopes and dreams that pass you by? Have you ever thought about all those who didn’t try? Did you ever think you’d watch it all just fade away?\n\n2.\n\nStatus Quo 02:25\n\nI’m stood here in a contradiction As we push things out the door Stumbling through with good intentions While we show what we stand for We were never really made for this So fight on through Join hands, stand together Protect the people you know and love Walk on and fight those demons Because you’re not one to give up We are all strong enough to spark a bit of change A fuck you to the ignorant and those who are to blame Alright! We’re taking back control Of Life! Supporting friends we love You can change the status quo And write the fucking rest How many nightmares will you face tonight? How many days have you faced this fight Down a darkened road you couldn’t miss You’ll be a bright spot A fucking gentleman And when I’m dead I hope that people live in a society Where things have changed and we’re all one And I’ll spend my every breath to stand in solidarity Against the racists, the rapists and those Who should rot and waste away So join me in sharing morals and aiming to be better men So be an ally and show that you can Before your dead please own up and take on responsibility To listen, reason and grow up and show Alright! We’re taking back control Of Life!\n\n3.\n\nOpen for Business 02:39\n\nHere’s an open invitation A strong-armed welcome to his unprogressive world Four more years of humiliation Forgiven with a buck-a-beer and a place to grow Who would give him the praise? He’s open for business A deep and dark faze It’s where we’re headed Whilst making cuts to education Double the classroom size to save a bit of dough With no platform or foundation Yours to discover, well who would fucking know? Who would give him the praise? He’s open for business A deep and dark faze It’s where we’re headed These companies are vicious Strip you down for what you need Knocking elbows in public with fascists It’s not my province, it’s not for me Doesn’t take much to be a good man A bit of empathy good honest people know While making damage to our progress By defunding the police, let the teachers grow Who would give him the praise? He’s open for business A deep and dark faze It’s where we’re headed Wake up, these times are vicious Who would care, he’s open for business Not for the people And who would care about affordable housing The rich get richer while we’re left here fucking wondering Get back to the fucking basics Get back to what we should know Give back to working people Give back to those without homes And I’m not sacrilegious And I’ll never follow But I’ll stand with all my neighbours And I’ll fight for my Ontario\n\n4.\n\nCut Your Teeth 01:36"
