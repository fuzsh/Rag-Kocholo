        "text": "Status Quo have been in the album charts for a landmark 500 weeks, joining the likes of Queen, The Beatles and Elvis, new figures from the Official Charts Company reveal.\n\nThe rock group’s new album ‘Aquostic (Stripped Bare)’, currently at Number 34, has been in the charts for 11 weeks, meaning the band have been in the album charts for 500 weeks over their career.\n\nOnly 50 acts have achieved the feat, including leaders Queen, who have spent 1,457 weeks in the album charts, runners up The Beatles, who have spent 1,406 weeks in the charts, and Elvis Presley, who’s accumulated 1,364 weeks.\n\n‘Aquostic (Stripped Bare)’, Status Quo’s 31st studio album, features some of the bands biggest hits recorded acoustically for the first time. It peaked at Number Five following its release in October, the band’s highest chart position since 1996’s ‘Don’t Stop’ Reached Number 2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“To be celebrating 500 weeks in the Official Album Chart – that’s almost 10 years”, Status Quo’s Francis Rossi told the Official Charts Company. “It feels incredible. It’s almost surreal that this band that we formed all those years ago could reach this point. It’s a tangible achievement though, and a milestone we’re very proud of.\n\n“‘Aquostic (Stripped Bare)’ is itself our highest charting album for 18 years and has just been certified Gold, so it’s not been a bad few weeks. I rarely believe in looking backwards though, we’re by no means done yet; 2015 will be another interesting year for Quo!”\n\nStatus Quo are due to play a headline UK tour this year. The band will play:\n\nRecommended"
