I don't think it would take very much for them to be hugely tempted. Unless I'm missing something, I'd sell while there's still buyers out there offering boggling sums\n\n\"Why Superstar Artists Are Selling Their Music Rights: An Explainer – Rolling Stone\" www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/famous-musicians-selling-catalog-music-rights-1114580/amp/\n\nPost by roquer on\n\nI might be wrong, but I remember in an interview Francis said that they don't receive any money from the old catalogue since the last 90s from a deal that David Walker did. But it might be wrong, because an interview from days ago, said he did at least well since the lockdown because of the royalties.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nI don't really see a huge company like, say, Sony wanting Quo's back catalogue. It seems to me it's only been artists who have sold in vast quantities worldwide and more especially in America. Quo's market is considerably smaller.\n\nIt also appears to have been mainly individual artists, some of whom are in bands (Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham etc.) so I imagine anyone would only want their hands on Francis Rossi's material with Rick and Alan gone, although they'd have to get teasers out to Rhino and Andy in particular if they wanted to repackage/reissue anything after 1986.\n\nNot that I know how it works. I'm just surmising.\n\nIt's presumably a very long-term project by music companies. Recouping these sorts of sums quickly doesn't seem likely.\n\nAnd, as already hinted at, it depends who owns the publishing rights as things stand at the moment. It may not be any of the band for all I know.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nThe thing about Quo's stuff is, the numerous compilations have probably sold pretty well and it's the hits anyone would be interested in. If anything that is.\n\nIt's interesting but that article linked at the start of this thread cited quite a few artists that I've only really heard of in terms of their name (Timbaland, Nelly, 50 Cent, Skrillex e.g.). I remember a collaboration between Skrillex and Korn but that's about it and I have a 50 Cent single called P.I.M.P. So I'm presuming we're talking largely rap here although the Korn thing was a homage to dubstep (remember that? ).\n\nThe point I'm making is that it may be very surprising who is able to sell their music publishing rights. I wouldn't discount Quo entirely.\n\nPost by col on\n\nDo Quo actually own their recordings?\n\nI suspect everything from the sixties, seventies and eighties (and probably half the nineties) belongs to the record companies, which is probably Universal all the way.\n\nIf that's true, Quo ain't really got anything to sell, only UTI and everything from TPAOY album onward. There may have been some licensing from Acklode but that would only get back to the Don't Stop album (see what I did there).\n\nPost by Quoincidence on\n\nDo Quo actually own their recordings?\n\nI suspect everything from the sixties, seventies and eighties (and probably half the nineties) belongs to the record companies, which is probably Universal all the way.\n\nIf that's true, Quo ain't really got anything to sell, only UTI and everything from TPAOY album onward. There may have been some licensing from Acklode but that would only get back to the Don't Stop album (see what I did there).\n\nBMG own all of the PYE material, Universal own the majority of the 70s up until the mid 2000s material. I'll have to check what Quo own, as I do have a spreadsheet.\n\nAs far as I know, Porter wants Quo to own all of the material. Whether he is actually buying it back bit-by-bit I've not a clue. D Walker was stupid to sell the catalogue in the 90s when he did, but he was all about the money. Quo probably were given the opportunity by Phonogram to own it all, which would explain why Rossi had various archival bits in his home studio.\n\nPost by MrWaistcoat on\n\nWho apart from us would be interested whilst a band called Starus Quo continue to make records ? That boat sailed an age ago......sadly. Last chance saloon was 2014.\n\nLike I've put here on Spotify alone, Quo had 13.5 million listens in 2021. Demand is there, agreed not for new music\n\nI think Francis is going to be hugely interested if they can sell some or all of the back catalogue, they certainly aren't making good money from downloads / streams\n\nWas astonished on youtube to see that a performance of Army from about 4 years had over 20 million views !!"
