        "text": "For the last seven years or so, I’ve been writing about the music, musicians, albums & songs that I love. Lately I’ve found myself hitting something of a roadblock when putting these articles together, usually when exploring a topic from the 1970s. Using the term ‘Heavy Metal’ in a 1970s context used to come naturally and feel completely appropriate to me; but lately I find myself questioning it’s validity in a 1970s context. I’m sensing some kind of shift has been underway in the historical understanding of Heavy Metal, and it’ troubles me. What gives? Why do I now frequently find myself musing, ‘wait, is it Metal, or is it Hard Rock?’ The answer to that question may well depend on when you were born.\n\nMy Heavy Metal fandom started in 1978; I was 14 years old. As I started to develop my tastes and buying records as they were released, I also started buying music that appeared before my Metal awakening. My own tastes and personal understanding of the genre led me to the conclusion that Metal became a ‘thing’ in 1968. If I had to pick The First Heavy Metal Band, I’d choose Blue Cheer; First Heavy Metal Album: Blue Cheer’s ‘Vincebus Eruptum’. I understand that the rest of the world seems to have settled on Black Sabbath’s 1970 debut as Ground Zero for Metal. And I totally get that.\n\nIn my view, 1978 was Heavy Metal’s tenth anniversary year. A lot of growth occurred in Metal’s first decade; we went from The Yardbirds’ version of ‘The Train Kept a’ Rollin’ to Judas Priest’s pulverizing ‘Hell Bent For Leather’. As a kid in ’78, the ‘heaviest’ record I had ever heard was Sabbath’s ‘Master of Reality’; possibly Van Halen’s debut. Maybe AC/DC’s ‘Let There Be Rock’? I, like many others, kept searching for records that would outdo those records on the Richter Scale. And as Metal evolved, we got our wish. Heavy Metal got heavier. And heavier.\n\nThat’s the thing about Heavy Metal; if things get stagnant or stale, it re-invents itself. I’ve been lucky enough to witness the birth of several new sounds, styles, and significant sub-genres in realtime, while following Metal’s twisted path, and if you’re my age, you have too: NWOBHM, Thrash, Death, Black… Ok, yes, also Hair Metal and Nu Metal. So after fifty years of steady evolution, today’s Heavy Metal (or, as it’s more commonly referred to today as simply ‘Metal’) is so far removed from the Metal of 1978 that the fourteen year old inside me is often stunned whenever I put the ol’ iPod on shuffle, and hear Nazareth segue into Napalm Death; Van Halen into Vader.\n\nBut can both Y&T and Carcass really inhabit the same genre? Well, yes and no. A funny thing happened on the way to 2020: As Metal evolved into new and different sonic and stylistic territories, it began to shed an entire era of it’s history; a significant chunk of what was inarguably considered ‘Heavy Metal’ in the 1970s is being re-labeled as ‘Hard Rock’, a change that minimizes much of the heavy music produced during the first decade of Metal’s evolution and would leave modern fans’ understanding of the genre and it’s history incomplete and seriously skewed.\n\nOnly someone who was a Metalhead in the 70’s would be aware of this subtle change in terminology. If you’re aged 40 or under, you’re probably unaware of this creeping category shift; to you, the Fast, loud, n’ hard music of the 70s is probably known to you as ‘Hard Rock’. The average 20-something Metal fan of today would laugh probably in your face if you referred to Aerosmith as a Heavy Metal band. But if you grew up in the 70s, you know that this was exactly how they were classified. Is Thin Lizzy Heavy Metal? Depends on how old you are. The truth is they were, but now, it’s suddenly debatable.\n\nSo what’s happening? Clearly, the Heavy Metal of the 70s is so different from the Metal of the new millennium, that modern fans couldn’t reconcile the two sounds falling under the same umbrella, and decided en masse that the genre boundaries needed to be re-drawn. Obviously Metal music of the 70’s hasn’t changed, only the category to which we might assign it. The sole exception seems to be Black Sabbath, who will probably never lose their Heavy Metal status, due to being widely regarded as the inventors of the genre, but other 70’s Heavy-weights still considered Metal today have begun sporting the ‘proto-‘ prefix before their descriptor. There’s been no coordinated plan, no petition, no agreed-upon date for this change; it’s occurring gradually, organically. For a student of the genre, it’s a fascinating phenomenon.\n\nIronically, we might consider 1980 and the rise of the NWOBHM to be the cut-off point. It seems as if, at some point after the turn of the millennium, most of the Metal bands of the pre-NWOBHM era (otherwise known as ‘The 1970s’) found their Metal cred in question. I say it’s ironic because the term ‘New Wave of British Heavy Metal’ implies that there was a previous wave of British Heavy Metal. And of course, there was; Queen, UFO, Budgie, Rainbow, Judas Priest all existed before the NWOBHM. But here again, most of these bands are being re-christened as ‘Hard Rock’. But the NWOBHM makes sense as new genre boundary, as after the passage of several generations, the era of the genre’s rebirth becomes regarded as the era of it’s birth.\n\nDo I sound like an ageing fan with a fading memory? Are there readers out there who were born sometime in the 70s, or after, who are thinking ‘this guy is nuts; Hard Rock is Hard Rock and Heavy Metal is Heavy Metal!’ I’m here to tell you it wasn’t always that way. And I can prove it. No, I’m not going to refer you to the internet, where the vast majority fof the content was likely generated after this HR/HM shift began. No, to confirm this, we need access to a static, unchanging source of information, one contemporary to the time period in question: that old pile of Circus and CREEM magazines in my basement. Watch your head.\n\nSome context: When I joined the party in ’78, and just before the NWOBHM breathed new life into the tired warhorse called Heavy Metal, the genre’s popularity was at it’s lowest ebb. Metal seemed spent, and was suffering an identity crisis after assaults from Disco, Punk Rock and New Wave. and the vast majority of Metal’s Heavy-weights chose to take the year off and release live albums. Metal fans were fewer in number but as dedicated as ever, but the rock press knew that the genre was in serious trouble. The situation was so dire that in May of 1978, a Circus Magazine cover blurb asked “Can Heavy Metal Survive the 70s?” music journo Robert Smith took the opportunity to wonder “Can Kiss, Queen, Led Zep and Nugent keep Growing?”\n\nA year later, CREEM Magazine took this a step further, asking “Is Heavy Metal Dead?” in their October 1979 issue. In this article, which was described as a ‘eulogy’ in that issue’s table of contents, one of CREEM’s more irreverent writers, the legendary Rick Johnson, submitted a rundown of all the ‘relevant’ Metal bands of the era and provided his thumbnail assessment of each group’s worth. It’s a hilarious piece; Johnson’s sarcastic style was always entertaining. Looking back at this article, and at the Circus article from the previous year, provides a snapshot of which bands were widely considered Heavy Metal near the end of the 70s.\n\nHere’s a round-up of the bands included in both the Circus article and the CREEM piece:\n\nLed Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Kiss, Aerosmith, Blue Oyster Cult, Ted Nugent, Monstrose, Van Halen, Rush, UFO, AC/DC, Rainbow, Queen, Nazareth, Judas Priest, Whitesnake, Foghat, Thin Lizzy, Status Quo, Uriah Heep, Budgie, Bad Company, Boston, Pat Travers Band, Wishbone Ash, Heart, The Dictators, Molly Hatchet, Mahogany Rush, Starz, Angel, The Godz, The Runaways, & REO Speedwagon.\n\nSure, decades later, it’s easy to agree that many of the covered bands should no longer be considered Heavy Metal –the fact that REO was included pleads the case for their urgent re-classification; no way in Hell can REO Speedwagon reside within the same musical category that Slayer did a decade later– but at in 78/79, they did. It helps to remember the context: This was Metal’s first decade of existence, and at that point in time, it didn’t get any heavier than this, folks. Deep Purple did not exist in 1978/79, and Motorhead’s ‘Overkill’ record wasn’t released until May 1979, and when the CREEM article was published, it was virtually unheard outside of the UK and Europe.\n\nCREEM’s October 1980 issue, one year after presiding over the death of Heavy Metal, CREEM took note of the NWOBHM and Metal’s rapid resurgence with another feature article by Johnson called ‘Heavy Metal: Back From the Dead’. In addition to many of the bands featured in the 1979 article, the 1980 rundown included Scorpions, Blackfoot, Gamma, The Joe Perry Project, Triumph, and Humble Pie, along with a smattering of NWOBHM bands (although the tag ‘NWOBHM’ was not mentioned in the article). Again, if it looks a little odd seeing this bunch of bands referred to as Heavy Metal (Humble Pie?), it is what it is; that’s they way that it was.\n\nI also dug out a (coverless) Special Edition issue of Circus, cover dated Feb 1980, called Rock Legends. There’s an entire section of the mag covering Heavy Metal, and features articles on Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Blue Oyster Cult, and … Grand Funk Railroad. Was GFR a Heavy Metal Band? Circus Magazine, with sales and circulation in the 70’s second only to Rolling Stone, thought so. Apparently, Humble Pie met the 1980 criteria for Heavy Metal certification, before the goalposts started moving .\n\nSomehwere around the dawning of the new millenium, Metal Nation collectively/unconsciously decided that much of the Metal of the 70s wasn’t really Metal at all, and began to re-assign it to the Hard Rock category, and undertook a major re-write of Metal history. Maybe it started back in the 90s, when Metal split into endless sub-genres and fans needed a scorecard to keep track. But it IS happenning; right under our noses, 70’s Heavy Metal is quietly getting demoted, downgraded… diminished. The term ‘Heavy Metal’ indicates a genre seperate from any other; ‘Hard Rock’ reads like a sub-category of ‘Rock’. Yawn.\n\nI think genre tags, musical boundaries and categories are subjective and ultimately meaningless. That said, this shift will never be acknowledged by me as legitimate. I view Metal as a wide spectrum of sounds and styles. I can see no reason why any single ‘era’ of its history would need an etymological update. Perhaps I’m reluctant to see it change because I because I lived through it, I grew up with it; I’m emotionally invested in this era more than any other. So don’t drink the Kool Aid! If it was Heavy Metal then, it’s Heavy Metal now, dammit, it always will be and HEY YOU KIDS GET OFF MY LAWN!\n\nI few winters back I was working a liquidation for a major national retailer, and was asked by a customer if we had ‘Slade’s Christmas song’ on CD. She had a strong British accent, and I assume she was from the UK, perhaps visiting the States for the holidays. When I told her the store didn’t stock any Slade product, she looked confused. ‘You haven’t any Slade?’ she asked, this time over-pronouncing the band’s name, in case I misheard her the first time. I repeated my answer, and politely offered that while ‘Merry Christmas Everybody’ was a personal favorite of mine, Slade weren’t exactly a household name in America, remembered, if at all, for their fluke 1983 hit ‘Run Runaway’, or for supplying Quiet Riot with their 2 best-known songs, ‘Mama Weer All Crazee Now’ and ‘Cum on Feel The Noize’. She shook her head, no doubt thinking You Yanks just don’t get it, and said ‘No Slade! Amazing! Well, cheers!’ and off she went.\n\nSlade OWNED the singles charts in the UK from 1971-1975. In that 4-year period, they released a staggering 17 consecutive Top Twenty singles; 12 of which went Top 5, including 6 that hit #1. Six number one singles on four years… They were the first UK band to have 3 singles enter the chart at #1. By contrast, here in the US the band had only 4 singles that broke into the Top 100 during that same period; the highest of which reached #68. And at the height of their success in Britain, Slade made a concerted effort to break in the states by touring through the 2nd half of 1975 and the bulk of ’76 with the likes of Aerosmith, ZZ Top and Black Sabbath, to little avail. While the touring scored them points with concert goers in several major US cities, US radio never got behind Slade. In the US in the 70’s, radio play was make-or-break.\n\nPity; most of their early records are a hoot. Slade had a way with a ‘rousing chorus’, a infectious, football chant musicality and an all-inclusive generosity of spirit. Their music was custom built for audience participation. And, while they were capable of throwing in a pop balled here, a novelty song there, overall they rocked quite hard for the era. Noddy Holder was a world-class belter, with a voice that could peel paint, and they had one monster musician in bassist Jim Lea. There’s an awful lot of Slade in early Kiss, and tons of other bands from various genres have name-checked them as an influence. Cheap Trick covered “When the Lights Are Out” just a few years ago. Their glammy image would have fit into what was going on in the States nicely. One wonders: Why would a crap band like Quiet Riot have 2 consecutive hits with Slade songs that had previously failed completely in the US? What’s up with that? Were Slade simply ‘too British’? Or was it because they couldn’t spell?\n\nIf you’re interested, I recommend you check out the compilation ‘Get Yer Boots On’ (I hate recommending comps, but this one includes all of their non-lp singles, which are excellent and a huge part of the Slade story), their 2nd full-length, “Slayed”, or their ‘wilderness era’ album, aptly titled “Whatever Happened To Slade?”\n\nThe debate over who originated twin guitar harmonies, or who first popularized their use, will likely never be settled. Anyway, who cares? Most of the bands that made that particular trope famous (Maiden, Lizzy, etc) will tell you they copped it from Wishbone Ash.\n\nWishbone Ash’s sound was an interesting amalgam of prog, folk and hard rock. Don’t let the ‘folk’ tag scare you; this was the most interesting element of their sound: folk music played with electric guitars.\n\nLead guitarists Andy Powell and Ted Turner were well ahead of their time, not only in their development of harmonized leads but also in the intricate guitar arrangements found in just about every song. Both displayed a deft touch and knew when to crank it up and when to turn it down. Powell and Turner were arguably the finest pre-Thin Lizzy two-guitar team in hard rock, paving the way for many bands to follow. (See how carefully I worded that last sentence?)\n\nWishbone Who? Ash’s first 8 albums placed in the UK Top 40. Their 3rd record, entitled ‘Argus’, widely regarded as their finest hour, charted in the UK at #3, and earned the band both ‘Album of the Year’ award from Sounds magazine, and ‘British Album of the Year’ from Melody Maker in 1972. So, kind of a big deal. Here in America, however, Wishbone Ash made no impact at all, with only 2 of their records ever entering the Hot 100. Ironically, their classic-era material (certainly ‘Blowin’ Free’, from ‘Argus’) would fit in quite well on US classic rock radio today.\n\nWhile neither heavy nor metal, Wishbone Ash clearly influenced several notable metal bands (hello, UFO) and iconic players (hey there, Michael Schenker). And make no mistake: their recorded output contains its fair share of certified (if under-recognized) hard rock classics; the epic ‘Phoenix’ from their 1970 debut comes to mind. Still, I suppose one might need to hear some music to fully grasp the Ash’s unique approach to 70’s hard rock, so I suggest the curious start with the aforementioned ‘Argus’. A rich combination of delicate guitar, intricate arrangements, soaring lead guitars, and sweeping progressive reach, ‘Argus’ is a classic of early British hard rock. From there, I’d hit 1974’s ‘There’s The Rub’, criminally under-rated record that showcases one of my favorite bass players ever, lead vocalist Martin Turner, and closes with the amazing instrumental ‘F.U.B.B.’ If it’s the crunchier stuff that you’re looking for, 1977’s ‘No Smoke Without Fire’ and 1980’s ‘Just Testing’ present with a much more dense, metallic sound, and are also recommended.\n\nAnyone reading this remember the 1967 hit (US #12) single by The Status Quo, “Pictures of Matchstick Men”? Yeah, groovy song, man. Too bad they were never able to follow it up… Depending on which continent you reside on, Status Quo was either a one-hit-wonder, or one of the most successful, long-lived rock bands of all time. Scoring a mammoth 60 UK chart hits, 22 of which reached the Top Ten, Quo have spent more cumulative time on the UK singles charts than the Beatles: 200 weeks. 25 of their 30 studio albums have seen the inside of the UK Top 40; 17 of those made the Top 10, including their 2013 album (#10!). Racking up 4 decades-plus of monstrous chart success, Status Quo is hard rock royalty in Britain and Europe. In the US? Nada.\n\nIf the only Quo music you’ve ever heard was “…Matchstick Men”, you’ll be floored by the band they became just 4 records later. It only took a few years for Status Quo to transform from British psychedelic pop princes into the heads down, hard-rocking machine they remain to this day. Imagine if Rush’s ‘2112’ and ‘Hold Your Fire’ albums were just 4 years apart, and you have some idea of the drastic stylistic change. The ‘look’ changed as well; gone were the colorful Carnaby Street clothes and acid trip album covers, replaced by jeans and T-shirts and earthy, street level imagery. No one who has heard their first live album ‘Quo Live’ could ever accuse them of faking it; the passion and commitment on display is palpable. Status Quo had finally a music that they felt and understood, and so took a left turn. Once Quo locked onto that 12-bar locomotive boogie rhythm, they never looked back. America, however, couldn’t be bothered.\n\nLike the Ramones, AC/DC and Motorhead, Quo have been accused for decades of making the same album of simple, unimaginative music over and over again, but the standard response from the faithful remains: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. In that regard, methinks their chart success speaks for itself. They’ve weathered the decades without changing their sound a whole lot, ignoring trends and sticking to what works, and are always amply rewarded by their British fans. That a band this ‘heavy’ had such success in the mainstream charts, in a music scene where what’s ‘fashionable’ changes every hour, on the hour, says a lot about the powerful loyalty of the British rock fan.\n\nDo yourself a favor; check out any of the ‘classic-era’ albums ‘Piledriver’, ‘Hello!’, ‘Quo’, ‘On the Level’, or ‘Blue for You’. It really doesn’t matter which one of them you chose, ‘cause they’re all the same anyway, right, mate?"
