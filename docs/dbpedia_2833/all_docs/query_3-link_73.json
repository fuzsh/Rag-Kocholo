        "text": "American education has faced persistent and disappointing challenges in the past few post-pandemic years, including high absenteeism, academic regression, behavioral issues, a widening achievement gap and students leaving the traditional public school system altogether. Opinion columnist David Brooks, in The New York Times article “America Should Be in the Middle of a Schools Revolution,” notes that teachers and students are grappling with altered realities that may persist for years.\n\nTo address these challenges and engage disenchanted students and parents, a viable solution exists: flex-based schools. These schools, also called hybrid schools, or in California, non-classroom-based schools, empower families and students to play a more active role in their education while providing personalized support and acceleration. Flex schools offer a dynamic schedule that adapts to each student’s evolving needs, promoting engagement and success.\n\nSprings Charter Schools’ flex-based programs in 17 physical sites in Southern California, including two in San Diego County, have been serving the region for more than 20 years, and we have been listed as one of a select few charter school networks that have made gains toward closing the achievement gap for students in typically underperforming groups. We are making a positive impact on students’ lives and providing valuable choices in education. What does this look like in practice? A high school student might take classes on campus three days per week and work at an internship two days per week while earning credit for that internship. A younger child might attend class four days per week and work on personalized assignments to accelerate her progress with her parents on the fifth day. And there are many more scenarios.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the widespread availability of technology and the changing landscape of education, the return to the traditional classroom model remains the norm for most public schools. California continues to make it difficult for public charter schools to operate flexible schools like ours — case in point, the current moratorium on opening new non-classroom-based charter schools, even though the existing schools are popular and successful. This moratorium indicates the disinterest many in the traditional system have for new ideas. The old guard would prefer we would just go away, but our students and parents keep us going.\n\nHere are five compelling reasons why flex-based schools should become the new standard in American education:\n\n1. Personalized learning paths: Flex schools prioritize individualized education. Unlike traditional schools, where all students receive the same assignments and are given the same amount of time to do them, flex students can customize their learning pace. Maybe the student needs 10 hours a week for math, but only three for history. Electronic tracking tools ensure students receive the necessary support, and teachers can monitor progress in real time at the touch of a button.\n\n2. Students pursue their passions: Flex-based schools allow students to explore their interests while staying on track academically. They can engage in community groups, sports and extracurricular activities without rigid time constraints. The freedom to choose fosters motivation and engagement across all age groups.\n\n3. Students are empowered: Flex students learn essential skills such as self-directed learning and time management because they have the autonomy to manage their schedules. Flex kids learn to manage time because they actually have time to manage. This empowerment extends beyond their compulsory schooling, preparing them for lifelong success.\n\n4. Flex students learn to be kinder and more inclusive: Flex schools reduce the social pressures often associated with traditional education. Students have choices regarding when and where they attend class, and smaller virtual groups create a supportive learning environment. For students with learning differences, flex-based schools provide essential flexibility.\n\n5. Real-world learning: Flex-based schools emphasize real-world applications. Students work with community experts, undertake internships, attend community college classes and initiate community projects during school hours. This practical approach enhances their education and prepares them for life beyond school\n\nFlex schools are truly the model of the future. They offer a balanced approach, combining personalization, flexibility and accountability, ultimately fostering student success and happiness. America’s education system must evolve to meet the needs of today’s learners and provide them with the tools to chase their dreams during school hours, rather than waiting for the end of the school day for “real” learning to occur.\n\nHermsmeyer is superintendent of Springs Charter Schools and lives in Vista."
