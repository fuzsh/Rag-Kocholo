        "text": "The iconic Status Quo has release the first volume of the new ‘Official Archive Series‘ brought to you by earMUSIC. ‘Vol. 1 – Live In Amsterdam’ is available from today, 11 August 2023, on strictly limited and numbered CD and vinyl editions, as well as on digital formats. As with each forthcoming release in this series, this official and fully endorsed recording features a carefully curated selection of iconic Status Quo performances, including classic hits spanning their extensive catalogue, deep cuts, and fan favourites. Each track is a testament to the band’s enduring popularity and musical prowess.\n\nThe next volume will be released in November and was recorded in London, so keep your eyes peeled!\n\nThe ‘Official Archive Series’ will offer exceptional sound quality and great packaging throughout, featuring photography by Christie Goodwin.\n\nThe Series has been freshly mixed and mastered by Eike Freese and Laurin Halberstadt at Chameleon Studios Hamburg.\n\n‘Vol. 1 – Live In Amsterdam’ was recorded in the Dutch capital on 19 October 2010 on the band’s ‘Pictures Exposed World Tour’. The setlist at the Heineken Hall was representative of the rest of the ‘Pictures Exposed World Tour’ with the line-up of Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt, Andrew Bown, John ‘Rhino’ Edwards and Matt Letley delivering an avalanche of Quo classics, as befitted a tour celebrating ‘40 Years of Hits’.\n\nGet it and listen to it here:\n\nhttps://StatusQuo.lnk.to/ArchiveVol1PR\n\nThe first release sets the bar high for what is due to follow, but each album in the Status Quo ‘Official Archive Series’ captures the raw energy and infectious enthusiasm of a Status Quo live performance; no matter where in the world. With their trademark sound, powerful guitar riffs, and irresistible hooks, the band delivers an unadulterated rock ’n’ roll experience, and this collectible series is a great way to celebrate one of the greatest live acts ever.\n\nMore information:\n\nwww.ear-music.net/status-quo-catalogue\n\nFormats:\n\nLtd. 2CD Digipak\n\nLtd. 3LP (Black Vinyl/180g/Gatefold)\n\nDigital\n\nTrack listing:\n\nCD 1\n\nIntro\n\nCaroline\n\nSomething ‘Bout You Baby I Like\n\nRain\n\nDon’t Drive My Car\n\nMean Girl\n\nSofter Ride\n\nBeginning Of The End\n\nHold You Back\n\nThe Proposing Medley\n\nThe Oriental\n\nCreepin’ Up On You\n\nCD 2\n\nLiving On An Island\n\nIn The Army Now\n\nDrum Solo\n\nRoll Over Lay Down\n\nDown Down\n\nWhatever You Want\n\nRockin’ All Over The World\n\nJunior’s Wailing\n\nRock ‘N’ Roll Music / Bye Bye Johnny"
