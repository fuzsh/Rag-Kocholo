        "text": "earMUSIC / Eagle Rock proudly announces\n\nSTATUS QUO\n\nBULA QUO!\n\nMore than “just” a new studio album by British rock icons Status Quo!\n\nOne CD with Quo’s new album\n\nSecond Disc with all their hits as heard in the spy-comedy movie Bula Quo!, starring the band\n\n~2CD and Digital Audio Out July 9~\n\nNew York, NY (May 29, 2013)—Experience classic rock artists Status Quo as you’ve never encountered them before. On July 9 2013, the band will release their new double album, Bula Quo! via earMUSIC/Edel/Eagle Rock Entertainment [MSRP $17.98].\n\nBula Quo! has been inspired by their incredible adventures filming their first ever feature-film of the same title. The first disc features nine brand new tracks, written as the soundtrack for the duo’s madcap escapades in the movie. Disc 2 contains exclusive reworked studio songs or live versions of 10 classic Quo hits, which are also featured in the film (including an amazing Fijian-style rendition of “Living On An Island”).\n\nStatus Quo is enjoying an exciting phase in their long and successful career, after the critical acclaim and the support received by their loyal audience for their previous studio album Quid Pro Quo and the relative tour. The 90-minute action movie Bula Quo! features the band as themselves and stars Craig Fairbrass [Cliff Hanger, Rise Of The Footsoldier, Eastenders] and Laura Aikman [Keith Lemon The Movie, Freight, Surviving Picasso] with Jon Lovitz [Saturday Night Live, The Critic, Friends, The Wedding Singer]. The film was directed by Stuart St. Paul, who has worked on projects ranging from Duran Duran’s seminal “Wild Boys” video, to Aliens, Batman and three James Bond films. The movie will hit the stores and theaters soon after summer.\n\n“Making the film in Fiji was a fantastic experience and we couldn’t help but be inspired by our surroundings,” states vocalist/lead guitarist Francis Rossi. “We had no plans to write and release a new studio album as well as filming our parts for the movie, it just happened.”\n\nAdds singer/rhythm guitarist Rick Parfitt: “We hope that Quo fans will enjoy the film, which is certainly something new for the band, but we know they are going to love the music.”\n\nAs the new material sounds inspired and fresh, it is one album not to be missed and the film is destined to become a cult for Quo fans. For everybody else… Bula Quo! will “simply” be one of their strongest releases ever!\n\nwww.statusquo.co.uk www.ear-music.net www.youtube.com/earMUSICofficial www.facebook.com/earmusicofficial\n\nEagle Rock Entertainment is the largest producer and distributor of music programming for DVD, Blu-Ray, TV, Audio and Digital Media in the world.
