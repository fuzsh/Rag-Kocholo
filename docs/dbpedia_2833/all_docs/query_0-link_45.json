        "text": "By Stephanie Shirk, Asst. to the Editor-in-chief\n\nBlink-182 released their eighth album “NINE” on Sept. 20. This was the band’s first release in three years.\n\nThe group’s prior release was “California” in 2016. While “California” paid decent homage to their classic rough-punk sound, “NINE” plays more with electronic beats and pop-influenced vibes.\n\nSlick riffs accompany fewer of their tracks than ever and we find each song contributing less to what the band is rooted in. “No Heart To Speak Of” offers the sound familiar that Blink’s original fan base fell in love with in the nineties, when punk was at its popularity peak.\n\nQuick beats and hot tempos are heard through screams of Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba in “Ransom,” something that fans may also find appealing and familiar.\n\nHowever, “Darkside,” which was released earlier this year as a single, alludes to a more popular pop-punk sound, indicating a possible pull for a younger audience. The same can be said for “Pin the Grenade,” which is another of the album’s 15 tracks that allude to being in love with someone who wants nothing to do with you.\n\nI will say that “Heaven” holds a beautiful message for its audience. It pays tribute to bass guitarist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Matt Skiba’s recent advocation for public safety in spaces such as bars and schools.\n\nThe song “Heaven” originated from drummer Travis Barker’s rattling experience of being less than two miles from a mass shooting near his home in 2018, according to interview from The Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe songs of “NINE” are more pop-centered than the band’s earlier releases. Having risen to popularity in the nineties, it stands to reason that the band’s core sound has changed over the years.\n\nThe band is on the up-and-up, possibly for the better. I think the band’s efforts to create a new-age sound for themselves is commendable; it’ll be interesting to see where they go from here, and how they’ll try to adjust their sound in upcoming albums to keep the pop vibes they’ve given their listeners with “NINE,” or try to retreat back to their usual, punk roots."
