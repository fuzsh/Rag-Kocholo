        "text": "Shortly after the announcement of the ‘Official Archive Series Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’, Status Quo releases the first audio-visual appetizer, the evergreen ‘Paper Plane’ This song is the perfect soundtrack to forget the daily grind! At a Status Quo concert, ‘Paper Plane’ isn’t just a song, it’s a launchpad. The lights pulse, the crowd roars, and with the first riff, everyone takes flight. This version captures that raw energy, taken from the upcoming ‘Official Archive Series Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’, which is available now on all digital platforms, along with a lyric video. Francis Rossi belts out the chorus, and a wave of pure joy washes over the venue. Strangers transform into a singing, swaying mass, united by the soaring spirit of the track. Live music magic!\n\nThe ‘Official Archive Series’ offers exceptional sound quality and great packaging throughout, featuring photography by Christie Goodwin. The Series has been freshly mixed and mastered by Eike Freese and Laurin Halberstadt at Chameleon Studios Hamburg.\n\n‘Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’ was recorded on Sunday 22 June 2008 as part of the ‘In Search Of The Fourth Chord’ UK tour. This was the tenth show of the year, and was part of the ‘Forest Live’ initiative by the Forestry Commission, and in fact, was a return to the venue for the band who had performed a short run of ‘Forest Live’ shows as part of the ‘Heavy Traffic’ tour of 2003.\n\n‘Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’ is a further release from the Status Quo ‘Official Archive Series’ presenting the raw energy and infectious enthusiasm of a Status Quo live performance; no matter where in the world. With their trademark sound, powerful guitar riffs, and irresistible hooks, the band delivers an unadulterated rock ’n’ roll experience, and this collectible series is a great way to celebrate one of the greatest live acts of all time.\n\nStatus Quo – Official Archive Series Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum\n\nAlbum release: 12 June 2024\n\nFormats:\n\nLtd. 2CD Digipak\n\nLtd. 3LP (Black Vinyl/180g/Gatefold)\n\nDigital\n\nTRACKLISTING\n\nCD 1\n\n1.
