The fourth disc delivers a generous selection of A-Sides, B-Sides, demos and outtakes before the fifth and final disc completes the story of this era with 18 further tracks from various BBC radio sessions.\n\nThe discs are presented in a clamshell box and come with a 40-page booklet with extensive sleevenotes and loads of images of memorabilia from this era, drawn from the band’s own archive.\n\nThe Early Years (1966-1969) will be released on 15 March 2024 via BMG.\n\nTracklisting\n\nThe Early Years 1966-1969 Status Quo /\n\nCD 1: Picturesque & Spare Parts – Original Mono
