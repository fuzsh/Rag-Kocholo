        "text": "“Brat summer” is upon us. We're dancing at the club until sunrise − unabashedly, of course. Painting our nails neon green. Working it out on the remix. Staying up late having an existential crisis and loving our lives anyway. We’re everywhere, we’re so Julia.\n\nEven Vice President Kamala Harris is embracing it.\n\nConfused? For those of you who are not chronically online, we can clue you in to the phenomenon that has taken over pop listeners since the release of Charli XCX’s album \"BRAT\" on June 7, which has fans declaring this is a \"Brat summer.\" USA TODAY called the album an embrace of “a hot-mess pop star aesthetic, prioritizing club culture at its core but still offering introspective lyrics on aging, womanhood, grief and anxiety.” That's a good starting place to understanding what this trend is all about.\n\nIn a TikTok interview, Charli XCX broke down her definition of the word \"brat\": “You are just that girl who is a little messy and maybe says dumb things sometimes, who feels herself but then also maybe has a breakdown but parties through it. It is honest, blunt and a little bit volatile. That’s Brat.”\n\nWhat is a brat summer?\n\nBrat summer is the lifestyle associated with being a \"brat,\" and not in the way you may think. Charli XCX fans aren't throwing tantrums like a badly behaved child; being a brat to them means indulging in pleasure and not concerning yourself with societal expectations. Rather than conforming to the status quo − on matters of aging, clean living or etiquette − brats focus more on having fun, embracing their community and unapologetically embracing individuality.\n\nOne of the trademark mantras of brat summer is to be \"so Julia,\" a reference to Charli's song \"360\" and actress and model Julia Fox, who was featured in the single's music video. On the Zach Sang Show, Fox said being \"so Julia\" means \"just being that girl.\"\n\nIt's \"being confident, putting yourself out there, being out, being about, being the center of attention.\"\n\nDressing for a brat summer: Y2K fashion and green galore\n\nBrat summer also uses fashion as cultural signifiers, uplifting styles that are bold, colorful and sometimes provocative, often inspired by Gen Z’s revival of Y2K fashion.\n\nAccording to Charli, the brat summer essentials can go \"luxury or trashy.\" There are no specific rules for how to dress, because being a brat is all about embracing your individuality. But if there were to be a dress code, there would probably be a lot of Von Dutch trucker hats, baby tees and \"strappy white tank tops,\" paired with low-rise jorts or a miniskirt.\n\nBrat is also a color: slime green. Clothing and makeup brands have gotten on board, pushing out their green products through \"BRAT\"-themed marketing techniques. ColourPop Cosmetics posted a guide for \"brat inspired makeup\" with their \"lime green faves.\" Kate Spade shared a \"brat summer starter pack\" with green purses, hats and swimwear. And athleisure brand Adanola has teased a \"brat summer collection\" with the caption \"BRAT, but make it Adanola.\"\n\n'Let's work it out on the remix': Lorde, Charli XCX’s viral moment and the truth about friendship breakups\n\nWho else is embracing a brat summer?\n\nA TikTok dance to Charli's song \"Apple\" has made waves on TikTok, with celebrities and influencers like the cast of \"Twisters\" (Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar Jones and Anthony Ramos), Jake Shane and Alix Earle, \"Chicken Shop Date\" host Amelia Dimoldenberg, Matty Healy's fiance Gabbriette and Ashley Tisdale all showing off their moves.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday and endorsed Kamala Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee, Charli put her endorsement behind Harris as well, tweeting, \"kamala IS brat.\"\n\nKamala HQ has embraced the brat aesthetic, rebranding the Biden-Harris HQ to Kamala HQ with a brat themed header on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nNo one does brat summer better than Charli herself\n\nThe pop singer, 31, has had her own brat summer as well, entwining debauchery and classiness. From hosting DJ sets with her friends, including Addison Rae, Julia Fox and fiance George Daniel of The 1975, in Brooklyn, London, Ibiza and Glastonbury, to watching tennis matches at Wimbledon, Charli is showing that a brat can have it all.\n\nWhile celebrities and influencers are all taking part in brat summer, you just can't beat the original. As Charli sings on \"Von dutch\": \"It's OK to just admit that you're jealous of me / You're obsessing, just confess it 'cause it's obvious.\""
