Francis nailed the solo and then made it even better than the original.\n\nThe track seems to have always divided opinion more than I'd have expected. I have seen the odd negative post about it over the years.\n\nPost by railroad007 on\n\nI'd heard Paper Plane on TOTP, been given the album by my brothers friend who thought I might like it, listened to Don't Waste My Time and then was confirmed as a Quo fan by Oh Baby, as soon as the \"Piledriving\" riff kicked in after the quiet build up that was that for me...A whole 5 minutes since my first sticking the album on, didn't finish the song first time around,skipped back to the intro and the riff at least 10 times before Rossi sang a note! I always wanted to hear it played live, I did and it was still the original Piledriving song. I like to think that the guitar solo and the middle part are the inspiration for the album title.\n\nThey were perfection back then, If they only made one album and fcuked off Piledriver was good enough."
