        "text": "Hi maidenpriest,\n\nI used to like them in my youth back in the 70's, but don't care much for their music now. They're still very popular here in Holland and they draw quite a crowd in the more rural eastern part of the country, which is where most of their fans live, obviously.\n\nI only have one album - a comp that gives a good overview of all their records and hits IMO. It's called The very best of, but it has a different cover than their Whatever you want Best Of comp, which is readily available everywhere.\n\nThe tracklisting of my comp is also slightly different, though not all that much. My 2cd doesn't have Accident prone, which was one of my favourites back in the day.\n\nWhen it comes to song selection, you really can't go wrong with that Whatever you want comp - judge for yourself by this link;\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Whatever-You-Want-Very-Status/dp/B000006X92\n\nIf it's the same mastering as my comp (which is possible, I only bought it a year ago or so), the music doesn't really come off great sound-wise, but I guess that's also because of the recording itself.\n\nIt struck me, though, that the sound is much better from the track Rocking all over the world onwards. But again, that's probably got to do with those recordings themselves. I remember that, at the time of the Rocking all over the world album (1977), it was the first time they hired an outside producer (Pip Williams) and their sound really improved in comparision to their earlier albums.\n\nFor your interest, there's also this 3 CD comp that's only available as an import (from Holland).\n\nhttp://www.nl.bol.com/is-bin/INTERS...t?BOL_OWNER_ID=1000004003083233&Section=MUSIC\n\nTracklisting seems ok too, and it comes with some nice bonuses on the third disc. Still, none of the comps I've seen seems to contain your favourite song Forty-five times. I guess most of their comps focus on the hit singles.\n\nThere are approximately a gazillion status quo compilations (half of them featuring just material from their Pye years, so just the first four albums) so I doubt anyone apart from the most diehard fan would be able to give a comparison of all of them.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t bother with a comp at all – the quo’s albums between 1970-76 are incredibly underrated, and their continued recording activity since then has done much to tarnish their reputation.\n\nNo they may never have been cool, but once upon a time they were one of the country’s, nay the world’s foremost rock bands. They weren’t just the comfortable rock/pop act that people see them as today, they really did rock out with the best of them.\n\nJust my opinion – not much help on the compilation front though, I’m afraid!\n\nif you look at my link above (have a look! it wont hurt you!) 4500 times is on disc three. though the song is about 10 minutes long and there's 18 songs on disc 3 so i dunno how they fitted it all on. hmmm...just listened to the clip and it sounds like the live version which is 16 mins long.\n\nanyways, i doubt there's another comp featuring the song.\n\nyou could get the original album - 1973's Hello!, also featuriing Caroline - but for me, its their most tame album of their classic period, 4500 Times aside.\n\nIf you like Caroline, and you know you like 4500 Times, you might as well go buy Hello! and then everything else from 1970-76 (77 including the live album).\n\nDont fear the Quo!\n\nI did look at your link thanks for this reason you have stated i am supicious it is edited down also i love 'picture's of' which is not their?\n\nAlthough it doesn't contain \"4500 Times\", certainly the most fun compilation is 12 Gold Bars. Not only does the 80's CD of this sound great (kind of up there with the original CD of Queen's Greatest Hits - vinyl copies of 12 Gold Bars are variable), it is still available, for peanuts...\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Twelve-Gold...4887858?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1197578019&sr=8-1\n\nIt would be a shame to overlook it. Mind you, once you get into the eighties, I'm definately the wrong person to ask about the Quo ...\n\nAs for Pye compilations, grab any that contain Mean Girl, and version 2 of Gerdundula (both from \"Dog Of Two Head\" - not version 1, which was the B-Side of In My Chair). You need to hear these two songs at the very least. If you come across a \"Castle Classics\" copy of DOTH, that's the best sounding version. There was a PRT version which also sounded great, but it got the running order wrong, and was only in print for a couple of years, so is pretty scarse...\n\nToo right! Ma Kelly's is a great album, though if i'm being totally honest i think i prefer Spare Parts so to me its kind of dip but in light of what their change of direction turned them into i have no complaints whatsoever.\n\nIs It Really Me / Gotta Go Home is one of the greastest Quo songs of all time. In fact, one of the greatest rock songs of all time.\n\nand to think, early 70s live versions sometimes lasted for about 30 minutes!\n\ni was born 30 years too late.....\n\ni've just ordered another version of the Ma Kelly's album, the one with the BBC session bonus tracks.\n\nI have no idea how it will sound, but i dont care to be honest as im just after the session tracks.\n\nyep! i have heard a lot of rock music over my 36 years and that playing is very good, what would you call that style 'boogie rock'? i just wish the fans would stop doing that stupid 'drunk headbut' dance, but i guess that dance has a whole history to it, and for its time it was coooooollllll??"
