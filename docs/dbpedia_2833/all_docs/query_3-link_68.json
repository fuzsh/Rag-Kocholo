        "text": "Some rabbis inspire their worshippers with fiery sermons.\n\nFred Pomerantz played the congas.\n\nPomerantz — a trained musician before he began his religious career — was spiritual leader for 32 years of one of Bergen County's biggest Reform congregations, Temple Beth El of Northern Valley. He died last month at age 84, but his legacy lives on as a musical innovator who brought a fresh, jazzy sensibility to Jewish worship. Originally from western Pennsylvania, the rabbi known in his youth as \"Freddy with the the drums\" sought to make ancient liturgy more accessible to new generations. Starting in the late 1960s, he collaborated with Grammy-winning performers, turned his services into a jazz-rock album and took his musical concoction on the road to synagogues across the country.\n\n\"Music is this universal way to bring people together,\" said Pomerantz's daughter, Rebecca Shinder, who grew up near the temple in Closter and followed in her father's footsteps as a rabbi. \"It's a way to have people understand prayers they previously recited by rote. Nothing about this service is rote.\"\n\nPomerantz led Temple Beth El in Closter from 1973 to 2005. He died on July 8 at Englewood Hospital.\n\nHe was fluent in music long before he became fluent in the Bible. Growing up in a small town, he played for school bands, for the local summer stock playhouse and in town parades. He paid his way through college by playing drums and booking bands at Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nBut he eventually realized his true calling and was ordained at Hebrew Union College in New York in 1968.\n\nConnecting to new generation with 'Sim Shalom'\n\nHe returned to Pennsylvania that year to serve at Rodef Shalom, a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Early on, he noticed that many young Jews didn't feel connected to the formal tunes their parents and grandparents sang at temple.\n\nDetermined to change that, he started incorporating jazz rhythms into the traditional Sabbath prayer service, creating a program that he called \"Sim Shalom,\" Hebrew for \"grant us peace.\"\n\n\"It was such an unusual and healing service based on jazz music,\" said Marty Kasdan, past president of Temple Beth El. \"He put together a group of musicians and singers who did this huge event that drew people of all ages. It was beautiful! His goal was to bring music into the services and make it more approachable.\"\n\n\"He would lead the service as a rabbi and also serve as a drummer from the bimah,\" Kasdan said, using the Hebrew word for \"altar.\"\n\n\"Sim Shalom was a major event that would enhance the beauty and meaning of the service and would make you meditate and feel happy,\" Kasdan added. \"There were variations to it each time, with different performers. He also created other programs, like pre-service concerts with musicians who would also participate in the prayer services afterwards.\"\n\nIn a 2001 interview with The Record, Pomerantz said, \"When people are opening up and connecting to Judaism and their heritage, that's when I feel my best.\"\n\nPomerantz said he wanted to blend the timeless with the timely. In ancient times, Jews used musical instruments in prayer services at the holy temple in Jerusalem. But many, particularly in Orthodox and Conservative synagogues, stopped using instruments on the Sabbath after Jerusalem's Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in the first century. Most Reform temples, however, have long used choirs, organs and bands during services.\n\nA new album and a national tour\n\nIn 1971, Pomerantz turned his program into an album, \"Sim Shalom — Rock Jazz Service,\" to spread the message. He traveled to Reform temples across the U.S. and Canada with singers and bands, attracting a crowd of worshippers to celebrate the Sabbath with toe-tapping fervor.\n\nThe Central Conference of American Rabbis took notice and invited Pomerantz to join its liturgy committee, which wrote “Gates of Repentance\" and other prayer books published in the 1970s and used by over 1 million Reform Jews over the decades.\n\nHoward Shapiro, rabbi emeritus of Temple Israel in West Palm Beach, Florida, hosted a Sim Shalom performance in 2008.\n\n\"It was an attempt to give the liturgy contemporary components that would give it new meaning,\" he said. \"There have been folk interpretations and modern interpretations of the prayers, but this jazz innovation was something unique.\n\n\"It was partially like being at a jazz concert, but it was also sacred. Freddy was very creative,\" Shapiro said.\n\nJazz greats in the temple\n\nPomerantz brought in Grammy-winning jazz artists, such as the late Michael Renzi, Harry Allen and Annette Sanders. He wanted people to be active participants in prayer and to rethink the status quo, said Shinder, 52, the rabbi's daughter, who grew up in Closter and still lives there with her husband and children.\n\n\"I've had Jews and non-Jews tell me that this is something they didn't know they needed,\" said Shinder, the rabbi at Temple Beth Shalom in Florida, New York.\n\nMore: Artist from Teaneck draws acclaim for capturing trauma of Israel at war\n\nThroughout his career, she said, her father aspired to provide unique experiences, whether through creative spaces or a dimly lit sanctuary, through music or projected images on the sanctuary walls.\n\nWhen Pomerantz joined Rodef Shalom in Pittsburgh, he offered a stark contrast to the older leader on staff, she said. The coffeehouse Pomerantz created attracted both Jews and non-Jews to learn, sing and search for meaning together.\n\nAfter leaving Temple Beth El, Pomerantz served at Congregation Agudas Achim in Sullivan County, New York, from 2004 until his death.\n\nBut he kept up his Bergen County ties, At Temple Beth El, there was a Shabbat Unplugged Band that played monthly. Pomerantz performed in that ensemble well into his retirement, with his grandson joining him in the percussion section.\n\nFor Pomerantz, it wasn't just about making beautiful music, it was how he served his creator. \"It's my job to bring people to God.\" he told The Record years ago. \"I love doing that.\"\n\nDeena Yellin covers religion for NorthJersey.com.
