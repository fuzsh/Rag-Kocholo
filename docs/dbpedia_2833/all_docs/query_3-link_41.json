Waitasecond? While it’s not the same missile pictured on the two album covers, the visual link is obvious and shows that the two albums have more in common than Quo albums normally do. Another less obvious link can be made between the covers of RAOTW and NTL – both feature similar concepts with Planet Earth, the colours and the placement of the album title. While nobody had anticipated that “Never Too Late” would be the last album with John Coghlan, the band did seem to have decided it would be the last with John Eden – and his first album with the band (not as co-producer, but as engineer) was “Rockin’ All Over the World”.\n\nAlan later complained about basically making two albums at once, because the band didn't have enough songs. Most of the better stuff was already used on “Just Supposin’” (John Eden said they should have held back “Don't Drive My Car”… what NTL track would you switch it with?) and NTL was completed under somewhat suboptimal circumstances, sonically speaking. Also, the lack of musical variety is underlined by the fact that this time around, Francis ended up singing lead on all songs!\n\nAfter the release of the album, Quo finally went out on tour again. Since Andy Bown had been playing bass (his main instrument!) as part of the Surrogate Band for Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” shows in 1980 and 1981 (doubling up for Roger Waters when Rog needed to play act or play acoustic guitar), they postponed the start of the tour so Andy could fulfil his commitment. Andy went on to play organ on “The Final Cut” and Roger’s first solo album “The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking”.\n\nNever Too Late: Generic standard Quo but still played with a lot of oomph. The lyric is one of the more political ones in the Quo catalogue and its optimistic message is visualized by the cover.\n\nSomething 'Bout You Baby I Like: Quo have absolutely been playing this one to DEATH in the last couple of years but the studio version still has a charm of its own, despite the strange drum sounds overdubbed on top of the original track.\n\nTake Me Away: Unbelievable! One of the darkest, heaviest, most intense tracks ever released on a Status Quo album. Rick and Andy wrote it, but Francis sang it - and he really pulls out all the stops as a guitarist.\n\nFalling In Falling Out: A nice commercial number like Quo would produce dozens of from now on, but this one at least benefits from John Coghlan's drumming. It does get a bit repetitive near the end.\n\nCarol: A Chuck Berry cover isn't a bad idea if you play rock 'n' roll, but the sound doesn't work well with the song. And two cover versions after three albums without covers does suggest that the band was slightly lacking material (strange considering all those unused 1978/1979 songs, but whatever).\n\nLong Ago: This almost sounds as if Francis was trying to write his version of \"Rain\", a serious mid-tempo shuffle. It's probably one of the more overlooked tracks from the period.\n\nMountain Lady: Um, what is this? Yeah, I can hear a growing gap between Alan and the rest of the band. In fact, the more I think about it, Alan's \"departure\" a few years later probably was the only way Quo could survive if this is all he could come up with & he still wanted to steer the band in HIS direction. The suddenly hacked-off ending is bizarre but fits in well with the weird openings and endings heard throughout the LP.\n\nDon't Stop Me Now: I could just repeat what I said above, or repeat Alan's comments about unfinished material on NTL. This song certainly sounds unfinished to me, like a rough idea that desperately needed more work done on it to become an actual song. The way it appears on the album it feels more like something bridging two other songs, which it sort of does, actually.\n\nEnough is Enough: According to Francis, Rick had nothing to do with writing this song, which was rather obviously inspired by \"Stay With Me\" by The Faces. Like so many of the other songs from the era it seems to lack variation to my ears.\n\nRiverside: This has one of the strangest beginnings in music history! I know John Eden said that the drumming wasn’t done by a drum machine (instead he and Francis overdubbed electronic drum samples over a couple of tracks) but it surely sounds like it, there is no proper flow to the drumming and the fills are really awkward at times. This, along with the vocals being completely drowned in the mix, basically destroys a song that could have been great. It’s a shame because the song has a lot of potential, thanks to its chord structure and the rhythm switch from fast rock to a typical Quo shuffle. Now if only they had played this one (and several others from the JS/NTL complex) live… and added a guitar solo…\n\nBonus disc: Strangely, though 2 demo versions of “Mountain Lady” and a vocal outtake of “Falling In Falling Out” exist, neither is included – only the (nice) acoustic backing track of “Something ‘Bout You Baby I Like”. Plus…\n\nDer Superhit \"What You're Supposin'\" vom Album \"Just Proposin'\" ... not exactly, but this Austrian Flexidisc is hilarious. Especially if you are bilingual like me and have long since developed an allergy towards radio DJs with bad English.\n\nFinally, we get live recordings spread out across 2 CDs (a first for the deluxe series) but I have no idea why exactly this bootleg was chosen. According to the bootleg index, there are several better sounding concerts:\n\n· London, Hammersmith Odeon 12.3.1981 3+ AUD\n\n· London, Hammersmith Odeon 13.3.1981 3+/4- AUD (the better recording has less songs)\n\n· Le Mans, La Rotonde 25.3.1981 3+ AUD (parts of which were used for Just Supposin’)\n\n· Stockholm, Isstadion 4.4.1981 4 AUD\n\n· Udine, Palasport 27.4.1981 4 AUD\n\n· Cantu, Palasport Cucciago 30.4.1981 3+ AUD\n\n· Winterthur, Eulachhalle 2.5.1981 4 AUD\n\n· Madrid, Pavillon 8.5.1981 3+ AUD\n\n· Nantes, Palais de la Beaujoire 16.5.1981 4 AUD\n\n· Paris, Hippodrome de Pantin 18.5.1981 3+ FM\n\n· London, Wembley Arena 27.5.1981 4- AUD\n\nThat’s a whopping 11 recordings with supposedly better sound quality! Sure, most of these aren’t complete (given the length of the setlist, not surprising), but even the complete St. Austell concert isn’t here (“What You’re Proposing” and “In My Chair” are missing, even if they would have fit). I think it would have been a better idea to sequence a live album from the best recordings of each track, including “the longest 4500 times ever, 23:58” from Udine and “10 minutes drum solo (the longest ever)” from Paris.\n\nHaving said that, the St Austell recording isn’t horrible. As long as the fans are quiet, you can hear most of what happened on stage. It gives you a glimpse of what exactly the “Frantic Four plus one” were like live (yes, Andy played on the Live album as well, but there are more songs with keyboards here). One has to remember, though, that this was one of the first concerts on the tour and the band hadn’t played live for 1 ½ years (plus they had loads of new songs in the set – hence Francis mixing up the lyrics of “Something ‘Bout You Baby I Like”). I know that the Paris radio recording has a near-mythical status among some fans and I can imagine why, they had been on tour for two months and probably gotten a lot tighter.\n\nBizarrely, Rick and Francis sing “I saw my little lady walking down the Straße” even though it was not recorded in Germany! The “oh-oh-oh-oh” singalong in “Dirty Water” is in place. “Hold You Back” has the studio outro. Francis is pulling all kinds of rabbits out of his hat on “Forty-Five Hundred Times”, his improvised bits are constantly surprising and heavily extend the song without ever making it tedious (the switch to “Gotta Go Home” doesn’t occur until the 12 ½ minute mark!). I'm not sure I like Andy’s synths though… but his piano adds a new dimension to “Don't Waste My Time”.\n\nIn the break before the encores, you can hear the bootlegger explaining the details of the recording date! Very professional!"
