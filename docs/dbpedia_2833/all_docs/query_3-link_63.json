        "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAlmost every Beyoncé fan you speak to will tell you that every Beyoncé album has a distinct DNA and represents an era in time. Over the course of her two-decade solo career, the singer has experimented with different sounds and genres, all while fine-tuning her craft and expanding her legacy. As fans have come to observe, part of this process has included occasionally crossing over to other genres that haven’t traditionally defined her signature sound. Recently, the singer made headlines for yet another genre-defying upcoming project, and ahead of that release, we have compiled all her albums in order of their release and rank.\n\nBeyoncé's Discography\n\nWhile her Destiny’s Child days set the tone for her career, Queen Bey’s vast influence on R&B and pop music did not become as evident as it is now until she became a solo artist in 2003.\n\nFrom her early beginnings performing at the now-defunct 106 & Park to amassing a net worth of $800 million and being the most Grammy-awarded artist of all time, the Houston native has proven that her legacy is far-reaching. Although the singer has been known to keep a low profile and channel her impressions into the music, her journey hasn’t been without its controversies. More recently, her highly publicized decision to release an upcoming country album raised some brows. For critics, the singer’s decision to dabble in country music is uncharted territory for her, but ardent fans have argued that she is all too familiar with the genre and even released a track called “Daddy Lessons” on her critically acclaimed Lemonade.\n\nBeyoncé's Albums In Release Order\n\nFrom her debut album to her latest masterpiece, each Beyoncé album seems like a careful curation of her career trajectory and her impressions of it at the time. Forbes compiled a run-down of each of these Beyoncé albums by order of release date.\n\nBeyoncé (2013)\n\nLemonade (2016)\n\nRenaissance (2022)\n\nB'Day (2006)\n\nDangerously In Love (2003)\n\nI Am... Sasha Fierce (2008)\n\n4 (2011)\n\nThe Lion King: The Gift (2019)\n\nCowboy Carter (2024)\n\nBeyoncé's Albums Ranked\n\nAs it seems to go for many artists, there has been an ongoing debate about which Beyoncé era has produced her best work sonically.\n\nWhile there is no cut-and-dry answer to this debate, there seems to be a general consensus about how fans have ranked the singer’s albums over the years. Many of the rankings have been based on how well the album did commercially, as well as how the singer’s target audience responded to the music releases. Over the years, several Beyoncé albums on the compilation have served as a time capsule and helped to define the musical palettes of several eras. Music continues to evolve, and it is up to artists to create music that conforms to the times while maintaining their signature sound. Forbes compiled a run-down of each of these Beyoncé albums and the artistic direction that inspired each release.\n\n9. The Lion King: The Gift (2019)\n\nOn the heels of Afrobeats becoming a global musical force, Beyoncé released The Lion King: The Gift, a body of work that also doubled as a soundtrack for The Lion King remake. The album featured an array of notable African artists who appeared in various songs, including Wizkid, Burna Boy, Tiwa Savage and Shatta Wale, among others. In an interview with Good Morning America, Beyoncé said that she wanted the album to be a tribute to the African continent.\n\n“This soundtrack is a love letter to Africa, and I wanted to make sure we found the best talent from Africa and not just use some of the sounds and did my interpretation of it,\" Beyoncé said. \"We've kind of created our own genre, and I feel like the soundtrack, it becomes visual in your mind. It's a soundscape. It's more than just the music because each song tells the story of the film.”\n\n8. 4 (2011)\n\nIn 4, a 28-year-old Beyoncé took a more sultry approach. Many of the tracks on the album’s R&B tracklist were laden with love songs with varying tempos and underscored Beyoncé's ability to carry a song, regardless of its genre. The precision and artistry in empowerment anthems like “Run the World” coincided with the catchy tunes of “Love on Top” and the well-engineered “Start Over,” however, overall, the album leaned heavily into mid- to no-tempo tracks. Although 4 is arguably one of Bey’s more subdued albums, it still charted a path for her legacy. The album won the R&B Album of the Year at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.\n\n7. I Am … Sasha Fierce (2008)\n\nBeyoncé’s alter ego, Sasha Fierce, was born with the release of the album I Am … Sasha Fierce. Fans would later learn that the larger-than-life, unabashed, and ultra-energetic persona was a far cry from who Beyoncé is in real life. Her third studio album, in many ways, was her way of introducing Sasha to the world. In an interview with Oprah, Beyoncé opened up about how her alter ego influenced her music at the time.\n\n“Usually when I hear the chords when I put on my stilettos. Like the moment right before when you're nervous,\" she said. “Then Sasha Fierce appears, and my posture and the way I speak and everything is different.”\n\nThe music videos that accompanied this 2008 release were characterized by a laid-back, monochrome, and more subdued visual, compared to B’Day. Sonically, the album drew inspiration from pop, rock and electro-pop in a way that underscored Bey’s vocal ability and artistic flexibility. Some of the notable songs on this album include “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” and “Diva,” which are still considered classics. Upon its release, I Am…Sasha Fierce debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Although she was 27 when the album was released, her mastery of various musical styles, including ballads, soulful throwbacks, and up-tempo numbers formed the core of this album. Other fan-favorite songs from the album included “If I Were a Boy,” “Halo,” and “Sweet Dreams.”\n\n6. Dangerously In Love (2003)\n\nMost artists who venture out of groups to become independent entertainers face a lot of scrutiny and relabeling. Beyoncé’s Dangerously In Love propelled music listeners to pay closer attention to her body of work. Ultimately, the album served the quintessential goal of any inaugural solo release: to get the public’s respect and attention outside of a group setting. On songs like “Baby Boy,” the singer, who was only 21 years old at the time, showed incredible creative gusto by teaming up with Sean Paul for the dancehall-infused song which also had elements of reggae and house music, but she also reached back into her Destiny's Child roots with songs like “Dangerously In Love” and “Me, Myself and I,” which reminded fans of her vocal ability without being too predictable. Notable guest appearances on the body of work included features from top rapper Jay-Z, Big Boi and Missy Elliott. A year after its release, the album appropriately won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album. At the time, rumors that she had been romantically linked with Jay-Z began to surface, and that partly fueled the intrigue surrounding the album’s release.\n\n5. B’Day (2006)\n\nAfter Beyoncé officially became a solo act in 2003, not many people were sure about what to expect from the singer. For the first decade of her early career in Destiny’s Child, she had been known as the vocal powerhouse, but a solo career was unfamiliar to fans. Regardless, the “Ring the Alarm” singer did not disappoint, and to date, B’Day, her sophomore album, is regarded by many as the singer’s defining album because it has all of the elements of who Bey has come to represent sonically. The body of work, which was released on her 25th birthday, sold a little over 541,000 copies in its first week and won an award for the “Best Contemporary R&B Album” at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. Some of the genres that defined B’Day were R&B, pop and hip-hop. At the time, Beyoncé’’’ was rumored to be dating Jay-Z, so when he was featured on “Upgrade U” and “Déjà Vu,” pop culture as a whole was intrigued. In 2007, Beyoncé re-issued B'Day Anthology Video Album, along with the Deluxe Edition, which featured 13 music videos that saw Bey donning several outfits in her signature honey blonde updo, complete with sultry, high-tempo choreography and memorable costumes.\n\n4. Renaissance Act I (2022)\n\nIt is common for artists to evolve over the course of their careers and Beyoncé’s Renaissance is the perfect example of that. Apart from being the pinnacle that ushered in a bedazzling half-a-billion-dollar tour payday, the album also showcased Beyoncé at the height of her artistic evolution as an artist who refuses to settle into a singular mode for too long. The multi-genre nature of the album is evident throughout the playlist and is highlighted throughout the album’s tracklist. While Renaissance was well-received with records like “Break My Soul” defining the summer of 2022, commercially the album did not do as well as her other bodies of work with 190,000 units sold in its first week. Although the album is a comprehensive compilation of the singer’s ability to take risks, it also opened up a bitter-sweet conversation among the Beyhive when the Grammy Awards seemed to snub the album yet again for Album of the Year.\n\n3. Lemonade (2016)\n\nAt its core, Lemonade becomes a revelatory discourse that gave listeners a front-row seat to Beyoncé, the person, and not necessarily the global superstar. The album transcends mere musical expression and is a poignant display of some of her innermost vulnerabilities, which fans had never seen in that form before. What made the album stand out was the raw energy that Queen Bey seemed to pour into the record, including references to a certain “Becky With The Good Hair,” a catchphrase that referenced Jay-Z’s alleged mistress at the time and became the go-to phrase for “side chicks.” Even more poignant was the album’s references to race and Beyoncé’s Black womanhood, a reference that many of her fans were not quite prepared for. At its core, the album shifted beyond the boundaries of conventional music at the time and reflected the intricacies and nuances of modern relationships, race, lust and love. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry reported that Lemonade was the world’s best-selling album in 2016.\n\n2. Beyoncé (2013)\n\nA self-titled album is pretty ordinary for many artists who have reached the pinnacles of their careers, but Beyoncé's fifth studio album, Beyoncé, was anything but ordinary. In her documentary, Life Is But a Dream, Beyoncé made some comments about the music industry at the time, saying, “People don't make albums anymore. They just try to sell a bunch of little quick singles. And they burn out, and they put out a new one, and they burn out, and they put out a new one,” she said. Less than a year after she released the documentary, she would go on to release her fifth studio offering, a surprise album, Beyoncé, which would become a paradigm shift that re-defined digital streaming and music releases. The album, which was also dubbed “The Visual Album,” had a tapestry of 17 music videos to accompany each song, a move that is unheard of in the music industry. Unsurprisingly, the album was a raving commercial success and within only three days, sold over 617,000 copies in the United States and was labeled the fastest-selling album in the history of the iTunes Store at the time. Pop-culture critics believe that the release of this album and its critical acclaim solidified Beyoncé as a pop-culture icon. The body of work garnered her three Grammy awards for Best R&B Performance, Best R&B Song for “Drunk in Love,” and also a Grammy award for Best Surround Sound.\n\n1. Cowboy Carter (2024)\n\nWith Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé plunges fans into the heart of the Deep South in a way that only she can, evoking the region's raw essence with its rich blend of country and soulful elements. When Queen Bey said this was not a country album but a Beyoncé album, she meant it. Everything from the fusion of twangy guitars to the soul-stirring vocals and poignant storytelling gives listeners a heartfelt welcome into the South’s cultural tapestry. Miley Cyrus’s sonic contribution to the album “II Most Wanted” is reminiscent of aged whiskey and carries a smoky and mature quality that resonates with the rest of the album. The interpolation of Dolly Parton’s prelude to Bey’s version of “Jolene” might just be the most colorful reimagination of the classic song through a contemporary lens we have seen. In “Ameriican Requiem,” the Houston native sends a not-so-subtle reminder to harsh critics that she embodies the essence of country music, all while flexing her vocal muscles on hymn-like melodies that soar with emotional resonance. All in all, Beyoncé's masterful command of the genre challenges the status quo and is an audacious masterpiece that brings her three-decade career into a full-circle moment.\n\nIs Beyoncé Coming Out With Any New Albums?\n\nAfter the release of Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé does not have any albums expected in the immediate future. As for her current discography, whether ranked chronologically or based on commercial success, Beyoncé's albums offer a nuanced soundscape describing her artistic evolution. From chart-topping successes to moments of artistic experimentation, her discography is no monolith; instead, it is a sacred offering to the world of one of the things she clearly holds near and dear: her art."
