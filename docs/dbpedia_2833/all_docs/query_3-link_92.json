        "text": "Status Quo releases the first track ‘Paper Plane’ from their upcoming live album, ‘Official Archive Series Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’, through earMUSIC.\n\nThis song is the perfect soundtrack to forget the daily grind! At a Status Quo concert, ‘Paper Plane’ isn’t just a song, it’s a launchpad. The lights pulse, the crowd roars, and with the first riff, everyone takes flight. This version captures that raw energy, taken from the upcoming ‘Official Archive Series Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’, which is available now on all digital platforms along with a lyric video. Francis Rossi belts out the chorus, and a wave of pure joy washes over the venue. Strangers transform into a singing, swaying mass, united by the soaring spirit of the track. Live music magic!\n\nAccess ‘Paper Plane’ HERE.\n\nThe ‘Official Archive Series’ offers exceptional sound quality and great packaging throughout, featuring photography by Christie Goodwin. The Series has been freshly mixed and mastered by Eike Freese and Laurin Halberstadt at Chameleon Studios Hamburg.\n\n‘Vol. 3 – Live At Westonbirt Arboretum’ was recorded on Sunday 22 June 2008 as part of the ‘In Search Of The Fourth Chord’ UK tour. This was the tenth show of the year, and was part of the ‘Forest Live’ initiative by the Forestry Commission, and in fact was a return to the venue for the band who had performed a short run of ‘Forest Live’ shows as part of the ‘Heavy Traffic’ tour of 2003.\n\nPre-order the album HERE."
