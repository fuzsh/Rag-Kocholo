Alija Izetbegović likewise resigned from the Presidency.  In February 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Council of Ministers’ structure was illegal; a new system is being negotiated.  Federation president and VP in 1999: Ejup Ganić and Ivo Andrić-Luţanski.  Past RS presidents: Radovan Karadţić, Nikola Poplašen, Mirko Šarović, Dragan Ĉavić, and Milan Jelić.  On 5 March 1999, RS president Nikola Poplašen was discharged by the OHR.\n\n12.  The Parliamentary Assembly (Parliamentarna skupština) is Bosnia and Herzegovina’s chief legislative body and it contains two chambers:  The House of Peoples (Dom naroda)  The National House of Representatives (Predstavnički dom/Zastupnički dom)  The Parliamentary Assembly’s tasks are:  passing legislation as needed to apply decisions of the Presidency or to perform the duties of the Assembly under the Constitution.  deciding upon the sources and quantities of incomes for the operations of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and global commitments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  approving the budget for the institutes of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  deciding ratify treaties and agreements.  other issues as are required to conduct its responsibilities of as are assigned to it by mutual agreement of the Entities.  Until 2001, Bosnia and Herzegovina lacked a lasting election law; when a lasting election law was put in place, a draft law identifying four-year terms for the state and first-order administrative division entity legislatures.  On 9 September 2001, the final election law was passed and made public.\n\n13.  The House of Peoples is grouped of 15 representatives who serve for two years.  Two-thirds of those representatives come from the Federation (5 Croats and 5 Bosniaks); one-third comes from the RS (5 Serbs).  Nine affiliates of the House of Peoples make up a quorum, providing that a minimum of three representatives from every group are present.  Federation delegates are chosen by the House of Peoples of the Federation, a 58-seat house (17 Bosniak, 17 Croat, 17 Serb, and 7 others) whose affiliates are represented by cantonal assemblies to serve for 4 years.  The 28-affiliate Republika Srpska Council of Peoples, established in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, pick RS delegates; every component nation has eight representatives and “others” have four representatives.\n\n14.  The House of Representatives is grouped of 42 affiliates; two-thirds of these affiliates are elected from the Federation to serve four-year terms (14 Croats and 14 Bosniaks), while one-third of these affiliates are elected from the RS (14 Serbs).  Federation affiliates come from the Federation House of Representatives, with 98 seats, whose affiliates are elected through popular vote to serve four-year terms.  RS affiliates come from the RS National Assembly, an 83-seat assembly whose affiliates are elected through popular vote to serve 4-year terms.\n\n15.  Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Socijaldemokratska partija Bosne i Hercegovine, SDP BiH)  Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (Савез независних социјалдемократа , СНСД) Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata, SNSD)  Party of Democratic Action (Stranka demokratske akcije, SDA)  Serbian Democratic Party (Српска демократска странка, СДС;
