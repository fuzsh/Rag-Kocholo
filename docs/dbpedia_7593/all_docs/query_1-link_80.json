        "text": "Russiaâs political influence in Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nAlthough the Western Balkans are not of central importance to Russian foreign policy, Russia has forged political links with Serbia, Montenegro and BiH that provide it with varying degrees of leverage. Apart from government-to-government relations, Russia has committed to building relations with political proxies, thereby employing consistent political narratives revolving around traditional values and pan-Slavism. The Kremlinâs position on Kosovo in particular has yielded influence among ethnic Serb politicians and societies in the three countries. Lastly, links with the Orthodox Church amplify pro-Russian political narratives in the region.\n\nPolitical relations\n\nIn terms of political integration, BiH, Serbia and Montenegro have, as a result of their years-long EU accession processes, a far more institutionalised relationship with the EU than with Russia. Russian-led multilateral efforts like the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) do not stretch to the Western Balkans, with two partial exceptions: Serbiaâs observer status in the CSTO and its free-trade agreement with the EEU. While simultaneously being connected to these initiatives and negotiating accession to the EU, Serbia is also keen to nurture relations with other regions, as exemplified by its hosting of the Non-Aligned Movement summit in 2021.\n\nIn the absence of strong multilateral frameworks, relations between the three south-eastern European states and Russia are predominantly forged through bilateral cooperation. There are strong differences between the countries, as is clear from the number of bilateral meetings, as shown in Figure 3. Russian-Serbian relations are marked by declarations of like-mindedness, historical partnership, and brotherhood. Serbia and Russia have signed cooperation agreements on numerous issues, ranging from trade, defence, foreign policy and energy to visa-free travel. Montenegro, on the other hand, is on Russiaâs list of so-called non-friendly states, and, especially after it joined NATO, largely regarded by Moscow as an adversary rather than ally. BiHâs state-level relations with Russia are limited. Instead, engagement is mostly through the Republika Srpska (RS) entity. RS-Russia relations are perhaps even more explicit than Serbian-Russian relations, mainly because the RS political leadership, impersonated by the entityâs long-term ruler, Milorad Dodik, expresses strong âdemandâ for such Russian influence. In the past five years, Dodik has visited Moscow more times than any other European politician. He decorated Putin with the highest RS medal of honour in January 2023 and was decorated by Putin with the Order of Alexander Newysk in June 2023.\n\nDifferences between Montenegro, BiH and Serbia are also apparent in their responses and actions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Whereas the three countries all voted to condemn Russian aggression on Ukraine in a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) vote early March 2022, follow-up actions have differed. Montenegro has fully aligned with EU sanctions on Russia since 2014, whereas Serbia has hinted at but so far refused to impose any sanctions. Also, BiH has failed to impose sanctions, mainly because of resistance from RS leader Milorad Dodik, who on the contrary sought to intensify economic relations with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFigure 3\n\nState visits and important political contact moments, 2020â2023\n\nInfluence through political proxies\n\nImportantly, Russian political influence in Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is not all-encompassing, but, particularly in Montenegro and BiH, is wielded through political proxies representing only part of the political spectrum. Even among these proxies, different levels of Russia-mindedness can be observed, with most of them being primarily self-interested and some actively searching to balance relations with other external powers also. Russia has, however, become reliant on certain proxies to such an extent that it continuously supports them in spite of their dominantly self-interested agendas, which often, but not always, overlap with Russian objectives.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia relies strongly on RS president and leader of the Bosnian-Serb party SNSD (Alliance of Independent Social Democrats) Milorad Dodik, who has presented himself for years as the Balkan leader most loyal to Moscow. Russia has in the past directly financed Dodikâs elections campaigns and, according to an expert, the country is the prime investor in RS, although that does not appear in official statistics. Apart from Dodik, other politicians in RS, for example Nenad StevandiÄ from the United Srpska (US) party, can also be regarded as pro-Russian.\n\nRussiaâs support for RS politicians is clear for several reasons, for example from the behaviour of its ambassador Igor Kalbukhov, who attended the 9 January RS parade in Banja Luka in spite of a ban by BiHâs highest court. Kalbukhov also threatened that Russia would be forced to take action if BiH takes steps towards NATO integration. At the same time, also in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, political forces like the Bosnian-Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of Dragan ÄoviÄ sometimes act in the Russian interest, for example when ÄoviÄ and his fellow HDZ senators voted against aligning with EU sanctions towards Russia in BiHâs House of Peoples. Moreover, on 23 June 2023 the US Embassy in BiH condemned ÄoviÄ for obstructing the Southern Interconnection natural gas pipeline, which would reduce BiH dependence on Russian gas, declaring that âBiH is at energy crossroads, and HDZ BiH is blocking the path to European integration and energy security.â In Montenegro, Russia became more influential in 2020 when pro-Russian and pro-Serbian parties ousted the long-term parliamentary dominance of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), headed by long-term president Milo ÄukanoviÄ. In particular, the Za buduÄnost Crne Gore (For the Future of Montenegro) movement of Andrija Mandic and Milan KneÅ¾eviÄ, formerly known as the Democratic Front Alliance, garnered about 15% of the votes in the 2023 parliamentary elections and can be regarded as pro-Russian. There is proof of direct funding from the Kremlin for the parties making up the alliance. Their politicians campaigned against Montenegroâs NATO integration, visited Moscow for meetings with Russian politicians in 2016, and signed the so-called LovÄen Declaration on cooperation between KneÅ¾eviÄâ Democratic People's Party and the United Russia party. They were also convicted in a first-instance verdict for their alleged participation in the 2016 coup attempt, although a retrial will be held after a higher court overturned that decision due to procedural mistakes.\n\nOn the other hand, the Europe Now! Movement of the April 2023 elected president Jakov MilatoviÄ, who ousted long-term DPS leader Milo ÄukanoviÄ from power, is nominally firmly focused on EU integration and domestic reforms. Europe Now!, which won the most seats in the June 2023 parliamentary elections, has, however, also taken a more pro-Serb position in the Orthodox Church rifts that split Montenegro in the past few years, and different factions within the party have different geopolitical outlooks. As numerous unknowns remain regarding Europe Nowâs orientation, time will be needed to realistically assess their actual goals and policies.\n\nIn Serbia, a larger proportion of the political scene has forged strong ties with Russia. Russiaâs position as a UN Security Council member that supports Serbiaâs position on Kosovo is the main source of Russian influence over Serbiaâs political landscape. It largely explains why the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) government of President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ has openly pursued a Russia-friendly foreign policy, including after Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The previous Minister of Internal Affairs and current head of Serbiaâs Security Intelligence Agency, Aleksander Vulin, is perhaps the most outspoken and influential pro-Russian political actor in the country. He travelled to meet Lavrov in Moscow in August 2022 and is suspected of delivering wiretaps of a Russian opposition meeting in Belgrade to Russiaâs Security Council Secretary Patrushev. Coalition partner SPS (Socialist Party of Serbia), led by Ivica DaÄiÄ, is generally regarded as pro-Russian as well.\n\nA more extreme far-right proxy exists in the form of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Å eÅ¡elj, a far-right war criminal convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and once regarded as the political mentor of current president VuÄiÄ. Although his party is currently not represented in Parliament, far right parties have not disappeared from Serbiaâs political scene. The ultra-nationalist party Srpska stranka Zavetnici, or Serbian Party Oathkeepers (SSZ), led by Milica ÄurÄeviÄ Stamenkovski, retains an openly pro-Russian and anti-NATO course. Other factions, such as the National Democratic Alternative (NADA) and Dveri-POKS, also pursue nationalistic conservative agendas, for example advocating for the reintegration of Kosovo.\n\nRussian support for far-right Serb political forces has a destabilising effect not only in Serbia but also in its neighbouring countries. That is because these politicians (as well as nationalistic proxy groups) generally hold positive views on the creation of a Greater Serbia as propagated in the 1990s by former Serb president MiloÅ¡eviÄ, or Srpski Svet (Serbian world), a term forged in 2014 and similar to the irredentist ideology of the Russkiy Mir (Russian world). By supporting these actors, Russia undermines the stability and the sovereignty of neighbouring countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro. Such ideologies also constitute an important aspect of Serbiaâs non-recognition of Kosovo, which hosts a considerable Serbian community as well as many sites of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\nRussian political narratives\n\nRussia employs various narratives in its approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia that resonate well with substantial sections of their populations. The central notions of these narratives revolve around the ideas of: a) Russia as the defender of Christian-Orthodox traditional values; b) a pan-Slavic link between the peoples of Russia and the Western Balkans; c) the degeneration of the collective West; d) a need for strong leaders ready to defend their country and values in todayâs world; e) NATO expansion as a cause for the war in Ukraine; and f) territorial integrity as an argument for support of Serbiaâs position on Kosovo.\n\nSuch narratives resonate well in some sections of society in all three countries, given their conservative nature and lack of longstanding democratic tradition, as well as a sense of disappointment with EU integration after what many consider as 20 years in the EU âwaiting roomâ. However, importantly, support for the EU and Russia are not necessarily communicating vessels, meaning that those who are pro-EU are not necessarily anti-Russian, and vice-versa.. Besides, while many people in the three countries support narratives on conservative values, at the same time they mock Russiaâs performance on the battlefield in Ukraine. It would be too much of a simplification to classify people as simply pro-Russian or pro-EU, as such classifications fail to account for local interests and orientations.\n\nPolitical influence through the Orthodox Church\n\nA particularly visible actor in spreading Russian narratives is the Serbian Orthodox Church, estimated to have about 8 million members of which most in the three countries examined, thereby having substantial societal influence. De jure, the Serbian Orthodox Church is autocephalous and as such not subordinated to the Patriarchate in Moscow. De facto, the Serbian Orthodox Church retains close ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, which is closely connected with the Kremlin and has presented itself as a solid supporter of Russiaâs foreign policies, including its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian influence through the Orthodox Church works in several ways. First, the Serbian Orthodox Church replicates a large part of the Russian narratives presented above, thereby not only spreading conservative values but also political viewpoints of partnership between Russia and the three countries. It âprovides religious legitimacy to domestic and foreign state policiesâ in Serbia, but also promotes Serb nationalism and anti-Western agendas in Montenegro and BiH, for example when it campaigned strongly against Montenegroâs 2017 NATO accession.\n\nSecond, Russia actively amplifies church rifts in the region to sow division and destabilise societies at large. For example, in Montenegro, a separate Montenegrin Orthodox Church exists, but it is not recognised by the Patriarch of Constantinople or the Russian Orthodox Church, and about 90% of Montenegrin Orthodox believers have remained with the Serbian church instead. After Montenegro passed a controversial freedom of religion law in 2019 that would see properties of religious organisations transferred to the Montenegrin state upon certain conditions, the Russian Orthodox Church was quick to take a political position in the debate, while prominent Serbian clergy organised and led street protests.\n\nThird, the Serbian Orthodox Church supports nationalist and far-right groups and individuals who often advocate for closer ties with Russia. For example, it has twice decorated abovementioned Vojislav Å eÅ¡elj, and endorsed the viewpoints of groups such as Narodne Patrole. The Church has given tacit support to Milorad Dodikâs secessionist agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Patriarch Porfirije himself taking part prominently in the banned 9 January Republika Srpska victory parade in 2022. In effect, the Orthodox Church is both a channel for Russian narratives, a tool employed by Russia to sow divisions, and a political actor in itself that supports pro-Russian politicians and Serb nationalism in the three countries.\n\nIn conclusion, Russiaâs political clout stretches especially to (pro-)Serb politicians, who often make use of similar narratives and use Russia as an external supporter to promote their own ideas. Political relations between Russia and the three countries, unlike those with the EU, remain, however, fragmented and under-institutionalised. While this may be a deliberate strategy, it is determined by the entry points the context offers, which are more limited than in the case of Russiaâs more direct neighbours. Of the three countries, entry points for Russian influence are most widespread In Serbia, followed by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russia has, however, continued to unconditionally support nominally pro-Russian politicians in all three countries, including by directly financing their parties. Especially regarding its position on Kosovo, support for RS leader Milorad Dodik and Orthodox Church links remain important entry points for Russian political influence in the region at large.\n\nRussian influence through security and military cooperation: a story coming to an end?\n\nSince Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, Moscowâs security involvement in the Western Balkans has toned down but not become insignificant. Due to the regionâs history and geographical location â being bordered by EU and NATO member states â and in contrast with the Eastern Partnership countries, Russia has no military presence in the Western Balkans. As such, it must resort to other, hybrid, methods to stir up unresolved conflicts and instability. Nevertheless, Russia still manages to maintain some military and security links with its main allies, Serbia and the Republika Srpska (RS). It does so through military pacts, joint exercises, military training and arms supplies. However, with NATO member Montenegro, such cooperation is wholly absent. Montenegroâs (as well as Albaniaâs and North Macedoniaâs) NATO accession highlights the fact that Russia has in the past few years largely failed to prevent the overall integration of the region with Euro-Atlantic institutions in spite of its obstructive agenda.\n\nFigure 6\n\nMap of EU and/or NATO members in south-east Europe\n\nSince Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, Serbia has continued to hold observer status within the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), even if in practice contacts have been limited. Serbia has officially proclaimed military neutrality since 2007, but has participated in several âSlavic Brotherhoodâ joint military exercises and a military initiative involving the Serbian, Russian and Belarusian armed forces. Belgrade displayed some sensitivity to EU pressure when it froze its participation in the 2020 exercises without notifying Minsk beforehand, although it re-joined the exercises from 2021 until the Russian invasion of Ukraine one year later. Factually, even if politically sensitive in the country, NATO is a much more important partner to Belgrade. As a NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) country, Serbia has undertaken significantly more military exercises with NATO than with Russia. Serbiaâs first joint military exercise since Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is the âPlatinum Wolfâ exercise with NATO. At the same time, Serbiaâs Director of the Security Information Agency, Aleksandar Vulin, attended an international security conference in Moscow in May 2023. It is unclear whether the country would be willing to face further pressure from the currently geopolitically awakened EU if any further joint exercises were to be initiated by Russia.\n\nThe Russian-Serbian security relation includes arms supplies. Moscow provided Belgrade with air defence systems, anti-tank weapons, drones and other military hardware between 2018 and 2021. These deliveries were part of a military technical assistance agreement signed by both parties in 2016 to support Belgrade in modernising its military. Even as Russia has been Serbiaâs most consistent supplier of military equipment since that year, Russia is not the only game in town. According to the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, in 2022 China exported more arms to Serbia (320TIV) than Russia did between 2016 and 2022 (306TIV). When it comes to arms deliveries, it is furthermore relevant to mention that Serbia itself has, according to leaked US intelligence documents, and in spite of its professed neutrality, exported arms to Ukraine in the past year. This was vehemently denied by Serbia itself at first, although Serbian president VuÄiÄ later admitted that Serbian ammunition was possibly sold to Ukraine through intermediaries and that he is not opposed to that.\n\nRussia also cooperates with the Republika Srpska entity in the security domain, specifically regarding counterintelligence, counterterrorism and police training. Western actors are concerned with the militarisation of the RS police as well as the potential construction of another Russian operational (officially âhumanitarianâ) centre, similar to its facility in NiÅ¡ (Serbia). Sarajevo also claims that RS is trying to procure Russian anti-aircraft missiles. Such arms deliveries could contribute to future tensions and are concerning, as the RS entity also acquired 2,500 automatic rifles from Serbia. RS cooperation with Russia goes against Bosniaâs cooperation with NATO, which has, in spite of resistance and delaying tactics from RS, gradually increased in the past years. The country has had a PfP agreement with NATO since 2006, was offered a Membership Action Plan in 2010, and as part of that effort submitted a so-called Reform Programme in 2019.\n\nTo summarise, Russia seeks to maintain its military cooperation with its main partner, Serbia, while also supporting the militarisation of Republika Srpska. Belgrade is satisfied with its current degree of cooperation with Moscow but seeks to avoid becoming Russiaâs foothold in the Balkans. In reality, Russia is only one of multiple security actors in the Balkans, overshadowed by NATO and challenged by China.\n\nRussian malign influences: proxy groups, cyber attacks and meddling in internal affairs\n\nWhile presenting itself as a partner to Serbia and the RS in particular, Russia also resorts to malign actions to influence developments in Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It supports non-state paramilitary, criminal and cyber groups in the region, and interferes in political affairs to the scale of supporting political coups. Russia furthermore facilitates direct cyber-attacks from Russia, and Russian private military companies like Wagner recruit citizens to fight for private military cooperations in Ukraine.\n\nRussia employs existing non-state organisations, organised crime groups and hacker societies in the Western Balkans to destabilise the region and further its influence. Moscow does not directly coordinate actions led by such actors, but instead supports their activities in an informal manner and through a multitude of actors such as oligarchs, representatives of the Orthodox Church, or political proxies. At the same time, local malign groups sometimes operate in line with Russian interests while lacking direct engagement with Russia. As such, Moscow is not always engaged, but if so, it is in an indirect manner, making involvement difficult to prove.\n\nProxy groups\n\nThe infamous âNight Wolvesâ biker group is one of Moscowâs proactive proxy groups, with local chapters in Serbia, Montenegro and BiH. In 2018, Russia allegedly provided the group with a $41,000 grant to tour the Western Balkans and demonstrate in support of Milorad Dodik and his ambition of the âpeacefully disintegrationâ of BiH. âSerbian Honourâ, another proxy, is a far-right group with links to organised crime active in Serbia and RS and was allegedly established in the âRussian-Serb Humanitarian Centreâ in NiÅ¡. In 2018, its BiH faction was reported to act as Dodikâs personal security force, but more recently, the group has diminished in importance, seemingly because of earlier overexposure.\n\nFor both Serbian Honour and the Night Wolves, it would go too far to label the organisations as âparamilitaryâ, given their lack of a military-like structure. The only proxy group that to a certain extent resembles a military organisation is the 2016 founded âUnion of Cossacks of the Balkansâ. Viktor Zaplatin, one of the prominent Unionâs leaders, served in the Soviet army. The Unionâs main mission is to promote pro-Russian, conservative and Orthodox narratives and push back on the âimpositionâ of western values.\n\nAnother, recently visible, proxy group is the Serbian group Narodne Patrole, or national patrol, led by Damnjan KneÅ¾eviÄ, one of the founders of the far-right political party Serbian Oathkeepers. KneÅ¾eviÄ travelled to the then newly opened Wagner Centre in St Petersburg in November 2022. He was arrested in February 2023 over violent protests in Belgrade against Serbiaâs normalisation process with Kosovo but released soon after. The group can be described as ultra-nationalist, anti-migration, and openly pro-Russian and pro-Wagner. It remains unclear to what extent they actively facilitate Wagner activities in Serbia.\n\nIn addition to the proxy groups, Russian oligarchs have also set foot in the region. A prime example is Konstantin Malofeev, an oligarch and founder of the Charitable Foundation of St Basil the Great, an organisation that seeks to spread the Russian Orthodox faith, a key asset for reaching out to conservative groups in the Balkans. Malofeev was implicated in the early organisational stages of the 2016 Montenegro coup. Interestingly, Malofeevâs spiritual adviser is the Orthodox priest Bishop Tikhon, who is also Putinâs spiritual adviser. Although not all of these actors are directly coordinated by the Kremlin, many proxy groups, Orthodox brotherhoods, Russian oligarchs and Orthodox figures form a loosely connected network across the Balkans. According to an interviewee, they are organised locally in order to maintain a low profile, but when deemed necessary by Russia, they are quickly united, such as happened in the pro-Russia protest in Belgrade in March 2022.\n\nWhile explicit public evidence is lacking, support and training of malign groups is believed to take place through the âHumanitarianâ Centre in NiÅ¡, Serbia. Formally intended for disaster relief, the centre is believed by the West to be an intelligence centre and is suspected of hosting military training for paramilitary units. Vucicâs government has so far refused to grant diplomatic status to the centreâs Russian staff. Rumours surfaced in 2018 about the construction of a similar centre in RS near Banja Luka but are denied by the Russian Embassy in Sarajevo and after 2018 no further reports have been published.\n\nPolitical and digital interference\n\nAnother form of Russian malign actions is meddling in political affairs. The most prominent example is the 2016 political coup attempt in Montenegro as the country was about to join NATO. The coup failed as a result of poor organisation, mainly because Russia relied on a loose web of proxies, including radical Serb nationalists and Night Wolves, but also the earlier-mentioned Democratic Front politicians. Several backed out just days before. Although concerning, the episode shows that Russia is not the strategic mastermind it is sometimes believed to be. In the wake of the failed coup, 13 people, including two Russian intelligence (GRU) officers (in absentia), Eduard Shirokov and Vladimir Popov, were convicted, although a retrial is currently underway. So far, no other coup attempts at such scale have been discovered, although Russian-Serbian relations did take a limited hit over a Russian espionage operation revealed in 2019, in which a retired military officer was seen taking large sums of cash from a Russian diplomat.\n\nRussia also uses cyber-attacks to destabilise the Balkans. Montenegro is the most targeted country in south-east Europe. On the same day of the coup attempt, the Montenegrin authorities were struck by cyber-attacks. Attacks were attributed to the APT28 group, also known as Fancy Bear, which is claimed by the US to be tied to the Russian intelligence organisation, GRU. It is of some concern that Montenegro has the second-lowest regional score on the Global Cybersecurity Index, while Bosnia and Herzegovina scores lowest. In August 2022, Montenegroâs government websites and critical infrastructure systems were targeted by largescale cyber-attacks. Despite Cuba ransomware â a Russian-speaking gang â claiming responsibility for part of the attack, the Montenegrin National Security Agency blamed the attack on Russia, stating that some organisations are a disguise to hide Russian government involvement.\n\nPrivate military corporations\n\nLastly, amidst the war in Ukraine, signals regarding the recruitment of Serb and Bosnian nationals to join Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine have also come to the fore. It is estimated that a few dozen Serb nationals are currently fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, meaning numbers are not substantial. Recruitment to the Wagner group has been facilitated by veterans organisations, such as those from the RS capital, Banja Luka (affiliated to Serbian Honour), which retain close links with Russian counterparts. Serbian Cossack groups are also believed to be a tool of Russian influence in the region, and are also potential sources of recruits. The most visible recruitment effort was perhaps in early 2023, when Russia Todayâs Balkans service published a Wagner advertorial to join the private military company in Ukraine. Wagner murals also appeared in Serbia and North Kosovo. The Serbian central government firmly condemned Wagnerâs mercenary activities in the country.\n\nTo conclude, Russia resorts to malign instruments which have often proven to be effective in shaping the political environment of the Western Balkans. Lacking a military presence in the region, Russia supports far-right nationalist figures and organisations, which generally better resemble organised crime groups than paramilitary organisations, to attain its goal of destabilisation by stirring up polarisation and anti-Western sentiment. Although such malign influence has not succeeded in distancing the Balkan countries from their rapprochement with the West, Russia has allowed malign actors to become more active in the region to the point of destabilising entire governments."
