The Federation of BiH got a new government after eight years

Summary

In 2015, Prime Minister Fadil Novalić came to head the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Eight years and two election cycles later, there is a new FBiH Government. The Party of Democratic Action (SDA) went into opposition, which was apparently helped, in addition to the united previous opposition parties, by the “international factor”, which for some reason was keenly interested – and did not hide it – in making this change happen.

Introduction

The last Friday in April was dramatic for the political scene of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH). The culmination of several months of political struggle for the majority in the House of Representatives (HoR) of the Parliament of the Federation of BiH (PFBiH) took place. The new FBiH Government was elected by a narrow majority, and with changes to the Election Law of BiH imposed by the High Representative of the international community for BiH. Imposed changes that actually made it possible to form a government without the Party of Democratic Action (Stranka demokratske akcije – SDA), which for decades was an unavoidable rulling factor in the FBiH entity and the state, caused numerous and serious accusations as well as protests by the dissatisfied in front of the Parliament building.

Background of the clash

The last time the Parliament of the FBiH entity voted for a single government before 28th April was in March 2015, when Fadil Novalić, a member of the SDA, was the chosen to be first government representative then chosen Prime Minister. After the 2018 elections, due to the political blockade that arose between the old partners, the Bosniak SDA and the Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ), who both had blocking mechanisms through the institution of the president or vice-president of the FBiH, a new government was not even elected, and Novalić’s cabinet remained in a so-called technical mandate. Such a scenario threatened this time as well. Although the SDA won the largest number of votes in the elections held in October 2022, rarely did any party want to enter into a coalition with it at any of the many levels in BiH: from the state, through the entity, to the cantonal ones. The state government was already formed without the SDA, but the entity level is much more powerful, with numerous powerful positions in the ministries and public companies in fields of agriculture, energy, telecommunications, and infrastructure. That’s why the fight to form a majority lasted from the time the results were announced in November last year, until the end of April. In the complicated process that includes the selection of delegates to the House of Peoples (HoP) of the FBiH Parliament from ten cantonal assemblies, who then elect the president and two vice-presidents of the FBiH, who then propose a representative for the composition of the FBiH Government, which is elected by the HoR of the PFBiH, the parties used various methods to staying or winning power. At one point, it seemed that Novalić’s cabinet, in which several ministers had been missing for a long time, due to blockages in the government formation process, would remain until further notice[1].

International factor

In order for this not to happen, the international factor intervened, specifically the Office of the High Representative (OHR) supported by several Western embassies, which were constantly blowing the backs and publicly encouraging the new majority led by the SDA-opposed “Troika” and HDZ parties. This was so obvious that at one time the SDA and some other public officials openly began to accuse High Representative Schmidt and the United States Embassy of bias and – Islamophobia[2].

Ahead of the session of the HoR of the PFBiH on Friday April 28th and the election of a new government, things moved quickly. First, during the week, two parties of the center-right – the People’s European Party (Narodna evropska stranka – NES) and the Party for BiH (Stranka za BiH – SBiH), which were part of the majority, announced that they would not support the new government led by the “Troika” and the HDZ, even though they were supposed to be in that government get very important departments such as the Ministries of Agriculture and Energy[3]. On Thursday, the day before the session, High Representative Schmidt imposed changes to the Election Law of BiH, according to which the election of the new government does not require the signatures of the president of the FBiH and both of vice-presidents, but only two out of three signatures are sufficient[4]. With that, the Bosniak vice-president, SDA cadre Refik Lendo, who had been announcing all along that he would not support a government in which there is no SDA, lost political weight[5]. FBiH President Lidija Bradara (Croat from HDZ) and Vice President Igor Stojanović (Serb, Social Democratic Party of BiH – SDP) sent the proposed composition of the FBiH Government to the PFBiH HoR for adoption[6].

Friday drama

Before the session on Friday, it was not clear whether the “Troika” and HDZ BiH still have the majority to form the government. At the adoption of the Agenda, it turned out that he had it: narrow, but still a majority. After the half-day session and after the representatives of the SDA and some other parties left the session, it turned out that 51 out of total of 98 representatives voted for the new government, which will be led by the president of the SDP BiH, Nermin Nikšić[7].

Who voted for new government? Representatives of the “Troika”, which consist three parties based in Sarajevo: the center-left SDP party, Our Party (Naša stranka – NS), which represents the positions of the liberal center, and People and Justice (Narod i Pravda – NiP), the center-right conservative party; then the largest party of Croatian sign – HDZ BiH, but also representatives of smaller Croatian parties who agreed to support the new government in the photo finish and in return got the position of Minister of Health[8]. The majority was brought by a representative of the NES who voted against his party and in return received the position of Minister of the Interior[9].

The session of PFBiH brought several hundred citizens who came to protest against “the betrayal of Bosniak interests” and the imposition of changes to the BiH Election Law made by Schmidt[10]. Among the gathered citizens was Mrs. Sebija Izetbegović, director of the Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo and wife of SDA leader Bakir Izetbegović, and the media announced that all KCUS workers were informed in writing that, if they wanted to protest, they would be given the day off[11]. Be that as it may, several MPs who were targeted as traitors endured verbal and mild physical attacks, but the government was still elected[12]. On the eve of the session itself, the leaders of the “Troika”, Nikšić (SDP), Edin Forto (NS) and Elmedin Konaković (NiP), accused the SDA of buying delegates in the period since the election, and even before the session, they offered huge sums of money to individual representatives not to support new government![13]

The FBiH entity finally got a new government, which had been waiting since 2018. And that the new government has the support of Western embassies was clear after the prompt congratulations that came from the US Embassy in Sarajevo, which said on Twitter that it is time for the ruling coalition to start implementing vital reforms necessary for the growth of the economy in the Federation of BiH, strengthening the rule of law, the fight against corruption and the improvement of social services[14].

During the session, the exposition of the new government was read by Nikšić, who said that the new government will focus on economic reforms. Inflation, emigration of migrants are some of the key challenges that the new government will face. He said that FBiH must be the engine of economic development as a whole because it has all the prerequisites and that[15].

New ministries

The FBiH government has 16 ministries and a prime minister. In addition to the prime ministership, the SDP received five more portfolios, HDZ BiH five also, NiP and NS two each, HDZ 1990 one, and one was given to a representative of the NES, who will certainly be kicked out of this party due to voting for the new government[16].

When it comes to personnel solutions, let’s start with the last one mentioned, the one which was given to ex-NES representative who supported the FBiH Government. Mr Ramo Isak is a new ministry of interior affairs. His name is the most controversial in new government since he was convicted twice in the past for violent behavior[17].

HDZ 1990 got the position of minister in the Ministry of Health, which will be managed by Nediljko Rimac. NS received two portfolios, namely tourism and the environment, which will be headed by party vice-president and professor of urban planning Nasiha Pozder; and trade, which will be managed by Amir Hasičević, doctor of economic sciences. NiP also received two portfolios. Kemal Hrnjić, the former general manager of the company Meggle, one of the most important brands of dairy products and processed products in BiH, will be the minister of agriculture, water management and forestry, while Adnan Delić, the former minister of economy in Canton Sarajevo, will be the federal minister of labor and social policy.

HDZ BiH has five departments. The most important is that of finance, which will be led by Toni Kraljević, who was the minister of the same department in the government of the West Herzegovina Canton. Vedran Škobić, a lawyer from Mostar, is the new FBiH minister of justice, and Željko Nedić, an economist from Orašje, heads the Ministry of Spatial Planning. Andrijana Katić, a former advisor to HDZ president Dragan Čović for many decades, will lead the important Ministry of transport and communications, and Sanja Vlaisavljević, Sarajevo professor of philosophy and sociology and director of the Center for Culture of Dialogue, will be the minister of culture and sports.

SDP also has five portfolios. The Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mining will be headed by the former minister of finance in the Government of Tuzla Canton, Vedran Lakić; the Ministry of Displaced Persons and Refugees will be headed by Nerin Dizdar, political director of SDP; the Ministry of Development, Entrepreneurship and Crafts will be headed by Vojin Mijatović, a former adviser to the President of the Republic of Srpska; professor of international relations Jasna Duraković will head the Ministry of Education and Science, and the Ministry of Veteran Affairs will be headed by Nedžad Lokmić, professor of German Studies. He managed this department in the Government of Zenica-Doboj Canton[18].

Conclusion

The new government begins its mandate at a complex moment on the internal and external level. But the support of the Western factor is more than obvious, so it can be assumed that these countries, first of all the USA, will do everything to ensure that this political project survives and thrives. The entity level has much more authority than the state level and therefore can influence the lives of citizens much more. Expectations are also very mixed. However, it is important to note that this is the first FBiH Government since 2001 in which the SDA does not participate. This “fundamental” Bosniak party has so far largely controlled numerous streams of life in this entity, including the cumbersome public sector and employment and public procurement in it. They have had a hard time coming to terms with the loss of power, and they will certainly be looking for any opportunity in the coming period to challenge the authority of the new government and raise protests from some of the social groups it has influence over. On the other hand, the new government must show and prove: show that the previous one was corrupt and prove that they are better than such previous government.

[5] By the way, the way in which the SDA got the position of vice-president of the Federation is also bizarre: the president and vice-presidents propose the HoP of the PFBiH from a joint list, and it is adopted by the HoR. Each of the three national clubs in the HoP delegates its proposal, with the proposal can come from a minimum of 13 delegates out of 23. During the process of electing delegates to the Bosniak club, the SDA managed to increase the number of delegates from 11 to 13 through post-election engineering, thereby blackmailing the further establishment of the government:
