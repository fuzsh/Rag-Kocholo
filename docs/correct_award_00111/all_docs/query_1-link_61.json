        "text": "With flowers in front of the monument and a walk around the places described in his autobiographical books, the 117th anniversary of the birth of the Nobel laureate Elias Canetti, born in Ruse, was celebrated.\n\n\"People make a city. I am proud that such a great person as Elias Canetti was born in Ruse,\" said Deputy Mayor Zlatomyra Stefanova. She thanked the members of the International Society \"Elias Canetti\" for keeping the spirit of the Nobel laureate for years and confirming it as one of the emblems of Ruse.\n\nA festive program was prepared in memory of the humanist. A tour led by the president of the society Prof. Penka Angelova and Dr. Veselin Antonova started from the Canetti monument in Ruse at 10:00. It was dedicated to the places in Rousse that left a lasting impression on his consciousness and creativity, as well as to the people he remembers - relatives Arditi, Rosanes, Aftalion, Dr. Menachemov, etc.\n\nAccording to Prof. Angelova Canetti remains unknown to the general Ruse public, therefore the society will continue its mission of preserving and disseminating the work of the Nobel Laureate. Among its activities are:\n\n• National Prize for Contemporary Writers named after Elias Canetti;\n\n• International Literary Festival;\n\n• international artist exhibitions. Concerts and performances;\n\n• international scientific conferences;\n\n• book translations and publishing.\n\nShare"
