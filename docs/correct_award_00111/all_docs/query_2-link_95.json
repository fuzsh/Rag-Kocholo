        "text": "Elias Canetti (Bulgarian: \"Елиас Канети\"; 25 July 1905 – 14 August 1994) was a Bulgarian-British citizen and German-language author, born in Ruse, Bulgaria to a merchant family. The family moved to Manchester, England, but after his father died in 1912 his mother took her three sons to Vienna, Austria. Elias was the eldest one.\n\nSubsequently, the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to Zürich and then (until 1924) to Frankfurt, where Canetti graduated from high school.\n\nCanetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature.\n\nHe gained a degree in chemistry from the University of Vienna in 1929 but never worked as a chemist.\n\nBy that time Canetti spoke Ladino (his native language), Bulgarian, German, English, and some French.\n\nCanetti returned to England in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage and became a British citizen in 1952.\n\nHe is known as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and non-fiction writer. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is noted for his non-fiction book 'Crowds and Power', among other works.\n\nIn the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years. He died in Zürich in 1994."
