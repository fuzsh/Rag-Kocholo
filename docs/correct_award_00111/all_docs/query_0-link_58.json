        "text": "Crowds and Power.\n\nCANETTI, Elias.\n\nItem Number: 3452\n\nLondon: Victor Gollancz, 1962.\n\nFirst edition in English of Canetti’s masterpiece. Octavo, original blue cloth. Signed by the author on the front free endpaper, “From Elias Canetti.” An excellent example in a very good dust jacket which shows some modest rubbing to the extremities. Translated from the German into English by Carol Stewart. Elias Canetti was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in literature on the basis of this work.\n\n\"Ranging from soccer crowds and political rallies to Bushmen and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Canetti exhaustively reviews the way crowds form, develop, and dissolve, using this taxonomy of mass movement as a key to the dynamics of social life. The style is abstract, erudite, and anecdotal, which makes Crowds and Power the sort of work that awes some readers with its profundity while irritating others with its elusiveness. Canetti loves to say something brilliant but counterintuitive, and then leave the reader to figure out both why he said it and whether it's really true\" (Richard Farr). Listed by the Times Literary Supplement as one of the 100 most influential books since World War II."
