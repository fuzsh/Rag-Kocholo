        "text": "Award\n\nAward\n\n1981 Nobel Prize in LiteratureElias CanettiDate\n\n15 October 1981 ( ) (announcement)\n\n10 December 1981\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1980 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1982 →\n\nThe 1981 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Bulgarian-born British writer Elias Canetti (1905–1994) \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power.\"[1][2][3] Though living in Great Britain since 1938 and became a British citizen in 1952, he wrote primarily in the German language. He is the first native of Bulgaria to win the prize.[4]\n\nMain article: Elias Canetti\n\nElias Canetti's body of literary work includes a novel, three plays, a study of mass movements, some author profiles and memoirs. The 1935 novel Die Blendung (\"The Deception\") was initially intended to be the first in a series of novels modeled after Honoré de Balzac's The Human Comedy series. Instead of finishing the series, Canetti devoted many years to social studies that resulted to the publication of Masse und Macht (\"Crowds and Power\", 1960), a psychological study of crowd behavior as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations. He is also known for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss Vienna: Die Gerettete Zunge (The Tongue Set Free, 1979); Die Fackel im Ohr (The Torch in My Ear, 1980), and Das Augenspiel (The Play of the Eyes, 1985).[4][5]"
