        "text": "(1905–94). Bulgarian novelist and playwright Elias Canetti was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1981. His works explore the emotions of crowds, the psychopathology of power, and the position of the individual at odds with the society around him.\n\nCanetti was born on July 25, 1905, in Ruse, Bulgaria. He was descended from Spanish Sephardic Jews (a branch of Jews who lived in Spain until persecution forced them to flee in the late 15th century). He wrote in German, his third language, his first two being Ladino (Judeo-Spanish) and English. He learned the latter when his parents settled in England. After his father’s death in 1913, he moved with his mother to Vienna. He was educated in Zürich, Frankfurt, and Vienna, receiving a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Vienna in 1929.\n\nCanetti’s interest in the psychology of crowds stemmed from his experiences in Frankfurt in the 1920s, where he witnessed street rioting over inflation that culminated in 1927 with the burning of the Vienna Palace of Justice by an angry mob. A planned eight-novel saga of the madness he saw around him was reduced to Die Blendung (1935; Auto-da-Fé, or The Tower of Babel). It tells the story of a scholar’s humiliation and destruction in the grotesque underworld of a city.\n\nShortly before World War II, Canetti immigrated to England and put aside literature to devote his time to research on mass psychology and the allure of fascism. The book Masse und Macht (1960; Crowds and Power) is an outgrowth of that compelling interest, which is also evident in Canetti’s three plays, Hochzeit (1932; The Wedding), Komödie der Eitelkeit (1950; Comedy of Vanity), and Die Befristeten (1964; The Numbered).\n\nIn addition to novels and plays, Canetti also published Die Provinz des Menschen: Aufzeichnungen 1942–1972 (1973; The Human Province), Das Geheimherz der Uhr: Aufzeichnungen 1973–1985 (1987; The Secret Heart of the Clock), and Die Fliegenpein (1992; The Agony of Flies), all excerpts from his notebooks; Der Ohrenzeuge: Fünfzig Charaktere (1974; Earwitness: Fifty Characters), a book of character sketches; and three volumes of his autobiography, Die Gerettete Zunge (1977; The Tongue Set Free), Die Fackel im Ohr (1980; The Torch in My Ear), and Das Augenspiel (1985; The Play of the Eyes). Canetti died on Aug. 14, 1994, in Zürich."
