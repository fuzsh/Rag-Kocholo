        "text": "Elias Canetti (Bulgarian: Елиас Канети; 25 July 1905 – 14 August 1994; ; German pronunciation: [eˈliːas kaˈnɛti]) was a German-language writer, born in Ruse, Bulgaria to a Sephardic Jewish family. They moved to Manchester, England, but his father died in 1912, and his mother took her three sons back to continental Europe. They settled in Vienna.\n\nCanetti moved to England in 1938 after the Anschluss to escape Nazi persecution. He became a British citizen in 1952. He is known as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and nonfiction writer. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is noted for his nonfiction book Crowds and Power, among other works."
