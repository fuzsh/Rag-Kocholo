        "text": "Nobel Prize winner Elias Canetti is an author who’s been on my radar for many years; and in fact I have a copy of what is probably his best-known book, Auto Da Fe, on the ever-teetering TBR. However, when I saw that lovely Fitzcarraldo Editions were issuing a newly translated book by him, in their Classics imprint, I was intrigued. Its title is “The Book Against Death” and it’s a work on which Canetti spent a good part of his life, though it never saw publication before his own death in 1994.\n\nBegun in 1937. the book collects together Canetti’s meditations on, thoughts about and diatribes against death. There are short aphorisms; longer commentaries; pieces which read like fictions; and quotes from other authors like Goethe, Walter Benjamin. Beckett and Robert Walser. Gathered together in sequential order and divided into annual sections, these writings trace Canetti’s relationship with the concept of death, and it’s definitely a complex one. He was born in 1905 and lost his father in 1912; so the death of his mother in 1937 was a further blow and most likely the trigger for his writings on death. His response to the latter reminded me very much of Barthes’ in the devastating effect it had on both authors. Canetti moved to England in 1938 to escape the Nazis (the family was Jewish), eventually becoming a British citizen, though living in Zurich for the last 20 years or so of his life. Yet despite his recognition as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and nonfiction writer, this work reflects a deeply troubled man.\n\nAm I Nuremberg? Am I Munich? I am every building in which children sleep. I am every open square across which feet scurry. Disgust wells up in me whenever I see the new tools of torture, the much improved, the best of all. As soon as it ends it will begin again. They love to blow things up. They like to fly around the world in half a day’s time just to wipe out cities. But what will happen when there are no more cities? What will they blow up then? Which schools, which children? The murderers will escape to the moon, and the sun must never again be eclipsed. Before their eyes cities are flattened like forests and mountains. The rivers rear up as they flow, exploded by a new type of lightning. There are no more birds.\n\nIn effect, Canetti is at war with death, actually stating himself to be “a mortal enemy of death”, and this was at a time when mass slaughter was sweeping the world. The notes go through the time when Canetti’s people were being shipped to the death camps to meet an unimaginable end, and this is a theme which runs through the book. Post-war, the writings continue to rage against the holocaust, but as the years go on Canetti reacts to the changing landscape around him, with ever more devastating methods of death being devised. He responds to world events – Vietnam, the deaths of Russian Cosmonauts, the threat posed by the atomic bomb – yet underlying his narrative is the thread of the holocaust which runs through the book and informs his thoughts.\n\nCanetti is not bound by any writing conventions, and he obviously jotted down obsessively whatever occurred to him concerning death. He switches between first and third person; builds in personal recollections and meditations on the loss of those he knows and loves; and the quotations are pulled from a wide range of sources. This is not a book with any humour or irony built into it; indeed there is often a sense of despair when Canetti seems unable to cope with the horrors of the world. Yet, it’s often a deeply moving book, and one which certainly made me aware of our human mortality, and also how fragile the thread is which holds us to life.\n\nWrite until your eyes close or the pencil falls from your hand, Write without wasting a second or thinking about what and how it should sound; write from a feeling of untapped life that has become so huge that it is like a massive mountain gathering inside of you; write without setting up a hundred different plans and restrictions, and with the danger that it will not last, and the danger that it will fall to pieces; write because you are still breathing and because your heart, which is probably already diseased, still beats; write until something from the mighty mountains of your life is carried away, since an entire nation of giants could not carry it all away; write until your eyes close forever; write until you choke to death.\n\nAs the years pass and Canetti comes closer to his own death, his views do seem to change slightly; part of this is due to the birth of his daughter, Johanna, when he was approaching his seventies. Having a child shifts his viewpoint, leading him to meditate whether we fight the fear of death by producing those who’ll carry on the race. Certainly he becomes slightly more accepting of things although still battling against senseless death. Canetti died at the age of 89 in 1994, and this book was by necessity unfinished.\n\nThe manuscript he left behind was nearly 2,000 pages long, and was first published in German (the language in which he wrote) in 2014. As far as I’m aware it was edited for his estate by Sven Hanuschek, Peter Von Matt and Kristian Washinger, assisted by Laura Schutz and with an index by Tina Nachtmann. The translation to English is by Peter Filkins and so finally Canetti’s great unfinished project saw the light of day.\n\nWhat will become of all that has piled up within you, so much, so much, an enormous stock of memories and habits, deferred questions, frozen answers, thoughts, emotions, tender feelings, hardships, everything there, everything there, what will become of it all the moment life extinguishes within you?\n\nDylan Thomas’s great poem urged us to “rage against the dying of the light” and certainly it seems from this book that Elias Canetti spent a good part of his life doing just that. “The Book Against Death” draws on so much – religion, philosophy, literature, art – and is a book best read slowly and carefully, dipping into each section gradually so as to absorb its thoughts. This is the fifth title to be released in the Fitzcarraldo Classics series, and it’s a remarkable read, full of much which resonates and much which will stay with me. I could have shared many more thought-provoking quotes than I actually have from this powerful and unforgettable book – highly recommended.\n\n(Review copy kindly provided by the publishers, for which many thanks.)"
