        "text": "Thomas H. Falk. Elias Canetti. New York. Twayne. 1993. 185 pages. $22.95.\n\nAlthough Elias Canetti (b. 1905) won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981 (see WLT 56:1, pp. 5-9), and although all his major works have appeared in English translation, he has remained a relatively unknown author in the United States. He has written few purely literary works--a novel (Auto-da-Fe, 1936) and three stage works (The Wedding, 1932; Comedy of Vanity, 1950; and Life-Terms, 1964)--and these are so intellectually demanding and bleak in their resolution as to preclude a popular reception here. As Thomas Falk stresses in his monograph, which is intended to introduce Canetti to an American audience, he is a scholar's or a writer's writer and is primarily concerned with philosophical issues such as the nature of language or the ways in which the masses can be manipulated. Hence, Falk discusses Canetti's life and work in the context of \"the central theme\" of both, which is also the title of the latter's magnum opus: Crowds and Power (1960). In seven chapters Falk presents all the major works, locating them within a European intellectual framework and tracing their reception both in the German-speaking and the English-speaking world. At the end of the book he provides the American reader with an annotated bibliography of secondary literature in English in addition to the works listed in the general bibliography. As the first book-length monograph devoted to Canetti's life and works, Falk's study should prove a valuable resource for American readers."
