        "text": "Elías Canetti (1905-1994) was born in Ruse, from a merchant family of Sephardic origin, eldest son of Jacques Canetti, a Jew of Spanish origin (the paternal ancestors were born with the surname of Cañete, but, after the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, they changed their surname), and of Mathilde Arditti, born from a wealthy Sephardic Jewish family of Italian origin (maternal ancestors were Sephardim from Livorno who settled in Bulgaria). The language of his childhood was the Ladino or Spanish Judeo spoken in the family (in his autobiography, associated with strong memories of childhood), but little Elías had his first experiences with the German language, which was the language of private use by the parents (who considered it the language of the theater and that of their years of study in Vienna).\n\nAfter learning the Bulgarian language for everyday use, he had to learn English when his father decided to move to work in Manchester in 1911. The decision was received with enthusiasm by Mathilde Arditti, a cultured and liberal woman, who had to take Elías out of the influence of his paternal grandfather, who had joined the Talmudic school. After his father died, the following year the family emigrated to Vienna where he lived through the First World War. Once settled in Austria, he mainly used German. In 1916 the family moved to Zurich, where Canetti spent, between 1916 and 1921, his happiest years.\n\nIn this period, despite the presence of his younger siblings, Canetti's relationship with his mother (who since 1913 suffered from periodic depressive attacks) became increasingly closer, conflictive and marked by mutual dependence.\n\nGermany and Austria\n\nIn 1921 the family moved to Frankfurt, where Canetti attended the popular demonstrations after the assassination of Minister Walter Rathenau, the first experience with the behavior of the masses that left an indelible impression on him. In 1924 she returned with her brother Georges to Vienna, where she graduated in chemistry in 1929, although her great passion was literature and she dedicated herself to it. Canetti quickly integrated into the Viennese cultural elite, where he studied the works of Otto Weininger, Sigmund Freud (who aroused his distrust from the beginning) and Arthur Schnitzler, and attended the famous lectures by Karl Kraus, polemicist and moralist, who recognized as his main teacher. In one of these cultural meetings she met the Sephardic writer Venetiana (Veza) Täubner-Calderón, very intelligent and who had lacked her right forearm since her birth. In 1934 he married her, despite her mother's opposition.\n\nUnder the influence of the memory of the Frankfurt events, a book project on dough began to take shape in 1925. In 1928 he went to work in Berlin as a translator of American books (especially Upton Sinclair), and there he met Bertolt Brecht, Isaak Babel and George Grosz. Two years later he received his doctorate in chemistry, but did not pursue the profession in which he never showed interest. Between 1930 and 1931 he began working on the novel The blinding (Auto of faith), published in 1935, and returned to Vienna where he continued to frequent literary and artistic circles: Robert Musil, Fritz Wotruba, Alban Berg, Anna and Alma Mahler.\n\nAt this time he also met closely the conductor Hermann Scherchen, whose interesting and complex personality he describes in the part of his autobiography from 1931 to 1937, entitled: The game of eyes, chapter The conductor of the orchestra And next, also narrating Scherchen's passion for Anna Mahler, daughter of the musician Gustav Mahler and notable sculptor.\n\nIn 1932 he published his first play, Wedding. Two years later it was the turn of The Comedy of the Vanities. In 1937 he moved to Paris due to the death of his mother, a fact that marked him deeply and symbolically closes the third volume of his autobiography.\n\nLondon\n\nIn 1938, after Kristallnacht in Austria, Canetti moved first to Paris and then to London, where he obtained British citizenship in 1952. It was in Britain that he lived poorly and worked on one of his magnum opuses, Mass and power (from German: Masse und Macht), notably influenced by the Nazi Germany that he had been able to see up close. The next two decades, he dedicated himself exclusively to this project on the psychology of the masses, whose first and only volume, Mass and power, was published in 1960.\n\nIn 1954 he spent a period in Morocco, following a film shoot, a stay from which the volume emerged The voices of Marrakech.\n\nThe premiere of his drama Those placed took place in Oxford in 1956. His wife Veza, with whom he shared his socialist enthusiasm and his veneration for Karl Kraus, committed suicide in 1963 after the failure of their marriage, perhaps due to Elias's frequent betrayals. Uncomfortable with the English mentality and customs, he was very critical of the country's intellectuality, as he describes in his book Party under the bombs, in which he left a merciless portrait of his lover, the British novelist Iris Murdoch.\n\nZurich\n\nIn 1971 he married Hera Buschor, a museologist living in Zurich, who gave him a daughter, Johanna, the following year, an event that convinced the couple to settle permanently in Zurich, at Klosbachstrasse 88 in Züriberg (hill east of the city). In 1969 he was published Kafka's other process. About the letters to Felice (Der Andere Prozess. Briefe an Felice) which analyzes the correspondence between Kafka and Felice Bauer.\n\nIn the 70s he toured Europe on several occasions to give lectures. In 1977 the first volume of his autobiography was published, with great success among critics and the public. It followed with two more volumes and a fourth and final part published in 2003 after his death, completed by his daughter based on her notes.\n\nAn author focused like no other on thought, he published various aphoristic essays: in 1973: Die Province des Menschen (The province of man), an experience that he renewed later in 1992, with The torment of the flies (Fliegenpein Die). He also wrote a gallery of “characters” in 1974, in line with Theophrastus and Jean de La Bruyère, with Der Ohrenzeuge (The hearing witness).\n\nIn 1972 he received the Georg Büchner Prize, the most important literary distinction in the German language, and in 1975, the Universities of Manchester and Munich awarded him honorary doctorates. In 1981 he received the Nobel Prize in Literature, “for works characterized by broad vision, richness of ideas and artistic power.” Among the foundations of the Nobel award, its study of mass movements and especially the brutality of German National Socialism and dictatorships in general is also mentioned. All of his personal work will not be known until 2024 due to his own testamentary provisions.\n\nAfter Hera's death (1988), Elias Canetti returned to Zurich, where he died in 1994.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
