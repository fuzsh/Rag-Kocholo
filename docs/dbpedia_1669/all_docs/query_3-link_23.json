        "text": "Larry Brown\n\nFor all of the success that Larry Brown enjoyed as an Olympian, an all-conference guard at North Carolina, and a three-time ABA All Star, he may be best known as a teacher of the game. In a remarkable coaching career that has spanned more than four decades, Brown has taught well. He is the only coach in NBA history to lead seven different teams to the playoffs, and championships at both the collegiate and professional levels lend credence to his approach to the game. Brown began coaching in the ABA with the Carolina Cougars and Denver Nuggets and was a three-time ABA Coach of the Year. In the NBA, he has resurrected dormant teams, including the Denver Nuggets, New Jersey Nets, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers, Indiana Pacers, and Philadelphia 76ers. Brown guided the 76ers to the NBA Finals in 2001 for the first time in 18 years and then led the Detroit Pistons to the 2004 NBA championship. Brown coached two of the most storied college programs in history, leading UCLA to the 1980 Final Four and Kansas to the 1988 NCAA title.\n\nAbout The Hall\n\nLocated in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame is an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to promoting, preserving and celebrating the game of basketball at every level.
