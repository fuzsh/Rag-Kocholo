        "text": "Maxi Kleber could return to action for the Dallas Mavericks today, as Jason Kidd’s men look to book their place in the NBA Finals by completing a series sweep against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nWhat injury does Kleber have?\n\nAhead of Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, the Mavericks have upgraded Kleber’s injury status from out to questionable. The power forward hasn’t played since 3 May, after suffering a right shoulder AC joint separation in Game 6 of Dallas’ first-round series against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe German missed the entirety of the Conference Semi-Finals - in which the Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-2 - and has watched on from the sidelines for the first three games of the Conference Finals. After Sunday’s 116-107 win over the Timberwolves at American Airlines Center, Dallas lead the series 3-0 - and will seal a 4-0 whitewash with victory in Texas today.\n\nWill Kleber play today for Dallas?\n\nKleber took part in Mavericks practice on Monday, and reportedly has a good chance of making his comeback to the court today. Quoting league sources, NBA insider Marc Stein says the 32-year-old is “on course to make his return to the lineup” in Game 4.\n\nWho else is on the Mavericks’ injury report?\n\nMavericks guard Luka Doncic has again been listed as questionable today, as the Slovenian continues to deal with a right knee sprain and left ankle soreness. Doncic picked up the knee problem in Game 3 against the Clippers, before hurting his ankle in Game 2 against the Thunder.\n\nDespite his ongoing fitness issues, Doncic has played in every postseason clash so far. He registered 33 points in Dallas’ weekend win in Game 3 against the Timberwolves, and has averaged 29.3 points across his 15 appearances in the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nDereck Lively II is reported as doubtful for Game 4, having been forced to leave Sunday’s Game 3 win after sustaining a neck sprain in a collision with Minnesota’s Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nOlivier Maxence-Prosper remains unavailable to Dallas through injury, as the Canadian recovers from an ankle problem that has kept him out since late April.\n\nTimberwolves vs Mavericks: Game 4 start time, how to watch\n\nIn Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, the Dallas Mavericks host the Minnesota Timberwolves today, Tuesday 28 May 2024, at American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. Tip-off is scheduled for 8:30pm ET / 5:30pm PT. Viewers in the US will be able to watch the game on TNT, and can stream the action on the online platform fuboTV, which offers new users a free trial.\n\nEnjoy the Timberwolves vs the Mavericks live on fuboTV.\n\nWhen did the Mavs last reach the NBA Finals?"
