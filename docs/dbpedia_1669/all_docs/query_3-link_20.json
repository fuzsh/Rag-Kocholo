        "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers will host the 2026 All-Star Game in their new arena on Feb. 15, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced Tuesday.\n\nThe game and the adjacent All-Star festivities will take place at the Intuit Dome, which is still under construction. Silver made the announcement during a media conference at the developing venue, which will open in August. He was joined by Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, Clippers president of business operations Gillian Zucker, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr.\n\nSilver acknowledged that the Clippers might be the first team to be named host for the All-Star game without a completed arena.\n\nThe Clippers broke ground on the 18,000-seat arena in 2021. It's located in Inglewood near SoFi Stadium and the Los Angeles Forum. Silver's reveal of the 75th NBA All-Star game site confirmed a previous report from The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nThe Clippers offered a look inside the arena Tuesday alongside the All-Star announcement.\n\nThe Clippers currently play at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, a site they share with the Lakers. The Intuit Dome will provide the Clippers a home of their own as they seek to put distance between themselves and their Los Angeles rivals and further build their identity under Ballmer.\n\nThe Clippers have started selling season tickets at the Intuit Dome for the 2024-25 season. Ballmer has touted the Inglewood complex, including SoFi Stadium, as the “entertainment capital of the world.”\n\nWith Inglewood slated to host in 2026, the NBA has the site of its next three All-Star weekends planned out. The Pacers will host this year's festivities in Indianapolis. The Warriors are scheduled to host the 2025 All-Star weekend in San Francisco."
