        "text": "ESPN worried Jeff Van Gundy still had the coaching itch and could leave them high and dry.\n\nWhile the former Knicks coach shined as an NBA analyst for ESPN before being included in the company’s recent layoffs, top network executives worried Van Gundy could potentially leave his cushy television job to return to the sidelines, according to The Post’s Andrew Marchand.\n\n“While Van Gundy was one of the best game analysts in sports, top ESPN executives were wary of his desire to coach again,” Marchand wrote.\n\nVan Gundy established himself as one of the top basketball announcers but there had long been speculation about whether he’d eventually get another shot leading a team.\n\nThe 61-year-old last coached in 2006-07 when he led the Rockets to a 52-30 record, but is most known for his time leading the Knicks – and grabbing Alonzo Mourning’s leg during the 1998 playoffs.\n\nHe guided the Knicks for seven seasons from 1995-2002, leading the team to its last NBA Finals appearance in 1999, and then spent four seasons in Houston from 2003-07.\n\nVan Gundy owns a career .575 winning percentage (430-318) and interviewed with the New Orleans Pelicans for their open position in 2015.\n\nSince his dismissal, he has been “actively exploring” a return to coaching, according to Sports Illustrated.\n\nHe discussed assistant roles with the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics, and SI reported mutual interest between Van Gundy and the Washington Wizards.\n\nWith Van Gundy out of the mix and potentially returning to the sidelines, ESPN is set to promote Doris Burke to its NBA Finals team along with former Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers.\n\nThose two would join Hall-of-Fame announcer Mike Breen, who also calls Knicks games for MSG Network.\n\nESPN also laid off Mark Jackson, the ex-Knick and former Golden State Warriors head coach, on Monday as part of their announcing shakeup.\n\nVan Gundy was one of the higher-profile ESPN talents let go in the recent round of layoffs.\n\nHe received plenty of praise for his analysis during his 16 years of coverage and called NBA Finals games, but sources said Van Gundy’s critical analysis of the NBA and its officiating irked the league over the years.\n\nRivers, who served as a television analyst for the 2004 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Lakers, is more popular among NBA executives than Van Gundy.\n\nBut just like Van Gundy, he could be lured with a potential coaching opening following his dismissal from the 76ers following three consecutive ousters in the Eastern Conference semifinals."
