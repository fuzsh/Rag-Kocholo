        "text": "The NBA Finals are set. All eyes are on Kristaps Porzingis, who may finally return from a calf injury in time for the championship series.\n\nThe Boston Celtics center played for the Dallas Mavericks – Boston's Finals opponent – from 2019-2022, setting up a \"revenge match\" storyline. In addition, the Latvian big man has so far missed every game since suffering his injury on April 29, during Game 4 of the Celtics' clash with the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nBoston has fared well even without Porzingis in the lineup, having just four losses in the 25 games he missed in the regular season with various injuries and just one loss in the 10 games he's missed during this playoff run. However, given his averages of 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game during the regular season, the Celtics are an even stronger team when he's healthy.\n\nHere's the latest news on Porzingis' injury status according to recent reports and a message from the big man himself.\n\nBOSTON CELTICS: Eastern Conference winners now just four wins from passing Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA titles\n\nKristaps Porzingis injury update\n\nThe last time Porzingis spoke to reporters was in early May, saying his injury was \"something ... not nothing.\" He has been day-to-day with his recovery since then.\n\nOn May 29, he posted to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) thanking the fans for their support before writing (in Latvian) \"See you in the finals.\"\n\nOn Friday, two days after the tweet, Porzingis stuck around for extended 3-point drills after practice. The next day, \"he went through everything that the team did\" in practice, according to head coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nNBA FINALS: It's Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving vs. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for the NBA crown\n\nWhen do the NBA Finals start?\n\nThe NBA Finals begin Thursday, June 6. Game 1 tips off at the TD Garden in Boston at 8:30 p.m. ET with coverage provided by ABC.\n\nHOW TO WATCH: See all NBA Finals action with a fuboTV subscription\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.
