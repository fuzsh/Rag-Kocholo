        "text": "David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves star guard Anthony Edwards created a viral moment when he told TNT's Charles Barkley to \"bring ya ass\" to Minnesota for the Western Conference Finals.\n\nNow, Edwards' one-liner is being used to attract visitors to the state, as BringYaAss.com has been established as a website that redirects to the official Minnesota tourism website.\n\nThe viral moment occurred after the Timberwolves overcame a 20-point second-half deficit to defeat the Denver Nuggets 98-90 in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday. Edwards, who is known for his colorful personality, also obliged when Barkley requested to receive some food recommendations when he makes the trip to Minnesota for the Western Conference Finals, which begin on Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nEdwards' line quickly gained a lot of traction. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responded to a request to make the phrase the state's official tourism slogan. The Minnesota State Fair even adopted the phrase to attract Barkley as he looks for food recommendations.\n\nThe Timberwolves are in the conference finals for the first time since 2004. While Edwards didn't have the best performance in Game 7 against Denver, he has been the catalyst for Minnesota's success during the playoffs.\n\nEdwards leads the Timberwolves with 28.9 points and 1.7 steals per game in the playoffs while also adding 6.2 rebounds and 5.9 assists. The 2020 No. 1 overall pick has established himself as a superstar and one of the future faces of the NBA.\n\nEdwards and the Timberwolves will try to get off to a strong start when they host the Mavericks in Game 1 on Wednesday."
