        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The final four of the NBA Playoffs is set. In the Western Conference Finals, two unlikely teams get ready to do battle, as the Minnesota Timberwolves host the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.\n\nWatch the NBA Playoffs on Sling\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS\n\n(5) Dallas Mavericks vs. (3) Minnesota Timberwolves (Game 1)\n\nWhen: Wednesday, May 22\n\nTime: 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Target Center (Minneapolis, Minn.)\n\nChannel: TNT\n\nStream: Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nOn one hand, there is a team that has not been to the NBA Finals in a while. On the other, a team trying to get there for the first time.\n\nThe Mavericks are having an incredible run. After missing the playoffs last season, Dallas came back with a solid regular season, and took down the no. 4-seed, the Los Angeles Clippers, in the opening round of the postseason. Then, they took on the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder, with Luka Doncic winning the battle between he and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, helping the Mavs taking the series in six games. This is the second time in three seasons that Dallas has made it to the conference finals, losing to the Golden State Warriors in 2022.\n\nThe Mavericks have not been to the Finals since winning it all in 2011.\n\nIn the 34-year history of the Timberwolves, this is just the second time the team has ever been to the conference finals. The first time they made it this far was in 2004, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. This yearâ€™s Minnesota squad has been battle-tested and has proven they deserve to be here. Led by Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns, the T-Wolves swept the Phoenix Suns in round one, before a roaring comeback in Game 7 against the defending champion Denver Nuggets put Minnesota four wins away from the Finals.\n\nThe Timberwolves have never made it to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe T-Wolves did have the Mavericks number during the regular season, winning three of the four meetings."
