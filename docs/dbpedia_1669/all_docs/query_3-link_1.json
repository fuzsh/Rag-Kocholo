Red Auerbach called it the greatest play he had ever seen, both for Bird’s physical ability to make the shot and his basketball instinct to get into position for the rebound. The Celtics won the game 98-95, and went on to take the series in six games.\n\nMay 5, 1986\n\nNBA legends Rick Barry, Walt Frazier and Pete Maravich were among five men inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nMay 5, 1993\n\nAlonzo Mourning of the Charlotte Hornets nails a top-of-the-key jumper with 0.4 seconds left in Game 4 against the Boston Celtics.

Los Suns beat the San Antonio Spurs, 110-102 in a conference semi-final contest.\n\nMay 6, 1970\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers converted 57 of 94 field goal attempts in a 135-113 Game 6 victory over New York in the NBA Finals.
