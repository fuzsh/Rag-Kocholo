        "text": "Inside the NBA, branded for sponsorship purposes as Inside the NBA presented by Kia, (formerly, Inside the NBA presented by Hyundai in 1999?-mid 2013.) is the postgame show for NBA on TNT broadcasts. The program features host Ernie Johnson with analysts Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal, with various supporting and fill-in analysts, of which includes current and former players.\n\nOverview[]\n\n1989–2000[]\n\nInside the NBA debuted after TNT was awarded the rights to broadcast NBA games in the 1989–90 season. In its first season, there were no permanent hosts nor analysts. Craig Sager, Hannah Storm, Vince Cellini, Tim Brando and Fred Hickman shared hosting duties at various points of the season. It was not until the following season that Ernie Johnson Jr., at the time a sideline reporter, took over as the show's full-time host, a role he retains to this day.\n\nInitially, Inside the NBA had a simple format, focusing more on recaps of the day's games. Occasionally Johnson invited a former or current NBA player or coach to sit in as a guest analyst. It was not until 1998, however, that the addition of Kenny Smith gave a glimpse of what was to come.\n\n2000–present[]\n\nSmith's entry brought insightful analysis and a comedic element to Inside the NBA, something that would become a theme in the years to come. But it was before the 2000–01 season that the show found its perfect foil for Smith.\n\nNewly-retired former NBA All-Star Charles Barkley joined TNT that year and became notorious for his controversial comments and outrageous bets.\n\nIn late 2002, Barkley told Kenny Smith that he would \"kiss [his] ass\" if Houston Rockets then-rookie Yao Ming scored nineteen points in a game, which was followed by Yao doing exactly that later that week. As a result, on Listen Up! With Charles Barkley and Ernie Johnson that Thursday, Barkley kissed the rear end of a donkey that Smith brought into the studio. In 2002, a controversial Sports Illustrated cover, in which Barkley was portrayed in chains (as a slave), led to a sometimes heated debate on the TNT studio show. During the 2006 NBA Playoffs, in response to performer David Blaine's attempt to stay under water for nine minutes, Barkley duplicated the stunt with a small tub of water but only managed to stay under water for 24 seconds. Barkley has also been weighed on air several times, and once said \"bullshit\" live on air.\n\nFollowing the release of Django Unchained, Barkley will joke he isn't going to \"take it any more master,\" referring to Ernie Johnson. Johnson has a whip sound effect he uses when Barkley or O'Neal's conversations go far off topic, and for a segment called \"The Whip\" that provoked jokes from the other hosts - for example, Smith saying, \"Revolt, revolt!\" Smith has also been the brunt of jokes before, an example being the \"retirement\" of his jersey on air. In reality, it was a Tracy McGrady jersey with Smith's name put on a clothesline and \"raised\" to the TNT studio roof on a clothesline with various undergarments. Most of the jokes were featured as Ernie Johnson's E.J.'s Neat-O Stat of the Night, the show's closing segment.\n\nIn addition to winning nine Emmy Awards, it was announced live on the May 11th, 2016 edition that Inside was to be inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in October 2016, becoming just the twelfth program to receive the honor and the third sports show to do so after SportsCenter and Monday Night Football.\n\nThe popularity of the program has led the NBA to air reruns of the show (as well as reruns other TNT NBA studio programs, NBA Tip-Off presented by Carmax, (Formerly NBA Tip-Off presented by Gatorade in late-2002? to mid 2004, and Nokia sponsorship in 2005 to mid-2006 and Autotrader.com now Autotrader in 2007 to 2020.) the American Express Halftime Report [formerly, AT&T halftime report in 2001-2002 and Verizon Wireless Halftime Report, T-Moblie Halftime Report, Sprint Halftime Report.] and Game Break) on the TNT Overtime on NBA.com. Analysts from the show have also been featured in the popular NBA 2K video game series beginning with NBA 2K15. Beginning in 2011, the team has also covered the NCAA men's basketball tournament as CBS began partnering with Turner for NCAA March Madness.\n\nDuring the 2020 and 2021 playoffs, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green made occasional appearances on Inside the NBA. In 2022, Green was added to TNT's analyst roster, and would contribute occasionally on the show while still an active player.\n\nDuring the 2021–22 season, Inside the NBA airs after TNT Tuesday games during the NFL regular season and on Thursday nights once football season ends. TNT moved its marquee games to Tuesday in the autumn and early in the winter in order to avoid competition with Thursday Night Football. The postgame shows after TNT Tuesday games, beginning in January, were rebranded as the NBA on TNT Postgame Show, with Adam Lefkoe as host and analysts O'Neal, Candace Parker and Dwyane Wade.\n\nCatchphrases and quotes[]\n\n\"Win or go home\" – The main tagline TNT uses for its playoff coverage. With rounds in the NBA Playoffs conducted in a best-of-seven format, the statement carries more weight in meaning as a series extends to its finale. For all of TNT's Game 7s — Dallas-Sacramento in 2003; Miami-New Orleans and Sacramento-Minnesota in 2004; Indiana-Boston, Dallas-Houston and Detroit-Miami in 2005; L.A. Lakers-Phoenix, San Antonio-Dallas and L.A. Clippers-Phoenix in 2006; a May 3 triple-header of Atlanta-Indiana, Memphis-Oklahoma City, and Golden State-L.A. Clippers in 2014; San Antonio-L.A. Clippers in 2015; and Indiana-Toronto and Golden State-Oklahoma City in 2016 — the phrase has been used in the pregame montage and in the graphics during the game.\n\n\"Gone fishin'\" – The most notable of TNT's catchphrases. It is used whenever a team is knocked out of the playoffs (or a team failed to make the playoffs), and is usually accompanied by doctored photos of players on the team on fishing boats with analyst Kenny Smith. Reportedly, it has its roots in the 90s - when the Suns had a chance to eliminate a team, their gorilla mascot would have a fishing pole on hand to indicate the opponents would be \"gone fishin'\". Occasionally, Barkley, Smith and O'Neal will wear fishing hats when they anticipate a team's elimination from the playoffs. In addition to players, notable figures from the city of the eliminated team often show up (e.g., Condoleezza Rice, who was doctored into a Gone Fishin' photo after the Washington Wizards were eliminated from the 2005 playoffs). The catchphrase has gotten popular enough to warrant its own page on NBA.com and has also become a metaphor for being eliminated from the playoffs. TBS uses a similar phrase for when a team gets knocked out of the MLB playoffs, called \"Gone huntin'\", as most North American hunting seasons occur in mid-to-late fall.\n\nRecurring segments[]\n\nShaqtin' a Fool – A blooper segment started by O'Neal when he joined the show in 2012 that has become popular since. Frequent nominees include JaVale McGee, Kendrick Perkins, Nick Young, Otto Porter, and Brandon Knight although even All-Stars like LeBron James, Blake Griffin, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook have been featured.\n\nArea 21 – A segment hosted by Kevin Garnett, who joined the show following his retirement before the 2016-17 season. Noted for being more informal and by the presence of a \"cuss button\" for when Garnett or a guest wants to swear, which has sometimes gone unused.\n\nEJ's Neat-O Stat of the Night – The traditional ending segment, sometimes noted for its lack of continued sponsorship (if there is no sponsor, the phrases \"Presented by...no one,\" and \"Unsullied by sponsorship since 1989!\" are used). However, Johnson has used sponsorships like: Dave & Buster's, Taco Bell, Jim Beam, JBL, and EA Sports as sponsors of the show. It can sometimes feature interesting or humorous stats, but it can also eschew the stats in favor of a humorous segment. Some examples include...\n\nThe presentation of a Justice League comic made specially by DC Comics for NBA All-Star Weekend 2014 featuring Superman, Green Lantern, Flash and Steel (who O'Neal once played in a movie) and guest-starring O'Neal, Barkley, Smith and Johnson.\n\nA segment featuring Kobe Bryant where Smith tried to duplicate Bryant putting on Nikes and jumping over a speeding car.\n\nWho He Play For?, A start-of-season customary game where Barkley is challenged to name the new teams of a number of NBA journeymen.\n\nA segment reminiscent of a scene in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy where Johnson pulled a Teleprompter prank on Barkley.\n\nA free-throw shooting contest between O'Neal and Kristen Ledlow, who had recently been named co-host of the revived Inside Stuff.\n\nTracy McGrady pitching to Johnson, including O'Neal leading the crew in baseball chants and songs, following McGrady pitching one game for the Sugar Land Skeeters.\n\nThe official announcement of Inside being inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame.\n\nAudio Toons, old conversations and past events, animated by Cartoon Network.\n\nPlayers Only – From 2017 to 2019, this was the name given to the Monday edition, reserved for players-turned-analysts such as Webber, O'Neal, Garnett, Isiah Thomas, Chris Bosh and Baron Davis. WNBA players such as Lisa Leslie and Candace Parker would sit in as analysts for these broadcasts.\n\nNotable moments[]\n\nSome segments of Inside have become famous and are sometimes referenced in callbacks on other episodes, or in other media.\n\nCharles Barkley's race with Dick Bavetta[]\n\nWhile filling in for an injured Steve Kerr on a Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento Kings broadcast, Charles Barkley made disparaging comments about the age of referee Dick Bavetta. The conversation between Barkley and play-by-play man Marv Albert eventually led him to comment that he could outrun Bavetta, and any other man of his age (Bavetta was 67 at the time).\n\nThis led Johnson and Smith to note that Bavetta, a physically fit referee whose job required him to run up and down the court on a nightly basis, would likely beat Barkley in a race. Bavetta challenged Barkley to a footrace, which was then scheduled for the upcoming All-Star Weekend.\n\nThe race was heavily hyped on the Internet, receiving some mainstream attention as well. Several NBA players weighed in with predictions, and the overwhelming majority picked Bavetta to win the race.\n\nDespite being the underdog, Barkley won the race by a comfortable margin. Both men ended up falling after the race; Bavetta dove for the finish line, and Barkley stumbled backwards and fell upon victory. With the race decided, the two exchanged a friendly hug and kiss. The race raised $50,000 for charity, and All-Star Saturday Night on TNT drew its highest number of television households in its twenty-two-year history.\n\nCharles Barkley's beef with Oakland[]\n\nDuring the 2007 NBA Playoffs, following the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors' upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks, Barkley made some degrading comments about Oakland, California, saying things such as \"it makes me mad, mad that they're in Golden State and not LA\" and \"it's not a city\". In response, the scoreboard at the Oracle Arena began showing a graphic of the Warriors' mascot throwing a pie at Barkley.\n\nOakland native and NBA legend Gary Payton, in his trademark competitive, trash-talking style, went around Oakland with a video camera to rebuke some of Barkley's comments and get some of the locals' opinions on Barkley and his comments, with Payton providing some of his own comments about \"Sir Charles\" and providing quips such as \"It ain't no thrift store, it's Oakland\". The humorous segment, which also included embarrassing vintage coverage of Barkley being dunked on in a game against Golden State, aired during Inside the NBA's playoff coverage of the series between the Warriors and the Utah Jazz. The clip culminated with a shot of Payton standing in front of the San Francisco Bay saying \"How do you feel about my city now, Chuck? ... Now, come see me, in person, here. I've got a surprise for you, too, a lot of Krispy Kreme donuts.\" The humorous controversy was subsequently put to rest.\n\nKenny Smith's solidarity with the players' boycott in 2020[]\n\nIn response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted Game 5 of their series against the Orlando Magic on August 26, 2020. Later that day, the NBA announced that in light of the Bucks' decision, all games for the day were postponed. In support for the players boycott, Kenny Smith walked out of the set while the show was aired live. “I think the biggest thing now — as a Black man and a former player — I think it’s best for me to not be here tonight,” Smith said.\n\nReception[]\n\nInside, since Barkley joined the show during the 2000–01 season, has become a particularly popular show due to its combination of league highlights with unscripted banter among the panelists. Bill Simmons of ESPN.com wrote in May 2002, when Johnson, Smith, and Barkley made up the core panel, that Inside was \"the greatest TV studio show I've seen.\" Simmons observed, \"A postgame show that occasionally improves on the ratings from the actual game? How rare is that?\"\n\nIn 2014, the New York Times described Inside as \"one of the most freewheeling, unpredictable and funny talk shows on television.\" The \"On Comedy\" columnist described O'Neal as the \"weak link\" but generally praised the interplay between the panelists in ways that often veer far from discussions of basketball games.\n\nCommentators have praised Inside the NBA for its panelists' willingness to have serious conversations when circumstances demand them. The panel's comments about the 2016 presidential election, particularly Johnson's, were praised in national media. Kenny Smith's solidarity with social justice protests in 2020 was described as \"impactful\" by a columnist for Sportscasting. \"The outpouring of well wishes for Johnson and his family has shown that there may not be a more beloved person in sports media,\" wrote Jimmy Traina in Sports Illustrated in an article about the panel's public support for Johnson on Inside after his son Michael died. Johnson used his Twitter account and his appearance on Inside the following week to gratefully acknowledge the support he received from his coworkers and from the public.\n\nAwards[]\n\nAs of the end of 2021, the show has won fifteen Sports Emmy Awards. Six times for the best daily show (2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2014), five times for the best weekly show (2012, 2014, 2019, 2020, 2021), two times for the best limited run show (2019, 2021), one for the best decoration and art visuals (2016) and one for the best social TV experience (2019). Johnson has also won six awards as a studio host (2002, 2007, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2021) and Barkley has won four as a studio analyst (2012, 2013, 2017, 2020).\n\nInside was inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in October 2016, becoming the 12th program to receive the honor and the third sports show after SportsCenter and Monday Night Football.\n\nRelated shows[]\n\nOutside the NBA[]\n\nOutside the NBA is a Facebook Watch only TV show that debuted on October 20, 2017 where the cast talks about all subjects outside of the NBA.\n\nThe Inside Story[]\n\nTNT aired The Inside Story, a four-part miniseries documenting Inside the NBA, during the NBA All-Star Break in March 2021. Each 90-minute (with commercials) episode focused on one core panelist. The miniseries was nominated for a Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary Series at the 43rd Sports Emmy Awards.\n\nThe Steam Room Podcast[]\n\nThe Steam Room is a video podcast hosted on YouTube starring Johnson and Barkley, named after a running joke from Inside. The podcast primarily consists of interviews and interactions with celebrities that are friends of Barkley and Johnson, sports media personalities, former NBA legends, comedians, and staff members.\n\nPersonalities[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nInside the NBA[]\n\nErnie Johnson – Thursday host\n\nKevin Frazier – fill-in host\n\nAdam Lefkoe - fill-in host\n\nShaquille O'Neal – analyst and Shaqtin' a Fool Presenter (also appears on Tuesdays with the NBA on TNT Postgame Show)\n\nKenny Smith – analyst\n\nCharles Barkley – analyst\n\nDraymond Green – analyst\n\nNBA on TNT Tuesday[]\n\nAdam Lefkoe – host\n\nShaquille O'Neal - analyst\n\nCandace Parker - analyst\n\nDwyane Wade – analyst\n\nFormer[]\n\nMarc Fein – fill-in studio host\n\nMagic Johnson – analyst\n\nJim Huber – contributor\n\nBob Lorenz – fill in host\n\nTracy McGrady - fill-in analyst\n\nKevin McHale – analyst\n\nGary Payton – analyst\n\nSteve Kerr - analyst\n\nReggie Theus – analyst\n\nPeter Vecsey – analyst\n\nCheryl Miller – interviewer\n\nDavid Aldridge – contributor\n\nCasey Stern - fill-in host\n\nChris Webber - fill-in analyst\n\nTheme music[]\n\nThe current theme song, composed by former guitarist of the progressive rock band Yes, Trevor Rabin has been used since the 2002-2003 season."
