        "text": "The NBA playoffs continue on Sunday as the No. 2 seed Denver Nuggets host the No. 3 Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nThe Timberwolves smashed the Nuggets, 115-70, on Thursday to extend the series and force Game 7. Their 45-point margin of victory is the largest in franchise history and the largest in the postseason since 2016 (54 points, Chicago).\n\nAnthony Edwards produced a game-high 27 points, while Jaden McDaniels had 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 10 points, 13 rebounds and five assists to lead the Timberwolves to their second Game 7 in franchise history.\n\nThe loss by the Nuggets in Game 6 was the largest by a defending champion in history. They were held to 14 points in the first quarter and nine in the fourth quarter, tied for the fewest points scored in a quarter in franchise history.\n\nMost Valuable Player Nikola JokiÄ‡ led the Nuggets with 22 points and nine rebounds, and Aaron Gordon had 12 points, eight rebounds and four assists. The team finished with 26 field goals, the second-fewest allowed by the Timberwolves in the playoffs.\n\nThe Timberwolves will be looking to win their first Game 7 and advance to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2004 and just the second time in franchise history."
