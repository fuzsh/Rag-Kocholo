        "text": "The Clippers are finalizing an agreement with the NBA to host the 2026 All-Star Weekend at the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood. The Athletic was the first to report the plans.\n\nClippers owner Steve Ballmer, who privately financed the $1.8 billion arena located near SoFi Stadium, will meet with reporters on Tuesday. He is expected to be accompanied by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who will announce the site of the 2026 game.\n\nThe 17,700-seat Intuit Dome is scheduled to open in August, ahead of the 2024-25 season.\n\nLos Angeles last hosted NBA All-Star Weekend in 2018 at Crypto.com Arena, which was then known as Staples Center. L.A. has hosted the midseason event six times (1963, 1972, 1983, 2004, 2011, 2018), more than any city in the league.\n\nAccording to an ESPN report, the Kia Forum, which is also owned by Ballmer, will play some role in the All-Star Weekend festivities for the first time since it hosted the 1983 game.\n\nThe 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend will be held next month in Indianapolis, followed by the 2025 All-Star Weekend in San Francisco."
