        "text": "Olympic Men’s Basketball is down to four teams. Tomorrow, France takes on Germany before the United States plays Serbia. Considering the beating that Team USA put on Brazil, it appears as though the Americans are poised to push through toward the gold medal.\n\nAnd as an American, I like to root for my fellow countrymen.\n\nBut my favorite player on my favorite team, and the man who is going to be at the head of future championships is on one of the opposing teams. That man is Victor Wembanyama.\n\nIt is a bit of a conundrum.\n\nEver since the Olympics altered the amateur rule and the “Dream Team” suited up, the United States have swept the Olympics earning a gold medal in each and every competition...save one.\n\nIn 2004, I was rooting for Team USA. But, the blow of their loss was softened by the consolation that the gold went to Argentina. The head of their snake was San Antonio Spurs heart and soul Manu Ginobili.\n\nAnd twenty years later, I revel in the fact that one of my favorite all-time players won NBA titles with the Silver & Black, but I love that his list of accolades includes a gold medal celebrating his pride for his homeland.\n\nTwenty years form now, when looking back on the career of Victor Wembanyama, won’t it be great to see all of the NBA accolades paired with an Olympic gold medal?\n\nThis isn’t Wemby’s last rodeo. He’s sure to be back in the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles. But on his native soil, at the start of what promises to be a remarkable career, it would sure be something to see that 7’4” frame raised even higher on the podium, taking gold for France.\n\nWelcome to the Thread. Join in the conversation, start your own discussion, and share your thoughts. This is the Spurs community, your Spurs community. Thanks for being here."
