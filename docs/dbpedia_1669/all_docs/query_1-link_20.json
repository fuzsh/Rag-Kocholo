        "text": "The Minnesota Timberwolves are off to the Western Conference semifinals after a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe Timberwolves finished the regular season with a 56-24 record, their most wins since the 2003-04 season. It also marked Minnesota's third straight appearance in the playoffs, the first time since 2004. The Timberwolves series against the Denver Nuggets tips off Saturday.\n\nAnthony Edwards led Minnesota by averaging 31.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists against the Suns.\n\nEdwards had 40 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists in the series clinching Game 4 win against Phoenix. He became the second player with 40 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a series clinching win at age 22 or younger, the other being Magic Johnson in the 1980 NBA Finals, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nMinnesota's series win came almost 20 years to the day of its previous playoff clinching victory -- April 30, 2004. Here's a look back at what the world looked like the last time the Timberwolves advanced in the postseason.\n\nMinnesota's wolves are pups\n\nThere are a handful of squad members that may be too young to remember the franchise's last playoff series victory.\n\nEdwards was months away from turning 3 years old, while Karl-Anthony Towns was 8. Jaden McDaniels, one of the Timberwolves top young pieces, was 3 years old. The oldest player on the Timberwolves, Mike Conley, was in his sophomore year of high school.\n\nFor context, Conley's age at the time -- 16 years old -- is just two years younger than the combined age of four of Minnesota's top five scorers in the postseason: Edwards (2), Towns (8), McDaniels (3) and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (5).\n\nUsher owns the Billboard Hot 100\n\nTen years before his halftime performance at Super Bowl LVIII, R&B singer Usher had two of his tracks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. \"Yeah!\" featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris slotted in at No. 1, while \"Burn\" was at No. 4.\n\n\"Yeah!\" spent 47 weeks on the chart, including 12 at No. 1, Usher's longest track to be at the top. It won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and was nominated for Record of the Year. \"Burn\" spent 30 weeks on the chart, eight of which were at No. 1, and was nominated for two Grammys -- Best R&B Song and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.\n\n\"Mean Girls\" hits the box office\n\nOne of the more iconic movies of the 2000s released the same day the Timberwolves moved on to the second round. \"Mean Girls\" grossed $24.4 million domestically in its opening weekend and $86 million during its entire run. The movie was revamped for a release in January 2024.\n\nThe original film took home three MTV Movie Awards -- Best Female Performer (Lindsay Lohan), Best On Screen Team and Breakthrough Female (Rachel McAdams).\n\nNew England Patriots win first of back-to-back Super Bowls\n\nThe Patriots dynasty began to brew in early 2004. They defeated the Carolina Panthers 32-29 in Super Bowl XXXVIII, their second championship in three years and first of two straight.\n\nTom Brady threw for 354 passing yards and three touchdowns, while Deion Branch had a game-high 10 receptions for 143 receiving yards and a touchdown. Jake Delhomme had 323 passing yards and three touchdowns for Carolina, both postseason career highs.\n\nA record at the time, Super Bowl XXXVIII saw 144.4 million viewers tune in.\n\nFacebook is just over 1 month old\n\nMark Zuckerberg launched Facebook on Feb. 4 while a sophomore at Harvard.\n\nOriginally called The Facebook, it had 1 million users by the end of the year, prompting Zuckerberg to drop out of school. Facebook is now one of the most used social media sites in the world, with approximately 3 billion users."
