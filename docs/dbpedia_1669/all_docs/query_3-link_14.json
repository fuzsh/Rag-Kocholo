        "text": "Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news.\n\nFrom Chuck Schilken: Charles Barkley is getting his LinkedIn profile ready — and has been for a while now.\n\nAmid ongoing reports that his network might lose the rights to broadcast NBA games starting in the 2025-26 season, the TNT basketball analyst joked about possibly having to use the employment-focused social media platform, with the implication that he and his “Inside the NBA” co-hosts could soon be out of a job, during a May 19 broadcast of the show.\n\nMore than two weeks later, Barkley made a similar comment Tuesday on the “Beadle & Decker” Sirius XM radio show Tuesday.\n\n“I’m getting my LinkedIn profile together, so I might call y’all,” Barkley told co-hosts Michelle Beadle and Cody Decker. “I might put you all on my resume. Is that cool?”\n\n“Might” was the operative word, since an official announcement still hasn’t been made about what will happen with the league’s broadcasting rights when the current deal with TNT parent company Warner Bros. Discovery and ESPN parent Disney ends after next season.\n\n“That’s the one thing that really, really bothered me the most about the TNT experience,” said Barkley, who hosts “Inside the NBA” with Shaquille O’Neal, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith. “Like, hey man, just tell us something. ‘Cause, you know, everybody’s got an article coming out every day about we still got a chance or we’ve lost it. I’m like, yeah man, you guys see us every week. How ‘bout picking up the phone, saying ‘Hey, we still negotiating’ or ‘you know what, we’ve lost it.’\n\n“Just truth us. Cause the one thing that really sucks, we gotta do this next year no matter what.”\n\nContinue reading here\n\nCeltics stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown make most of second chance in NBA Finals\n\nKyrie Irving put distractions behind him, focused on leading Mavericks to NBA Finals\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks’ Luka Doncic realizes childhood dream of playing in NBA Finals\n\nDODGERS\n\nFrom Jack Harris: This week’s pitching matchups should have favored the Dodgers’ powerhouse lineup.\n\nIn their first two games against the Pittsburgh Pirates this week, the Dodgers faced a pair of rookie right-handers in Jared Jones and Paul Skenes. Both prospects are talented (and from L.A. area high schools La Mirada and El Toro, respectively). Skenes, in particular, looks destined for stardom, already thriving in the big leagues less than a year after being drafted No. 1 overall.\n\nStill, for the Dodgers’ star-studded offense and $300-million roster, a pair of unproven rookies figured to be manageable marks. After a couple of inconsistent weeks at the plate, it seemed like the time for the team’s bats to break back out.\n\nThere was only one problem.\n\nLike an ever-growing number of MLB pitchers, Skenes and Jones both throw their fastballs hard. As in, near triple-digit hard.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nDodgers box score\n\nMLB scores\n\nMLB standings\n\nANGELS\n\nNolan Schanuel and Zach Neto homered as the Angels finished off a three-game sweep of San Diego with a 3-2 victory Wednesday night after Padres star Manny Machado injured a leg.\n\nMachado appeared to hurt his upper right leg after running out an attempted double-play ball during the fourth inning. He was looked at by a trainer before walking gingerly back to the first-base dugout.\n\nIt was the first time since last July against the Yankees that the Angels swept a three-game series at home. Coming into the series, the Angels had dropped 21 of 28 games at the Big A, easily the worst home start in franchise history.\n\nJosé Soriano (3-5) had his fifth straight start in which he went at least six innings and gave up two runs (one earned) and six hits with one strikeout.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nAngels box score\n\nMLB scores\n\nMLB standings\n\nNBA PLAYOFFS SCHEDULE\n\nAll times Pacific\n\nNBA Finals\n\nThursday at Boston, 5:30 p.m., ABC\n\nSunday at Boston, 5 p.m., ABC\n\nWed., June 12 at Dallas, 5:30 p.m., ABC\n\nFriday, June 14 at Dallas, 5:30 p.m., ABC\n\n*Monday, June 17 at Boston, 5:30 p.m., ABC\n\n*Thursday, June 20 at Dallas, 5:30 p.m., ABC\n\n*Sunday, June 23, at Boston, 5 p.m., ABC\n\n*-if necessary\n\nSPARKS\n\nFrom Marissa Kraus: Offensive struggles and a 25-point clinic by Napheesa Collier helped Minnesota beat the Sparks 86-62 on Wednesday.\n\nCollier made 10 of 15 from the field, 4 of 5 from the free-throw line and added two steals while Kayla McBride recorded 13 points, three rebounds and three assists. The game was altered by foul trouble for the Sparks and Lynx, who put up 20 and 18, respectively.\n\nDearica Hamby led the Sparks with 17 points and 11 rebounds for her fifth double-double of the season. Layshia Clarendon, who returned from a concussion-triggered absence, added seven points, four rebounds and a pair of steals.\n\nAfter an 11-0 run by Minnesota to open the contest, the Sparks couldn’t catch up, letting the Lynx build a 20-point lead in the second quarter. Minnesota led 45-26 at the half and maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the game.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nSparks box score\n\nWNBA standings\n\nL.A. OLYMPICS\n\nFrom David Wharton: The organizers of the 2028 Summer Olympics have reached far outside the sports world for their new chief executive, hiring a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general who served in the White House and as chief of staff for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nReynold Hoover arrives at a crucial juncture for LA28, which will also stage the Paralympics.

Foyt, Jim Clark, Dan Gurney and Richard Petty. Indeed, Jones raced against — and beat — all of them at some point in his career.\n\nAnd a busy career it was, for Jones liked to drive anything that could be raced.
