        "text": "Professional basketball tournament\n\nThe 2024 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2023–24 season. The playoffs began on April 20 and concluded on June 17 with the Boston Celtics winning the 2024 NBA Finals for their 18th championship, the most in NBA history.\n\nThe Boston Celtics entered the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season, the longest present streak in the NBA. They also won the Maurice Podoloff Trophy for clinching the best record in the NBA for the first time since 2008.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder entered the playoffs for the first time since 2020 and also clinched the number one seed in the Western Conference for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks entered the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers entered the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets entered the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.\n\nThe Miami Heat entered the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns entered the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves entered the playoffs for the third consecutive season.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers, New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Los Angeles Lakers entered the playoffs for the second consecutive season.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks and New Orleans Pelicans returned to the playoffs after missing the postseason the previous year.\n\nThe Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers entered the playoffs for the first time since 2020.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings missed the playoffs after making the postseason the previous year.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors missed the playoffs for the first time since 2021.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies and Atlanta Hawks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2020.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season, currently the longest active playoff drought in the NBA.\n\nThis was the first playoffs to not feature Chris Paul since 2010.[1]\n\nWith an average age of 23.9 years old, the Oklahoma City Thunder became the youngest team to earn the 1-seed in NBA history.[2]\n\nThe Thunder also became the seventh different Western Conference 1-seed in the last seven years, the longest stretch in the West since the 16-team format began in 1984.[3]\n\nThe Boston Celtics finished first in the Eastern Conference standings by 14 games, which was the largest margin between No. 1 and No. 2 in either conference since 1976.[4]\n\nAll home teams in the first-round matchups won game 1 for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe Knicks' game 2 comeback against the 76ers marked just the fourth time in the play-by-play era (dating to the 1996–97 season) that a team won a playoff game after trailing by at least five points in the last 30 seconds.[5] The Knicks were also the first team to win in regulation, as the other three teams completed their comeback in overtime.[6]\n\nThe Miami Heat's 23 three-pointers made in game 2 against the Celtics were the most ever by a team in a road playoff win in NBA history. This was also the Heat's franchise record for most threes made in a single playoff game.[7][8]\n\nIn game 3 against the Knicks, Joel Embiid became the first player in NBA history to score 50 points on fewer than 20 shots in a playoff game.[9]\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns, marking the 48th year in a row that a sweep occurred. The last time a sweep did not occur was in 1976. This was the 184th series sweep in NBA playoffs history.\n\nThe series also marked the Timberwolves' first playoff series win since 2004 and the first sweep of a best-of-7 series in Minnesota men's professional sports history.[10]\n\nKevin Durant was swept in a playoff series for the second time in his career, with both instances occurring in the first round.[11]\n\nFor the first time in playoff history, there were four 40+ point scorers on the same day, as Devin Booker, Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, and Kyrie Irving all scored 40+ points on April 28.[12]\n\nJamal Murray became the fourth player in NBA history to hit two go-ahead shots inside the final five seconds in the same postseason, and the only player to do so in the same series.[13]\n\nThis marked just the second time LeBron James was eliminated in the first round, with his only previous first round elimination coming against the Suns in 2021.[14]\n\nThe 76ers became the first team in the play-by-play era (since 1996–97) to win a playoff game when trailing by at least six points in the final 25 seconds of regulation.[15]\n\nThe Bucks became the first team in NBA history to win a playoff game without playing their top two leading scorers from the regular season (Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard).[15]\n\nThe Celtics became the first team in postseason history to score 100+ points and hold their opponents to under 90 points in three straight playoff games.[16]\n\nThe Pacers' elimination of the Bucks marked their first playoff series win since 2014.\n\nJalen Brunson became the third player in NBA history with four consecutive playoff games of 35+ points and 5+ assists in a single postseason, joining LeBron James and Michael Jordan.[17]\n\nThe Cavaliers–Magic series was the first of the 2024 playoffs to have a game 7, making it the 25th consecutive NBA postseason to feature a game 7. The last time a game 7 did not occur in the playoffs was 1999. This was the 151st game 7 in NBA playoffs history.\n\nDonovan Mitchell scored 52.1% of the Cavaliers' points in game 6, the most by a player with an opportunity to clinch a playoff series in NBA history.[18]\n\nMitchell recorded his third 50-point playoff game, tying Allen Iverson for the third-most 50+ point games in playoff history, trailing only Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan.[19]\n\nThe Cavaliers won a playoff series without LeBron James for the first time since 1993.\n\nThis was the first conference semifinals without LeBron James, Kevin Durant, or Stephen Curry since 2005.[14]\n\nThis was the first Western Conference semifinals without a team from California since 2005.\n\nAnthony Edwards joined Kobe Bryant as the only players aged 22 or younger to have consecutive 40-point playoff games.[20]\n\nJalen Brunson became the first player in NBA history to record 40+ points and 5+ assists in four straight playoff games.[21]\n\nThe Cavaliers' 24-point win over the Celtics in game 2 was the biggest in the playoffs by a double-digit underdog since 1991.[22]\n\nThis was the third straight year in which there were no series sweeps in the conference semifinals.\n\nJayson Tatum became the second player since 1973 to lead both teams in a playoff series in total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks after LeBron James did so in the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\nKyrie Irving extended his win-loss record in close-out NBA playoffs games to 14–0.[23] This streak would end on May 28 however, when Dallas lost game 4 of the Western Conference Finals against the Timberwolves.[24]\n\nThe Timberwolves’ 45-point lead in game 6 against the Nuggets was the largest margin of victory against a defending champion in NBA playoff history.[25] It was also the second largest margin of victory in playoff history by a team facing elimination, surpassed only by the Minneapolis Lakers' 58-point victory over the St. Louis Hawks in the 1956 NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe Pacers set an NBA playoff record for shooting percentage, making 67.1% of their shots in game 7 against the Knicks.[26]\n\nThe Pacers also set the highest shooting percentage rate in a half with 76.3%, making 29 out of 38 shots in the first half. This was also the highest rate in the postseason for 25 years since 1997, when the NBA began keeping detailed play-by-play for all four quarters.[27]\n\nAged 20 years and 96 days old, Dereck Lively II became the youngest player in NBA history to record 10+ points and 15+ rebounds in a playoff game, coming during game 6 of the Maverick's Western Conference Semifinal win against the Thunder on May 18.[28]\n\nThe Timberwolves overcame a 20–point deficit to win game 7 against the Nuggets, the largest game 7 comeback in NBA playoffs history.[29]\n\nWith the defending champion Nuggets losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves, the 2024 playoffs marked the fifth straight year where the defending champion was eliminated before the conference finals.\n\nThe Nuggets' elimination also confirmed there would be unique NBA champions across a six-year span for the first time since 1975–1980.\n\nThis marked the first time that two road teams won a game 7 on the same day.\n\nNeither the first-seeded team nor the second-seeded team made the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2022.\n\nThe Celtics entered the Eastern Conference finals for the third straight playoffs.\n\nThis was the first Eastern Conference finals to feature either the Boston Celtics or the Miami Heat, but not both, since 2018.\n\nThe Mavericks returned to the Western Conference finals after missing the previous playoffs.[23]\n\nThe Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2014.[27]\n\nThe Timberwolves advanced to the Western Conference finals for just the second time in team history, and the first time since 2004.[29]\n\nThe average age of the leading scorer for each team remaining (Tatum, Haliburton, Edwards, and Dončić for the Celtics, Pacers, Timberwolves, and Mavericks respectively) was 24.62, the youngest in a conference finals since 1971.[30]\n\nGame 1 vs the Pacers was the first time in Celtics' franchise history that three of its players (Tatum, Brown, and Holiday) scored 25 or more points in a Conference Finals game.[31]\n\nDereck Lively II became the first player in NBA history to record a perfect 16/16 (100 percent) from the field in a playoff series.[32] He surpassed Chris Andersen 's previous record of 13/13 FG made at 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals series.[33]\n\nThis was the third instance (following the 2015 and 2023 playoffs) where both conference finals series had teams go up 3–0 in the series. Just like in 2015, the Celtics would go on to complete the sweep in the East, while the Timberwolves would successfully force a game 5 in the West but fell short.\n\nThis was also the second time that the Indiana Pacers and the Minnesota Timberwolves were runner-ups in their respective conference finals, the last occurrence being in 2004.\n\nThis was the first time the Dallas Mavericks played a team other than the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, having lost to Miami in 2006 and won against them in 2011.\n\nThe Mavericks became the second #5 seed in NBA history to make the finals, joining the 2019–20 Miami Heat.\n\nLuka Dončić became the first player to lead all players in points, rebounds and assists entering the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks' 38-point lead over the Boston Celtics (122–84) in game 4 of the Finals was the third largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.[34]\n\nTim Hardaway Jr. joined Ray Allen and Stephen Curry as the only three players to score five or more three-pointers in a single quarter of an NBA Finals game.[35]\n\nSee also: NBA playoffs § Format\n\nEight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.\n\nThe NBA Board of Governors adopted a format starting in 2021 to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.[36]\n\nEach conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding. All rounds were a best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home-court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). For the NBA Finals, home-court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Boston Celtics became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[37] While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.[38]\n\nSeeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 16–19.\n\nSeed Team Record Clinched Play-in berth Playoff berth Division title Best record\n\nin conference Best record\n\nin NBA 1 Boston Celtics 64–18 — March 14[37] March 20[39] March 24[40] April 3[41] 2 New York Knicks 50–32 — April 10[42] — — — 3 Milwaukee Bucks 49–33 — April 7[43] April 14[44] — — 4 Cleveland Cavaliers 48–34 — April 12[45] — — — 5 Orlando Magic 47–35 — April 14[46] April 14[46] — — 6 Indiana Pacers 47–35 — April 14[47] — — — 7 Philadelphia 76ers 47–35 April 14[47] April 17[48] — — — 8 Miami Heat 46–36 April 14[47] April 19[49] — — —\n\nChicago (39–43) and Atlanta (36–46) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.[49][50]\n\nSeed Team Record Clinched Play-in berth Playoff berth Division title Best record\n\nin conference Best record\n\nin NBA 1 Oklahoma City Thunder 57–25 — March 31[51] April 14[47] April 14[47] — 2 Denver Nuggets 57–25 — March 31[52] — — — 3 Minnesota Timberwolves 56–26 — April 1[53] — — — 4 Los Angeles Clippers 51–31 — April 9[54] April 9[54] — — 5 Dallas Mavericks 50–32 — April 9[54] April 10[55] — — 6 Phoenix Suns 49–33 — April 14[47] — — — 7 Los Angeles Lakers 47–35 April 10[56] April 16[57] — — — 8 New Orleans Pelicans 49–33 April 14[47] April 19[49] — — —\n\nSacramento (46–36) and Golden State (46–36) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.[49][58]\n\nFurther information: NBA play-in tournament § 2024\n\nBold Game winner\n\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nBold Game winner\n\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

Tatum's performance of 23 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists was complemented by his teammates, as they knocked down 21 of Boston's 22 three-pointers. Derrick White added 20 points and four assists for Boston, which finished with six players in double-figures. The Heat, who were without Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier, never held a lead and trailed by as much as 34 points. Bam Adebayo had a game-high 24 points, while Delon Wright and Jaime Jaquez Jr. finished with 17 and 16 points respectively, with Wright going 5-for-5 from beyond the arc.\n\nWithout Jimmy Butler, the Heat hit a franchise playoff-record 23 three-pointers as Miami tied the series at one game apiece. Tyler Herro had 24 points and 14 assists, hitting 6-of-11 from beyond the arc, while Bam Adebayo finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds on 69% shooting. Caleb Martin also had 21 points and five threes for the Heat, who shot 53.5% (23-of-43) from beyond the arc to bounce back after a game 1 blowout. Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for the Celtics, who lost just their fifth home game of the season, while Jayson Tatum scored 28. Boston newcomers Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis combined for 15 points and shot 5-of-21 from the field, with Porziņģis finishing with a plus–minus of –32 in a 10-point loss.\n\nThe top-seeded Celtics responded emphatically to their home loss with a wire-to-wire 104–84 victory over the Heat, retaking the series lead. Led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown's 22 points each, the Celtics improved upon their defense and held Miami to a season-low 84 points. Tatum also contributed 11 rebounds and six assists, while Kristaps Porziņģis and Derrick White added 18 and 16 points respectively. The Heat, who trailed by as much as 29, struggled to find an offensive rhythm, with Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro combining on 13-of-34 (38%) from the field. With the win, the Celtics improved to 15–4 immediately following a loss this season and improved to 6–1 in their last seven road playoff games against Miami.\n\nDerrick White scored a career-high 38 points to move the Celtics to the brink of the second round. White shot 15-of-26 from the field and 8-of-15 from beyond the arc for Boston, who are 28–0 all-time in playoff series after taking a 3–1 lead. Jayson Tatum contributed 20 points and 11 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown added 17 points. Despite the win, the Celtics lost Kristaps Porziņģis in the first half to a calf injury. For the Heat, Bam Adebayo recorded a double-double with 25 points and 17 rebounds, while Tyler Herro recorded 19 points and five turnovers. Despite a 4-of-8 three-point shooting night from Caleb Martin, the rest of the Heat shot 5-of-25 from deep, as they managed under 90 points for the second consecutive game.\n\nThe Celtics dominated the game from start to finish, winning every quarter and blowing out the Heat for a 4–1 series win. Derrick White scored 25 points, including 5 3-pointers. Jaylen Brown also contributed 25 points, while Jayson Tatum completed a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Sam Hauser came off the bench and shot 5-of-8 from beyond the arc en route to 17 points. The Heat endured a hard time on the offensive end, making just 3 3-pointers in 29 attempts, along with an overall field goal percentage of 41.4%, as they were limited to below 90 points for the third straight game. Bam Adebayo led the scoring for them, notching 23 points in the losing effort.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Heat winning four of the first six meetings.[59]\n\nPrevious playoff series\n\nWith the Knicks' starters struggling, the New York bench outscored the 76ers' bench 42–7, with Miles McBride, Bojan Bogdanović and Mitchell Robinson leading the way to win Game 1. McBride scored 21 points and outscored Philadelphia 13–12 in the second quarter, as he brought the Knicks out of an early 13-point deficit. Josh Hart recorded a double-double and hit multiple three-pointers late in the fourth quarter, while Jalen Brunson had seven rebounds and seven assists. A hobbled Joel Embiid scored 29 points, alongside eight rebounds and six assists, while Tyrese Maxey had a game-high 33 points. Despite a higher field goal percentage, the Sixers were outrebounded, as they conceded 23 offensive rebounds to New York.\n\nIn a dramatic turnaround, the Knicks overcame a five-point deficit in the final 30 seconds to win 104–101 and take a 2–0 series lead. After Kyle Lowry missed his second free throw, Jalen Brunson, who was previously 7-for-28 from the field and 0-of-5 from beyond the arc, hit a three-pointer that bounced on the rim and dropped in. Following the inbound to Tyrese Maxey, Josh Hart stole the ball and kicked it out to Donte DiVincenzo, who missed a three-pointer, but an offensive rebound by Isaiah Hartenstein found the ball back in DiVincenzo's hands, who drained a go-ahead three with 13 seconds left. Maxey then missed a driving layup, New York made two free throws, and the Knicks secured the victory after Joel Embiid's three-point attempt missed at the buzzer. Maxey, battling flu-like symptoms, tallied 35 points, 10 assists, and nine rebounds, while Embiid finished with 34 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAfter vowing the 76ers were “going to win this series”, Joel Embiid scored a playoff career-high 50 points, with 18 of them coming in a decisive third quarter to win 125–114. Embiid, who's been battling Bell's palsy, was 13-of-19 from the floor, made 19-of-21 free throws, and hit five three-pointers, with four of them coming during Philadelphia's 43–27 third quarter. Tyrese Maxey finished with 25 points, and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 15 points on 75% shooting. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 13 assists on an improved 48% from the field, while Josh Hart and OG Anunoby recorded 20 and 17 points, respectively. Mitchell Robinson also had seven rebounds before getting injured following a controversial flagrant foul from Embiid.\n\nJalen Brunson scored 47 points, setting a Knicks franchise playoff record en route to securing a commanding 3–1 series lead back to New York. Brunson shot 18-of-34 from the field and finished with an assist-turnover ratio of 10 to 1, as he surpassed the 46 points scored by Bernard King in 1984. Josh Hart had zero field goals but finished with a playoff career-high 17 rebounds, while OG Anunoby had a double-double of 16 points and 14 boards. Joel Embiid had 27 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists, but shot 0-of-5 from the field in the fourth quarter and finished the game 7-of-19. Tyrese Maxey scored 23 and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 19 points as the Sixers shot 29-of-82 (35%) from the floor, their second-lowest percentage of the season.\n\nTrailing by six with under 30 seconds and facing elimination, Tyrese Maxey converted a four-point play and hit a 35-foot game-tying three to force overtime and save the 76ers' season. Maxey finished with a playoff career-high 46 points and nine assists on 57% shooting, while Joel Embiid, who shot 7-of-19 from the field and committed nine turnovers, recorded his first playoff triple-double. Jalen Brunson had his second straight 40-point game and scored all nine of the Knicks' overtime points, but committed a crucial turnover in the waning seconds. Tobias Harris had 19 points and Kelly Oubre scored the go-ahead layup in overtime for Philadelphia, while Josh Hart and OG Anunoby tallied 18 and 17 points, respectively, for New York.\n\nWith the game tied at 111-111 with 26 seconds left in the fourth quarter, a wide open Josh Hart made a go-ahead three-pointer to put New York on top as they eliminated the 76ers 4-2. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 41 points and 12 assists on 13-of-27 shots alongside 12-of-16 free throws, his third-straight 40-point game. Hart had a double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds, while Donte DiVincenzo added 23 points for New York. For Philadelphia, Joel Embiid recorded 39 points and 13 rebounds on 12-of-25 shots, although he committed five turnovers and fouled out in the final seconds of the game. Tyrese Maxey had 17 points on 6-of-18 shots, while Tobias Harris failed to score in 29 minutes of play. Off the bench, Buddy Hield added 20 points for Philadelphia, but he overshot a potential game-tying three-pointer at the end of the game.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the tenth playoff meeting between these two teams, and the fifth since the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia in 1963, with the 76ers winning six of the first nine meetings.[60]\n\nPrevious playoff series Philadelphia leads 6–3 in all-time playoff series\n\nIn his first playoff game in three years, Damian Lillard scored all 35 of his points in the first half to give the Bucks a 27-point halftime lead and ultimately secure a 1–0 series advantage without Giannis Antetokounmpo. Khris Middleton also had 23 points and 10 rebounds on 64% shooting for the Bucks, while Bobby Portis added 15 points and 11 rebounds. The Pacers, who averaged a league-high 123.3 points per game, finished with a season-low 94 points and shot 8-of-38 (21%) from three-point range. Pascal Siakam finished with a game-high 36 points and 13 rebounds on 60% shooting, center Myles Turner shot 5-for-17 from the field for 17 points and eight rebounds, while Tyrese Haliburton finished with nine points and eight assists in his playoff debut.\n\nAfter a tightly contested first three quarters, the Pacers used a 23–4 run in the fourth quarter to even the series at 1–1. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with a game-high 37 points on 69.5% from the field, along with 11 rebounds. Myles Turner and Andrew Nembhard scored 22 and 20 points respectively, as the Pacers shot 55.6% in game 2 compared to 39.6% in game 1. Tyrese Haliburton also provided 12 assists for Indiana, who snapped a 10-game playoff losing streak that dated back to 2018. Damian Lillard scored 26 by halftime for the Bucks but finished with 34, continuing his second-half struggles with just eight points in two games this series. Brook Lopez scored 22 on 6-of-7 from deep, while Bobby Portis had a double-double.\n\nTyrese Haliburton's game-winning three-point play in the final seconds of overtime gave the Pacers their first back-to-back postseason wins since 2014. Despite shooting 8-of-22 from the field and 1-of-12 from beyond the arc, Haliburton showcased his resiliency and recorded his first playoff triple-double with 18 points, 16 assists, and 10 rebounds in Indiana's first home playoff win in six years. Pascal Siakam had 17 points and nine rebounds, while Myles Turner's playoff career-high 29 points and nine rebounds also bolstered the Pacers' effort, as they led by as much as 19 in the first quarter. Damian Lillard was hampered by injuries, finishing with 28 points on 6-of-20 from the field, while Khris Middleton stepped up for the Bucks with a playoff career-high 42 points, including a three-pointer that sent the game to overtime. Bobby Portis also had 17 points and 18 rebounds for Milwaukee.\n\nAlready without Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks also entered game four without Damian Lillard, who injured his achilles in game three. Moreover, early in the first quarter, Bobby Portis was ejected after a scuffle with Andrew Nembhard. Without three key players, Milwaukee kept the game close only trailing 67–64 by halftime. However, during the third quarter, Indiana built a 17 point lead and never looked back, taking a 3–1 series lead. Myles Turner again recorded 29 points and nine rebounds, shooting 7–9 from three, while Tyrese Haliburton added 24 points in the win. For Milwaukee, Brook Lopez finished with 27 points and nine rebounds while Khris Middleton added 25 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nAgain, Milwaukee entered game five without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, looking to extend their season.

Milwaukee carried this momentum throughout the rest of the game, cutting Indiana's series lead 3–2 behind Khris Middleton's 29 points and 12 rebounds, as well as Bobby Portis' 29 points and 10 rebounds. Tyrese Haliburton led the Pacers with 16 points and six assists, while Myles Turner and Pascal Siakam were held to 13 and 12 points respectively.\n\nDespite being injured the past two games, Damian Lillard suited up for the Bucks hoping to extend the series to game seven.

Paolo Banchero scored 21 points for the Magic, while Franz Wagner contributed 17 of his 18 points in the first half, as the duo combined for 12 turnovers. Just like in game 1, Orlando shot a dismal 36% from the field and 9-of-35 from beyond the arc as the Magic failed to score over 90 points for the second consecutive game.\n\nAfter never trailing in the first two games of the series, the Cavaliers were handed the worst loss in their postseason history as the Magic won 121–83. Led by Paolo Banchero's 31 points and 14 rebounds, alongside Jalen Suggs' contribution of 24 points on 9-of-11 shooting, the Magic won their first home playoff game since 2011. Franz Wagner added 16 points and eight assists to the Magic's tally, as he and Banchero combined for zero turnovers. On the defensive end, they limited the Cavaliers to just 39% shooting from the field and 23.5% from deep. Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert led Cleveland in scoring with 15 points, while the starting backcourt of Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland combined for 18 points on 8-of-26 from the field.\n\nTrailing by nine at halftime, the Magic opened the second half on a 41–10 run to even the series at two games apiece. With Paolo Banchero having a quiet night (nine points, five assists), Franz Wagner stepped up for Orlando, tallying 34 points and 13 rebounds on 13-of-17 shooting, as he outscored the Cavaliers by himself in the third quarter. After putting up 60 points in the first half, Cleveland struggled mightily in the second half, scoring just 29 points and enduring a scoreless drought that lasted almost seven minutes. Jarrett Allen led the Cavaliers with 21 points and nine rebounds, while Donovan Mitchell scored 18 points in the first half. However, Mitchell failed to score after halftime, going 0-of-4 from the field with four turnovers.\n\nIn a pivotal game 5, the Cavaliers edged past the Magic 104–103, with Evan Mobley blocking Franz Wagner's layup in the final seconds to secure the victory. After the first four games had a combined eight lead changes, game 5 featured 17 lead changes. Without Jarrett Allen, Mobley filled his shoes in his absence, providing 14 points and 13 rebounds on 7-of-11 shooting, while Donovan Mitchell led Cleveland in scoring with 28 points, and Darius Garland had 17 of his 23 points in the first quarter. In his fifth career playoff game, 21-year-old Paolo Banchero scored 16 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter and finished 14-of-24 from the field for the Magic, who lost their seventh consecutive road game dating back to the regular season.\n\nThe Magic overcame a 50-point performance by Donovan Mitchell to defeat the Cavaliers 103–96 and force a game 7 back in Cleveland.

Meanwhile for Cleveland, Darius Garland scored 21 points on 59% shooting, Evan Mobley had five blocks, and Mitchell shot 22-of-36 from the field and scored the Cavaliers' final 22 points, including all 18 in the fourth. Although Cleveland had a significantly higher field goal percentage, they were outrebounded and shot 7-of-28 from deep, as center Jarrett Allen missed his second straight game.\n\nThe Cavaliers overcame an 18-point first-half deficit and advanced to the conference semifinals for the first time in six years, and the first time without LeBron James on their roster since 1993. Trailing 49–31 midway through the second quarter, Cleveland rallied behind Donovan Mitchell, who finished with 39 points and nine rebounds on 41% from the field. Down by ten at halftime, the Cavaliers held the Magic to just 4-of-24 from the field in the third quarter, as Mitchell outscored them 17–15 in the period. Darius Garland scored 10 of his 12 points in the final quarter, Caris LeVert scored 15 off the bench, and Evan Mobley tallied five blocks and 16 rebounds. Paolo Banchero's 38-point effort for Orlando, particularly his 24 points in the first half, wasn't enough as he struggled shooting 27% in the second half. His co-stars did not fare well either, as Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs combined to shoot 3-of-28 from the field.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Magic winning the first meeting.[62]\n\nPrevious playoff series Orlando leads 1–0 in all-time playoff series\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander's 28-point performance, including a go-ahead basket in the final minute, secured the Thunder's first home playoff win in five years.

Aaron Gordon secured a double-double while Michael Porter Jr. finished with 19 points and eight rebounds. On the Lakers' side, LeBron James scored 27 points and Anthony Davis added 32, as Los Angeles led for the majority of the first half.

The Lakers dominated the first half, cruising to a 59–44 lead at halftime. However, Denver, led by Nikola Jokić's 27-point, 20-rebound triple-double, fought their way back into the game. Michael Porter Jr. scored 22 points and made a game-tying three-pointer with 1:15 to go. LeBron James tried a wide-open three with the score at 99–99, but it rimmed out. The Nuggets secured the rebound, and Jamal Murray scored the game-winning fadeaway jump shot over Anthony Davis.

Murray led the way for the Nuggets with 32 points, 12 of which came in the fourth quarter. Nikola Jokić, although committing an uncharacteristic 7 turnovers, nonetheless finished the game with 25 points, 20 rebounds and 9 assists, narrowly missing out on his third triple-double of the series.

Karl-Anthony Towns chipped in with 19 points, Nickeil Alexander-Walker contributed 18 points and four steals off the bench, while Rudy Gobert anchored the defense with 14 points and 16 rebounds. Despite Kevin Durant's 31-point performance on 65% shooting for the Suns, alongside Bradley Beal's 15 points on 60% from the field, the Wolves outrebounded Phoenix 52–28 and outscored them in the paint 52–34. The Minnesota bench also outscored the Suns' reserves 41–18.\n\nJaden McDaniels led all scorers with a playoff career-high 25 points and spearheaded another stifling defensive performance by the Timberwolves to win 105–93. Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley both contributed 18 points while Phoenix was focused on containing Anthony Edwards, who shot 3-of-12 with 15 points and eight assists. Despite Phoenix's efforts to rally, Minnesota's 11–0 fourth-quarter run solidified their second-ever 2–0 playoff series lead. The Suns' \"big three\" of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal struggled, shooting a combined 18-for-45 (40%), while the Timberwolves capitalized on turnovers, scoring 31 points off 20 Phoenix errors compared to the Suns' two points from Minnesota's 14 turnovers.\n\nIn a dominant display, Anthony Edwards propelled the Timberwolves to the brink of their first playoff series win in 20 years.

For Phoenix, Devin Booker scored a playoff career-high 49 points on 62% from the field and 20-of-21 from the free throw line, while Kevin Durant scored 33 points on 12-of-17 shooting.

Meanwhile, the Clippers, who were missing Kawhi Leonard due to injury, limited Dallas to their fewest points in a playoff half, as they held them to 22% from the field and 2-of-18 from beyond the arc in the first half to secure a commanding 26-point halftime lead.\n\nLuka Dončić had 32 points and nine assists, Kyrie Irving scored 23, and P.

With Dončić struggling with his shooting efficiency, going 7-of-25 from the field and 3-of-14 from beyond the arc, his co-star Kyrie Irving poured 19 of his 21 points in the final 14 minutes of the game to keep the Clippers at bay. Despite a strong first half, James Harden's scoring output diminished in the second half for the Clippers, finishing with 21 points, while Norman Powell scored 21 off the bench. The Clippers' offense was hampered by 19 turnovers, and they also got little offensive support from Paul George and Russell Westbrook, as the pair combined for eight points on 3-of-18 shooting.\n\nThe Clippers squandered a 31-point lead but rallied to win, led by Paul George and James Harden, reclaiming home-court advantage. Without Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles jumped out to an early 55–24 lead as George scored 26 points of his 33 points in the first half. However, the Mavericks rallied behind Kyrie Irving, who had his first 40-point playoff game in seven years, as his layup gave Dallas the lead with 2:14 remaining. However, a step-back three by George and key floaters from Harden, who scored 15 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter, secured the victory. Luka Dončić recorded his fourth playoff triple-double, while the Clippers shot 62% from beyond the arc, with George and Harden hitting a combined 11-of-15 three-pointers.\n\nBattling a sprained knee and an illness, Luka Dončić led the Mavericks with 35 points, seven rebounds, and 10 assists as Dallas routed the Clippers by 30 points to take a 3–2 series lead.

Dončić finished with 13 assists but struggled with his shooting, going 9-of-26 from the field and missing nine of his 10 three-pointers, while Irving shot 10-of-13 from the field after halftime, as he improved to 13–0 in series-clinching games for his career. For the Clippers, Norman Powell had 20 points off the bench and Ivica Zubac recorded his third double-double of the series, while Paul George and James Harden continued to struggle, combining for 34 points on 32% (11-of-34) shooting.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Clippers winning the first two meetings.[67]\n\nPrevious playoff series LA Clippers lead 2–0 in all-time playoff series\n\n2021\n\nLos Angeles Clippers 4, Dallas Mavericks 3\n\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA.
