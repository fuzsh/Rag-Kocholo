        "text": "Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news.\n\nFrom Dan Woike: Old engines take longer to warm up.\n\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers’ veterans who carry the most responsibility and the heaviest burdens, weren’t good enough for the first 48 minutes.\n\nWell, the first 47 minutes and 59.2 seconds.\n\nWith 0.8 left in regulation, James hit a high-arching bank shot to force overtime, and with extra minutes to make the previous four quarters right, James and Davis took over, scoring the Lakers’ first nine points in a 117-111 overtime victory over the Grizzlies.\n\nJames punctuated things with a driving score to seal it in overtime, howling and flexing at the crowd with the win about to be in his grasp.\n\nThe Lakers now travel to Memphis for Game 5 on Wednesday night, where they’ll have a chance to end the series with a victory.\n\nJames finished with 22 points and 20 rebounds, a career high. It’s first postseason 20/20 game by a Laker since Shaquille O’Neal did it in the 2004 NBA Finals.\n\nMonday, a moment when the Lakers first-round series could swing in one direction or the other, had to mostly be played in staccato. There were too many fouls, too many whistles, too many missed shots and too many mistakes to provide the game with meaningful flow.\n\nThat meant the Lakers and the Grizzlies had to win moments, basketball at its most granular, each box out, each dribble, each decision vital to grabbing the minimal amounts of momentum that were available down the stretch.\n\nD’Angelo Russell provided one of those stretches, hitting three three-point shots in short order in the fourth to energize the nervous crowd. Austin Reaves had it at moments, as did Jarred Vanderbilt, Dennis Schroder and Troy Brown Jr.\n\nReaves even led the Lakers with 23 points as Davis could only scratch together 12.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nCLIPPERS\n\nFrom Andrew Greif: Clippers star Kawhi Leonard did not participate in practice Monday because he was receiving treatment on the sprained right knee that has sidelined him the last two games of the team’s first-round series against the Phoenix Suns, coach Tyronn Lue said.\n\nAsked whether receiving treatment left open the door for a return in Tuesday’s Game 5 in Phoenix, Lue said that “there’s always a possibility.”\n\nThe Clippers later listed Leonard as out for Game 5 on the evening injury report.\n\nPhoenix leads the seven-game series 3-1.\n\nIt was not until before Game 3 that the Clippers acknowledged Leonard had injured the knee in the series opener and aggravated it in Game 2. He has watched Clippers losses in the third and fourth games of the series from the sideline.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nNBA PLAYOFFS\n\nResults, schedule\n\nAll times Pacific\n\nWestern Conference\n\nNo. 2 Memphis vs. No. 7 Lakers\n\nGame 1: Lakers 128, at Memphis 112\n\nGame 2: at Memphis 103, Lakers 93\n\nGame 3: at Lakers 111, Memphis 101\n\nGame 4: at Lakers 117, Memphis 111 (OT)\n\nWednesday at Memphis, 4:30 p.m., TNT\n\n*Friday at Lakers, TBD\n\n*Sunday at Memphis, TBD\n\nNo. 4 Phoenix vs. No. 5 Clippers\n\nGame 1: Clippers 115, at Phoenix 110\n\nGame 2: at Phoenix 123, Clippers 109\n\nGame 3: Phoenix 129, at Clippers 124\n\nGame 4: Phoenix 112, at Clippers 100\n\nTonight at Phoenix, 7 p.m., TNT\n\n*Thursday at Clippers, TBD\n\n*Saturday at Phoenix, TBD\n\nNo. 1 Denver vs. No. 8 Minnesota\n\nGame 1: at Denver 109, Minnesota 80\n\nGame 2: at Denver 122, Minnesota 113\n\nGame 3: Denver 120, at Minnesota 111\n\nGame 4: at Minnesota 114, Denver 108\n\nTonight at Denver, 6 p.m., NBA TV\n\n*Thursday at Minnesota, TBD\n\n*Saturday at Denver, TBD\n\nNo. 3 Sacramento vs. No. 6 Golden State\n\nGame 1: at Sacramento 126, Golden State 123\n\nGame 2: at Sacramento 114, Golden State 106\n\nGame 3: at Golden State 114, Sacramento 97\n\nGame 4: at Golden State 126, Sacramento 125\n\nWednesday at Sacramento, 7 p.m., TNT\n\nFriday at Golden State, TBD\n\n*Sunday at Sacramento, TBD\n\nEastern Conference\n\nNo. 1 Milwaukee vs. No. 8 Miami\n\nGame 1: Miami 130, at Milwaukee 117\n\nGame 2: at Milwaukee 138, Miami 122\n\nGame 3: at Miami 121, Milwaukee 99\n\nGame 4: at Miami 119, Milwaukee 114\n\nWednesday at Milwaukee, 6:30 p.m., NBA TV\n\n*Friday at Miami, TBD\n\n*Sunday at Milwaukee, TBD\n\nNo. 2 Boston vs. No. 7 Atlanta\n\nGame 1: at Boston 112, Atlanta 99\n\nGame 2: at Boston 119, Atlanta 106\n\nGame 3: at Atlanta 130, Boston 122\n\nGame 4: Boston 129, at Atlanta 121\n\nToday at Boston, 4:30 p.m., TNT\n\n*Thursday at Atlanta, TBD\n\n*Saturday at Boston, TBD\n\nNo. 3 Philadelphia vs. No. 6 Brooklyn\n\nGame 1: at Philadelphia 121, Brooklyn 101\n\nGame 2: at Philadelphia 96, Brooklyn 84\n\nGame 3: Philadelphia 102, at Brooklyn 97\n\nGame 4: Philadelphia 96, at Brooklyn, 88\n\nNo. 4 Cleveland vs. No. 5 New York\n\nGame 1: New York 101, at Cleveland 97\n\nGame 2: at Cleveland 107, New York 90\n\nGame 3: at New York 99, Cleveland 79\n\nGame 4: at New York 102, Cleveland 93\n\nWednesday at Cleveland, 4 p.m., NBA TV\n\n*Game 6 at New York, TBD\n\n*Game 7 at Cleveland, TBD\n\n*-if necessary\n\nKINGS\n\nFrom Kevin Baxter: For Kings coach Todd McLellan, there are lessons to be learned from his team’s loss Sunday in Game 4 of their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series with the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe most obvious one, of course, is don’t let a three-goal first-period lead get away. But that’s not the only one.\n\n“There’s some things that we have to fix. And there’s some things that we have fixed,” McLellan said Monday before the Kings left for Edmonton, where the best-of-seven series resumes Tuesday with the teams even at two wins apiece. “You have to keep reinforcing the positives. ‘Look what happens when we do certain things.

And despite a slow start from Prior’s group this year — the team entered Monday ranked 18th with a 4.37 ERA over its first 23 games — the 42-year-old maintains a sterling reputation, combining advanced pitching acumen with a commanding, clear-minded presence.\n\n“I think Mark is just tough, and I really respect that,” Dodgers ace and future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw said of Prior late last year. “Sometimes, it’s not easy to deliver a message to somebody that they don’t want to hear. But [he’ll tell us], ‘Quit being soft. Or go get this guy. Or you’re not throwing strikes. Or you’re not executing.’ Like, ‘I get you’re mad, but fix it.’ And I respect that so much.”\n\nContinue reading here\n\nMax Muncy and Brusdar Graterol to join wave of Dodgers on paternity leave\n\nANGELS\n\nFrom Sarah Valenzuela: These are the games the Angels need to capitalize on in order to continue to contend in this division and this league in 2023.\n\nJosé Suarez did not make the Angels’ first efforts against the Oakland Athletics in this homestand easy, putting the Angels in a 7-1 deficit they had to claw themselves out of. In the first three innings, he gave up five home runs.\n\nJaime Barría allowed the A’s to tie and take the lead in the 9th and 10th innings, and the Angels went on to lose to the A’s 11-10 in the extra inning.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nRAMS\n\nFrom Gary Klein: The Rams spent the last three months acquiring or retaining exactly zero marquee players.\n\nA team that finished 5-12 last season essentially has done nothing to improve a roster that was ravaged by injuries and characterized by underachievement and poor decisions.\n\nBut the Rams’ austerity plan does not extend to the NFL draft, at least in terms of numbers.\n\nWith 11 picks in a draft that begins Thursday in Kansas City, Mo., they could be relying on their selections perhaps more than at any time during coach Sean McVay’s tenure.\n\nFor the seventh year in a row, the Rams do not have a first-round pick. That streak will end in 2024 if McVay and general manager Les Snead break from Rams tradition and refrain from trading it away.\n\nContinue reading here\n\nCHARGERS\n\nFrom Jeff Miller: He doesn’t mock mock drafts. Tom Telesco, instead, participates in them.\n\nThe Chargers general manager estimated that he recently has run “25 to 30” versions through various online simulators in advance of the real thing Thursday night.\n\nThe Chargers have the 21st pick in what will be Telesco’s 11th draft as general manager. They have one selection in each of the next six rounds, as well.\n\nDuring his decade-plus in charge, Telesco had drafted seven players who’ve made 17 combined Pro Bowls. Three years ago, he made his most prized pick: quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nA look at Telesco’s year-by-year history:\n\nContinue reading here\n\nNew York Jets agree to acquire Aaron Rodgers in trade with Green Bay Packers\n\nUCLA GOLF\n\nFrom Thuc Nhi Nguyen: Next month’s NCAA women’s golf championships will be Carrie Forsyth’s last. UCLA’s two-time national championship-winning coach announced her retirement from coaching Monday.\n\nDuring her 24-year head coaching tenure, Forsyth led her alma mater to NCAA titles in 2004 and 2011 and second-place finishes in 2005, 2008 and 2009. Among 106 All-American awards for her players, she led six players to conference golfer of the year awards and guided two — Alison Lee and Bronte Law — to the ANNIKA Award, the top individual honor for Division I women’s golf. UCLA’s five Pac-12 championships under Forsyth ranks second in conference history and leads all active coaches while her six Pac-10/12 coach of the year awards are the most all-time.\n\nContinue reading here\n\n1950 — Charles Cooper, an All-American from Duquesne playing with the Harlem Globetrotters, becomes the first Black person to be picked in the NBA draft when he’s taken by the Boston Celtics.\n\n1952 — The Minneapolis Lakers, led by George Mikan’s 22 points, beat the New York Knicks 82-65 to win the NBA title in seven games.\n\n1964 — The Toronto Maple Leafs win their third straight Stanley Cup with a 4-0 victory over the Detroit Red Wings in the seventh game.\n\n1965 — The Boston Celtics score 42 points on a record 21 field goals in the final quarter of Game 5 to post a 129-96 rout of the Lakers and win their seventh consecutive NBA championship.\n\n1974 — The NFL adopts the 15-minute, sudden-death overtime to avoid ties. The league also moves the goal posts to the back of the end zones.\n\n1985 — For the second time, Wayne Gretzky, scores seven points in a Cup game (3 goals, 4 assists).\n\n1989 — Mario Lemieux ties NHL playoff records with four first-period goals, five overall and eight points as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat Philadelphia 10-7 to take a 3-2 lead in the Patrick Division finals.\n\n1993 — Micheal Williams sets an NBA record for consecutive free throws with 84. He makes 10 straight as the Minnesota Timberwolves beat Utah 113-111. Calvin Murphy held the previous mark of 78 for Houston in 1981.\n\n1993 — Pittsburgh’s NHL-record 14-game playoff winning streak and its overall 21-game unbeaten string are snapped as the New Jersey Devils beat the Penguins 4-1.\n\n1993 — NFL Draft: Washington State quarterback Drew Bledsoe first pick by New England Patriots.\n\n1995 — Major League Baseball returns after a 257-day players’ strike as the Dodgers beat the Florida Marlins 8-7.\n\n1997 — Phoenix’s Rex Chapman makes a playoff-record nine three-pointers en route to career-high 42 points in a 106-101 win at Seattle. Chapman broke the old playoff mark of eight treys set by Dan Majerle of Phoenix against Seattle on June 1, 1993.\n\n1997 — Seattle Mariner Ken Griffey Jr. hits his 250th HR.\n\n2000 — The San Jose Sharks, the Western Conference’s No. 8 seed, eliminate the NHL’s regular-season champions, the St. Louis Blues, with a 3-1 victory in Game 7. The Blues are the second NHL regular-season champion to get knocked out in the first round, joining the 1991 Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n2006 — Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams is suspended for the 2006 season by the NFL for violating the league’s substance abuse policy for the fourth time.\n\n2009 — San Antonio’s Tony Parker matches George Gervin’s franchise playoff record for points in a half, scoring 31 by halftime of the Spurs’ 99-90 loss to Dallas in Game 4 of their series. Parker makes 12 of 17 shots, including two 3-pointers, to help the Spurs take a 55-51 halftime lead. Parker finishes with 43 points.\n\n2009 — NFL Draft: Georgia quarterback Matthew Stafford first pick by Detroit Lions.\n\n2010 — Dwyane Wade sets franchise playoff records with 46 points, 30 in the second half, and Miami staves off elimination by beating Boston 101-92 in Game 4 of an Eastern Conference first-round series.\n\n2013 — Miami’s Ray Allen scores 23 points and breaks the NBA career playoff record for 3-pointers, and the Heat beat the Milwaukee Bucks 104-91 for a 3-0 lead in their first-round series. Allen’s five 3-pointers against the Bucks gives him 322 for his career, two more than Reggie Miller.\n\n2013 — NFL Draft: Central Michigan offensive tackle Eric Fisher first pick by Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n2014 — In a historic vote, Northwestern University football players casts secret ballots on whether to form the nation’s first union for college athletes — a decision that could change the landscape of American amateur sports.\n\n2015 — Ukraine’s Wladimir Klitschko easily outpoints a game-but-outclassed Bryant Jennings in the champion’s first fight in the United States in seven years, defending his heavyweight titles with a unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\n2017 — In a swift response to increasing debates over television reviews, golf’s ruling bodies issue a new decision on the Rules of Golf that limits the use of video evidence and could spare players from being penalized even if they violated a rule. The decision issued — and effective immediately on all tours around the world — has two standards. Players can avoid a penalty if the violation could not be noticed with the naked eye. Rules officials also can eliminate penalties if they feel players made a “reasonable judgment” in taking a drop or replacing their golf balls on the putting green.\n\n2017 — Trea Turner hits for the cycle and drives in a career-high seven runs, helping Washington to a 15-12 win over Colorado.\n\n2019 — NFL Draft: Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray #1 pick by Arizona Cardinals.\n\n—Compiled by the Associated Press\n\nAnd finally..."
