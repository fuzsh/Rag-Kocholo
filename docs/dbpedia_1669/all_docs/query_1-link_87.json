        "text": "Unfortunately, we can’t play Chicago more often\n\nShare this story\n\nShare this on Reddit\n\nShare All sharing options\n\nShare All sharing options for: Monday Morning Minnesota: The “Thank God for the White Sox” Edition\n\nThe Past Week on Twinkie Town:\n\nAfter a snoozer of a trade deadline, and then a series lost versus the New York Mets, the Twins obliged the White Sox and extended their losing streak to 20 games. For the record, the longest losing streak in the modern era is 23 games, held by the 1961 Phillies. The White Sox get to face the Athletics next, so maybe they succeed in not making history.\n\nAs for the Twins, they are now 62-48. They are still in 2nd, 4.5 games behind the Guardians (seriously, I didn’t even edit what I wrote last week), and are the 4th best team in the AL. The Twins still have the No. 2 wild card spot but are now only 0.5 game clear of the Royals. The Twins have an important four-game series against the Guardians to wrap up the week, which may have major implications for the AL Central race. As always, check out our Game Threads and Game Recaps!\n\nZach Koenig provides some flavor on an otherwise boring trade deadline day, bringing us back to 2004 when Doug Mientkiewizcz was traded to the Red Sox.\n\nElsewhere in Twins Territory:\n\nJohn and Ben cover all the Twins news in the last week and recap the Mets and White Sox series - all while trying to maintain their cool after an uneventful trade deadline for the Twins.\n\nThe Twins barely avoided being the only team to not make a trade during the days leading up to the trade deadline, sending prospect infielder Jay Harry to the Toronto Blue Jays for middle reliever Trevor Richards. Considering the values that teams were paying for top-end relievers and rental starters, I’m mildly glad the Twins didn’t get more involved.\n\nLast Saturday, in celebration of Joe Mauer’s induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Twins announced that Mauer will be immortalized with a statue outside Target Field (Do-Hyoung Park, MLB.com).\n\nAs Dan Hayes at The Athletic notes, the disappointing trade deadline is really a result of ownership refusing to increase (or maintain) payroll during the 2024 offseason. ($)\n\nCJ Baumgartner at Zone Coverage attempts to find a silver lining in the Trevor Richards trade.\n\nIn the World of Baseball:\n\nThe Guardians continue to sit atop the AL standings, one game ahead of the AL East-leading Orioles and Yankees. The Mariners are back atop the AL West lead, although they have played two more games than the Astros. The Red Sox currently sit 2.5 games behind the Royals for the third wild card spot.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies still lead the National League, although their lead over the Dodgers has now shrunk to 1.5 games. The NL Central-leading Brewers are 4.0 games behind in the pennant race. The Braves, Padres, and Diamondbacks round out the NL wild card spots.\n\nOld rival Dylan Cease threw the third no-hitter of the season - he might have been able to pick up some wins for this White Sox team if he hadn’t been traded in the offseason."
