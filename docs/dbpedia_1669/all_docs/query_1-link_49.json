        "text": "Boxscore glossary\n\nBasketball stats abbreviations\n\nIf a player records double digits in a game in two of the PTS, REB, AST, STL or BLK statistics, he has a double-double. If he does it in three of this categories, he has a triple-double. If he does it in four categories he has a quadruple-double. Having a triple-double is considered as having a great game. Quadruple-doubles are extremely rare. Having one constitutes an historical performance. The last NBA player to record a quadruple double is David Robinson: it happened on February 17, 1994"
