Following the locally made film, Harvest will be Stray Dogs.

When their mother is put in prison for remarrying after her first husband disappears, brother and sister Zahed and Gol-Ghotai are allowed to stay with her at nights, but chucked out first thing in the morning.

Free to roam the streets of Kabul, they look for a way to join her permanently by trying to get in trouble with the law.

Iranian director Marzieh Meshkini offers compelling insights into the plight of women in post-war Afghanistan.

A simple and impassioned story, powerfully told.
