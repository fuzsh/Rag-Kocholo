Let's look at just one aspect of filmmaking that I find lacking today.\n\nNow I count myself as particularly fond of Art Cinema aesthetics and narrative devices. And although they inhabit sometimes truly abstract or expressive spaces, according to Bordwell (2008), they almost always relate back to a very specific and indeed universal element of the human condition: ambiguity."
