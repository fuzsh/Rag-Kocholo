        "text": "by Susan Abraham\n\nThis afternoon, I read an East African play, The Bride sketched to meticulous poetic detail and hoarded by serious social innuendoes, befitting an era that spelt complexities for a nation’s sharp pursuit of a Woodstock freedom in the 60s and 70s.\n\nIt was a time, stresses Austin Bukenya (Mwalimu) in his introduction, that African plays were viewed an an entertaining form of exotica for the West. He doesn’t say so in as many words – one is immediately aware of Bukenya’s carefully measured tact in all he writes – but I rather got the picture.\n\nThe Bride was first presented as a public performance by the Ngoma Players, under the direction of Nuwa Sentongo, at the Nile Hotel, Kampala in January 1973.\n\nThe Uganda-born playwright, Austin Bukenya, a longtime novelist, poet, critic, accomplished stage actor and sportsman and who has in the past also taught Literature and Languages at universities in Nairobi and Kenya, is fastidious about the creative performances of The Bride, should anyone decide to stage the play.\n\nI first picked up this small book at an old Tanzanian bookshop in Dar-es-Salaam, two years ago.\n\nThe Bride was originally based on a short story, Two Husbands One Night by L.M. Kimaro, vol.1 of Darlite, a literary journal published in Kenya in 1966. Bukenya would reclaim his own version of a play sketched to 4 movements, as a ‘broad experiment in creativity’ and serving as a yardstick for an East African society, determined to find itself.\n\nIn the first movement, the story opens up to drums, music and a fervent dance by Lekindo and his merry band of friends. They skip around for the moon and attempt to conduct an initiation ceremony. Lekindo who’s projected as sensible and clever, is in love with the virginal Namvua. She is late and he is anxious. His tension reveberates through the scene. Namvua possesses a tidy role as principal dancer, in the initiation ceremony, under the big bright moon.\n\nThe tragedy here is that the young maiden is held in prejudice as a ‘foreigner.’ Her father Merio, was one; a man who sprouting up from a different tribe and region, had longed for acceptance, but been appropriately shunned by the village folk.\n\nNamvua found herself treated in equal terms as a pariah. She was not allowed circumcision with the other girls. Later, the rest of the womenfolk would declare her to be not yet reborn into womanhood. They would turn toffee-nosed, considering themselves higher mortals. In fact, it is her long delay now, that causes a group of girls to spit insults in the meantime and demand the spotlight as principal dancer. The girls, refer to Namvua as a she-goat or cow.\n\nLekindo and his loyal friends will have none of this. Arguments break out between the young men and women. Through his defence of Namvua in poetic if not heroic speeches, Lekindo stoutly holds his ground. When Namvua arrives, it is clear from her excuse, that she has had to sneak her way, through another route, dodging two elders – elderly men considered wise men & decision-makers – chatting and blocking the foothpath.\n\nThe girls continue to fight as Namvua dances. Later, the group disperses and there is a moment of tender conversation between Namvua and Lekindo, before he takes her home. The conversations highlight Namvua’s difficulties with regards to social status in her rural African community and Lekindo’s struggle to command his village’s as yet, impalpable compassion. This is not helped by Lekindo’s father, Shundu, who marches in angrily and thunders a lecture. Lekindo stays a true friend to Namvua, even at the risk of greatly angering his father.\n\nThe second movement is terribly comical. This scene highlights a temple and a shrine of the idol, Wanga whom the local folk worship. In Movement Two, the priest, a colourful character and longsuffering husband to his sly wife, Mkumbu, is busy buttering a rich villager, Lesijore. He offers blessings in the hope of receiving a fat donation.\n\nLater Mkumbu turns up and Lemera plunges into what a reader suspects; a habitual groan of moaning for an heir. The temple’s wealth has to be passed down. Mkumbu insists they already have a son. The son turns out be an old skull – the relic of Mkumbu’s dead son – whom Mkumbu still calls Lettie and carries with her everywhere. She cares for the skull with the same tenacity and tenderness as any mother would employ for a living child. She appears as a woman seemingly either cast by a spell or locked in terrible denial. It is clear to the reader that Lemera holds no sentiment for the old skull but is eager to pacify Mkumbu. The couple hatch a plan together. Why not marry Namvua to the decaying object called Lettie, where the old Lemera would then conspire to sleep with her to get his heir. The promise made to Namvua’s father, Merio is an effective one. The village would accept him and his family as one of theirs, thereafter. I found great humour in the dialogue, that despite tradition, ancestry or belief, a marriage would hold similar problems.\n\nMovement Three highlights a thrilled Merio, so pleased with the proposal that his family is to be accepted at long last, by the village folk. He indulges in Lemera’s earlier gift of beer heartily and proceeeds to tell his wife, Tutu, a thing or two. Tutu is shocked beyond words that her daughter is to marry a skull and laments the fact that she will have no happy extended family, with a bunch of grandchildren milling around her.\n\nMuch earlier, also in Movement Three, Lekindo had chanced upon Namvua in the outdoors, while the latter was busy collecting firewood. There ensured a bit of a tease and banter. Their gentle romance is affirmed, nary a bit of wistfulness on her part. However, Lekindo was bent with curiosity as to what sudden affliations, Namvua’s parents had conjured up with Lemera and Mkumbu. Why, he had witnessed just the day before, jolly scenes of the two couples, appearing in jovial episodes together, suggesting an astonishing goodwill and friendship. Namvua swears she knows nothing. Lekindo believes her but is determined to find out more.\n\nThe fourth Movement opens with Namvua waiting with apprehension, to marry her husband in the bridal chambers. There is the sound of drums that signal his impending arrival. Crowds start to gather. In conspiratorial whispers, Namvua’s aunt, Sikitu, opts to give Namvua, some lengthy maternal advice about marriage and encourages the nervous girl, to go ahead with the wedding. Namvua is already lonely and can’t believe that she would find herself surrounded by strangers, she’s not quite sure she’ll like. Sikutu laughs it off, remembering her own lusty moments on her first wedding night, where she screamed and wailed for her parents and fought, clawed and scratched everybody with furious intent, until she had to be tied to her bed, to await her husband.\n\nSuddenly Lekindo dashes into the room with his friends and attempts to rescue Namvua. Namvua had no idea that she would in a matter of minutes be betrothed to a skull, awaiting its lively fate in a bowl. She had been given the vague impression of inheriting the wrinkly Lemera for her husband. In the event that Lekindo and his friends would soon confront the surprised audience, they agree to use not spears, sticks or force but words of peace and tolerance to achieve their means.\n\nHowever, Lekindo cannot resist smashing the doomed ‘Lettie’ to the ground once and for all, and turning the skull to smithereens. The mournful Mkumbu starts wailing as she gathers the pieces together, and Lemera gives way at the end of it all, to allow Lekindo to marry Namvua instead.\n\nBukenya sketches The Bride with a deft hand, almost showcasing his play as a lengthy narrative poem. In this aspect, he has advised actors to recite conversation in its most ordinary manner, where if recited with poetic imaginings, the play may go a -wandering. Imagery is spoken in everyday encounters as if it may have been pronounced as the most normal thing to do.\n\nIn the First Movement, to warn against waiting for Namvua, one of the jealous girls, Kajiru says to Lekindo, ‘The dance is cooling upon our breasts.’ When Tutu tries to advice Namvua about the birds and bees in the Third Movement, fearing her bewildered daughter knows nothing, she later discovers to her horror that Namvua has learnt all she needs to know from her best friend, Lekindo.\n\nTutu mutters with disdain, “Oh, you gods and spirits that bore me, Come here, Namvua, let me look at your eyes and your breasts. Open your breast. Has this Lekindo? Has he…touched you? Tell me Namvua… I have never known a dog that protects meat between its teeth. Tell me and I will tell you all the secrets of the plains.”\n\nAnd back to the First Movement, which I find most enchanting, Lekindo questions unease and anger, “Is this the age-group of fire, that is going to burn away the dead leaves of stupidity which have accumulated upon the plains since Wanga (deity) fired the sun in the sky…”\n\nI was held riveted to the play. I forgot I was reading dialogue and with the right amount of dramatics amounting to tension, joy, music, excitement, nervousness, shock, fear and a wry humour encased in all the right parts, I could well have been watching a film and never once felt bored.\n\nFurther Reading: The Future for Young Writers is Online by Austin Bukenya.\n\nby Susan Abraham\n\nThe Day I Became a Woman (dvd) may be purchased from Amazon.com and or several other online sellers.\n\nRe-written as a fable in my own words and dedicated to the award-winning filmmaker, Marzieh Meshkini who originally produced The Day I Became A Woman for her graduation project except that it was to hit the box office by storm. The screenplay also contained important contributions by Meshkini’s husband, veteran filmmaker, Mohsen Makhmalbaf.\n\n*************\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a very old Iranian woman called Hoorah.\n\nHoorah was so old that she was properly bent and ancient. She could have been a 100. She could have been 101. Or she could have been just 90 years old and not a day more.\n\nThe bent and very old Iranian woman whose name as Hoorah, was still sprightly. Her senses were still able. She heard and saw everything around her clearly. She spoke loudly and in authority as if she were she were in charge of everything.\n\nFor many years, Hoorah lived the hard and simple life of a poor lady. One day, good fortune struck. Hoorah inherited a windfall. The bent old lady made a quick plan to come to Kish to buy all the things that she had dreamed of sadly as a young girl. Being in the money also made Hoorah a little bossy. But she was cheerful when she could have been cantankerous. The idea of wealth put her in a good mood.\n\nOne bright and sunny day on Iran’s calendar, Hoorah flew in an aeroplane on a domestic flight to the sunny island of Kish. A kind air stewardess helped a bent Hoorah climb down the aeroplane. One, two, three and buckle my shoe. One two three and Hoorah would be free.\n\nOutside the airport waited a little ebony-skinned boy who had been sunburnt by the island weather. He had short curly hair, thick dry lips and a happy face. He was very helpful. The little boy had many friends who looked just like him, all rallying around and ready to help.\n\nAs soon as they saw the aeroplane descend, how they all rushed into the airport with their trolleys as if their lives depended on them. The little boys were ready to earn their wages in hard cash. A few minutes later, a skinny little boy wheeled Hoorah in her stylish and capable wheelchair, out of the airport. Hoorah said to the hardy but skinny little boy that she wanted to go to the market to buy some things.\n\nShe suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to feed her rooster as she left home and became upset. Soon, her face would look merry again as she rows of different coloured ribbons that were tied tightly round her fingers. They looked like colourful bows. How she smiled and smiled.\n\nThe skinny little ebony-skinned boy wheeled Hoorah up to a big shopping mall. How the old, bent woman’s face lit up like a Christmas tree as she saw all the beautiful things outside the shop windows. She bought so very many things. Hoorah paid for ornaments and furniture, a wedding dress and make up.\n\nHow will you carry it all back to your home, asked the puzzled boy. I will manage, replied a pleased Hoorah.\n\nShe had bought everything that a young bride would need. The skinny little boy had wheeled her happily about the place. They had spun about, here and there and everywhere. However, Hoorah stayed perplexed that she couldn’t remember what the last ribbon was for. She would never again remember that forgotten item.\n\nSoon, Hoorah tells her new friend of how a potential suitor had cheated her with the betrayal of marriage. She asks the little boy if she could adopt him now that she was rich. The skinny little boy answers with a big grin that he already has a mother. Oh dear!\n\nHoorah says again to the little boy if she could find a place to put up her feet as they aren’t what they used to be. The little boy and his band of merry friends who are all pushing trolleys of many, many big boxes march in solemn procession to the beach. What a gay picture they looked, marching to the beach in a long straight line, next to a busy highway.\n\nThere they go if you can see them. A bent, ancient Hoorah leading the parade in her stylish and capable armchair, the little ebony-skinned boy as the commander-in-charge and his friends trailing after him with the trolleys and very big boxes indeed. Soon, they all reach the beach and the little boys set up house for Hoorah.\n\nThere goes the fridge, here goes the ironing board, add on the cupboards, fix a mirror, hang the saucepans…. All that is missing are the walls and ceiling. Hoorah sits on her bright red settee and ask if the ebony-skinned boy would make her a cup of tea. She also warns the other boys not to mess with her make-up kit.\n\nThe skinny little boy who now fancies himself a butler, fetches a brand new transparent percolator rather importantly from the box and begins to make tea. He is happy to be Hoorah’s tiny butler. “Oh, look at that naked teapot, why did you buy me such a vulgar thing,” Hoorah suddenly starts to chide him. This was the only teapot being sold in the whole of the big wide market, says the little boy sadly, He looks askance. “I feel great shame to use that teapot,” nags a severe looking Hoorah. “Let us go back to the market and and buy a new teapot somewhere else.” “Okay,” shouts the little boy gladly and off they go.\n\nSoon the skinny little boys’ friends all rejoice because “the old lady has gone.” They make up their minds to have a little party. One boy opens the fridge and in the way that it has been mysteriously filled to the brim with coke, juices, milk, vegetable and fruit, starts to raid it. He swallows a ripe yellow banana as far down his skinny gullet as it can go.\n\nAnother experiments with a lip and eye pencil. He tries to shape his eyebrows, carefully touch up his long lashes and spreads on as much lipstick on his thick lips, as he dares. He splashes perfumes on his nipples and the spray makes them look as white as snow. He experiments with deodorant under his armpits. It is a serious, elaborate affair. The cosmetics are meticulously and vigorously applied so that the little boy may appear as beautiful as a bride. Another boy wears the wedding dress and slips on the veil.\n\nOne of his friends come to wrestle with him. The boy wrestles with his friend on the bed, the long wedding dress and veil rolling round and round together with them. One little boy in an Afghan costume busily hoovers the carpet of beach-sand. He loves his chore.\n\nAnother grabs the new bathtub and takes it out to sea. His friend starts to bathe him while he sits in the bathtub. Soon the boys gather to beat on the hanging saucepans and playact a wedding march. The boy with the wedding dress dances on and the rest follow, waving colourful umbrellas high above them. To the drumbeat of the saucepans, they sashay to a festive dance….\n\nRound and round a big wide circle they caterpillar together, the guest-of-honour being the little boy dressed in the wedding veil and gown. After a while, one little boy alerts the rest that Hoorah has returned in her wheelchair. Now, the little boys run helter-skelter to keep everything back in its place.\n\nHoorah notices nothing.\n\nThe little boys volunteer to help build floats so that Hoorah and all her processions can be transferred to ships sailing by in the distance. Hoorah asks the cute little boy in the Afghan costume to stay behind and make her tea. He doesn’t appear to know how to make the tea although he stays willing and cheerful. “Why did I buy all these kitchen things for if you can’t even make a cup of tea?” she scolds.\n\nHoorah begins to stare at him without flinching and finally asks if she could adopt him as he is so handsome. She likes his white, pink colour, she says. He suggests that she consider his pals instead. Oh no, protests Hoorah. They are too brown whereas he is a handsome little boy, all white and pink to look at. The white and pink boy in his Afghan costume looks sad and says no because he already has a mother and father. He is worried that Hoorah will take him away with her.\n\nTwo pretty Iranian girls park their bicycles and come to talk to Hoorah. They have just cycled in a race and tell her stories. The old lady listens amicably. The girls hint that if only they had her possessions; if Hoorah would be so kind as to give everything away, then they could get married and start a new life. Hoorah refuses apologetically and explains that the possessions are gems from a life of waiting. She cannot part with them now.\n\nShe invites the girls to tea and they all sit down together on the lounge chairs. It starts to get dark and the little boys rush back to say that the floats are ready and everything has to be transported at once or the ships will sail away, never to be seen again. The tide would soon get lower. Hoorah readily agrees.\n\nNow I can go home to feed my rooster, she says happily. What about our tea, wail the girls? They are disappointed. They find Hoorah fascinating and had hoped to chat longer. Hoorah comforts them for such is the call of destiny, she smiles.\n\nShe is eager to get home and feed her rooster. Soon each item is tied together onto a different float.\n\nThe boys complete the whole project in the wink of an eye as if by magic. Hoorah herself sits high on her bed as it balances gingerly on one float. It is a strange surreal scene as the army of boys push Hoorah and all her possessions out to sea.\n\nThere she sits as a tall and aristocratic as a grand dame in the middle of it all. As the boys push her and all her treasured possessions out to sea, she fades further and further away until soon there is nothing left but a speck on the distant horizon. An unreal freedom is left behind to beguile the minds and visions of shocked watchful observers on the coastline.\n\nFilm’s Website. The second still shows a grand Hoorah poised majestically while sitting on a bed tied to a float and stretching out to sea.
