        "text": "Recently we watched a wonderful film called Stray dogs (Sag-haye velgard). Unfolding like a documentary the film is a gripping and sadly funny tale of a brother (Zahed) and sister (Gol-Ghatia) who are desperate to be reunited with their parents in post-Taliban Kabul. Only problem is, their parents are in jail. The father, whom we never see, is a Taliban who has been imprisoned by the Americans. The mother is imprisoned too for having married a second time as she thought her husband was dead in the war and now is accused of infidelity.\n\nThe film starts with Zahed and Gol-Ghatia rescuing a cute white mutt from a gang of street kids wielding blazing torches, who wants to burn it as it is thought be a white man’s dog. Having rescued the mutt, the kids head off to spend the night at the women’s prison where their mother is being held. Every night the children spend with their mother until one day they stop taking night prisoners. The children are literally on the streets now. They try to camp with a boy who is hiding from the police for having stolen. The brother and sister decide to steal too so that they could be sent to prison and be with their mother. Their first attempt at stealing is a television set from a man gone mad from American brutality. Their second attempt is a loaf of bread from a beggar woman. They plead with her to complain to the police but she just slaps them and tells them to beg for themselves if they are hungry and lets them go scot free.\n\nFinally, the young thief instructs them to watch the Italian film The Bicycle Thieves — my all time favorite — and learn how to steal. After being inspired by the movie, they steal a bicycle from a busy market road. But only Zahed is caught even though the little girl screams she is also a thief she is ignored. The boy, much to his disappointment, is not sent to the prison where his mother is but to a prison for boys. The lonely little girl again attempts to see her mother by knocking on the prison door by announcing she is the thief’s sister.\n\nYou must be wondering how such a story can appeal to a six-year-old. It does simply because of its simplicity. Yes, there were some problems which seemed natural to me but inexplicable to Esha. Like the beggar woman in a burqa! The first sight of her covered from head to toe made Esha wonder how she could see! I told her about the net in front of the eyes and that traditional Muslim women are not allowed to show their face to any male except their husbands. I did not know how to explain that under the Taliban’s rule, the burqa became a symbol of oppression for Muslim women. Before Taliban rule, wearing of the burqa was optional. Also in the Qur’an Allah’s word, as stated by Mohammed, is that women should cover their “beauties.”\n\nThe next perplexing aspect to Esha was why the mother could not remarry when she thought her husband was dead anyway! No explanations here because I totally agreed!\n\nWhenever I watch Iranian films, I never think they are actors playing the part, but they are actually the characters. The little girl’s range of emotions is mind boggling. And finally after watching the film I came to know that this film was made by Marzieh Meshkini, a woman. I mention this only because people constantly bombard us with questions like how different is it being a ‘woman’ director. I always maintain that the viewer will be or should be least bothered whether it is a woman or a man directing a film as long as a film enthralls you, entertains you as well as makes you think."
