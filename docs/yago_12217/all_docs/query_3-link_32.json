        "text": "The Front Row\n\nHow Agnès Varda Became an Icon of Cinema\n\nAn enthralling new biography shows the boldness and the freedom with which the French director confronted professional obstacles and personal troubles.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nAgnès Varda’s Extraordinary Cinematic Accomplishment\n\n“Agnès by Varda,” in which the late French filmmaker reviews her own career, is being released posthumously this week.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nHighlights from the Third Week of the New York Film Festival\n\nA filmmaker’s illuminatingly introspective last work, a richly textured drama, and a documentary about the convergence of entertainment and justice.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nWhat to Stream: The Astonishing Iranian Film “The Day I Became a Woman”\n\nMarzieh Meshkini’s three-part film is a masterwork of symbolic cinema; it depicts, with vast imagination, the ordeals faced by women in modern Iranian society.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nWhat to Stream This Weekend: Agnès Varda’s Chronicle of a Parisian Pop Star’s Dread-Filled Afternoon\n\nFeaturing the sights and sounds of Paris with voracious delight, “Cleo from 5 to 7” embraces the turbulent distractions of public life, even as it filters them through the protagonist’s mortal terror.\n\nCulture Desk\n\n“While I Live, I Remember”: Agnès Varda’s Way of Seeing\n\nIn more than sixty years of filmmaking, the woman known as the Godmother of the French New Wave charted a course unlike any other. Her wave was her own.\n\nPostscript\n\nAgnès Varda’s Radically Personal Films\n\nThe filmmaker, who died this week, was so far ahead of the world of cinema that she had to wait for it to catch up to her.\n\nRichard Brody\n\nAgnès Varda’s Lost Sci-Fi Romance, “Les Créatures”\n\nIn a 1966 movie starring Catherine Deneuve, Varda transformed science fiction into a subject in her own image.\n\nPersons of Interest\n\nAgnès Varda Is Still Going Places\n\nGoings On About Town\n\nThis Week\n\nRichard Brody\n\nStyle Sense"
