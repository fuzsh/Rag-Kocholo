        "text": "The film narrates the life of a girl (Gol-Ghotai) and a boy (Zahed), siblings living in post-Taliban Kabul. Their father is a priest who was imprisoned as he fought against the Americans in a Taliban War. His wife is also behind bars. However, she is accused of infidelity now as she got married again as she thought her husband was dead in the war. Every night the children spend with their mother in jail. One day the prison commander denies all “night prisoners” and Gol-Ghotai and Zahed become homeless. It’s a wintertime and they try to find a place to stay overnight but still they dream to come back to their mother’s prison. They are advised to steal something to get imprisoned by the police. After several robbery attempts which nobody noticed, finally Zahed steals a bicycle and his sisters cries and calls him a thief for everybody to notice. Zahed gets imprisoned, but in another jail than his mother."
