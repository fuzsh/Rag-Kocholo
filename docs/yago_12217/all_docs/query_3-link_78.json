Alice Guy-Blache\n\nYears before anyone decided American movie production was going to be a boys’ club, Guy-Blache was running film studios in Queens and New Jersey, after having already essentially invented movie narrative (little more than a year after the movie camera had been invented).\n\nHer films — the last was made in 1919 — featured interracial casts, special effects, and experimental sound technologies.\n\n2. Lois Weber\n\nA one-woman powerhouse of pioneering movie-industry energy, Weber wrote, directed and produced well over 100 films in the century’s first two decades, her innovative output making her in the day as famous as D.W. Griffith.\n\nShe invented split-screen storytelling, used full-frontal nudity, made the first Tarzan film, relentlessly pursued socially controversial topics (like abortion, eugenics, and prostitution), and eventually owned and ran her own studio. Only changing tastes (hers were very old-fashioned and sanctimonious) and the coming of sound could slow her down.\n\n8. Ida Lupino\n\nIt’s a little easier, in any era, to begin directing when you’re already a movie star, but Lupino was a fighter. She began as a teen in the early ’30s, and starred in dozens of films during the next 15 years, mostly in a contract with Warner Bros. that she hated. She refused assignments routinely, and spent a lot of time suspended, until she decided to go rogue, form a company with her husband in the late ’40s, and start making her own movies. The best of them — Outrage (1950), The Hitch-Hiker (1953), and The Bigamist (1953) — are among the toughest of low-budget film noirs.\n\n10. Agnes Varda\n\nThe queen bee of the French New Wave, Varda started earlier than any of the boys (her first-born child predated most of those films), ranged wide (exploratory documentaries, long and short, were always part of her agenda, and some of her films have no category), and remains as active as ever today, deep into her 80s.\n\nShe began as a photographer, and never went to film school. The films to see are Cleo from 5 to 9 (1961), Vagabond (1984), her biopic of the late Demy, Jacquot des Nantes (1991), and the autiobiographical doc The Gleaners and I (2000).\n\n12. Larisa Shepitko\n\nShepitko was something like the Soviet New Wave Carole Lombard to her husband Elem Klimov’s Clark Gable, the two of them made extra glam by their thorny run-ins with the censorship bureau and, most of all, by Shepitko’s tragic 1979 death in a car wreck, amidst shooting her fifth feature.\n\nHer surviving films are beauts, particularly her last, the in-your-face Eastern Front war saga The Ascent (1977), and her first, Wings (1966), one of the great movies about women’s lives, and a rare exploration of female mid-life crisis.\n\n13. Sarah Maldoror\n\nSince the New Waves broke, the world’s been watching women filmmakers in developing nations find their voice and the nerve to raise it. Maldoror is a key figure — born to Caribbean parents in France, she’s been making movies since 1968, focusing on the African struggles for independence and with post-colonial life.\n\nHer epic film Sambizanga (1972), about the Angolan fight for freedom from colonizer Portugal, shot entirely in the Congo, was seen all over the world.\n\n14. Rakhshan Bani-Etemad\n\nIn Iran, women can get arrested, jailed or even beaten in public for exposing their hair or bodies in public, or touching men they’re not married to, and from this situation arose Bani-Etemad, the most prolific and widely beloved woman director in what is still one of the world’s most remarkable film cultures.\n\nThe absurd Sharia Law rules about what you can and cannot do on film have in fact been loosening in the last decades, due in part to Bani-Etemad’s popular insistence and social conscience. (In 2000’s Under the Skin of the City, a woman touches a man — by slapping him.)\n\n15. Marzieh Meshkini\n\nWhen Meshkini, wife of famed Iranian auteur Mohsen Makhmalbaf, wanted to make her first film The Day I Became a Woman (2000), she had to pretend she was shooting three shorts films instead — because short film scripts didn’t require official approval by the mullahs in charge.\n\nThe resulting tripartite saga takes a humanistic torch to Iran’s attitudes toward women, and while it won awards at festivals in Toronto, Venice, Chicago and Thessaloniki, it was, predictably, banned in Iran.\n\nWhat is Smashcut?\n\nSmashcut partners with universities and organizations to develop and deliver customized online film programs.
