        "text": "The latest summer comedy, \" ,\"is a very bad boy. Well, it's a naughty film, and in more ways than one. The dialogue, spoken through CGI mouths plastered on real-life dogs, sounds like George Carlin's infamous stand-up routine, and nearly every dog penis joke that can be made is played until they've gone and buried the bone. But \"Strays\" is also a bad boy for greedily taking our talking dog nostalgia and bludgeoning it with a predictable plot, a senseless script, a waste of talent and a completely bewildering and exceptionally short cameo by Dennis Quaid playing an imbecilic, bird-watching version of himself.\n\nAfter all, most 90s kids still retain the trauma from Shadow's near-catastrophic ending in .\"Those talking animals got us through every road trip we ever took growing up. We certainly do not appreciate filmmakers using the sweet spot owned by Shadow, Chance and Sassy so tastelessly against us. It doesn't work anyways. The animal characters in \"Strays,\" cute as they are, create no relationship with viewers. Their connection to the film is to perpetuate the gag, not fiddle with heartstrings.\n\nIf the film itself were a dog, it would be a homeless mutt, a dirty, smelly, unlovable street urchin lacking redeemable qualities and needing some time-out in the crate. This same kind of thing was done a few summers ago with except instead of innocent dogs, it was pre-pubescent kids cursing and handling drugs while on a journey that felt artificial and over before it even began. \"Strays\" is much of the same, a reason to string gag- and joke-filled consecutive scenes with a weak tie-in to an utterly ridiculous plot.\n\nIf you do so care about the premise: the film finds scrappy pup Reggie (Will Ferrell) far from the only home he's ever known. Unfortunately, it was his degenerate owner Dave (Will Forte), who drove and ditched him hundreds of miles away in the first place. Dave likes to smoke, drink and do naughty human things; Reggie, a dog he got to impress a girl once upon a time, is cramping his style. Instead of continuing to berate and neglect this sweet pet (Reggie thinks his name is a string of expletives, the only terms his loser human ever called him), Dave deserts him in a big city where Reggie meets Bug the Boston Terrier (Jamie Foxx), Maggie the Australian Shepherd (Isla Fisher) and Hunter the Great Dane (Randall Park), three dogs who are purportedly friends but who, in an actual dog park, would never give one another the time of day.\n\nFerrell's Reggie sounds a lot like his character Buddy from \" ,\"with his wholesome naïveté and lack of worldly knowledge. The schtick is cute for a time but runs its course before the foursome can even get on with their harebrained journey whose end goal is - and this is their actual objective - to find Dave and bite his private part off in retaliation for being a complete POS. The adventure leads the quad through a scary, firework-infested county fair, over a mountain where they ingest hallucinogenic mushrooms and go on a bunny-killing rampage, in the pound at an animal control office where pooping is their ticket out, then finally back to Dave for the pièce de résistance.\n\nMuch of the film relies on the juxtaposition of its cute, obedient leads and the foul things they are forced to do or say. Foxx is let loose, seemingly improvising the gab for his tough, street-smart terrier. There are a few moments that garner a chuckle, mainly from dog lovers who can appreciate the eccentricities specific to the species. (Personally, the scene I found most comical was when the dogs moved in circles, trying to find the perfect way to lay for bedtime; it was a small, innocuous moment that was far funnier than all the \"bitch\" jokes combined.)\n\nFor viewers who like a raunchy, throw-away, plot-light 90-minute comedy, then \"Strays\" will certainly scratch that itch. The jokes hit fast, and the humor is cuter coming from the fluffy mouths of man's best friend. I stand by the strange Quaid cameo, which was blink-and-you-miss-it and felt so very random, even in a talking animal movie. Otherwise, \"Strays\" could have been a short viral video, racking up views, watched offhandedly from a personal device and forgotten shortly thereafter. As a feature film, it's simply a tedious, ruff watch."
