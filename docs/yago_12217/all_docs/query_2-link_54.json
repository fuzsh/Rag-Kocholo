Tsai's oblique approach to space and time renders Stray Dogs an often mysterious work whose tactile and sodden images investigate the emotional boundaries of privation and deep loneliness.",

        "text": "Description\n\nMaster filmmaker Tsai Ming-liang’s work often reveals an affinity for the natural world and its elements, especially rain and water. And in Stray Dogs the cold of the wind and the driving rain provide a fitting backdrop for Tsai’s tenth feature in which an impoverished family consisting of a father and two children (and two shifting maternal figures) try to survive in modern day Taipei. Loneliness and sadness permeate the tableaux in what is an incredibly tactile work with surfaces, especially those of walls, taking on a sharp tangibility. One such surface–the rock-strewn floor of an abandoned building and the mural it lies before–gives off the otherworldly feel of a lunar plain. Tsai’s camera is patient and watchful, peppering the film with extreme long-takes. The daunting duration of these scenes simultaneously coax and frustrate the viewers’ attention as our eyes scan the frame upon which the minutes unfurl while the characters’ actions and faces slowly build to and sustain moments of desperate emotion. In the end, these long shots become mesmeric in their revelation of pulsating sadness and despair and longing in this bold and often mysterious work. –Veronika Ferdman\n\nTrailer\n\n//player.vimeo.com/video/90584877?autoplay=1\n\nFilm Details"
