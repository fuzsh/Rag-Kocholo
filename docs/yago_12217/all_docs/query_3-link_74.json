        "text": "BY now, anyone who reads the newspapers is aware that Kandahar is the name of the city in southern Afghanistan that has become known as the Taliban's main stronghold. It is also the name of an extraordinary film by the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf that was shown at this year's Cannes and Toronto film festivals and which will be released in New York next month. When I saw ''Kandahar'' at Cannes in May, I was transfixed by its images and moved by its story of an exiled Afghan woman venturing back into her native country to search for her sister. The world it depicted seemed, to me and to other Westerners in attendance, far away and even -- in part because of the lyricism Mr. Makhmalbaf brings to his grimmest pictures of war and deprivation -- exotic.\n\nExoticism has long been part of the appeal of what we parochially call foreign films, but our tendency to perceive the beauty and drama of other lands through the veil of mystery has its dangers. ''Kandahar'' begins and ends with exquisitely surreal sequences whose underlying horror seeps gradually into the mind as their beauty dazzles the eye. The film opens with parachutes drifting into the desert. Attached to them are pairs of prosthetic legs, which are being airdropped into an international aid station, where they will be distributed to people whose limbs have been blown off by land mines. At the end, a wedding procession consisting mainly of women dressed in colorful burkas makes its way across the empty sand and is stopped by a Taliban patrol, and again the poetry of the images clashes with the terribleness of what is being shown.\n\nMr. Makhmalbaf's story has the strangeness and clarity of a dream, but it also has a documentary immediacy and a moral urgency that is, belatedly and under pressure of recent events, clearer to an American viewer than it was six months ago. Afghanistan is closer now, and the rest of the world is more deeply involved in its suffering. The point of Mr. Makhmalbaf's film is that this has always been the case. The heroine, though Afghan, is also Canadian, and her narration, whispered into a tape recorder she hides under her burka, is in English. On her journey to find her sister she encounters a one-armed thief and a boy who has been kicked out of a madrasa, or Islamic school, for failing to memorize verses of the Koran, and also an African-American doctor whose account of his reason for being in the country is vague.\n\nThe release of ''Kandahar'' coincides with a surge of American interest in anything having to do with Islam and the Middle East, and it is one of a number of movies that offer some help to those trying to understand the complexities of the current situation. Like ''Jung (War) in the Land of the Mujahedeen,'' an Italian documentary that opens today (review, below), it illuminates not by offering analysis but rather by bearing witness to the brutality of the war and to the condition of women under Taliban rule. The last shot in ''Kandahar'' -- of the sun, seen through the mesh of a burka -- is echoed in ''Jung,'' and it is a powerful visual symbol of this impulse.\n\n''Kandahar'' is one of several recent Iranian films that touch on the situation in Afghanistan, whose decades of war have sent more than 1.5 million refugees into Iran. Majid Majidi's ''Baran,'' which was shown at the New York Film Festival last month and which will be released next month in New York and Los Angeles, is the story of a young Iranian laborer who falls in love with an Afghan woman who arrives, disguised as a boy, to work on his construction site. Hassan Yektapanah's ''Djomeh,'' which played at Film Forum last summer, is also a cross-cultural love story, about an Afghan immigrant's infatuation with a shopkeeper's daughter in a rural village. Unlike ''Kandahar,'' which ventures into the heart of the Afghan tragedy, these films allow the war to hover in the background, shadowing their delicate, elliptical fables of ordinary life.\n\nOver the last decade, Iranian filmmakers have specialized in delicate, elliptical fables of ordinary life -- frequently the lives of children -- that often communicate a latent intensity. Mr. Majidi's previous film, ''The Color of Paradise,'' to date the most popular film from Iran to be released in the United States, dealt with childhood blindness and poverty in a way that might have been unbearably sentimental but was instead luminous and heartbreaking. ''The White Balloon,'' directed by Jafar Panahi and written by Abbas Kiarostami, follows a young girl through the streets of Tehran in her search for a suitable pet goldfish, but the gentleness of the story never lapses into cuteness or triviality.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
