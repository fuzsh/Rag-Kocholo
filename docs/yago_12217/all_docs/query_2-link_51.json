        "text": "Towards the end of this masterpiece, we watch two characters look. So much of this film is a about the act of looking, and of making the viewer aware of their gaze. After all, what is cinema but the act of looking? In this scene, it is clear what one character is looking at: the man at the back is looking at the woman in front.\n\nFrom the very first frame of this film, we are presented with enigmatic compositions. Extended, static setups show us the prosaic rhythms of life. These sequences are long, usually unbroken by cuts, and there are no establishing moments: we build this up over time. Later, we are able to thread a chronology and establish…\n\nSeeing this at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival was one of the key screenings of my moviegoing life. I had seen a few of Tsai Ming-liang's movies, but I still wasn't prepared for the sheer slowness of this one, which climaxes with a 14-minute shot of two characters staring at something offscreen. Somewhere around minute nine or ten, I think something in my brain broke. Staring at the screen for that long felt like being stranded without a map: \"How long is this going to go on? \"\n\nI liked the movie a lot, by the way, and it has been reverberating in my head ever since. A major lesson I first learned from Jeanne Dielman and that was reinforced…\n\nA perfect culmination of all the themes, motifs and styles that have inhabited Tsai's films throughout. This is kind of a dream film for a Tsai fan combining Lee Kang-Sheng, leaky buildings, lonesome alienated people wandering around silently with some of the shifts that came with Visage - the ever longer takes and the switch to even less of a focus on narrative and something more akin to filming of performance art. Which reminds me that I need to rewatch Visage one of these days. And I don't know if its because of the two kids or because of my attachment to Lee Kang-Sheng and Chen Shiang-chyi from Tsai's earlier films but unlike Visage, I was deeply moved by this…\n\nBlue and pink and yellow enshroud the people, holding back the water that constantly spills over them. They stand alone in empty fields, busy streets, abandoned buildings, living just beyond the reach of other people, in darkness penetrated only by the most insignificant of lights. It would be easy to take their isolation as a metaphor for modern living or Taipei's society, but it seems like far too simple an interpretation. The care and effort put into every shot (probably only around 70 or so) suggests a great deal of thought went into every part of the film, including the ideas behind it.\n\nCertain images stand out, even in a film that never wastes a shot on anything less than…\n\n69/100\n\nStill playing catch-up on TIFF '13. Tsai goes a tad overboard here with the stasis, which twice becomes unproductively grueling in my opinion; reportedly, a full 27 minutes of the film is just people staring at that damn mural. (I'm okay with the cabbage.) His compositional sense remains as strong as ever, though—just the gradual way he reveals the area where Lee stands with his real-estate sign is masterful—and I continue to groove on the bent for casual, integrated surrealism he's been working ever since The Wayward Cloud (though I guess one could argue that it really starts with The Hole). The sudden mid-film leap into the ruined apartment seems to have multiple interpretations, judging from reviews—I initially assumed…\n\nStray Dogs frustrates me like most of Ming-liang Tsai's works. It may not be as tedious and inaccessible as Goodbye Dragon Inn, thanks to its somehow refreshing Dardenne-lite social commentary and a semi-intriguing mystery-solving process, but at the end of the day, Tsai's stubborn fascination with his stagnant long shots just turns me away.\n\nStray Dogs probably has one of the most down-to-earth premise in Tsai's filmography, by depicting a homeless single father's struggles to raise his two children. It didn't opt to provoke this time with heavy sexuality or bizarre, metaphysical concepts. There are tons of moments of mesmerizing realism that bring to mind the best of Haneke or Ulrich Seidl, and Tsai's muse Lee Kang-sheng simply gave his…\n\nSo many of the films I saw at TIFF have a righteous fury to them. Denis shoots her work through with socioeconomic outrage; Jia Zhang-ke's A TOUCH OF SIN is vicious; Sono's goofy new feature is as self-lacerating elegy for the death of film; and here is Tsai's possibly last film, which foregrounds political angst and economic duress in his cinema of regret in a way I've not seen in his other work (though I have enough blind spots to prevent any confident claim this is his most political work). Digital opens up for Tsai a kind of extremity of editing, one defined not by the info dumps now possible but in takes longer than 35mm reels could handle. As…"
