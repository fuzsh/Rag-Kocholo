        "text": "Before the dust of war settles, a wave of films documenting life in the ruins invariably surfaces. Particularly in its early days, stories of ruin and rebuilding were told almost exclusively through tales of men, young and old, traversing bombed-out cities searching fruitlessly for work and semblances of the old world order. Marzieh Meshkini and her two daughters, Samira and Hana Makhmalbaf, together resist the dominant approach within neo-realist cinema of dramatizing nationalism within theatres of masculinity. Set in Afghanistan during the immediate post-Taliban years, their films chronicle the struggles of the displaced through decidedly female perspectives. Contrary to the conventional focus on men in urban ruins, their films, particularly Samira Makhmalbaf's At Five in the Afternoon (2003) and Meshkini's Stray Dogs (2004), follow women, young and old, as they venture beyond the city into the expanse of the desert. In both films, these women's journeys are orchestrated by the men in their lives. Yet, there is clear indication that the desert becomes a site of the feminine, a counterpoint to the polis and its orders of patriarchy. This inadvertent staking of a female exilic domain transforms the desert into a womb. This interpretation of the films is informed by biopolitical paradigms outlined in Giorgio Agamben's Homo Sacer (1995) and psychoanalytic frameworks instated in Luce Irigaray's Speculum of the Other Woman (1973). However, while these films amplify the audibility of female voices, feminine inaudibility is inflected on another level: that of filmmaking. Hana Makmalbaf's Joy of Madness (2003), a documentary chronicling the production of At Five in the Afternoon, complicates readings of the latter film as straightforwardly feminist. In adhering to the neorealist ethos of using non-professional actors, the film opens questions of directorial violence, which here manifests woman-on-woman. Also pertinent are the colonial implications of the Makmalbafs, affluent Iranian auteurs backed by state and international patronage, filming destitute postwar Afghans. Ultimately, this paper assesses the first significant emergence of female voices associated with the figure of the refugee. It argues that there is a desire to locate a feminine domain beyond the domestic and inscribe an alternate, audible female voice into the discourse of the aftermath. Concurrently, this paper rejects easy labels of these films as \" feminist \" , especially when assigned by virtue of their filmmakers' genders. It maintains that female-led, female-centered films, particularly within the neorealist tradition, is complicated by power relations evident in the hypertext."
