        "text": "Sunday September 20th 2015, Iranian Movie Night: At Five in the Afternoon (Persian: پنج عصر, Panj é asr‎) by Samira Makhmalbaf, Iran, 2003, 106 min.). In Dari Persian with English subtitles. Door opens at 8pm, film begin at 9pm. Free admission.\n\nIt tells the story of an ambitious young woman trying to gain an education in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban. The title comes from a Federico García Lorca poem and is a tale of flourishing against the odds. At Five in the Afternoon was the first film to be shot in Kabul after the NATO invasion.\n\nAfter the fall of the Taliban regime, the schools again open their doors to girls. Nogreh (Agheleh Rezaie) dreams of liberation. She wants to become Head of State (following Benazir Bhutto’s example), in order to reform the status of the Afghan woman. But the girl and her family only meet misery and desolation in a country in ruins.\n\nThis third full-length film by the talented Iranian filmmaker is without question her most pessimistic. It’s the prolongation of the segment she directed within the framework of the collective film 11′ 09′ 01. It also echoes the film Kandahar, directed by her father.\n\nMore info about the director: http://www.makhmalbaf.com/?q=marziyeh\n\nMore about the film: http://www.makhmalbaf.com/?q=film/At-five-in-the-afternoon\n\nFilm night at Joe’s Garage, cozy cinema!

In Persian with English subtitles. Door opens at 8pm, film begins at 9pm. Free admission.\n\nIt is comprised of three interconnected vignettes that depict women at three stages of life in Iran. It premièred at the 2000 Venice Film Festival and won several festival awards during 2000. This film is episodic and it consists of 3 stories about the women’s situation in Iran.\n\nFirst story: Hava\n\nOne morning a small girl named Hava wakes up and notices that she has become a woman because she is now 9 years old and playing in the streets with the boys is considered a sin from that day on. Hava cries and asks her grandmother to go to the street for one last goodbye with the boys.\n\nSecond story: Ahoo\n\nThis episode is about a young lady whom participates in the women’s bicycle race with her black traditional chador (veil) and her husband, while riding a horse, threatens to divorce her if she doesn’t get off the bicycle.\n\nThird story: Houra\n\nThis episode is about an old woman whom has inherited some money during the last years of her life after years of poverty and now she has decided to spend all the money before she dies and to buy all the stuff that she always wished to buy during her life.\n\nThe film was co-written by director Marzieh Meshkini, from a script by her husband Mohsen Makhmalbaf. It was shot on Kish Island in the Hormozgān Province in southern Iran. Meshkini has said that as a female filmmaker, she found making a film in Iran particularly difficult, having to prove her abilities to the cast and crew before being accepted by them.\n\nMore info about the director: http://www.makhmalbaf.com/?q=marziyeh\n\nMore about the film: http://www.makhmalbaf.com/?q=film/the-day-I-Became-A-Woman\n\nFilm night at Joe’s Garage, cozy cinema!
