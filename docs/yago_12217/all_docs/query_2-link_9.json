        "text": "Film: Stray Dog\n\n1949, dir. Akira Kurosawa\n\nLegendary director Akira Kurosawa’s Stray Dog set the template for police procedural and buddy cop films for years to follow. The film is an early collaboration between Kurosawa and famed actor Toshiro Mifune, who stars as a young detective whose gun is stolen on a hot, crowded bus. Desperate to right the wrong, he goes undercover, scavenging Tokyo’s sweltering streets for the stray dog whose desperation has led him to a life of crime. Costarring Takashi Shimura as the seasoned detective who keeps him on the right side of the law, Stray Dog (Nora inu) goes beyond crime thriller, probing the squalid world of postwar Japan and the nature of the criminal mind.\n\nThis film appears as part of our GAME CHANGERS Series, featuring twelve films that revolutionized cinema. Each film in the series represents a bold step forward; using new and adventurous techniques, courageous directorial visions, or telling stories from new points-of-view.\n\nIn addition to the screenings being free of charge, all twelve films are preceded by a Happy Hour starting at 6:30pm, featuring half price beer and wine as well as free snacks and soda. Join us and experience a piece of cinematic history!\n\nThe Bardavon/UPAC film series is sponsored by Marshall & Sterling, Herzog’s, and Woodstock Film Festival."
