        "text": "TEHRAN Marzieh Meshkini, director of the recently made Iranian film The Day I Became a Woman, said that by making her film, she aimed at upgrading women's status in Iran. The Day I Became a Woman is Meshkini's first experience in the field of cinema. It won three prizes at 57th Venice Film Festival. Meanwhile, Meshkini's film and a film from Thailand jointly won the prize of 25th Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nMeshkini, 30, in an interview with IRNA said that The Day I Became a Woman has a hopeful look at women's problems and issues in Iran. She underlined that the film comprises three episodes about an Iranian nine-year-old girl named \"Hava\", a young women named \"Ahoo\" and an old woman named \"Houra\". Meshkini noted that the second episode of the film shows that problems do not exist for all women in Iran, adding that as a female director, she didn't face any obstacle in making her film.\n\nThe young Iranian female director added that she is determined to make further films about Iranian women, adding that a female director can understand and portray traditional and social problems of women better. She concluded by saying that women should have self-esteem in order to make further progresses and improve their social status."
