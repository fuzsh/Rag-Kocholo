        "text": "There is something about me and Iranian cinema that just does not jell. Director Samira Makhmalbaf worked from a screenplay by her father, Mohsen, which must have looked dodgy on paper and which she leans fully into in one of the nastiest films I can recall seeing - at least Pasolini had a political point to make with Salo (1975). The Makhmalbafs may have a political point to make here or be working a larger metaphor or analogy, but if they were, it was lost on me.\n\nThe premise is an intriguing one. A pre-teen Afghan boy, credited as The Master (Haron Ahad) has had one leg amputated mid-thigh and the other below the knee after his mother stood on a land mine which killed her. His father is taking the boy’s severely disabled sister to India for surgery, so hires Guiah, the horse-child (Ziya Mirza Mohamad), to act as the boy’s legs, carrying him on his back to school and generally doing whatever the boy commands him to. Guiah lives underground in some kind of underground bunker. The Master has money and status; Guiah, played by a non-professional actor with some form of cognitive impairment, has neither.\n\nWith Guiah at his mercy and egged on by his schoolmates, the Master goes full-blown sadist, treating Guiah like a horse, down to fashioning him a rope bit and bridle and hiring him out to his classmates whom he encourages to mistreat his “horse”, going so far as to nail horseshoes to Guiah’s boots and acquiring a horse-head mask for him to wear.\n\nI thought, initially, that this was providing recognition for actors with disabilities (we see The Master’s stumps several times) but very quickly got to the point of trying to work out where the dividing line is between recognition and exploitation. Wherever that line is, the Makhmalbafs step well over it and the result is a film which is borderline unwatchable. The way in which Mohamad is treated in the last part of the film is every bit as unethical as the way Abbas Kiarostami treated some of his non-professional actors in several of his films, with the additional factor that these are actors with disabilities.\n\nYuck and double yuck from me."
