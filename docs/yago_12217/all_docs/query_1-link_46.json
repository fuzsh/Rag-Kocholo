        "text": "As usual, I’ve let time get away from me, and several months have passed since I last updated. But I was also on holiday for much of June, and as one of my stops was the Il Cinema Ritrovato film festival in Bologna, I’m going to do a week catching up with what I saw there. Better late than never, and anyway these aren’t ‘new’ films; they are ones worth catching up on, many of which (at least the restorations) may yet be appearing at film festivals over the next year or two, and eventually on home media—which, for the record, isn’t dead; the limitations of streaming are well known, and DVDs and Blu-rays will always have a place in everyone’s home (I predict a vinyl-like resurgence).\n\nAnyway, like many film festivals, Il Cinema Ritrovato has a number of strands. Some are dedicated to filmmakers, others to actors or screenwriters (amongst other filmworkers), and some have broader more intangible ideas behind them. One of the repeated strands for the last few years has been the ‘Cinemalibero’ strand, dedicated to uncovering and restoring the best of what used to be called ‘Third Cinema’, but is probably better referred to as the cinematic output of developing countries, many in Africa or the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, though works from South America and other territories occasionally slip in.\n\nProbably my favourite film in the strand, partially because it surprised me but also because I’m largely unfamiliar with where it’s from or the filmic tradition in that place, is the Odia-language film Maya Miriga (The Mirage, 1984), which is to say a film from Odisha state (Ollywood!). The Film Heritage Foundation involved in restoring this film so painstakingly over the last few years (using damaged materials, not that you would have known from their excellent work), also worked on a Manipuri film I saw earlier this year (Ishanou, 1980), and I appreciate their commitment to focusing on marginal and almost lost works from regional Indian cinema. This film is set among a family who are not quite poor but live in a decaying home in one of the smaller cities of Odisha (or Orissa as it was formerly known). They have a caring relationship with their children and they want the best education for them, which seems to be paying off for the second son who has a much valued entrance exam to the national administrative service in Delhi, making him a bit of a local hero. The older brother feels like he’s failed in just being a schoolteacher and his wife is fairly bitter about her place, expected to be at home and give him children and when she doesn’t even seem to get any retrieve from the second son’s wife (who is too fancy to want to live there), she pays that frustration forward. This film took a while to work on me—there are, I think, four sons, all of whom have very similar names—but as a grand family drama somewhat in the mode of some contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien films, this is impressive and I found myself rather loving it.\n\nAnother recent restoration is the epic length Camp de Thiaroye (1988) from Senegalese master Ousmane Sembène. It deals with a real history of colonialist atrocity during World War II, and really deserves a better review than this one (written in the moments snatched before the next film I saw), because it has a seriousness of purpose though nevertheless a light touch for all that. However if it makes one thing clear it’s about the level of exploitation and callousness that goes into upholding the idea and ideological underpinning of “Europe”, something that continent has been doing for at least the last 500 years but which is starkly brought into focus here. It’s never really as bleak as it could be (at least, until it is), thanks to the humanity brought to these characters, with various national backgrounds and languages, pulled together by war and French colonialism. That said the Americans are hardly heroes either and there’s a perilous sense of allyship on display. It’s a great work, one of Sembène’s best, and it’s great that it’s had this restoration on the 80th anniversary of the events it depicts.\n\nThe final film I saw in the strand was The Nouba of the Women of Mount Chenoua (1978), directed and written by esteemed Arab feminist writer, Assia Djebar. It is by no means a straightforward film, which is of course fine, but it’s a dense text of poetry and allusion to history that is not always explained (or, at least, not always translated). However it builds up a compelling atmosphere of stories and songs about women in Algeria, both those of the present and ones evoking the past, in a poetic voiceover and in words spoken in dialogue between characters we see on screen. The print is clearly in need of restoration, having faded to almost monochrome with gentle pinks and greens when we can perceive any colour, but that gives it an additional atmospheric feeling of being almost a lost text.\n\nBy contrast, one of the first films I saw in this year’s film festival was the rediscovered and restored pre-revolutionary Iranian film The Sealed Soil (1977), a work by an unheralded and (sadly largely now forgotten) woman director, who never had the chance again to make a feature film. Anyone watching this film should be aware it’s slow: it develops as a series of domestic scenes of women preparing food and doing chores in their courtyard and only slowly, over the first half hour or so, do you even get a sense of who the protagonist is, Rooy-Bekheir (Flora Shabaviz), in her burgundy headscarf. Indeed we only really get anything like a close-up on her face (more of a medium shot) a couple of times in the film but it becomes clear she is 18, not yet married at this apparently advanced age and something of a burden to her family. That said, the film doesn’t feel bleak even if her life doesn’t seem to have much of a path forward in this patriarchal society. When she sits in the rain, taking off her headscarf, while harvesting flax, that feels like a moment of calm for her, away from her endless chores. It doesn’t quite end like Jeanne Dielman, and one doesn’t expect it to by the end, but it’s not so far from that kind of filmmaking.\n\nI’m rounding up this post with a Syrian film, The Night (1992), another that hasn’t been restored but at least still exists in a nice quality print. The same director’s film Dreams of the City (1984) was in the festival last year and this year we got the bonus of the director himself, Mohammad Malas, to give an introduction. This story takes us back to the beginnings of independent Syria and the post-World War II partition that created the State of Israel, so it’s fair to say there’s a lot of feeling around that which hasn’t really dulled in the intervening years. The film itself is a poetic and very personal reflection on the director’s youth, filled with a sort of nostalgia but also a streak of humour, as with the constant changes of regime that are marked with a staged photograph. That said it does move very quickly and would probably reward a deeper knowledge of the specific regional history. The 35mm print remains lovely to look at, even with its dual language subtitles, and should be better known really.\n\nCREDITS\n\nମାୟା ମିରିଗ Maya Miriga (The Mirage, 1984) [India] — Director Nirad Mohapatra ନୀରଦ ମହାପାତ୍ର; Writers Mohapatra and Bibhuti Patnaik; Cinematographer Raj Gopal Mishra; Starring Bansidhar Satpathy, Kishori Devi କିଶୋରୀ ଦେବୀ; Length 113 minutes.

The latest from auteur Jafar Panahi, the most prolific man to be banned from filmmaking, is a typically self-reflexive and complex take on his own situation, and all three of these films to a certain extent address living under authoritarianism.\n\nTerrestrial Verses (2023). This is a high concept film with a succession of scenes, frontally shot, of individuals interacting with an offscreen authority figure. It does a good job of presenting certain aspects (mostly frustrating, antidemocratic or divisive) of modern Iranian society and for that it’s certainly welcome. The performances are great and the frame is cleanly and effectively filmed in Academy ratio. However the vignettes do tend towards a certainly samey-ness which can make even the relatively short running time a bit of a slog. More effective to me as an idea than as a fully expressed film but I appreciate it—given one of the scenes of a filmmaker dealing with a censor in particular—that it must have been difficult to make.\n\nSubtraction (2022). We’ve all seen films that play on the idea of meeting your doppelgängers as a basis for comedy, and there are times during this Iranian film that you feel it might go that way, the audience letting out some nervous laughter at the set-ups, especially when all the central characters first meet one another. However, the dark night-time tones of the cinematography, the fact it is always, constantly raining, and the creeping dread in the musical score already strongly hint that this is not going to go that direction, as indeed it moves further into the horror genre than anything comedic. Still, fantastic performances from both Taraneh Alidoosti as the two wife characters, and Navid Mohammadzadeh as the two husbands. Even if it feels increasingly likely that what will happen is going to happen (and then it does), the film keeps you on edge for much of its running time, and there’s never any confusion as to which character is which, despite the increasingly baroque plot.\n\nNo Bears (2022). Like a lot of Jafar Panahi’s films, this one is a puzzle, a metatextual Russian doll that never quite resolves itself—in the way of his master, Abbas Kiarostami—but leaves quite an impact all the same, for those attuned to his wavelength. Once again he plays himself as a filmmaker, trying to make a film (a man who, despite his ‘house arrest’, certainly manage to travel around and make plenty of art even so). As the title cues you up, the film does not have any bears in it. Or at least we don’t see any. Maybe they do exist, just off screen. Maybe two lovers kissing are also just off screen. Panahi is asked this by some villagers in the very traditional Azeri society of the border village he’s in (near the Turkish border, from where he’s remotely directing a film), as they are concerned that this couple is breaking their code. Panahi denies having taken a photo of them, but we see him taking a photo of something. Maybe it’s the lovers (maybe it’s some bears); who can say. It doesn’t matter, though. Everyone has their own idea of what is happening, and those ideas have real world consequences. It feels like an angry film, even as it’s a coded attack on the authorities who have curtailed his ability to make and distribute his art, and there are lives at stake both inside and outside of the frame, in the narrative and beyond it.\n\nCREDITS\n\nآیه های زمینی Ayeh Haye Zamini (Terrestrial Verses, 2023) — Directors/Writers Ali Asgari علی عسگری and Alireza Khatami علیرضا خاتمی; Cinematographer Adib Sobhani ادیب سبحانی; Starring Majid Salehi مجید صالحی; Length 77 minutes.

Seen at the Capitol, Melbourne, Sunday 20 August 2023.\n\nAfter last week’s review of the Iranian film Hit the Road at Whānau Mārama – New Zealand International Film Festival, the festival screened another quite different film from the same country, the kind of thing that doesn’t get screened in its home country due to some pretty direct criticisms of the regime. It’s long, depressing, and in several parts, but pretty great all the same.\n\nI feel like if you’re going to do an issues-driven drama based on contemporary society—and this one is about the death penalty—then this is the way to do it. It’s not unclear what the filmmaker’s point of view is—it’s clear enough, indeed, that he’s had to endure prison sentences and bans on filmmaking over the last few years—and he goes in pretty hard on his own country’s use of the death penalty, though despite being made in Iran and featuring its cities and countryside rather beautifully, it’s a story that could be told anywhere that the death penalty exists.\n\nLike a lot of Iranian films, the focus is very much on the moral quandary of those involved in it, which range the gamut from bland acceptance to turmoil. The first segment lulls us in with a very quotidian story of a middle-class family that could be in any western country and whose bickering and patterns of life are entirely relatable, before a stinging twist at the end. Indeed, having booked to see the film a month ago, it wasn’t until the end of the first story that it became clear to me what the structuring conceit of this film was.\n\nThe second and fourth stories seem to be continuations of one another—in the earlier one, a young military conscript rebels against the requirement that he get involved in an execution, while in the last an older man who did the same when he was a kid and ran away to the countryside, comes to terms with the choices he made in terms of his family. The film indeed is very interested in moral choices that aren’t made in a vacuum, but take place in terms of ensuring one’s own freedoms, one’s own family and work, and the extent to which we should or should not accept capital punishment if it’s just a means to get food into mouths or to live the life you want (given that the person being executed is just going to killed by someone else).\n\nIt’s not necessarily an easy subject, but the filmmaking is clear and flows beautifully, with solid performances across the board. It is entirely deserving of its awards, and one can only hope that the filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof can continue to make films.\n\nCREDITS\n\nDirector/Writer Mohammad Rasoulof محمد رسول‌اف; Cinematographer Ashkan Ashkani اشکان اشکانی; Starring Ehsan Mirhosseini احسان میرحسینی, Kaveh Ahangar کاوه آهنگر, Mahtab Servati هتاب ثروتی, Baran Rasoulof باران رسول‌اف; Length 150 minutes.

These two films are about two such children, who may have grown up either surrounded by conflict and in the often painful absence of their parents (as in the Palestinian story of What Walaa Wants) or, at the other extreme, in complete ignorance of their parents and revolutionary activities, having begun a new life in exile away from those traumas (as with the Iranian daughter of revolutionaries living in Germany, in Born in Evin). Neither film can be entirely satisfactory, because it feels like two people grappling with uncertainty about how to exist in the world, given these backgrounds, but both are illuminating about the generational nature of resistance and trauma.\n\nWhat Walaa Wants (2018). Like a lot of observational documentaries, this takes a chunk of a person’s life (maybe six years or so) and tries to make some sense of it, but given the person being followed is trying to make sense of what to do with her life herself, there are relatively few tidy strands. She is Walaa, of course, and in the midst of her teenage years her mother has been released from an Israeli prison, having been there for eight years. We never actually hear why she was put there, or what her story was (and from a post-film Q&A it seems to have been a fascinating one), because the film prefers not to dwell on the past or the violence and oppression constantly surrounding this town in Palestine—it’s something we’ve seen all too often, and get presented to us on the news all the time—in favour of the younger woman and how she sees her future. Because there are limited prospects, we find her focusing on the police to find some grounding: she does well enough academically but is bored at school and is a troublemaker.\n\nThis quality of course makes her stand out as a documentary subject, but also, given her situation, makes you really worry this film is going to move towards a really depressing ending. Thankfully it doesn’t, but it does try to maintain the sense of the constant pressures of occupation, as well as the dangers inherent in their lives, which for all that we see are filled with plenty of joy and community too. Walaa’s period of time training at a police academy are also covered, though she takes some time to lose her attitude, and it’s a wonder she ever graduates, and probably as much down to the eagerness of the authority to get new recruits. Certainly her involvement with the police isn’t universally welcomed within her family, and that suggests further tensions within this brittle society. Still, it’s a solid portrait of one young woman, and her carefully trodden path within this society.\n\nBorn in Evin (2019). Clearly a very personal documentary which follows the director Maryam Zaree as she tries to uncover the circumstances around her birth, which she learns was in Evin prison in Tehran, famous for being the main site for holding Iran’s political prisoners, for its poor conditions and for its many human rights abuses. Zaree’s desire to learn about her early life is certainly personal and touching to watch, but throughout the film I felt an increasing sympathy with her mother, who just doesn’t want to relive the experiences that she has clearly worked so hard to move past, making a new life for herself in Frankfurt with a new husband and a successful life in politics. Zaree at one point seems to position her mother’s lack of testimony to her time spent in the prison as a painful affront to Zaree’s own existence, that she’s hiding something that will help to unlock her own complicated feelings around her origin—and maybe she is; undoubtedly it’s deeply felt—but it seems as if the only thing her mother is hiding is a deep-seated desire to avoid talking about what must clearly have been the worst and most dispiriting time in her life. Obviously the stories of the pain and suffering have their place—and we see a glimpse of formal hearings around human rights abuses—but ultimately the filmmaker’s mother is most eloquent in her very lack of desire to open up, which leaves the film in a precarious position that the director ends up acknowledging with an inconclusive ending.\n\nCREDITS\n\nLPFF 2019: What Walaa Wants (2018) [Canada/Denmark] — Director Christy Garland; Cinematographers Garland and Hanna Abu Saada; Length 89 minutes.

Perhaps in time I shall make it to smaller subdivisions, but let’s start big. I had thought I might work through them from largest to smallest, but I don’t want to put all the challenge of finding films from obscure nations at the end of this project, so I’m going more or less alphabetically, starting with Afghanistan. I’ll provide a small potted summary of (let’s face it) the Wikipedia page in each entry.\n\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan افغانستان\n\npopulation 32,226,000 | capital Kabul (4.3m) (کابل) | largest cities Kabul, Kandahar (614k), Herat (556k), Mazar-i-Sharif (469k), Kunduz (357k) | area 652,230 km2 | religion Islam (99.7%) | official languages Dari (دری) and Pashto (پښتو) | major ethnicities Pashtun (47%) and Tajik (27%) | currency Afghani (Af/Afs) [AFN] | internet .af\n\nA mountainous country located on the historic Silk Road, connecting it to major trade routes. Its name historically means “land of the Pashtuns” although it has a wider modern application, and though populated since prehistoric times, politically it was established in the 18th century by the Hotak dynasty and the Durrani Empire. The British, of course, made their influence felt in the following century and fought three Anglo-Afghan Wars, with independence officially declared on 19 August 1919. It was a kingdom until a coup in 1978 installed a President as the head of a democracy. In recent times, fundamentalist Taliban forces took control in the late-1990s, but were pulled into regional conflict following the September 11 attacks, which led to the toppling of this regime and the restitution of democracy.\n\nCinema first came only to the royal court in Afghanistan and it wasn’t until 1923 that the first film was publicly screened. The first Afghan film production was in 1946, and regular production didn’t start until the late-1960s, with training from the Soviets. The Taliban cracked down on cinema upon coming to power in 1996, and film production didn’t begin again until 2002. The NZ documentary A Flickering Truth (2015) was made about the Afghan film archives, while Motley’s Law (2015) is about an American lawyer working in the country. An interesting recent film set in the 1980s is the drama/musical The Orphanage (2019).\n\nStray Dogs (2004). In the 2000s, the Makhmalbaf family really seemed to have a stranglehold on portrayals of post-Taliban Afghanistan, and this film by Marzieh (Mohsen Makhmalbaf’s wife) joins those of her daughters Samira and Hana in depicting some of the turmoil and poverty of the country in this era. It uses neorealist tropes in a very knowing way, even using footage from Bicycle Thieves (1948) as a set-up for the denouement, as well as hooking into a venerable Iranian tradition of films using child protagonists (the girl Gol-Ghotai and the boy Zahed) as a window into a harsh and difficult world. Even a cute dog only sharpens the sense of desperation, and the two kids first try to get the girl’s mother out of jail and then try to get themselves thrown into jail with her. If it sounds tearjerking, it’s never quite played that way, as everyone is just making an effort to get on with living.\n\nCREDITS\n\nسگ‌های ولگرد Sag-haye velgard (Stray Dogs, 2004) — Director/Writer Marzieh Meshkini مرضیه مشکینی; Cinematographers Ebrahim Ghafori ابراهیم غفوری and Maysam Makhmalbaf میثم مخملباف; Starring Gol-Ghotai گل غتی, Zahed زاهد; Length 93 minutes.
