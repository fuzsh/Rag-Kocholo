        "text": "With Director Debra Granik in person!\n\nHarley-Davidson, leather, tattooed biceps: Ron \"Stray Dog\" Hall looks like an authentic tough guy.\n\nA Vietnam veteran, he runs a trailer park in rural Missouri with his wife, Alicia, who recently emigrated from Mexico. Gradually, in Debra Granik's new documentary, a layered image comes into focus of a man struggling to come to terms with his combat experience.\n\nWhen Alicia's teenage sons arrive, the film reveals a tender portrait of an America outside the mainstream.\n\nSTRAY DOG is a powerful look at the veteran experience, a surprising love story, and a fresh exploration of what it takes to survive in the hardscrabble heartland.\n\nFollowing this screening of STRAY DOG, UMass Professor Anne Ciecko will join us for a conversation with director Debra Granik.\n\nAbout Debra Granik:\n\nDebra Granik is the Academy Award nominated director and co-writer of Winter's Bone, which was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini were Oscar nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nHer first feature film, Down to the Bone, won Granik the Best Director prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival."
