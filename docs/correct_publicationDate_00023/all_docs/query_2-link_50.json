He was a doctor turned Hollywood Sci-Fi writer. (ex. Jurassic Park) His book Next might be just what you are looking for.\n\nAllen Dean Foster is another Hollywood Sci Fier. His work strays farther from reality. (ex. Alien)\n\nThe Uplift Wars were good reads with some bio., but more other stuff. The same with some of Vinge's books.\n\nAs far as I know, only Crighton's were close enough to reality to have scientists denounce him in some weird sort of backhanded praise. (Why denounce a fiction writer because their science is off? Kind of crazy if you ask me.)\n\nrootone said:\n\nI can't think of any sci fi which does not involve biological stuff.\n\nHi @rootone:\n\nYou have an interesting way of thinking about sci fi. Do you mean that because sci fi is almost always about living things, typically people, it is about biology?\n\nI interpret the OP's question to be focusing on the particular science that is being fictionalized in a sci fi story. I believe that the first sci fi story specifically about biology is Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, the plot being about creating an artificial life from dead parts. From what I read, the most common biological sci fi science is genetics. The movie Gattaca is an excellent example. The Nancy Kress Beggars in Spain trilogy is my favorite genetics fiction story.\n\nRegards,\n\nBuzz"
