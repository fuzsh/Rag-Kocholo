She is one of the first twenty so-called \"Sleepless\" in a world that will initially treat them as interesting anomalies ... and, later, as objects of envy and scorn.As the decades pass, the Sleepless population increases and prospers - and Leisha grows to become one of the ablest legal minds in America. But the heightened abilities and a shattering revelation about the near-immortality of \"her kind\" has inflamed the wrath of the nation's Sleeper majority - spawning political repression and shocking mob violence that drives the Sleepless en masse from a society that rejects them ... and, ultimately, from the Earth itself.But Leisha Camden remains behind - outcast from both worlds, yet unwilling to forfeit her rightful place in the community of man. Meanwhile, aboard an orbiting colony called Sanctuary, a new generation of genetically engineered super-children is born - the foundation of a brilliant and bitter Sleepless leader's devastating conspiracy of freedom ... and revenge.
