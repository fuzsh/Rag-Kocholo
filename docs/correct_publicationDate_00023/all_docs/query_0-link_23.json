        "text": "Good, recommended, though at times iffy!\n\nThis was a very listenable audiobook with some interesting ideas. It certainly held my attention and kept me involved. At the same time, it constantly seemed to be channeling other, similar books. Most frequently, \"Atlas Shrugged\", with many long-winded and somewhat repetitive passages about makers and takers, in the one-dimensionality of many of the characters, and in the (SPOILER?) decision of the makers to separate themselves (unlike Ayn Rand's, however, Kress does not seem to making a political statement with one \"side\" clearly in the right; this is a much more balanced examination of the societal split). Then we have similarities to Ender's Game, and other books about super children. And other similarities that have drifted from my mind... sorority stories? Animal Farm?\n\nAnd yet it remains readable and enjoyable. The premise is interesting. I often wished that the author had limited the extra abilities of the sleepless to just not sleeping, and gone into more detail about that. I mean, the brief touching upon parents who couldn't deal with babies that never slept was a glimpse into what could have been a really fascinating exploration; and I would have liked to see more of the psychological effects on adults of not sleeping - of no downtime, of no escape, of solitary nights, etc. In the book it's pretty much all up side, and augmented by several other \"super powers\"... I'd rather have seen more detail and more realistic balance of benefits and deficits of sleeplessness.\n\nAtlas Shrugged meets Gattaca, but less believable\n\nBeggars in Spain is an interesting thought experiment, but unfortunately, the follow through was unsatisfying. The world and characters felt very limited and I don't think the subject portrayal aged well, in terms of elitism, ableism, 1%ers, etc. I did finish the story, but I jumped to 1.75 speed or higher to get through some of the longer diatribes. It has its good moments, but felt just okay overall.\n\nThe book will most likely appeal to people who like Atlas Shrugged esque premises and social science fiction (i.e. without starship battles or time travel).\n\nI think the biggest obstacle for my enjoyment was the main character Leisha Camden, whose fixed perspective, naivete, and (painfully) slow realizations make her an unreliable poster child of the \"super smart\" sleepless group. I had trouble buying the degree of separation between sleepers and sleepless anyway, and Leisha's portrayal compounded my skepticism.\n\nA promising start\n\nThe first two thirds of this book was pretty good. The premise was interesting and how The two societies of sleepless and sleepers grew and came into conflict was very well developed. However it is not very exciting and after 12 hours of listening I was just bored. I did not finish this book.\n\nA similar idea of super intelligent and competent people and what they owe or do not owe the lesser mortals is more interesting and exciting in books by Ayn Rand"
