        "text": "science fiction 'Moonseed' restores classical sense of wonder\n\nBy Fred Cleaver\n\nScience Fiction Columnist\n\nOct. 25 - Stephen Baxter's \"\"Moonseed'' (HarperCollins, $24) is a book of literally Earth-shattering action. As in Wil McCarthy's \"\"Bloom,'' Baxter presents a relentless nano-organism eating away at the planet. McCarthy dealt with events years after the Earth died, while Baxter describes the planet's breakup, with special attention to the destruction of Scotland.\n\nHenry Meacher is a geologist whose pet exploration project for the moon has been canceled by NASA. As a consolation prize, he is one of the geologists chosen to study a long-neglected and sealed specimen from an old Apollo moon landing. Henry and the sample are sent to Edinburgh for the study.\n\nIt proves to be a very strange rock. It eats olivine, a basic ingredient of other rocks. When it escapes the lab, it quickly goes through the surface rocks and releases the dormant volcano underneath Edinburgh. As the moonseed spreads, volcanoes, earthquakes and tidal waves are unleashed all over the Earth.\n\nThe destruction of the planet is only a prelude to Baxter's main theme: figuring out a way for NASA to get back to the moon in a hurry if it really has to get there. Henry wants to go to the moon to study the origin of the moonseed. A bootstrap plan gets him there along with his secret plan for saving mankind.\n\nFrom special-effects wizardry to some old-fashioned \"\"Hey kids, let's go to the moon!'' enthusiasm, Baxter provides the sense of wonder of classic science fiction.\n\nÒNancy Kress specializes in the effects of biotechnology on our future. Her short stories are regular attractions in the best of the year anthologies. \"\"Beaker's Dozen'' (Tor, $24.95) brings together her recent work.\n\nThe most famous story here is the award-winning novella-length version of \"\"Beggars in Spain.'' This presents the core ideas of the subsequent trilogy of novels about children engineered for super-intelligence who must build their own society in a resentful world.\n\nAnother fascinating story of children altered for their parents' expectations is \"\"Dancing on Air,'' about the world of ballet. The split between the world of enhanced and natural dancers is partly told from the viewpoint of an intelligence-enhanced guard dog.\n\nIt's not all biology. There's a retold fairy tale and God applying for an artist's grant, among others showing Kress' range. The majority of stories explore our transformation through biology in the way that has made Kress such an important and unique writer.\n\nÒKress pursues genetic engineering in the here and now in the fast-paced bio-\n\ntech thriller \"\"Stinger'' (Tor, $24.95). A strain of malaria that infects mostly blacks is loose in a remote part of Maryland. FBI agent Robert Cavanaugh investigates this as a racist hate crime. Melanie Anderson is the only member of the scientific team who sees this as a conspiracy. She knows this not only from the evidence of the disease, but also from the racist hate calls she receives while trying to investigate the epidemic.\n\nSocially clumsy Robert and angry Melanie are on their own when their investigations begin to point to a coverup. They combine conventional police work and science to solve the mystery. As in her more futuristic stories, Kress shows the possible effects of biotechnology on real people. It's bit of the \"\"X-Files'' with more interesting characters and a more sensible plot.\n\nÒCyberpunk has something of a nostalgic air this long after its introduction in the 1980s. \"\"Tea From an Empty Cup,'' by Pat Cadigan (Tor, $22.95) is still in that mode in a thriller of kids and crime in cyberspace.\n\nThe place to be in cyberspace is post-apocalyptic Noo Yawk Sitty, which re-creates a world of trendy and snobbish nightclubs. A tough cop is forced to enter this world when kids start returning dead from this supposedly safe virtual world. The victim is known as Shantih Love, and the cop takes the persona of Love into cyberspace to find the truth.\n\nAt the same time, Yuki is venturing into this world in search of her missing lover Tom Iguchi, who appeared to be using the Shantih Love name. They are both exploring a place where the one unchanging truth is that everything is billable time. The prize in this virtual playground is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic Tokyo to replace the lost real-world Japan.\n\nThe events of the outside world leading up to this are never explained, but the real world is only of minimal importance to cyberspace. One of these real-world details that supposedly matters is that the real Tom Iguchi may be genuine Japanese, which would be real prestige in the supposed New Tokyo.\n\nCadigan eventually sorts all of this out, and some of the re-creations of silly real-\n\nworld obsessions in the virtual world are funny. Still, \"\"Tea From an Empty Cup'' is behind the curve of cutting-edge science fiction. This is too bad, because being on that cutting edge was essential to the cyberpunk movement."
