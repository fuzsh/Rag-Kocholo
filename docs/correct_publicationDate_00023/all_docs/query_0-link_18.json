        "text": "American science fiction writer (born 1948)\n\nNancy Anne Kress (born January 20, 1948) is an American science fiction writer.[1] She began writing in 1976 but has achieved her greatest notice since the publication of her Hugo- and Nebula-winning novella Beggars in Spain (1991), which became a novel in 1993. She also won the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 2013 for After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall,[2] and in 2015 for Yesterday's Kin. In addition to her novels, Kress has written numerous short stories and is a regular columnist for Writer's Digest. She is a regular at Clarion Workshops.[3] During the winter of 2008/09, Nancy Kress was the Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the University of Leipzig's Institute for American Studies in Leipzig, Germany.[4]\n\nBorn Nancy Anne Koningisor in Buffalo, New York, she grew up in East Aurora and attended college at SUNY Plattsburgh and graduated with an M.A. in English.[5] Before starting her writing career she taught elementary school and then college English. In 1973, she moved to Rochester to marry Michael Joseph Kress. They had two sons, and divorced in 1984. At that time, she went to work at Stanton and Hucko, an advertising agency. She was married to Marcos Donnelly from 1988 to 1994.\n\nIn 1998, she married fellow author Charles Sheffield, who died in 2002 of a brain tumor. Kress moved back to Rochester, New York, to be near her grown children.[3] In 2009, she moved to Seattle.[6] In February 2011, she married author Jack Skillingstead.[7][8]\n\nKress tends to write hard science fiction, or technically realistic stories, often set in a fairly near future. Her fiction often involves genetic engineering and, to a lesser degree, artificial intelligence. There are many invented technologies shared between her stories, including \"genemod\", to refer to genetic engineering, and \"foamcast\", a lightweight and sturdy building material that appears in many of her novels and short stories.\n\nBy conducting extensive research, she keeps her topics within the realm of possibility; however, as Kress clarified for one Locus interviewer, with regards to her partner and fellow science fiction writer, \"[Sheffield] pronounces it science fiction, and I pronounce it science fiction.\"[8]\n\nKress also loves ballet, and has written stories around it.\n\nNebula Award\n\nBest Short Story winner (1986): \"Out of All Them Bright Stars\", F&SF March 1985\n\nBest Novella (1991): Beggars in Spain (Axolotl Press / Pulphouse Feb. 1991) / Asimov's April 1991\n\nBest Novelette (1998): \"The Flowers of Aulit Prison\", Asimov's Oct./Nov. 1996\n\nBest Novella (2007): \"Fountain of Age\", Asimov's July 2007\n\nBest Novella (2012): \"After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall\", Tachyon Publications\n\nBest Novella (2014): \"Yesterday's Kin\", Tachyon Publications\n\nHugo Award\n\nBest Novella (1992): Beggars in Spain (Axolotl Press / Pulphouse Feb. 1991) / Asimov's April 1991\n\nBest Novella (2009): \"The Erdmann Nexus\", Asimov's Oct./Nov. 2008\n\nJohn W.
