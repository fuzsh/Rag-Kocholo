        "text": "And Wild for to Hold • (1991) • novella by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. The Church of the Holy Hostage kidnaps people from history in the hope of reducing deaths and suffering of many. When they take Anne Boleyn from the Tower of London, she starts manipulating those around her in an attempt to regain some power over her destiny.\n\nOut of All Them Bright Stars • (1985) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. Brief and full of import. A waitress in a diner serves an alien, but learns a hard truth about humanity that she never wanted to know. One of those stories that transcend the genre and could be enjoyed by anyone who loves literature.\n\nPathways • (2013) • novelette by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. Kress writes with great empathy for her characters. This is the story of a bright young woman with no education trying to save her family from a horrible genetic disease by courageously volunteering for a medical experiment that she doesn’t understand. I absolutely adored this.\n\nDancing on Air • (1993) • novella by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. Unsolved ballerina murders, many of whom have altered their bodies to get an advantage. An enhanced guard dog’s POV. Painful dynamics between mother and daughter.\n\nUnto the Daughters • (1995) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nAverage. Feminist Garden of Eden story told from the perspective of the snake.\n\nLaws of Survival • (2007) • novelette by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. A young female scavenges within the Dome that aliens placed to imprison humanity. She stumbles into a facility where she, with a simple robot companion, must train dogs or face her own destruction. Compelling, charming, and with solid suspense.\n\nSomeone to Watch Over Me • (2014) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. An obsessed mother, recently divorced with restrained orders against her, secretly has illegal surveillance cameras implanted in her small child. Her obsessive observation of her ex-husband’s new life sends her spiraling out of control.\n\nThe Flowers of Aulit Prison • [Probability Universe] • (1996) • novelette by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. An excellent exploration of an alien culture that takes a communal shared reality very important, people are punished by being declared dead and then ignored. A woman who killed her sister in a fit of rage is given the change to be a prison informant against a human who is believed to be plotting something against the state.\n\nThe Price of Oranges • (1989) • novelette by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. Charming tale of two older men in 1989 who sit, talk, and try to make the best of life. One man travels back in time 1937 to buy things at must cheaper prices —- and maybe find a man to make his granddaughter happier.\n\nBy Fools Like Me • (2007) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. A brief and painful story about overreaction caused by suffering. In an eco-apocalypse, remnants of the old world’s wastefulness (such as books made from trees) are Sins to be destroyed. A dying grandmother and her granddaughter come across a bundle of books. They decide to read them instead of immediately destroying them and they pay the price for that ‘betrayal.’\n\nCasey's Empire • (1981) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nAverage. A young man who wants to be a science fiction adventure writer experiences obstacles to that dream from the academic literary establishment … and then UFOs.\n\nShiva in Shadow • (2004) • novella by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. A very impressive piece of space adventure. A three person crew is made up of two scientists and a nurturer/leader, who narrates the story. They are on a mission to explore anomalies from a massive black hole. The story is full of old-school scientific research and psycho-sexual interplays of jealousy and betrayal. What makes the story even better is that, when a probe is launched, the story splits between the perspectives of the real humans and their digital personas on the probe.\n\nGrant Us This Day • (1993) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nPoor. A kinda stupid religious story in which God is a failing art student and the earth is his project that has gone off the rails. Ironically, this feels like amateurish student work when compared to the rest of Kress’ stories.\n\nThe Kindness of Strangers • (2008) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. Aliens are destroying the world’s largest cities. One by one. At the same time, a woman is having an affair with a man whose family dies in one of those cities. The two of them are shuffled into a containment camp with other refugees. Very well written characters and a powerful and difficult message for humanity.\n\nEnd Game • (2007) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. A socially stunted scientist discovers that ‘static’ in the human brain impairs our ability to accomplish things. He tests a new drug on an assistant who becomes a chess savant, but less human.\n\nMy Mother, Dancing • (2004) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. A heart wrenching story about a far future humanity that has perceived religious implications to the Fermi paradox. If we are alone in the universe, it is our obligation to populate the universe. What if we are wrong?\n\nTrinity • (1984) • novella by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. A difficult, disturbing, and riveting masterpiece. Seena tries to save her sister Devrie who is slowly killing herself by starvation as part of a scientific/religious cult/experiment that is using twins to try to prove the existence of God. The experiment works with two mind together, so Seena hunts down her cloned twin. The characters are realistic and well detailed with intense emotions. This novella moves propulsively, violating taboos , and ends with an explosion of a denouement, both challenging and fulfilling.\n\nPeople Like Us • (1989) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nAverage. Two very different classes of society meet for dinner … and one of them brings an alien.\n\nEvolution • (1995) • novelette by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. Antibiotic-immune diseases are making hospitals no-go zones. Mix in family dynamics, anti-science terrorism, and really well written characters. This is a very good story. And has quite a bit of resonance as I read it for the first time in 2020.\n\nMargin of Error • (1994) • short story by Nancy Kress\n\nGood. A genetically perfect woman comes to try to get her sister to rejoin a genetic experiment that has started to break apart at the 12 generation. She believes that her sister will leave her lower class life of children. Instead of help, she finds subtle vengeance.\n\nBeggars in Spain • [Sleepless] • (1991) • novella by Nancy Kress\n\nGreat. Children are altered to be born without the need for sleep and have a huge advantage over those who do. Society’s reaction is violent. This is Kress’ masterpiece and a challenging story about the inequalities of birth, status, wealth, and more. It is also a haunting look into a possible future."
