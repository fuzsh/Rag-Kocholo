        "text": "This post is about the original 1991 novella, and not the expanded novel that was published in 1993. Yes, this one, with the terrible cover:\n\nI read Beggars in Spain for last year’s SciFiMonth Friday Five topic ‘Upgrade Me’ because I haven’t encountered a lot of transhuman science fiction (or I don’t remember it if I have) and Nancy Kress wrote one of my teenage self’s favourite books, An Alien Light, but I hadn’t read anything else by her.\n\nKress’ premise is a simple one: In the near future genetic modification is used to tweak a small group of babies so that they will never need to sleep. The ‘Sleepless’ children produced are smarter, more emotionally balanced, healthier and more productive than their ‘Sleeper’ counterparts, and as they grow up they are hated for their difference.\n\nAlongside this development, a brilliant scientist called Kenzo Yagai (creator of the Y-Energy that enables cheap power to be readily available, thus ushering in wider spread prosperity), is growing in popularity for his philosophy, Yagaiism. The key principle of Yagaiism is that a person’s dignity rests upon their productivity and their freedom to trade with others, suggesting that “the basic tool of civilisation is contracts” between individuals: trading what they do well for what someone else does well. The B-side to this is that if a person is not productive, whether because they cannot or don’t want to, they are owed nothing.\n\nThe novella then explores this idea through the rising tensions between Sleepers and Sleepless.\n\nThe Sleepless are represented, primarily, by Leisha, whose parents we meet in the opening chapter. Roger and Elizabeth Camden are on opposite sides of the decision to have Leisha modified, Roger very much for giving his unborn baby daughter every advantage, and Elizabeth against it. When they discover that they are having twins, one tweaked and one not, they each focus on their chosen child. Leisha’s sister, Alice, grows up alongside her, all but ignored by their father, while their mother, who pays her more attention but also drinks increasingly heavily, eventually moves out.\n\nUntil she’s fifteen, Leisha’s closest relationship is with her father, who challenges her to become the best she can be and delights in her intelligence. When she learns that there are others like her she seeks them out: first, seventeen-year-old Richard Keller, and then through him, a group of Sleepless all of a similar age who become her friends. Each of them hides the fact that they’re Sleepless from others so as not to be prevented from achieving or competing in their chosen interests, or, in one boy’s case, on his mom’s orders, so that the rest of his family and friends don’t find out he’s “a freak”. The group become close through this mutual understanding and speculate on how the world will change in reaction to their existence.\n\nLeisha thinks her friends are paranoid when they suggest that in the future they will be discriminated against because of their natural advantages, but her experiences while at Harvard imply otherwise. While Leisha ends up in a secure apartment with a bodyguard to accompany her everywhere, she still holds a determinedly positive view, believing that prejudice will only come from a minority and that society will ultimately see the value in their Sleepless members:\n\n“Sleepless are making real and concrete contributions to society, in a lot of fields. That has to outweigh the discomfort we cause. We’re valuable to you.”\n\nBut one of her fellow Sleepless, Tony, asks a more pertinent question: what do the Sleepless owe to the Sleepers, if anything? Even if they acknowledge the value of the Sleepless, the Sleepers are the less productive (less ‘valuable’) ones, and as per Yagaiism they are owed nothing – the Sleepless need not share their knowledge, wealth and resources with them. From this standpoint, he begins to build Sanctuary, a protected place for the community of Sleepless to retreat to in the face of mounting anti-Sleepless feeling.\n\nThe end of the novella finally sees Leisha’s counterargument coalesce when she and Alice (and a small group of other Sleeper friends Leisha has made) set out to rescue a Sleepless child who is being abused by her parents. Leisha concludes that society isn’t built on linear transactions alone, but on an “ecology of trade” and an “ecology of help”. Just because a person has nothing to offer at the particular point in time that they need help, does not mean they will not be in a position to offer help in their turn at some future point. We all ‘trade’ with each other in an unending pattern of need and help.\n\nThere’s a lot more packed into the 152 pages of this story that I haven’t touched on. The character of Alice is due more attention than I’ve given her here, and so is the idea and reality (within the story) of Sanctuary. Parents abusing the very children that they chose to gift with sleeplessness. The hatred directed at the Sleepless, as individuals and as a group, which is so very like the hatred directed at far more powerless groups and communities throughout history, and what that says about our behaviour towards minorities. And how this can be challenged by diverse friendships, and by learning more about one another. There are bits and bobs that date this novella somewhat (hover cars, the datanet), but the story itself is a valuable one, particularly for the much-needed note of optimism that it finishes on. Highly recommended."
