That it never happens?\"\n\n\"It happens,\" Leisha said evenly. \"But not all that often.\"\n\n\"Bullshit. Read more history. Read more newspapers. But the point is: What do you owe the beggars then? What does a good Yagaiist who believes in mutually beneficial contracts do with people who have nothing to trade and can only take?\"\n\n\"You're not --\"\n\n\"What, Leisha? In the most objective terms you can manage, what do we owe the grasping and nonproductive needy?\"\n\n\"What I said originally. Kindness. Compassion.\"\n\n\"Even if they don't trade it back? Why?\"\n\n\"Because...\" She stopped.\n\n\"Why? Why do law-abiding and productive human beings owe anything to those who neither produce very much nor abide by just laws? What philosophical or economic or spiritual justification is there for owing them anything? Be as honest as I know you are.\"\n\nLeisha put her head between her knees. The question gaped beneath her, but she didn't try to evade it. \"I don't know. I just know we do.\""
