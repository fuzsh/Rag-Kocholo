        "text": "Won't you say? Will you tell?\n\nWarning! Look down to view spoilers.\n\n\"Look Down\" (sometimes referred to as \"Paris: 1832\", or as \"The Beggars\" in the School Edition) involves one of the best known musical themes in the musical, imitating that which is first heard in the Work Song. It is important for the plot, introducing Gavroche, Enjolras, Marius, and the plight of the working poor. It also re-introduces the Thénardiers and their now grown-up daughter Éponine, who have lost their inn and have become destitute, and now resorted to a full crime. This song flows directly into \"The Robbery.\"\n\nThe song is known as \"Donnez, donnez\" in the original French production, \"Bonjour Paris\" in the 1991 Paris revival, \"París/Piedad\" in the Spanish production, \"Schaut her\" in the German production and \"Omlaag\" in the Dutch production.\n\nThe lyrics were written by Herbert Kretzmer. In some versions Gavroche introduces Éponine by singing 'That's Éponine, she knows her wayabout, only a kid, but hard to scare. Do we care? Not a cuss. Long live us. Long live us!\"\n\nLyrics[]\n\nLyrics [10th Anniversary Concert][]\n\nSecond Broadway Revival Lyrics[]\n\nBeggars:\n\nLook down and see the beggars at your feet\n\nLook down and show some mercy if you can\n\nLook down and see the sweepings of the street\n\nLook down, look down, upon your fellow man\n\nGavroche:\n\nHow do you do?
