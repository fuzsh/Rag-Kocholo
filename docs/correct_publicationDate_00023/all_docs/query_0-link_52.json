        "text": "In a world where the slightest edge can mean the difference between success and failure, Leisha Camden is beautiful, extraordinarily intelligent ... and one of an ever-growing number of human beings who have been genetically modified to never require sleep.\n\nOnce considered interesting anomalies, now Leisha and the other \"Sleepless\" are outcasts -- victims of blind hatred, political repression, and shocking mob violence meant to drive them from human society ... and, ultimately, from Earth itself.\n\nBut Leisha Camden has chosen to remain behind in a world that envies and fears her \"gift\" -- a world marked for destruction in a devastating conspiracy of freedom ... and revenge."
