        "text": "Amazon Barnes and Noble Kobo\n\nCover illustration by Tom Canty.\n\nNancy Kress, winner of multiple awards for her science fiction and fantasy, ranges through space and time in this stunning collection. Anne Boleyn is snatched from her time stream—with unexpected consequences for two worlds. A far-future spaceship brings religion to a planet that already harbors shocking natives. People genetically engineered to never need to sleep clash with those who do. A scientific expedition to the center of the galaxy discovers more than anyone bargained for. A woman finds that “people like us” does not mean what she thinks it does.\n\nPraised for both her hard SF and her complex characters, Nancy Kress brings a unique viewpoint to twenty-one stories, the best of a long and varied career that has won her five Nebulas, two Hugos, a Sturgeon, and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award.\n\nFrom Locus:\n\n“Another candidate for the title of best collection of the year, in a year that’s turning out to be very strong for short-story collections, is The Best of Nancy Kress… worth it for the extensive amount of really first-class fiction you get, including several Hugo and Nebula Award winners.”\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\n“The much-lauded talents of SF and fantasy writer Kress (Yesterday’s Kin) are finely showcased in this sparkling and thoughtful collection of 21 short stories… Kress has a gift for focusing on the familiar and the personal, even in the most alien settings. This collection will fire the imaginations of new readers and longtime fans alike.”\n\nTable of Contents:"
