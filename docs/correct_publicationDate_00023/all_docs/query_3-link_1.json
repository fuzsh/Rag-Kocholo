        "text": "Pub Date January 10, 2023\n\nPre-order now!\n\nAmazon / Barnes & Noble / Powell’s\n\nDr. Caroline Soames-Watkins’s star has been on the rise. But when she accuses a superior of sexual misconduct, a Twitterstorm results that upends her career. With few professional options, and an impoverished sister with a profoundly disabled child to support, Caro is willing to consider a strange and unexpected proposal from her great-uncle, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Samuel Watkins.\n\nThe elder Watkins changed the world and made his fortune after patenting an over-the-counter cure for the common cold. He has since invested untold sums of money to build a medical facility in the Caribbean. Sam Watkins is sickly and in urgent need of a surgeon to perform a unique procedure developed at his island compound. But the procedure isn’t to cure the cancer surely killing him, it is meant to offer new life of a truer kind.\n\nHelped in his mission by the eminent physicist George Weigert and the young tech entrepreneur Julian Dey, Sam Watkins has gone far beyond curing the body to develop a technology that could solve the riddle of mortality for the soul. Caro understands that the brain-mapping work being done on the island has great scientific value, but she refuses to grant Weigert’s other claims, which seem outlandish to her. However, enticed by the chance to secure financial stability for her family, she puts aside her profound misgivings, and joins a mission she can’t bring herself to believe.\n\nShe never expects that her choice will lead her into so much danger—or into love."
