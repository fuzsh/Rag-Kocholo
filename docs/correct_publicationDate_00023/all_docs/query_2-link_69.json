        "text": "I can confidently say that today has been the most amazing day of my life. As I climbed through the Sierra Nevada Mountains, I saw a side of nature I have never seen before: a mother cow protecting its calf, a spring starting from the top of a mountain and flowing through waterfalls, mountains stretching above clouds. The feeling of being on top of the mountain was so surreal. There was no tour guide, no one to tell you which way to go, no one to tell you if you were climbing the right way. We were on our own. I was on my own. As afraid as I was being so high up, it was empowering feeling to be in such a vulnerable physical state. And yet, it was all worth it. The view from atop the mountains is one I can’t explain and a view that no picture could fully capture. The only people that know just how amazing today was are the people who experienced it with me which I think helped bring us closer as a group.\n\nI have just returned from a day at the beach, and besides the sunburn, it was an amazing day! We took a bus to Nerja where, after asking many locals, we finally found the beach. Sometimes, being in Granada can be a little hectic with the crowded streets (especially the week with Corpus Christi), classes, homework, and the several excursions. At the beach, I was able to lay down with an incredible view and not worry about a thing. It was the relaxing day I needed after a packed two weeks. I was so amazed by the scenery that surrounded us: the crystal clear Mediterranean Sea on one side and the Sierra Nevada mountains on the other. This day has made me so excited for our excursion on Sunday but hopefully my sunburn goes away by then!\n\nAfter spending less than 24 hours in Madrid, we are on our bus ride back to Granada. Although sore and extremely tired, I had such an amazing day! Today we visited El Museo Del Prado, and although art is not one of my top interests, I was truly amazed by the talent of the countless artists featured in the museum and how well all of the artwork had been preserved. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how the Spanish artwork complimented the history we have learned in class. For instance, the painting below captures the moment when the Inquisitor Torquemada accused Isabel and Fernando of selling Christ for considering a financial offer from a representative of the Jewish community rather than expelling the Jews. In the painting, we see the words “TANTO MONTA”, which refers to how Isabel and Fernando tried to represent themselves as equal although this is clearly not the case and Isabel was the true ruler. After our trip to the museum, we visited a park and went inside a Crystal Palace, something I have never seen before. I am so happy we were able to plan and execute this short yet incredible trip!\n\nWe have made it to Madrid! Although extremely exhausted after a four and a half hour bus ride, I am feeling extremely proud of myself. We managed to plan this excursion and all of its detailed independently and in a limited amount of time. Furthermore, I think it was important to experience another aspect of Spain, an aspect that is not portrayed in Grenada. For instance, when we were on the subway on our way to the hostel, Rachael was holding on to the pole with Gen when a man on the subway reached into her purse. Luckily, Amanda saw this happening and the man stopped. A few minutes lair, the man tried to reach into the purse of a woman standing next to us but she simply slapped his hand away and seemed unfazed. For the seven of us, it was an eye opening experience because we were not used to this aggression in the US or in Grenada, but after the man had gotten off the subway, the woman told us that this was very common in the city so we must always be aware of our surroundings. Also, in Grenada, we are used to seeing beggars on the street; however, we do not necessarily know if these beggars are in fact homeless. In Madrid, it was very sad to see the countless homeless people sleeping on the streets with all of their belongings tucked next to them. Tonight truly helped me to appreciate Grenada and its safe and comfortable environment.\n\nI had such a great time on today’s excursion! I was so impressed with all of the architecture of the city’s historical monuments. I found it interesting how the buildings had architectural features from the 15th century and how the architecture changed with the addition of new parts. Furthermore, the Castilla Royal has so much history and yet, when the King visits Sevilla he still stays in the palace which is amazing! I loved climbing the tower and having the opportunity to overlook the beautiful city. I wish we had more time to explore the city’s beauty because the city has so much history and magnificent detail in all of its architecture. I would love to visit Sevilla again in the future.\n\nHola from Spain! I have been here for less than a week and already feel accustomed to the Spanish way of life. I enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and how the schedule is later compared to that of the United States–people wake up later, eat later, and stay out later. I found the tours extremely helpful in learning my way around Grenada and to learn about areas that are good for shopping, eating, etc. Today we even went back to the area toured during the second tour to go shopping and walk around. My favorite part of the week was visiting the vineyard because it was an interactive excursion and yet we also became familiar with a large part of the Spanish culture on a deeper level."
