        "text": "Read first time in 1992\n\nThis novel was the first for me to learn about the up and coming Internet. When at me 22 years, the sleepless factor resonated an urge to identify with those adolescents that were thrust upon each other in such a hearty manner that offered an avenue to understand that Yagiism.\n\nThe Yagiism didn't matter much to me. I guess its because, Nance Kress is such the wordsmith that she can write on many levels to attract all interested readers.\n\nI began to adore the concept of 'the dragon' more through her writings than with any other other author.\n\nMy first Nancy Kress story...\n\n...and I really enjoyed it. I know she is very thorough about her science and assumptions. I really enjoyed the hard science while keeping the humanity element throughout.\n\nAward-Winning Sci Fi\n\nThe narrator is quite good, but the muscial & sound-effect interludes can be distracting. The novella is excellent and thought-provoking."
