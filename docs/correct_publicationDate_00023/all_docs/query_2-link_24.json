        "text": "Similar to Egan in what way?\n\nI suspect you probably mean the \"Hard SF\" (rigorous extrapolation of current scientific knowledge) aspect of the writing with perhaps a detached narrative style.\n\nNo one I know is like Greg Egan except Greg Egan; he's, IMO, the best \"Hard SF\" exponent currently writing. There are other writers who people regard to be \"Hard SF\". Maybe you could try a few of them.\n\nThe Recommendation thread is a good place to start.\n\nWriters that are regarded as \"Hard SF\" (with Wikipedia links):\n\nHal Clement:\n\n\"MISSION OF GRAVITY\" is regarded as a Hard SF classic.\n\nStephen Baxter:\n\nHe came to prominence with \"THE TIME SHIPS\", a sequel to H.G. Wells \"THE TIME MACHINE\" but has been writing some fine Hard SF. Try the first of his Manifold trilogy, \"MANIFOLD: TIME\" or the XEELEE SEQUENCE starting with \"RAFT\".\n\nGreg Bear:\n\n\"BLOOD MUSIC\"\n\nCharles Sheffield:\n\n\"THE WEB BETWEEN WORLDS\" and \"BETWEEN THE STROKES OF NIGHT\". He wrote my favourite novelette, \"GEORGIA ON MY MIND\".\n\nDavid Brin:\n\n\"EARTH\" is an excellent stand-alone. He's best known for his \"UPLIFT\" series.\n\nNancy Kress:\n\nAnother excellent writer. She explores more the impact of molecular biology (genetic engineering) rather than physical sciences. Try the series that starts with \"BEGGARS IN SPAIN\".\n\nKim Stanley Robinson:\n\nThe \"MARS\" trilogy, starting with \"RED MARS\" is about human exploration & colonisation of Mars.\n\nVernor Vinge:\n\n\"A FIRE UPON THE DEEP\" & \"A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY\". He's also brilliant.\n\nCharles Stross:\n\nMy current favourite SF writer. His recent novel \"ACCELERANDO\" traces the lives of three generations of a family as they live through a technological singularity. \"ACCELERANDO\" is available as a free download.\n\nThe SF part of sffworld needs a \"If you like ^^^^^ then you might like #####\" thread.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWas just informed that there is a Sci-fi: If you like ^^^ then you might like ### thread after all. Thanks to monty mike!\n\nDoes this help?\n\nThank you very much for your answers. In fact, I've already read some of the authors you have proposed (Charles Sheffield, Vinge, Greg Bear) and I have most of the others (Erath, Red Mars, Beggars in Spain...) in my shelves waiting to be read (so many books, so little time...). But I don't think that any of them (at least the ones I've read) are exactly what I'm looking for, though I like them all.\n\nIn fact, I'm not referring only to hard SF, but specially to that kind of hard SF which is deeply linked with philosophical speculation. I think that Egan is a master in that (and I agree that he is one of the best SF writers nowadays). For instance, in his novels and stories he deals with many important and deep questions: What is the conscience? What is it to be human? What is reality? All these problems are addressed by means of concepts and ideas from modern science (quantum physics, for example) and are explored thoroughly. I love that!!! And I have found no other author (with the only exception of Ted Chiang, possibly) which deals at the same time with borderlands of science and the implications to modern philosophy. That's what I'm looking for!!!\n\nIn the \"what it means to be human\" mode, definitely check out \"Accelerando\". With the ability to upload 'yourself' and spawn multiple copies, who is 'you\"?, is just one of the themes explored.\n\nThe John C. Wright trilogy is also an excellent exploration of the 'identity' theme.\n\nI also really liked Tony Daniel's \"Metaplanetary\", which has 'large arrays of personalities' or entities that are an aggregation of different personalities. Unfortunately, the publishers has declined to print the conclusion to that trilogy.\n\nWith the Ted Chiang collection & Greg Egan, you're basically reading the best exponents of this sort of writing. You are not going to get more of the same unless they clone themselves\n\nThere are other writers who are, IMHO, 'as good', but for different reasons.\n\nTrouble is when you've read writers this good, it's hard to go back to the 'lesser' stuff.\n\nArchren said:\n\nIn the deep philsophical speculation mode, you might enjoy the \"Golden Age\" trilogy by John C. Wright, which starts with the book \"The Golden Age.\" It is really an amazing piece of work, almost entirely hard SF, very far-future, very concerned with philosophy and questions of identity. Try it, I think you might like it.\n\nSure! How could I forget about John C. Wright? I have read \"The golden age\" and I was very surprised by the way he introduces philosophical problems (specially, as you said, that of identity) and also genuine sense of wonder. Very, very good I have the two other volumes of the reilogy in the to-read stack\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nIn the \"what it means to be human\" mode, definitely check out \"Accelerando\". With the ability to upload 'yourself' and spawn multiple copies, who is 'you\"?, is just one of the themes explored.\n\nI have heard great things about this book and though I didn't like much \"Singularity Sky\" I'm really looking forward to reading it. It is not in paperback yet, but I don't know if I will be able to wait...\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nThe John C. Wright trilogy is also an excellent exploration of the 'identity' theme.\n\nI agree\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nI also really liked Tony Daniel's \"Metaplanetary\", which has 'large arrays of personalities' or entities that are an aggregation of different personalities. Unfortunately, the publishers has declined to print the conclusion to that trilogy.\n\nI didn't know about this one. I will give it a look.\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nWith the Ted Chiang collection & Greg Egan, you're basically reading the best exponents of this sort of writing.\n\nYeah, they are great writers to me. It is a pity that Chiang is not more prolific.\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nYou are not going to get more of the same unless they clone themselves\n\nWell, in fact it would be more appropiate if the make multiple digital copies of themselves\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nThere are other writers who are, IMHO, 'as good', but for different reasons.\n\nTrouble is when you've read writers this good, it's hard to go back to the 'lesser' stuff.\n\nSure, but I think that nowadays there are many other very good SF writers. For instance, I really like Alastair Reynolds, Robert Reed and Peter F. Hamilton.\n\nodo said:\n\nI have heard great things about this book and though I didn't like much \"Singularity Sky\" I'm really looking forward to reading it. It is not in paperback yet, but I don't know if I will be able to wait...\n\nYou do know that Accelerando is available as a free download under the Creative Commons License? You can find it here.\n\nodo said:\n\nYeah, they are great writers to me. It is a pity that Chiang is not more prolific.\n\nI suspect that if he take didn't as long as he does perfecting each story, they wouldn't be the same.\n\nodo said:\n\nSure, but I think that nowadays there are many other very good SF writers. For instance, I really like Alastair Reynolds, Robert Reed and Peter F. Hamilton.\n\nAgreed. That's what I meant by writers that are 'as good' but 'different'.\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nYou do know that Accelerando is available as a free download under the Creative Commons License? You can find it here.\n\nYeah, I know, thank you. In fact I have already downloaded it. I will read the beginning just to know whether I like it or not, but eventually I'll buy it. I don't like much reading in the computer\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nI suspect that if he take didn't as long as he does perfecting each story, they wouldn't be the same.\n\nSure, but Egan produces stories that are as good (or better) and he publishes much more.\n\nSoon Lee said:\n\nAgreed. That's what I meant by writers that are 'as good' but 'different'.\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nIn fact I think that we are living a good time for SF. Since I began reading in English (about one year ago) I discovered lots of very good authors which have not been translated into Spanish yet. And I have a long list of new (at least to me) authors which I want to read: Linda Nagata, Karl Schroeder, Wil McCarthy..."
