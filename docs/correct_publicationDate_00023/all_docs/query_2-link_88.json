        "text": "In the 20 years since Robert Redford's \"Quiz Show\" first hit theaters, the pervasive and insidious nature of television--one of the key themes of this picture--has become even more problematic, as evidenced by the proliferation of lowest-common-denominator entertainment abundant across the airwaves and the increased focus on \"infotainment\" over hard news and contrived verite style (a ka reality TV) over quality writing. These were among the conclusions reached by our group following its discussion of this movie. Here's a recap:\n\nWHAT IS DIFFERENT AND DISTINGUISHABLE ABOUT QUIZ SHOW THAT SURPRISED YOU?\n\n· The plot is relatively simple and devoid of much action, although there is plenty of conflict.\n\n· The film feels exceptionally well cast, especially in even the smallest roles, where even bit parts shine with resonance.\n\n· Most docudramas based on real-life past events change names and facts; while “Quiz Show” is not completely historically accurate in its retelling of the quiz show scandal, it does name real names of the people involved, including the TV execs, the network (NBC), and even the sponsor (Geritol).\n\n· The movie doesn’t attempt to answer every question related to this scandal, the most prominent one being: what tempted Van Doren to cheat?\n\nCAN YOU NAME ANY SIGNIFICANT THEMES EXPLORED IN “QUIZ SHOW”?\n\n· It asks the question: What would you do if someone asked you to lie in exchange for money and fame?\n\n· The dangers of being misled by seductive temptations, whether it be a game show contestant agreeing to cheat, TV viewers being fooled but still wanting to watch even when told the truth, or the young man who is intrigued by the trappings of the shiny new Chrysler.\n\n· The moral compromises people make, even those who claim to take the moral high ground: consider how Goodwin, who vows to expose and prosecute the quiz show perpetrators, goes easy on Van Doren. Why? Perhaps it’s a reflection of his desire to protect someone of his own class more than an eagerness to bring down the real culprits (TV execs).\n\n· The rich get richer and the small man gets the blame: Consider how the only quiz show scandal offender that walks away unpunished is television itself; the fat cat TV executives are acquitted, and even the lower-level suit gets his job back and returns to programming. Meanwhile, Van Doren and Stempel have to wear their badge of shame for the rest of their lives.\n\n· The contrast between the allure and easiness associated with cheating (as seen in Van Doren’s privileged lifestyle) versus the frustration and hard work of investigation (exemplified by the pavement-pounding Goodwin).\n\nALTHOUGH IT’S SET IN THE 1950s, AND MUCH HAS CHANGED IN POPULAR CULTURE AND SOCIETY SINCE THEN, HOW IS QUIZ SHOW STILL RELEVANT AND TOPICAL?\n\n· It conveys the dark message that we’re still a gullible society of consumers who are drawn to the allure of television, a very dishonest, manipulative medium that promotes celebrity, cosmetic beauty, immediate gratification and entertainment over truth and veracity.\n\n· While it points the finger at the individual perpetrators (Van Doren, Enright, Stempel, etc.), Quiz Show reminds us that the medium of TV is even more reprehensible and blame-worthy.\n\n· Its themes are echoed in today’s vapid television choices, most of which are dominated by reality TV programs that also appear as authentic, unaltered reflections of real life but which are also rigged with contrived situations and people selected by central casting.\n\n· It suggests a timeless message and universal question: Is it wrong to cheat? And when is cheating ever acceptable?\n\n· Redford aimed to depict the cultural moment when America lost its innocence, claiming that the quiz show scandal was that moment, taking place in the Eisenhower era when people had faith in politicians and in what they saw and read in the media; yet, it feels like we’re continually losing our innocence all over again with each new transgression made by popular entertainment (e.g., the transition from hard news programming to “infotainment,” the blurring between documentary style realism and fabricated fake reality TV, the lowering of standards related to violence and sex on TV and in movies, etc.).\n\n· Roger Ebert summed it up well when he said, in his review of this film: “Take stock of what we have lost in the four decades since \"Twenty-One\" came crashing down. We have lost a respect for intelligence; we reward people for whatever they happen to have learned, instead of feeling they might learn more. We have forgotten that the end does not justify the means - especially when the end is a high TV rating or any other kind of popular success. And we have lost a certain innocent idealism.”\n\nDOES THIS FILM REMIND YOU OF ANY OTHERS?\n\n· Pleasantville\n\n· Good Night, and Good Luck\n\n· Network\n\n· The Truman Show\n\n· Slumdog Millionaire\n\nOTHER FILMS DIRECTED BY ROBERT REDFORD\n\n· Ordinary People\n\n· The Milagro Beanfield War\n\n· A River Runs Through It\n\n· The Horse Whisperer\n\nRead more...\n\nThere's a lot to admire within \"As Good as it Gets,\" a film that holds up 17 years after its theatrical release with quirky but plausible characters, sharp and smart dialogue, and performances that live up to the movie's title. Here's what we collectively learned about this picture after hashing out the fine points last evening at CineVerse:\n\nWHAT IS SURPRISING ABOUT “AS GOOD AS IT GETS” AND DEFIES EXPECTATIONS?\n\n· The unexpected chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt, who is 26 years younger than the former and who make an unlikely romantic pair, despite their personality differences and age disparity. Hunt, although primarily known as a TV actress in 1997, is impressive and holds her own with a heavyweight like Nicholson, as evidenced by her spirited reactions to his behaviors.\n\n· The things that Udall says and does are decidedly politically incorrect and insensitive, which risk upsetting minority viewers; just 17 years later, gay bashing and lampooning has become much less tolerated.\n\n· The film feels ideally cast with the exact right actor for each part; this, despite the fact that the careers of Hunt, Kinnear and Gooding Jr. quickly went south in the years after this film was released.\n\n· It cleverly brings together several uniquely different characters—who each have nothing in common and live extremely different lifestyles—for a road movie that somehow gels. That all three learn to harmonize together and become friends says a lot about the message of this picture.\n\n· It’s also one of the rare feature films to tackle the topic of obsessive compulsive disorder and how problematic and disabling it can be to sufferers—although it’s approached in a more comic vein.\n\nTHEMES TO BE MINED FROM THIS MOVIE\n\n· Salvation: Udall is such an abrasive, despicable character that, unless he can be redeemed somehow and shown in a sympathetic light, this film fails to connect with audiences.\n\n· The redemptive power of love: Udall can’t be redeemed, however, without the love of a good woman, in the form of Carol, who seems to be the unlikeliest of candidates to give him affection.\n\n· Opposites attract: As aforementioned, each of the three main characters shares virtually no commonality with each other; Udall is an obsessive-compulsive bigoted writer; Carol is a single mother starving for romance and attention; and Simon is an artistic gay man who has suffered a physical attack and gone broke.\n\n· Our interconnectedness as human beings, regardless of differences. Each of the 3 main characters has distinctive flaws and problems, yet each can and does help each other.\n\n· Surrogate parenting: this is less of a love triangle (considering that Simon is gay) than a surrogate parental relationship, in which Melvin is the gruff and insensitive yet generous patriarch and Carol is the sensitive, caring matriarch to Simon, who seeks out this surrogate guidance from others because his real parents have rejected him.\n\nWHY IS NICHOLSON THE IDEAL CASTING CHOICE FOR MELVIN UDALL?\n\n· As written, the character has a very offensive, repellant, seemingly incurable personality that makes it very hard to root for him.\n\n· Yet, Nicholson has proved to be a crowd-pleasing, lovable sinner in many memorable roles prior to this, and his devilish grin, arched eyebrows, body language and unique voice and manner of delivery are irresistible.\n\n· Thus, his talent and magnetism causes us to trust that the character will have some redemptive arc, Good Samaritan turn or epiphany that will reward our faith in him.\n\n· Also, Nicholson is too good an actor to allow Udall’s conversion from jerk to lovable and compassionate misanthrope to be too silly, overly sentimental or sappy.\n\nOTHER FILMS DIRECTED BY JAMES L.

Here's the CineVerse group consensus on this 25-year-old gem from 1989:\n\nHOW IS THIS FILM INTERESTING, DIFFERENT, DISTINCTIVE AND SURPRISING, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS GENRE (DRAMA) AND SUBJECT MATTER (RACE RELATIONS)?\n\n·It’s very slow moving in plot, tone, direction and character action; it relies on subtlety, in the form of the actors’ nuanced performances and carefully crafted but sparse dialogue, to tell its story.\n\n·Consider the supposed lack of box-office appeal elements involved: this is a quiet, slow-moving film about two complete opposites—a middle-aged African American servant and a senior citizen Jewish woman; there is no sex or romantic subplot; very little action occurs. Considering these factors, it’s somewhat of a miracle that the film was a box-office success and winner of the Best Picture Academy Award.\n\n·It traces this special relationship over 25 years, showing an arc of development between two characters that is affected by cultural and sociological changes and the effects of aging.\n\n·It’s not heavy-handed, over-sentimental or ham-fisted in its messages or ideas. This could have, for example, been much more of a polemic on inherent racism in the South, or unfair class divisions, and painted everyone around Hoke and Daisy as either bigoted and villainous or victimized and exploited. Instead of being racially and politically overcharged, this picture is much more restrained and introspective of its characters.\n\nHOW DOES THIS MOVIE AVOID BEING TOO RACIALLY INSENSITIVE, CONSIDERING THE SETUP—A BLACK MAN SERVING A WEALTHY OLD WHITE WOMAN?\n\n·Each character represents a minority—Hoke an African American and Daisy a Jew.\n\n·Each character is dependent on and subservient to the other—Hoke depends on Daisy for employment and must do her bidding as a chauffeur, but Daisy is equally dependent on Hoke, as she cannot drive, and later, we even see Hoke feed her as she cannot do so herself.\n\n·Each character also harbors his/her own racial prejudices, although these attitudes improve by the story’s end.\n\n·Daisy is also not the stereotypical white female “master” character you’d expect for this time and setting; ironically, she is a Jewish liberal living in the South, a region of systemic racism, conservative politics and Christian beliefs.\n\n·We see that both characters are victims of prejudice, as Daisy’s temple is bombed and she is referred to as an “old Jew woman” by the traffic cops, who also call Hoke the “N” word.\n\n·As reviewer Peter Rainer put in his write-up for the L.A. Times, “their mellowing relationship is meant to mirror the growth of civil rights in the South. Daisy is Jewish, so the movie is structured as a tale of two outcasts bonded by their stubborn pride.”\n\n·Also, despite the fact that Hoke is her chauffeur employee throughout most of the film, “Driving Miss Daisy is the story of the servant who is so faithful and selfless that he ceases to be a servant and becomes a friend…it suggests that the real rewards of servitude aren’t financial but emotional, and thus that the served need feel no guilt,” wrote critic Dave Kehr.\n\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE PRIMARY THEMES AND MESSAGES ESPOUSED IN “DRIVING MISS DAISY”?\n\n·The attraction of opposites—in this context, not a romantic attraction, but a Platonic camaraderie attraction.\n\n·The capacity for deep friendship to outlast the passing of time, the decline of the mind and body, racial insensitivity or social status.\n\n·The ability of peoples, cultures, and societies to change, evolve and progress over time, as these characters and the people and places around them changed after the civil rights movement.\n\n·We must overcome our intrinsic and instinctive bigotries and narrow-mindedness in order to foster invaluable friendships and relationships with other people and grow as a society.\n\n·The aged and disabled are deserving of our love, care and respect.\n\nHAS THIS FILM AGED WELL AND GRACEFULLY, LOOKING AT IT 25 YEARS LATER, OR ARE WE SO CONDITIONED BY FASTER-PACED MOVIES TODAY THAT IT’S A HARDER SIT-THROUGH TODAY WITH ITS LEISURELY PACING AND THREADBARE PLOT?\n\nOTHER FILMS DIRECTED BY BRUCE BERESFORD\n\n·Breaker Morant\n\n·Tender Mercies\n\n·Crimes of the Heart\n\nRead more..."
