        "text": "Casper is a 1995 American fantasy comedy film directed by Brad Silberling, in his feature directorial debut, based on the Harvey Comics cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost created by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo. The film stars Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, Eric Idle, and Amy Brenneman, and also features the voices of Malachi Pearson in the title role as well as Joe Nipote, Joe Alaskey, and Brad Garrett.\n\nThe film makes extensive use of computer-generated imagery to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a much darker interpretation of the Friendly Ghost in comparison to the comics, cartoons, and films of the previous years, especially with its theme of death, most notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.\n\nCasper was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995, by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its faithfulness to its source material (specifically the title character's portrayal), visual effects, music score, and performances, but criticized its dark story and humor. The film earned $287.9 million[1] on a $55 million[1] budget, and went on to spawn direct-to-video follow-up films and an animated television spin-off, The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn Friendship, Maine, following the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor in his will while his vast wealth has gone to several charities. Carrigan and her assistant, Dibs, find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, but find the property haunted by a ghost named Casper and his poltergeist uncles, the Ghostly Trio, and unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. A lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning Dr. Harvey to Whipstaff. Harvey and Kat are estranged due to his reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails.\n\nCasper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party. Her envious classmate Amber plots with her boyfriend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who not only try to avoid them, but also reveal they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to go through the \"red tape\" involved to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.\n\nKat learns Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden sled his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of pneumonia, becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside, steal the formula that powers the Lazarus, and plot to use the machine, believing it could grant them immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure they think is in the basement's locked vault; Carrigan falls off a cliff to her death, and rises as a ghost.\n\nDr. Harvey becomes despondent after the trio prank him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after a drunken Harvey declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death down a manhole.\n\nIn the laboratory, Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. Casper and Kat trick Carrigan into saying that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing her to eject herself into the afterlife. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by Duke Snider; the so-called map was part of a game Casper played with his father (and thus Carrigan would've been furious at having gone through all that trouble for nothing). Dr. Harvey, now a ghost, returns with Casper's uncles, and Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring her father instead.\n\nThe Halloween party kicks off upstairs; Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat, revealing it was Casper who had his wish granted by Amelia, now an angel. Amelia meets with Harvey and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business, and encourages him to move on, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise to find her for Harvey. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten and, after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, scaring off the guests. Kat is impressed with the party, which Harvey says is not over, cueing the Ghostly Trio to play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.\n\nCast[]\n\nMalachi Pearson as the voice of Casper McFadden, a lonely ghost, who was originally a 12-year-old boy who died of pneumonia.

He saw an episode of the television series Brooklyn Bridge directed by Brad Silberling and saw potential in this work, recruiting Silberling for directing Casper.[3] J. J. Abrams did an uncredited rewrite of the script.[4] The screenplay gave a backstory of Casper being the ghost of Casper McFadden, a boy who died of pneumonia at 12, though some of the comics, particularly in the 1960s, portrayed him as born a ghost to ghost parents.[5]\n\nExtensive use of computer-generated imagery is used to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in a leading role.[6] In the mirror scene, Dr. Harvey was also supposed to transform into Spielberg. According to director Silberling, the cameo was filmed, but was cut for pacing reasons. Spielberg was relieved, feeling that he is not much of an actor himself and was quite nervous in front of the camera.[7] Principal photography began on January 27, 1994, and ended on June 8, 1994.\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by award-winning composer James Horner, who had worked on a number of previous movies for Amblin Entertainment, including An American Tail and The Land Before Time.\n\nTemplate:Album ratings\n\n\"No Sign of Ghosts\"\n\n\"Carrigan and Dibbs\"\n\n\"Strangers in the House\"\n\n\"First Haunting/The Swordfight\"\n\n\"March of the Exorcists\"\n\n\"Lighthouse—Casper & Kat\"\n\n\"Casper Makes Breakfast\"\n\n\"Fond Memories\"\n\n\"'Dying' to Be a Ghost\"\n\n\"Casper's Lullaby\"\n\n\"Descent to Lazarus\"\n\n\"One Last Wish\"\n\n\"Same Song (Digital Underground song)\" – Digital Underground\n\n\"Remember Me This Way\" – Jordan Hill\n\n\"Casper the Friendly Ghost\" – Little Richard\n\n\"The Uncles Swing/End Credits\"\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nCasper opened at #1 over the Memorial Day weekend, grossing $16.8 million over its first three days from 2,714 theaters, averaging $6,205 per theater. Over four days it grossed $22.1 million, averaging $8,140 per theater. It stayed at #1 in its second weekend, grossing another $13.4 million, and boosting its 10-day cume to $38.9 million. It played solidly all through the summer, ending up with a final gross of $100.3 million in North America, and an additional $187.6 million internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $287.9 million, far exceeding its $55 million budget and becoming a commercial success.[1]\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nCasper received mixed to negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 47%, based on 38 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, \"A meandering, mindless family movie that frequently resorts to special effects and transparent sappiness.\"[8] Time Out London described it as \"an intimate and likeable film\".[9] Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it a \"technical achievement, it's impressive, and entertaining. And there is even a little winsome philosophy.\"[10] Robert Firsching of AllMovie gave the film his above average star rating while praising the film for its visual effects.\n\nThe CGI effects, which were considered cutting edge at the time, and the performances of Pullman and Ricci were praised, especially considering that, in the scenes where the Harveys interact with the ghosts, Pullman and Ricci were actually acting either with nothing or with stand-in maquettes used as animators' references.\n\nMoriarty's performance was criticized, with Variety saying she does \"a poor woman's Cruella de Vil\".[11] In his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a \"BOMB\" rating, objecting to the portrayal of Casper as a deceased child rather than a ghost.[12]\n\nAccolades[]\n\nThe film was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to Showgirls.[13]\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Template:Abbr Kids' Choice Awards May 11, 1996 Favorite Movie Casper Template:Nom Saturn Awards June 25, 1996 Best Performance by a Younger Actor Christina Ricci Template:Won Best Fantasy Film Casper Template:Nom Stinkers Bad Movie Awards 1996 Worst Picture Universal Pictures Template:Nom Young Artist Awards 1996 Best Performance by a Young Actor: Voiceover Role Malachi Pearson Template:Won Best Family Feature: Musical or Comedy Template:Nom Best Young Leading Actress: Feature Film Christina Ricci Template:Nom\n\nLegacy[]\n\nThe success of Casper secured Silberling the position of director for the 1998 City of Angels, a remake of Wings of Desire starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.[3]\n\nTV series[]\n\nA cartoon series, The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper, was released in 1996 based on the film.[14] Fatso (Season 1-2), Stinkie,[14] Stretch and Casper were all voiced by the actors from the film, while Dr. Harvey was voiced by Dan Castellaneta, and Kat voiced by Kath Soucie.\n\nSequel/Prequels[]\n\nHarvey Entertainment retained prequel rights to Casper.[15] Two direct-to-video follow-ups to the film were released by 20th Century Fox. An indirect prequel Casper: A Spirited Beginning was released in 1997,[16] and its sequel Casper Meets Wendy was released in 1998.[17]\n\nCancelled Sequel[]\n\nFollowing the release of Casper, Simon Wells co-wrote a screenplay for Casper 2, in which he was set to direct. However, in July 2000, it was reported that Universal Pictures had cancelled the sequel due to the disappointing sales from the direct-to-video Casper films and the hesitation of Christina Ricci.[18][19]\n\nVideo games[]"
