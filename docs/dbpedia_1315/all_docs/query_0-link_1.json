        "text": "This is a list of television programs currently or formerly broadcast by Cartoon Network in the United States. The network was launched on October 1, 1992, and airs mainly animated programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. In its early years, Cartoon Network's programming was predominantly made up of reruns of Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, and Hanna-Barbera shows (most notably Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw, The Flintstones, The Jetsons, and Jonny Quest).\n\nCartoon Network's first original series was The Moxy Show and the late-night satirical animated talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast. The What a Cartoon! series of showcase shorts brought the creation of many Cartoon Network original series collectives branded as \"Cartoon Cartoons\" in 1995. Cartoon Network has also broadcast several feature films, mostly animated or containing animated sequences, under its \"Cartoon Theater\" block, later renamed \"Flicks\".\n\nCurrent programming[]\n\nOriginal programming[]\n\nCartoon Network Studios[]\n\nTitle Premiere date Current season Note(s) Craig of the Creek March 30, 2018 5 [lower-alpha 1] We Baby Bears January 1, 2022 2 [lower-alpha 1][1][2][3]\n\nWarner Bros.
