        "text": "Been awhile, but a few years ago the original series was a big highlight for me!\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force, and much of the other shows from the Space Ghost branch showed the wonders of low budget + limited animation.\n\nA lot of those shows to me were much more captivating than the average mediocre strings of live action sitcoms.\n\nYour Pretty Face was a step up.\n\nDave Willis & Casper Kelly made an effort to compose a live action series with a similar creative approach as ATHF.\n\nIt all translated well! The effects and behind the scenes makeup work cannot go unpraised.\n\nBut now “Your Pretty Face” actually IS a cartoon!\n\nThe series trailer I saw before made this look much more promising than I expected it to be.\n\nI’ve given my thoughts on how the mini comeback season of ATHF was among the best they’ve ever done. I found all the right cues to still be intact even with the 3 minute time restraint.\n\nBut mind you, these are indeed classified as web shorts. I don’t believe that devalues the product in any way. Much of the hard work and crunch appears to still go into it as if the thing were to be televised.\n\nThat being said, how do I feel about the first YPF episode since 2019?\n\nIt’s about as childish and amusing as the original show.\n\n“Deaf boobs.”\n\nLove that Gary has a bit of a Stroker & Hoop type look to him now. Can’t say the art of the cartoon is bad or anything, looks very nice.\n\nWith the AquaDonk season, ATHF would absurdly wrap up an episode much like if it was 11-15 minutes.\n\nThis new episode however just kind of ends on that three minute note, and it’s more of an “okay” feeling.\n\nWe still have plenty more of these to go on. I don’t wanna say “man, this really should’ve been a new TV series for them instead.” Given how Adult Swim and WB have been recently.\n\nBut yeah. I don’t feel like the short runtime will always be that sweet.\n\nThe upside is that this method is MUCH more easier on the staff.\n\nThere was that one episode from the old show where near the end it cut to their actual offices in Georgia. Episode ended with the actors talking about how bad it is being lathered with all that red paint... in the heat for the entire day.\n\nI don’t know, this is something I think is good for a chuckle or two. Will support them regardless!\n\nOkay wow. So apparently they dumped 8 all at once lol. That’s different from how the AquaDonk season went.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/adultswim1\n\nI retract what I said before. Short format works out nice for this.\n\n^ Doesn’t look that much like Dana Snyder hahaha but I’ll take it.\n\n[Sexting]\n\nSo, I should elaborate a little more with the first episode.\n\nIt’s another example of Angel on one shoulder and a Demon on the other.\n\nGoing by the Heaven centered episode from the old show, the angels used to be the most care free and innocent happy-go-lucky characters.\n\nThis one felt like Stroker & Hoopish cartoon antics where the Angel was at more dumbfound odds with Gary.\n\nAnd then there’s the sexual humor, which is the biggest takeaway with this one. Like I said, it still gets a decent couple of laughs, but it’s one of the weakest from the batch.\n\n[Immortal Kombat]\n\nWith the second episode, you get a chance to see all the other main guys besides Gary.\n\nThis one tests out the new cartoon gore introduced to YPF... and for that reason it’s pretty good. Offers a little more in creativity compared to the one before.\n\n[Shoulder Pad Work]\n\nNow this one I feel is more in line with the original series.\n\nI immediately loved the beginning where both Eddie & Troy were eager to drink from Satan’s piss, and were additionally desperate to suck away at Satan’s feet just so they could watch the game on his nice TV.\n\nThe demons interfering with the players was also entertaining. The Raiders beer fridge death was another grand punishment from Darren Farley.\n\n[Crossroads]\n\nI’m sure this was also about close to an actual plot line from the old show that I’m forgetting, but yeah. They did a “deal with the Devil” episode that I enjoyed very much.\n\nThis has more of Adult Swim’s standard viewing of satanism humor that goes beyond YPF.\n\nIt’s about as fun in visuals as that second episode.\n\n*Side note, Gary, at least in this cartoon had died in 1993.*\n\n[The Thunderdevils]\n\nNow this is what defines YPF as a cartoon now.\n\n“Jeepies!”\n\nGary brainstorms a Thundercats parody where he’s the hero.\n\nThis felt almost exactly like how Stroker & Hoop would construct a parody, or tackle a cliche within the cartoon.\n\nThis is nothing TOO special. Tim Heidecker made a similar intentionally cheesy cartoon awhile back for Decker. And plenty of other Adult Swim shows have gone this route before.\n\nI guess it’s nice to see another one that’s more in line with both Stroker, and generally some of Casper’s miscellaneous work if that makes any sense.\n\nThe parody should’ve stopped here though.\n\n[The Thunderdevils: Episode Two]\n\nThis one I feel was the weakest.\n\nI’m old school. I’ve had to adapt to new ways of looking at things like everyone else.\n\nI’m not really that interested in stuff that tries jump at the younger crowd and outrage culture. I just don’t care.\n\nI’d rather laugh at jokes that are naturally funny instead of sulking about generations below me making things different. That stuff feels more grating than comedy.\n\nThe episode even does the type of jokes from my time that are like “Oh just cuz IM _____ I GOTTA” and that stuff got pretty damn annoying too.\n\nThe bit at the end with Gary & Eddie was cool. Can’t say I enjoyed anything else.\n\n[Ouroboros]\n\nA group exercise from Satan that is the demons rounded up as the Human Centipede. That’s about it. It’s good enough for what it’s going for.\n\n[Hell 2.0]\n\nThis one, like Thunderdevils 2 tries going over topical stuff that just doesn’t land.\n\nThe overall takeaway was Satan being frustrated with everyone’s ideas.\n\n****So yeah. A few are pretty nice, and a few I could go without. I think it’s still worth giving a try whether you were a casual fan of the original series or you just like Adult Swim.****"
