        "text": "I’m definitely nowhere near the first to echo this sentiment but… boy, was 2016 exhausting. There was a lot of good in the year just as there was a lot of bad, but oftentimes it really felt as if the latter outweighed the former by gargantuan amounts. If 2015 was the year in which I actually got a firm grip on the stability of my mental health, 2016 was the year that really challenged me and threatened to crumble me back down to ground zero. Besides a lot of a terrible news that affect millions as well as myself, I’ve been dealing with a whole bunch of personal struggles regarding my place in the world and general ability to get unstuck from my current stagnation. Basically, it’s everything one could expect from turning 25 in a new millennium.\n\nThankfully, I’ve always had movies and music to turn to during these dark times, even though I was literally inconsolable on my absolute worst days. I do think that the perspective on my consumption of films have changed since 2012 and 2013 – and even 2014 and 2015. I think back to the first day of class a couple summers ago, where we had to give our name and one interesting thing about ourselves, and I said that I had watched over 600 movies in the previous year to a flurry of gasps and impressed reactions. These days, though, my focus is more on not the amount of what I watch, but on how much I get out what I do watch. I did get around to filling in a lot of blind spots this past year and have generally enjoyed my movie-watching as a whole, but I’m still trying to chase down the breadth of wide-eyed discovery I achieved in 2013. There was so much pressure to fill up my personal quota this past year that I ended up watching some films that I may not have wanted to watch, but just felt that I had to, depending on each individual context. I know this seems blasphemous coming from someone who had just come off logging nearly 100 items in the month of December alone, but quality over quantity is a perspective that I definitely want to be more mindful of this coming year.\n\nWhich is why I want 2017 to be devoted to reading, watching, and listening to only the media I truly, madly, deeply want to indulge in. I still don’t know what compelled me to watch all of David O. Russell’s films in 2016, but the finish line wasn’t all that satisfying even though I knew it wouldn’t be. I want this year to be watching movies from artists I can truly appreciate – movies from women and people of color, horror movies, cult masterpieces, weird arthouse stuff, silent pictures, Christmas movies, cartoons, esoteric documentaries, rom-coms, wuxia film, dark comedies, sprawling landscape epics, 80s movies, action trash that are probably bad but still very fun – all that good stuff. Life is just too damn short to spend hours upon hours watching shit that you won’t remember a single thing about ten years later.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of my viewing experiences, however, came in the form of the #52FilmsByWomen challenge. I already tend to lean toward women-directed films in general, but having it in the form of a concrete number gave me all the more reason to spend two hours through a female perspective as opposed to all the male perspectives I inadvertently veer toward. Unsurprisingly I finished the challenge, and then some, accomplishing sixty-five women-made films in total. Outside of all the wonderful and not-so-wonderful qualities I attained from these films, I also realized that this challenge wasn’t really all that challenging at all. It didn’t really feel like I was going out of my way for an alternative viewpoint – I was just watching what I usually watch, which just so happens to mildly exceed the requirements of the challenge. So this next year, I’m going to up the ante by attempting to watch 100 films directed by women! In other words, in a year where I make my movie-a-day goal, a third of those must be directed by women. This should be a bit more challenging and a whole lot more fun, I think!\n\nIf you want to see every woman-directed film I’ve watched in 2016 and how I rank them, I made an entire Letterboxd list for the cause. I got my annual viewing of Daisies, and it being my favorite movie ever makes it #1 on the list. Moreover, I went to a charity screening of Paris is Burning, and that rewatch solidifies it at one of the best documentaries of all time. Speed Racer, The Snowman, and You’ve Got Mail were also rewatches, but everything else was totally new to me. They’ve pretty much all got something worth watching for, with some of course being miles better than others. Born in Flames, specifically, is one of the most unabashedly feminist films I had ever seen and simply thinking about it leaves imprints in my mind and soul. Next time I’m feeling truly angry at the world, I’ll be sure to give it a rewatch as a validation of my emotions.\n\nSo to cap off this post, I’ll give a full list of everything I watched in 2016, and after that my top 20 new, non-2016 watches.\n\nMrs. Miniver (Wyler, 1942)\n\nShakespeare in Love (Madden, 1998)\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (Curtiz, 1942)*\n\nMustang (Ergüven, 2015)\n\nThe Danish Girl (Hooper, 2015)\n\nDodsworth (Wyler, 1936)\n\nThe Little Foxes (Wyler, 1941)\n\nBye Bye Birdie (Sidney, 1963)\n\nBreakin’ (Silberg, 1984)*\n\nBreakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo (Firstenberg, 1984)*\n\nJezebel (Wyler, 1938)\n\nThree Kings (Russell, 1999)\n\nWings (Wellman, 1927)\n\nJoy (Russell, 2015)\n\nAnomalisa (Kaufman & Johnson, 2015)\n\nCreed (Coogler, 2015)\n\nDesert Hearts (Deitch, 1985)\n\nMonkey Business (Hawks, 1952)\n\nActress (Greene, 2014)\n\nThe Phantom of the Paradise (De Palma, 1974)\n\nSicario (Villeneuve, 2015)\n\nI Heart Huckabees (Russell, 2004)\n\nRéalité (Reality) (Dupieux, 2014)\n\n21 Jump Street (Lord & Miller, 2012)*\n\n22 Jump Street (Lord & Miller, 2014)\n\nGoosebumps (Letterman, 2015)\n\nSanjay’s Super Team (Patel, 2015)\n\nThe Good Dinosaur (Sohn, 2015)\n\nCrocodile Dundee (Faiman, 1986)\n\nFlirting With Disaster (Russell, 1996)\n\nNuit #1 (Night #1) (Émond, 2011)\n\nThe Revenant (Iñárritu, 2015)\n\nBridge of Spies (Spielberg, 2015)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (Whedon, 2015)\n\nPanique au village (A Town Called Panic) (Aubier & Patar, 2009)*\n\nPhoenix (Petzold, 2015)\n\nEfes beyahasei enosh (Zero Motivation) (Lavie, 2014)\n\nThe Martian (Scott, 2015)\n\nI Was a Male War Bride (Hawks, 1949)\n\nIntolerable Cruelty (Coen, 2003)\n\nThe American Astronaut (McAbee, 2001)*\n\nShe’s Gotta Have It (Lee, 1986)\n\nOnly Angels Have Wings (Hawks, 1939)\n\nElmer’s Candid Camera (Jones, 1940)*\n\nBugs Bunny and the Three Bears (Jones, 1944)*\n\nFast and Furry-ous (Jones, 1949)*\n\nHair-Raising Hare (Jones, 1946)*\n\nAwful Orphan (Jones, 1949)*\n\nHaredevil Hare (Jones, 1948)*\n\nFor Scent-imental Reasons (Jones, 1949)*\n\nFrigid Hare (Jones, 1949)*\n\nThe Hypo-Chondri-Cat (Jones, 1950)\n\nBaton Bunny (Jones & Levitow, 1959)\n\nFeed the Kitty (Jones, 1952)*\n\nDon’t Give Up the Sheep (Jones, 1953)\n\nBugs Bunny Gets the Boid (Clampett, 1942)\n\nTortoise Wins By a Hare (Clampett, 1943)\n\nSamsara (Fricke, 2011)\n\nCartel Land (Heineman, 2015)\n\nFelt (Banker, 2015)\n\nFantasia 2000 (Algar et al., 1999)\n\nCanary Row (Freleng, 1950)\n\nBunker Hill Bunny (Freleng, 1950)\n\nKit For Cat (Freleng, 1948)\n\nPutty Tat Trouble (Freleng, 1951)\n\nBugs and Thugs (Freleng, 1954)\n\nThe Apple (Golan, 1980)\n\nElectric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films (Hartley, 2014)\n\nJûsan-nin no shikaku (13 Assassins) (Miike, 2010)\n\nKung Fu Panda 2 (Yuh, 2011)\n\nAttack the Block (Cornish, 2011)\n\nAve Maria (Khalil, 2015)\n\nShok (Friend) (Donougue, 2015)\n\nAlles wird gut (Everything Will Be Okay) (Vollrath, 2015)\n\nStutterer (Cleary, 2015)\n\nDay One (Hughes, 2015)\n\nSanjay’s Super Team (Patel, 2015)*\n\nWorld of Tomorrow (Hertzfeldt, 2015)\n\nMi ne mozhem zhit bez kosmosa (We Can’t Live Without Cosmos) (Bronzit, 2015)\n\nHistoria de un oso (Bear Story) (Osorio, 2015)\n\nIf I Was God… (Condie, 2015)\n\nThe Short Story of a Fox and a Mouse (Jean et al., 2015)\n\nThe Loneliest Stoplight (Plympton, 2015)\n\nCatch It (Bar, et al., 2015)\n\nPrologue (Williams, 2015)\n\n45 Years (Haigh, 2015)\n\nTeen Witch (Walker, 1989)*\n\nCanned Feud (Freleng, 1951)\n\nLumber Jerks (Freleng, 1955)\n\nSpeedy Gonzales (Freleng, 1955)*\n\nTweety’s S.O.S.

Right before I started my monthly recap of November, I was so overcome with anxiety and depression that I simply lacked the energy for much writing. This recap, however, will be in my regular short review format that I had given to the numerous monthly recaps prior. I know that I need to move on from the sadness that seems to consistently surround everything and one of the best ways I’ve found to do so is by keeping myself busy, particularly with writing. In the final half of this month, I devoted my time and energy to binging on a whole bunch of Christmas TV specials and writing about a bunch of them (these mini-reviews can be found on my Letterboxd). The final product of this is my list of the top 13 Christmas specials from animated TV. Completing this post gave me such an invigorating feeling of satisfaction that I’m excited to carry on throughout the start of 2017 (and hopefully longer).\n\nAnd boy, do I have a lot of things scheduled in the immediate future. To tie in with this post, I also want to do separate posts for (1) a recap of 2016 in movie-watching, (2) a recap of my experience with the #52FilmsByWomen challenge, and (3) a brief overview of the best non-2016 films I watched for the first time this year (although there might be some conflating of two or all three of these topics, depending on how much time/energy I have to accomplish them). After these, I’ll be hard at work on the various “best of” lists I have planned – namely the best albums, hit singles, and films of 2016. And on top of all of this, I want to be more regular with my One Random Single a Day challenge (which I started earlier in December) while also making some actual headway on my overview of the top 100 songs of 1981. Needless to say, I’m going to be one busy person this next month or so!\n\nSo, now for the recap.

Obviously my viewing habits eventually veered off on a different direction, but I still managed to squeeze in twelve films from 2016. Most of these viewings were fortunately very enjoyable, albeit for very different reasons depending on the film. I already wrote a little bit about Stephen Chow’s The Mermaid over on my Letterboxd page, and it’s still one of the funniest films I’ve come across all year. One other fast favorite of this year is Jia Zhangke’s Mountains May Depart, which is an excellent, poetic portrait of life’s cycles spanning several decades. Additionally, Vitali Mansky’s Under the Sun is a terrific documentary that totally took me off-guard with its jarring surrealism surrounding a society that is, nonetheless, all too real. Although it probably won’t make my top films of the year list, Ben Wheatley’s High-Rise was another film that surprised me; I assumed that its weird characters and nearly formless structure would be off-putting, but it turned out that it was precisely what I enjoyed so much about it. Finally, Kenneth Lonergan’s Manchester by the Sea may actually very well be the best film from 2016 I watched all month – but I’ll write more about that one later.\n\nSo, during my 2016 catch-up phase, I sought out Kenzo World, the short film directed by Spike Jonze that was released as an advertisement for the luxury brand Kenzo. It was pretty fun and definitely memorable, but overall felt more like a newer reworking of Jonze’s fantastic music video for Fatboy Slim’s “Weapon of Choice”. Watching this did, however, lead me into a night-long rabbit hole of seeking out as much of Jonze’s short work as I can possibly find available to watch online. Music videos like “Weapon of Choice”, Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage”, and another by Fatboy Slim “Praise You” were obvious standouts; I have watched them all numerous times as a kid when they were on high circulation on TV in the 90s, and each rewatch gave me numerous waves of nostalgia. Additionally, I also watched some of his short narrative films that I had never actually seen before. To Die By Your Side is a macabre little piece that employs some weird stop-motion animation to pull some literary characters right out of their pages. It’s a neat idea, but unfortunately isn’t really explored to any relevant extent in its rather short runtime.\n\nNext, I watched We Once Were a Fairytale, which I had heard good things about around Kanye West’s 808s phase. With West’s recent public breakdown in pretty recent times, this was especially discomforting to watch as his self-doubts and instability are laid out as bare as they could possibly get. West gives a pretty great performance, but Jonze’s signature weird narrative twists and turns – including a truly out-of-the-blue twist ending – elevate this one to true “must watch” status. Since I was already avoiding my usual chronological order of things, I then watched one of his earlier short films How They Get There. It basically just follows two people mimicking each other from across the street until one gets hit by a car. Nothing too impressive, except that this was probably the one short that made me realize the fascination Jonze has for bodies and the strange movements they make (Kenzo World, “Weapon of Choice”, and his feature film Being John Malkovich also support this observation). Finally, I watched his very first directorial effort, the legendary skateboarding tape Video Days. I’m surprised that I had never heard of this, since it’s frequently noted as being one of the most influential skating videos of all time, and I was even surprised with how much I enjoyed it. As another fascinating examination with how human bodies manipulate movement (and, at some points, stumble and fall), it really is quite an engrossing slice of culture that I’d suggest to anyone even mildly interested in the sub-genre.\n\nI won’t talk much in this part, since I want to save most of my breath for my 52 Films recap, but I did watch seven films directed by women in December. The side note being that one of them (The Holiday) was watched earlier in the year already, so that won’t count for another notch on the final number. Secondly, two of these films (How the ‘Dook Stole Christmas and The Snowman) were watched as part of my Christmas binging; the former I absolutely hated and felt as a total corruption of its preceding source material which I loved so much, while the latter is one of my favorite Christmas specials ever, although I already wrote about it in my Christmas post. Besides these, I watched two Kelly Reinhardt films: Meek’s Crossing and Certain Women. From these two – as well as Wendy and Lucy, which is a movie I’ve loved for quite a while already – it is clear that she has formed her true auteurship in quiet, contemplative pictures that, nonetheless, often tackle some really big ideas and themes in condensed, personal narratives. It may take a bit of patience to get through her films, but I’d say that the patience to do so would only be greatly rewarded.\n\nAs mentioned, I already wrote a whole entire post talking about the Christmas specials I watched this season, but I’ll just mention it here again. I initially started off watching every Christmas-related short I stumbled upon and is available to log on Letterboxd. That’s what led me to watching weird stuff like A Christmas Treat, The Shanty Where Santy Claus Lives, and Donkey’s Christmas Shrektacular. Yet sometime after I finished both versions of Trey Parker & Matt Stone’s The Spirit of Christmas – the first one was Jesus vs. Frosty, the second one was Jesus vs. Santa; both are awful – I decided that I wanted a bit more quality and positivity in my viewings, so I sought out more specific themes in my schedule. In total, I watched every Rankin & Bass Christmas special, as well as all the Peanuts cartoons, some Disney cartoons, and some Jim Henson stuff that dealt specifically with the holiday. After I finished with these, I started watching special Christmas episodes of TV shows, soon realizing that animated shows tended to do the holiday the most justice. And thus is the journey of how I got to writing about these animated holiday specials in the first place. It has been really fun having this take up a bulk of my viewing activity this season, and I can’t wait to do it all again next year.\n\nSomewhere in all of this Christmassy mess, I managed to still watch some non-holiday-related movies – including Return of the Jedi, which I finally watched for the first time! People have been throwing tomatoes at me for years because of this blind spot, but having been told that it’s easily the weakest of the original trilogy, I figured there was no rush to watch it right away. So I watched it and… yeah, it’s true. This one definitely doesn’t have quite the narrative tightness of A New Hope or Empire Strike Back and I even found that it drags at bits. Regardless, it’s still a perfectly solid popcorn sci-fi flick. My boyfriend and I watched the original cut, during which he occasionally pointed out during certain scenes the edits that George Lucas made to subsequent rereleases. Some of them sound so preposterous, I may just have to check out the new edit sometime in the future. Of the original trilogy, though, this one has my second favorite final act, after the first film, but maybe that’s because the reveal of Empire has been so oversaturated for me. And of course, I do think the infamous golden bikini is awfully cringeworthy in retrospect, especially in the name of the late, legendary Carrie Fisher. Of course, Leia also gets the incredible scene where she savagely and heartlessly murders Jabba, which almost completely makes up for it all.\n\nOh, and also the Ewoks are adorable! All those haters can get bent!\n\nI was originally supposed to watch The Last American Virgin around the time when I was really obsessed with obscure and weird finds, a few years ago. Somehow it slipped under my radar and I didn’t really think much about it until I spotted it at the library early in the month. I finally watched it and… well, I did enjoy it. It’s so easy to dismiss as just another of those 70s and 80s teen sex comedies, but it comes off as so much more than that. Unlike many of these kinds of hedonistic comedies, there are real life consequences to the characters’ actions and the film doesn’t dare to shy away from some truly awkward, even painful territories. It’s not perfect, of course, and there are several bumps in the story that I will probably skip over in subsequent viewings, but everything else is pretty great. One of the most delightful aspects of the film, to me, is the settings and clothes that just feel so unabashedly 80s in its aesthetic. Overall, it’s a pretty remarkable little film and I’m so happy it has as big of a following as it has garnered to this day.\n\nBeyond the Valley of the Dolls is yet another film that I’ve been putting off for god knows how long. It mainly intrigued me for its cult following, as well as the fact that it was written by Roger Ebert. So, I finally watched it, and while I can’t say I loved it as much as I was expecting to, it’s not one I’m bound to be forgetting about anytime soon. The production design on this one is also beautiful, with its sets, costumes, and general look and feel practically popping with vibrant colors and lighting that feel almost like a parody of the 70s. And in a way, I guess it is, if only for how ridiculous the plot gets as it inches closer and closer to its climax. The writing is practically from a whole other planet, with lines of dialogue that are so tawdry, weirdly prose-like in nature, it’s impossible to believe that any actually human being could have uttered such words (my personal favorite: “‘Step into my web’, said the spider, et cetera.”). Once again, some of the turns it takes in the story aren’t really to my liking and I found the novelty of its peculiarity to dwindle as the final act came to a close. Still, it’s one that I’ll always be excite to slip back on for a groovy, psychedelic time.\n\nAnd that concludes this post! Stay tuned and ready for my recap of 2016 in films, which should be coming around here in the next day or so. Hope you have a safe and happy new year!\n\nI became dangerously close to missing the appropriate window to post this, primarily due to being on holiday vacation and simply not having the time to sit down at my computer for an hour or two. But nonetheless, here it is. I’m usually pretty conservative with the amount of holiday specials I watch in a given season, but I decided to try something a little different this time. Throughout the month of December, I binged through pretty much every made-for-TV Christmas special I could find, including special TV episodes and some variety shows. It was basically my quest from the very start to find the best of the bunch, including all the weird stuff and little seen gems. That includes everything from the classic Rankin/Bass specials to… well, whatever the hell Alpha’s Magical Christmas was.\n\nThere are still some that I have not yet seen (and rightfully so, as is the case with Star Wars Holiday Special), but I basically skimmed and scoured through every one of these lists I could find and watched the ones that I’m sure would be the most interest of me. I averaged about 10-15 viewings of these specials per day during the second half of December, making my total number of special watched somewhere in the 100s. My discoveries made me realize that the animated Christmas specials are the ones that stand out to me the most. It’s most likely because I’m already pretty biased toward animated stories over live-action ones, but they also just tend to feel more Christmassy than the live-action ones. I think there’s this level of freedom we give to animation in terms of how much sentimentality they’re allowed to project, because animation is still considered kids fare by many. Live-action films that basically recreate the ending to It’s a Wonderful Life often end up feeling too schmaltzy for their own good, while animated films are given a bit more freedom. Also, much of what I watched featured characters that I were already familiar with, so seeing them take time out of their daily adventures to celebrate the holiday is usually a delightful novelty.\n\nAnyway, as you could probably surmise, the purpose of this point is for me to rank the best of the best here. This is strictly for TV specials, primarily those only about 20-60 minutes in length, and does not include feature films or theatrical shorts. To be fair, though, only about the top three or so are firmly ranked, while the others are free to be interchanged given whatever mood I’m in.\n\nA FEW HONORABLE MENTIONS…\n\nRecently, I had come to the pretty tragic realization that puppetry most likely does not count as animation. Thus, I had to remove my inclusion of both The Christmas Toy and A Muppet Family Christmas from this list. Both are absolutely charming and I would highly recommend them to any Christmas playlist out there; they just don’t exactly fit for the purposes of this list. However, if I were wiling to stretch the rules to include the work of Jim Henson, A Muppet Family Christmas would undoubtedly be #1. It’s pretty impossible to watch that one and walk away in even a remotely bad mood.\n\nWhen I started this project, I wanted to make it all about the winter holiday season as a whole. Unfortunately, it’s pretty hard to find much diversity regarding the range of holiday specials that aren’t strictly about Christmas. Hanukkah cartoon specials are pretty much nonexistent, save for The Rugrats: “A Chanukah Special”, which handled the teaching of the tradition with an amazing amount of sensitivity fit for both kids and adults. Likewise, even though Kwanzaa is briefly mentioned in shows like The Boondocks and Arthur, the only cartoon special that devotes a good chunk of its time to the holiday is The Proud Family: “7 Days of Kwanzaa”. I would also highly recommend this special, mainly due to its smooth integration of the holiday into the show’s formula, but also because the episode is often pretty hilarious.\n\nWith the original rules in place, I really wanted to add Rudolph’s Shiny New Year. Even after I decided to make this strictly a Christmas list, I wanted to make an exception for it so badly, but in the end I decided against it. Truth be told, though, this is one of the strongest of the Rankin & Bass holiday specials, including some of the more interesting characters and themes of their entire repertoire.\n\nNow, on with the list!\n\n13) Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nIn a way, I kind of see this as just a placeholder for Rudolph’s Shiny New Year… but I think it rightfully deserves a spot on this list as well! This was the very first of the string of infamous Rankin & Bass holiday specials of the 60s and 70s, and you could do a whole lot worse of an introduction. It delicately takes from its classic source material to carve out characters of yore – as well as some new faces – into full-fledged personalities and images. I had watched this countless times as a kid, but this most recent rewatch came over ten years later. Some aspects of it don’t quite hold up (the animation is some of the duo’s most stilted, the story isn’t the most polished, Burl Ives is less than charming), but there’s no denying that its prevalence in the holiday season is admirable and fully deserved.\n\n12) The Town That Santa Forgot\n\nThe Town That Santa Forgot was a Christmas special that, truthfully, I myself have forgotten about up until looking up viewing possibilities. I watched it a couple times on Cartoon Network in the 90s and it never even crossed my mind again until this last viewing. The story is as simple as can get, detailing the attempts of a greedy boy who writes a mile-long list to Santa demanding an abundance of toys all to himself. Santa and his elves misinterpret these demands as coming from an entire village of impoverished children and… well, you can probably guess where it goes from there. The moral is paper-thin, yet Dick Van Dyke’s whimsical rhyming narration is somehow very effective and surprisingly tugs at the ol’ heartstrings from time to time. Not to mention that I carry a certain amount of nostalgia for the animation style of this, with its simple lines and colors so reminiscent of this particular era of Cartoon Network.\n\n11) Santa Claus is Coming to Town\n\nI don’t know if I’ll ever be completely, 100% satisfied with the ways that Rankin/Bass specials and the ilk tend to take their own liberties with familiar source material, but I think the directions that the story takes in Santa Claus is Coming to Town are some of the most satisfying. The narrative of Santa’s rise to infamy is a story that practically writes itself, but this film has not only an enjoyable story but colorful characters and some pretty cool songs as well. Fred Astaire is a terrific narrator, and although I’m not a fan of Mickey Rooney as a whole, his voice work as the titular Claus is pretty fun. It’s taken me way too long to get around to this one, and it’s probably one of the most satisfying surprises I’ve stumbled upon this season.\n\n10) Mickey’s Christmas Carol\n\nNow, I know that this is technically a theatrical featurette and for that reason alone it could be disqualified. However, I know this feature from front to back and my experience with it has solely been from watching it air on cable TV during Christmastime in my childhood, so I’ll allow it. One thing I noticed with many Christmas-themed TV episodes is that many of them really love to remake A Christmas Carol, yet very few of them are successful at adding their own spin to it that we haven’t seen done dozens of times over. This is precisely what Mickey’s Christmas Carol excels at. To me, Goofy is the definitive Jacob Marley; Mickey and family are the definitive Cratchits; Pete is the definitive Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come; and of course Scrooge McDuck is the most perfect cartoonification of Ebenezer himself. I’m aware of all those other live-action renditions of the tale that are excellent in their own ways, but Christmas and cartoons fit together for me like peanut butter and jelly. Therefore, one will be hard-pressed to find another version of A Christmas Carol that means more to me than this one. Disney just does Christmas so wholesomely, it’s hard not to love it.\n\n9) Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey\n\nThis might be the single darkest Rankin/Bass Christmas special, and quite possibly the most overlooked. I know that I always seemed to pass this one over up until this past month. Beginning with Rudolph, the duo seem to have a real affinity for social outcasts, individuals who are singled out for what is deemed an irredeemable defect, physical or otherwise. Nestor is one of the studio’s cutest creations and his story is so sad, it’s hard to come to terms with what might exactly be the point of it all. Of course, it all ties up in the final third in yet another retelling of the very first Christmas, though I think the religious nature of its conclusion helps rather than hampers the overall effect. While looking back on the whole Rankin/Bass filmography, this is one of the ones on which I tend to think of the most fondly. I’m pretty excited to make this a future staple of my holiday viewings.\n\n8) Frosty the Snowman\n\nIf I wanted to, I could nitpick the hell out of this. I could pull out every plot hole or awkward interactions between characters or clumsy animation of which Frosty the Snowman is so full. But to do so would miss the point – it is because of its shameless simplicity and kid-like nature of storytelling that makes this particular venture so charming. I’ve written elsewhere about the nostalgia for this film I hold so near and dear, and that may be the primary reason that keeps me from ranking this particular special any lower. I wouldn’t dare! As far as I’m concerned, the song came after the film, virtuously inspired by the wintry enchantment so perfectly encapsulated in every frame of this cartoon. If there was any Christmas special that perfectly captured what the holiday meant to me as a little kid, this is the one – more so than The Snowman even. But more on that later.\n\n7) Pinky and the Brain: “A Pinky and the Brain Christmas”\n\nA little bit of background – although I love The Animaniacs to bits, I never really got into the Pinky and the Brain spinoff series. I’m not even sure why! All of the best writers and voice actors are involved and the humor is proven to be just as sharp and clever as that which is found in its parent series. And thus is the case with the series’ beloved Christmas episode, much of which is devoted entirely to making an absolute mockery of the sterile commercialism of the holiday. The humor, as always, is consistently sharp and clever, but it’s the heartwarming ending that really kicks this one up a couple notches for me. I’m not even ashamed to admit that I even shed a tear or two during this finale – but then again, I always end up falling prey to these moments of overt sentimentality anyway. Still, this isn’t one that should be missed.\n\n6) Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmas\n\nNow, here’s one that really surprised me! As much as I’ve emphasized how much Mickey’s Christmas Carol means to me on a personal level, at its hardest, shelliest core, it really is just another Christmas Carol retelling. Its source material has become stale over time and despite the terrific imagery that comes with it, it can’t really save itself from its stiff narrative structure. Once Upon a Christmas, on the other hand, offers three adorable Christmas tales featuring some most beloved Disney characters, each of which offering its own special twist to the holiday. From Huey, Dewey, & Louie enduring a Groundhog Day-like phenomenon to teach them a moral lesson; to Max having doubts about Santa’s existence, while Goofy attempts to quell these threats to childlike innocence; to Mickey and Minnie recreating “The Gift of Magi”, with a finale that is predictable though irresistibly charming. The look and feel of this special is undeniably Christmas-like and there’s so much to enjoy in each of the three stories. For Christmas lovers like myself, this special is an absolute delight.\n\n5) The Simpsons: “Marge Be Not Proud”\n\nIs there any sadder tale around Christmastime than that of the kid whose dignified innocence is yanked away inexplicably? Christmas is the perfect time to be young, yet Bart is treated as an adult as a form of punishment for the naughty crime of shoplifting. Somehow, through the show’s consistently impeccable writing and frame of reference, this seems like the most tragic fate to ever befall a child. Golden era Simpsons is always worth making a fuss about, and while I much prefer their “Treehouse of Horror” episodes over anything else, this is a stellar example of how the show takes their own liberties with traditional yuletide themes in their own groundbreaking style. As with practically every episode of this era, it’s sharply humorous from start to finish, while also balancing a hefty amount of emotional appeal when the time calls for such. Most importantly, though, this is one of my favorite episodes that strengthens the relationship between Marge and Bart, a fitting interpretation of the ways that a son can betray his mother – and vice versa.\n\n4) Hey Arnold!: “Arnold’s Christmas”\n\nAlthough I watched many Christmas episodes of animated shows this past month, there were very few that I found fit to make this list. I wish I could conjure up a more satisfying reason why, but I think it comes down to finding a balance between originality and tradition storytelling in its narrative. Many holiday episodes often try to put their own spin on the holiday norms, which is all fine and dandy until it simply no longer feels Christmassy. At the same time, however, there’s a reason why the hundredth retelling of A Christmas Carol feels so tiresome. This is where I think Hey Arnold!‘s Christmas special succeeds, namely in placing the traditional holiday traditions of togetherness and the spirit of giving in the context of loss and grief. The series has never been afraid to take on difficult issues dealt with by kids in an urban environment, but the adults in Arnold’s boarding house often have much deeper, more intriguing stories than that which with they are initially introduced. Mr. Hyunh’s pain is concrete and realistic, making Arnold and Gerald’s tireless efforts to help him out all the more endearing. Though one of my absolute favorite things about this episode is the way they develop Helga’s arc. Helga is far and away my favorite character on the show, and her growth in discovering the magic of helping others out of the goodness of her heart is such a beautiful phenomenon to watch unfold. And yes, I did cry at the end of this one as well. Even though this one has never been a regular staple in my seasonal watching schedule, it has undoubtedly left a mark in some of the most beautiful ways.\n\n3) The Snowman\n\nI must admit that The Snowman has never been a staple of my childhood, like I’m sure it has for many others. Since I’m from the US, I never really caught it showing on my TV at all; I never even watched it until well after I had turned 18. Moreover, having lived my whole life in California, I have never seen the snow and am possibly as detached from the context of The Snowman as one could get. Nonetheless, I love it. I love its picture book method of storytelling; I love its wordless, speechless narrative; I love the fantastical adventures on which we’re taken by the titular snowman; I love “Walking in the Air”. While watching this, though, something just hurts. Even before the suddenly tragic ending, the painful nostalgia of childhood lost just pervades through the entirety of this formless tale. It’s just all so beautiful in a grown-up, adult kind of way, yet has somehow become remembered as particularly palatable for children, as fleeting as their time inevitably is. It’s a magical sort of film that only comes around once in a great while.\n\n2) A Charlie Brown Christmas\n\nIf you would have asked me a year ago what my favorite Christmas specials would be, there was no way that A Charlie Brown Christmas would be ranked so highly. Maybe it’s because it’s my mom’s favorite Christmas special, but I always found it to be both awkward and cloying in its delivery of its message. More than anything, however, I think my formerly strict renouncing of anything related to Christianity automatically made me turn my nose at the scene wherein Linus gives his heartfelt oration of the annunciation to the shepherds from the Gospel of Luke. Nowadays, I don’t mind that scene much at all and I love practically everything else about this film. Upon this last rewatch, I realized that this is probably the closest that any film has gotten to depicting the modes of depression I usually endure around the holiday season. Much like Charlie Brown, I find it increasingly more and more difficult to relate to others around me, particularly in the bliss and joyfulness others seem to find in the holiday season. We both seek refuge in things that feel the coziest – Charlie Brown has his flimsy pine tree; I’ve got my cartoon TV specials – and we both feel frustrated when others can’t understand our feelings. Now, I still love all the little scenes in between, such as the images of the children ice skating and dancing to the tune of Vince Guaraldi’s tranquil score. But now that adulthood has left me jaded by the simplicity of its humor and animation, I’m left with the bigger picture that has, undoubtedly, left an even more profound mark on my Christmas vision. I don’t know how I ever doubted the genius of this one.\n\n1) Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\n\nWith how much I love The Nightmare Before Christmas as a Halloween staple and other similarly dark subversions of otherwise happy, joyful holiday fare, there was no way that How the Grinch Stole Christmas wouldn’t be my #1 animated Christmas special. At its core, it really is just a blending of a multitude at talents displaying the very best of their talents. Dr. Seuss! Chuck Jones! Boris Karloff, June Foray (kind of), and Thurl Ravenscroft! From the Christmassy colors and images, to Seuss’ beautifully whimsical prose, to the sly and slimy personification of the Grinch himself (complete with Karloff’s untouchable voice work) – this is one of the few specials that I have always loved with not a doubt in my mind, and I’m pretty sure I always will. Although now that I know so much more about Chuck Jones than I had back in the day, it’s hard not to see his fingerprints all over this one, yet there’s more than enough breathing room given to the truly Seussical environments of Whoville that nothing else since has even come close to touching. This Christmas special forever gives me the hope that any sad, solemn soul can be so touched by the wholesomeness of the season that their heart grows three sizes too big. It’s basically everything I love about the season wrapped up in a neat little package, set to the tune of the effortlessly slinky “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch”, a karaoke bucket list item for myself. I love this film with every inch of my cold, wintry heart, and at this point it shouldn’t be too hard to see why. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, folks!"
