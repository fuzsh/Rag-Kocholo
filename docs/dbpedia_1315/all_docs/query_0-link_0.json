The show premiered on October 5, 1963 and is one of the earliest Saturday morning cartoons. The show included a mix of 26 new Casper cartoons created for this show by Paramount Cartoon Studios, as well as a selection of 1959â€”62 cartoons from the aforementioned Paramount, which were mostly the later Modern Madcaps and Noveltoons which were repackaged as \"Modern Madcaps\". All voices in the Casper episodes were performed by Norma MacMillan and Bradley Bolke. All of the new material was created for the first season in 1963-1964, but the show continued airing in reruns on ABC for six seasons, ending on January 30, 1970.
