        "text": "The Huckleberry Hound Show\n\n1958\n\nThe Huckleberry Hound Show is an animated TV series about a blue dog with a Southern drawl and a fondness for the song \"My Darling, Clementine.\" Three segments were included in each episode: one featuring Huckleberry Hound, another starring Yogi Bear and his sidekick Boo Boo, and a third with Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks, which starred two mice who in each short found a new way to outwit the cat Mr. Jinks. Every episode had him playing the part of a different profession, from police officer to lion tamer to medieval knight. The one thing that remained constant was Huckleberry's unruffled persistence to triumph over his opponent no matter how often he was outsmarted, outfought or fell victim to his own failed plans.\n\nThe Yogi Bear Show\n\n1958\n\nThe Yogi Bear Show is a spinoff of \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\", in which Yogi first appeared. Yogi lived in Jellystone Park where his predilection for picnic baskets were slowly developed. His pal Boo Boo wistfully tagged along, and they both had to deal with Ranger Smith. Along with Yogi were Yakky Doodle, a naive little duck whose bulldog pal Chopper protects him from Fibber Fox; and Snagglepuss, about a stage-struck mountain lion; he first appeared in 1959 in episodes of Quick Draw McGraw.\n\nAugie Doggie and Doggie Daddy\n\n1959\n\nAugie Doggie and Doggie Daddy was originally on the \"Quickdraw McGraw\" show. Augie, the son of Doggie Daddy, was the intelligent one of the pair. He would always look up to his 'Dear Old Dad' for guidance in all sorts of different predicaments. The series follows the pair as they go on all sorts of adventures, like camping and winding up in outer space, or doing yard work and winding up tending to the health of a mob of crows.\n\nSnagglepuss\n\n1961\n\nDespite being a mountain lion, Snagglepuss is a rather sophisticated individual who merely seeks to better himself and his living situation. He lives in a damp and dark cavern, which isn’t too comfortable for someone of his standing. Unfortunately for him, life isn’t always fair for a mountain lion and he has to constantly ward off hunters, and some people refuse to talk to him because they’re afraid that he’ll eat them, not that he would do such a thing. Through it all, Snagglepuss’ life is one bizarre twist after another, and even though he’s a swell guy, the civilized world seldom wants anything to do with him.\n\nYakky Doodle\n\n1961\n\nYakky Doodle (voiced by Jimmy Weldon to sound similar to Donald Duck) is an anthropomorphic duck who lives with his best friend Chopper the bulldog. Yakky is always one to run into danger when it's most expected. This usually comes in the form of the show's main antagonist Fibber Fox or secondary villain Alfy Gator. Chopper defends his \"Little Buddy\" fiercely, and is always ready to pound Fibber or any other enemy into oblivion if necessary. Yakky's tendency to put himself in great danger never draws a rebuke from Chopper, who presumably enjoys his protective role.\n\nTop Cat\n\n1961\n\nTop Cat, known as T.C. to his alley cat friends, is a mischievous prankster who lives in a trash can in the alley ways of New York City. He and his alley-cat cohorts think of get rich schemes and assorted pranks which are mostly involving and aimed at Officer Dibble, their nemesis and friend. T.C. manages to get out of his tight situations with hilarity and charm and even helps Dibble on occasion who is underscored by his overbearing sergeant.\n\nWally Gator\n\n1962\n\nWally Gator is an anthropomorphic, happy-go-lucky alligator who wears a collar and a pork pie hat. Although his catchy theme song describes him as a \"swingin' alligator of the swamp\", his home is in the city zoo. Mr. Twiddle is the zookeeper who keeps a close watch on Wally because sometimes he escapes to check out what things are like in the outside world.\n\nTouché Turtle and Dum Dum\n\n1962\n\nEach episode starts off with Touché popping forth from inside his shell. He then gets a phone call from someone who's in dire straits. His phone usually rests upon a sterling silver plate. Touché accepts all major credit cards. Thus, Touché and Dum-Dum go off into the crime scene and do their shtick, which may involve swordplay, box-fighting, martial arts, tom-foolery, work with pyrotechnics/explosives... and so on. \"Touché-Away!!\" The original show of 52 episodes first aired on TV between September 1962 and August 1963. Touché and Dum Dum have appeared together in only a handful of 1960s-early 1970s H-B comic books, and both also showed up on Hanna-Barbera's 50th anniversary special in 1988 (you may find that on video).\n\nRicochet Rabbit & Droop-a-Long\n\n1964\n\nRicochet Rabbit worked as a sheriff in a Western setting called Hoop 'n' Holler. Ricochet, true to his name, would bounce off all the walls yelling \"bing-bing-bing!\" His deputy Droop-A-Long Coyote was never able to be as \"jumpy\" and would end up crashing through a window, or some similar accident except on one occasion when Ricochet and Droop-A-Long were running away from a bear. Unfortunately for both of them, the bear also managed to bounce off. In addition to his speed, Ricochet was known for using trick bullets against his opponents (for example, a bullet that would stop in mid-flight and hover while striking the bad guy with an impossibly over-sized mallet, or exploding after inside bigger compartments of the bullet). Ricochet Rabbit's catchphrase consisted of three quick bings; \"bing, bing, BING!\", followed by him referring to himself in the third person; \"Ricochet Rabbit!\"\n\nPunkin' Puss & Mushmouse\n\n1964\n\nThe show features a cat called Punkin' Puss who lives in a house in the woods of the southern US. Punkin' is preoccupied with a mouse called Mushmouse who lives there too, and Punkin' frequently tries to shoot him with his rifle. The cat looks similar to the cats in Top Cat's gang. One episode, \"Nowhere Bear\", has the cat continually disrupting an angry bear's sleep. Another, \"Small Change\", has Punkin Puss (and later a dog as well) shrinking to mouse size. Usually one of Mushmouse's cousins comes and gives Punkin' a hard time. Many would think Punkin' would stop bullying Mushmouse when this occurs but to no avail on Mushmouse's behalf when the relative leaves.\n\nPeter Potamus and So-So\n\n1964\n\nThe sixth Hanna-Barbera syndicated cartoon after their departure from MGM starred Peter Potamus (a purple hippopotamus), and his traveling companion So-So (a monkey), who fly back and forth through time in a balloon participating in historic events. Whenever they get into serious enough trouble, as they do in every episode, Peter defeats his enemies with his trademark \"Hippo Hurricane Hollar.\" Other cartoon shorts include, \"Breezly and Sneely,\" and \"Yippee, Yappee, and Yahooey.\"\n\nAtom Ant\n\n1965\n\nAtom Ant operated out of an anthill in the countryside, where he possessed such things as a mainframe computer and exercise equipment. His powers mostly consisted of the ability to fly, superspeed, and amazing strength. He was often contacted by the police, who sent him out on assignment. Some of these missions parodied those of Batman. In one episode, the police force was shown to be underfunded and inept, as they relied on Atom Ant to do all their police work. The only two police officers were the chief and deputy chief. The department only possessed one rusted patrol car. Atom Ant fights various villians including recurring ones like Ferocious Flea and mad scientist Professor Von Gimmick.\n\nDino Boy in the Lost Valley\n\n1966\n\nIt stars Todd, a young boy, and his caveman friend Ugh. They adventure together through a lush South American valley filled with prehistoric friends and foes after Todd straps on a parachute and jumps out of the crashing plane that was carrying his whole family. Along the way, he learns the value of independence as well as the value and necessity of working with others as a team. Todd even finds a pet, and takes on the responsibilities of caring for Bronto with great enthusiasm. Dangers abound as the trio continues their adventure, but allies in the valley are as plentiful as enemies, and there is a Bronto or Ugh for every saber-toothed tiger encountered. Colorful, well-voiced and cleverly animated, Dino Boy is a great bet for anyone looking for a fun, educational experience to share with a child.\n\nThe Herculoids\n\n1967\n\nThe Herculoids are a group of five super-powered creatures lead by King Zandor of Amzot, his wife Tara, and his son, Dorno. They live together on the planet Quasar and fight against the inevitable alien invaders who seem to show up every week. They crossed over with many other Hanna/Barbera characters such as Space Ghost, the genie Shazam, and many more that remain popular to this day. The shows varied between 10 and 15 minutes, and were often mixed with other shows. Characters (The Herculoids) Gloop & Gleep: Two yellow blobs that can change their forms at will, stretch, and are incredibly elastic. Tundro: A rhinoceros-like dinosaur with thick shielding, he can stretch out his ten legs and blast rocks from its one horn that burst open, causing a mess. Zok: A flying dragon that can release laser beams from its tail and eyes, and can survive in outer space. Igoo: A large ape made of rock, compiled of immense power and very hard to bring down. Zandor, Tara\n\nFantastic Four (1967)\n\n1967\n\nThe Fantastic Four is an animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and the first animated series based on Marvel's comic book series Fantastic Four.[1] The program, featuring character designs by Alex Toth, aired on ABC from 1967 to 1970. It lasted for 20 episodes, with repeat episodes airing on ABC until the network cancelled the program. It was also rerun as part of the continuing series Hanna-Barbera's World of Super Adventure. Through a series of transactions, Disney currently holds the rights to the majority of Marvel's 1960s-1990s animated output. However, the 1967-1968 Fantastic Four was produced by Hanna-Barbera, whose library is now owned by Time Warner, making the series one of only a handful of Marvel-related TV projects not owned by Disney (which has since acquired Marvel outright). Time Warner is also the owner of Marvel's biggest competitor, DC Comics.\n\nMighty Mightor\n\n1967\n\nOne day, while on a hunting trip, a teenage caveman named Tor, along with his winged pet dinosaur Tog, rescue an old man who, as a reward, gives Tor a magical club. When Tor raises his club to the sky, he transforms into the masked and muscular Mightor, a prehistoric superhero who possesses superhuman strength and the power of flight through his club, which can also fire energy blasts. He can also transform Tog into a powerful fire-breathing dragon. Mightor protects his village from evil-doers. Amongst the villagers are the chief, Pondo, and his daughter, the beautiful redhaired Sheera. Sheera has a younger brother named Little Rok, who loves pretending to be Mightor. The characters have several pets, including Little Rok's dodo bird, Ork, and Sheera's mammoth calf, Bollo.\n\nYoung Samson & Goliath\n\n1967\n\nYoung Samson is an animated show from the 1960s was about a boy and his dog who could transform into super-powered versions of themselves to fight evil. Whenever the boy touched his gold bracelets together and said, \"I need Samson power!\" he became the biblical strongman Samson, and his dog became the super lion, Goliath. Instead of dealing with Delilah and the Philistines, they battled modern villains and monsters.\n\nThe Three Musketeers (1968)\n\n1968\n\nThe Three Musketeers- Porthos, Aramis and Athos- are joined by their new recruit, D'Artagnan. The Three Musketeers train their protege as one of the most evil schemes against the King unfolds. Cardinal Richelieu wants to divide the royalty up so that he can get a piece of it. Richelieu tries to prove that Queen Anne is conspiring with the English throne against her husband, King Louis XIII. Richelieu's plan becomes more powerful after Anne gives the Duke of Buckingham, for his kind service to her, a heralded set of 12 studded diamonds. Will Richelieu be able to prove to King Louis XIII that Anne is out to take away his throne? If he does, France will definitely be headed for a war. It is up to the Three Musketeers to save the day.\n\nDanger Island\n\n1968\n\nProduced by Hanna-Barbera, this live-action adventure serial was broadcast in 1968–69 as part of \"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour.\" The series comprises a three-hour adventure split into 36 short chapters, each of which is 10 minutes long and includes a suspenseful cliffhanger that is resolved in the next installment. The series was a training ground for two future stars: director Richard Donner (who went on to direct \"Superman,\" \"The Goonies\" and \"Lethal Weapon\") and actor Jan-Michael Vincent (who starred in the hit TV show \"Airwolf\" in the 1980s).\n\nAround the World in 79 Days\n\n1969\n\nLoosely based upon the novel Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne, this was an adventure series involving balloonist Phileas Fogg, Jr. (the son of the main character Phileas Fogg in the novel) and teenagers Jenny and Happy, who set out on a globetrotting adventure to sail around the world in 79 days and beat Phileas Sr.'s record. The trio are in competition for both the record and a US$1,000,000 prize against the sinister Crumden.\n\nMotormouse and Autocat\n\n1969\n\nIn this Hanna-Barbera show, Motor Mouse lives in the Spin Your Wheels garage, where it's the job of Auto Cat to get rid of him, only to fail time after time. (But all's not war and thorns--often, at the end of the day, Motor Mouse will give Auto Cat a lift home.) Motormouse & Autocat first appeared with sixteen episodes as part of the back segments to the Cattanooga Cats show. The following year on September 12, 1970, the hour-long show was split into two half-hours.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You!\n\n1969\n\nThe first incarnation of what has become a franchise-of-sorts, Scooby-Doo is a large, loveable but cowardly Great Dane who hangs around four California high school students (Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy). The four teen-agers are in constant search of mysteries and adventures, driving around in a bright green van known as the Mystery Machine. Many of the group's adventures involve villians who take on supernatural disguises (ghosts and monsters); the villians' activities usually involve blackmail, theft, fraud and other forms of corruption.\n\nJosie and the Pussycats\n\n1970\n\nJosie and the Pussycats followed the adventures of an all-girl rock and roll group as they travelled the world playing gigs and solving mysteries. Josie began her career as an Archie comics character in the late 1960's, starring in her own self-titled book. The stories followed the day-to-day adventures of Josie and her girlfriend Melody. Later, the title was expanded to Josie and the Pussycats, turning Josie and Melody into a rock band, along with new friend Valerie. Singer/guitarist Josie was the level-headed leader, drummer Melody added zaniness with her half-witted remarks and effervescent charm, and tambourinist Valerie was the brains of the group, typically saving the day with her intellect and know-how. Along with the three Pussycats were roadie (and Josie's boyfriend) Alan, band manager Alexander Cabot III, his conniving sister Alexandra, and her mischiveous little cat, Sebastian. Bitter and talentless Alexandra had her eye on Alan, and constantly schemed to remove Josie\n\nThe Funky Phantom\n\n1971\n\nMudsy was a ghost that haunted the Muddlemore mansion. He slept in the grandfather clock and had never been woken up. One day three teens turned the hands on the clock to 12 and when the clock started to bong. Mudsy woke up, along with his cat Boo. The teens solve crimes and defeat bad guys. This show was one of the early examples of Hanna Barbara sourcing overseas animation services (Australia) which later became a standard practice.\n\nWait Till Your Father Gets Home\n\n1972\n\nWait Till Your Father Gets Home chronicles the lives of the Boyles, your average 1970's American family. Harry Boyle, the father, owns a restaurant supply company. His wife Irma portrays the typical housewife, with an occasional independent flare. Harry and Irma have three children: Chet, Alice, and Jamie. Chet, who is 22, is a college dropout, who spends most of his time sleeping. Alice is a rather robust 16-year-old, who teams up with her mother, to display the independence of women, in the 70's. Jamie is the Capitalist of the family, even though he is only 9. The show is set in the suburbs of Los Angeles, on Elm Street, to be precise. During the 1973 season, the show was host to many celebrity voices, including: Don Knotts, Phyllis Diller, Bea Arthur and many more (many of these guests were carried over from The New Scooby-Doo Movies, which were recored at this time).\n\nThe Flintstone Comedy Hour\n\n1972\n\nThe Flintstone Comedy Hour is a 60-minute Saturday morning animated anthology series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. The program originally aired on CBS as an hour-long show from September 9, 1972 to September 1, 1973 on CBS. The show's first half-hour featured two shorts with Fred & Barney, gags and horoscopes, one short with the cast of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm and two songs performed by the new Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm band called \"The Bedrock Rockers\" followed by four new episodes and reruns of The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show in the second half-hour.\n\nThe New Scooby-Doo Movies\n\n1972\n\nFollowing a successful run of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, The New Scooby-Doo Movies was the first of many reincarnations of the lovable talking hound's show. To boost the already increasing popularity of the series, each episode of The New Scooby Doo Movies featured a guest star -- ranging from celebrities like Sonny and Cher and Monkees frontman Davy Jones to characters from other Hanna/Barbara cartoons like Josie and the Pussycats and Speed Buggy. The format basically stayed the same -- the most notable change being that each episode doubled in size from a thirty minute episode to sixty minutes. Scooby and the gang still found themselves foiling the bad guys in rubber masks like in the original series, but this time around the guest stars would help out and be another source of comedic hijinks. This series ran for two seasons with a total of 24 episodes and has had a long life in syndication. There is a lot of confusion surrounding the official titles of the episodes, whic\n\nButch Cassidy & The Sundance Kids\n\n1973\n\nThe show was about a group of young people who were members of a band, the Sundance Kids. They had a lot of fans, had records, signed autographs, etc. But the band was just a cover. Actually, the Sundance Kids were undercover members of the CIA. They posed as a band to lift suspicion off of them while they solved the cases assigned to them. They got their assignments from their 'manager' a branch of the CIA posing as The World Wide Talent Agency. The head of it was the manager, a huge computer called Mr. Socrates, who looked and sounded like HAL from '2001, A Space Oddessy', and who would contact the Sundance Kids va Butch's radio ring whenever he had an assignment for them. He would line up a gig for them so no one would wonder why musicians were there while they solved the case. There was at least one song in every episode. The characters: BUTCH CASSIDY (seriously!): The Designated leader of the Kids. He plays Lead Guitar and is the Lead Singer of the group. Unlike Fr\n\nSuper Friends\n\n1973\n\nSuper Friends first aired on ABC on September 8, 1973, featuring well-known DC characters Superman, Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman as part of its Saturday morning cartoon lineup. It was produced by Hanna-Barbera and was based on the Justice League of America (JLA) and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics. The name of the program (and the JLA members featured with the Super Friends) have been variously represented (as Super Friends and Challenge of the Super Friends, for example) at different points in its broadcast history.\n\nInch High, Private Eye\n\n1973\n\nInch High, Private Eye was a 1973 Saturday morning cartoon produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. The titular character of Inch High, Private Eye was a miniature detective (literally one inch high). Inch often enlisted the help of his niece Lori (sometimes written \"Laurie\"), her muscle-bound friend Gator, and their dog Braveheart to help solve mysteries. Their primary mode of transportation was the Hushmobile, a streamlined car that made virtually no noise while being driven, making it perfect for following criminals unnoticed. The small Inch worked for The Finkerton Detective Agency (a wordplay lampoon of The Pinkerton Detective Agency), where the boss (Mr. Finkerton) constantly dreamed of the day that he would fire him.\n\nThe Addams Family (1973)\n\n1973\n\nThis animated series follows the adventures of the Addams family as they travel through the country in a special haunted wagon and encounter new friends Abigail the bat, Ocho the octopus and Ali Gator. Hanna Barbera first used the Addams Family as guest stars on their popular Scooby Doo show. Their appearances were so well received that the firm spun them off into their own show. In this, the Family is travelling about America in a special haunted wagon that can even dig a moat when they settle down for the evening.\n\nPartridge Family 2200 AD\n\n1974\n\nWelcome to The Partridge Family, 2200 A.D. guide at TV Tome. After four years on ABC Primetime & live action, they switch to CBS Saturday Morning, propel themselves into the future and become animated. Originally, this was slated to be a part of a proposed new version of The Jetsons (ABC, 1962-63), with Judy as an ace reporter and Elroy a high school student. Friends of the family included Veenie (Keith's martain friend) & Marion (Laurie's friend). Danny had a pet robot dog named Orbit. On the syndicated Fred Flintstone & Friends, it was retitled The Partridge Family In Outer Space.\n\nValley of the Dinosaurs\n\n1974\n\nDuring a rafting excursion of an uncharted river canyon, Professor John Butler, wife Kim, kids Katie and Greg and family dog Digger get caught up in a mysterious whirlpool and resurface in a world of prehistoric creatures.

Unlike the other vehicles in the show, Wheelie only speaks in body sound effects, but also emotes by his honking language and displaying symbols across his windshield monitor showing his inner thoughts. He can also produce any form of prop needed from his hood latch through the use of special mechanized hands. Wheelie's regular nemeses are a four-member motorcycle agency called the Chopper Bunch.\n\nThe Tom & Jerry Show (1975)\n\n1975\n\nAfter years of fighting, and continuously trying to do each other in, Tom and Jerry have called truce, and are now best friends. This cartoon is a more gentle, and non-violent show. Jerry had a new look, with his red bow tie on. They go on new adventures together through the world of sports, villains, and more. Like in the original show, Tom and Jerry don't speak. The show was cut up in three short 10-minute episodes. It wasn't as popular as its predecessor, but it is still remembered by its creators, and, of course, its fans.\n\nThe Great Grape Ape Show\n\n1975\n\nGrape Ape stands a whopping 40 feet tall and loves the colour green (note hat, jacket and bow tie). He loves to follow up most statements by repeating his name twice (\"Grape Ape. Grape Ape\"). Along with his canine pal Beegle Beagle (or \"Beegley Beagley\" as our purple ape would say) the two roam through the country landing themselves in all sorts of zany situations. Luckily being a 40 foot purple ape means there aren't too many problems you just can't sit on.\n\nClue Club\n\n1976\n\nClue Club was a cartoon about four precocious young investigators (Dotty, Larry, D.D. and Pepper) who solved crimes with the help of two bloodhounds, Woofer and Whimper. Dotty, the brains of the team, would stay at home and analyze any clues that the gang found. The older dog, Woofer, thought he was a very good detective so he would always take the credit for solving the case. The laughs in the show were provided by Woofer and Whimper, due to their fear of the spooky places the gang went. The show only had one year of first run episodes, after which it aired in repeats on The Skatebirds under the new title Woofer and Whimper, Dog Detectives. These repeats were severely edited, which made the show particularly hard to follow. After a year on The Skatebirds, CBS reinstated the full episodes and re-ran them on Sundays under the original title. The show ran for another four months, cancelled in January of 1979. Theme Song: There they go, and on the double, to the spo\n\nCaptain Caveman and the Teen Angels\n\n1977\n\nThis animated series centers on the mystery-solving adventures of the Teen Angels (Brenda, Dee Dee and Taffy) and their friend Captain Caveman (or Cavey for short), a prehistoric caveman whom the girls discovered and thawed from a block of ice. Captain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his fur, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pops out different tools he uses to fight crime. Captain Caveman's voice was provided by Mel Blanc. The first and second seasons of the show were part of \"Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics\" and \"Scooby's All-Stars\" through 1979. Cavey and the girls also participated in sporting competitions as part of The Scooby Doobies team on the half-hour \"Laff-A-Lympics\" segment. In March 1980, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels were given their own half hour show with 16 new episodes combined with reruns from 1977–1979.\n\nCB Bears\n\n1977\n\nHustle (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Phil Silvers), Boogie (voiced by Chuck McCann) and Bump (voiced by Henry Corden) are a trio of funny animal bear detectives disguised as trash collectors. They travel the country solving mysteries in a tacky garbage truck. A sultry-voiced female named Charlie (voiced by Susan Davis) contacts the bears on the truck's CB radio to give them their assignments. This show was \"inspired\" by the hit TV series Charlie's Angels (Bump wore a blonde hairstyle similar to Farrah Fawcett). Each of the bears' names are based on a 1970s disco dance. Physically and personality-wise, Hustle, Boogie, and Bump resemble Hair Bear, Bubi Bear, and Square Bear, respectively, from Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!; Daws Butler provided the same Phil Silvers-esque voice for both Hustle and Hair.\n\nShake, Rattle, and Roll\n\n1977\n\nShake, Rattle, and Roll first aired in 1977 on NBC's \"CB Bears\" along with a segment called \"Heyyy it's the King\".

However even though they are able to scare possible guests away a man by the name of Sidney Merciless always ends up showing up to attempt to catch the ghosts in some sort of trap (most of the time in his fishing net). In most of these shows the main problem has nothing to do with human guests, but deals with their ghostly guests ranging from normal ghosts to a giant chicken monster.\n\nWonder Wheels\n\n1977\n\nWonder Wheels was a five-minute cartoon produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions which was originally broadcast as a segment on the CBS Saturday morning package program The Skatebirds (1977-78). A young journalist named Willie Sheeler (voiced by Micky Dolenz of the 1960s group The Monkees) and his girlfriend Dooley Lawrence solve crimes with the help of his superhero motorcycle, Wonder Wheels. Whenever Willie goes into action, he utters his catchphrase: \"This looks like a job for Won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-wonder Wheels!\". Then at the press of a button, Willie's beat-up motorcycle transforms into a souped-up version with a mind of its own.\n\nDinky Dog\n\n1978\n\nDinky Dog was an 11-minute animated segment on \"The All-New Popeye Hour.\" The show is about two girls, ditzy blonde Sandy and smart Monica, living with their uncle, Dudley.

Most episodes culminated in the Super Globetrotters challenging the villain and his henchmen to a basketball game for whatever treasure or device they sought. The civilian Globetrotters were always bested by the villains' super-powers in the first half, but they would use their own super-powers in the second half (often at the admonition of the Crime Globe) to save the day.\n\nSuper Friends (1980)\n\n1980\n\nRenamed Super Friends in 1980, the series changed formats again, abandoning the production of half-hour episodes and producing seven-minute shorts.
