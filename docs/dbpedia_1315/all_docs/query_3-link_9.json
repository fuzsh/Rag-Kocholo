        "text": "Released\n\nMarch 22, 2020\n\nRunning Time\n\n13:22\n\nLink\n\nPrevious\n\nBubsy, What Could Possibly Go Wrong?\n\nNext\n\nThe One Where Chandler Dies in Growing Pains\n\nBrad Jones: Oh, it's Yogi's Gang! Hang on, let me phrase this like I would whenever repeats of this show would pop up. *clears his throat and speaks in a less enthusiastic voice* Oh... it's Yogi's Gang. *voiceover* Years before crossover events like The Avengers, Batman v. Superman, or Out of Sight, we had the Hanna-Barbera smorgasbord of characters in Yogi's Gang, or as I used to refer to it as, Yogi's Ark. Yogi's Gang was a Saturday morning animated series that ran in the fall and winter of 1973, and featured such Hanna-Barbera characters such as Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Atom Ant, and who's this supposed to be... Squiddly Diddly? O-oh, that is his name. Touché Turtle. The show turns Yogi Bear into a paranoid, doomsday foreshadowing madman who encourages his friends to live with him on a giant ark that floats up in the sky.\n\nBrad: Yogi really was the Noah of his time, only if God wanted him to collect two of every picnic basket. *voiceover* It was one of the many environmental and socio-political shows of the time, as the gang would fight very socially recognizable villains such as the Envy Brothers, Smokestack Smog, the Sheikh of Selfishness, Hilarious P. Prankster...\n\nBrad: Stupid SJWs always inserting politics into our 70s cartoons, that's so 2020- wait, what? *voiceover* And I don't see the problem with Hilarious P. Prankster. Hilarious is in his name, that means his pranks were a success. The show debuted as an hour-long TV movie as part of the ABC Saturday Superstar Movie in 1972, which I'm sure was a great programming block, considering the first episode of that was The Brady Kids on Mysterious Island.\n\nBrad: I hope that was like Lost, and they end up getting eaten by the Smokestack Smog. *voiceover* Yogi's Gang aired there as Yogi's Ark Lark, which was renamed Yogi's Gang when it went to series. The hour-long TV special was split into two episodes in repeats, but the first episode of Yogi's Gang featured our ark larkers fighting against Dr. Bigot.\n\nBrad: Yes, Dr. Bigot. Subtle. But on the plus side, while he may be bigoted, he is smart enough to get a doctorate, apparently. *voiceover* Boy, am I getting flashbacks to having to watch this because nothing else was on.\n\nCut to the opening sequence of the show.\n\nBrad: Hey, remember in (One Flew Over the) Cuckoo's Nest when they all escaped and hung out on a boat? Well, just imagine that only if it were a flying ark. *voiceover* And then they take away Mr. Smog's smog. He needs that to live. That isn't very tolerable of you.\n\nBrad: The villains are just hanging out in the sky, as you do.\n\nHuckleberry Hound: *off-screen* It's Lotta Litter!\n\nYogi Bear: He-he-hey, we'll have to take care of her someway!\n\nYogi and Huckleberry Hound somehow pursue Lotta Litter in a street sweeper in the sky, who runs and hides in a floating trashcan.\n\nBrad: This also reminds me that vigilante movies were also really popular in the 70s. Yogi Bear was the Charles Bronson of killing litterbugs and people in planes.\n\nBoo-Boo: *off-screen* It's the Prankster and the Greedy Genie at 3 o'clock!\n\nYogi: He-he-hey, let's fix their clock!\n\nYogi presses a button, and a pair of giant flyswatters emerge from the ark, as well as a giant net to capture the villains.\n\nBrad: What the hell were they doing? They were just flying around like normal, sorta. *voiceover* The gang's all sailing around the world, high as hell, and the totally live studio audience must be, too.\n\nYogi: What's our heading, Huckleberry Hound?\n\nHuckleberry Hound: North by northwest, but on the other hand, it could be south by southeast.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* Beware the black cloud as well, because Dr. Bigot is so bigoted, he literally lives in a dark cloud. He must also be a vampire, he kind of looks like one. Is he Count Chocula? What does he have against our heroes?\n\nDr. Bigot: *speaking in an Eastern European accent* It's that sickening do-gooder bear and his crew of nice guys!\n\nBrad: *voiceover* Oh, they're a bunch of nice guys, that's why. Got to admit, I was getting a creeper vibe from them myself, just like these henchmen. What are their names? I'm gonna be sorry I asked.\n\nProfessor Haggling: Me Haggling, and him Bickering.\n\nProfessor Bickering: No, no! I'm Haggling, you're Bickering!\n\nProfessor Haggling: I am not!\n\nProfessor Bickering: You are, too!\n\nBrad: I don't think it's bigoted to not like these two. Even Mr. Rogers would be annoyed by them.\n\nProfessor Bickering: Well, wherever bigotry goes, Haggling and Bickering are sure to follow.\n\nCut to an image of Captain Planet and the Planeteers, as well as an image of Verminous Skumm from the show.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* Captain Planet is more subtle than this, and that has a character named Venomous (sic) Skumm. I don't know if everyone is having fun on Yogi's ark.\n\nYogi: Magilla Gorilla is runnin' out of fuel!\n\nCut to Magilla Gorilla running on a treadmill, which powers the ark itself.\n\nMagilla Gorilla: Time for a banana break! *grabs the last banana on the vine in front of him*\n\nBrad: Less jokes and more working. I don't know why; I just have the feeling that this inspired that Dolittle movie that just came out.\n\nCut to a screenshot of the 2020 film featuring the titular character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., as well as a gorilla. Meanwhile, Augie Doggie, Doggie Daddy, and Snagglepuss are mopping the floor when the ark suddenly falls underneath them.\n\nSnagglepuss: Heavens to Murgatroyd! Exit, stage bottom!\n\nBrad: Except the dialogue is way better in this one. *voiceover* Now they're gonna crash their ark into a small town. Good thing he's there to protect the environment. Yogi's more of a nuisance to this town than the dark bigot cloud.\n\nBrad: Relax, they're not gonna crash and die.\n\nYogi: How do you spring a leak on dry land? Can somebody explain this to a smarter than average bear?\n\nThe ark is suddenly revealed to be held in place by a water fountain.\n\nBrad: *sarcastic* Clearly this show teaches science, too! And who's this guy supposed to be?\n\nYogi: Who are you?\n\nMr. Cheerful: I'm Mr. Cheerful! Don't you remember me?\n\nBrad: I think the character names should be even more on-the-nose, as in just call him 'Mr. On-The-Nose'. *voiceover* He's a former visitor to Jellystone Park, and I don't think it's gonna be Dr. Bigot that upsets Mr. Cheerful.\n\nHuckleberry Hound: You're makin' me hungry!\n\nMagilla Gorilla: I resemble that remark!\n\nQuick Draw McGraw: I could eat a horse!\n\nPeter Potamus: You said a mouthful!\n\nBrad: It's gonna be jokes obviously written by Mr. Writer.\n\nCut to the IMDb page for the late Charles A. Nichols.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* As for the director, Charles Nichols, I don't see any connection to Denver the Last Dinosaur like my last couple episodes, but he did work on Dink the Little Dinosaur. Dr. Bigot wants to use his mind machine, with the secret ingredient of hate and prejudice, to ruin Mr. Cheerful. You see, kids, this was back when being a bigot solely meant hatred towards a group or individual, usually based on race or sex.\n\nBrad: Nowadays, it can mean something as little as making fun of movie or Twitter outrage. We've gotten really, really lax on the term, and if you disagree with me, you're a Nazi. *voiceover* The gang appears to be doing their own version of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Some of you may remember Mr. Cheerful voice John Stephenson as Mr. Slate from The Flintstones.\n\nCut to an image of the aforementioned character.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* Here, he's much more... for lack of a better word, cheerful.\n\nYogi's Gang: *singing* For he's a jolly good human, for he's a jolly good human!\n\nBrad: *voiceover* Stop sucking up, you already ate all of his sandwiches.\n\nCut to an image of the late actor, Henry Corden.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* The voice of Dr. Bigot is Henry Corden, known for taking over the role of Fred Flintstone after Alan Reed's death. Here, he's doing his best Professor Fate from The Great Race. He's gonna ruin brunch with his Bigot Beam. I'm not kidding.\n\nMr. Cheerful: *suddenly grouchy* You again! What do you moochers want this time?\n\nYogi: You invited the bunch for brunch!\n\nBrad: You may think the beam did that, but that's just the result of him starting a Twitter account.\n\nMr. Cheerful: Look at you! What a gruesome group! Some of you have spots, and others have stripes! Ugh!\n\nBrad: Don't worry about Mr. Cheerful, he'll just blame this on alcohol. He'll be back to making sandwiches in no time. *voiceover* How are our heroes gonna stop this bigotry?\n\nBoo-Boo: We'll let him take a rest, while we fix up his house!\n\nPeter Potamus: Yeah, we can mow his lawn!\n\nHuckleberry Hound: And trim his hedges!\n\nBrad: Sure, shave his pubes. That'll work. *voiceover* So they do a bunch of yardwork for him, in the hopes that he drops the whole bigotry thing. Fools, don't you know you're supposed to just scream at him online? That'll turn him into a better person. Or just mess with his house a little.\n\nAtom Ant: *under the front porch* OK, Huck!\n\nAtom Ant lifts up Mr. Cheerful's house, so Huckleberry Hound can rake the leaves under it.\n\nHuckleberry Hound: This sure beats sweepin' it under the rug!\n\nBrad: *voiceover* He's not even a bigot anymore. He's just mad they're ruining the structure of his house, destroying the resale value, and spraying him with a hose.\n\nYogi: I don't get it! What's with Mr. Cheerful?\n\nBoo-Boo: I still can't figure out what suddenly made him change like that.\n\nCut back to Snagglepuss accidentally spraying Mr. Cheerful with a hose.\n\nBrad: *voiceover, sarcastic* Yeah, what could it have been? Just give him the drugs you're all on. That'll chill him out.\n\nBoo-Boo: I've got it! We'll bake Mr. Cheerful a cake!\n\nYogi: He-he-hey!\n\nBrad: Why? He didn't beat (Super) Mario 64. *voiceover* Good, decorate it with the skiing ant. Yogi's against bigotry and the health inspector. \"Here's a cake covered in ant poop. Do you like us again?\" Must sound delicious to him, because Mr. Cheerful is back to normal. However, this gives me what I've wanted to see for years: bigoted Yogi Bear.\n\nYogi: *under the Bigot Beam's influence* I'm no friend of yours, fatso!\n\nYogi throws the cake on the ground.\n\nBrad: *snickers* OK, no more shit-talking this show. Yogi's Gang just got awesome!\n\nYogi: Cause that's the way I feel about all humans! Yech!\n\nPeter Potamus: Yogi, I've never seen you act this way before!\n\nCut to an image of Yogi running with a picnic basket while being pursued by Ranger Smith.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* He spent years stealing from humans, though. And he hates his other friends now, too.\n\nYogi: Imagine me, traveling around the world with such a raggedy group of animals!\n\nBrad: Well, some coked-up writer imagined it. *voiceover* Relax, karma's gonna come to Yogi when that Yogi Bear 3D movie comes out.\n\nCut to an image from the 2010 live-action/animated Yogi Bear film.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* I really don't wanna change Yogi back. If they kept him pissed off, I wouldn't have groaned whenever this show would come on. They figure out that the bigoted darkness is coming from the dark cloud. Gotta figure it out quick, the episode's almost over.\n\nBrad: You only have a little bit of time left to say the phrase, \"there goes the neighborhood\".\n\nProfessor Bickering: It's those creatures from the ark!\n\nProfessor Haggling: There goes the neighborhood.\n\nDr. Bigot: Don't worry!\n\nBrad: Thank you, now I know it's about bigotry. Show me Yogi getting pissed again!\n\nThe clip from earlier of Yogi throwing the cake on the ground is replayed.\n\nBrad: *snickers again* I just needed to watch that again. Please don't change him back. *voiceover* This is like Scooby-Doo if they didn't have to take a mask off of anyone and simply just figured out who it was by walking up to him. And shooting them with a reverse Bigot Beam.\n\nDr. Bigot: You have become friendly!\n\nProfessor Haggling: Maybe we can find somebody to be nice to.\n\nProfessor Bickering: Hey, that's a great idea!\n\nBrad: If only we had magic ray guns to put people into a nice-trance! That seems like a great idea. *voiceover* They don't even commit to this Stepford Wives brainwashing turn though, as they just leave Dr. Bigot as he is, angry and bigoted.\n\nBoo-Boo: So long, Dr. Bigot!\n\nBrad: I think they just left Dr. Bigot evil, so that they could use the line, \"So long, Dr. Bigot!\" *voiceover* Well, now that that's over, let's scarf down everything else from your fridge, and... bigotry is bad or something.\n\nBoo-Boo: We all have to carefully examine the thoughts we have in our own think tank.\n\nYogi: Yeah, that's pretty good, Boo-Boo! Now why didn't I think of that?\n\nBrad: Boo, that sounds hard. Just shoot me with a ray gun and turn me nice. I'm tired of throwing cakes on my neighbor's porch. *voiceover* So that does it for the adventures of Yogi Bear, and Dr. Bigot, and Mr. Cheerful, and... god damn. It's like the characters were named by a church youth group minister who does puppet shows for 5-year-olds. As I said earlier, I do love Yogi Bear. Yet, I would roll my eyes when this show would come on. I'd be excited at first thinking, \"Oh sweet! Yogi is on!\" But as soon as I saw that ark, I had to prepare myself for the Hanna-Barbera equivalent of a Just Say No to Drugs ad. Reruns of the show not only used to run on Nickelodeon, but on USA'S Cartoon Express as well. Presumably, when the ark would break down and they'd have to hitch a ride on the cartoon version of the Snowpiercer. You know you're gonna get germs on that thing, and there's probably a lot of litter on it. It's not that something like this isn't well-intentioned, and it goes without saying it'd be a little pandering. But when it's this obvious, it comes across more as patronizing, and that you think your audience is stupid, it doesn't know what words are. The only way a kid would like this isn't if it were on Saturday mornings, it's if your grade-school teacher was showing it to you in class, which means, \"Yay, no schoolwork for the day!\" If this were any more 70s, it'd take place in space, another Hanna-Barbera gimmick at the time.\n\nCut to the title card for Casper and the Angels, as well as a promotional flyer for Yogi's Space Race.\n\nBrad: *voiceover* Oh, wait. There was a Yogi space show: 1978's Yogi's Space Race!\n\nBrad: Well, if Yogi's Gang taught me anything, it's if you don't like that show, you're a space racist! *chuckles* Great. Now I've got these writers writing for my show as well."
