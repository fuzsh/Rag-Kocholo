        "text": "Casper and the Angels (1979)\n\nCasper the Friendly Ghost was a guardian angel for two female motorcycle space cops named Minnie (who was rather ditzy and had a Southern accent) and Maxie (who was a much more intelligent African-American woman) in the year 2179. They were joined by a rambunctious ghost named Hairy Scary, who would scare villains and troublemakers, but unlike most other ghosts, was accepting of the fact that Casper was a gentle ghost who did not like to scare people.\n\nShow Info\n\nAired on:\n\nNBC, US\n\nRuntime:\n\n15 min.\n\nStatus:\n\nCanceled/Ended\n\nRating:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 0/5 (0 ratings)\n\nMore Info:\n\nIMDb | TheTVDB\n\nStats\n\nPremiered:\n\n1979\n\nEnded:\n\n1979\n\nEpisodes:\n\n28\n\nWatchlists:\n\n12\n\nEpisodes Guide and Summaries\n\nCast\n\nJulie McWhirter\n\nas Casper\n\nJohn Stephenson\n\nas Hairy Scarey\n\nJohn Stephenson\n\nas Commander\n\nDiann McCannon\n\nas Space Patrol Officer Maxi\n\nLaurel Page\n\nas Space Patrol Officer Mini\n\nHal Smith\n\nas Nerdley\n\nPaul Winchell\n\nas Fungo\n\nPlease login to access advanced features like popularity charts.
