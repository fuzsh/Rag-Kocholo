A retro-hip situation comedy set in the era of bell-bottoms, smile buttons and 8-tracks, FEELIN' ALL RIGHT is a nostalgic and funny flashback to the \"Me\" decade from celebrated comedy producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner (\"Roseanne,\" \"The Cosby Show\"), along with Bonnie and Terry Turner, the wildly clever creators of \"3rd Rock From The Sun.\" Too groovy for the rural Wisconsin suburbs where he lives under the authority of his parents RED and KITTY 17-year-old Eric yearns for his independence but coming of age isn't all that easy at a time when polyester and mood rings are the epitome of cool. Together with his friends -- including Eric's next door neighbor DONNA, who has a crush on him; KELSO, a good-looking guy who's not the brightest lava lamp in the shop; JACKIE, Kelso's spoiled girlfriend; HYDE, a paranoid conspiracy theorist, and FEZ, a confused foreign-exchange student Eric does his best to prove that the kids really are feelin' all right.\n\nHOLDING THE BABY\n\nWhat happens when a workaholic dad discovers that his wife has run off with her yoga instructor and the nanny has deserted him? He is literally left HOLDING THE BABY. Conceived by writer/executive producer Howard J. Morris (\"Home Improvement,\" \"Dream On\"), HOLDING THE BABY presents a comical crash course in single parenting for GORDON STILES, a charming, fast-talking salesman whose skills unfortunately don't translate very well to fatherhood. While he dazzles his clients, he is absolutely clueless about how to make his son DANIEL eat strained peas. Having gone through a succession of live-in nannies (thanks in part to his partyboy brother JIMMY's penchant for climbing into bed with them in the middle of the night), Gordon is desperate to find a permanent replacement. It is then that he mistakes KELLY O'MALLEY, an adorable but opinionated graduate student, for the latest applicant sent by the nanny service. He proceeds to dump Daniel off on her and sprint into a business meeting before she can clear up the misunderstanding. Kelly surprises herself -- and Gordon -- when she taps into her maternal instincts while caring for baby Daniel.\n\nHOLLYWEIRD\n\nExecutive producers Wes Craven (\"Scream,\" \"Scream 2\") and Shaun Cassidy (\"American Gothic\" and \"Roar\") combine their sense of comic-scary-cool in this homage to the weird: HOLLYWEIRD. Three Midwest teens wind up take their local cable show on the road, only to wind up in Hollywood where their weekly chronicle of unsolved Hollywood murders puts them smack in the middle of life at its most bizarre. The three filmmakers-turned-investigators CARIL ANN, CHARLIE and TREY find themselves caught on the dark side of the City of Angels, typically reserved for those who would rather only come out at night. Forged with the same sly pop culture references and topical turns as \"Scream,\" HOLLYWEIRD takes its characters on a weekly tour of Hollywood's hottest spots, leaving audiences captivated in the process.\n\nLIVING IN CAPTIVITY\n\nExecutive producers Diane English and Joel Shukovsky, the phenomenal creative team which brought us inside the Washington Media in \"Murphy Brown,\" now takes us on a wild ride into a place even more cunning and conniving than Capitol Hill -- the Suburbs. Welcome to LIVING IN CAPTIVITY, a brash, edgy look at one neighborhood's warped pursuit of the American Dream. Attempting to escape the stress of the big city, upwardly-mobile professionals CURTIS COOKE and his very pregnant wife, TAMARA, relocate to Woodland Heights, a planned community complete with beautiful homes, lush landscaping and picket fences. They think they've found paradise in this quiet suburban oasis...that is, until they meet their neighbors. Next door lives CARMINE \"The King of Mufflers\" SANTUCCI and his trophy wife, LISA. Carmine, who has all the makings of FOX's new Al Bundy, single-handedly sets political correctness back about 50 years. Also in the neighborhood is WILL MAREK, a fragile house-husband and novelist who has developed chronic writer's block ever since he and his attorney wife, BECCA, moved out of the city. LIVING IN CAPTIVITY is an outrageous comedy that presents an uncompromising, contemporary take on suburbia, where the American Dream quite often turns out to be a nightmare.\n\nMid-season Replacements\n\nTHE PJs\n\nNone other than comic genius Eddie Murphy brings us this latest masterpiece, a \"Foamation\" take on urban family values set in The Projects, for which it is named. Murphy provides not only the voice for the lead character, building superintendent THURGOOD STUBBS, but also the sweeping comic vision and cultural insight that drives the series. Like KING OF THE HILL or THE SIMPSONS at their best, Thurgood and his extended family skewer cultural stereotypes, sacred cows and notions of political correctness as we've never seen before. THE PJs marks Eddie Murphy's return to series television since creating some of \"Saturday Nights Live's\" most classic characters Buckwheat, Gumby and James Brown, to name a few. It also represents renowned filmmakers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer's (\"Apollo 13,\" \"The Nutty Professor\") entry as executive producers on this Imagine Entertainment half-hour. THE PJ's is as visually unique as anything to hit primetime, and employs the masterful Will Vinton Studios (\"California Raisins\") exclusive stop-motion technique known as \"Foamation.\" Loaded with timely, pop cultural references, THE PJs is sure to strike a chord with anyone who likes their social satire a bit askew but always dead-on.\n\nFUTURAMA\n\nMatt Groening, the multiple Emmy Award-winning creator of THE SIMPSONS (the longest-running sitcom on television and the longest-running primetime animated show of all time), has hatched another outrageous, animated primetime half-hour, FUTURAMA. But we're not in Springfield anymore. People may look out-of-this-world, but FUTURAMA is set on Earth, a thousand years from now, and it's like no future you've ever imagined. FRY is a 20th century \"Everyman\" who manages to escape his lackluster life when he finds himself 1,000 years in the future. Making friends with a robot named BENDER and meeting a beautiful woman named LEELA, Fry realizes that the future holds some major changes, but life's everyday challenges and joys still hold true. And, of course, traffic is still a bitch. With his unique satirical humor and distinctive style, Groening has created another unconventional, hysterical and lovable group of characters that will make us look, and laugh, at ourselves.\n\nFAMILY GUY\n\nCreator Seth MacFarlane serves up a hip, hilarious and satirical slice of family life in FAMILY GUY, an animated sitcom featuring an outrageous cast of personalities who, despite their silliness, sympathetically mirror our own real-life American families. Led by thick-headed dad PETER GRIFFIN, who is as tactless as he is clueless, this not-quite-so-average family unit of middle-class New Englanders proves to be delightfully dysfunctional. Even his harried wife LOIS, who struggles desperately to maintain a modicum of normality in their home life, can't seem to control him. Rounding out the Griffin household are their children: angst-ridden teen queen MEG; eighth grader CHRIS, an overweight underachiever; and baby STEWIE, a cute, clever 2-1/2-year-old who already has his mind set on world conquest. And then there's BRIAN, the brainiest of the bunch, who also happens to be the family dog. Well-spoken, well-read and a wellspring of sarcasm, he longs to be surrounded by intellectual equals. Domestic bliss is amiss in the '90s as FAMILY GUY presents the everyday trials and tribulations of family life, but with the distinctively exaggerated twist and quirky slant that only animation can provide.\n\nApril 1, 1998\n\nShows in development for next season:\n\nBrimstone about an ex-cop who caputres escaped souls Blade Squad -- police on in-line skates Invisible Man -- based on the classic story Ghost Cop -- a female cop and a ghost work together 900 Lives of Jackie Frye about a greeting card company Five Houses about a gay couple in the suburbs\n\nSignificant Others has been taken off the schedule.
