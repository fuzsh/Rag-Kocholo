        "text": "An embarrassing (?), incomplete list of popular films I’ve not seen\n\nYes, this is a film blog… albeit a blog dedicated to older movies. I try to watch more pre-1980 movies than post-1980 movies each year, so this of course means there are major newer titles that I have never gotten around to and are somehow still on my watchlist. So I guess that’s sort of embarrassing? My rationale sometimes is that those truly popular post-1980 movies - because they are on TV so much - make me think: “Oh, they’ll always be on TV so I can wait a bit longer.” Movies that are the beginning of long franchises I haven’t begun are things I avoid for some strange reason. The 1980s are also my least favorite decade of filmmaking. In addition, it should be noted I was a sensitive child. There are many R-rated movies from the 1980s-late 2000s I’ve never seen because I was sheltered and I was easily scared.\n\nFor my energetic, vocal followers who are versed in Indian cinema… there are no Indian movies down here. I’m not embarrassed over my lack of knowledge in Indian cinema because the lack of availability and platforms to access in the U.S.\n\nAnyways I’m rambling. Here’s a list of movies I’m sort of embarrassed - I really shouldn’t be, though - to not have seen by this point. I’ve done this sort of list before, but I can’t find the post. So I expect all of you to lose trust in my movie tastes and expertise after reading this! I’ll try to explain what’s preventing me from seeing some of these, too. Without further ado (in chronological order and most embarrassing bolded… so I guess the juiciest stuff that most of my followers will be aghast at will be at the bottom):\n\nLittle Caesar (1931)… “Is this the end of Rico?” I wouldn’t know! This iconic gangster movie’s been on my watchlist forever.\n\nTarzan the Ape Man (1932)… The Weissmuller Tarzan is on TCM so often. Because I know it’s a long-running series makes me less-hesitant to get into it.\n\nScrewball comedies including: Libeled Lady (1936), My Man Godfrey (1936), The Philadelphia Story (1940; oh my god it’s always on TCM too)\n\nAngels with Dirty Faces (1938)\n\nGentleman’s Agreement (1947)\n\nSansho the Bailiff (1954, Japan)… so. much. praise.\n\nSeven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)… I mean, knowing the premise, I’m preparing for it to be really meh despite Stanley Donen directing (if you say so @halfwaythruthedark)\n\nOklahoma! (1955)… not really familiar with this R&H musical in the first place\n\nTwo Federico Fellini films in particular: La Dolce Vita (1960, Italy) and 8½ (1963, Italy)… I’ve seen plenty of his stuff but these are glaring holes\n\nIt’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963)\n\nAndrei Rublev (1966, Soviet Union)\n\nThe Omen (1976)\n\nAnimal House (1978)… okay okay Little Red Reading Hood (you know who you are) get ready to be horrified even more in a few moments\n\nCaddyshack (1980)\n\nThe Shining (1980)… I’ve seen bits and parts but otherwise I’ve refused to watch it because I don’t want it being chopped up by commercials\n\nThe Thing (1982)… because I really like the original and I’m meh on John Carpenter\n\nFlashdance (1983)… because if there’s anything that can make me roll my eyes and sort of enjoy at the same time… it’s ‘80s power ballads. Like Seven Brides, I’m expecting this to suck hard.\n\nFootloose (1984)… ffs\n\nGhostBusters (1984)… never been a Bill Murray fan and it’s ALWAYS on television (I’m procrastinating, remember)\n\nThe NeverEnding Story (1984)… too many friends have grown up with it and I’ve never gotten around to it\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America (1984)\n\nThe Black Cauldron (1985)… here only because I wanna stick it to my Disney-loving friends\n\nBlue Velvet (1986)… not a fan of David Lynch… so am I missing out on something?\n\nTop Gun (1986)… great soundtrack but… do I have to? :|\n\nDirty Dancing (1987)… *grumbles about ‘80s power ballads again*\n\nFull Metal Jacket (1987)… seen in parts. I’m Viet-American and I hate Vietnam War movies. And I do not like the parts that I have seen.\n\nDie Hard (1988)… the recent movement proclaiming this as the best Christmas movie ever is pissing the hell off of me. I don’t care if this might be the action movie ever… that kind of fanboyish behavior is off-putting.\n\nGhost (1990)… because all of the folks a generation above me in the family have seen it. Whoopi is always a plus, but I don’t care for Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore?\n\nFree Willy (1993)\n\nGroundhog Day (1993)… see GhostBusters\n\nMrs. Doubtfire (1993)… I’ve seen more than half of it but never all the way through\n\nChungking Express (1994, Hong Kong)\n\nDumb and Dumber (1994)… I don’t like Jim Carrey. It’s something that will come up later in this list.\n\nBraveheart (1995)… referenced so often but Mel Gibson? *sigh*\n\nCasper (1995)\n\nGhost in the Shell (1995, Japan)… a lot of anime-centric fans have badgered me with this one over the years\n\nJumanji (1995)… it scared the heck out of me when I was younger and I never completed it\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)… haven’t seen a single Austin Powers movie all the way through. Something tells me it may not be worth it.\n\nThe Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)… I actually only saw the first movie in late 2013. Too frightened of dinosaurs when I was younger. And a lot of people I know have seen the sequel.\n\nThe Big Lebowski (1998)… this is a biggie. I know it’s Coen Brothers. I know it’s supposed to be really funny, but it’s really hard for me to like a raunchy comedy… is it witty and intelligent? Maybe a good message?\n\nThe Truman Show (1998)… people have tried to describe this to me but it never makes any sense each time they try. I dislike Jim Carrey and think his brand of humor is on the cruel, hyperactive side.\n\nFight Club (1999)… because fuck David Fincher (those are three words that could get me in serious trouble with fanboys) and all the toxic masculinity in his movies not nearly as well-critiqued as people think\n\nThe Green Mile (1999)… it was big with dad and my uncles back in the day… the 3+ hour runtime for a movie that isn’t an epic is keeping me away\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999)… Remember I was a sheltered, easily-scareable kid!\n\nX-Men (2000)… I’ve never seen the one that started it all. Superhero media has never been something I’ve sought too much. Even as a young kid.\n\nAmélie (2001, France)… it’s just not been available on any platform that I have access to and I prefer to see non-English language movies legally if I can (supehero movies though? fuck it I’ll theater hop; Marvel doesn’t need more money)\n\nMoulin Rouge! (2001)… a few of my friends love it. I’m skeptical of Baz Luhrmann movies always.\n\nCity of God (2002, Brazil)… see explanation for Amélie\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)… chalk it up to Jim Carrey and me being sheltered\n\nRent (2005)… lots of girls in middle school and high school liked this movie. Its popularity drew me away from it.\n\nBefore you doth protest too much, remember that this blog is concentrated on pre-1980 stuff and I limit my post-1980 movie consumption so that I’m well-rounded chronologically and can understand film history better. I’ve seen plenty of obscure stuff that should find a larger audience, regardless of how old that movie is, and I promote those movies a lot. And considering Roger Ebert passed away having never seen The Sound of Music (1965) and I’m only in my mid-20s? I’m not doing too bad."
