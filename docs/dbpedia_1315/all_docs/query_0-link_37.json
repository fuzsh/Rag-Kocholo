        "text": "Results\n\nOf the17 women eligible for our study, one declined as she did not want to revisit the difficult period of her treatment, leaving a total of 16 participants. On average, the participants were 60 years old (range 37–72) and 5 years post breast cancer diagnosis (range 4–8) ( ). More than half of the women had obtained a two-year college degree or less (n=12) and reported incomes of under $30,000 per year (n=9). Nine of the participants were married.\n\nTable 3\n\nCharacteristicsN = 16Age in years, mean ± SD (range)59.88 ±8.85 (37 – 42)Years since diagnosis, mean ± SD (range)5.41± 1.24 (3.9 – 7.6)Education, n (%) Some high school3 (18.8) High school graduate4 (25) Two-year degree5 (31.3) Four-year degree2 (12.5) Masters2 (12.5)Incomea n (%) Less than $10,0001 (6.3) $10,000 – $19,9996 (37.5) $20,000 – $29,9992 (12.5) $30,000 – $39,9991 (6.3) $40,000 +2 (12.5)Marital Status, n (%) Married9 (56.3) Single5 (31.3) Divorced1 (6.3) Widowed1 (6.3)\n\nIn analyzing the transcripts of the interviews, we identified three core themes related to the experience of support by African American women breast cancer survivors: “I guess she was supposed to”: When support meets patient expectations; “I wasn’t expecting that and that just made me feel so good”: When reality exceeds expectations; and “Don’t try to make an invalid out of me”: When support given wasn’t what was desired.

The participants had very clear conceptualizations of what the role of each person in their breast cancer experience should be, and the types of support they should provide. When each person gave support that was expected from the role they played in the participant’s life, the support was perceived as positive and helpful. For the participant’s healthcare providers, including physicians, nurses, social workers, and pharmacists, the support given was perceived to be a part of their job description; as Lenora, a 61 year old survivor related: “I got answers for everything just about that I needed to know….I guess she (the nurse) was supposed to.” Thus, the participants conceptualized support from the healthcare providers to mean the provision of information and advice related to their illness and management of treatment side effects. The women often referred to healthcare providers giving them targeted information that was pro-active and pre-emptive, so that the women would not be “shocked” or caught off guard by changes that were likely to occur in their bodies. When the women heeded the provider’s advice or information, and found it to be helpful and/or accurate, it added to the healthcare providers’ credibility:\n\nHe (the oncologist) recommended different support groups at (the cancer center). He recommended for me to attend a class on lymphedema. He recommended me to attend a class on make-up application and wig selections, if I choose to wear a wig and that type thing. That was really helpful because I did it all. (Lissa, age 58, 7 year post-diagnosis) I received a lot of information, printout information and stuff, and if I had any questions, I was given a number that I called. When I went to the hospital to have my port put in and everything, they were real nice there. They sent me a lot of information and I had a person that if I had any questions she was right there for me. All I had to do was make a phone call and, anything I needed, she was right there. (Lydia, age 52, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nThe participants expected their family to not only encourage them to seek medical guidance, but also to support—with unquestioning acceptance—the physician’s recommended treatment plan The survivors’ equated this lack of questioning about treatment decisions from their family with inherent support:\n\nI just happened to be feeling up there and just kind of felt this lump and then one of my daughters said, ‘You should go see Dr. Garvin, and that’s what I did. (Frankie, age 66, business owner)\n\nNobody doubted me and told me, “No, I wouldn’t do this, I wouldn’t do that.” I didn’t have that. And I have heard a lot of people say that’s what they went through. They was, “I wouldn’t go through with this”, but I didn’t have that. I had the support. (Daisy, age 66, 7 years post-diagnosis)\n\nWell, I had support of my family, but they didn’t necessarily help me decide my treatment. Only my doctor and I decided that. So, but, I had good family support and I told them what treatments the doctor had recommended, so they were very supportive of that. They didn’t ask any questions about that. (Lissa, age 58, 7 years post-diagnosis)\n\nThe participants also expected and appreciated receiving instrumental support, such as transportation to and from clinic visits and treatment sessions, meal preparation, house cleaning, and assistance with activities of daily living, from family members and friends. Family members and friends often coordinated and scheduled instrumental support activities to assist the participants with doing “whatever you needed them to do:”\n\nYeah, my cousins and my…husband he went sometimes…and my son and my cousin and my daughters…they took me and they took me. They wouldn’t let me drive. They would take me all the time to the treatments and everything. They was very helpful. (Flossie, age 72, 4 years post-diagnosis)\n\nYou really need the participation of everybody when you go through the treatment. It’s not something you can just say, I’m going to stand alone on this one, because you can’t. You pretty much need everybody. So, that’s why I pretty much had to involve them. And my sisters. I got, my sisters, I got brothers. My family was there, nieces, whoever. It’s like whoever you call did whatever you needed them to do. (Zora, age 50, 4 years post-diagnosis)\n\nSpiritual support was an integral to most of the participants’ experiences, often sensed through their own personal connection with God, the presence of clergy and others with similar spiritual beliefs (i.e., family members). The participants anticipated and received support throughout the diagnostic, treatment, and recovery phases from these spiritually supportive individuals, who shared Bible verses, prayer, and affirmations that God puts you through these things to make you a better person (Lydia). Despite the uncertainty surrounding transitions through breast cancer treatment, this type of spiritual support provided survivors with assurance that their treatment outcome would be favorable:\n\nHe (her pastor) prayed and said everything was going to be alright and just do as they say do and not try to listen to other people in the street. (Eddie, age 37, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nWhat’s my best support, was knowing that God was going to see me through. (Diane, 64 years old, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nMy church members. They was just there! And really and truly, they were, ‘how you feel today?’ I said, ‘Oh I feel wonderful.’ I said, ‘and I thank God every day, for a new day, because it’s a day I’ve never seen before’. (Minnie, age 62, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\n“I wasn’t expecting that and that just made me feel so good”: When reality exceeds expectations\n\nA unique finding of this study was the consistent identification of healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers, support group leaders) as more than just providers of health care, but as substantial and integral sources of support in these women’s lives. The participants expressed surprise and delight with how their providers encouraged and cared for them beyond what they expected. The participants saw their providers as friends, who often engendered trust and connectivity by sharing personal stories and experiences with breast cancer suffered by their own family members:\n\n(My doctor) said that my mother was lost (he also cared for the participant’s mother who died of breast cancer) and he did not want to lose me…that saved my life. (Katie Mae, age 54, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nHe [my doctor] said, ‘you’ll be fine’. The doctor that he referred me to was actually…actually treated his wife and, of course his wife passed away, but he said she lived a long time. She did very well up under him, and he ended up sending me to the same doctor. And, that kind of eased my mind… because he shared his personal experience with me and that made a difference with my treatment. (Eddie, age 56, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nOnce trust was established, the participants framed the little things that their healthcare providers did and said as positive, welcomed support. Participants commented on how their healthcare providers were consistently available and willing to engage with them at “anytime.” Rather than a delineated, patient-provider relationship, their providers encouraged and fostered sincere and caring relationships with them:\n\nShe (support group mentor) really encourage me…she was my friend…I just looked forward to seeing her (Katie Mae, a 54 year old, 5 years post-diagnosis).\n\nYeah, I had the same two nurses the entire time. If one was out of vacation, then the other nurses would fill in and come and help, but the whole time they made the experience smooth. They told me to call them anytime. Even right now, I still call them. They just built that kind of rapport with us…with me, with all the patients, and they said anytime I had a question or wanted to know anything, to just call and they would be willing to talk to me and help me out. (Eddie, age 56, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nHe (oncologist) had given me a lot of support and hope. After I had my last treatment, he give me a big hug and told me, he said, now you need to get out of here because there’s a lot of sick people we need to take care of. I don’t think you sick, though. You go and be blessed and enjoy your life. So, that was hope. (Daisy, age 66, 8 years post-diagnosis)\n\n“Don’t try to make an invalid out of me”: When support given wasn’t what was desired\n\nThe participants as a whole expressed that they had received overwhelmingly positive support from their healthcare providers, family members, friends, and clergy. However, participants also described instances where the support offered did not fit the perceived needs or expectations of the participant. From the participant’s perspective, there was a mismatch between the type of support being offered and the person offering it. This mismatch occurred if the participant expected a certain person to provide a specific type of support and they failed to do so. For example, Diane, a 64 year old, related a friend’s cancer story of the doctor not doing what he supposed to do as a bitter experience. The mismatch also occurred if a specific person offered support that the participant felt was someone else’s role. As described previously, for our participants, treatment decision making was done primarily by the physician, with occasional and rare input from the participant. When family members (versus healthcare providers) tried to take on the role of providing informational support, their suggestions regarding treatment options were perceived as unhelpful:\n\nI got a lot of suggestions about doing something else and taking some kind of pills or medicine some other way, …one of my relatives that made that suggestion. I just wanted to follow the instruction of Dr. Porter, what he said. (Frankie, age 66, 7 years post-diagnosis)\n\nWhat often led to these mismatches in support was that family members and friends were unaware of the participant’s changing conceptualizations of what support was, and how much they needed:\n\nMy husband would say do what you have to do, you know, but that’s not enough and I felt alone, very alone with that one. (Ella, age 64, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\nMy children, my pastor, I mean they just came by. My deacons and, oh my God! When you see all the love and it just make you wanna do. And sometimes I have to say, oh now, it’s time for ya’ll to leave…Then say, “well, I need a little rest”, but they the next day they’re right back. (Minnie, age 62, 5 years post-diagnosis)\n\n(Everyone was) trying to do too much…sometimes you just have to say ‘back off, I’m okay’. (Shelly Ann, age 64, 6 years post-diagnosis)\n\nThis lack of awareness on the part of family members and friends was at times even more problematic, leading participants to feeling compelled to give support rather than receive it. Some made decisions to suppress the truth about their experience with cancer in order to provide emotional support to their family members:\n\nI didn’t tell them nothing [about the cancer diagnosis] because I don’t them to be moping and crying over me, so I didn’t tell them. (Liza Jane, age 70, 7 years post-diagnosis)\n\nI think she’s [referring to her daughter] angry, too, that I got sick.… She really feels that God turned his back on me because I was her mother and I was just a good mother and…she thinks that shouldn’t have happened to me. So, around her, I have to pretend that I’ve overcome it and it’s just a game that you sometimes win and you sometimes lose. (Etta, age 65, 4 years post-diagnosis)\n\nA particularly poignant experience for these breast cancer survivors was the loss of support after completion of treatment. Even though it was a happy time, the lingering fear that the cancer could recur was ever-present. Some participants experienced a sense of disconnection from their family members and friends, while others expressed a discrepancy between how they thought they should feel, and their current reality. Knowing that other women had gone through similar experiences and seemed so happy made this feeling of loss especially difficult:\n\nI’m still here, and I’ve finished my treatment, I’ve finished the chemo. I look at some woman on TV and they have been through it and they seem so happy that they went through it and on the other side and I feel like I’m still stuck there. I feel like I’m still stuck there. When is the joy going to come? (Etta, age 65, 4 years post-diagnosis)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis qualitative study explored African American breast cancer survivors’ recollected experiences with and perceptions of support during diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. The emergence of our main themes from participant narratives illustrates how social support is not merely a unidirectional process assumed as inherently acceptable simply because it was offered. Rather, support is a process of bidirectional negotiation where the overall perception of social support as helpful and acceptable depends on who is offering the support, what type of support is being offered, and when it is being offered. By applying the lens of transitions theory, we found that African American breast cancer survivors’ perceptions of social support offered by their family, friends and health care providers varied based on the presence of transition properties and the intersections between them.\n\nAwareness and engagement were transition properties consistently observed in participant narratives where social support met expectations. In order for support to meet expectations, three conditions had to be met. First, the survivor and the individual providing the support had to be aware of the survivor’s need for support. Second, the individual had to offer the type of support that the survivor desired at that time. Third, the support had to be offered by the individual in the survivor’s social network that the survivor expected it to come from. From the narratives in this study it seemed that survivors expected healthcare providers to offer informational support, and family and friends to provide instrumental and emotional support. For example, survivors described demonstrations of nonverbal emotional support when their families “did whatever you needed them to do,” or clergy reminded them “God was going to see me through.” This finding aligns with the seminal work of Helgeson and Cohen (Helgeson and Cohen 1996) which discussed how cancer survivors expected and desired certain types of support to come from key individuals in their lives (e.g., desired emotional support from family and friends, etc.).\n\nComparatively, awareness and engagement were also consistent properties for when support exceeded the participant’s expectation. An interesting observation within this theme was that participants primarily described exceptional support as coming from cancer care professionals (e.g., nurses, support group mentor, etc.) versus their family or friends. This finding resonates with Schulz (Schulz et al. 2008) where African American cancer patients discussed how much they valued the support of their treatment team, with one patient illustrating the notion of support exceeding their expectations by describing their nurse as their “guardian angel.” Unlike some other forms of medical care, in oncology cancer care professionals have frequent contact with patients, providing an ongoing opportunity for patients to develop trust. As survivors in this study were control participants who did not receive benefit of the previous intervention (Heiney et al. 2012), this clearly improved relations with cancer care team members. Additionally, cancer care providers and professionals are highly knowledgeable and aware of the ongoing physical and psychological effects that a cancer diagnosis and its treatments can have on a patient. Their high level of awareness prepares them to anticipate and attend to the evolving supportive needs that survivors may experience over time.\n\nAn additional explanation for why participants may have viewed support from cancer care professionals as exceptional may be related to the power differential between the patients the professionals. All of our participants were African American and more than half of them reported annual incomes of less than $30,000 per year; this difference in status had the potential to add to their perceptions of vulnerability during the course of their interactions with healthcare professionals. Further, limited information from the survivors’ medical records indicated that some of their surgeons and medical oncologists were African American men; thus, potential racial and/or gender differences in the survivor-provider relationship may have also contributed to these perceptions. Given the life-threatening nature of a cancer diagnosis, cancer patients may feel an urgent need to quickly establish trust in their oncologist regarding the diagnosis and treatment plan (Hillen et al. 2012). As noted previously, the survivors were very grateful for this type of support from their providers. However, their pleasant surprise of the additional, emotional engagement the providers established with them may have been related to the survivors having no expectations for receiving the type of support they generally expected to come from their family, friends, and clergy.\n\nWhen the survivors’ support needs were unmet, the data subcategories we identified were associated with a much more complex intersection of transition properties that the participants, family, and friends were required to negotiate. In addition to awareness and engagement, critical points and events, change and difference and time span emerged as important transitions framework properties. A common element of these three properties is an indication of some sort of “shift” in the life of the survivor, whether brought on by an identifiable moment (e.g., cancer diagnosis, completion of treatment), change in perception (e.g., when survivor wanted to do more for themselves versus receive support from others) or time span (e.g., state of feeling disconnected from “happy survivors” on television versus reality of feeling loss). This theme demonstrated that the survivor’s supportive needs were unmet when they themselves, their family members, or healthcare providers were unaware of or failed to recognize the survivor’s supportive needs may change in various situations. Survivors in our study revealed that there were times they did not tell their family and friends that they needed some other form of support because they did not want to be a burden. Similar to the concept of “meddling” that emerged from previous research with African American cancer survivors (Schulz et al. 2008), our participants confronted difference when family members offered support that was dissonant to their needs or provided support that discounted their ability to care of themselves. In these situations, survivors changed their perceptions of what type of support they needed, shifting from dependence on their family members for emotional or instrumental support to more of a sense of independence. However, the survivors’ desire for independence was also mixed with feelings of loss of support when transitioning from active treatment. Completion of treatment is a critical event in the breast cancer journey, where survivors shift from engaging with cancer care providers on a daily to weekly basis, to every 3, 6 or even 12 months. This change in care resulted in survivors and members of their social network being unaware of and unprepared for the potential impact that this transition could have on the survivors’ perceptions of and expectation for support from others.\n\nPractice Implications\n\nCancer survivor outcomes are optimal when their care is being coordinated by a comprehensive team of providers across specialties (e.g., oncology, primary care), disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, social work) and institutional settings (e.g., academic or community cancer centers) (McCabe et al. 2013). These Providers can mediate conversations between breast cancer survivors and members of their social support network (e.g., family members, friends, clergy) about what supportive role the survivor expects each person to play. Providers can initiate these conversations by administering social support assessments throughout the breast cancer experience, and especially during critical moments, such as the point of diagnosis, completion of treatment, and recovery period. Providers should create space and time for this conversation to be iterative and ongoing, underscoring that the survivor’s needs, abilities and expectations for support are likely to change and vary over time. The survivor’s multidisciplinary care team are best suited to determine who, how and when these conversations should be initiated.\n\nTransitions theory suggests key facilitators, such as preparation and knowledge and community conditions (Meleis et al. 2000), that providers can implement to enhance transitions of support for breast cancer survivors. Acts of preparation and knowledge could include providers not only giving anticipatory guidance on physical changes that a patient might experience, but also informing them about changes they may experience in their familial and social relationships during their cancer journey. Providers may also want to prepare survivors for the possibility that their experiences with breast cancer may differ from what they see in popular media. Training for survivors should focus on increasing their skills and ability to negotiate the support that they need at a given time and make it clear to family, friends and providers that those needs may change over time (Hoffman, Lent, and Raque-Bogdan 2013). In addition to survivors, providers should assess the survivor’s community conditions, which includes their familial or spiritual sources of social support. Members of their social networks should be educated on how to be aware and intuitive in their offers of support, and flexible with the survivor as to what levels of support they desire as they move into longer-term survivorship.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding African American women breast cancer survivors’ perceptions of social support within the context of transitions theory provides a framework for ensuring that their needs and expectations for support are met during their cancer experience. Our findings highlight that survivors perceive support as helpful when they receive the right type of support from the right person at the right time. Otherwise, survivors may perceive the support given as unhelpful which could lead to unintended consequences, such as greater emotional distress. Family, friends and health care providers should be encouraged to periodically assess the survivor’s evolving needs to ensure the social support they receive is the support they desire."
