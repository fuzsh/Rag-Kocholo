        "text": "Casper is the spooky family-friendly comedy that tells the heartwarming story of a friendly ghost and the unlikely bond he forms with Kat (Christina Ricci), the daughter of paranormal expert Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman). Casper (Malachi Pearson) lives in a grand mansion called Whipstaff Manor along with his three ghostly Uncles, Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso. Driven by the desire to communicate with his deceased wife, Dr. Harvey embarks on a quest to rid Whipstaff Manor of its ghostly inhabitants. However, Kat befriends Casper and is determined to help him find peace.\n\nCasper is a family-friendly staple that has remained popular with audiences since the 90s due to its timeless themes of friendship, love, and the importance of embracing one's true self. The enchanting portrayal of Casper's character, along with the charismatic performances by Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci, adds to the film's charm and appeal.\n\nCasper’s special effects have actually held up for its time, seamlessly blending live-action with CGI to bring the ghosts and supernatural elements to life.\n\nOur Casper facts include how it had the most impressive CGI of the time, which cast member forgot they were actually in the film, and why Christina Ricci found Casper problematic.\n\n1. Casper Is Based On The Character From Harvey Comics\n\nCasper, released in 1995, is based on the character Casper the Friendly Ghost from Harvey Comics, created by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo. The movie stars Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, and Eric Idle. Additionally, it features the voice talents of Joe Nipote, Joe Alaskey, Brad Garrett, and introduces Malachi Pearson as Casper.\n\n2. The First Film To Have A Fully CGI Character In A Leading Role\n\nCasper utilises ground-breaking computer-generated imagery (CGI) to bring the ghosts to life, making it the first movie to have a fully CGI character in a leading role. Unlike previous adaptations in comics, cartoons, and films, Casper takes a darker approach to the Friendly Ghost, exploring themes of death and delving into the character's tragic backstory.\n\n3. Casper Earned US$287.9M On A $55M Budget\n\nCasper was distributed by Universal Pictures and hit theatres on May 26, 1995. The movie received mixed reviews from critics. While they praised its faithfulness to the source material, particularly in the portrayal of the title character, as well as its visual effects, music score, and performances, they criticised its dark storyline and humour. Nonetheless, the film was a financial success, earning $287.9 million on a $55 million budget.\n\n4. Casper Has Two Prequels And An Animated Spin Off\n\nThe popularity of Casper led to the creation of two indirect prequels, Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper Meets Wendy (1998), released by 20th Century Fox as direct-to-video or made-for-TV movies. Additionally, an animated television spin-off called The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper was produced.\n\n5. Casper Takes Place In Friendship, Maine\n\nCasper takes place in Friendship, Maine, following the death of Carrigan Crittenden's father. Carrigan, a neurotic and spoiled heiress, inherits only Whipstaff Manor in her father's will, while his substantial wealth goes to various charities. Alongside her lawyer, Dibs, Carrigan discovers a map hidden in the will's papers, which supposedly leads to a hidden treasure within the haunted manor. However, they encounter Casper, a friendly ghost, and his mischievous uncles, the Ghostly Trio, who haunt the property. Carrigan and Dibs' attempts to expel the ghosts using paranormal experts and a demolition team prove futile.\n\n6. Steven Spielberg Had Plans To Adapt Casper The Friendly Ghost\n\nProducer Steven Spielberg had plans for a film adaptation of Casper the Friendly Ghost. After seeing an episode of the television series Brooklyn Bridge directed by Brad Silberling, he recognized Silberling's potential and enlisted him as the director for Casper. Initially, Alex Proyas had been signed on as the director but left due to creative differences with the screenplay. In an interview, Proyas expressed his interest in creating a darker film in the vein of The Wizard of Oz.\n\n7. J.J. Abrams Contributed To Casper As An Uncredited Writer\n\nJ.J. Abrams also contributed to the script as an uncredited writer on the film Casper.\n\n8. Casper’s Backstory Differs In The Film And The Comics\n\nThe screenplay provided a backstory for Casper, presenting him as the ghost of Casper McFadden, a boy who died of pneumonia at the age of 12. However, some comic iterations, particularly those from the 1960s, depicted him as a ghost born to ghost parents.\n\n9. Steven Spielberg Was Meant To Cameo In Casper\n\nIn one scene, there was originally a cameo planned for director Spielberg, who was supposed to transform into Dr. Harvey in a mirror. However, the scene was ultimately cut for pacing reasons, much to Spielberg's relief as he admitted feeling uncomfortable in front of the camera. Principal photography took place from January 27, 1994, to June 8, 1994.\n\n10. Casper’s Soundtrack Was Composed By Amblin Entertainment’s James Horner\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed James Horner, known for his work on various Amblin Entertainment films like \"An American Tail\" and \"The Land Before Time.\" The track \"One Last Wish\" gained recognition as it became part of Universal Pictures' \"Logos Through Time\" Montage, celebrating the studio's centennial anniversary.\n\nAnother track, \"Descent into Lazarus,\" was featured in a trailer for Universal Pictures' film \"The Grinch,\" also composed by James Horner.\n\nThe soundtrack was reissued in a commemorative twenty-fifth anniversary edition by La-La Land Records on August 4, 2020, after its original release on April 29, 1995, preceding the film by nearly five weeks.\n\n11. Casper Was Released On VHS And LaserDisc\n\nCasper was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 10, 1995, followed by a DVD release on September 23, 2003.\n\n12. Casper Claimed The Number One Position On It’s Debut Weekend\n\nDuring its debut over the Memorial Day weekend, Casper claimed the top spot at the box office, earning $16.8 million in its first three days from 2,714 cinemas, with an average of $6,205 per cinema. Over four days, it accumulated $22.1 million, averaging $8,140 per cinema.\n\nThe film maintained its #1 position in the second weekend, adding another $13.4 million and reaching a cumulative total of $38.9 million in just ten days.\n\nIt continued to perform well throughout the summer, ultimately grossing $100.3 million in North America and an additional $187.6 million internationally, resulting in a worldwide total of $287.9 million. The film surpassed its $55 million budget, establishing itself as a commercial success.\n\n13. Casper Has A 51% Approval Rating On Rotten Tomatoes\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 51% approval rating based on 41 professional reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10.\n\nThe site’s critical consensus states that the film is a \"meandering, mindless family movie that frequently relies on special effects and transparent sappiness.\"\n\n14. Critics Found Casper To Be Middle Of The Road\n\nThe film received acclaim for its cutting-edge CGI effects, which were considered groundbreaking at the time. The performances of the main cast were also praised, particularly given the challenging nature of their interactions with the ghosts.\n\nLeonard Maltin, in his 2015 Movie Guide, gave the film a \"BOMB\" rating, expressing his objection to the portrayal of Casper as a deceased child rather than a traditional ghost.\n\n15. Pullman And Ricci Had To Act With Stand In Maquettes\n\nIn scenes where the Harveys interacted with the ghosts, actors Pullman and Ricci had to act with nothing or stand-in maquettes used as references for the animators. The pair also had to interact with tennis balls instead of the ghosts, as the ghosts were added in during post-production.\n\n16. Casper Launched Brad Silberling’s Directorial Career\n\nThe success of Casper solidified Silberling's directorial career, leading him to helm the 1998 film \"City of Angels,\" a remake of \"Wings of Desire\" starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.\n\n17.
