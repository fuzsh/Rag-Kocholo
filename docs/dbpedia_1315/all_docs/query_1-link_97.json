        "text": "Casper sadly did not respond to treatment, despite the best efforts of the zoo’s expert vet team and their specialist colleagues to intervene.\n\nThe zoo ultimately made the “difficult decision”, in conjunction with its vet team, to put him to sleep in the interest of his welfare.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nLlandudno community centre steps up security after Southport events\n\nColwyn Bay girl to face tandem bike challenge across Holland with dad\n\nRecruitment starts at Betws-y-Coed hotel undergoing full revamp\n\nChris Mitchell, chief executive officer of the Welsh Mountain Zoo, said: “Casper the California Sea Lion was a much-loved part of the zoo family, and we are all deeply saddened to share the news of his passing.\n\n“Casper is survived by his family Spray, Sofia, Cali and Monty.\n\n“We ask that you keep them and Casper’s care team in your thoughts at this difficult time. He will be greatly missed.”\n\nPeople paid tribute to Casper on the Welsh Mountain Zoo’s Facebook page following the news.\n\nCelise Neal wrote: “I remember Casper from my time at the zoo. He was a beautiful big boy with lots of personality.”\n\nLaura-Jane Devey said: “We came on June 22, and Casper was loving life and was so active. He was the highlight of our day. I couldn't believe how big he was.”\n\nChristine Marsh added: “My heart goes out to the keepers. Casper was a joy to behold. It was the highlight of my visit to watch him float past the window as I drank my hot chocolate.\n\n“I had the privilege of feeding the sea lions as a Christmas gift and it was so special. I am devastated, and visits will never be the same.”\n\nMatthew Brown described Casper as “stunning”, and said he had a “smashing personality”, meanwhile."
