        "text": "UPDATE\n\nThe new Angel Moroni statue for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ temple in Afton, Wyoming, was installed Tuesday.\n\nThe project was supposed to happen on Monday, but was delayed due to weather, according to multiple people in the area.\n\nThe old statue was damaged in a lightning storm several months ago, which is why it was replaced.\n\n“(It) blackened part of the backside of (it),” Temple President Kirk Hathaway told SVI News. “You can hardly tell where it is unless you’re looking for it. Our Temple Facilities Manager … noticed there was blackening on it, and so it was determined … that we should replace it.”\n\nSee the statue in a video here.\n\nThe Star Valley Temple became the church’s first temple in the Cowboy state when it was completed in 2016.\n\nA public open house and tour of the Casper, Wyoming Temple is scheduled to begin on August 29. It will be dedicated on Oct. 13 by LDS Apostle Quentin L. Cook, according to SVI News.\n\nThe Cody, Wyoming Temple, which was announced in 2021, is awaiting construction, pending a court proceeding.\n\nORIGINAL STORY\n\nAFTON, Wyoming (SVI News) – The Angel Moroni statue that sits atop The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ Star Valley, Wyoming Temple in Afton was replaced Monday.\n\nReplacement work got underway at noon and took about four hours to complete.\n\nThe reason for the replacement was due to a lightning strike several months ago.\n\n“(It) blackened part of the backside of (it),” said Temple President Kirk Hathaway. “You can hardly tell where it is unless you’re looking for it. Our Temple Facilities Manager … noticed there was blackening on it, and so it was determined … that we should replace it.”\n\nTwo large cranes were used on the project. One crane removed the damaged statue and replaced it with the new one. The second crane lifted a facilities crew member to the statue, and secured it in place.\n\nThe temple grounds were closed Monday during the project. Many people watched from a distance while it was in progress.\n\n“I’m hoping that people will use common sense and be safe around there while it’s going on,” Hathaway said ahead of the statue’s replacement. “There will be a lot of people driving back and forth on the highway, and I would hate for anyone to have an accident while watching the Angel Moroni being replaced.”"
