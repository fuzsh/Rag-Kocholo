        "text": "Are any of the Hellraisers after the first worth watching? I thought that one was okay, but the ending was a total WTF. Is that ever explained?\n\nInteresting poster.\n\nThe left side reads,\n\n\"A devil? An angel? Or is he a monster!?\"\n\n(化け物, the last one, could be translated as a number of things)\n\nAs already said, the second one is a direct continuation and the story was from Clive Barker, who both wrote/direcited the first one, and also made the excellent Nightbreed movie.\n\nThe third one is also worth watching to a lesser extent, but it has some great new Cenobite designs in it and some good practical effects work, the story isn't bad (but it's not as good either as the first two), it delves more into Pinhead and his origins. After this one is when the series goes downhill fast.\n\nEven more disappointing is that Clive Barker actually wrote a new Hellrasier a few years back and even got Doug Bradley (the actor that played Pinhead, though he hasn't for years now) to agree to reprise the role. He turned the script in and the studio literally ghosted him and made Judgement (the newest one) instead, which was terrible.\n\nOctober 6, 2019\n\n6. Nightmare Cinema (first watch, Apple TV)\n\nFive different strangers find their way into an abandoned cinema and the Projectionist plays out a specific nightmare for each person that turn out to be more real than just a movie...\n\nAn anthology movie with five different stories by five different directors. The stories play out like homages to other horror movies as well as horror concepts and frightening psychological drama. Each one is different and done pretty well. The actors are fine, and, there are a few that are recognizable. One being the Projectionist. The movie was an entertaining watch. It was nice, as with most anthology movies, to see how the directors played out their scenarios for each character and to see the creativity with each story. I really like the concept of the Projectionist and this Nightmare Cinema and would really like to see a version done with a bigger studio and a bigger budget.\n\n- 6/10\n\n8.) Duel (1971)\n\nSpielberg's full-length directorial debut is a tense thriller anchored by a strong lead and an emotionless force in pursuit of him. Lots of fun paranoia!\n\n4/5\n\n9.) Ma (2019)\n\nSure the trailers gave away 90% of this movie but it was still a fun ride. Octavia Spencer is really the drawing force here and she elevates what would have been an otherwise bland and forgettable movie. I also always love to see Juliette Lewis, even if she was mostly underused here.\n\n3.5/5\n\n10.) Wrong Turn 2 (2007)\n\nThis direct to DVD sequel is somehow even more fun than the first. Closer looks at the mutated cannibal hillbillies, better characters, better death scenes. Henry Rollins is incredible.\n\n4/5\n\n11.) I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu (2019)\n\nLast year I watched all four previous ISOYG films. The original is great, the remake was decent, the unrelated sequel to the remake is great, and the fourth film which is a direct sequel to the remake is just alright. This film is a direct sequel to the original film from the seventies and what words can I find to describe it?\n\nAbhorrent, torturous, mind-numbing, contrived, a waste of time, shit, likely the worst film I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. Camille Keaton returns as Jennifer Hills, now a bestselling author of a novel recounting her rape and eventual satisfying revenge against her assailants. The actress is now in her seventies and looks and sounds it. She still has a decent scream, though. What passes for a plot in this film is spread like the thinnest of whispy hairs across a goddamn two and a half hour runtime. It's like an ambitious film student ran amok, painfully dragging out every scene as if to make the audience suffer as the characters do. At one point an actress has a soliloquy in front of a grave that is meant to endear us to the rapists from not only this film but ALSO the original. This scene goes on for, I kid you not, a nearly uninterrupted three minutes. It's torturous. Every vague plot thread drags on, allowing the viewer to truly absorb all the bland scenery and extensive melodramatic overacting of most of the cast. The foot-dragging pace and absurdly high number of scenes that serve no other purpose other than to humanize the RAPISTS both past and present combined with special effect makeup and prosthetics that I personally can and have executed better make this a film that you should forget ever exists. If somebody even thinks for a moment about mentioning it, run as far away as possible. Avoid at all costs.\n\n0/5\n\n5. Dark Water (2002)\n\nThink I recall seeing promos of the american remake of this film way back, and after all of this time, I have come around to the original while looking for an Asian horror film on Shudder. Bit of a gloomy story about a mother trying to hold it together to keep custody of her daughter during a divorce, and course they move into a place that is haunted.\n\nI think the relationship between Yoshimi and Ikuko was pretty good, along with a running theme of a kid waiting for their parent. And then there is the spirit itself has a eerie presence for a while, until things get terrifying at the end. Even then, it's a film that is more sad than scary, and oh man was the ending so damn wonderful. This is another horror film that cause me to shed some tears.\n\nFirst double-feature of the marathon, a pair of found footage films I've been meaning to get around to.\n\n#6 - Creep 2\n\nCreep 2 is fascinating. I liked the first film, it was simple yet effective and I figured this one would be more of the same. I wasn't expecting the story of an aging serial killer, who has lost his love for murder, engaging in a quirky and awkward sort of friendship with one of his potential victims. It's an interesting premise; there's some uniqueness here that allows this follow-up to really stand on its own, unlike a standard copy/paste sequel. Got a kick out of how the protagonist wasn't at all bothered by the attempts to scare her or make her uncomfortable, really liked her character. Interesting sequel, maybe better than the first film.\n\n#6.5 - Grave Encounters\n\nThe spookiest film of the marathon so far. I wish the effects could've been better, though I understand they had a small budget. Grave Encounters isn't the most original thing in the world - it's got a spooky asylum full of spooky ghosts and characters that make bad decisions, but it's still an entertaining watch. There were some good scares and I'm a sucker for impossible space in horror films, it's so trippy and unsettling and I love it. Extra points for that.\n\nI thought this movie was The Beyond, but it looks like I was mistaken. Can anyone help me remember what's the movie with the woman whose apartment is a gateway to hell? I just remember the jump scare with a pale white man in his underwear walking out from behind a door and then standing in the corner. late 70's or early 80's.\n\nI thought I had seen this, but going by the trailer... maybe not. Probably just saw a clip on that Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments once upon a time and mixed it up with something else in my memory. Just going by the trailer, it looks like something that probably got built up during the vhs days when it was rarer and harder to find.\n\nYou're actually thinking about The Sentinel, which I coincidentally just watched. It was on that Bravo countdown, specifically the moment you're talking about.\n\n5. Dark Water (2002)\n\nThink I recall seeing promos of the american remake of this film way back, and after all of this time, I have come around to the original while looking for an Asian horror film on Shudder. Bit of a gloomy story about a mother trying to hold it together to keep custody of her daughter during a divorce, and course they move into a place that is haunted.\n\nI think the relationship between Yoshimi and Ikuko was pretty good, along with a running theme of a kid waiting for their parent. And then there is the spirit itself has a eerie presence for a while, until things get terrifying at the end. Even then, it's a film that is more sad than scary, and oh man was the ending so damn wonderful. This is another horror film that cause me to shed some tears.\n\nAfter I watched that movie, I learned about Elisa Lam's death and felt terrified and horrible for her.\n\nCaught up and I can now join in. I'm trying to watch horror films I haven't seen before and I'm limited to the streaming services I have access to, so no rentals if possible.\n\nHere's what I watched last year-\n\n1-22\n\n23-25\n\n26-27\n\n28-29\n\n30-32\n\n2019-\n\n1. Candyman =3.5 out of 5\n\nWell made, I just wanted more as I felt it was too short and some things could have been developed more. The acting is fine outside of the husband. The ending and the nature of the urban legend was a bit confusing.\n\n2. The Invitation = 1.5 out of 5\n\nSlow, meandering & illogical. It never surprises or expands on expectations.\n\nThe last 20 minutes falls apart under scrutiny and it has a lame twist ending. 75 minutes of wondering if this is a study of someone growing dangerously paranoid after surpassing extreme grief for it just to be a Heaven's Gate style cult that turns psychotically violent at the drop of a hat.\n\nWhy show your guests the video, play the \"I Want\" game or bring up the cult at all if you weren't going to give them the opportunity to choice to die with you and then just resorting to secret poisoning and murder. I felt so detached watching this. Frustrating.\n\n3. Ju-on the Curse 1 & 2 = 3.5 out of 5\n\nI really liked Ju-on the Grudge 1 & 2 when I watched them last October and these lower budget earlier movies in the series are very effective at setting a mood of dark things happening to likable ordinary people.\n\n4. Return of the Living Dead 3 = 1 out of 5\n\nEven worse than part 2. Cheap, dumb, melodramatic and humorless. The zombies look shitty and most of them are slow. The body mutilation and cover image is one scene over an hour in. The original Return of the Living Dead is a favorite of mine, this is just awful.\n\nThis just reaffirms that I don't care for director Brian Yuzna's work and that Stuart Gordon was probably responsible for Reanimator being so great.\n\n5. The Hills Have Eyes (1977) = 2 out of 5\n\nThe tension and unease created by the soundtrack and beginning of the movie dissipate quickly with bad acting, poorly drawn and annoying characters. It abruptly ends too. The dog was a highlight though so an extra star.\n\n6. Marebito = 3 out of 5\n\nA bleak movie staring Tetsuo the Iron Man director Shinyo Tsukamoto having a dark, existential crisis. Pretty interesting and a little surreal. It held my attention, but I don't think I'd re-watch it.\n\n7. Suspiria (1977) = 3.5 out of 5\n\nI'd been putting off watching this for a long time as I assumed the English dub was a bastardization and was looking for the subbed version.\n\nCool shots and visuals with a unique soundtrack that calls attention to itself. Uneven, but cool to finally see what the fuss was about even if it was a bit disappointing.\n\nOh i love these threads every year. I dont think ill be able to make it through 31 movies this year due to planning a vacation to new orleans in Oct (one of the most haunted cities in america), but i do think ill try to watch some movies. Stoked for my vacation though. Were going to that serial killer museum, taking a cemetary and ghost/vampire tour, and going out to the bayou. All fun horror ish things.\n\nSo far I've watched the following:\n\nTrick R Treat: Totally loved this one, and I never saw it before. Only complaint was they showed one of the villians faces.... i wish it stayed a mystery as it was way spookier.\n\nHalloween 2018: Watched it for the second time with my girlfriend (her first time), still holds up and was pretty solid for a remake... im looking forward to seeing what they do with the sequel.\n\nAmerican Werewolf in London: I haven't seen this in maybe a decade and it was my gfs first time seeing it. I dont think i remember how funny this movie was. By far one of the best written horror comedies in my opinion. This really is a classic\n\nContinuing my list from last week:\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (70s one) - First time seeing this... man this movies fantastic. i want to watch it again, but to me this is up there with alot of other 80s horror (the thing, alien, etc). Really a fun ride and some amazing casting and a fun plot. overall really enjoyed it. really recommend watching this if you haven't seen it already.\n\nScream - one of those movies i always thought ive seen but i dont believe i have. really a fun ride, and some fun twist. might give some of the sequels a shot. also wasn't expecting all the humor throughout. it almost makes the scary movie parody unnecessary lol.\n\nAlso not a movie, but finished watching Mindhunter on netflix. I highly recommend this to everyone. Great to watch around this time of year. First episode is a bit slow, but then it really picks up\n\nNon-31 Days HorrorWatch:\n\nThe Beyond (1981)\n\nSince I'm watching House by the Cemetery this marathon, thought I should revisit the other two movies in the trilogy. There's something undeniable about Fulci's horror movies that draw me back to them even though I find their plots and pacing unappealing. From a narrative perspective, The Beyond is a mess of random horrors, dull characters, and myriad other annoyances that makes it frustrating to sit through.\n\nAnd yet...as a surreal nightmare of cursed happenings and gruesome death, The Beyond is enthralling. Fulci crafts an unforgettable canvas of mood and supernatural doom, where horrific gore and rot, mangled corpses rising, face-devouring tarantulas, and doorways to beyond coalesce in a hellish erosion of normalcy. Oddly enough, I'm reminded of Hereditary and its inescapable occult vice. Hauntings aren't enough; no, in The Beyond, it's as if the universe is against these people, hell itself corrupting their lives. What should seem like gratuitous excuses for practical effect showcases - who keeps a jar of acid on the top shelf? - instead come across as infernal influence unleashed upon hopeless protagonists. Mess with demonic relics, suffer the consequences: the cold antediluvian mathematics of damnation. In some ways, it makes the inexplicable zombies and weird fates and ghosts and arachnid hordes feel cohesive in a cosmic horror kind of way. Or maybe that's me trying to rationalize the odd appeal of these movies.\n\n#6. Hellraiser: Judgement - I was made aware of this film right at the end of the marathon thread last year and put it on my list for this year. I've watched the previous 9 so I may as well watch this one. It's probably the best one since Inferno but that is low fucking praise. The opening of the movie had some decent creepy imagery and the cenobite that conducted the interviews was fun. Then it puddles into the human story which is boring and doesn't even bother trying to hide where it's going. I do have to give some praise to the actor who plays Pinhead. He's no Doug Bradley but he actually does give a pretty decent performance and was a massive improvement over the guy in Revelations. This movie introduces some heaven stuff into the lore; unless previous movies did that and I've forgotten. Either way, I doubt they're planning to do anything with it in a sequel. So long Hellraiser till the next time the rights are about to run out.\n\n#05 - The Crazies (1973)\n\nI really wanted to have this post-Night, pre-Dawn George A. Romero flick in my marathon this year. And while I love both those movies, and this definitely has some similarities (especially with Dawn), it just wasn't all that great and did not click with me. It was actually kind of cheap/amateur in some ways, which got me annoyed. Just like the characters, the viewer is left in the dark with what is exactly is going on, which partially works but also had me questioning a lot of aspects of the story. There is a lot of military folks talking to each other over the radio about military stuff and military bureaucracy and every time they do it the soundtrack plays this military drum song which, once you start noticing it, is super annoying. There's a lot of yelling and screaming, and annoying characters talking to fill up the time without actually saying anything. 4/10\n\nI also watched the 2010 remake which I liked slightly more.\n\nActually ended up watching two horror films last night but was too tired to add the 2nd one\n\n7. The Conjuring 2\n\nI think I prefer the first Conjuring film to this one but this is still a good film. The nice part about all of these films in the Conjuring Cinematic Universe is that the characters are likeable so when shit goes bad you're not going \"awesome I hope they die\" like you would in most slashers these days or any Eli Roth film. The nun remains a creepy-ass monster design and after seeing all of the spinoffs it's cool to see how these are come together. This is probably the third best cinematic universe behind Marvel and the original Universal Monsters universe. The plot in this one can drag a bit during some of the character development moments but it's still cool to see it averting or playing with tropes like the Cop Are Useless trope being used in a way I haven't seen since that Casper movie from the 90s\n\nWatched Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth again as part of my October spooks. I'd see it once before.\n\nThe Hellraiser films make me sad. I'd never seen a single one until three years ago because I just assume they were all just another mad man slasher films like Jason or Michael Myers. However I decided to jump in a few years back and I was blown away by Hellraiser 1 and since i've watched it yearly and it's one of my favourites of all time - Fantastic premise, awesome make up and special effects which still look good today, great direction from Clive (I wish he directed more films) and just overall a great simple dark film, set in a relatively small space.\n\nHellraiser 2, while still a great film doesn't live up to the simplicity of the first for me. But again, great special effects, some interesting deeper lore which helps you understand the world better.\n\nThen from 3 on wards, it just goes down hill. 3 is just a campy, silly movie. Doug Bradley is the only thing that remains decent in the films, and i'm surprised he did so many. I've seen 4 and 5 then stopped a few years ago. I might rent Hellraiser 6 for jokes because I saw Ashley Laurence is in it again, but apparently it sucks still.\n\nIt's a huge shame because the premise is cool and the franchise has such great potential. I wish they can get something proper made as I hear a new one is in the works, but i'll probably be another direct to dvd movie.\n\nActually ended up watching two horror films last night but was too tired to add the 2nd one\n\n7. The Conjuring 2\n\nI think I prefer the first Conjuring film to this one but this is still a good film. The nice part about all of these films in the Conjuring Cinematic Universe is that the characters are likeable so when shit goes bad you're not going \"awesome I hope they die\" like you would in most slashers these days or any Eli Roth film. The nun remains a creepy-ass monster design and after seeing all of the spinoffs it's cool to see how these are come together.

The plot in this one can drag a bit during some of the character development moments but it's still cool to see it averting or playing with tropes like the Cop Are Useless trope being used in a way I haven't seen since that Casper movie from the 90s\n\nI still can't believe The Conjuring developed into a full-blown cinematic universe!\n\n6) Rosemary´s baby (1968)\n\nI feel extremely ambivalent about this movie. On one hand, it is clearly an extremely well made movie, with great pacing and an escalating sense of paranoia. I was really aching with empathy for Mia Farrow´s character all the way to the end credits. On the other hand, the knowledge of the director just poisoned the whole experience for me. Even attempting to separate the art and the artist is impossible for me in this case, as there is such a close tie between the themes of the movie and the crime Polanski committed. So much of the horror of the movie arises from the violation and suppression of bodily autonomy of the main female character, and the parallels to the real life story were just impossible to avoid thinking of.\n\nThe gas lighting and trivialisation of marital rape also make the movie an uncomfortable watch regardless of all the other outside context (though to be fair, that is probably mostly intentional). If it was made by someone else, with less baggage attached, I would not have been as conflicted. Even then, these types of stories always tend to be emotionally draining for me, and I need to be in a particular mood to really enjoy them.\n\nFilm 08 - House of 1000 Corpses\n\nIt's Sunday, and I'm having a rest from the Nazi menace that I've been dealing with so far this month, which means it's time for a Sid Haig tribute viewing.\n\nThis is a rewatch, but it's been a while since I saw it last. Captain Spaulding's presence hangs so heavily over the Firefly family movies that I'd forgotten he isn't really in this film much after the first act. What a fine first act it is though, with Haig's performance in particular a thing of true beauty.\n\nThe movie loses it's way a little bit when the action switches to the Firefly family home, but the nightmarish final twenty minutes retain their queasy power. Its illustrious sequel is rightly considered a better film, but House of 1000 Corpses is still a great horror movie, especially for a dyed-in-the-wool Rob Zombie fan like me.\n\nVerdict: Highly recommended.\n\nFilms I've seen so far\n\n100% agree. I've really come to appreciate HO1C over the years. When it was new, I mostly thought it was weird and uneven, but man have I come around on it and now I really love it. I know its been said, but Captain Spaulding is such an amazing character and he really makes the first two firefly movies. He's just so damn disarming but then vicious and man does Sid Haig nail the part. There's never going to be another character like him. He's iconic.\n\n7) Hellraiser: Deader (2005)\n\nConditions of the nerve endings the likes of which your imagination could not evoke.\n\nHellraiser: (Increasingly) Deader, what a name. That said, I think an improvement from the last few direct to video entries. Following a reporter investigating a cult seemingly about killing and resurrecting its followers, the film has a dedication to being as grimy and slimy as possible. Scenes constantly buzz with insects and drip with blood or other such liquids. This does help it have a slightly more Hellraiser atmosphere, which aids the obligatory tacked in Hellraiser parts in feeling a little more at home (once again, it's an unrelated script rewritten to be a sequel). We still have a lot of the same gruesome hallucinations and extended dream sequences, but they're not quite as frequent as in Hellseeker where it was just tiresome.\n\nHowever, this one definitely felt the crunch of time. Even though it's the usual 90 minute runtime, it takes a slow pace to the point that the plot felt like it was only just coalescing when I looked at the time and saw only twenty minutes left. Sure enough, the third act is super rushed and much of the proceedings going unexplained or very underdeveloped.\n\nAll in all, while better than the last couple of entries, I'd still just call it \"watchable\".\n\n​\n\nOctober 7th: Night Killer (1990)\n\nWell that was tortuous. I had hopes that this Severin release might offer something absurd, as it was recommended for fans of Troll 2. It's trash cinema, that's for sure.\n\nNight Killer is about a masked serial killer with a claw glove that likes to rip his claw through human torso's. Because a fake claw can rip through a body like swiss cheese, didn't you know? There is a decent opening in an auditorium with some terrible dancing sequences, as the Night Killer takes his first few victims.\n\nThe story then takes focus on Melanie Beck, a woman suffering from suicidal thoughts and depression. So let's have the Night Killer invade her home and torment her for hours. The feel good movie of the year. She survives but has no recollection of what happened to her, which is troubling for detectives as she is the only person who knows what the Night Killer really looks like.\n\nThe Night Killer kills a few more poor souls. Then I fell asleep. Thank God. When I woke up, Melanie remembers who the Night Killer is and is able to take him out along with her new boyfriend Axel. There is a decent ending that I'll put in spoiler tags so you don't have to suffer a watch of this thing:\n\nMelanie and Axel have a daughter. For Christmas, the daughter opens up a present in her room. It's the Night Killer mask! She puts it on, and babbles about how the Night Killer is back for revenge. Oh no!\n\nI have no idea why, but this was released in Italy as Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3. Hmm, there are no chainsaws but alrighty then. Also, I don't think the Night Killer ever kills anyone at night. Hilarious.\n\n2/10\n\n#06 - Christine (1983)\n\nChristine is a pretty sweet car with an outgoing personality, which, at a especially terrific turning point in the movie, shows what she's all about, her true identity as she turns into an evil killing machine. Her owner Arnie also has a transformation of sorts troughout the movie as he goes from dork to evil Fonz. Well directed, lovely action scenes and terrific sounddesign. SPeaking of, I really dug the rocking soundtrack (with some lovely Carpenter synths to go along with it). Which also brings me to something that might turn out to be quite a problem guys, I am running low on John Carpenter movies I haven't seen yet. 7/10\n\nIt's difficult to confirm some of the things I've read about what they did to the cars exactly in this movie, but I believe there were 24 cars in the film, including 16 '58 Plymouth Furies, as well as some '57 Furies, Plymouth Savoys, and Plymouth Belvederes all fashioned to look like '58 Furies. Allegedly, only three mint \"Christines\" survived (and one extra was restored). 15% of the film's budget was also ostensibly used on the cars. (Sorry for all the \"supposed\" info, but I have never found reliable sources.)"
