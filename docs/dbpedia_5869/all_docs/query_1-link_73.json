        "text": "At the dawn of western civilization, Aristotle reasoned that private property rights were something natural and good. He believed that exterior goods were natural to man and necessary for, what Aristotle would consider the ultimate good of mankind, happiness. Soon thereafter, Christianity would take hold on civilization and a new idea of common property would come with it. However, St. Thomas Aquinas would argue on the foundation of Aristotle that private property was welcome in Christianity. He wrote that as long as one saw God as the sovereign creator of all things and was willing to relinquish his property to the poor, that private property was then good and natural. A century later, the poet Dante Alighieri would argue that private property was not just good and natural, but also sacred. He wrote that man’s creation was, “God’s Grandchild” and as such must be respected as something unique, beautiful, and holy. Through his poetry and political writings, he would cast those who plundered private property into one of the lowest levels of hell. With a study of these three great men and their works, one can clearly see an evolution in economic thought on the issue of property rights.\n\nEconomics was traditionally viewed as part of a wider study of human things, including ethics. Ethics studies values and virtues. The objective of this study to discuss ideas in economics in ancient, medieval and modern times context ethical issues. The first attempts to analyze economic problems appear in the writings of the ancient Greeks. Plato recognized the economic basis of social life. Aristotle attributed great importance to economic security as the basis for social and political health. Roman writers such as Cicero, Vergil and Varro gave significant advice about the economic agriculture. The medieval period was marked by the disruption of the flourishing commerce of the ancient world, and its economic life was dominated by feudalism. Mercantilism economic system of the major trading nations based on the premise that national wealth and power were the best served by increasing exports and collecting precious metals in return. Physiocrats regarded agriculture as the sole prod...\n\nCertain economic concepts discussed in Summa Theologiae, are inherently analysed in the debate related to virtues and vices, in a theory of the individual‟s moral faith. We could thus argue that Thomas Aquinas was not directly concerned with the analysis of economic mechanisms, nor with the research of prosperity means of nations and peoples, but attempted to find out what was ethically correct, the economic thinking being subordinated to morality. Starting from Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas made a distinction between „Artes possessivae vel aquisitivae‟ - consumable goods producing activities and „Artes pecuniativae‟ - those being exclusively profit-seeking. Aristotle was condemning „the pure chrematistics‟; Thomas Aquinas (in the Middle Ages) – at the confrontation between scholastics and early capitalism ideas - he preferred the „possessivae‟ arts instead of „lucrativae‟ arts, without the latter being absolutely sentenced. Essentially, we note that, in Summa Theologiae, the economic i...\n\nThis paper discusses some of the qualities of that liminal sphere created by the practice of what is formally known as the principle of economy. This is done by reconstructing three pivotal moments in its pre-modern history. The first is found in the First Canon of Basil the Great. Here, the principle of economy's sphere of application is demarcated as the space extending between the relative boundaries of the Church, defined by Canon Law, and its absolute boundaries, beyond which lie only heretics. The second moment is the letters of Cyril of Alexandria, who discusses economy as a means to a higher end, which is practiced when circumstances prove that the gain from acting economically is greater than following Canonic rules. The third pivotal moment appears in Eulogius. In the summary of his treatise dedicated to the principle of economy (found in Photius' Bibliotheca), Eulogius introduces and classifies further regulations for the various applications of that principle, accompanying each category with its own \"manual.\"\n\nI will start from the statement that the preoccupation for economics (i.e. macroeconomics) is less treated in the Church Fathers’ thinking in comparison with other dogmatic, spiritual, ascetical or moral issues. In almost all their homilies and moral writings, they indirectly insist instead on the individual economics (as presumptive forefathers of the nowadays microeconomics) of every person, family and local Church. The aims of their inducements were to aid the poor and to realise a perfect communion of all people in one Church – one that should be an epitome of the “future communion” they always talked about. In this article, I will try to investigate the understanding of economics, its role and its implications in the life of the person, the family and the Church according to the thought of the Church Fathers. How should be the attitude of people regarding both the money and the material goods in the relation with their fellows? In treating this issue, I will circumscribe the patristic field to some of the significant Eastern Church Fathers, namely St John Chrysostom, St Basil the Great and St Clement of Alexandria. At the same time, I also struggle to take into account several conceptions of some of the important modern historians and economists.\n\nOne of the most debated issues today in the social sciences is the relationship between ethics and economics. Martin de Azpilcueta&#39;s (1492-1586) writings on morality hold a distinguished place in the theological literature of the early modern era because he addressed many of the fundamental moral issues surrounding the birth of market economics. This article evaluates the reception of Scholastic political economy in the history of economic thought and presents a detailed exposition of Azpilcueta&#39;s moral teaching on the commercial and financial practices of his day. The article concludes with a description of Azpilcueta&#39;s understanding of the intrinsic relationship between morality and economics, which, for him, was neither a mere juxtaposition nor an opposition of disciplines."
