        "text": "This article tells the story of the first international topological conference in Moscow (1935), an outstanding event that, for the first time, brought together the most notable American, European, and Soviet mathematicians, including those who would later play decisive roles in the mathematization of economics: John von Neumann, Leonid Kantorovich, and Albert W. Tucker. The fact that Kantorovich was in contact with von Neumann and his closest colleagues, Solomon Lefschetz and Garrett Birkhoff, is hardly appreciated in the histories of mathematics and mathematical economics. Their brief academic exchange was interrupted by the increasing international isolation of Soviet mathematics and by the wars that ensued. The article provides a historical account of the conference and traces the intellectual and personal affinities of Soviet and non-Soviet mathematicians, as well as their conceptual innovations. It argues that the conference, as a singular event linking several research communities, mattered for the development of various formal frameworks and their dissemination, contributing to the intellectual landscape in which postwar mathematical economics could emerge. The article calls for a deeper analysis of conceptual affinities and motivations in applying mathematics to economics and for a more nuanced narrative linking these motivations to social and political contexts of economic modeling.\n\nThis paper examines critically the contributions of Cournot, Jevons and Walras as the founders of classical mathematical economics from a methodological standpoint. Advances in different economic schools and doctrines in the 19th century produced an environment of multi-dimensionality in economic analysis which was regarded by the pioneers of classical mathematical economists as a chaotic state. We have demonstrated that the formation of this new discipline, known equivalently as pure or scientific economics, was a response to this so-called chaotic state. We have also shown that the erroneous logic of abstraction in the sense of reducing a multi-dimensional economic system to a one-dimensional mechanical framework as the methodological basis of classical mathematical economics has been the origin of serious shortcomings in mathematical treatment of economics. Based on the writings of Jevons and Walras we have provided evidences to support the claim that advances in Marxian economic...\n\nThis paper delineates the main features of the Soviet mathematical economics by looking at its epistemic cultures and comparing it with the postwar American economics. Many general tendencies characteristic for the Western story were reproduced on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain. In particular, both disciplines were increasingly mathematized, had a contested status within the political landscape in general and economics profession in particular, and were in part institutionally defined by the anti-Semitism in the academia (1950s in the USA, 1970s in the USSR). We further distinguish between the two groups of the Soviet mathematical economists: one more attached to the ’economic cybernetics’ movement, preoccupied with the optimization techniques, dealing mainly with the production sector and eventually hoping to improve centralized planning; and another group that was more comfortable with game theory and more open to standard mainstream vision of the economy. We further define more closely the institutional sites and disciplinary identities of the two subcultures and provide tentative answers to the question why, despite the excellent technical training and various overlaps with the comparable American case, Soviet mathematical economists failed to develop a sucessful and internationally competitive research programme.\n\nThe role of mathematics in economic analysis is not yet a settled question. Smith, Ricardo, Mill and other eminent classical economists did not use mathematics in their economic theorizations. We have defined classical mathematical economics as the whole body of literature in mathematical treatment of economics originating mainly from the contributions of Cournot, Jevons and Walras. There are a number of different explanations for the origin of classical mathematical economics suggested by different authors, which may also explain the lack of general interests among classical economists in using mathematical methods in economic analysis. This paper attempts to examine critically the views put forward by Debreu, Cournot, Walras and von Neumann and Morgenstern on the origin of mathematics in economics. Using historical evidences through direct references to their original works, we have demonstrated that none of their views are convincing. It is also shown that the tradition of classical mathematical economics did not have any significant impact on the process of economic theorization within the framework of classical economics.\n\nWhat are the effects of authoritarian regimes on scholarly research in economics? And how might economic theory survive ideological pressures? The article addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of economics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science. Mathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many ideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These same ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by Soviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the economic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by exploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and probability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual exchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling apparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment absent under the Soviet rule.\n\nThe work of K.`Vela' Velupillai has illuminated the debate on the mathematization of economics by providing a broader view of the universe of mathematics and its possible applications in economics. The theoretical and policy consequences from the peculiar mode of mathematization in economics is another important theme in Vela work. Alternative modes of mathematization are o®ered with a call for an \\Algorithmic Economics\" in the future."
