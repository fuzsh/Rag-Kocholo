Kenneth Arrow was an American economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1972. He made seminal contributions to social choice theory with Arrow's impossibility theorem, which demonstrated that no ranked voting system can perfectly satisfy fairness and rationality criteria. He also developed foundational work in general equilibrium theory and other areas of economics. Arrow held professorships at Stanford and Harvard and influenced many students who went on to win the Nobel Prize as well, cementing his status as one of the most influential economists of the 20th century.",
