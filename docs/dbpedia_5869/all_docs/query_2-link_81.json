        "text": "The national saving rate declined in many industrial countries in the 1980s, and, in particular, the national saving rate in the United States dropped markedly, with both the public and private components exhibiting declines.1 This paper discusses reasons for the decline and reviews possible responses by policymakers. In a 1989 speech, the Managing Director of the Fund observed that “a strong argument could … be made for the Federal Government to run a significant surplus to offset the low level of private saving.”2 This paper develops an analytical basis for such an argument and makes some preliminary attempts at quantifying what magnitude of surplus might be desirable. The general approach and methodology that are taken could be applied more widely than in the U.S. context. To provide background for the policy issues analyzed later in the paper, the first two sections review the magnitude of the decline in savings rates relative to historical averages, address questions related to measurement, and discuss the factors underlying the recent decline in the national saving rate.\n\nThe next section examines whether there are reasons for seeking to reverse that decline by policy changes and concludes that there is a strong case for policy changes aimed at raising national saving. Moreover, to the extent that the factors behind the decline in private saving do not appear easy to reverse (and assuming an absence of Ricardian equivalence effects), increases in public saving may provide the most effective means of bolstering the national saving rate.3\n\nThe first principal strand of the argument is that the national saving rate is a variable that public policy should seek to influence. The second main strand is that changes in the federal fiscal balance may provide the most effective means for policy to influence the national saving rate. It would be quite possible, of course, to accept the first element of the argument—that public policy should seek to influence the national saving rate—while maintaining that structural measures directed at private saving provide the most effective tools for the task.\n\nPublic policy should only be concerned about the national saving rate if there are reasons for believing that the rate generated by market outcomes should be viewed as suboptimal or inappropriate. The approach taken here on this central issue is twofold. First, a variety of government policies may tend to diminish private saving below a pure market outcome. If it is either not desirable or not feasible to eliminate such impediments, a second-best alternative may be for the government to aim for a surplus in its own accounts to offset the induced loss of private saving. Second, it should be recalled that the fundamental welfare theorems yield a presumption that market outcomes are optimal only in the absence of market failures. In an economy characterized by the assumptions of the life-cycle model—there being a lack of effective intergenerational linking of preferences—there is a fundamental market failure in the sense that unborn economic agents are not represented in capital formation decisions. Consequently, there may be a role for policy intervention in an effort to offset this market failure. The nature and magnitude of such intervention of course involve difficult questions of intergenerational equity.\n\nFollowing the discussion of the rationale for policy intervention, two alternative frameworks aimed at quantifying an appropriate medium-term objective for the national saving rate are then presented. The first is based on an explicit optimality criterion—namely the neoclassical steady-state path on which per capita consumption is maximized, with a possible adjustment for a positive rate of social time preference. Illustrative calculations based on this framework indicate that a net national saving rate close to 10 percent of net national product (NNP) might be called for. While tax policy measures to boost private saving could play some role, the approach indicates that the associated target for the federal fiscal balance would nonetheless be a substantial surplus—perhaps in the neighborhood of 3 percent of NNP.\n\nThe second framework aims to calculate the net national saving rate and associated federal budget balance consistent with a target growth rate of output and assuming no reliance on foreign saving. On this basis, the calculations indicate that achievement of output growth consistent with the postwar average and the U.S. Administration’s medium-term economic projections might also require a net national saving rate close to 10 percent of NNP, and thus a substantial federal budget surplus.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe national saving rate declined in many industrial countries in the 1980s and this tendency toward decline has become a subject of discussion and analysis. In particular, the U.S. national saving rate dropped markedly in the 1980s reflecting declines in both the public and private components. Many of the factors that may be behind the decline in the U.S. private saving rate appear difficult to reverse in a major way through public policy. While carefully selected tax policies could play some role in boosting private saving, the magnitude of their likely contribution may be limited. An alternative strategy would be for the Federal Government to aim for the achievement of budgetary surpluses to offset reduced private saving. Such an approach would be justified by the fact that some part of the decline in private saving may reflect unintended consequences of public sector interventions into private market decisions—such as the provision of social security and various aspects of tax policy—and more fundamentally because private sector decisions may not adequately take account of the interests of future generations.\n\nTwo alternative frameworks aimed at quantifying medium-term objectives for the federal fiscal balance were then developed. Although used only in a U.S. context in the present paper, the approaches could be applied to other countries. The first framework was based on an explicit optimality criterion—namely finding the neoclassical steady-state path on which per capita consumption was maximized. Illustrative calculations indicated that the current U.S. national saving rate appeared to be well below the optimal level by this criterion and suggested that a net national saving rate of close to 10 percent of NNP might be called for. The associated target for the federal fiscal balance might be in the neighborhood of 3 percent of NNP surplus.\n\nThe second approach calculated the net national saving rate consistent with a target output growth rate, assuming no reliance on foreign saving (and a host of other assumptions). A key parameter in this framework is that related to multifactor productivity growth; one way to proceed is to assume that the latter rebounds in the projection period above its performance in the 1970s and 1980s, while remaining below the rapid growth rates of the 1950s and 1960s. On this basis, output growth of 3¼ percent annually—in line with average growth from 1950 to 1988—without reliance on foreign saving would require a net national saving rate of almost 10 percent of NNP and a federal budgetary surplus of close to 3 percent of NNP. If the target growth rate for output is reduced to 3 percent, then a federal surplus equivalent to 2 percent of NNP would still be indicated.\n\nThus two alternative frameworks of calculation yield the result that a net national saving rate equivalent to 10 percent of NNP and a federal budgetary surplus in the neighborhood of 3 percent of NNP may provide appropriate medium-term objectives. The precise numerical results of course depend on the specific frameworks presented and the assumptions that are made. In particular, if tax policy measures could boost private saving, the needed fiscal adjustment would be correspondingly reduced, though it would remain very substantive. In sum, a strong case exists for a large federal budget surplus to be an objective of U.S. fiscal policy.\n\nANNEX\n\nModified Golden Rule Calculations\n\nSimple Heuristics of the Golden Rule59\n\nAssume a one-sector closed economy in a steady-state growth path, with a population growth rate of n and an exogenous technological progress rate of g. The steady-state growth rate of the system is n + g. The net rate of return on capital is r. Compare this steady state to one with slightly more capital. The gain in output is given by r ΔK compared with the previous steady state. However, in this second steady state additional output must be devoted to investment to keep the (larger) capital stock growing at the steady-state growth rate. The additional investment requirement is given by (n + g)ΔK.\n\nIf in the initial steady state r exceeds n + g, then a shift to a more capital-intensive steady state raises consumption possibilities since the output gain exceeds what needs to be reinvested. If in the initial steady state r is less than n + g, then additional investment yields an output gain that is less than the amount needed for reinvestment and consumption possibilities are lowered. However, in this situation, a shift to a less capital-intensive steady state releases resources for consumption equal to n + g which exceed the output loss from lower capital intensity of r ΔK. Consequently, the steady-state path on which consumption possibilities (defined as per capita consumption with no allowance for time preference) is that on which the net rate of return on capital equals the sum of the growth rates of population and technological progress. That is,\n\nr=n+g.⁢(A1)\n\nWhen a pure time preference rate of p is incorporated into the structure, the steady-state growth path along which consumption possibilities are maximized (adjusted for time preference) satisfies a modified golden rule condition, namely that\n\nr−p=n+g.⁢(A2)\n\nSome Simple Algebra Behind the Calculations in the Text\n\nThe economy is assumed to be one-sector, closed, and characterized by a Cobb-Douglas production function:\n\nY=AKαL1−α,⁢(A3)\n\nwhere\n\nY = gross output\n\nK = gross capital stock\n\nL = the labor force.\n\nThen the marginal product of capital is given by\n\nR=αY/K⁢(A4)\n\nand equals the sum of the net rate of return on capital r and the rate of depreciation d. That is,\n\nr+d=αY/K.⁢(A5)\n\nFrom equation (A2), at the modified golden rule position, r is given by the sum of g, p, and n. Consequently, the capital-output ratio consistent with the modified golden rule is\n\nK/Y=α/(d+p+g+n).⁢(A6)\n\nNow since the increase in capital equals gross saving less depreciation, we can say\n\nΔK=S−dK,⁢(A7)\n\nwhich on rearrangement leads to\n\nS/Y=(ΔKK+d)KY.⁢(A8)\n\nIn the steady state, capital grows by n + g, and thus\n\nS/Y=(n+g+d)KY.⁢(A9)\n\nEquations (A6) and (A9) permit the gross saving rate in a modified golden rule path to be calculated. The net saving rate is given by the identity:\n\nNSNY=S−dKY−dK,(A10)\n\nwhere NS is net saving and NY is net output."
