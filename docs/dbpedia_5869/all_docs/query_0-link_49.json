        "meta_description": "‘Professional economists, students of doctrine and graduate students will welcome this valuable collection of articles on the legacy of the founder of general equilibrium economics, Léon Walras, who, perhaps more than any other person, legitimized economics as a science. Walker’s introduction is superb!’\r– Robert Mundell, Columbia University, US\r\r‘Professor Donald Walker displays an impressive extensive knowledge of the work of Léon Walras. In this book he exemplifies the essential complement that the history of economic thought brings to the mathematical research on General Equilibrium that was done in the past half-century.’\r– Gérard Debreu, University of California, Berkeley, US and European University Institute, Italy  \r\rThis important two-volume collection of over sixty published articles presents a major study of Léon Walras’s intellectual legacy and reveals how Walras’s ideas contributed significantly to the formation of the mainstream of modern microeconomic theory.  \r\rThe collection comprises two groups of writings. The first, consisting of interpretations of his ideas, discuss his contributions to the theory of general equilibrium, including his special models of capital and of money, his applications of theory to the formation of economic policies, and his use of it in connection with his concepts of economic justice and an ideal economy. The second group shows current uses of Walras’s ideas, including models dealing with Walrasian equilibrium, Walras’s law, Cournot-Walras models, Walrasian ideas in the context of game-theoretic analysis, the Walras correspondence, and WALRAS, an econometric model of the general equilibrium effects of agricultural policies.",
