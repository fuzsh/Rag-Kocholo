We kicked off 2023 with getting tagged in by Nathan Love to animation direct the anime-style sequence in the video for SZA’s out-of-control hit, Kill Bill. It was a huge honor to work on this piece — the song itself ended up destroying records on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart for the most weeks at No. 1 by a lead female artist, while the album, SOS, became the longest reigning No. 1 album by a woman.

Pulling inspiration from both Katsuji Morishita’s animated sequence from the original Kill Bill (2003) movie and Shinichirō Watanabe’s Samurai Champloo (2004-2005), we brought her story of revenge to life. Special thanks to Joe Burrascano for production, Sam Feske for amazing comp work (and cherry blossom-petals), and Nolan J. Downs for being our stellar assistant animator. To top it all off, we were observing dry January… we literally “did all of this sober”.

The video was nominated for not one but four VMAs: Video of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Direction (Christian Breslauer) and Best Editing (Luis Caraza Peimbert)!
