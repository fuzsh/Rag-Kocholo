Looks like Demi Lovato had some time to kill before her Pepsi Center show with Nick Jonas while she was in Denver.

“I really want to be a singer one day. I have actually been traveling the country with my ex-boyfriend’s brother,” she told one passenger when she asked what she does besides drive Lyft.

She later put two and two together.

The dressed down pop superstar threw on a hat and big aviators to pick people up around Denver neighborhoods, and it was all recorded for “Undercover Lyft.”

She picked up a few chatty girls and threaded the needle a bit, asking questions like “What kind of music do you listen to?” and one passenger even revealed she was a Jonas Brothers “fan girl.” Lovato was able to get her to duet a song from the movie she made with the brothers, “Camp Rock.”

“My friends would seriously make so much fun of me,” the passenger said. “Well luckily no one’s going to see this,” Lovato replied.

Well. Turns out she was indeed not dueting with not a random Lyft driver but the ex-girlfriend of the boy she admitted to crushing on in 8th grade, Joe Jonas.

Lovato reveals herself to each passenger when she drops them off, see their reactions in the video above.
