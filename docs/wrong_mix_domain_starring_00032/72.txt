They got engaged in October.

And on Saturday, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas hosted their official engagement party at the Mamo restaurant in Manhattan, New York.

The Games Of Thrones actress, 21, looked all smiles as she held her fiance's arm while walking into their event.

Sophie stepped out in black trousers teamed with a silky white blouse.

The British actress added height to her already 5ft9in frame with black platform shoes.

She wore her fiery hair in loose waves, while keeping her skin glowing with gold eye-shadow and highlighter.

Her husband-to-be sported a matching ensemble with a patterned black-and-white suit.

Joe's famous brother and former Jonas Brothers band-mate Kevin Jonas stepped out for her little brother's engagement party accompanied by his wife Danielle.

Also at the event were Joe's DNCE band-mates, who seemed to have bought the happy couple a few engagement presents.

Sophie and Joe invited only their close family and friends, as they hosted their memorable night at the French restaurant.

The couple declared their proposal on October 15, as the two posted the same picture on their social media pages.

The news fired up a major social media storm with both their posts receiving over 1 million likes - and huge congratulations commented from Instagram users.

The singer captioned the post: 'She said yes,' while Sophie's stated: 'I said yes.'

Joe swept Sophie off her feet after they had only been dating for nearly a year.

Prior to the engagement the couple had kept their relationship low-key, never posting images of each other.
