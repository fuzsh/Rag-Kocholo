        "text": "This is an ever-evolving work-in-progress — last updated: July 20th, 2024.\n\nEvery blue title is a link to the movie’s IMDb page — the industry-standard Internet Movie Database.\n\nIf this makes just one person see one great movie, it’ll be worth it.\n\nIf you want you can click on any of these section titles and it will jump you right to the start of that particular list. 😉\n\n.\n\n1. The Number-of-Times Watched Metric\n\n2. Comedies\n\n3. Dramas\n\n4. Biopics (non music)\n\n5. Documentaries (non music)\n\n6. Movies About Making Movies\n\n7. Movies about Politics\n\n8.

By Auteur\n\n14. 300 More Movies “On Deck” for Inclusion\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nThe Number-of-Times Watched Metric\n\nFour or More Viewings and Honest Assessments\n\nThe concept here is not what a person would necessarily think are “the greatest movies ever made” but rather a list of the movies actually watched all the way thru a minimum of four times — which I later expanded the parameter to include three times.\n\nSeeing a movie twice is very different than seeing it three or four or more times. We all see lots of movies once, then maybe a second time to see if we “got it” or maybe passively with a friend — but it’s when you intentionally watch a movie for a third and especially a fourth time that the film crosses a line into a special category.\n\nSome say there’s no point in watching a movie twice. Or they’re too busy. To that I say — can you only look at a great painting once? Or listen to a great song or read a great book only once?\n\nThe only reason movies make this list is based on the number times watched — not whether I want to say I liked it or not, or recommend it, or think it’s one of the great films of all time. Those are different lists — for critics and academics and film institutes and such.\n\nThis is an Actually Watched List. And it’s a game you can play as you fill in your own puzzle — make your own movie of your life’s movies. What you’ve watched, not what you should have watched, or fib or pretend that you’ve watched, or wished you’d watched more than once. I wouldn’t put “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” on a Greatest Films list, or even want to admit I’ve watched it three times — but I know I have. And that’s part of the discovery of going down this path.\n\nYou must have physically — and joyously (theoretically) — sat thru the entire movie, not just done it in your head, and not just watched it once then seen snippets a few times.\n\nIf you can’t remember the movie in great detail, you probably didn’t see it 3 or 4 or more times. You should be able to recount the plot, the arc, lots of key scenes, the actors, and parts of the dialog in detail. The movie should give you chills or goosebumps, or make you laugh yourself silly, or cry at some point — and in the best cases, several of the above.\n\nDo Not list movies you’ve only seen twice! It’s very tempting to embellish your memory. You have to really think about it to confirm you’ve actually seen the whole thing 3 (or 4) times.\n\nYou could have seen a movie once or twice and it really stuck with you, but those don’t count. To update the Jacqueline Susann novel / Kirk Douglas movie — Twice Is Not Enough.\n\nAlso — it really doesn’t count if you started to watch it a second time but then didn’t see it all the way thru! — we’ve all got lots of those!\n\nAlso — it doesn’t count if you just want to see the movie a third time. If you’d like, you can start a “seen twice and wanna see again” list for those movies — as I’ve done at the end of this page.\n\nAlso — don’t worry that some movies make it on the list only because your all-movie cable network happened to be playing them in heavy rotation for months. I would never have seen the great Cage & Travolta performances in “Face/Off” if it wasn’t on some movie network when I was homebound for a spell.\n\nYou might catch a few minutes flippin the channels one day, and go, “Hmm, this is actually pretty good.” Then you make a point to watch it from the beginning, and then it’s so good, you watch it again. And then once you get the rhythms of it, the different subtexts, and subliminal themes, and subtleties of performances, you can really enjoy watching it a third time as an insider playing in the orchestra and riding the score, hitting the cymbal-crashing peaks, and rising to the top with the solos while simultaneously keeping the backbeat with the supporting melody-players. Do you want to hear Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” only once in your life? There are those great rare moments in art where it all comes together. Nobody’s ever even heard of his “1811 Overture” because it probably sucked.\n\nAnd films are even harder to create than a symphony. There are so many variables that all have to come together, including the weather — see Lost In La Mancha or Heart of Darkness, A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse, or meddling producers — see Hollywood Ending.\n\nYou remember the first time you saw a movie — the discovery, the unfolding, the first impressions.\n\nAnd you know if you saw it a second time — when you knew what was happening and what was coming.\n\nBut once you watch a movie for a third time, it crosses over into a special realm. You, by choice, relish in it, dance with it, become friends with it. Or maybe you realize you’ve now seen it enough — but it’s still in that exclusive club of multi-hour rides you’ve chosen to take more than twice.\n\nAnd you know you’ve seen a movie four times or more because you’ve almost memorized it, played right along with it, became one with it. This is what we’re talkin’ about. 😉\n\nThen there’s the Watched-A-Ridiculous-Amount-of-Times List. These are the movies that have really become a part of you.\n\nAlso — Screen Size Does Matter. I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: “You can’t really say you’ve seen a movie unless you’ve seen it on the big screen. That’s what they’re made for.” And I still stand by that. But for me — and most people — usually the repeat viewings occur on a TV at home. And that’s okay.\n\nAlso — there are lots of great movies not on this list cuz I didn’t like them enough to watch them more than twice — and there’s lots I just haven’t seen four times but I want to — say, Dr. Strangelove, Spellbound or Touch of Evil.\n\nAlso — older movies obviously have an advantage since they’ve been able to play over and over again on TV or wherever for so much of your lifetime. Or you’ve actually got them on VHS, DVD or Blu-ray.\n\nA few movies will also make anyone’s list because they were an old girlfriend or boyfriend’s favorite. That’s okay, too. If you’ve seen it 4 times, you’ve seen it 4 times.\n\nThe most important thing is to be honest in putting movies on the list and not editing the truth. It makes a more interesting, fun and accurate picture. 😉\n\nIt’s useful to make this list for yourself as you’ll discover directors you didn’t know you liked so much — then you can check out or reconsider their other films.\n\nIf I were to teach a film course, these movies would be the curriculum.\n\nOr are recommended movies for friends to see. If everyone shared their lists, you’d have a great source of movies to see for when you can’t think of one.\n\nIt should also have the “Oh, Yeah!” factor — when somebody reads down the list they suddenly remember a movie they always wanted to see, or saw once and always wanted to see again.\n\nThe idea is — every one of these movies has to be great or I wouldn’t have watched it three or four times. If you had passed on the movie for some reason, my hope is that you’ll reconsider.\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nBrian’s Top 50 Movies — Watched-A-Ridiculous-Number-of-Times\n\nThe Maltese Falcon — 1941\n\nThe Treasure of The Sierra Madre — 1948\n\nBeat The Devil — 1953\n\nRear Window — 1954\n\nRebel Without a Cause — 1955\n\nN.Y., N.Y. — 1957\n\nCat On A Hot Tin Roof — 1958\n\nPull My Daisy — 1959\n\nIt’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World — 1963\n\nA Hard Day’s Night — 1964\n\nDon’t Look Back — 1967\n\nIn The Heat Of The Night — 1967\n\nButch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid — 1969\n\nWoodstock — 1970\n\nJesus Christ Superstar — 1973\n\nPaper Moon — 1973\n\nThe Sting — 1973\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest — 1975\n\nAll The President’s Men — 1976\n\nStar Wars — 1977\n\nThe Last Waltz — 1978\n\nBeing There — 1979\n\nThe Shining — 1980\n\n‘Round Midnight — 1986\n\nGoodfellas — 1990\n\nMy Cousin Vinny — 1992\n\nThe Player — 1992\n\nGroundhog Day — 1993\n\nTrue Romance — 1993\n\nForrest Gump — 1994\n\nFargo — 1996\n\nJackie Brown — 1997\n\nThe Last Time I Committed Suicide — 1997\n\nPrimary Colors — 1998\n\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley — 1999\n\nBest In Show — 2000\n\nLucky Numbers — 2000\n\nState & Main — 2000\n\nFestival Express — 2003\n\nMasked & Anonymous — 2003\n\nPhil The Alien — 2004\n\nInglourious Basterds — 2009\n\nThe Social Network — 2010\n\nMoneyball — 2011\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street — 2013\n\nThe Imitation Game — 2014\n\nKnives Out — 2019\n\nOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywood — 2019\n\nHamilton — 2020\n\nBabylon — 2022\n\nBarbie — 2023\n\nPlus — the TV exceptions —\n\nFawlty Towers\n\nThe Civil War series (PBS, Ken Burns)\n\nComedians In Cars Getting Coffee\n\n.\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nNote: Movies below that have a few sentences of a ‘review’ have, generally speaking, been seen since 2020 when this page/list really got formalized and structured.\n\n[format: Title — year; director; writer (when notable); some of the main actors; notes. (numbers of time seen. “(4)” means “4 or more.”)]\n\nComedies [118]\n\nre: Comedies vs. Dramas categories — all comedies have a dramatic structure, and most dramas have some comedic relief. When a film was a close call, I went with IMDb’s first categorization for it. A handful of movies are listed here in both categories.\n\nThe Gold Rush — 1925; written, directed by & starring Charlie Chaplin B&W (seen once) The Cocoanuts — 1929; Marx Brothers – Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo, and Margaret Dumont; Florida real estate. Based on the Brothers’ Broadway show. First-ever use of overhead shot of dance choreography. B&W (3)\n\nCity Lights — 1931; written, scored, produced, edited, directed by & starring Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin’s favorite of all his films; he developed it for 3 years. He kept it a silent picture had become the norm. He brought Albert Einstein to the L.A. premiere, and George Bernard Shaw to the London. The highest-grossing film of 1931 in the U.S. B&W (seen once)\n\nDuck Soup — 1933; Leo McCarey; Marx Brothers – Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo, and Margaret Dumont — Freedonia! B&W (4)\n\nThe Thin Man — 1934; W.S. Van Dyke; written by Dashiell Hammett; William Powell & Myrna Loy; early classic climax scene with all suspects assembled in same room to reveal the murderer. B&W (3)\n\nModern Times — 1936; produced, written, edited, scored and directed by & starring Charlie Chaplin; Paulette Goddard. The final major American film to use silent conventions like title cards – and Chaplin performing in pantomime. The last title card ever to appear (thus the end of the silent era) was the Little Tramp saying “Buck up – never say die. We’ll get along!” Although, Chaplin’s voice is heard on film for the first time — singing a nonsense lyric song in faux Italian. Contains the assembly line scene that clearly spawned Lucy’s classic bit. Great choreography and physical comedy by Chaplin. Fred Astaire must’ve loved this guy. Sort of – Orwell’s 1984 on film. This could almost be listed under “Trippy Movies” … but those sorta need to be in color. 🙂 B&W (seen once)\n\nArsenic and Old Lace — 1944; Frank Capra; Cary Grant, Raymond Massey, Peter Lorre B&W (3)\n\nAbbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein — 1948; Charles Barton; Bud Abbott & Lou Costello, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney; Tarantino cited this as an influence on how to blend genres; Jerry Garcia’s favorite movie and inspired his lifelong involvement with film. It was his first sense of the bizarre and that there were weird things in this world. You can sure see where Mel Brooks took his Young Frankenstein cues from. Funny script, and Lou at some of his best. I laughed out loud a few times watching it in 2021. Comically campy ’40s acting with comically low-budget sets. B&W (3)\n\nHere’s a great clip of Garcia reflecting on it —\n\nHarvey — 1950; Henry Koster; Jimmy Stewart’s classic twisted comedy. I actually saw it on the stage in London in the early ’70s with Jimmy Stewart – and he got a standing ovation. 🙂 B&W (seen twice)\n\nBeat The Devil — 1953; John Huston; screenplay credit to Truman Capote, but he bailed in the middle of the madness and Huston, Bogie, Lorie & others made it up on the fly after that; Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones, Robert Morley. I can’t believe these guys (Houston, Bogart, Jones) weren’t comedic actors & director. This is SO funny – if you look at it right. Morley is Brilliant. And the dialog is brilliant. I would love to have this script. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. There’s also so many plot changes. Great characterizations. Jennifer Jones out-Marilyn’s Monroe in 1953, playing the most wonderfully dreamy and deluded blond. The Talented Mr. Ripley is a kind of later version (although that’s really not a comedy). B&W (4)Limelight — 1953; written, directed by & starring Charlie Chaplin – plus he wrote all the music and won the Best Oscar for it; Claire Bloom as the muse, Nigel Bruce, Buster Keaton, Norman Lloyd, and Chaplin’s son Sydney; Chaplin’s last American-made movie. Really good. About the hope and love and art and the meaning of life. Also about an aging clown facing the end of his career. B&W (seen once)\n\nSome Like It Hot — 1959; written & directed by Billy Wilder; Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon. B&W (3)\n\nIt’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World — 1963; Stanley Kramer; Buddy Hackett & Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman & Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters (his first movie), Sid Caesar, Spencer Tracy (his 2nd last movie), Terry-Thomas, Phil Silvers, Dick Shawn — and cameos or small parts by Jimmy Durante (his last film), Don Knotts, Carl Reiner, Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, “Rochester”, Buster Keaton, Peter Falk, Jim Backus, Norman Fell, William Demarest, Charles Lane, Andy Devine, ZaSu Pitts, the Three Stooges! The all-star cameo-rich casting was first pioneered by 1956’s Around The World In 80 Days. It was filmed for Cinerama — those extra-wide, curved screens. It was the first film ever shown at the legendary Cinerama Dome in LA. The original Cinerama version ran 202 minutes. The version most of us saw in regular theaters was cut down to 163 minutes — fully 30 minutes less! The 3-disc Criterion Collection edition has both versions, the original painstakingly restored frame by frame from uncovered footage. (4)\n\nThe Comedy of Terrors — 1963; Jacques Tourneur; Vincent Price (great), Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone. Bizarre funny black comedy parody of the horror genre; very much like Young Frankenstein, or Beat The Devil. Soundtrack funny, too. (1)\n\nThe Pink Panther — 1963; written & directed by Blake Edwards; Peter Sellers, David Niven, a young Robert Wagner, and two Sophia Loren-like beauties Claudia Cardinale and Capucine; and GREAT music by Henry Mancini. (3)\n\nSunday In New York — 1963; Peter Tewksbury; Norman Krasna first wrote the Broadway play then the screenplay, and boy is it fantastic writing; Jane Fonda & Cliff Robertson as brother & sister, Rod Taylor as the love interest, Robert Culp, Mia Farrow, Jim Backus; great jazzy swing music by Peter Nero who has a great cameo leading the band in the nightclub (sounds like the Johnny Carson theme-song); great filmmaking; tons of Manhattan / Central Park location shooting circa 1963 including a great New York apartment as the main set; how NYC looked just before the ’64 World’s Fair Kesey & the Bus went to – and local buses play a big role in the movie; funny great movie and terrific warm positive love story. (seen once)The Ghost and Mr. Chicken — 1966; Alan Rafkin; Don Knotts!! Dick Sargent. Great comedy and performance by Don Knotts. Classic supporting cast of ’60s staples — looks like it could be a Bewitched or Andy Griffith episode. Don’t know any of their names — but recognize every one of their faces. Great haunted house sets. (4)\n\nCasino Royale — 1967; SIX different directors! Peter Sellers, David Niven, Ursula Andress, Woody Allen, Orson Welles (+ co-director), John Huston (+ co-director), William Holden, Charles Boyer, George Raft, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Deborah Kerr, Jacqueline Bisset (but her one scene voice is looped by someone else), and “a Bondwagon of the most beautiful girls you ever saw” as the movie poster correctly claimed. James Bond spoof. Incredible cast — but a total mess of a production & film. Too many cooks – who were apparently cooked. Strife-&-ego-riddled and out-of-control. Sellers was such an egomaniacal diva, he called in saying he didn’t feel like working one day, so the producer just fired him and they had to make do with whatever they’d already shot. Apparently Orson Welles just hated Sellers, and for their long scene together at the Baccarat table they had to be shot with only one of them in the room at a time. The film has rightly been compared to Cleopatra — it almost bankrupt 20th Century Fox. Woody was so repulsed by the whole thing, he left mid-movie and they had to write him out of scenes. Surreal & psychedelic, especially the production design. Kind of a blend of Help, Dr. Strangelove, Sleeper, Head and Blazing Saddles, except not a lot of laughs. (for me, 3 times in 2 hours) Pretty much a scrambled disconnected mess of a movie. Maybe this would work on acid, but I didn’t try it, and doubt it. Despite universally bad reviews, the pull of James Bond, the star-studded cast and the naked psychedelic girl on the poster it ended up the 13th highest-grossing film of the year! (seen once)\n\nThe Odd Couple — 1968; Gene Saks; Neil Simon; Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon, John Fielder (4)\n\nThe Party — 1968; screenplay & directed by Blake Edwards; Peter Sellers, The Love Boat’s Gavin MacLeod in a small role, and classic ’60s/’70s Tonight Show / Johnny Carson blond Carol Wayne, and TV staple Steve Franken as the drunken waiter; Henri Mancini music. The Pink Panther director, star & composer reunited for this crazy ’60s party movie. Sellars, playing an Indian actor, has very few lines. It’s a Chaplinesque masterclass in physical comedy. Filmed in Los Angeles in the summer of 1967 – so it’s prime time psychedelic ’60s, including a closet full of pot-smoking musicians. Fantastic futuristic high-tech “sixties” home built as a set. Largely improvised from a 50-page outline and filmed in sequence. (seen twice)\n\nM*A*S*H — 1970; Robert Altman; Ring Lardner Jr. screenplay (who hated all the improvisations and changes Altman made on the fly … and then happily accepted for the win for Best Screenplay Oscar); Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duval, Sally Kellerman; and all in their first movies — Bud Cort, Gary Burghoff, Fred Williamson, John Schuck & Rene Auberjonois (who’s got more IMDb credits than anyone else in the movie!). Renegade under-the-studio-radar filmmaking at its best. Much of the cast came from a San Fransisco theater troupe. Made on a shoestring $3.5 million budget – and came in under. 14 of the 30 speaking roles in the movie were by actors making their feature film debuts. They had a surgeon on set all shoot to make sure the operating rooms were accurate. Deservedly highly-praised breakthrough movie for Altman. Brilliant use of da Vinci’s Last Supper. The lyrics to the Suicide is Painless song were written by Altman’s 14 year old son. Altman said he got paid $70,000 for making the movie, and his son earned more than $1 million for co-writing the song. 🙂 (4)\n\nThe Out-of-Towners — 1970; Arthur Hill; Neil Simon wrote it; Jack Lemmon & Sandy Dennis (3)\n\nHarold and Maude — 1971; Hal Ashby‘s must-see masterpiece; Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, music by Cat Stevens (4)\n\nSleeper — 1973; written & directed by Woody Allen; Woody, Diane Keaton (3)\n\nBlazing Saddles — 1974; cowriter (along with Richard Pryor), director, star & songwriter Mel Brooks; Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Slim Pickens, Harvey Korman, Burton Gilliam, John Hillerman, Don DeLuise, and Madeline Kahn (nominated for Best Supporting Oscar). Also nominated for Best Editing and a Mel Brooks’ song! Strange Count Basie cameo in the desert. I don’t like humor based around racism or hearing white people say the N word over and over. Plus it’s a Western. This was absolutely unwatchable for me. Other than Young Frankenstein, I’ve never found a Mel Brooks movie funny. (seen once)\n\nYoung Frankenstein — 1974; Mel Brooks; screenwriters Mel Brooks & Gene Wilder; Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Terri Garr, Cloris Leachman, Peter Boyle B&W (4)\n\nPhantom of the Paradise — 1974; written & directed by Brian De Palma; Paul Williams, William Finley, Jessica Harper (3)\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail — 1975; Terry Gilliam; written by all of Monty Python; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Connie Booth, Carol Cleveland, Neil Innis (4)\n\nThe Sunshine Boys — 1975; dir. Herbert Ross; funny Oscar-nominated screenplay by Neil Simon based his Broadway play; Walter Matthau & George Burns (his first film in 36 years, won Best Actor Oscar), Richard Benjamin, and Howard Hesseman & F. Murray Abraham in bit parts; best scenes are the two Sunshine Boys in Willy’s (Matthau’s) apt. where they rehearse and reminisce; brilliant portrayal of aging entertainers and lifelong friends; love the city vs. the country combative theme. Somehow this movie always makes me feel good … about friends and life. color (with B&W opening) (4)\n\nSilver Streak — 1976; Arthur Hiller; Gene Wilder, Richard Pryor, Jill Clayburgh, Patrick McGoohan, the always great Ned Beatty, Clifton James, Ray Walston, Scatman Crothers, Richard Kiel (the giant), Fred Willard. Henry Mancini’s music. A mystery comedy adventure thriller set on a train. The first of four pairings between Pryor & Wilder (Stir Crazy, See No Evil Hear No Evil, and Another You). Set on an Amtrak, but the company feared bad publicity so it had to be filmed on the CPR in Canada. Some good cinematography and editing, but a so-so comedy. Script holes and cliches as a thriller. I’d long heard good things about this and wanted to see, but can’t really recommend it. Makes me want to watch The Sting (also with Ray Walston) again — an infinitely better version of a similar idea.

A powerful, poignant, brilliant, surreal, silly, equal-opportunity offender. This and Holy Grail were the peak of Python creations. Great score, sound editing, production design, and location shooting in Tunisia. And Graham Chapman in the lead right after he got sober. The Guardian, Channel 4 and Total Film have all raked it as the top comedy of all time.

Smart, interesting movie. A funny mockumentary blending Woody into historic photographs & footage a la Forrest Gump ten years later. Woody got New Yorker literati to appear talking about the fictional celebrity. The footage of F. Scott Fitzgerald is only few seconds known to exist. They have historic footage of the same block of Washington Square North (where I lived for 6 years) as Zelig’s Greenwich Village flat. Just as “Rashomon” has become a noun meaning different points of view, “Zelig” is now used to refer to someone who is chameleon-like in any situation, and/or someone who knows everyone or has been everywhere. both B&W & color (seen twice)\n\nGhostbusters — 1984; Ivan Reitman; written by Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis; Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis (4)\n\nClue — 1985; co-written & directed by Jonathan Lynn; story & exec produced by John Landis; Eileen Brennon, Tim Curry (who calls this his favorite of all his movies), Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren and Howard Hesseman (“Our lives are in danger you beatnik! 🙂 ) ; killer cast and a great script; based on the classic board game; set in 1954; exquisite production design; everything was an elaborate set except the mansion exterior and the ballroom; three different endings / whodunits, with different endings shown in different theaters, but the DVD has all three; was prompted to watch it again in 2022 after it was talked about it on the Knives Out commentary.

River and Keanu would go on to make My Own Private Idaho the next year. Kevin Kline & William Hurt were reunited for the first time since The Big Chill. Funny uncredited cameo where Kevin Kline picks up his real-life wife Phoebe Cates in a bar. Fantastic script. The Kline character is kind of a Neal Cassady. I found this an absolutely hilarious movie — with a freakin BRILLIANT cast. Same as Lucky Numbers — funny, amazing script, cast, director, performances, premise inspired by a real story, and both about comically inept people committing crimes — and a movie hardly anybody ever mentions.

Movie where Pesci motions to Topmei’s, “There’s more.” (4)\n\nBob Roberts — 1992; written & directed by & starring Tim Robbins; plus Gore Vidal, Ray Wise (the guy from Twin Peaks & Good Night, And Good Luck); tons of cameos, including a very young Jack Black; Robbins wrote and performed his own songs, but would not let a soundtrack be released cuz he knew the crazy right would take the satirical songs and make them their anthem. Done in mock-documentary style. This could almost be on the Most Disturbing List, and is particularly scary post Iraq War II. (3)\n\nDazed and Confused — 1993; written, produced & directed by Richard Linklater; Matthew McConaughey (in his film debut, and the source of his legendary “Alright, alright, alright,” which was improvised), Ben Affleck (his first film role), Adam Goldberg, Rory Cochrane, Jason London, the always great Parker Posey, Joey Lauren Adams (film debut), Milla Jonovich, Marissa Ribisi (film debut; Giovanni’s twin sister), Wiley Wiggins. Although McConaughey plays a slightly older character, he’s actually younger than most of the cast. Takes place over 24 hours — May 28/29, 1976 — in Austin Texas, and filmed entirely on locations. I appreciated that this was not exploitive of women — that there weren’t gratuitous boobie shots like in most movies for and about teenagers. A couldn’t-be-better mid-’70s soundtrack. Boy, was this ever my life! The music, the hair, the clothes, the puka shells, the whole gang camaraderie, the euphoric graduation mayhem. One of Tarantino’s favorite films. Some movies I watch and I’m counting the minutes till they’re over; others I want to go on forever. This is the latter. 😉 This is a joyous movie there just aren’t enough of. “All I’m saying is that I wanna look back and say that I did the best I could while I was stuck in this place — had as much fun as I could while I was stuck in this place — played as hard as I could while I was stuck in this place.” (seen once)\n\nGroundhog Day — 1993; Harold Ramis; Ramis also cowrote screenplay; Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stanley Tobolowsky (4)\n\nSleepless in Seattle — 1993; written & directed by Nora Ephron; Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan (3)\n\nMrs. Doubtfire — 1993; Chris Columbus; Robin Williams, Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein (3)\n\nThe Hudsucker Proxy — 1994; written & directed by the Coen brothers; Tim Robbins, Paul Newman, Jennifer Jason Leigh — all brilliant performances. Plus Charles Durning, Peter Gallagher, John Mahoney, Bill Cobbs, Steve Buscemi (playing a Beatnik cafe owner), John Goodman (announcer). A masterpiece of a film. Really funny. Those Coen brothers are certainly visionaries and surrealists.

Really funny movie about temping that came out the same year as my book about temping The Temp Survival Guide, and the CBS comedy Temporarily Yours (see Made-For-TV Exceptions section).

You can read my review of it here. (4)\n\nHigh Fidelity — 2000; Stephen Frears; a very relatable fourth wall-inhabiting John Cusack (also co-screenwriter), the quintessential Jack Black role (who the director had no idea of until he turned up on set), beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones, a perfectly awkward Todd Louiso, a sultry Lisa Bonet, the always adorably quirky Joan Cusack, a goofily pompous Tim Robbins, Iben Hjejle, Joelle Carter, Lili Taylor, Sara Gilbert, and a Bruce Springsteen cameo. Brilliant script — reset from the London of the novel to Cusack’s home of Chicago — with perfect casting. Besides the killer soundtrack, incidental music by Howard Shore. Probably the second greatest music–comedy after Spinal Tap. It came from a novel, and also became both a short-lived Broadway musical and a one-season TV series on Hulu.

(3)\n\nHollywood Ending — 2002; written & directed by Woody Allen; Woody, Téa Leoni, Treat Williams, George Hamilton, Tiffani Thiessen, Debra Messing as a wonderful ditz, and Beat pal Peter Gerety as Woody’s shrink. Great script & filmmaking. A movie about Woody making a movie . . . and then he goes blind. Classic stuff. (4)\n\nShowtime — 2002; Tom Dey; Robert De Niro & Eddie Murphy, Rene Russo, Alex Borstein (3)\n\nLuck — 2003; Peter Wellington; Luke Kirby, Sarah Polley; Canadian movie about gambling at the Canada-Russia ’72 hockey summit. (3)\n\nPhil The Alien — 2004; written, directed by & starring Rob Stefaniuk; Jason Jones, Nicole de Boer, Sean Cullen, Graham Greene, Boyd Banks; funny-cool Canadian comedy about an alien landing in and infiltrating backwoods Canada. The concept, the Phil characterization, the script (especially the first 2 acts), the inexplicable casting, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the costuming, the location choices, the accurate portrayal of lake-country Canada … it’s fantastic! This is Monty Python-twisted, but SO Canadian. (4)\n\nThe Ladykillers — 2004; written & directed by the Coen Brothers (the first time they’re both credited as directors); Tom Hanks, early & crazy J.K. Simmens, Marlon Wayans, George Wallace, Stephen Root, and Irma P Hall, the old black woman in the most memorable role of her 100 credits. Incredible cinematography and art direction. Smart & effective American translation of a British comedy into an American one. Fantastic & funny movie. (4)\n\nThe Aristocrats — 2005; Paul Provenza (and Penn Jillette); featuring nearly every comedian you’ve ever heard of, but the key & funniest ones I remember are: Gilbert Gottfried, Bob Saget, Drew Carey, Sarah Silverman, Paul Reiser, George Carlin, Andy Dick, Martin Mull, Mario Cantone (as Liza Minelli), Kevin Pollak (as Christopher Walkin), Eric Meed the card trick guy, and South Park.

Great comedy about cops in England. I laughed out loud about 15 times. Part of the filmmakers comedy “Cornetto Trilogy.” Tons of great location shooting in small-town England. Everything about this film is brilliantly done. Story, script, casting, cinematography, editing, sound editing, locations. And it’s funny. Frequent use of Wright’s classic & signature crash zooms — fast zoom-ins, also employed by Darren Aronofsky & Tarantino. There’s a TON of homages and references to other movies. No wonder Tarantino, Peter Jackson, Rian Johnson & Kevin Smith are friends with this guy! Funny press tour documentary — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbJQa1M4LpM&ab_channel=LEKHANHProductions (4)\n\nTropic Thunder — 2008; written & directed by and starring Ben Stiller; Robert Downey Jr., Tom Cruise (who’s hysterically, historically funny in a small supporting role), Matthew McConaughey, Jack Black, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan. Funny movie! Would love to have seen it in a theater full of laughing people! Both the commentaries on the DVD are GREAT including Downey doing his in character from the movie. (4)\n\n21 Jump Street— 2012; Phil Lord & Christopher Miller; from an original story by Jonah Hill; Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Dave Franco, Brie Larson, Rob Riggle, Chris Parnell, Nick Offerman, Ellie Kemper, with a cameo by Johnny Depp (from the original series). Great cast, all playing deadpan comedy to the hilt. I’ve watched it twice, and it IS funny and well written. Great and funny drug trip sequence. (seen twice)\n\nTed — 2012; written, directed & voiced by Seth MacFarlane; Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Giovanni Ribisi, Patrick Warburton (3)\n\nThe Internship — 2013; Shawn Levy; original story and script co-writer and lead Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Aasif Mandvi, Rose Byrne, Max Minghella (in both the Google & Facebook movies!), Dylan O’Brien, B.J. Novak, Josh Brener, Josh Gad, with great cameos by Will Farrell, John Goodman, Rob Riggle & Gary Anthony Williams. Old guys interning at Google. Great premise, script and execution. Inspiring theme about being positive and following your dreams and about how oddballs are okay. Includes Harry Potter homage with the “quidditch” sport with brooms and balls thru hoops. Fantastic club party scene. Such echoes of my years at MTV. The director said on the (highly recommended) commentary that roughly 20% of the movie is ad-libbed improved. He also says no money exchanged hands between Google and the film company. Google Creative Labs made the end credits, which are one of the most innovated & unique in movie history. The director’s mantra for the movie: “Everybody’s searching for something.” (seen twice)\n\nThis Is The End — 2013; written & directed by Seth Rogan & Evan Goldberg; James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogan, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Emma Watson, Michael Cera, Rihanna, Channing Tatum and a TON of cameos. A feast of L.A. party people — with a heavy dose of Canadians. All-star surreal BizarroWorld end-of-the-world comedy. Insane shit . . . that was one of the biggest-grossing movies of 2013. Entirely set in L.A., but entirely filmed in New Orleans. James Franco’s house (where most of the action takes place) is a set built for the movie. The only film combo featuring the top three “stoner” actors all riffing off each other — Cheech & Chong + 1 — James Franco, Seth Rogan (who co-wrote & co-directed) & Jonah Hill. Then add to that, Danny McBride who the cast all said was the funniest guy on set. Then put it all on top of a kind-of Orwellian / H.G. Wells script. (seen twice)\n\nA Million Ways To Die In The West — 2014; written & directed by Seth MacFarlane; with Seth, Charlize Theron, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Neil Patrick Harris (seen twice)\n\nSpy — 2015; produced, written & directed by Paul Feig; Melissa McCarthy (who, I can’t think of a funnier comedic actress in 2021), Jude Law, action film staple Jason Statham, Allison Janney, Bobby Cannavale, Rose Byrne. Funny comedy – brilliant comedic spoof on James Bond / action movies. This is the best script I’ve seen manifested in quite a while. Great filmmaking: perfect casting, rock n roll editing, tone, pacing, cinematography, beautiful location shooting (Paris, Rome, Budapest), special effects and stunts. Paul Feig comes from a Freaks & Geeks, The Office, Arrested Development background. Highly recommended. (seen once)The Nice Guys — 2016; directed & co-written by Shane Black; genuinely funny action-comedy buddy pic set in 1977 with Russell Crowe & Ryan Gosling; a young and absolutely great Margaret Qualley (Once Upon A Time In Hollywood), Kim Basinger. To-die-for ’70s funk soundtrack. Smart & really funny script. Maybe I was just in a good mood, but I laughed out loud multiple times. “That old lady’s got Coke bottles for glasses. Paint a mustache on a Volkswagen and she says ‘Boy that Omar Sharif sure runs fast.'” 🙂 Great performances by normally dramatic actors, including Gosling doing a perfect scared Lou Costello at one point. And all with pitch-perfect mid-’70s production design — set in the L.A. porn world, so obvious shades of Boogie Nights. Plus some subtle sweet nods to The Rockford Files and Pulp Fiction. This ain’t Citizen Kane, but when you want something light that’s great, this’ll make you smile. (seen once)\n\nMascots — 2016; directed & co-written by Christopher Guest (other writer Jim Piddock) – Michael Hitchcock, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey, Ed Begley Jr., Jane Lynch, Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Bob Balaban, Harry Shearer, Chris O’Dowd, Chris Guest reprising his Corky St. Clair character from Waiting For Guffman, Jim Paddock, Zach Woods, Sarah Baker, Susan Yeagley, Don Lake and a bunch of other great comic actors. Very much repeats Chris’s Best In Show format — a faux documentary with much of the same cast about a quirky crazy competition involving eccentric weirdos, in this case about small town sports team mascots. Manitoba is one of the ‘small town’ locations, although they didn’t actually shoot there. A Netflix original. (seen twice)\n\nBarbie — 2023; co-written (with husband Noah Baumbach) & directed by Greta Gerwig; Margot Robbie (who pushed for its creation and also produced it) & Ryan Gosling; with supporting roles by Kate McKinnon (who’s *great* as Weird Barbie!), America Ferrera, Will Farrell, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman, and narrated by Helen Mirren. Really fun, funny, twisted, silly, smart, camp movie that’s pretty to look at. Shades of La La Land not only with Ryan Gosling, but the surreal visually wild dance numbers. Movies about dolls coming to life aren’t really in my go-to wheelhouse, but I wanted to see this because of the colorful art direction, and the indie darling creators, and that both Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling so often knock it outta the park. I scanned the critic reviews then clicked on the Metacritic User Reviews and I’ve never seen the kind of negative reaction to any movie I’ve ever looked into! A bunch of people were giving it 0 out of 10! Then I found out about the reich-wing “review bombing” campaign against it by conservatives and anti-feminists, which of course made me start rooting for it. So, I saw it, and it’s definitely a chick flick. I often wonder how women respond to (put up with?) so many movies that have barely a female character in them. It was nice to experience the tables flipped. This is clearly a movie by, for and about women — certainly nothing wrong with that, and there should be a lot more of them. I haven’t yet seen the other weekend opener Oppenheimer, but I bet that’s mostly about men. I hope every woman who has the desire to see this, does. It’s certainly a women’s empowerment movie — a fun **lighthearted** women’s empowerment movie. I enjoyed the surreality of it, and the blending of fantasy worlds and the Real World. It’s sort of The Twilight Zone with Jim Gaffigan G-rated comedy. Oscar nominated for Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor for both Ryan Gosling & America Ferrera, the Terry Gilliam-like Best Production Design, as well as plus Costumes, and Billie Eilish won Best Original Song for Billie Eilish. It has a great soundtrack including Cyndi Lauper, the Indigo Girls, the Spice Girls & others — but, surprisingly, no Pink! It’s so absurd that there’s any backlash against this happy cotton candy of a film — especially over China which it has absolutely NOTHING to do with. The opening weekend brought in the highest gross in history for a woman director with $162M. Fun movies with women’s themes should be made more often!

John’s father Walter Huston makes an uncredited cameo as a good luck gesture towards his son’s debut. Leonardo DiCaprio owns one of the three Maltese falcons used in the movie, the most recent one sold at auction for $4 million (from a movie with a total original budget of $300,000), and he brought it to the set of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood where it can be seen in the rare book store Margot Robbie (Sharon Tate) goes to buy Tess of the d’Urbervilles.

I started watching it once or twice and found it REEEALLY boring — these old farts trudging around the desert and pawing in the dirt. Whoopy! was it actually filmed in slow motion?\n\nThen . . . ah, Then . . . on the 2nd or 3rd try all the pieces came together and now i recognize its mastery and why it’s one of the greatest films ever made. The original story, perhaps dating back to Chaucer, who could’ve picked it up from somebody else. Maybe it’s a lost Homer epic. The story is eternal. Like “absolute power corrupts absolutely.” — how greed can overpower an otherwise good man. How some, in the face of wealth, become a-holes, and others always retain a clear vision of what’s important in life (Howard/Walter). which kind of person are you? We all think, as Dobbs/Bogart did, that we would never become morally corrupted — yet we’ve seen in the real world (and as depicted in this movie) how that happens.\n\nThe arc of the Dobbs character is a classic in 2-hour cinema, and how Bogart portrays the transition from sanity and good-will into madness, greed & murder is up there with the greatest performances of any actor ever. the leprechaun magic of Walter Huston. The authenticity of the location shooting, including all the extras and bit roles. the depth, detail and polish of the script. the torn, sweat-soaked costumes. the fabulous music that mutates as the characters do.\n\nIf it was a standard western or movie in general, it all would have taken place in the first town and been about how they exacted revenge from the unscrupulous businessman who rips them off — the workers against the corporation.\n\nBut then the characters are taken beyond that to where they form their own limited partnership — and how some people turn out to be good and some don’t. It’s life.\n\nIf only we got to watch our own life movie several times until we got it. But since we can’t, you have another shot at this movie. It took my reincarnation as a viewer to finally get it right.\n\n“It wouldn’t be that way with me. I swear it wouldn’t. I’d take only what I set out to get.”\n\n😉\n\nBoy, would this be a great movie to see the alternate takes from!\n\nAnd think how Walter Huston’s performance pushed Bogart.\n\nTop 10 movie. B&W (4)\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire — 1951; Elia Kazan; Tennessee Williams; Marlon Brando, Vivian Lee, Kim Hunter, Karl Malden. B&W (4)\n\nThe Wild One — 1953; Laslo Benedek; Marlon Brando (riding his own Triumph motorcycle), Lee Marvin (as the leader of The Beetles!), Mary Murphy (who sorta tames Brando), and Alvy Moore who went on the play Hank Kimbell in Green Acres ITALICS (1965–71). Brando wrote of this movie in his autobiography: “More than most parts I’ve played in the movies or onstage, I related to Johnny, and because of this, I believe I played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned. There’s a line in the picture where he snarls, ‘Nobody tells me what to do.’ That’s exactly how I’ve felt all my life.The most famous exchange in the movie, “What are you rebelling against?” — “What have you got?” was first spoken by a member of the real biker gang members they hired to play themselves, and then incorporated into the script. The boppin’ pre-rock ‘n’ roll jazz score was by Julliard-trained normally-classical composer Leith Stevens. B&W (4)\n\nDial M For Murder — 1954; Alfred Hitchcock; from a great crime-mystery-thriller stage play (and screenplay) by Frederick Knott; gorgeous Grace Kelly (the first of 3 she made with Hitch), Ray Milland, Robert Cummings (as the American mystery writer), John Williams (as the inspector, reprising his Tony-winning Broadway performance of the role). Originally filmed in 3D, hence some of the odd placement of props in the extreme foreground. (3)\n\nRear Window — 1954; Alfred Hitchcock; Jimmy Stewart & Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Raymond Burr. B&W (4)\n\nEast of Eden — 1955; Elia Kazan; from John Steinbeck book; James Dean, Raymond Massey, Julie Harris, Burl Ives. James Dean’s first movie — filmed in the summer of 1954 when he was 23, and the only one released while he was still alive. Lots of location shooting in Salinas and Monterey, California. Kazan’s first movie shot in color. Steinbeck’s on the record liking the film, casting and performances. When he visited the set and first met Dean, he exclaimed, “Jesus Christ, he IS Cal!” With the unhappy dysfunctional family and struggling farm life story, this is my least favorite of Dean’s three pictures. (3)\n\nRebel Without A Cause — 1955; Nicholas Ray; original story by Nicholas Ray; James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Dennis Hopper (4)\n\nGiant — 1956; George Stevens; James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper (3)\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much — 1956; Alfred Hitchcock; James Stewart & Doris Day. (4)\n\n12 Angry Men — 1957; Sidney Lumet; Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, John Fielder, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, Ed Begley Sr., and a young Jack Klugman (3)\n\nCat On A Hot Tin Roof — 1958; Richard Brooks; Tennessee Williams’ play; Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, Burl Ives, Judith Anderson. In the middle of filming, Liz Taylor’s husband Mike Todd died in a plane crash. What an incredible performance she delivered in the middle of grief. Including while playing a woman whose father-in-law, Big Daddy, was dying. It’s all about the acting. And sex. (4)\n\nNorth By Northwest — 1959; Alfred Hitchcock; Gary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau — GREAT script and cinematography – great Manhattan location shots circa 1958; great Mount Rushmore shots. (4)\n\nPsycho — 1960; Alfred Hitchcock; Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam. Hitch hated location shooting. He wanted complete control of the shots. Every scene except Marion buying the used car was shot on the Universal backlot. Hitch planted rumors in Hollywood about the casting of the mother. 🙂 B&W (4)\n\nSwiss Family Robinson — 1960; Ken Annakin; loosely based on an 1812 novel; John Mills, Dorothy McGuire, John MacArthur, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran. Largely filmed on locations in Trinidad and Tobago. The movie had a big influence on George Lucas, and he revamped several scenes into his Star Wars movies. A rare widescreen Panavision movie for the time. This was sure a big movie for little boys (like me) in the ’60s. Fantastic tree house that I tried to build in my backyard and have kind-of always been looking for ever since seeing this. I’ve never seen it in writing, but there has to be some connection between the success of this movie and Gilligan’s Island four years later. The movie is the very manifestation of Disney’s corny whitewashed Father Knows Best-type family programming, and maybe a bit politically incorrect, and was made before laws protecting animals during filming, but it’s still a helluva rustic fantasy world and adventure they created. Funny — I remembered the battle with the pirates as the main part of the movie, but it’s only the last 15 minutes! (4)\n\nDr. No — 1962; Terence Young; Sean Connery, Ursula Andress. The first in the James Bond franchise. (3)\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? — 1966; Mike Nichols; Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, Sandy Dennis. The brilliant mesmerizing Shakespearian heavyweight rollercoaster based on Edward Albee’s Tony Award-winning Best Play. All his words of the play were the script, except for 2 lines, after the screenwriter who was paid and credited and delivered a disaster was still given writing credit. Mike Nichols’ directorial debut. (!) Liz Taylor had never rehearsed for a film performance before in her life — until Mike Nichols made all four of them work it up for 3 solid weeks. The four actors were all nominated for Oscars. Liz & Sandy won, plus for Best Cinematography, Art Direction & Costumes. This film drove a stake into the heart of film censorship and is kind of in a class of its own. Or in whatever class is the top of all movies ever made. B&W (4)\n\nGeorge & Martha’s house on the Smith College campus in Northampton, Mass. (taken post-LCK, October, 2015) All the rest of the exteriors were also shot around the house on the campus.\n\nIn The Heat of The Night — 1967; Norman Jewison (Torontonian); edited by Hal Ashby; Sidney Pottier, Rod Steiger, Warren Oates, Lee Grant, Anthony James (creepy diner guy); won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Actor for Steiger, Screenplay, Editing and Sound. Hal Ashby’s only Oscar win (for Best Editing). “They call me Mr. Tibbs.” This is such a masterpiece, but so many people don’t know it. Just tonight I sent out an email to get people to catch the PBS airing of it, and a few did, but one write back asking me if this was a “cult classic”?! 🙂 I’ve watched it many times – the next time you do, dig and study the ancillary music – it’s all Quincy Jones, and all the piano playing is Ray Charles, the organ by Billy Preston, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk on sax. Also listen for the diversity and both musical styles and instrumentation. The music got nominated for a Grammy but crazilly not an Oscar. This is an amazing movie for blind people. It almost sounds as good at it looks. (4)The Graduate — 1967; Mike Nichols; Buck Henry & Calder Willingham from a novel by Charles Webb; Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross, and Norman Fell, writer Buck Henry in a bit part. (4)\n\nCool Hand Luke — 1967; Stuart Rosenberg; Paul Newman, George Kennedy, Strother Martin (3)\n\nThe Dirty Dozen — 1967; Robert Aldrich; Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown, John Cassavetes, George Kennedy, Donald Sutherland, Trini Lopez (3)\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey — 1968; Stanley Kubrick; Kubrick screenplay from Arthur C. Clarke novel; Keir Dullea (3)\n\nThe Planet of The Apes — 1968; Franklin Shaffner; screenplay cowritten by Rod Serling; Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and some right-wing gun-pimping prick (4)\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang — 1968; Ken Hughes; Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes (4)\n\nMidnight Cowboy — 1969; John Schlesinger; Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight, Brenda Vaccaro, Sylvia Miles; won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Director for Schlesinger, and Screenplay. (3)\n\nEasy Rider — 1969; Dennis Hopper; written by Hopper, Peter Fonda & Terry Southern; starring Hopper & Fonda, early breakout role by Jack Nicholson, Karen Black (3)\n\nAirport — 1970; adapted (from Arthur Hailey’s novel) & directed by George Seaton; from Arthur Hailey novel; Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, George Kennedy, Jacqueline Bisset (25 yrs old), Helen Hayes (age 70, deservedly won Best Supporting Actress Oscar), Jean Seberg (Breathless), Van Heflen (bomber, his final film role), Maureen Stapleton, Barbara Hale, Lloyd Nolan, Larry Gates, Whit Bissell, Gary Collins, and Pat Priest (better known as Marilyn Munster, sitting behind Helen Hayes). Oscar nominated for Best Picture, Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Art Direction, Costumes (Edith Head), Original Score (Alfred Newman’s last), and Maureen Stapleton for Best Supporting. Great split screen effects. Universal thought it would be a dud but it ended up being the 2nd highest grossing film of 1970 (after Love Story). A staple of my childhood. Saw this many times in the theater and we watched it as a family every time it was on TV. My mom loved Helen Hayes, I loved Jacqueline Bisset. 🙂 Funny — they talk to the Toronto airport a bunch in the film. (4)\n\nLittle Big Man — 1970; Arthur Penn; Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Chief Dan George, Martin Balsam, William Hickey (3)\n\nThe French Connection — 1971; William Friedkin; Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider & a buncha badguys. Deservedly won Oscars for Best Picture, Director for Friedkin, Actor for Hackman, Screenplay, and Editing. And the music by Don Ellis is great. Poppy Doyle in the porkpie hat. Shot almost entirely on locations in New York City circa 1970. I love that there’s a street hockey game at night during the stakeout under the Brooklyn Bridge. 🙂 (4)\n\nA Clockwork Orange — 1971; Stanley Kubrick; Kubrick wrote screenplay from Anthony Burgess novel; Malcolm McDowell, Patrick Magee (3)\n\nHappy Birthday Wanda June — 1971; Mark Robson; written by Kurt Vonnegut; Rod Steiger, Susannah York, William Hickey; Steiger & Hickey give amazing performances. (4)\n\nCabaret — 1972; Bob Fosse; Liza Minelli, Joey Grey, Michael York (4)\n\nThe Candidate — 1972; Michael Ritchie; Robert Redford, Peter Boyle, Allan Garfield, Mike Barnicle, and a gorgeous Karen Carlson. (4)\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure — 1972; Ronald Neame; a great Gene Hackman, a touching Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons (who turned out to be a pretty good actor!), Jack Albertson, an accent-challenged Roddy McDowell, Pamela Sue Martin, Leslie Nielsen, Stella Stevens, Arthur O’Connell. Waddy Wachtel is the guitarist in the onboard band – he’d later go to play with Dylan, Keith Richards and a ton of others. Nominated for 10 Oscars, won for Best Visual Effects and Best Song (The Morning After, which soon became a #1 hit for Maureen McGovern.) Incredible upside-down art direction, creative cinematography, and a pretty good script. The highest grossing film of 1973. (I know I bought tickets several times. 🙂 ) Some of the pre-disaster footage was shot aboard the Queen Mary. I was pretty wide-eyed and on-the-edge-of-my-seat watching it for the first time in nearly 50 years in 2021. (4)\n\nDeliverance — 1972; John Boorman; writer James Dickey; Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox (3)\n\nSleuth — 1972; Joseph Mankiewicz; written by Anthony Schaffer; Lawrence Oliver, Michael Caine (4)\n\nThe Sting — 1973; George Roy Hill; Paul Newman, Robert Redford, a riveting Robert Shaw, Charles Durning (who’s in six movies on this page!), Ray Walston, Eileen Brennon, Harold Gould; won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Director for Hill, and quite deservingly – Screenplay, Art Direction, Costumes (Edith Head – won her 8th & final Oscar), Editing and Music by Marvin Hamlisch (via Scott Joplin). I’ve never forgotten watching live Liz Taylor’s announcement of it for Best Picture. And upon 2020 reviewing – don’t miss the cars! (4)\n\nPaper Moon — 1973; Peter Bogdanovich; Ryan O’Neal, Tatum O’Neal, Madeline Kahn, John Hillerman (in 2 brother roles), Burton Gilliam’s film debut, and Randy Quaid in a bit part. Tatum won the Oscar, the youngest person ever in a competitive category. Madeline Kahn was also nominated in the same category. Also deservedly nominated for Best Screenplay. Set in the depression, and filmed largely on locations in Missouri and Kansas. Brilliant cinematography by Laszlo Kovaks. Great film in every regard. When this played in the Gimli Theater in the summer of 1973, I saw it on Friday night … and went back again Saturday. B&W (4)\n\nLive and Let Die — 1973; Guy Hamilton; Roger Moore, Jane Seymour, Yaphet Kotto (3)\n\nAmerican Graffiti — 1973; George Lucas; Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Wolfman Jack, Harrison Ford. Set in 1962. (3)\n\nThe Paper Chase — 1973; James Bridges; Timothy Bottoms, John Houseman, Lindsay Wagner, Edward Hermann (3)The Towering Inferno — 1974; John Guillermin, action sequences directed by Irwin Allen; Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, Susan Blakely, Gregory Sierra (that lanky, balding Puerto Rican actor from Barney Miller and Hill Street Blues), and Mike Lookinland (Bobby Brady). The pair of cinematographers, Fred Koenekamp & Joseph Biroc, won the Oscar, and they were pretty imaginative, thoughtful and versatile, but rewatching this for the first time since the mid-’70s, I sure liked this movie a lot more when I was 13. 🙂 Didn’t notice until viewing it again nearly 50 years later, but there are huge plot holes in that the fire that originally started could have been easily put out with the fire hoses on the floor; and then there were all these explosions in a basically empty office tower with nothing explodable in it. It’s kind of a ridiculous, implausible, melodramatic and badly paced script. There are 85 “Goofs” listed on its IMDb page. How did we fall for this stuff? 🙂 All that said, there are a couple of real seat-of-your-pants suspenseful moments. And, according to IMDb, it was the highest-grossing movie of 1974. But no question — it’s a whole different movie to experience post the World Trade Centers on 9/11. (4)\n\nJaws — 1975; Stephen Spielberg; Peter Benchley novel & screenplay; Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Schnieder, Robert Shaw. The first movie to gross $100 million at the box office. (4)\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest — 1975; Miloš Foreman; based on parts of the novel by Ken Kesey; Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Scatman Crothers; won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Director for Miloš!, Actor for Jack, Actress for Louise Fletcher, and Screenplay. (4)\n\nTaxi Driver — 1976; Martin Scorsese; Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle. One of the three movies Tarantino cites as his Best Three ever made (along with Howard Hawks Rio Bravo and De Palma’s Blow Out). (3)\n\nNetwork — 1976; Sidney Lumet; written by Paddy Chayefsky (winning his third Best Screenplay Oscar); Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway & Beatrice Straight all won Best Actor Oscars, but Finch died of a heart attack before receiving his for becoming Howard Beale. This and A Streetcar Named Desire are the only 2 films in history to win 3 acting Oscars (!) — and as of 2021 it’s the last film to receive 5 acting nominations. Beatrice Straight’s 5 mins & 2 seconds of screen time is the shortest-ever Oscar-winning performance. Plus: William Holden, Robert Duvall & Ned Beatty are all drop-dead brilliant. Also Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Editing, and Holden & Beatty for Acting. Aaron Sorkin has cited the script as a big influence on his screenwriting. Love the name of the fictional network — UBS. 🙂 (3)\n\nStar Wars — 1977; George Lucas; Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness (4)\n\nKramer vs. Kramer — 1979; screenplay & directed by Robert Benton; Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Jane Alexander; won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Director for Benton, Actor for Hoffman, Actress for Streep, and Screenplay. (3)\n\nBeing There — 1979; Hal Ashby; novel & screenplay by Jerzy Kosinski; Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warden (4)\n\nApocalypse Now — 1979; directed and cowritten by Francis Ford Coppola; Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duval, Dennis Hopper (4)\n\nReturn of the Secaucus Seven — 1979; written & directed by John Sayles; John Sayles, David Strathairn, this movie is widely credited as the inspiration for The Big Chill, which many say was just a rip-off of this Sayles film. (3)\n\nThe Shining — 1980; Stanley Kubrick; Stephen King book, Kubrick screenplay; Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers (4)\n\nCarny — 1980; written & directed by Robert Kaylor; Jodie Foster, Gary Busey, Robbie Robertson (3)\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark — 1981; Steven Spielberg; Harrison Ford, Karen Allen (3)\n\nOn Golden Pond — 1981; Mark Rydell; Henry Fonda, Katherine Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman (3)\n\nE.T. the ExtraTerrestrial — 1982; Steven Spielberg; Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Peter Coyote, C. Thomas Howell’s first film; John Williams won for Best Score. Was the top-grossing film of all time until Spielberg’s own Jurassic Park beat it in 1993. (4)\n\nThe World According to Garp — 1982; George Roy Hill; John Irving novel; Robin Williams, Glenn Close, John Lithgow, Mary Beth Hurt, Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn (4)\n\nDeathtrap — 1982; Sidney Lumet; Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon (4)\n\nThe Big Chill — 1983; Lawrence Kasdan; Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Meg Tilly, Mary Kay Place, Tom Berringer (4)Places In The Heart — 1984; written & directed by Robert Benton; Sally Field, John Malkovich, Ed Harris, Danny Glover, Lindsay Crouse, Amy Madigan (3)\n\nParis, Texas — 1984; Wim Wenders; the idea came from Sam Shepard wanting to turn his book Motel Chronicles into a film – Shepard, Texas writer L.M. Kit Carson & Wenders all collaborated on the script; Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Stockwell, Nastassja Kinski. Perfect slide guitar soundtrack by Ry Cooder. Great casting & performances, and some good cinematography, but kind of a sad & depressing movie. (3)\n\nPrizzi’s Honor — 1985; John Huston; Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner, John Randolph, Angelica Huston (won best actress directed by her father, just as John had directed his father Walter to an Oscar in Treasure of the Sierra Madre), William Hickey’s brilliant performance (3)\n\nBack To The Future — 1985; written & directed by Robert Zemeckis; Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover (4)\n\nThe Breakfast Club — 1985; written & directed by John Hughes; Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Michael Anthony Hall, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Paul Gleason as the teacher, who spent time with Kerouac in Florida in the ’60s and tells a couple wonderful stories about it on the Extra disc in the 2012 Deluxe Edition of What Happened to Kerouac? 1986 (see entry in Beat Generation section below) (3)\n\nStand By Me — 1986; Rob Reiner; written by Stephen King; Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Cory Feldman, Jerry O’Connell, Kiefer Sutherland (3)\n\nMatewan — 1987; written & directed by John Sayles; Chris Cooper stars – and it’s his first movie! plus James Earl Jones, David Straithairn (4)\n\nBroadcast News — 1987; written & directed by James Brooks; William Hurt, Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter (4)\n\nWitches of Eastwick — 1987; George Miller; from John Updike book; Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon, Cher, Richard Jenkins (4)\n\nThe Untouchables — 1987; Brian de Palma; screenplay David Mamet; Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro (4)\n\nRain Man — 1988; Barry Levinson; Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Valeria Golino, plus cool cameo by Levinson as the doctor; won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Director for Levinson, Actor for Hoffman, and Screenplay. (3)\n\nMississippi Burning — 1988; Alan Parker; Gene Hackman, Willem Defoe, Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky (3)\n\nMidnight Run — 1988; Martin Brest; Robert De Niro & Charles Grodin (3)\n\nDead Poets Society — 1989; Peter Weir; Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard (4)\n\nDances With Wolves — 1990; dir. Kevin Costner; Costner, Graham Greene, Fred “Red Crow” Westerman; won Best Picture Oscar, Best Director for Costner, Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound, Editing & Music. (3)\n\nGhost — 1990; Jerry Zucker; Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze, Whoopie Goldberg (4)\n\nPretty Woman — 1990; Garry Marshall; Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Jason Alexander, Ralph Bellamy (3)\n\nMisery — 1990; Rob Reiner; from Stephen King book; Kathy Bates & James Caan (3)\n\nThelma & Louise — 1991; Ridley Scott; Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Harvey Keitel, Brad Pitt, Michael Madsen, Christopher McDonald (as Daryl), Stephen Tobolowsky (4)\n\nJFK — 1991; written & directed by Oliver Stone; cinematography by Robert Richardson – won Oscar for it; Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Sally Kirkland (3)\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross — 1992; James Foley; David Mamet play & screenplay; Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, Jonathan Pryce (4)\n\nDave — 1993; Ivan Reitman; Oscar-nominated screenplay by Gary Ross (who also wrote Big, Pleasantville & Seabiscuit); Kevin Kline (boy, that guy is one helluvan actor), Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella (a perfectly despicable badguy), Kevin Dunn (as Press secretary), Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley (who doesn’t appear until an hour 20 into the movie), Laura Linney, Charles Grodin, Stephen Root, Anna Deavere Smith, Bonnie Hunt; plus tons of cameos of entertainers and politicos playing themselves including — Tip O’Neill, Chris Dodd, Tom Harkin, Howard Metzenbaum, Alan Simpson, Paul Simon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Helen Thomas, Nina Totenberg, Sander Vanocur, Michael Kinsley, Jay Leno, Larry King, Ben Stein — and John McLaughlin, Eleanor Clift, Chris Matthews, Mort Kondracke & Freddie “The Beatle” Barnes in an improvised McLaughlin Group segment. Absolutely great political comedy about a doppelgänger (Kline) for the president being enlisted to fill in for him. Both Clinton & Obama loved this movie. And so do I. This is SUCH a great movie! I actually got choked up several times, but then I’m a softy that way. It’s a beautiful modern update on Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. (3)\n\nShort Cuts — 1993; Robert Altman; based on stories by Raymond Carver; Lily Tomlin & Tom Waits, Jennifer Jason Leigh & Chris Penn, Andie MacDowell & Bruce Davison, Julianne Moore & Matthew Modine, Fred Ward & Anne Archer, Tim Robbins & Madeleine Stowe, Francis McDormand & Peter Gallagher, Lili Taylor & Robert Downey Jr., Annie Ross & Lori Singer, Lyle Lovett, Buck Henry, Huey Lewis, Jack Lemmon. Music producer: Hal Willner. Great filmmaking by Altman, of course, with an unbelievable cast, but there’s no real through-plot, or character development, or any character I particularly gave a shit about. It’s just a montage of occasionally vaguely connected lives in and around LA. I LOVED The Player (which preceded this) and correctly got nominated for Best Screenplay, which this correctly did not. I get that there’s great performances by a to-die-for cast — cuz they wanna work with Altman — but it’s like a 3-hour soap opera recap. It’s maybe a good *idea* for a movie . . . but there’s too many storylines for any of them to be explored in depth … and the “short cuts” cause, at least this viewer, to not invest any emotion into any of these mostly duplicitous unethical heartless people. (3)\n\nForrest Gump — 1994; Robert Zemeckis; Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Field’. won Best Picture Oscar, Best Director for Zemeckis, Best Actor for Hanks, Screenplay, Editing, Special Effects. (4)\n\nPulp Fiction — 1994; written & directed by Quentin Tarantino; John Travota, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette (3)\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption — 1994; Frank Darabont; Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton (bad guy warden) (3)The Mask — 1994; Chuck Russell; Jim Carrey, 21-yr-old Camron Diaz in her first movie, Peter Riegert, Richard Jeni, Peter Greene. This was the movie that made both Jim Carrey & Cameron Diaz stars, and was the last time Carrey was paid less than $1 million for a role. (4)\n\nReality Bites — 1994; Ben Stiller; Ethan Hawk, Winona Ryder, Janeane Garofalo, Steve Zahn, Ben Stiller, Swoozie Kurtz (3)\n\nCasino — 1995; Martin Scorsese; book by Nicholas Pileggi, screenplay by Scorsese — the same duo who created Goodfellas; cinematography by the great Robert Richardson – the first time he & Scorsese worked their magic together; Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone (her sole Oscar nomination), Joe Pesci, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, Kevin Pollak, Alan King, L.Q. Jones, Dick Smothers, Katie Scorsese (Marty’s mom), and a Steve Allen cameo. A rare 3-hour movie. The great Saul Bass did the exquisite title sequence. And great sound editing. And, boy, what a climax! Scorsese considers Mean Streets, Goodfellas and this as a trilogy: the same men as young, coming up, and made it. From story to script to casting to art direction to costuming to cinematography to editing to soundtrack — THIS is a masterpiece miracle that Iñárritu talks about when he says: “To make a film is easy. To make a good film is war. To make a great film is a miracle.” (4)Fargo — 1996; written & directed by the Coen brothers; William H. Macy, Francis McDormand, Steve Buscemi, Harve Presnell (4)\n\nThat Thing You Do! — 1996; written & directed by Tom Hanks; Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Charlize Theron, Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Hanks (4)\n\nSling Blade — 1996; written & directed by Billy Bob Thornton; starring Thornton, J.T. Walsh, John Ritter, Dwight Yoakam (4)\n\nJerry Maguire — 1996; Cameron Crowe; Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr. (won Oscar for it), Renee Zellweger, Kelly Preston, Jay Mohr (3)\n\nBoogie Nights — 1997; Oscar-nominated Original Screenplay written & directed by Paul Thomas Anderson; mind-blowing cast — 25-yr-old Mark Wahlberg (how did he not get a Best Actor nomination?!), but Burt Reynolds & Julianne Moore correctly were! Plus William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman (appears 40 mins in and is riveting as always), John C. Riley, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, early Heather Graham, Joanne Gleason, Robert Ridgley, Nina Hartley, Ricky Jay, Philip Baker Hall (appears 70 mins in), Thomas Jane! (72 mins), Jack Riley. Set in San Fernando Valley beginning in 1977. Great filmmaking. Smart storytelling and script – deservedly Oscar nominated. Great interweaving story, cinematography, editing, pacing. Mind-blowing casting. SO many young actors who grew into full-on masters. Brilliant now-renown 4-minute opening ‘oner’ tracking shot introducing all the characters in the Hot Traxx dance club. This tells you right away you’re in for something special, a la The Player, Touch of Evil. Same type of opening as Babylon — where you meet everyone at the club/party, then follow each character home. Interesting smart original score and soundtrack cuts. The corny movies-within-a-movie porn scene dialog was lifted from real porn movies because Anderson wanted it authentic. Also a bit like Babylon in that the first half is the happy up-trail . . . and the second half is the downside. (3)\n\nTitanic — 1997; James Cameron; Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates; won Best Picture Oscar, plus Best Director, Cinematography, Editing, Art Direction, Costume Design, Sound, Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Song & Score – 11 total!

Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker, Michael Bowen. His followup to Pulp Fiction. Great mature character drama. Brilliant writing & filmmaking, as always.

Shot entirely on location in Italy. (4)\n\nPushing Tin — 1999; Mike Newell; Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie, John Cusack. not to mention Cate Blanchett and Vicki “NewsRadio” Lewis — fantastic performances by all. Plus a cameo by the great John Carroll Lynch (husband Norm in Fargo) as the scared Dr. Freeze. (3)\n\nThe Haunting — 1999; Jan de Bont; Catherine Zeta-Jones, Liam Neeson, Owen Wilson, Lili Taylor, Bruce Dern (4)\n\nMemento — 2000; Chris Nolan; screenplay by Nolan, from a short story by his younger brother Jonathan; Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantollano, Stanley Tobolowsky, Mark Boone Junior. (4)\n\nAlmost Famous — 2000; written & directed by Cameron Crowe; Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Francis McDormand, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin, Zooey Deschanel (3)\n\nCast Away — 2000; Robert Zemeckis; Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt. Best plane crash scene I’ve ever seen on film. (3)Requiem for a Dream — 2000; Darren Aronofsky; Hubert Selby wrote; Jared Leno, Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn (3)\n\n28 Days — 2000; Betty Thomas; Sandra Bullock, Dominik West, Viggo Mortensen; about rehab, really good; small role for Steve Buchemi. (3)\n\nHappy Accidents — 2000; written & directed by Brad Anderson; Vincent D’Onofrio, Marisa Tomei – who are both great. About time travel and love. Set in SoHo / Lower East Side with lots of location shooting. Really engaging and wonderful film with priceless performances by Vince & Marisa. One of the only movies with science fiction elements that I actually enjoyed. (3)Adaptation — 2002; Spike Jonze; Charlie Kaufman’s ingenious Oscar-nominated screenplay; Nicholas Cage & Meryl Streep – both Oscar-nominated, Chris Cooper (who won for Best Supporting), Tilda Swinton, the director Curtis Hanson (in his only role ever as an actor), Ron Livingston, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Brian Cox, Judy Greer. A brilliant twisted funny Oscar-winning comedy about writing — that also happens to include the two most terrifying car crash scenes I’ve ever seen on film. Plus it features one of my favorite songs from the ’60s — Happy Together! (3)\n\nSecret Window — 2004; David Koepp; from a Stephen King novel; Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Maria Bello; music Philip Glass. (4)\n\nThe Departed — 2006; Martin Scorsese; Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen; Won Oscars for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Editing, and Scorsese finally for Best Director (4)\n\nDeath Proof — 2007; written & directed by Quentin Tarantino; Kurt Russell, Zoë Bell (in an unbelievable performance in basically her first movie, and she doesn’t appear until 65 minutes into it — yet steals the show), Rosario Dawson, Rose McGowan, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Tracie Thoms, Eli Roth, Michael Parks, Tarantino as the bar owner, AMi the jukebox (Tarantino’s), and Sydney Tamila Poitier (Sidney’s daughter) as Jungle Julie with the incredible hair. Tarantino built this movie around a desire to film a classic car chase scene … and having a stuntwoman who could be an engaging lead on camera. It’s his attempt at doing the greatest car chase scene ever — and the climactic 20 minutes of the movie certainly put it in contention. 😉 He made a point to credit himself as the Director of Photography which is quite visible in the imaginative and brilliantly filmed climactic sequence. Done as a homage to ’70s car chase movies, specifically Vanishing Point, including the cool music (by Jack Nitzsche) and physically scratching & damaging the print to make it look old. Contains a signature Tarantino 8-minute continuous shot with the four girls at a round table in a diner a la Reservoir Dogs at the start of the second half. After three viewings, I really like this least-seen lowest-rated QT film. (3)\n\nCharlie Wilson’s War — 2007; Mike Nichols; Aaron Sorkin; Tom Hanks, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julia Roberts, Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Peter Gerety (3)\n\nSleuth — 2007; great filmmaking by Kenneth Branagh; Harold Pinter wrote a brilliant new screenplay based on Anthony Shaffer’s original Tony Award-winning play; both the playwright & screenwriter are British; Michael Caine & Jude Law in maybe his best film performance, he was also the one who spearheaded the film getting made — it was largely a creation of Law & Pinter . . . and a remake of Joe Mankiewicz’s 1972 film of the same name with Laurence Olivier & Michael Caine, which took 16 weeks to shoot. This was done in 4. And it was all shot chronologically. Great art direction/production design by Tim Harvey who’s done all of Branagh’s movies. Brilliant lighting. Great subtle score — minimal music — cello, viola & grand piano. I saw this on the stage in London in 1972 with the original defining cast. (seen 3 times if you count commentaries)\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall — 2008; Nicholas Stoller; Jason Segel, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Steve Landesberg (in his last film role) (3)\n\nInglourious Basterds — 2009; Quentin Tarantino; Robert Richardson Oscar nominated for his cinematography; Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth, Rod Taylor, Mike Myers (4)\n\nMoneyball — 2011; Bennett Miller; Aaron Sorkin co-wrote; Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Chris Pratt, Spike Jonze. I’m not really a baseball fan, but this character-rich real-story drama about a revolutionary process of putting together a winning team with a low budget is compelling from start to finish. Nominated for Best Picture, Screenplay, Editing, and both Brad & Jonah’s Acting. (4)\n\nBlue Jasmine — 2013; brilliant, deep, emotive Oscar-nominated for Best Screenplay & directed by Woody Allen; Cate Blanchett most deservedly won Best Lead Actress Oscar, Sally Hawkins (nominated for Best Supporting Actress), Alex Baldwin, Bobby Cannavale (great), Andrew Dice Clay (who’s actually not a bad actor), Peter Sarsgaard, Louis C.K. About a wealthy woman losing everything. Inspired by blending Bernie Madoff’s wife with A Streetcar Named Desire. Spectacularly perfect old jazz & blues music — as always, chosen by Woody. Brilliant title once you’ve seen this absolutely great movie. And great location shooting, as per Woody. (3)\n\nDjango Unchained — 2012; written & directed by Quentin Tarantino; Robert Richardson Oscar nominated for his cinematography; Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, Don Johnson, Jonah Hill, Bruce Dern, Michael Parks, and with tiny cameos as the trackers holding Kerry Washington, Michael Parks’ son James, Robert Carradine (younger brother of David), and his half-brother Michael Bowen, Zoe Bell, and Ted Neeley in the chair (Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar – his first film appearance in 30 years). Won Oscar for Best Screenplay, and Waltz for Best Actor. Also nominated for Best Picture & Cinematography for Robert Richardson. Tarantino wanted to make a classic Western – but with a black hero – because there are no Westerns that black people can watch with a brother to root for. And all done with smatterings of humor. Fantastic filmmaking, as always. (3)\n\nSilver Linings Playbook — 2012; written & directed by David O. Russell; Jennifer Lawrence won her Best Lead Actress Oscar; Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro & Jacki Weaver all Oscar nominated, first time a picture got all 4 since Reds in 1981. Plus Chris Tucker (other than Rush Hour, his first film since Jackie Brown), Julia Stiles, Paul Herman. Also nominated for Best Picture, and the brilliant Screenplay, Director, Editing. A great movie about how broken people can deal with life — something we can all relate to. (3)\n\nOn The Road — 2012 — film version of the iconic novel finally hit the screen 65 years after the adventure, 61 years after the Scroll was written, 55 years after publication, 33 years after Coppola bought the rights, and 8 years after the director Walter Salles was approached; over 60,000 miles covered in the filming; ironically it took an international consortium to get this Great American Novel filmed — a Brazilian director, French producers, cinematographer & editor, British actors, Argentineans doing the art direction and score composition, a Puerto Rican screenwriter, and it was mostly filmed in Canada — directed by Walter Salles — starring Sam Riley as Jack; Garrett Hedlund as Neal; Kristen Stewart as LuAnne; Kirsten Dunst as Carolyn; Tom Sturridge as Allen; Viggo Mortensen as Bill; Amy Adams as Joan; Danny Morgan as Al Hinkle, and Elisabeth Moss as Helen Hinkle. Also includes surprise appearances by Steve Buscemi, Terrence Howard, and Coati Mundi as Slim Gaillard. Notable for its use of the scroll version of On The Road rather than the ’57 version; the cinematography, the editing, the musical score, the art direction, the location shooting, the actors’ camaraderie & improvising, Viggo’s Burroughs and Kristen’s LuAnne. It’s its own work of art — based on an existing work of art. Color, 126 min. (revised North American version); 137 min. (original European version)\n\nHere’s a story of going to the U.K. premiere in London.\n\nHere’s the tale of being at the North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and meeting Walter Salles.\n\nHere’s what it was like being atthe New York premiere and afterparty.\n\nHere’s the amazing Cannes press conference — absolute required viewing for anyone interested in this movie.\n\nHere’s the cool trailer.\n\nHere’s three minutes from early in the movie where Sal & Dean are talking about their missing fathers, into Dean parking cars.\n\nHere’s the new year’s eve party dancing scene.\n\nHere’s Marylou and Sal in the car.\n\nHere’s Sal & Camille dancing together to Ella Fitzgerald in the roadhouse.\n\nHere’s the six deleted scenes that are included on the French DVD as Extras. (4)\n\nOr the stories of seeing the screenings are also available in How The Beats Begat The Pranksters along with a whole bunch of other Beat tales and Adventures.\n\nKill Your Darlings — 2013; directed by first-timer John Krokidas; incredible cast — Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg; Dane DeHaan as Lucien Carr; Jack Huston (John’s grandson) as Jack Kerouac; Ben Foster as William Burroughs; Michael C. Hall as David Kammerer; Kyra Sedgwick as Lucien’s mother; Elizabeth Olson (the twins’ younger sister) as Edie Parker; Jennifer Jason Leigh and David Cross as Ginsberg’s parents; and John Cullum as the Columbia English teacher. Allen Ginsberg’s coming of age story from entering Columbia through the David Kammerer killing, which was the subject of the early Kerouac/Burroughs co-authored novel And The Hippos Were Boiled In Their Tanks. The film’s title comes from the William Faulkner line, “In writing, you must kill your darlings,” meaning you sometimes have to delete your favorite passage for the betterment of the story. Sadly, the Kerouac character is very much minimized, gay themes are stressed, women are portrayed as shrews, and there’s tons of perplexing factual inaccuracies in a film that presents itself as “a true story.” (4)\n\nYou can read my full detailed review from its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival here.\n\nBig Sur — 2013; screenplay adaptation and directed by Michael Polish; starring Jean-Marc Barr as Kerouac; Josh Lucas as Neal; Kate Bosworth as Billie (Jacky Gibson); Patrick Fischler is great as Lew Welch; Anthony Edwards as Ferlinghetti; Radha Mitchell as Carolyn; Balthazar Getty as McClure; Henry Thomas as Philip Whalen; and gorgeous Stana Katic as Lenore Kandel. The second major Kerouac novel released as a movie in a year — a 180 degree counterpoint vision to the youth and optimism of On The Road. Setting aside Pull My Daisy, this is probably the best portrayal of Jack and his writing on film. Hauntingly shot on location in Big Sur and S.F., including an evocative cabin set. Definitely the most artfully lensed and edited (visually composed) of any of the Kerouac films. Roughly 80% of the dialogue is voiceover of Jack’s own Big Sur prose. They use the real names for everybody, not the novel’s fictional ones. Beautiful haunting minimalist electric guitar and grand piano score by the Dessner twin brothers from The National. (3)\n\nHere’s the trailer.\n\nGet Out — 2017; written & directed by Jordan Peele; Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Stephen Root, Lil Ray Howery, Erika Alexandra. Deservedly won Best Screenplay. (3)\n\nKnives Out — 2019; written & directed by Rian Johnson; Daniel Craig (playing a very deep colorful private investigator), Christopher Plummer (his second last movie after 60 years of making them, playing an old man about to die!), Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Frank Oz (the actor/director, Yoda and Muppet pioneer), Emmet Walsh (replacing Ricky Jay who died just before the film went to production) and a great not-too-well-known 30-year-old Cuban actress Ana de Armas. This film is everything great filmmaking is: an ever-twisting script; surprising Tarantinoesque casting; masterful cinematography & editing (pacing); perfect sound editing, production design art direction that makes you salivate; the blend of killer location shooting and to-die-for sets; a surprise third act with a classic dramatic mystery movie soliloquy reveal . . . everything you want in a movie! I literally got goosebumps – more than once. What A Script! No wonder it was nominated for Best Screenplay Oscar. And it should have been for Best Editing, Sound Editing, Costume Design and Original Score. Theme: be a good person. On third viewing, I laughed out loud a buncha times once I knew the characters and story. And What A House that it’s set in and around! Gorgeous evocative Production Design and Art Direction! Bonus points for the spectacular score by Nathan Johnson (cousin of Rian Johnson), and a killer soundtrack including Animal Zoo by Spirit in the background then to prominence in big scene, plus Roxy Music, Gordon Lightfoot & the Rolling Stones. Rian the writer/director said in the commentary all the names of the family members/couples are ’70s rock stars: Joni Mitchell & Neil Young, Richard & Linda Thompson, Walt & Donna are Walter Becker & Donald Fagen (Steely Dan). I like this guy. (4)\n\nOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywood — 2019; written & directed by Quentin Tarantino; Robert Richardson Oscar nominated for his cinematography; Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margo Robbie, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Kurt Russell, Al Pacino, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Emile Hirsch. Rightly nominated for 10 Oscars — the top five films in every category for that year. It rightly won two. Production Design and Brad Pitt’s acting. But shoulda won all ten. Every time I watch this – prolly 6 or 7 times by now – I think, “This is a brilliant masterpiece of filmmaking in every regard.” Here’s a great documentary on the making of it. (4)\n\nBiopics (non music) [76]\n\nLust For Life— 1956; Vincente Minelli, father of Liza; based on book by Irving Stone; Kirk Douglas, Anthony Quinn (4)\n\nCleopatra — 1963; co-written and directed by Joseph Mankiewicz; Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Hume Cronyn, Martin Landau, Roddy McDowall. Won Oscars for Best Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design (26,000 of them! including a record-breaking 65 for Liz alone) & Visual Effects; nominated for Best Picture, Rex Harrison as Julius Caesar for Best Actor, Editing, Music & Sound. At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever made. It ended up not only basically bankrupting 20th Century Fox, but also ending the studio system in Hollywood. Legendary for it’s production cost overruns and general production mismanagement. Four hour epic. Mankiewicz original wanted it to be two movies — Caesar & Cleopatra, and Anthony & Cleopatra, but the studio nixed it. It’s where Taylor & Burton met and fell for each other, and is the first of 11 pictures they made together. (seen once)\n\nBonnie and Clyde — 1967; Arthur Penn; Warren Beatty & Faye Dunaway (both Oscar nominated), Estelle Parsons (won Best Supporting Actress), Michael J. Pollard (nominated for Best Supporting), Gene Hackman and Gene Wilder. Spectacular filmmaking from a great Oscar nominated script. Won for Best Cinematography (Burnett Guffey). Foundation film of the sexy “New Hollywood” antihero movies. (4)\n\nIn Cold Blood — 1967; screenplay and directed by Richard Brooks; based on the Truman Capote “fictional novel” / New Journalism book; Robert Blake & Scott Wilson as the killers, John Forsythe as the detective, Jeff Corey. No other “movie stars” were cast as director Brooks wanted it to seem like a real documentary; most of the smaller roles were filled by Kansans. An amazing movie, nominated for Best Director, Screenplay, Cinematography (in part because of the rain on Blake’s face shot) and the super-cool Music by Quincy Jones (immediately following In The Heat of The Night, see above, {which also starred Scott Wilson, these being his first two movies}, and including a song partly played on bottles during the bottle collection scene). Largely shot on location, including inside & outside the Clutter family’s actual home & farm, the courtroom where the trial took place (with six actual jurors playing jurors), the suit store where they passed a bad check using the very salesman they’d conned, the store where they bought the rope and tape, and the bus depot. The two killers talk about the movie The Treasure of the Sierra Madre which a young Robert Blake was in as the young kid who sold Humphrey Bogart the winning lottery ticket. It was killer Perry Smith’s favorite movie. The first mainstream American movie to use the word “bullshit” on screen. B&W (seen once)\n\nButch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid — 1969; George Roy Hill; written by William Goldman; Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross, Strother Martin, Jeff Corey, plus Cloris Leachman in a bit part, and Sam Elliott playin cards. Originally planned as Steve McQueen & Paul Newman. Shot in both sepia and color. (4)\n\n10 Rillington Place — 1971; Richard Fleischer; Richard Attenborough, and an incredible John Hurt. Dramatization of a real British serial killer circa 1953. (2)\n\nPapillon — 1973; dir. Franklin Schaffne"
