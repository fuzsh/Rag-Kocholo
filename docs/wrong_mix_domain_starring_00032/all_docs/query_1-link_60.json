Fox, Daryl Hannah\n\nGenre: Action, Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: N/A\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 85% (Critics), 81% (Audience)\n\nAlthough they were released as two separate films, Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2 are for all cinematic purposes a single movie—including counting as one entry in Tarantino’s career-promised ten. Utilizing the same nonlinear chapter style narrative as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Vol.1 kicks off by tossing us headfirst into the middle of the story and a bloody fight scene between our lead The Bride aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) and Vernita Green aka Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox). The result is a highly entertaining, almost murder-mystery layer of interaction added to the film, where highly stylized flashbacks, witty barbs, and the masterful visuals one has come to expect from Tarantino slowly unravel a deeply personal story of revenge. After waking from a four-year coma, the ex-assassin, simply known as The Bride in Vol.1, creates a hit-list seeking payback on Bill, her former lover and boss, and his deadly team of top-notch killers who tried yet failed to finish her. A visual feast ensues as the list carries us through Vol.1 to 2 where we’re given more information about The Bride’s, Bill’s, and the assassination squad’s origins and eventually their bloody demise. If you’re tired of the usual blasé action movies, a Tarantino fan, or simply appreciate unique storytelling there are few movies that are guaranteed to entertain quite like Kill Bill.\n\nFilth (2013)\n\nDirector: Jon S.

Finishing off with one hell of a final twist, The Machinist is a small budget big bang treat for anyone looking for a truly wild thriller.\n\nMiracle on 34th Street (1947)\n\nDirector: George Seaton\n\nCast: Edmund Gwenn, Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, William Frawley\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama, Christmas\n\nRating: N/A\n\nRuntime: 1h 41m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 96% (Critics), 87% (Audience)\n\nMust be the season because the most famous Christmas movie of all time has just made its return to Prime Video. When the actor playing Santa gets too drunk for his role in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade, it’s up to Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) to fill in. After doing such a great job he’s hired on to play the in-store Santa at Macy’s flagship, but quickly runs into trouble when his claims of being the real deal land him in the loony bin. One little girl’s belief, the spirit of Christmas, and a reminder of what the holiday season is all about rescues Santa from his imprisonment though, and makes for one of the most heartwarming movies of all time.\n\n10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\n\nDirector: Gil Junger\n\nCast: Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, Andrew Keegan, Gabrielle Union\n\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 13m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 71% (Critics), 69% (Audience)\n\nHailed as one of the last great rom-coms, 10 Things I Hate About You tells the story of Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles), a high school senior as intelligent as she is romantically hopeless. Kat’s little sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is determined to change that though. Tied down by a house rule not allowing her to date till Kat does, Bianca and her would-be boyfriend Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) decide to set Kat up. Their pick, the school’s bad boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), isn’t interested though, so Joey decides to pay him. While a decent, if not groundbreaking plot, it’s the stellar cast and undeniable chemistry shared between them that makes 10 Things I Hate About You a classic. Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles make for the perfect hate to love relationship, while Larisa Oleynik and an extremely young Joseph Gordon-Levitt sell every second of their will they/won’t they crush.\n\nMinority Report (2002)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Max von Sydow, Neal McDonough, Peter Stormare, Frank Grillo\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi, Mystery\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 2h 24m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 90% (Critics), 80% (Audience)\n\nTom Cruise and Colin Farrell team up in this nail-biting sci-fi directed by Steven Spielberg.

John Anderton (Cruise) serves as the commanding officer and the head of the police enforcement branch of Precrime. Swooping in and arresting murderers before they kill, John has no doubt he’s doing the right thing. That is, until his name pops up for a future murder he knows he would never commit. Hunted by his own unit, John must now prove his innocence for a crime that hasn’t happened while combing through his past arrests to find any clues or mistakes that might tell him why this is happening.\n\nMy Policeman (2022)\n\nDirector: Michael Grandage\n\nCast: Harry Styles, David Dawson, Emma Corrin, Linus Roache, Rupert Everett, Gina McKee\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 53m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 40% (Critics), 97% (Audience)\n\nA new British period romance as passionate as it is heartbreaking, My Policeman tells the story of Tom Burgess (Harry Styles), a cop in 1950s Britain torn between his love of law and country, and the illegal affair he’s engaged in with another man. Already married to schoolteacher Marion Taylor (Emma Corrin), a love triangle erupts as the couple befriend closeted museum curator Patrick Hazlewood (Rupert Everett). Initially insinuating the possibility of a triste between Marion and Patrick, the secret of Patrick and Tom’s love soon reveals itself through a web of complicated feelings, made evermore complicated by the character’s own prejudices and the country’s outlawing of homosexuality. Although set in the 1950s, My Policeman tells a timeless story of love and loss set against the backdrop of the British coast.\n\nFace/Off (1997)\n\nDirector: John Woo\n\nCast: Nicolas Cage, John Travolta, Dominique Swain, Alessandro Nivola, Thomas Jane, Danny Masterson, Tommy Flanagan, Robert Wisdom, John Carroll Lynch\n\nGenre: Action, Sci-fi\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h 13m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 92% (Critics), 82% (Audience)\n\nComing by way of legendary director John Woo, this trippy action flick starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta will make you realize just how much you miss the ’90s.

Things quickly go wrong though, leaving Archer severely wounded and Troy in a coma. Willing to stop at nothing to stop the attack, Archer enlists the help of plastic surgeon Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore) with an experimental surgery in which Troy’s face and voice box are swapped with his own. Using his new disguise as Troy to uncover info about the upcoming attack, Archer soon finds out that the real Troy has taken a page out of his own book, undergoing the same surgery, putting not only Archer’s loved ones at risk, but the entire country.\n\nThe Northman (2022)\n\nDirector: Robert Eggers\n\nCast: Alexander Skarsgård, Anya Taylor-Joy, Björk, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h 17m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 89% (Critics), 64% (Audience)\n\nThe Viking craze continues with its bloodiest, most star-studded outing yet. Two decades after watching his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) murder his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) and kidnap his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has finally set out to reclaim his crown and gain his vengeance.

Norse myth mixes with modern storytelling, while magic and mayhem collide to provide the best Viking feature film you’ve ever seen.\n\nAmerican Animals (2018)\n\nDirector: Bart Layton\n\nCast: Evan Peters, Barry Keoghan, Blake Jenner, Jared Abrahamson, Udo Kier, Ann Dowd\n\nGenre: Crime, Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 88% (Critics), 81% (Audience)\n\nTerrified of mediocrity, bored of everyday life, and largely lacking a moral compass, college student Spencer Reinhard (Barry Keoghan), along with friends Warren Lipka (Evan Peters), Eric Borsuk (Jared Abrahamson), and Chas Allen (Blake Jenner) decide to rob a multimillion dollar book from their student library. Zero experience breaking the law, while also making their plans under the effects of alcohol might stop most would-be robbers. But not this crew. As thrilling as any big blockbuster film to date (while lacking the same budget), American Animals instead relies on a wildly innovative script and its cast of Hollywood up-and-comers to deliver scenes, screams, and laughs that make it a must-watch for any fan of the crime genre.\n\nThe Hunger Games (2012)\n\nDirector: Gary Ross\n\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Josh Hutcherson, Lenny Kravitz, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 2h 22m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 84% (Critics), 81% (Audience)\n\nAmbulance (2022)\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eiza González, Garret Dillahunt, Keir O’Donnell\n\nGenre: Action, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h 16m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 68% (Critics), 88% (Audience)\n\nMy Best Friend’s Exorcism (2022)\n\nDirector: Damon Thomas\n\nCast: Elsie Fisher, Amiah Miller, Chris Lowell, Clayton Royal Johnson\n\nGenre: Horror, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 36m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 50% (Critics), 42% (Audience)\n\nBased on the hit Grady Hendrix novel of the same name, My Best Friend’s Exorcism follows Abby Rivers (Elsie Fisher) and Gretchen Lang (Amiah Miller), two besties whose lives are forever changed during the school year of 1988.

Stumbling across something terrifying, all three girls split and run, but Gretchen falls behind. Abby goes back for her BFF, only to find her physically unharmed but somehow different. Not quite able to put her finger on what’s wrong with Gretchen, Abby starts to investigate, eventually discovering that her best friend is indeed possessed by a demon. Playing off the classic exorcism tropes to hilarious effect, as well as going all in on ’80s pop culture, you’ll soon find yourself happily immersed in a world of teenage angst, demons, and neon fanny packs.\n\nAll the Old Knives (2022)\n\nDirector: Janus Metz Pedersen\n\nCast: Chris Pine, Thandie Newton, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Williams, Laurence Fishburne\n\nGenre: Thriller, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 41\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 64% (Critics), 45% (Audience)\n\nA resurrection of the hard-boiled spy thriller Hollywood has long thought dead, All the Old Knives brings the brains back to espionage. CIA officer Henry Pelham (Chris Pine) has just been put back on a case he thought he’d closed eight years prior. Informed that the investigation had been compromised due to a mole, Henry is forced to return to the shady back alleys of Vienna, Austria to confront former allies and lovers alike. Tangling personal relationships with international acts of terrorism, the concepts of loyalty to one’s job and country come head-to-head with matters of the heart. As Henry sorts through a spider web of lies his own thoughts only become more tangled, putting not only his life in danger, but that of the public’s. Director Janus Metz Pedersen brilliantly captures every tense moment, emulating classics such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Hitchcock’s Notorious to infuse every scene with a looming sense of dread.\n\nMemory (2022)\n\nDirector: Martin Campbell\n\nCast: Liam Neeson, Monica Bellucci, Guy Pearce, Ray Stevenson\n\nGenre: Action\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 54m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 28% (Critics), 81% (Audience)\n\nSpell (2020)\n\nDirector: Mark Tonderai\n\nCast: Omari Hardwick, Loretta Devine, Lorraine Burroughs, Tumisho Masha\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 31m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 49% (Critics), 56% (Audience)\n\nBull (2019)\n\nDirector: Annie Silverstein\n\nCast: Rob Morgan, Amber Havard, Yolonda Ross\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 90% (Critics), 89% (Audience)\n\nThe Outfit (2022)\n\nDirector: Graham Moore\n\nCast: Zoey Deutch, Mark Rylance, Dylan O’Brien, Johnny Flynn, Simon Russell Beale\n\nGenre: Crime, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 85% (Critics), 92% (Audience)\n\n1956 Chicago is jam packed with criminals, but also home to simple folk like Leonard Burling (Mark Rylance), an elderly tailor who works alongside his seemingly innocent receptionist Mable (Zoey Deutch). Working late one night, Leonard is burst in upon by an Irish mobster and his injured compatriot. Forced at gunpoint to sew the man up, the story of why and what the mobsters are hiding comes to light as more gangsters from across the city flood into the tailor’s little shop. Far from a shoot-em-up, a vast array of top-tier actors and a taught script are used to replace cliché violence and keep you guessing till the very end. This Chicago mob meets psychological thriller truly is one of streaming’s most unique crime movies right now.\n\nSamaritan (2022)\n\nDirector: Julius Avery\n\nCast: Sylvester Stallone, Javon Walton, Pilou Asbæk, Sophia Tatum, Martin Starr\n\nGenre: Action\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 39m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 40% (Critics), 75% (Audience)\n\nAfter Joe (Sylvester Stallone) saves his 13-year-old neighbor Sam (Javon Walton) from a group of bullies, Sam starts to suspect him of being more than just your average senior citizen. Striking up a friendship, the boy soon discovers the old man’s true identity is the long thought dead superhero Samaritan. With the truth revealed, the city’s newest baddie, Cyrus (Pilou Asbæk), tries to take Joe down. Things don’t go quite as Cyrus hopes though, and he decides to kidnap Sam to trap the once invulnerable hero. Forced to make peace with his own demons or once again lose the ones he loves, Joe re-dons the title of Samaritan and sets out to see if he still has what it takes. Far from your standard comic book to big screen conversion, Samaritan mixes gritty violence with blue-collar characters for an action-packed addition to the superhero genre.\n\nBlack Bear (2020)\n\nDirector: Lawrence Michael Levine\n\nCast: Aubrey Plaza, Christopher Abbott, Sarah Gadon, Paola Lázaro, Grantham Coleman\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 44m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 89% (Critics), 59% (Audience)\n\nManic, neurotic, terrifying, and hilarious, Black Bear will leave you wondering what you just watched, and why the hell you haven’t seen it sooner. Allison (Aubrey Plaza) is a writer/director seeking solace from the big city to finish her new script. Gabe (Christopher Abbott) and Blair (Sarah Gadon) are a young couple who have decided to host upcoming artists in their rural cabin. The meeting between the two women starts out awkward and only gets worse as faux smiles and even faker compliments are exchanged. Cut back to the meeting and things go differently. That’s right, it’s a redo. So, does that mean it didn’t happen the first time, or is this all just part of Allison’s script? Emotions run high, fights happen, and a whole lot of red wine is consumed in this backwoods mind bender that is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end.\n\nFight Club (1999)\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nCast: Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, Marvin Lee Aday, Holt McCallany\n\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h 19m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 79% (Critics), 96% (Audience)\n\nTrue, you already know the twist ending. And yes, the umpteen number of project mayhem frat boys that preach why it’s the greatest film ever is enough to make you puke; but take it from someone who just re-watched Fight Club for the first time in a decade, it’s not what you remember. Blood, sweat, and twist are all still present, but upon new viewing they greatly shrink in significance. What takes their place is brilliant directing, sharp dialogue, and commanding acting. Director David Fincher’s aggressive cuts perfectly communicate the character’s mindsets and transforms Fight Club’s every frame into a psychological thriller masterpiece. The only thing faster than the camerawork is the dialogue. Spouted from the mouths of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Carter, understated lines picking apart the same toxic masculinity the film has long been misinterpreted as promoting jump out at you, offering a new appreciation for one of the ’90s greatest movies.\n\nThe Lost City (2022)\n\nDirector: Aaron Nee, Adam Nee\n\nCast: Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Brad Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, Da’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 52\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 79% (Critics), 83% (Audience)\n\nMove aside Indiana Jones because The Lost City is coming for the treasure hunting crown. Widow and acclaimed romance novelist Dr. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is talked into going on a book tour with her novel’s cover model Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum). Midway through the tour Loretta is kidnapped by a crazy treasure hunting billionaire after he realizes she’s based her books on her late husband’s research. Secretly in love with the woman that gave him his fame, Alan sets out to rescue the good doctor, but with none of his character’s skills they both end up lost in the jungle. Now it’s up to Loretta and her bumbling would-be savior to find the real-life treasure and escape with their lives. Action packed, hilarious, and star-studded, there’s literally no reason why you shouldn’t stream The Lost City on Prime right now.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)\n\nDirector: Jeff Fowler\n\nCast: Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, Colleen O’Shaughnessey, Tika Sumpter\n\nGenre: Family, Action\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 2h 2m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 69% (Critics), 96% (Audience)\n\nThirteen Lives (2022)\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nCast: Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, Joel Edgerton, Tom Bateman, Teeradon Supapunpinyo\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 2h 27m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 88% (Critics), 94% (Audience)\n\nBased on what was arguably one of the biggest news stories of 2018, Thirteen Lives shows every detail of the dramatic Tham Luang Nang Non cave rescue. While technically in Thailand’s monsoon season, June 23, 2018 was turning out to be a beautiful day. So much so that when 12 members of a youth soccer team and their coach took shelter from a drizzle in a local cave, they thought it would be for no more than a few minutes. Come nightfall, when the boys still hadn’t returned, their families went out searching. Discovering clues that led them to believe their kids were trapped in the cave due to flooding, an international team of specialists were called in. With weeks passing before contact was made with the children and their coach, rescue teams knew they were racing against the clock to get them out alive. Politics, international attention, an ever-increasing rainfall, and the dangers of an underwater maze make this real-life ordeal a perfect conversion for a heart-pounding screen drama.\n\nPost Malone: Runaway (2022)\n\nDirector: Hector Dockrill\n\nCast: Post Malone\n\nGenre: Documentary, Music\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 5m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: n/a\n\nFew young artists have shot to as lofty of heights in recent years as the undeniably talented Post Malone. Looking at his meteoric rise, Post Malone: Runaway uses the artist’s first U.S. stadium tour back in 2019 to get a better idea of what the journey has meant to the musician, and how it has affected both himself and his music. Masterfully crafted by director Hector Dockrill, Runaway steps back from the standard cookie-cutter approach of snippet interviews with fellow artists and stadium bites to allow Post a chance to give his own interpretation. Hearing his thoughts and feelings in real time (many captured mere moments after performing) creates for a fascinating evolution, as the artist’s growth isn’t just insinuated in hindsight but seen right there on screen. While many viewers of this doc will no doubt not have had the opportunity to attend the 2019 tour, Post Malone: Runaway imparts the thrill of having a backstage pass to each and every performance.\n\nLicorice Pizza (2021)\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCast: Cooper Hoffman, Alana Haim, Skyler Gisondo, Bradley Cooper, Sean Penn, John C. Reilly, Benny Safdie\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h 13m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 91% (Critics), 65% (Audience)\n\nProving his talent once again for oddball period pieces, Oscar-winning writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has set his sights on 1970s Los Angeles. 15-year-old Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman) has never been your average kid. 20-something Alana Kane (Alana Haim) on the other hand has always been utterly normal. Gravitating toward each other over the course of Gary’s get-rich-quick schemes and all the hijinks that ensue, vintage Hollywood, young love, and the oddities of 1970s suburban L.A. are explored. Simply calling Licorice Pizza a coming-of-age tale would be an oversimplification with its genre-defying storytelling too wide to pin down. Boasting career-launching performances from the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son, Cooper Hoffman, and Haim singer Alana Haim, as well as two contenders for performance of the year via Bradley Cooper and Sean Penn, Licorice Pizza doesn’t have to be specific to be great, though. It just has to be itself.\n\nLord of the Rings Trilogy + The Hobbit Trilogy\n\nDirector: Peter Jackson\n\nCast: Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Dominic Monaghan, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, Marton Csokas, Martin Freeman, Luke Evans, Richard Armitage, Lee Pace, Benedict Cumberbatch, Evangeline Lilly, Christopher Lee, Stephen Fry, Ed Sheeran, Karl Urban, Ian Holm\n\nGenre: Adventure, Fantasy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 91% (Critics), 95% (Audience)\n\nEmergency (2022)\n\nDirector: Carey Williams\n\nCast: RJ Cyler, Donald Elise Watkins, Sebastian Chacon, Sabrina Carpenter, Maddie Nichols\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 93% (Critics), 96% (Audience)\n\nA satirical party flick with as much brains as laughs, Emergency might be one of the best films to ever premiere on Prime. Determined to make the most out of their last year at college, friends/roommates Kunle (Donald Elise Watkins) and Sean (RJ Cyler) decide to attempt the “legendary tour” in which students must complete an entire evening of drinking at various locations. Going in with a game plan, the pair head back to their dorm to get ready. What they find when they arrive is an unconscious white girl. A bad look for anyone, it’s particularly troublesome for Kunle and Sean: two black men who’ve been drinking. Heading down a road of bad decisions, the two friends search for every possible way out of their predicament other than calling the police. Meanwhile, the girl’s friends are getting closer to finding them using a where’s-my-phone app. Guaranteed to keep you guessing and laughing the entire time, Emergency is not the type of film you want spoiled by word of mouth. And trust me, plenty of people are going to be talking about it.\n\nExperimenter (2015)\n\nDirector: Michael Almereyda\n\nCast: Peter Sarsgaard, Winona Ryder, Kellan Lutz, Jim Gaffigan, Anton Yelchin, John Leguizamo, Dennis Haysbert\n\nGenre: Drama, Biopic\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 38m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 85% (Critics), 61% (Audience)\n\nFew tests in the field of modern psychology have garnered as much attention as the still controversial Milgram Experiments. In 1961, Dr. Stanley Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard) took a group of volunteers to participate in a social psychology experiment at Yale University. Dr. Milgram told the participants to press a button. The effect of this button was that the participants heard a recording of someone undergoing extreme electric shock. Sickened, horrified, and outraged, the participants still did as they were told and pressed the button, fully believing they were the cause of the auditory pain. Experimenter aims to unravel the mystery that still is Dr. Stanley Milgram, who is revered as a genius by some, and called a monster by others. Undergoing a massive transformation from subtle mind to boisterous narcissist, Sarsgaard plays off his co-star Winona Ryder’s subtler performance, creating a film as layered and complex as the man it aims to explain.\n\nThe Fighter (2010)\n\nDirector: David O. Russell\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo\n\nGenre: Drama, Biopic\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 91% (Critics), 89% (Audience)\n\nChanneling boxing champion and fellow Beantown hero Micky Ward, Mark Wahlberg delivers a career-best performance in this thrilling biopic. Micky was never meant to be a champion. No, that was his older half-brother Dicky (Christian Bale). Dicky fought Sugar Ray. Dicky had style. Dicky had class. Now, Dicky only has a heroin addiction and a tendency to mismanage his brother Micky’s career. Deciding to give boxing one last go, Micky fires Dicky and his mother and sets out on his own. Piecing together a winning streak, Micky knows the only chance he has at becoming champ is if he brings his family back into the loop. For that to happen though, some big changes need to be made. Boasting knockout performances from the entire cast, and a story where the personal struggles hit harder than any boxing match, it’s plain to see why The Fighter garnered six Oscar nods and earned Christian Bale the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nHouse of Gucci (2021)\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nCast: Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons, Salma Hayek, Al Pacino\n\nGenre: Crime, Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 2h 37m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 63% (Critics), 83% (Audience)\n\nClueless (1995)\n\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\n\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Paul Rudd, Brittany Murphy, Stacey Dash, Donald Faison, Elisa Donovan\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 37m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 81% (Critics), 76% (Audience)\n\nThe movie that spawned the show, Clueless is far from what its title suggests. Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) is the official It girl of her Beverly Hills high school. Counting popularity to be synonymous with philanthropy, Cher sets out to prove her saintliness to ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) by taking on the socially inept new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), as her protégé. Shopping, boys, and sarcasm soon mold Tai into a near mirror image of Cher, only to have Cher realize she’s created a monster. Poking fun at the plethora of shallow teen dramas of the 1990s such as 90210, Clueless finds socially relevant lessons inside comedy, making it one of the smartest teen comedies of the decade, and one that still holds up today.\n\nJennifer’s Body (2009)\n\nDirector: Karyn Kusama\n\nCast: Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, Adam Brody, Chris Pratt, J.K. Simmons\n\nGenre: Horror, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 1h 42m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 45% (Critics), 35% (Audience)\n\nA B-movie full of future big names and more brains than budget, Jennifer’s Body is one of those cult classics people will be quoting for years. High school queen bee Jennifer (Megan Fox) has just been possessed by a demon and is now going around killing her fellow students. Tinted with a touch of feminism, this “high school is hell” analogy explores more serious themes than pimples such as consent, domestic violence, and gaslighting. While the underlying messages may be serious, this school horror never lets the learning get in the way of the fun. Playing with tropes like slut, jock, and nerdy girl, Juno writer Diablo Cody tears into the social structure we’re all taught throughout our academic years, while also realizing it’s probably too late for most of us so we might as well celebrate the little wins. It’s these funny, original, and creative little gains throughout Jennifer’s Body that make it such a big win for anybody smart enough to watch.\n\nThe Italian Job (2003)\n\nDirector: F. Gary Gray\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G, Donald Sutherland\n\nGenre: Crime, Thriller\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 1h 51m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 73% (Critics), 80% (Audience)\n\nDropping smack dab between Ocean’s Eleven and Ocean’s Twelve, this star-studded remake of the 1969 classic of the same name may have gotten lost in the crowd, but in no way deserves to stay there. After pulling off a once-in-a-lifetime heist of ancient gold bars, Steve (Edward Norton) turns on his partners, killing his teacher John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) and leaving the others to die. Focused on revenge more than even the money itself, crew leader Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), techie Lyle (Seth Green), and driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) re-team with the addition of Bridger’s daughter Stella (Charlize Theron). A mix of all the action movies at the time, The Italian Job mimics the elaborate heist setups from the Ocean’s series while blending in the pulse-pounding elements of the Jason Bourne franchise.

After five people end up dead in a small Midwest town, everyone points the blame at none other than ex-Army investigator and trained killer Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). Using his exceptional skill set to clear his name, Reacher sets out to discover who framed him and why. What he finds is a winding trail of corruption far too big for such a small town, leading him to an ending guaranteed to end badly for someone.

After young boxer Leo (Masataka Kubota) rescues drug-addled prostitute Yuri (Sakurako Konishi) from a pair of Yakuza thugs, the pair flee across nighttime Tokyo. Hyper-violent action scenes are interwoven with romance and cast against the spacey backdrop of endless neon signs and underground clubs, to create a movie that feels more like live-action anime (in a good way) than your run-of-the-mill gangster film. As always, Miike’s impeccable style blends visual with story, transporting the audience to a world that would make the Kill Bill franchise look dull. Buckle up, because First Love is one of the craziest films Prime has to offer.\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness (2013)\n\nDirector: J.J.

The year is 1984 and as far as Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) knows, she is what she’s always been—a regular L.A. girl. That all changes though when someone starts killing people with her same name. Picked up by police, Connor thought she’d be safe, but Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) soon explains that the killer hunting her down isn’t a person, but a robot (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from the future with one goal only—to terminate.\n\nSkyfall (2012)\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nCast: Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Bérénice Marlohe, Albert Finney, Judi Dench\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 2h 23m\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 92% (Critics), 86% (Audience)\n\nHands down the best Daniel Craig Bond movie, Skyfall sees 007 hang up his numbers only to rise out of the ashes and overcome his most personal battle yet.
