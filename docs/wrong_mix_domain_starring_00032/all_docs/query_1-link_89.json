        "text": "“It's ugly. When you have kids and you're getting a divorce, be very careful what you do,” Behar stated. “Those kids will be scarred and remember this forever.”\n\nThe panelists then addressed the lawsuit Turner filed on Thursday, September 21, which claimed the Jonas Brothers member “abducted” their two daughters.\n\n“It feels like they're using them as pawns here,” Hostin pointed out.\n\nGriffin chimed in to add that she believes Turner has been getting “mom shamed.”\n\n“As soon as it was announced, there was kind of a slander campaign frankly against Sophie Turner, someone who is an incredibly accomplished actress working on Game of Thrones since she was 18 [claiming she was] partying and doing this,” she said, referencing the many accusations that painted the actress out to be an irresponsible mother.\n\n“This is a person who is a mom to young kids, but also a very successful person. It kind of waded into some of the mom shaming that may be s--- shaming,” Griffin added. “This could get super dicey and could become an international custody battle.”\n\nAs OK! previously reported, Turner’s filing alleged that the musician would not return their daughters to their \"forever home\" in England following the couple’s split.\n\nThe legal paperwork claimed the kids were \"wrongfully retained in New York City\" beginning on September 20.\n\nAccording to the paperwork, the duo relocated to the U.K. in April of this year. “The parties were both excited for the family’s move to England,” it read.\n\nTurner then landed a job across the pond filming, while Jonas was on tour with his brothers Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas. They parents made the decision that the girls would stay with the Camp Rock star for the time being.\n\n“The children would then at least be able to spend some time during the day with one of their parents until the mother finished her filming commitments,” the legal paperwork said, noting it was a “temporary arrangement.”\n\nHowever, the couple’s relationship \"very suddenly\" crumbled, with Turner learning of their divorce \"through the media.\"\n\nJonas’ team also alleged that \"less than 24 hours later, Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the U.K. Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately.\"\n\n\"This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending,\" a statement continued. \"When language like ‘abduction’ is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst.\""
