Something this good I would have seen multiple times by now if it was any older than just a few days. I have to share it with others!’ Well imagine the stupid expression on my gobsmacked face when I found this incredible parody/homage to Tarantino’s Kill Bill shared on Reddit, and I followed it through to YouTube, only to see when it was released.
