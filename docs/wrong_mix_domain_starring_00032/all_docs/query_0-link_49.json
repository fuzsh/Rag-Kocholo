        "text": "If there’s any zodiac sign that was made to be a star it’s Leo, and it’s officially the start of their season.\n\nThey’re glamorous, a little bossy and enormously generous. Leos sometimes can seem intimidating because of their boundless courage and effortless charm. And while they are known for their diva-like personas, they won’t let just anyone see it. When you’re welcomed into their pride, they’ll be the your best person to vent to and the person you go to to get sound advice. But don’t cross them. It truly takes a lot to get under the fur of a Leo, as they’re usually minding their own business and staying in the lane that pays them. However, they won’t hesitate to crank that purr up to a roar if they feel threatened.\n\nThey don’t always seek to be in charge, they organically land in boss-type roles because of their natural leadership skills. Their love language is gifts, travel and attention, and they want anyone they love to give them that same type of love right back.\n\nThe Leo season is recognized from July 23 to Aug. 22.
