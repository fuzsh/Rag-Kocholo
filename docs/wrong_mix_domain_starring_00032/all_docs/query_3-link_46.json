        "text": "Good news for JoBros fans, they released a video last week announcing that they’re going to perform at MetLife Stadium as part of the NHL Stadium series on Feb. 17 before the Devils and Flyers face off.\n\nOne part of their video, however, gave me pause.\n\nThe oldest, Kevin, is the first to speak in the video they posted on the band’s Instagram: “We’re from Jersey… of course we don’t pump our own gas.”\n\nClassic Jersey.\n\nNext Joe Jonas delivers a line to the camera: “We’re from Jersey… of course, we’ve spent our summer vacations at the Jersey shore.”\n\nA New Jersey summer tradition!\n\nThen comes in Nick Jonas: “We’re from Jersey… of course, we call it Taylor Ham.”\n\n“It’s pork roll,” says an off-camera voice.\n\n“Shut up,” Nick responds.\n\nThis is where the video should have stopped dead with a record scratch sound effect.\n\nTaylor Ham….\n\nTaylor Ham?!?!\n\nThe nerve of these guys!\n\nI’ll give them that they’re from North Jersey (Wyckoff, to be specific), and that’s “we say Taylor Ham” territory, but they can’t speak for the entire state with this misguided statement.\n\nIt says right on the package that the beloved NJ breakfast meat is called “pork roll.”\n\nAs a born and raised Central-Jerseyan, I can't sit by and let them get away with trying to claim that everyone from the Garden State calls it \"Taylor Ham.\" Some of us know better.\n\nThe post above reflects the thoughts and observations of New Jersey 101.5's Kylie Moore. Any opinions expressed are Kylie's own. You can follow Kylie on Instagram."
