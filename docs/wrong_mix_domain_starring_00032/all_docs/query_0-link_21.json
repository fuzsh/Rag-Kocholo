        "text": "1. Nobody can figure out if Anne Hathaway had her baby\n\nSince Anne Hathaway announced she was pregnant in July, gossip columnists who apparently don't understand the broad strokes of a pregnancy timeline have wondered: When is that baby coming? Blessedly, we may finally have our answer. Several tabloids, which have eagerly been trying to sleuth out whether Hathaway quietly gave birth sometime last month, seem to have found a smoking gun: Hathaway and her husband Adam Shulman walking around in a park with an infant car seat, which is a weird thing to carry if you don't have an infant. Meanwhile, the rest of us non-weirdos can look forward to seeing Hathaway's new baby whenever she and her husband decide to announce it.\n\nPage Six\n\n2. Jack Black briefly forgot he starred in The Holiday\n\nWalking the red carpet is an undoubtedly bizarre experience, with dozens of flashbulbs going off in your face as someone you've never met asks \"Who are you wearing?\" or whatever. So you can forgive Jack Black for having a brain fart when asked about his favorite holiday movie. The actor waxed rhapsodic about Elf for a while before he was reminded that he actually starred in a holiday movie called… The Holiday. To be fair, Elf is pretty great!\n\nPeople\n\n3. It sounds like a third Kill Bill might be on the way\n\nOver the past 15 years, Quentin Tarantino has occasionally made noise about writing and directing another Kill Bill movie — which is a little tricky, since the second and final movie ended with the protagonist, uh, killing Bill. But in a recent interview, Tarantino said he's still very interested in revisiting The Bride one last time before his self-imposed retirement from filmmaking. He also revealed that he just had dinner with star Uma Thurman at a Japanese restaurant, which honestly sounds like a great opening scene for a third Kill Bill movie.\n\nPage Six\n\n4. Adam Sandler says he doesn't read reviews of his movies\n\nAdam Sandler is getting some of the best reviews of his career for the upcoming thriller Uncut Gems, with some critics arguing that an Oscar nomination might even be in the cards. But whatever people say about him, Sandler says he isn't interested, because he received so many bad reviews at the start of his career that he stopped reading them altogether. \"I just keep doing my thing,\" says Sandler — and when your thing is being paid millions of dollars to goof around with your buddies, why mess with success?\n\nYahoo Entertainment\n\n5. Now Disney is rebooting Home Alone\n\nQuick: How many Home Alone movies did they make? If you said \"five,\" you are correct (and you are also the only person in the world who remembers the last three of them). But faster than you can put your hands on your cheeks and yell, Disney is ramping up for a sixth Home Alone, which is bound for Disney+. Archie Yates, who broke out as Jojo's adorable best friend in Jojo Rabbit, is slated to star, with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Ellie Kemper and Catastrophe star Rob Delaney in supporting roles — because if Disney is really dead set on turning Home Alone into a full-fledged franchise, they might as well stack the deck with the most likable actors in the world."
