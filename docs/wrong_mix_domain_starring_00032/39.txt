Trivia[]

Tim Miller revealed that author Joe Abercrombie is heavily involved in the adaptation of the First Law novel series, writing the script for Best Served Cold.

The original plan was to film the First Law trilogy as three back-to-back movies, but they decided to start with Best Served Cold to introduce the story to a wider audience.

Miller describes the movie as a blend of Kill Bill and Game of Thrones, highlighting Abercrombie's unique writing style that combines dark humor and humanity.
