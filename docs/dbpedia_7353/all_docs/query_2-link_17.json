Sheldon Whitehouse presiding. Present: Senators Franken, Schumer, Feinstein, and Grassley. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND Senator Whitehouse. This hearing will come to order. We have a number of nominees for Federal court to consider today and we have a number of colleagues who are here to make introductions, and I will call on my colleagues in the following order. I'll start with Senator Baucus and Senator Feinstein, and then Senator Tester, then Senator Manchin, unless the Majority Leader comes, in which case he will be next. [Laughter.] Senator Whitehouse. Senator Baucus, would you care to proceed? PRESENATATION OF DANA CHRISTENSEN, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA BY HON. MAX BAUCUS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Baucus. Thank you very much, Senator. I appreciate it very much. I am very please here today to introduce Dana Christiansen as a nominee to serve as U.S. District Judge for the District of Montana. President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, ``The qualities of a great man are vision, integrity, courage, understanding, the power of articulation, and a profundity of character. One might also say these are qualities of a great Federal judge. These, too, are the qualities I consider when speaking of Dana Christiansen. It is a personal pleasure to be able to introduce Dana to this Committee. Dana will be introducing his family later in his testimony, but I would like to personally congratulate Dana and his wife Stephanie on this momentous occasion. Dana is a fourth-generation Montanan. He was raised in Missoula, Montana. He graduated from Stanford University in 1973, and then received his law degree from the University of Montana School of Law in 1976. Since graduating from law school, Dana has commended the respect of other bar members throughout the State of Montana. In 1998, Dana and two of his partners formed a new firm in Kalispell, Montana which specializes in civil defense, business law, real estate, and estate planning. Dana has tried more than 50 trials in State and Federal courts. He has an active mediation and arbitration practice and has represented many clients on a pro-bono basis. Both Dana and his firm have received the highest rankings from Chambers USA, and Dana has been ranked as one of the top 75 lawyers in the northwestern United States by Super Lawyers over the last decade. Dana is also a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates and American College of Trial Lawyers. I cannot say enough about Dana's ability and commitment to justice. Outside of the office, Dana is very active in his community. He has been a member of the board of directors of his local Chamber of Commerce, president of the Montana Defense Trial Lawyers Association, a member of the University of Montana School of Law Board of Visitors, and a member of the faculty of the University of Montana Advanced Trial Advocacy Program. To ensure that the most ethical and qualified attorney is appointed as District Judge, I created an advisory selection panel made up of five members with diverse legal backgrounds from across our State and across party lines. My colleague, Senator Tester, very aggressively helped me in that endeavor. The panel was charged with recommending an individual with a breath of legal experience, ethics above reproach, sharp analytical skills, superior writing skills, and respect for precedent. The panel unanimously and enthusiastically recommended the nomination of Dana Christiansen. Clearly, Dana has earned respect from all segments of the Montana legal community and I am certain that his experience, leadership, and prudent will serve Montana as well. Dana embodies those qualities President Eisenhower articulated and the qualities that Montana, and America, need on the Federal bench: intellect, extensive experience in the courtroom, commitment to public service, integrity, and respect for precedent and the rule of law. I must say as an aside, Mr. Chairman, I can think of nobody in the State of Montana, or anybody else I have ever had the pleasure to meet, who will do a better job in serving our country, especially as a Federal judge, than Dana Christiansen. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Baucus. That is high praise, indeed, and of particular weight coming from you. I will now turn to Senator Feinstein. PRESENATION OF CATHY BENCIVENCO, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA BY HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased today to indicate my strong support for Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo, whom I recommended to the President for nomination to become a District Judge in the Southern District of California. Judge Bencivengo has been a U.S. Magistrate Judge in San Diego for the last 6 years. In that time she has earned an outstanding reputation among her colleagues on the bench and among the lawyers who appear in her courtroom. She was recommended to me by a bipartisan judicial screening Committee which I have established in California, and this Committee reviews judicial candidates based on their legal skill, reputation, experience, temperament, and overall commitment to excellence. Throughout the Committee process Judge Bencivengo set herself apart as a person who would be a truly exceptional addition to the District Court. She is a descendant of immigrants who came to California through Ellis Island at the turn of the 20th century. She was born in Teaneck, New Jersey. She wanted to be in public service from an early age. Her father was involved in local politics and her upbringing instilled in her a desire to serve the public. She began her undergraduate career at Rutgers in New Jersey, where she earned her Bachelor's degree in Journalism and Political Science in 1980. The following year she earned her Master's degree from Rutgers. From 1981 to 1984, she worked for a major American corporation, Johnson & Johnson, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. She then attended the University of Michigan Law School, where she excelled, graduated magna cum laude, and was inducted into the Order of the Coif. After law school she moved to San Diego, where she joined the San Diego-based firm, Grey Carey, which later became part of a major international law firm, DLA Piper, LLP. Soon after starting work as an associate, she became a founding member of the firm's Patent Litigation Group. Her knowledge of patent law, which she honed in law school and private practice, makes her a valued resource for colleagues and clients. She quickly rose through the ranks of her firm. In 2005 she was selected as the national co-chair of her firm's Patent Litigation Group, a role for which she managed a group of 70 patent attorneys--which, if you know patent attorneys, is a job in itself--around the country. Judge Bencivengo also worked to protect one of the mainstays of American children's literature, Dr. Seuss, as the lead partner on trademark and copyright issues for Dr. Seuss Enterprises. In 2005, she became a Magistrate Judge, where she served as a thoughtful jurist. Since her appointment, she has issued roughly 178 published opinions, over 190 reports and recommendations, and over 1,800 orders on non-dispositive motions. Nearly 800 of those orders involved felony criminal cases. A premier San Diego criminal defense attorney described her as ``seasoned, bright, responsive, fair, hardworking, and reflective''. I think that pretty much does it. In addition, her substantial expertise in patent law will be welcomed in the Southern District, which is part of a new Federal judicial program designed to assign more patent cases to judges who are experts in the field of patent law. In short, Judge Bencivengo will make a fine addition to the U.S. District Court, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Baucus. Mr. Chairman, if I might be excused. I have a matter I must urgently attend to. Senator Whitehouse. Of course. Of course. Senator Baucus. But I urge you to report out---- Senator Whitehouse. You were here with all of your--Senator Baucus. Senator Baucus [continuing]. Dana Christiansen very quickly. Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. Since we're going by seniority and since Senator Schumer has now arrived, let me call on Senator Schumer. Of course, everyone is free to go on about their business once they've concluded their statements. PRESENTATION OF MARGO BRODIE, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK BY HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Senator Schumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be very brief. I want to thank you for the opportunity to introduce yet another gifted New Yorker to this Committee. Margo Brodie has been nominated by the President to serve on the Eastern District of New York. I was pleased and proud to recommend her for this position as someone who has chosen to make her home in this country, and specifically in the neighborhood served by this court, and who has already graced her community with outstanding and dedicated service. Ms. Brodie was born in St. John's Antigua. She and her brother Euan were raised by a single mother with the help of her mother's parents and siblings. After graduating from high school at the age of 16, she attended St. Francis College in Brooklyn. She worked full-time, graduated magna cum laude, went on to the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where, in addition to work and her academic achievements, she dedicated herself to improving Pen's minority student recruitment. After graduating from law school, Ms. Brodie worked for the New York City Law Department for 3 years, where she learned how to litigate cases. She spent 5 years at Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, founded in 1854 and known for alums who include Franklin D. Roosevelt. Ms. Brodie returned to public service in 1999 by joining the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District, one of the preeminent U.S. Attorney's Offices in the Nation and one of the largest. She rose to become Deputy Chief and then Chief of the General Crimes Unit, where she trained more than half of the current AUSAs in the Eastern District. Since July 2010, she's been the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division, supervision all 100-plus criminal AUSAs in cases involving public corruption, civil rights, business and security fraud, terrorism, or organized crime, narcotics, and many other areas. She has also lent her considerable talents to training prosecutors and law enforcement officers on the rule of law in developing countries, and spent 10 years in Nigeria as a legal advisor on behalf of DOJ's Overseas Training Program. There is one other part of her lift story, perhaps the most important, that I wanted to highlight in conclusion. In 1996, Ms. Brodie became a citizen of the United States in the very courthouse where she would serve as a judge. I can't think of a more fitting candidate to serve the people in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island and all the communities in between than someone who pledged her allegiance to this country just footsteps from where she will decide cases. I look forward to Ms. Brodie's hearing and her continued service to this country and welcome her mother, her brother, as well as the Antiguan ambassador, Ms. Lovell, who is here to endorse her candidacy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank my colleagues. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Schumer. The Chair now recognizes Senator Jon Tester. PRESENTATION OF DANA CHRISTIANSEN, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA BY HON. JON TESTER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MONTANA Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I very much appreciate the opportunity to turn our focus back on a fellow by the name of Dana Christiansen, whom Max talked to eloquently about. Max covered most of the bases on Dana, and I guess-- doesn't it make you feel uncomfortable when people are saying nice things about you, Dana? But when I came in here, Senator Manchin says, gee, it takes two of you? I said, here's my point: this guy has got such a great resume, yes, it does take two of us. The fact is, Dana is a great guy. You know, you guys on the Judiciary Committee have to sit down and make a decision on somebody that you probably don't know a large portion of the time, and that's unfortunate in this particular case because Dana Christiansen is such a quality human being. Senator Grassley will appreciate this. This guy was an Eagle Scout and a millworker. He knows how to work with his hands. You've got to appreciate somebody who's going to be in a Federal judge position that not only has integrity and knows fairness, but knows how to work hard, and not only work with his head, but work with his hands. It will help a lot. Plus, he exhibits a level of common sense that, quite frankly, we can all be proud of. I hope Dana comes out of here and moves forward and we can get it through the Senate, because quite frankly he deserves Senate confirmation. This is a quality man who has got an impeccable record on what he's done in his life. He deserves our report. He is right for this job and good people deserve good things to happen to them. He is the right man for this job. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Reid, would you like to be recognized and introduce your nominee? I'm sure Senator Manchin will be happy to allow you priority. PRESENTATION OF EVAN WALLACH, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT BY HON. HARRY REID, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Reid. We just had our caucus, as you know. I have to always do my once-a-week press event. Evan Wallach is really a good man and has been a tremendous judge. I think he's a perfect nominee for the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. He is also a scholar, and I don't use that term flippantly. He's graduated from the University of Arizona and got his law degree from Berkeley, but that one law degree obviously wasn't enough. He went and got a graduate degree at Cambridge in England. By the way, he was a partner in a law firm when he did that, took a leave of absence to go get that degree. He is also a patriot. Again, I don't use that term loosely. As a boy, guided by the patriotism taught to him by his mom, dad, and his two older brothers, he is a 115-pound man--nothing wrong with small people. I have lots of them in my family--he volunteered for the military and went to Vietnam, carried a rifle, and did all the other things that happened during that brutal war. He and his two older brothers, as I indicated, volunteered to serve in Vietnam. He was awarded a Bronze Star. Evan Wallach served his country in Vietnam. When he was a partner in a law firm, very, very busy, the first Iraq war broke out. He quite his job on a temporary basis, came back, and again reentered the military, served in the Pentagon for many months. Took a leave of absence from his law practice and served as an active-duty attorney. He served in the office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army at the Pentagon station at the Pentagon. He really is a patriot. He served his country bravely in war, he has served his country well as a judge in the U.S. Court of International Trade. He has written hundreds of opinions as a judge on the Court of International Trade. He has also served as a circuit judge in the second, third, and ninth circuits, and a district court judge in Nevada, New York, and the District of Columbia. Because so much of his responsibility will be what we do with the new patent law, one of the cases he heard in Nevada is a patent case. I introduce my friend to all of you, but also say that--and I don't want to be overly rambunctious here and I hope this doesn't hurt him, but he's my friend. He is one of the best friends I've ever had. I think the world of this man. I recommended him to President Clinton to leave this lucrative law practice to go into public service, and he did that. He is someone who I admire do greatly. He is a poet. He writes poetry. His mom was a wonderful artist, who just died. I have some of her paintings and etchings in my home in Nevada. I wish I had the ability to convey to this Committee what a wonderful human being he is and how fortunate we are as a country that he would be willing to not see how much money he can make, but he's decided instead to see what a difference he can make in public service. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Leader Reid. Senator Reid. Could I be excused? Senator Whitehouse. You certainly may. Senator Reid. Thank you all very much. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Manchin? The patient Senator Manchin. PRESENTATION OF GINA MARIE GROH, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA BY HON. JOE MANCHIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA Senator Manchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to all the members of the Judiciary Committee. I am greatly honored to be able to join you today to introduce an exemplary candidate for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, and someone who has become truly a dear friend of mine, Judge Gina Marie Groh. I want you to know that I really appreciate the opportunity to be here to speak to Judge Groh's exemplary experience and contributions to public service. First, I would like to thank Senator Jay Rockefeller for recommending Judge Groh for this prestigious position, and for his stead fast support of her nomination. I know that he has been instrumental in promoting Judge Groh's impressive background here in Washington, and I am truly grateful for his efforts. I would also like to recognize Judge Groh's husband, Steve Groh. Steve is with us today and her sons, 12-year-old Stephen and 6-year-old Michael--raise your hands, boys--and other members of our family who are also here. Now, I'm delighted that all of them were able to attend. Judge Groh is a well-respected and recognized member of her community in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. As I have known her for many years, as West Virginia's Governor I had the privilege of appointing Judge Groh to her current position as the Circuit Judge of the Twenty-third Judicial Circuit in 2006. Judge Groh was recommended to me by a bipartisan merit selection Committee made up of the most notable figures in West Virginia, legal and business community, including the president of the West Virginia State bar, the dean of the WVU's law school, former Senator Carr Goodwin, and other distinguished representatives in the State. Judge Groh's in-depth knowledge of the courtroom and excellent reputation with the State bar made her a stand-out candidate, and she was selected as the committee's overwhelming consensus choice for the Circuit Court appointment. Judge Groh was also the first female Circuit judge to serve in the eastern panhandle, and one of only six female Circuit Court judges in the entire State of West Virginia. Prior to her Circuit Court appointment, Judge Groh served as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney at the Prosecuting Attorney's Office in Berkley County and Jefferson County, West Virginia. During her 8 years as prosecutor, she established a strong record of protecting her fellow West Virginians by tirelessly pursuing convictions for such crimes as murder, robbery, rape, child abuse, drunk driving, and drug-related offenses. Judge Groh has not only excelled professionally, but she has also risen to become a true pillar of her community in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. She dedicates her time to countless charitable foundations and serves on a number of boards. For many years she has worked for such programs as Robes to School and the Mills with Love Ministry, and has been very involved with her alma mater, Shepherd University, serving both with the Wellness Center and as a member of the Alumni Board. These are really only a few examples of her extensive contribution to the area for which I am personally very grateful. Judge Groh graduated summa cum laude from Shepherd University in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree. She earned the university's highest academic honor as a McMurran Scholar. In addition to serving as editor-in-chief of the newspaper and vice president of her graduating class, Judge Groh went on to earn her J.D. from the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown, West Virginia. I believe that Judge Groh's experience, intellect, leadership, and impartiality and deep roots in the community make her a prudent choice for the vacancy in the Northern District of West Virginia. If appointed, she will be the first resident of the eastern panhandle to sit as a U.S. District judge in Martinsburg. Her extensive legal experience and dedication to public service demonstrate that she exemplifies not only the qualities of a talented jurist, but also the high moral character and sense of justice necessary to make a great judge. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today on Judge Groh's nomination and allowing me the opportunity to speak to her abilities. Along with Senator Rockefeller, I wholeheartedly support Judge Groh's nomination and I look forward to working with you to confirm her to the Federal bench as swiftly as possible. Thank you, sir. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Manchin. I know you have important business elsewhere and you may also be excused. We do have a statement from your senior Senator, Senator Rockefeller, who could not be here today. I will not read the entire statement, but he does say that ``this is a very important nomination for the people of West Virginia and deeply personal to me'', and describes the candidate as a ``supremely talented lawyer, a meticulous student of the law, a proven leader in her community, and a West Virginian through and through.'' So without objection his entire statement will be added to the record of these proceedings. [The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Whitehouse. I will now have the privilege of yielding to the Ranking Member to make a brief opening statement, and after that we will have Judge Wallach as the first panel, then the four District nominees as the second panel. STATEMENT OF CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. And it will be very brief. I'll put the entirety of my statement in the record. But I want to welcome all the nominees and their families and friends, and to say that we're moving along on confirmation of nominees. This week we confirmed another nominee on the Senate floor for the Federal Judiciary. We have now confirmed 34 nominees this Congress. We have taken positive action in one way or another on 78 percent of the judicial nominees that have been submitted by the President during this Congress, so we continue to move forward as I indicated I would do on the consensus nominees. It looks to me like we have a group that fall into that category this time. I'll put the rest of the statement in the record. [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Whitehouse. Very well. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Could Judge Wallach please come forward and remain standing? [Whereupon, the witness was duly sworn.] Senator Whitehouse. Please be seated. Welcome. Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. Senator Whitehouse. It is the custom of the Committee to allow for a brief statement by the nominee, and in particular for the nominee to take the occasion to recognize family and friends whom he or she may wish to recognize at this point in these proceedings. STATEMENT OF EVAN WALLACH, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. I'd like to introduce my wife, Dr. Katherine Tobin, who's sitting behind me, who has her Ph.D from Stanford University. She's a very smart person, but her distinction to me is she's the nicest person I've ever met. I've also got my friend David Olive here, a former client. My friends, Frank and Judy Stearns, I did their wedding. Frank just came back from Afghanistan a couple of weeks ago. I'd like to thank some folks, if I may, please, Senator. Senator Whitehouse. Please. Judge Wallach. I'd like to thank, first off, the members of this Committee and the staff who I know work very hard preparing for these kinds of hearings, and all the folks who helped me in this process, the people from the DOJ, the FBI, and the ABA, and the AO. All of them do an awful lot of work and I think they don't get recognized for what they do. Of course, some of my family is watching this from one place or another. I never met KT's dad. He was a career Naval aviator who died when she was a little girl. But he obviously influenced her. And I met her mom, whom I love dearly. Both her parents passed, and both mine have passed. As Senator Reid said, my mom was an artist and she just passed in May. My dad was an engineer. You know, on my birth certificate-- the Senator mentioned millwork on my birth certificate. It says my dad's occupation is millworker, and that was true, he was. But he was also working the graveyard shift while he attended the university at night. He went on to get an honorary doctorate from the University of Arizona. But that wasn't what he was about. He taught me a large thing in life--he taught all three of us boys--and that was to try and figure out what the right thing to do was, and then to do it. My oldest brother was, I think if you know the term, 4F. He was physically unqualified to serve in the Armed Forces. In Vietnam, a lot of people considered that a blessing. He went as a civilian employee and served 4 years over there. His wife Susan went as well and worked for the army. My middle brother enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and he did a full tour where he was the sole survivor from his unit once, came back, served 30 days in the United States, and went back to Vietnam, where he stepped on a mine and he was one of two survivors the second time. He came back here and got his Ph.D in Engineering, despite the fact that he is 100 percent disabled. He held several patents in the space industry. I'm very proud of them and I know they're watching, as I said, from one place or another. Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Judge Wallach. Could you just briefly describe the nature of your work on the Court of International Trade and how you think that prepares you and compares to the work you'll be asked to do as a U.S. Court of Appeals judge? Judge Wallach. Sure. We sit, Senator, as both trial judges in matters like Customs and in administrative appeals, in effect, in trade matters. One is regulated by the Chevron doctrine, the other is heard as a new case, sometimes with juries. And it's obviously specialized work, but the essence of it is the same as any law. That is, a judge should look at it, try to know the background, read what record you have in front of you, and learn the law and be prepared for a hearing. I think I've sat on some appellate benches and I think it's the same on an appellate bench as it is a trial bench. Senator Whitehouse. Well, I'm very impressed at the legacy of service that you bring to this appointment, and I wish you a speedy confirmation. I will turn over to our Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, then to Senator Franken. Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. Senator Grassley. Let me say something before I ask some questions. It may sound like I'm trying to get you or something on an issue that is very personal to me from a policy standpoint, and I'm not trying to do that at all. But I'm trying to bring attention to your court and you'll probably be a member of that court, and maybe you can help this court be a little more reasonable in an area where I don't think they've been very reasonable. So, I've got some questions along that line. Congress has consistently recognized the value of whistleblowers in government and private sector. I was an original co-sponsor of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, and I've always pushed for strong whistleblower protections for Federal employees. I think that most of my oversight work comes from one or two areas, either good, substantial evidence that I get from whistleblowers or from enterprising investigative journalism. So whistleblowers, I think, are a very important part in, is government going to be responsible and transparent and accountable and all that? The Federal Circuit has issued a number of decisions that have substantially limited the type of disclosures that are protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act, and I wouldn't expect you to be acquainted with these statistics, but up until February 2011 only 3 out of 219 cases that whistleblowers have brought for appeal has a whistleblower won. Three out of 219. Last year, the court was zero for nine against whistleblowers. Perhaps the most egregious example of the Federal Circuit placing hurdles in front of the Federal Government whisteblowers is a 1999 decision, LaChance v. White. In that case the Federal Circuit held that a whistleblower had to present ``irrefragable'' proof that wronging actually occurred in order to provide a claim. So my questions are kind of along the lines of what maybe you think about or we can think about bringing some reasoning to these figures that I just gave you. I mean, I would expect that not every whistleblower appeal would be in favor of the whistleblower. In fact, maybe a minority would be in favor of the whistleblower. But in the case of these statistics I gave you, you can see how overwhelmingly it is against it. Now, maybe you can blame those of us that wrote the 1989 law for not giving enough protection or enough direction to the court. So my first question is, considering that the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, so you're the only one that's going to hear them. What, if any, experience do you have with the Whistleblower Protection Act? If you say none that's OK, but I just have to ask the question. Judge Wallach. Senator, thank you. Thank you for that question. I know about your work with whistleblowers and NIGs. I can't say I have any direct experience at all. I just say that in journalism, I used to argue a lot that the phrase ``consent of the governed'' always had to mean informed consent when I argued to a court. It's vital that government and the people be kept informed, and obviously whistleblowers have something to do with that. Senator Grassley. Yes. Have you ever heard of the irrefragable proof standard? If so, what's your understanding of that standard? Judge Wallach. My understanding of it is, Senator, that it means that it cannot be refuted, that it's irrefutable proof. It's a very high standard. Senator Grassley. OK. So then I suppose the next question is, what does a whistleblower need to prove under that standard to meet it? Judge Wallach. Senator, I don't know the answer to that. Obviously I'd look at the case authority and the statute to try to determine it in each case. Senator Grassley. OK. Can I ask you whether or not you believe that the irrefragable proof standard or a substantial evidence standard should apply to whistleblower cases? Because, you know, the irrefragable one is a judicial standard, not in the law. Judge Wallach. Like everything, Senator, I would be bound by stare decisis. I'd have to look at it, but principle decisionmaking requires me to say that. Senator Grassley. Wouldn't stare decisis, though, make it almost impossible under that standard to ever improve these statistics I just gave you? Judge Wallach. It might be, Senator, that the Supreme Court or obviously the national legislature might be taking a look at it if the courts are wrong. That happens. Senator Grassley. Well, I would give you this opportunity. Would you be willing to put in writing your understanding of the irrefragable proof standard and whether or not you agree with this standard for reviewing decisions of the Merit System Protection Board? Judge Wallach. Sure. I'd be delighted to, Senator. Senator Grassley. I would like to have you--since this is a very unique body you're going to, I'd like to ask you any experience you've had, if any--and emphasis upon if any, because maybe you haven't where you have served in the past-- but would you please identify what experiences you have had that would come before this court in these four areas: patent law, trade law, government contracts, and claims against the government. Judge Wallach. Well, in trade, Senator--thank you. Obviously I've sat for 16 years and so I've learned something in that time, and I like to think I know a bit about it. In patent, as Senator Reid said, I sat on a case. I did some IP, intellectual property, work for my press clients, but it was more along the lines of trademark. I've taught overseas for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, teaching foreign judges intellectual property. Senator Grassley. OK. Then beyond what you just said that you've had, if confirmed would you feel a need to prepare yourself in any way to handle these cases, and how would you do that? Judge Wallach. Absolutely I'd feel the need, Senator. I would obviously--I'd try to educate myself, so I'd read the law first, the governing authorities from my superior court, the Supreme Court, and from the prior cases of the Court of Appeals, as well as any other cases coming up from other courts that might inform me. Senator Grassley. I'd like to--the last series of questions would deal with any political activity you've had, and they aren't asked to denigrate any activity or say it's wrong, or that it would have undue influence. But I feel it necessary to ask, because prior to being appointed as a judge on the International Trade Court, you were actively involved in Nevada politics. You worked on Democratic campaigns as the counsel for the State's Democratic party. There's certainly nothing wrong with that, but your political history may concern future litigants after you're confirmed. Could you provide the Committee an example of a case you decided as a judge on the Court of International Trade where you put your political views aside to make an independent, sound legal judgment? And I'm not insinuating that politics would enter into your decision, but if there's any case where there was conflict, that maybe you could show where you put it aside. Judge Wallach. Senator, thank you for asking that, but I never saw anything where I thought there was a political aspect to it. There were probably some cases where I walked into it feeling one way and the lawyers convinced me the other way, but that was a question of how the law was going, not politics. Senator Grassley. Well, then I think you'll satisfy me with one last question. I think the answer is probably very obvious, how you've held your demeanor here at this meeting. I'm sure you can assure the Committee then, if confirmed, your decisions will remain grounded in precedent and the text of the law. You said that in the case of the whistleblower cases, but in addition to all other cases rather than any underlying political ideology or motivation. Judge Wallach. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Judge Wallach. Thank you, sir. Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Franken. Senator Franken. Thank you, Judge, for testifying. Congratulations on your nomination. Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. Senator Franken. Thank you for your service and for your family's service. I'm interested actually in the International Court of Trade because I don't know much about it. What kind of stuff comes before you? In other words, are you judging whether a country is violating trade laws or a segment of an industry and the country that's doing that? What kind of stuff? Can you give me some examples? Judge Wallach. Yes, sir. It's not so much a country, although once in a while you have a national entity appear in front of you. But it's several things. First, we do antidumping and countervailing duty cases. We are a National Geographic court with limited subject matter jurisdiction. Senator Franken. I don't know what that means, a National Geographic court. What does that mean? Judge Wallach. So we hear any case in the United States that comes from anywhere in the U.S., as long as it falls within our limited area of jurisdiction of law. So that, for example, a claim by the U.S. industry that a foreign company is selling goods for less than the fair market value, in effect antitrust law, that foreign company is trying to capture the market in the United States by undercutting, will be investigated by U.S. Government entities. They're going to rule one way or the other for somebody, and somebody is not going to like it. Whoever it is who doesn't like that ruling takes it up to us. That's why I said before we sit in that area, in effect, in an administrative appellate review. Senator Franken. I see. Judge Wallach. We also do Customs cases. Those are brand- new ones where somebody imports something into the country and they're saying one of two things, either Customs said it was one thing and it's really something different so we should pay a different tariff, or we agree what it is, but Customs says it's worth a whole bunch more money than we think it's worth, so you're imposing a much higher value on it and, as a consequence, a higher duty. And so they come in and they actually have trials about that. Senator Franken. OK. So you're an appellate court on trade matters. Judge Wallach. Yes, sir. Senator Franken. And what happens? Can they appeal higher than you? Judge Wallach. Yes, sir. Senator Franken. Where do they go then? Judge Wallach. They come to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It's our appellate court. Senator Franken. OK. So if some--China, say, is dumping a certain kind of finished paper product, that might be something that you would hear? Judge Wallach. We would hear a case involving a Chinese company. I have heard such cases. Senator Franken. OK. Then you decide and then it goes to an appellate court. Judge Wallach. If a party doesn't like it, they take it up to the court for which I'm nominated. Senator Franken. OK. And then if they don't like that, where do they go? Judge Wallach. The Supreme Court, sir. Senator Franken. OK. And how often do those kind of things go to the Supreme Court? Judge Wallach. Not often that they actually grant a writ of certiorari, but it happens occasionally. Senator Franken. OK. And so China has to abide by it since it's shipping into the United States? Judge Wallach. That's correct. In effect, what happens is, there's a tariff imposed. So as the goods come in, that money is going to have to be paid. Senator Franken. So there's no international trade adjudicator on trade agreements? Judge Wallach. Well, there's the World Trade Organization. Senator Franken. Yes. Where does that fit into this process? Judge Wallach. We pay no homage to the WTO. We are purely a U.S. court and we follow the U.S. law and what the Congress tells us to do. Senator Franken. So you don't have to pay homage to them? Judge Wallach. We don't have to. Senator Franken. I think that's good. Judge Wallach. We don't kiss rings or anything. Senator Franken. But I meant, it seems to me then--I just want to get this clear. Are there--who has jurisdiction sometimes? Is there a question whether you have jurisdiction or the World Trade Organization has jurisdiction? Judge Wallach. No, sir. We would have jurisdiction over a case. It might well be that they're hearing the same issue over in their appellate panels and they might decide it totally differently. Senator Franken. Well, who wins, then? Judge Wallach. Well, as far as we're concerned, as far as the U.S. courts are concerned and the U.S. Government, our rulings are rulings in the United States and they apply. If a WTO decision is contrary, it might be that they give the litigants the ability to enter sanctions on an international basis, apply tariffs or something along those lines. But it really has nothing to do with us as a court. Senator Franken. I'm just trying to think of who has the ultimate authority. Judge Wallach. As far as we're concerned, the Supreme Court of the United States, and that's it. Senator Franken. OK. But if you're in conflict with the WTO it's not like you're calling Ban Ki-moon or something. Judge Wallach. No, sir. Senator Franken. OK. OK. Well, that's good. I just wanted to learn a little bit. It's not that often in these things that I learn about something in this way. Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. That's very kind of you say. Senator Franken. I'd like to learn more sometime. Thank you. Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. Senator Whitehouse. Judge Wallach, I wish you well as you go through the confirmation process under the leadership of Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley. We have moved fairly smoothly through the nominees here at the Committee level; the floor is a different question. There tends to be a considerable back-up there, so don't be discouraged that you get through the Committee and then there are delays on the floor. But I think you've been a very impressive nominee and I hope that you can see to rapid progress for your nomination through both of the obstacles that are ahead of you in the Senate. I wish you well, and thank you for being here. I appreciate that your family and friends have attended. Judge Wallach. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Grassley, as well. Senator Grassley. You bet. Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. Can we now call up Dana Christiansen, Cathy Bencivengo, Gina Groh, and Margo Brodie? We'll take a 2- minute break while everybody gets to chairs and signs sorted out. [Pause] [The biographical information follows.] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Whitehouse. All right. I welcome each of the nominees who are here today. I congratulate you on the recommendation by my colleagues and your selection by the President of the United States as a candidate for a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Judiciary. I'm delighted that you have brought family and friends with you. I think we'll just go right across the table, from my left to my right. We'll start with Dana Christensen. If you would care to make any kind of an opening statement, Mr. Christensen, and recognize any family or friends or any expressions of appreciation you'd care to make, now is the time. STATEMENT OF DANA CHRISTENSEN, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA Mr. Christensen. Thank you, Senator. I want to thank this Committee for the privilege of this hearing. I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Tester for those very kind introductions. Obviously I'd like to thank the President for the honor of this nomination. If I am confirmed by this Senate and sworn in, I understand that I will be the 17th Article 3 Federal judge in the history of the State of Montana, which is a very significant privilege and honor. I have a small family, but a very close one. With me here today is my wife Stephanie. I met her 41 years ago when we were sophomores at Stanford University, and we spent last weekend celebrating our 37th wedding anniversary backpacking for three days and two nights along the Highline Trail in Glacier National Park. If Senators Baucus and Tester were still here, they could attest to the fact that that's one of the most beautiful places in the world. I also have with me here today my brother-in-law, Jack Adalaar, who is a lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia and an avid and very well-informed student of American government and American politics. Watching on webcast either live or this evening is my 32- year-old daughter, who is a special education teacher in Seattle. She and her fiance Josh live there, and she's currently with her 5th grade students. My 29-year-old son and his wife Anya live in San Francisco and he works for a small venture capital company in Palo Alto. I have obviously a number of other family members and very close friends: my law partners for many years, the wonderful folks that work in my office that are all watching this, presumably live, and I want to thank you again for this opportunity. [The biographical information follows.] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Mr. Christensen. Judge Bencivengo, welcome. STATEMENT OF CATHY ANN BENCIVENGO, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA Judge Bencivengo Thank you, Senator. I'd like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to be here today. I'd like to thank Senator Feinstein and her judicial selection committee for sponsoring my nomination, and I'd certainly like to thank the President for my nomination. I have with me here today my husband, and I thank him for his unfailing support for our now going on 28 years of marriage. My children were unable to be here; they're both attending classes in college. But I would like to recognize them--I believe they're watching on the webcast: my daughter Dana, who is a senior at Colorado State, and my daughter Lauren, who is a freshman at Miami University of Ohio. With me I do have here today some friends. One of my dearest and oldest friends, Tracy Horner Bird, who I've known since first grade, and her husband Maitland, her daughter Skye and her friend Ian Faulk, and a friend and former colleague from my old law firm, DLA, Kathryn Riley Grasso. I'd like to thank all my friends and family who are, I hope, watching on the webcast, and particularly my colleagues back at the Southern District of California, my fellow Magistrate judges, and for all the support they've given me, and my wonderful staff, chambers, and my courtroom deputy who I know are watching. Thank you. [The biographical information follows.] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Whitehouse. Thank you very much. Judge Groh. STATEMENT OF GINA MARIE GROH, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA Judge. Groh. Thank you. Good afternoon, Senators. Thank you for inviting me here to answer your questions this afternoon. I'd like to thank the President for this nomination. I'd also like to thank Senator Rockefeller for recommending me to the Federal District Court, and thank Senator Manchin for heartily seconding that recommendation. Also, thank both of our Senators from West Virginia for their kind words here today. I have some folks with me. As Senator Manchin mentioned, I have my husband Steve, who is a great support to me, and my high school sweetheart; my sons Stephen and Michael. And I have some friends and colleagues here to offer support as well: my good friend Dr. Diana Noon, Magistrate Gail Boober, Ken Martin or Clarence Martin, who also served on that Merit Selection Committee that recommended me to then-Governor Manchin for appointment to the State bench, and Stephen Skinner. Back home watching on webcast that my court reporter, law clerk and secretary set up in my courtroom, we have my little 84-year-old mother, Elizabeth Householder, my sister Linda Gildersly, my brother, who's also a Vietnam vet, is watching from his home State up in New Jersey today. Thank you. [The biographical information follows.] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Judge Groh. Finally, Ms. Brodie. STATEMENT OF MARGO BRODIE, NOMINEE TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK Ms. Brodie. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Thank you to the Committee, also to Senator Schumer for his kind words today, and also for recommending me to the President. Thank you to the President for nominating me for this position. I have with me today my mother Nina Brodie, my brother Euan Brown, my cousin Jan Edwards, my aunt and uncle Barbara and Charles Brodie, and several friends and colleagues, both here in DC and who are watching on the webcast from New York. Also, friends who are watching from Antigua and from Nigeria. Thank you. [The biographical information follows.] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Whitehouse. I have the privilege now of turning to our Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, if you have any questions. Senator Grassley. I have one question for each and will probably submit some questions for answer in writing. Mr. Christiansen, according to your Senate questionnaire, nearly all of your litigation experience has involved civil matters with a focus on defending medical malpractice cases. Given your expertise in health care litigation, I'm interested in your view on one aspect of health care. It's not so much to get your opinion of what you might do as a judge, but from your practice. What impact would caps on damages have in our health care costs? Mr. Christiansen. Thank you, Senator Grassley. In Montana we have implemented over the years a number of things that would probably fairly be described as reform in the area of medical malpractice litigation. For instance, we have a $250,000 general damage cap in Montana. It's been on the books for a considerable period of time, since the mid-80s, I believe. We have a screening panel in Montana that requires parties, before they can file a lawsuit against a health care provider, to present a claim. It's non-binding, it's confidential. We also have a number of other statutes we've implemented in this area. Obviously I think it's important that the rights of parties to present their claims and to have access to the courts is essential. We haven't found that any of the things that we've done in Montana have severely limited those rights, and it's been my belief that all of these things have facilitated resolution, quite frankly, of claims against health care providers, particularly the medical/legal panel proceeding. I would estimate that probably 60, 70 percent of claims against health care providers get resolved as a result of that process. Senator Grassley. So it sounds to me like your conclusion is that the caps on damages would impact positively health care costs? Mr. Christiansen. Senator, I think I probably need to be careful in terms of how I respond to the issue of caps. Obviously I've lived with them. I will tell you that the constitutionality of that statute has never been addressed by the Montana Supreme Court and is an issue that very well could end up, if I am confirmed and sworn in, in my court, so I probably need to be careful and stay between the ditches on that one. Senator Grassley. And if I call you Kathy instead of trying to pronounce your last name, would you forgive me? Judge Bencivengo. That's fine. It's Bencivengo. Senator Grassley. In your Senate questionnaire you listed cases in which you were sometimes reversed in whole or in part by reviewing courts. Would you care to comment on those reversals and share with the Committee--in fact, the second part of this question is the most important one. Share with the Committee what you learned from those experiences. Judge Bencivengo. Yes, Senator. Thank you for the question. I believe that most of the cases involved reports and recommendations that I made to District judges where generally parties are then given an opportunity to file further paper and make further argument, and consequently the modifications and reversals may result from a better record in front of the District judge on review of the report and recommendations. There certainly were instances where there might have been either a change or a misinterpretation of the law on my end, and therefore the lesson always for me is to be as diligent as I can in interpretation and application of the law. Senator Grassley. Judge Groh, I'm going to ask you a question from one of your cases, but it doesn't involve just your case. But it's kind of to get your feeling about sentencing guidelines/recommendations that you might be asking the Federal court. They're voluntary, but how you might respond to them. As a West Virginia Circuit Court judge you presided over a case involving an eighth grade female teacher sending sexually explicit messages to, and engaging in, inappropriate conduct with a 14-year-old male student. According to press accounts, the prosecutor and the defendant reached a plea agreement in which the teacher agreed to plead guilty to one count of sexual abuse by a person in trust, and in return the prosecutor would seek that she serve 10 years probation and no more than 4 months jail sentence in lieu of a 10- to 20-year prison sentence. Did you have any concerns about this plea agreement given the seriousness of the conduct at hand? More importantly, at sentencing, you sentenced the teacher to only 3 months in jail instead of the 4 months permitted in the plea agreement. What factors led you to that decision? Judge Groh. Thank you for that question, Senator. While going into the sentencing phase of that proceeding I wondered myself if the plea should be accepted, but a number of components go into sentencing an individual in State court, and also in Federal court as well. I learned more about the defendant as an individual. I considered the position of the victim or the victim's mother, the position of the investigating officer, the position of the State, the defendant's criminal history, which really she didn't have any criminal history to my recollection, and the specifics of the crime or offense in and of itself that she was pleading to. That's how I reached my conclusion, as I do in every case, on what the appropriate sentence is. Now, bringing it forward, if I were so fortunate to be serving on the Federal bench, I know that we have the guideline--or would have the guidelines there and the guidelines are no longer mandatory. However, I would give deference to the guidelines. I believe it's important to have uniformity in sentencing. That's also another issue I look at, not between defendants if they're involved in different offenses in State court, but if the defendants--or for my court a co-defendant--they also have to make sure that there's no disparity in sentencing. Senator Grassley. You answered my follow-up question, so I'll move on to Ms. Brodie. Just one question for you. I might have some in writing for all of the judges. From May of 2005 to March of 2006, you served as a legal advisor to the Independent Core Practices and Other Related Offices Commission in Nigeria. In this role I understand you advised and trained over 100 prosecutors and investigators on all aspects of prosecution. So I'd like to have you comment on how this experience will affect you as a Federal judge, when confirmed. Ms. Brodie. Well, thank you for that question, Senator Grassley. I think I've learned quite a few things from working overseas, and particularly in that detail in Nigeria. It has made me realize and recognize that we are very blessed here in the United States to have a very functional judicial system, which is something that most countries don't have. It has taught me the appreciation of knowing that the system that we have here in the United States can be recognized, relied on by the litigants who appear in court. In Nigeria, part of the problem with the judicial system-- the criminal justice system as a whole, in fact, which is something they're working on--is the fact that when matters are brought before the court they could take years to be concluded, because on every single matter that a judge rules on it can be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. That delays all the proceedings. It's especially bad for criminal proceedings where defendants are either incarcerated or not, but could spend years before a matter can be resolved simply because of the way in which the system is set up for that matter. So it does make me appreciate the fact that it's important that matters be litigated promptly, and if I were lucky enough to be confirmed to the position for which I've been nominated, one of the things that I would make sure that I do is to make decisions very quickly so that litigants, whether they be civil or criminal, who appear before the court, can know what the outcome is, and I will do so fairly and impartially. Thank you, Senator. Senator Grassley. I would say for all of you, just to caution. Even though your nominations appear to be non- controversial, sometimes for things unrelated to your qualifications or anything personal or ideological, nominees are held up because questions aren't answered fully. So I would encourage you all, if you have questions from the two of us or any of the 18 members of the Committee, I hope you will understand that we don't usually move ahead until all are satisfactorily answered. Mr. Christiansen. Thank you. Judge Bencivengo. Thank you, Senator. Judge Groh. Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. Let me ask each of you one final question before we adjourn the hearing. Who would you seek to emulate as a U.S. District judge? Somebody from history, or fiction, or from your personal experience in the law. Who would you think the model would be for your service as a judge, and why? Mr. Christiansen? Mr. Christiansen. Senator, that's a wonderful question. I was inspired to become a lawyer at a very early age by a practitioner in Missoula, Montana named Sherm Lawn. He's now deceased. The Kiwanis Club in Missoula had a program where you could spend a day shadowing someone in a profession, and I shadowed Sherm Lawn. He was a wonderful old-school trial lawyer. He had the finest ethics, he was collegial, and my parents, who unfortunately are now both deceased, would probably recall that I came home in about the 7th or 8th grade and said, I've decided this is what I want to do, I want to be a lawyer. So that person--he also gave me my first job while I was in law school. He meant a lot to me and he inspired me. Senator Whitehouse. Judge Bencivengo. Judge Bencivengo. Thank you, Senator. I wouldn't have to look far for examples of judges I would want to emulate. My District Court, I believe, has one of the best benches in the country. If I were to choose one of those judges, the position I'm being considered for, the judge who went senior and made that position available, Jeffrey Miller, I think, is an exemplary person to look to for judicial demeanor for his ability to make everyone in his courtroom feel comfortable, and yet still sustain the formality and the importance of the judiciary, his respect amongst the bar, and jurors who appear in front of him. I think he is just an extraordinary example of a fine judicial person and someone I would certainly wish to emulate. Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. Judge Groh. Judge Groh. The person who I wish to emulate, and would if I were so fortunate to find myself on the Federal bench, is Judge Irene Berger. Judge Berger was a Circuit Court when I became a Circuit Court judge. She was one of two, and Senator Manchin added me as the third. Judge Berger was confirmed toward the end of 2009 as a Federal judge. She serves in the Southern District of our State. The very first time I met her at my initial judicial conference, she gave me all her numbers and she held my hand, figuratively, and she has been doing that ever since, even throughout this process through the DOJ vetting and all the questionnaires, and phases and hoops that we've been going through. Our careers parallel. She was a former prosecutor, as was I, before she became a Circuit judge. She progressed and now is in what she tells me is the best job she's ever had on the Federal bench. She is well-respected. She's kind and compassionate, yet has control of her courtroom. She's even- tempered, smart, and hardworking, well-respected, as I said, among the bar. I was honored for the Supreme Court to replace her with me on our Judicial Ethics Hearing Board when she was elevated to the Federal bench. Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you. Ms. Brodie. Ms. Brodie. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Well, I can't decide on one judge because there are so many judges in the Eastern District of New York who I would love to emulate. There are many of them who I believe possess the right qualities that make for a wonderful judge. They're extremely decisive, they are smart, they have the right temperament. I love my job, and the reason I do is because it's a great job when you have to go to the courtroom of these judges every day and know that it's going to be a wonderful experience, regardless of whether or not the outcome, the ruling is what you want it to be. The experience is going to be enjoyable. That is what I hope to do, if I become confirmed to this position, to emulate all of those judges who have all of the fine qualities that I believe are important in a District Court judge. Senator Whitehouse. Good. Well, I wish you all well. I know that this process can be a bit of an ordeal as you go through repeated blockades of paperwork, but you're through all that now and you've had the happiest possible thing happen, which is to have the Ranking Member of the party other than the President who appointed you deem your nominations uncontroversial. [Laughter.] Senator Whitehouse. So I wish you well as you proceed through the Committee, and as we take up your nominations on the floor and in your service to our country to what I hope are long and productive lives on the bench. The hearing will remain open for an additional week if anybody wishes to add anything to the record, but we are, today, adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3:44 p.m. the meeting was adjourned.] [Questions and answers and submissions for the record follow.] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] NOMINATION OF ADALBERTO JOSE JORDAN, OF FLORIDA, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT; JOHN M. GERRARD, OF NEBRASKA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA; MARY ELIZABETH PHILLIPS, OF MISSOURI, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI; THOMAS OWEN RICE, OF WASHINGTON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON; AND DAVID NUFFER, OF UTAH, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH ---------- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2011 U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Amy Klobuchar, presiding. Present: Senators Klobuchar, Hatch, and Lee. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA Senator Klobuchar. I am pleased to call this nominations hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to order. Our Ranking Member today is Senator Hatch, and I know we have several members here to speak, to introduce. We have five judicial nominees today, so I would like to call upon my colleagues to introduce the nominees from their home State. We will start with Senator Nelson of Nebraska. PRESENTATION OF JOHN M. GERRARD, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, BY HON. BEN NELSON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEBRASKA Senator Nelson of Nebraska. Thank you, Madam Chair. It is truly my honor to join with my colleague, Senator Johanns, and introduce Nebraska's Supreme Court Justice John Gerrard, who has been nominated by the President for the U.S. District Court for Nebraska. I have known John and Nancy Gerrard and their family for nearly 20 years. I saw in him the experience, intellect, and temperament needed to serve on the Nebraska Supreme Court bench. So as Governor, I appointed John Gerrard to the Nebraska Supreme Court in 1995. The people of Nebraska have approved of his service and voted to retain Judge Gerrard on our State's highest court three times. He has consistently received top ratings by the Nebraska Bar Association in its biennial judicial evaluations. In 2006, Judge Gerrard received the Distinguished Judge for Improvement of the Judicial System Award for leading initiatives promoting racial and ethnic fairness under the law. In 2008, Judge Gerrard received the Legal Pioneer Award for utilizing technology to improve Nebraska citizens' understanding and participation in our courts. On the Nebraska Supreme Court, Judge Gerrard has authored more than 400 opinions. Other opinions written by Judge Gerrard have helped refine protocol for how many different types of cases are handled, including evidence requirements in homicide cases, how expert testimony is received, and clarifying duty analysis in negligence cases. Prior to his service on the Nebraska Supreme Court, Judge Gerrard was senior partner in the law firm of Gerrard, Stratton & Ptak in Norfolk, where he was in private practice for 14 years. He also served as the Battle Creek city attorney, as counsel to Northeast Community College, Norfolk Public Schools, and other northeast Nebraska school districts. I thank the members of the Senate, Madam Chair, Ranking Member Hatch, and Senator Lee, for considering this extremely well qualified nominee for the Federal bench. It is my hope the Committee will report out Judge Gerrard's nomination soon and that the full Senate will have the opportunity to swiftly approve this good man. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Now Senator Johanns from Nebraska. PRESENTATION OF JOHN M. GERRARD, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, BY HON. MIKE JOHANNS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEBRASKA Senator Johanns. Madam Chair, thank you very much. It is an honor for me to appear before this Committee. Let me, if I might, start this afternoon by saying thank you to my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Ben Nelson, and I definitely want to associate myself with the comments that he has just made. As we all know, Senator Nelson and I occupy different sides of the aisle, but I will tell you we both agree that the exceptional record and the experience of Judge Gerrard makes him an excellent candidate for the Federal Bench. Madam Chair, this is exactly as a nomination should occur. Before the nomination was even announced, Senator Nelson called me and he said, ``Here is what I am thinking about. I am thinking about Judge Gerrard for this U.S. district court position. Would you take the time to sit down and visit with him? '' So I did. So before any nomination was talked about publicly, I had an opportunity to go to the judge's Supreme Court office, and we talked. Of course, I have known him also for many, many years. I have always been impressed with his temperament, his background, his judicial philosophy, his record, and I could not more enthusiastically support this nomination. In fact, I was saying to my colleague as we were preparing to come into the hearing room, if I were king for a day, this is the kind of person I would nominate to the U.S. district court. So I appreciate being a part of this process. Judge Gerrard embodies integrity, judicial restraint, thoughtful fairness. He is a class act in every way, and he is absolutely the right person for this job. During his 16 years on the Nebraska Supreme Court, he has conducted himself in every way with great distinction. And every time his colleagues in the legal profession had an opportunity to rate him, they gave him the highest ratings. So I am very pleased to be here today. It is my hope that the Committee will agree with our assessment, vote him to the floor, and I want to assure the Chair and the Ranking Member I will do everything I possibly can to try to bring his nomination to a vote. It is critical that we fill this district court position. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Senator McCaskill of Missouri. PRESENTATION OF MARY ELIZABETH PHILLIPS, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI, BY HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MISSOURI Senator McCaskill. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I am honored today to be here to introduce Beth Phillips as a nominee for the Western District Court of Missouri. I had the pleasure of hiring Beth Phillips as a young assistant prosecutor many years ago, back in the 1990s, and I have watched her career, as has the rest of the bench and bar in Missouri, with a great deal of pride. When I used to be in the courtroom--and I know I probably can get some ``me, too's'' on this from the members of this Committee--nothing was more frustrating than having a judge presiding over a trial that it was fairly clear they had never been in a trial. And those people who do work in a courtroom know how great it is to have someone on the bench that understands exactly what it is like to be at the bar and to be arguing for your case and all of the challenges and frustrations that go with that. This is a woman who has tried over 40 cases in the courtroom; 90 percent of those were jury trials. She has tried those cases both as a prosecutor and as a civil litigant. She was appointed to be the U.S. Attorney for the Western District 2 years ago and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate 2 years ago. And since that time, she has overseen a staff of 126 employees, including 67 lawyers, in the Western District of Missouri as the U.S. Attorney. You know, whenever you have been involved in trying to help someone in their career, many times you get calls from--and I have got a lot of former friends and colleagues that practice law in the Kansas City area, and I will be honest with you. There have been times that I have gotten calls about this person or that person that were not always positive, like, you know, ``That person you hired is an idiot,'' or, ``I am really irritated at that person.'' And it is unbelievable to me the way that this woman's leadership has been greeted by both the judiciary and the litigants in the greater Kansas City area and in the Western District of Missouri. She is an undergraduate from the University of Chicago and a master's from the University of Chicago, and then she got some sense and came home and got her law degree in Missouri. She is a native Missourian, and I do not know how many generations of her family have been in Missouri, but she was born in a very small town in rural Missouri. And so when we went to the swearing-in as U.S. Attorney, I think half of her hometown was there. It was a moment of great pride for this very small community that she had reached this zenith. I think she is ready to take this lifetime appointment for so many reasons. It will be a two-judge family. Her husband is here with her today, Brent Powell, who was appointed to the State bench by my colleague's son, Governor Matt Blunt, when he was Governor. And I do not get into politics at these things. I do not think you should. But I think it tells you the kind of people these are that I am pushing for the appointment of Beth Phillips as a Federal judge when the man who defeated me for Governor appointed her husband as a State judge. I think that is the kind of bipartisanship we all long for in this body and certainly that we hope to get on the Federal judiciary. And I think that she will call balls and strikes. She will let people try their cases. She will not impose her judgment in terms of any bias she has on any matter of policy into the courtroom, and she will be the kind of Federal judge that will make us proud as the U.S. Senate and will do justice to our great Constitution and the system of checks and balances that it embraces. I would ask for favorable consideration from the Committee today for her appointment. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator McCaskill, and that is a lot of good information for us to have. We enjoyed that. Now we will turn from the Midwest to Florida. I think Senator Rubio was here first, and--you want Senator Nelson? Very nice. Senator Nelson, oh, my goodness, Senator Nelson will go first, and we are pleased to have both of you here on behalf of the Florida nominee. PRESENTATION OF ADALBERTO JOSE JORDAN, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. BILL NELSON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Senator Nelson of Florida. Well, this reminds me who is the senior Senator and who is the junior Senator. When Bob Graham was my senior Senator, he always expected me to serve him coffee. [Laughter.] Senator Rubio. I will be right back. [Laughter.] Senator Nelson of Florida. Well, the two of us are here unanimous because this is an excellent appointee by the President, and we urge upon the Committee for quick confirmation for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Madam Chairman, Judge Jordan will end up being the first Cuban American to sit on the court of appeals. That is significant in itself, but when you look at his life, all the way from being magna cum laude, the fact that he was a walk-on at the University of Miami baseball team and made the team, the fact that he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and served with distinction there and then was picked by President Clinton to be a Federal district judge, so he has been a judge now for well over a decade. And among all of his peers have had nothing but glowing comments once the President made his decision. And so this is a great day, and I want to just shorten my comments so that my colleague--and you are very kind--can say something about the historical significance of judge Jordan's nomination. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you. Senator Rubio. PRESENTATION OF ADALBERTO JOSE JORDAN, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. MARCO RUBIO, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Senator Rubio. Thank you, and I will also be brief because I think his experience and his resume will speak for itself. I just want to echo a few things. First of all, obviously as a community we are very proud of Judge Jordan's nomination and look forward to his appointment. I would add a couple things. He is, as I am, a law school graduate from the University of Miami. He is a double Hurricane, I should say, because also his bachelor's degree was from there. He has been serving for 12 years on the bench in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. At the time of his appointment, he was only 37 years old. He remains very active in our community. He is involved in teaching both at the University of Miami School of Law and at a newer place that is really growing rapidly, the Florida National University College of Law as well. I think his knowledge of the law is demonstrated further in part by his work as the chief of the Appellate Division in the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, which is a very active district in his time there practicing as an attorney. He spent time as a clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and he has served as a clerk to Judge Thomas Clark of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. So I am obviously honored and proud to be here introducing him to the Committee, and I look forward to your full consideration of his nomination. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Thank you both for coming, and we look forward to hearing from your nominee. Now we turn to the State of Utah with my colleague here, Senator Hatch, for an introduction. PRESENTATION OF DAVID NUFFER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH, BY HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Well, thank you, Madam Chairman. We are very happy, and I was very pleased to sit here with you and I am honored to be with you on this panel today. I am very pleased to introduce to the Committee Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge David Nuffer, and I want to congratulate President Obama for choosing him as the nominee to the U.S. District Court in Utah. After receiving his undergraduate and law degrees from Brigham Young University, Judge Nuffer spent 24 years in private legal practice. He has served for 16 years as the U.S. magistrate judge, half of those years part-time and half full- time. He has been the chief U.S. magistrate judge for the District of Utah since 2009, and as a lawyer, he practiced both in the criminal prosecution area and criminal defense, and he has tried more than 150 cases to verdict, which is more than most people who come before this body. I am not surprised that the American Bar Association unanimously gave him its highest well-qualified rating. In fact, I would have been upset if they had not. Judge Nuffer is widely known in Utah's legal community, and he is just as widely respected. I have talked to numerous lawyers in Utah, lawyers that I have tremendous respect for, and to a person, they all believe that he will be one of the great judges in this country. He has not only practiced law, but he has served the law as well as both a commissioner and as president of the Utah State Bar. He has served on various committees and task forces of the Utah Supreme Court and is Chairman of the Utah Judicial Conduct Commission. And for more than a decade, Judge Nuffer has been an adjunct professor at his law school alma mater. But his service to the law extends beyond our borders. Judge Nuffer has lectured to judges, lawyers, and law students in countries as far afield as Brazil, Egypt, and Ukraine, and serves on the board of the Leavitt Institute for International Development. As my colleagues know, I chair the Senate Republican High- Tech Task Force and have for many years been involved in efforts to reform the patent system. I therefore took particular notice of Judge Nuffer's love of technology and the promise that it holds for the legal system. In one of his many articles and blog postings, he wrote, ``Technology is a leveler that puts us all in touch, reduces the distance from the courthouse, and leverages our abilities.'' I cannot agree more. When he is confirmed, as I know he will be, Judge Nuffer will help make the law and the court system more accessible to all of our citizens. This well-rounded picture of dedication, service, and excellence has really impressed me, as it has, I am sure, many others in Utah and around the country. As I usually do when we have a judicial vacancy, I talk to lawyers and leaders in the legal community of both parties throughout Utah, and in Judge Nuffer's case, the response was strong and unanimous, and we are very proud of you and we are looking forward to you serving a nice long time on the Federal bench. And we are very happy to have your lovely wife with you as well. Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Senator Lee. PRESENTATION OF DAVID NUFFER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH, BY HON. MIKE LEE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Lee. Thank you, Madam Chair. It is my pleasure to say a few words to support the nomination of Magistrate Judge Nuffer. I will be brief. I will also be personal. I am one of those lawyers who has appeared in front of him, and I have found him to be a judge who is unusually well informed, well prepared, and exercises exceptionally good judgment. And I commend President Obama for his excellent choice in this nomination. As Senator Hatch noted, over the course of his career Judge Nuffer has worked tirelessly and with distinction to serve the bar and the bench in Utah and beyond. For example, he has served as president of the Utah State Bar Association, as a member of the Utah District Court's Civil Procedure Rules Committee, the Utah District Court Arbitration and Mediation Panel, and the National U.S. Court IT Advisory Committee. Judge Nuffer has also written or presented extensively on a variety of legal and law-related issues, especially those involving the use of technology by litigants and in the courts. The many attorneys and judges that have read his publications and attended his lectures and other seminars have benefited greatly from his expertise. Judge Nuffer has also served as an adjunct professor at BYU's law school for the past decade, where he helped to prepare the next generation of attorneys. Finally, let me add that Judge Nuffer is well known and highly regarded throughout the Utah bench and bar. His knowledge, his temperament, his expertise, including those 16 years that he served first as a part-time magistrate judge and then as a full-time magistrate judge, are among the many qualities for which he is rightly admired. I am pleased enthusiastically to recommend him to my fellow colleagues on this Committee, and I ask for your full consideration of this outstanding nominee. Th"
