Some of it open ended, some of it due by 2028. That's a lot of dosh loaned at very favourable rates. Indeed, some of it will likely be converted to equity.\n\nThey cannot simply loan more in order to fund player purchases. That's the whole point of the Financial Sustainability Rules. They did just as you suggest to back Gerrard and got us on a watchlist and in a real financial pickle to boot, and rules have got tighter since then. The Annual Report for 2021 shows Directors and other investors putting in over £20m in the preceding year for example.\n\nWe've been f*cked by poor player recruitment by GvB/Wilson and then Beale. Largely on the back of funds brought in by selling Gerrard's signings but all we have left to flog now is, in the main, the GvB/Beale deadwood - and its not attracting bidders.\n\nDirectors loans are currently at more than £13m mate.

Obviously more difficult to do with FFP.\n\nOur recruitment needs to be better, we have made big mistakes costing big money.\n\nThe conveyer belt of regularly injured players that we sign in the hope that it won’t happen to us, the punts on the English markets, holding on to players when they should have been sold or released, the lack of ruthlessness with players has seen us piss millions up against the wall.\n\nWe seem to make lots of mistakes with players, I know all clubs make mistakes and there is no guarantee but we have made some real criminal mistakes with players.\n\nThe player trading model done right would work but it needs a real boost to get it off the ground. It is almost like working the stocks, you need to invest, get it right and sell. You can’t do this without that budget to get it up and running.\n\nWe have no real history in selling players also for big money on a regular basis so we always look weak going in to these sale negotiations.\n\nI am beginning to waffle on a bit on this.\n\nAnyway, I like you and many others on FF and the rest of the fans love the bones of this fucking club, I want to see the club winning on and off the park.

I am frustrated with the position we are in at the moment.\n\nSorry to jump in,you are the first person to make a reasoned arguement for Board change and you make some valid points.\n\nAt the same time I would bevery nervous about particularly beingtaken over by a business.\n\nWe have been through that situation before with John Lawrence Group and MIH,both didnt end well for us.\n\nAny business taking on Rangers would only be interested in what they can get out of it and you leave the Club at the mercy of market conditions and regime change within these businesses which would ultimately have a negative effect on us as was the case withthese two companies and thats before you even start on the fat slugs conglomerate.\n\nYou can argue about the success or otherwise of the current and recent Boards but you cant argue that they dont have the best interests of the Club at heart.\n\nYou wont find many fans of any Club that are happy with their board look at the mhanks and their board has been successful albeit mostly by default.\n\nI would prefer to concentrate on bringing the best individuals in along with attracting as much sponsorship and concentrating on the player trading model.\n\nI am not advocating for a sugar daddy, a Rich soulless Sheikh to use us a toy and then feck off and leave us in the shit.\n\nthe club needs real investment, major investment, the player trading model is defo the place to be but really needs forward investment to get it off the ground.\n\nWe are trying to get a multi million pound player trading model off the ground by spending buttons.

Our board don’t seem to have this\n\nAgain, just my opinion and not looking to be controversial, as I have said a few times now I have no faith in the current board and how they do football business\n\nWe are not in this current situation because our board don't have deep pockets.\n\nYou've witnessed every loss this club has made largely being written off by our board as far as FFP allows most of the last 5 seasons.\n\nOur total wagebill is ample, even after the reduction, and I'd expect us to go back towards spending a little more freely next summer than we have this one\n\nHow it's used has been an issue, but we've lived well beyond our means for 3/4 of the last 6 years I'd say.\n\nThis has been the debate many times on here, it is the go to safe counter arguement. Who will take us on, they will take all the money, go on then name a name etc etc.\n\nMaybe Redbull, City Group or fecking JayZ. Who knows.\n\nYou can’t answer that until there looks to be a desire to sell the club, I don’t dislike these guys, I don’t have hate for them, I am really grateful for all they have done.\n\nI just think they have gone as far as they can, it happens in business, sometimes a business needs fresh eyes, new ideas, etc to progress.\n\nI do not believe these guys will take us forward, what I have seen from them so far is stumbling from one disaster to another and ultimately it’s the football on the pitch that is suffering.\n\nThings need to change\n\nIf there were any potential investors out there, I am sure we would have heard from them by now.\n\nThe guys at the helm currently are the only ones who have stepped up.\n\nThey didn't do it for the kudos, but because, in the main, they are Rangers supporters, like the rest of us.\n\nThey may not be ideal, and they have made mistakes, as do boards of many companies, but they have the club at heart.\n\nThe current board inherited a shitshow, including the one left by Dave King, but they have put their money where their mouths are and invested in the club. Some of the disasters you mention have been inherited from the spivs and the situation they left us in, and some from the way DK etc. tried to get us out of that situation. There was no easy solution, but I think we are getting to the end of it now.\n\nHoping for some new \"sugar daddy\" to step in is a pipe dream, especially with the current restrictions of FFP. It won't happen, so I think you are hoping for a miracle. No-one is going to invest decent money in Scottish football. There is no return in it.\n\nAs a club, we are still suffering from the effects of 2012, although I think we are now about to finally move on from that. The football side, I believe, will start to get better and the financial restrictions we have been under will also start to improve, but these things take time. There is, and never has been, a quick fix to what we have gone through.\n\nHowever, the appointment of the new CEO is crucial and the board cannot afford to make a mistake with this appointment. If we get that right, then the \"disasters\" should stop. If not, then I may have to jump ship to your side, but for the moment, I think the board deserve the right to keep on with their plans.\n\nI now await the condemnation of my views from the FF hordes.\n\nIf there were any potential investors out there, I am sure we would have heard from them by now.\n\nThe guys at the helm currently are the only ones who have stepped up.\n\nThey didn't do it for the kudos, but because, in the main, they are Rangers supporters, like the rest of us.\n\nThey may not be ideal, and they have made mistakes, as do boards of many companies, but they have the club at heart.\n\nThe current board inherited a shitshow, including the one left by Dave King, but they have put their money where their mouths are and invested in the club.

Pretty basic things as well like commissioning a memorial wall without even looking at plans, starting major building works without knowing when materials would arrive and games vs that other lot in Australia.\n\nI’d 100% agree that no mega rich Sheikh is buying Ranges anytime soon but we can’t continue to be run in such a shambolic way indefinitely and things need to change at boardroom level.\n\nFinancially we look in a mess so the restrictions are probably going to get worse not better if we fail to make the CL this season. We’ve gone from a squad with multiple sellable assets to very little now so can’t really trade our way out of this in the short term.\n\nAlso while I hope to be proved wrong I just can’t see anyone other than another lazy Stewart Robertson type appointment as CEO hired soon as well.\n\nWe need fresh ideas at boardroom level to move the club forward.\n\n​\n\nIf there were any potential investors out there, I am sure we would have heard from them by now.\n\nThe guys at the helm currently are the only ones who have stepped up.\n\nThey didn't do it for the kudos, but because, in the main, they are Rangers supporters, like the rest of us.\n\nThey may not be ideal, and they have made mistakes, as do boards of many companies, but they have the club at heart.\n\nThe current board inherited a shitshow, including the one left by Dave King, but they have put their money where their mouths are and invested in the club.

Plenty of investors would want a controlling say to even consider bidding. There has certainly been no indication that the current guys are looking to step away.\n\nThe current board did inherate a shit show, we have been a sit show of a business for a long time.\n\nI would argue though that the current guys are also adding to the shit show with the continued mistakes we are seeing from them. Budgets given to rookie managers, the stadium, the lack of funds for the current manager, etc.\n\nAs another above has mentioned we need an active CEO and someone that is from the football world, someone to guide the club forward, work directly with the manager, recruitment team and all other spects of the football club.\n\nWe need a leader that is full time on all club duties and not distracted with their own business interests, someone that has worked the football world, someone that is going to take the club forward on and off the park.\n\nI understand the restrictions of FFP, a crazy sugar daddy wouldnt be able to come in and throw billions at it, its not allowed but there is still scope for a decent volume of investment that can go in to the club to help sort the football on the pitch.\n\nYou make a lot of good points pal and I am not trying to stir up an internal war or arguement on this, there should be no hordes jumping on anyone for having a different view on this situation.\n\nI would assume there are plenty like you that are pro the board and plenty like me that think they have went as far as they can go.\n\nI have said a few times on this thread that I have no needle with the current board, they stepped up when others didnt and will always deserve the credit for doing so, I would argue that till the cows come home.\n\nYou would never know the potential investments out there untl there was an obvious move by the board to step asise.

Budgets given to rookie managers, the stadium, the lack of funds for the current manager, etc.\n\nAs another above has mentioned we need an active CEO and someone that is from the football world, someone to guide the club forward, work directly with the manager, recruitment team and all other spects of the football club.\n\nWe need a leader that is full time on all club duties and not distracted with their own business interests, someone that has worked the football world, someone that is going to take the club forward on and off the park.\n\nI understand the restrictions of FFP, a crazy sugar daddy wouldnt be able to come in and throw billions at it, its not allowed but there is still scope for a decent volume of investment that can go in to the club to help sort the football on the pitch.\n\nA fair and reasoned reply W, and I know you aren't trying to stir up an internal war mate. It's just a debate about the board, borne out of the frustration caused by recent events, including our late collapse last season.\n\nPlease don't label me as \"pro board\" though, as I know they have made some very poor decisions. I am quite neutral on them but I just don't see that a wholesale change at the top will improve us as quickly as some seem to think.\n\nAny change will take time for new ideas etc to be implemented, whereas, i genuinely think that we are heading in the right direction. It all stems from what we do on the pitch and I do think we will improve in that area. I know that is also up for debate and many will not agree but that is what a discussion forum is for.\n\nHad we carried a bit more luck with injuries, had the players not shat the bed at the end of last season, and had some very dubious decisions not gone against us in very important matches, we could be sitting here praising the board and the issues which are now so important may not seem to be. Unfortunately, while we came close last season, we ultimately failed, so the off pitch issues are highlighted.\n\nPlease don't think I am a happy clapper, I am not. I am as frustrated as anyone else, but I think they are on the verge of getting things right and positive changes will start to take effect, albeit transfers are taking longer than I would have hoped.\n\nAs I said in my last post, the appointment of the correct person as CEO is of vital importance. If we get that wrong, and if the first few games are a shit show, I too will be looking out my pitchfork.\n\nA fair and reasoned reply W, and I know you aren't trying to stir up an internal war mate.

It looks like it is 1 out (First) then 1 in which does nothing for my nerves.\n\nSuccess on the pitch will buy them the time and support of the full fan base, I hope they can get us to what we all want but as I have said I dont have any faith in them.\n\nThey need to get the right appointments for CEO it is such a vital role, for some weird reason even on the club website they still have Bisgrove showing as the CEO????\n\nWe need to make the CL groups this year, that has the ability of really giving the club a major financial boost and hopefully the majority of it heads to the transfer pot"
