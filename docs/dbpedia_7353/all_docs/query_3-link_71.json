        "text": "Wï»¿e asked for your thoughts on Michael Beale's appointment, after he was announced as the new Rangers manager yesterday.\n\nHï»¿ere's a taste of what you had to say:\n\nAï»¿ntony: We need to get the team playing well. Iâm a bit concerned about the loyalty the club is giving to players I feel have let the club down for far too long. Letâs hope Beale can get some enthusiasm back into the players who have looked rather apathetic! Would love him to do well but I think this season has already gone and we need to rebuild the team.\n\nAï»¿udrey: I would get rid of Ross Wilson and get someone with a bit of nous to be above Beale. He could also bring Gerrard back as his number 2??\n\nIï»¿an: It all points to a lazy search by the board. At this moment in time Rangers need a strong manager with more experience. Michael Beale just seems to be an easy fix for the board. The Rangers support is being short changed by a board that didn't look very far for a manager that could turn the club around. We area shadow of our former selves.\n\nHï»¿eather: Brilliant appointment. Michael Beale is highly regarded by his peers. Bring it on.\n\nDï»¿ougie: Bottom line, there is a limited budget. I don't think any manager would have pleased every fan. MB is a gamble, but so is any appointment. I like the way he talks and just hope signings were discussed at the interview, as Ross Wilson needs to take a step back from that. All the best Michael.\n\nNï»¿eil: I wanted Gio to stay, he is a Rangers man and deserved to be given more time to turn it around despite the poor performances. Injuries, lack of investment, and a bruising Champions League campaign have had a huge impact on domestic results. But now that Gio is gone, Iâm glad itâs Beale that replaces him.\n\nPï»¿aul: Iâll give the man a year before theyâre looking for a new manager, and thatâs coming from a non Old Firm fan."
