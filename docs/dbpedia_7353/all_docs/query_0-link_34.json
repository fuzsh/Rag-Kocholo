        "text": "The Distinguished Teaching Award is presented annually by the Academic Senate and the Teaching and Learning Center. The goal of the Distinguished Teaching Award is to increase awareness of UCLA’s leadership in teaching and public service by honoring individuals who bring respect and admiration to teaching at UCLA. By recognizing teachers for their achievements, the award gives UCLA an opportunity to demonstrate to the community, alumni, students, parents, donors, and others what makes UCLA “a beacon of excellence in higher education.” These awards are an effective way to boost morale on campus, provide role models for faculty and students, and highlight best practices.\n\nHistory\n\nAdministration of the award selection process was previously managed by the Academic Senate and awardees were selected by the Committee on Teaching (COT). With the sunsetting of the COT in Spring 2022, the the administration of the Distinguished Teaching Awards was moved to the Teaching and Learning Center (formerly Center for the Advancement of Teaching). A new Distinguished Teaching Awards Selection Committee was established to review nominated dossiers and to select the recipients.\n\nSenate Members\n\nThe UCLA Alumni Association first presented the Distinguished Teaching Awards in 1961 to Academic Senate members. Traditionally, five teaching awards were presented to Senate members by the Alumni Association. One of these five Senate winners is cited for Distinction in Teaching at the Graduate Level and another is designated to receive the Eby Award for the Art of Teaching.\n\nIn 2004, a sixth award for Distinction in Undergraduate Research Mentorship was implemented to honor an Academic Senate faculty member who has provided superb mentorship to undergraduate students engaged in research and/or creative, scholarly projects. The new award was recommended by the Joint Taskforce on Undergraduate Education in a Research Context.\n\nNon-Senate Members\n\nIn spring of 1985, the Center for the Advancement of Teaching (formerly the Office of Instructional Development) sponsored three more awards given to instructors who are not Senate members. This category includes lecturers, adjunct professors, and clinical faculty members.\n\nTeaching Assistants\n\nIn 1975, the Office of Instructional Development began sponsorship of awards to teaching assistants.\n\nAward Categories\n\nBecause great teachers come from all academic ranks, we encourage you to nominate anyone who teaches graduate and/or undergraduate students and meets the program’s criteria.\n\nThere are three award categories:\n\nDistinguished Teaching Award: Senate Faculty (6 Senate members)\n\nDistinguished Teaching Award: Non-Senate Faculty (3 Non-Senate faculty)\n\nDistinguished Teaching Assistant Award (5 Teaching Assistants)\n\nRecipients receive a cash award and recognition by the Academic Senate. The Senate faculty and Non-Senate awardees receive $6,000, and teaching assistant recipients receive $2,500. A $20,000 Dissertation Year Fellowship Award from the UCLA Graduate Division will also be given to teaching assistants who are eligible. In addition, awardees are honored at the annual Andrea L. Rich Night to Honor Teaching ceremony at the Chancellor’s Residence.\n\nCriteria\n\nIn evaluating “distinguished teaching,” the following factors are considered:\n\nImpact on students (e.g., had a role in the eventual success of the students, helped change students’ majors or career plans, or significantly influenced students’ lives)\n\nEfforts to create a learning environment in which diverse students can succeed\n\nScholarly approach to teaching (e.g., the use of innovative teaching methods in the classroom, programmatic innovations in curriculum, and the impact such innovations might have at the local or national level)\n\nSize, number, and diversity of courses taught\n\nInvolvement in community outreach activities\n\nTeaching ratings\n\nEligibility\n\nA Department, Interdepartmental Degree Program (IDP), Center for Interdisciplinary Instruction (CII), or other Academic unit offering regular undergraduate, graduate, or professional instruction may submit no more than one nomination per category for this award. Self-nominations will not be accepted. Past recipients of the Distinguished Teaching Award are ineligible again for the award in the same category.\n\nDistinguished Teaching Award: Senate Faculty\n\nAcademic Senate members (members of the following series: Professor, Professor in Residence, and Professor of Clinical X, as well as Acting Professors, Acting Associate Professors, full-time Lecturers with Security of Employment, full-time Senior Lecturers with Security of Employment) at the time of nomination.\n\nDistinguished Teaching Award: Non-Senate Faculty\n\nNon-Senate Faculty (faculty in the Adjunct series, Clinical compensated series, Visiting Professors, Acting Assistant Professors, Lecturers, Academic Administrators) at the time of nomination.\n\nDistinguished Teaching Assistant Award\n\nCurrently enrolled graduate students who have served or are serving in a teaching apprenticeship under the tutelage and supervision of regular faculty at the time of nomination and have at least one additional year of enrollment.\n\nSelection Process\n\nThe Distinguished Teaching Award Selection Committee is responsible for the annual review and selection process of the Distinguished Teaching Award recipients. The committee reviews dossiers submitted for the three award categories and selects the awardees.\n\nThe membership is comprised of:\n\nNine at-large faculty members serving three-year staggered terms, such that three members rotate off each year\n\nOne graduate student\n\nOne undergraduate student\n\nOne ex-officio member from the Teaching and Learning Center\n\nThe committee meets four times a year, between January and May, to deliberate on the nominated dossiers for each award category.\n\nAll nominations must be submitted online via the respective application form by the published deadline.\n\nA Department, Interdepartmental Degree Program (IDP), Center for Interdisciplinary Instruction (CII), or other Academic unit offering regular undergraduate, graduate, or professional instruction may submit no more than one nomination per category for this award. Self-nominations will not be accepted. Past recipients of the Distinguished Teaching Award are ineligible again for the award in the same category.\n\nRequirements\n\nPlease note that the committee receives many applications.
