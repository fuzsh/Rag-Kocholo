        "text": "LinkedIn recently posted about \"34 Big Ideas that Will Change our World in 2024.\" One of those big ideas: FOBO ‚Äî the fear of being obsolete, especially in an AI-driven economy. The fear is real. But realizing it doesn't have to be. Because there truly are some skills that machines can't replicate. By definition, one of those skills is making humans feel valued ‚Äî be they your coworkers, customers, investors, or donors. The Moral Courage Project has launched a site showing how organizations can unify their people despite all the fears unleashed by technology, politics, and culture. The key: developing in-house talent who mentor fellow employees in the habits that bring people together. These mentors aren't outside consultants. They're trusted peers. Trusted, because they come from within. We train and certify them as ‚ÄúMoral Courage Mentors.\" Explore: moralcourage.org. Civic Alliance Chris Harry Erik Benchoff Seth Cohen Allison Gerrard\n\nIt's been a dream since before I can remember. After two years of studying, learning, growing, changing, redirecting, trying, failing, and ultimately succeeding, I've added those letters to the end of my name. Madeline C. Mulkey Ledford, MBA. Here are 3 takeaways reflecting back on this chapter: 1Ô∏è‚É£ üß† : Be a Life long Learner: Emory's motto is \"The wise heart seeks knowledge.\" Whether it's by sitting in a class lecture, listening to a podcast (The Daily and Acquiring Minds being my favorites right now), or reading a books by a diverse group of authors, my aspiration in grad school was to learn at least one thing each day, something I will take with me into this next chapter of my career. 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úç : Importance of Reflection: The importance of reflection cannot be overstated as the leader of my own life, and as a leader of people. Reflection solidifies learnings, making growth possible. My preference for reflection is journaling, but reflection of any kind, whether in a formal after action review, or simply sitting around the dinner table together chatting with a trusted ally is essential to actual growth. 3Ô∏è‚É£ üôå : Change happens when we work together: The power of a team working together effectively will outshine the individual every time. I had the pleasure of working with two incredible teams this past year as the Managing Partner of the Peachtree Minority Venture Fund and as the President of the Goizueta Women in Business, and these two organizations are just two reminders of the power of \"we.\" Though I was the one physically in the classroom, I could not have done it would the amazing community around me. There is a huge list of people to thank, but the biggest goes to Will Ledford, the best support system I could ask for before, during, and after this experience.\n\nI‚Äôm often asked for my career advice to the next generation coming up and it‚Äôs not always easy to answer. In an ever-changing world, technological innovation and global politics shift norms quickly. What doesn‚Äôt change is having the right attitude and posture. Thoughtful earnest hustle is always in style but you have to do it right. Be a real one. Always acknowledge collaborators, commit to life-long learning, don‚Äôt embellish your record and commit to investing in others. This is the difference between a leader and a specialist. I don‚Äôt know why this needs to be said, but authentic, earnest commitment to your team is the number one way to attract others to your causes. Accolades and sustainable advancement come from effort and from results, not rhetoric. Especially your own.\n\nReflecting on the myriad experiences that sculpted my professional journey, I always discuss the impact of startups and the steep learning curve they embody. But, one pivotal decision made a decade ago has profoundly altered my trajectory more than any career move or professional endeavor. Growing up in the vibrant melting pot of San Francisco, diversity was baked into my upbringing. My friends varied in thought, socio-economic background, and in countless other ways. Amidst this tapestry of human experiences, I've observed a common oversight: the tendency to confine our circles to peers of similar age. This comfortable approach narrows our world, shielding us from the rich mentorship, perspectives, and wisdom that other generations generously offer. A decade ago, I consciously diversified the age range of my friends. This decision has unfolded into what I consider my ultimate asset and secret weapon. My social circle now spans across generations, from insightful 20-somethings who keep me abreast of trends like TikTok and the evolving landscape of social media, to the profound wisdom of friends in their 40s, 50s,60s, 70s and even 80s. Each age group brings a unique perspective, enriching my life and broadening my understanding of the world. This blend of youthful energy and seasoned wisdom has been a cornerstone of my personal and professional growth. It's a testament to the fact that learning and inspiration don't adhere to age limits‚Äîthey're boundless. Embracing intergenerational friendships is, in my eyes, the ultimate learning curve‚Äîone that teaches empathy, encourages innovation, and fosters a deeper appreciation for the journey, not just the destination. I share this reflection not just as a personal anecdote but as an invitation to explore beyond the familiar confines of your social circles. The rewards, as I have found, are immeasurable. #IntergenerationalFriendship #DiversityInThought #ProfessionalGrowth\n\nüíä Notes on striking a balance between macro- and microcultures: Each of us has a 'zone' that embodies our core beliefs and guiding principles. Stepping into this zone feels like embarking on a personal journey, navigating away from the broader macroculture toward a more intimate realm thriving with microcultures. It's a moment that sparks a sense of aliveness, allowing us to momentarily forget about the pressures society places upon us. It's fascinating how an individual person can now outshine massive corporations armed not with fancy degrees, but with the skills cultivated within ones personal zone. This shift reshapes what it means to be professional. Embracing and nurturing our personal zone is like grabbing that \"red pill\" for unleashing creativity. Gone are the days solely focused on executing tasks; now, our world calls for the birth of fresh, innovative ideas. The journey to discovering your zone starts by understanding ones core values and observing how they influence ones actions. Rather than copying others, this path encourages introspection and authenticity. How often do you sneak away from society's nosy clutches and indulge in your own little world?\n\nI was 16 years old when I had an honest conversation about college with my parents. We openly discussed a nontraditional path that included entrepreneurship. At the time, my twin brother was interested in attending a great university and eventually did. Our decisions became what I still call a conscious life experiment: two different paths, two different adventures. Then, you can call it luck, or you can call it intention; I met Gordon Rudow and was introduced to the world of graphic facilitation. It just felt perfect. It was me. Starting at age 19, I traveled and worked with extraordinary minds. I supported CEOs, authors, executive teams, and other leaders by capturing strategy sessions and other vital conversations in real-time. We created artifacts of group memory so they could be shared with others to take action with a clearer sense of vision and purpose. I eventually took college classes at night to meet friends and study film, advertising, geology, and tech. My purpose was not to focus on a degree but on things I was passionate about. To be clear, I am a huge proponent of higher education and have enjoyed working directly with (and teaching at) many extraordinary colleges and universities. I chose a different path that made sense to me. I credit my parents, especially my mother, for giving me the opportunity of choice. Since that conversation, they have never questioned my intentions. My path has led me to start three different companies, all of which have shared the goal of creating better places for people to work. My career (so far) has provided me the luxury of helping over 200 companies and organizations improve how they communicate, and our work has positively impacted many people. I understand that I have been lucky, and every day, I remember to be grateful for my job. Our tools and methods continue to evolve, but the commitment remains the same. My purpose is to enable people to do the best work of their lives. I share this story to remind others that having an opportunity or being given permission to make a choice can be a true gift. My path is not for everyone. However, it can make sense for some.\n\nBill Gates dropped out of Harvard üë®üéì But you won‚Äôt want to miss the advice he wished he‚Äôd got on his graduation day‚Ä¶ _____ 1 - Your life isn‚Äôt a one act play - It's a good thing to re-evaluate yourself and your goals - Bill used to think he'd work at Microsoft forever - Now his purpose has changed to philanthropy. 2 - You are never too smart to be confused - Bill used to think he knew everything - Until he leaned into learning into things he didn't know - And learned the value of asking others for help. 3 - Gravitate towards work that solves a problem - Industries and technology advancements are creating opportunities - Spend your days doing something that solves a big problem - It‚Äôll energise you to do your best work. 4 - Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of friendship - His biggest regret is not being sociable enough - Warren Buffet gave him the best piece of advice he ever recieved: ‚ÄúIn the end, it‚Äôs how friends really think of you and how strong those friendships are [that matters]‚Äù 5 - You are not a slacker if you cut yourself some slack - Becoming a Dad made Bill realise there's more to life than working 24/7 - Give yourself a break - Take it easy on those around you too. _____ I'm Aaron Norris üö¥‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÉ‚ôÇÔ∏è Click my name + follow + üîî Please like and repost to share with your network üôè ___ WORK WITH ME I help Account Execs accelerate their careers to the top of the IC world, sustainably Click the link in my Featured section, or DM me ACCELERATE.\n\nIn the midst of our busy lives chasing ambitious goals, it is crucial to reflect on a fundamental truth i have come to discover ‚Äì investing in myself is the most valuable investment i can make. I am my greatest asset, and nurturing personal growth is incredibly important as it is something that no one can take away from me. While financial aims are significant, I have often overlook another vital aspect of success ‚Äì continuous self-improvement. This perspective sometimes gets overshadowed by other aspirations, but it's time for me look look deeper and rethink my priorities. Think about the impact of gaining knowledge. Every piece of wisdom i acquire, no matter the subject, becomes a part of my life's fabric. These fragments of understanding connect seamlessly, enriching my viewpoints and, remarkably, strengthening my relationships. Guided by this philosophy, I've set an exciting challenge for myself in the upcoming weeks. I'm immersing myself in understanding Human Resources intricacies, mastering Customer Relations Management, and honing my Sales skills. What's truly intriguing is the wealth of free resources available online. The internet offers a treasure trove of courses, articles, and practical tools, inviting us to dive into the sea of knowledge and emerge transformed. And I'm not embarking on this journey alone. I wholeheartedly invite each of you to join me. Let's build a dynamic community of growth enthusiasts, united by our commitment to lifelong learning. Through sharing the resources that have shaped our perspectives, we'll forge connections that resonate with the pulse of progress. So, as we embark on this journey of self-enhancement together, let's celebrate the power of learning and self-discovery. This is a chance to enrich our lives, push our limits, and become empowered individuals ready for the ever-evolving future. #personaldevelopment #personalgrowth #community"
