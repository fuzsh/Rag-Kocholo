        "text": "In an announcement to investors, Fluor said the move would enable Bruer to drive a more holistic view of Fluor’s market strengths and needs in project delivery and talent allocation across the company’s three business segments – energy solutions, mission solutions and urban solutions.\n\nAt the same time, Kevin Hannonds, the company’s long standing managing general counsel and senior vice president, has been appointed to executive vice president and chief legal officer, succeeding John Reynolds who will retire from the company after nearly 40 years of service.\n\nReynolds will remain as corporate secretary to Fluor’s board of directors until May 2025.\n\n“I could not be more pleased with the progress we have made over the past few years under our building a better future strategy,” said David E. Constable, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fluor. “As we wrap up the first chapter of this strategy, it’s time to develop plans for the next chapter, including maximizing opportunities in growth markets, remaining laser focused on execution, generating consistent operating cash flow and continuing to develop the company’s most important resource, our people.”"
