        "text": "Dear Regis University graduates,\n\nNever in our world’s history has cura personalis – or care for the individual – been more relevant or important. One of the hallmarks of a Jesuit education is centering your intellectual, affective and spiritual growth. This foundational growth is at the core of your curriculum. The focus is as much on your development as any subject or materials to be covered. Your growth is aligned to your pace and rhythm, your individual ability and your own personality.\n\nAs much as any lab, novel, algorithm or code, your personal development is what trains and defines your character. And your character is what helps you overcome selfishness or apathy and discover an abiding respect and responsibility to make the world a better place. This allows you to better recognize the human dignity of each and all individuals. Concern for total human development is a responsible use of personal and civic freedom. This too allows us to discover prejudice and limitations in our worldview and how this might impact the life of another person.\n\nRegis University’s mission is to educate you, as men and women of all ages and faiths, to take leadership roles and to make a positive impact in an evolving society. We do this through our Jesuit foundation, giving you an excellent, value-centered and experiential education that honors the whole person — your mind, body and spirit. Use your abilities to discern, to question, to discover — and the mission of Regis University — to seek and be a source of light in the darkness. For almost 500 years, graduates of all Jesuit colleges and universities across the world have heard the charge of St. Ignatius of Loyola to “Go forth and set the world on fire.”\n\nBe beacons and shine on.\n\nKindly,\n\nSalvador Aceves, Ed.D.\n\nPresident\n\nAcademic Honors\n\nRegis University proudly recognizes graduating students who have achieved academic excellence. Academic honors are based on a student’s cumulative GPA. Please note that the honors listed in this program are estimated based on grades posted as of March 14, 2024.\n\nThe official academic honors earned will be posted on the transcript and noted on the diploma. The following symbols are used in this commencement program to distinguish the various academic honors:\n\nStudents who submitted a graduation application after March 13, 2024, may not appear in this publication. The following list of students is not an official record that all candidates have been awarded degrees nor is this list an official order of students in attendance of Regis University’s commencement ceremonies."
