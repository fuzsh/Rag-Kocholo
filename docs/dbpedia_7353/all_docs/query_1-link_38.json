        "text": "NORTH PLATTE, Neb. (KNOP) - A Panhandle man was sentenced for falsification of financial reports in federal court.\n\nUnited States Attorney Susan Lehr announced that Jacob Wilkins, 43, of Mitchell, Nebraska, was sentenced on July 31 in federal court in Lincoln for two counts of falsification of annual financial reports filed by a labor union.\n\nSenior United States District Judge John M. Gerrard sentenced Wilkins to five years of probation. Wilkins will also have to serve 10 weekends in jail. Wilkins has also been ordered to pay $21,381.82 in restitution to the National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 1836. Prior to sentencing, Wilkins paid $2,316.39 in restitution back to the union.\n\nWilkins served as president of the National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 1836 union out of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, from 2001 until he resigned in August 2021. As the union’s president, Wilkins was required by Federal law to keep bank statements and supporting documentation such as receipts and invoices that would justify spending union money. The president and secretary-treasurer annually file an accounting statement with the Department of Labor documenting annual losses, assets, liabilities, receipts and disbursements.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2020, Wilkins used union funds for personal expenses totaling $23,698.21. The embezzlement came to light in 2021 when other union members noticed union funds being used for expenses that were not approved by the union, and that were not union-related purchases.\n\nWilkins admitted he used union funds for personal expenses, could not remember how he spent cash withdrawals from the union checking account, and admitted he did not obtain consent from union members before spending union money. Wilkins admitted he stopped keeping records showing how he used union funds as of 2010.\n\n“There are consequences for individuals who breach the trust placed in them to be good stewards of union funds. Jacob Wilkins embezzled $23,698.21 from National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 1836 that should have been used for its members’ benefit,” Christiane Abendroth, District Director, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Labor-Management Standards, said. “OLMS is committed to holding accountable anyone who unlawfully exploits their position for financial gain at the expense of their fellow union members.”\n\nThis case was investigated by the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Labor-Management Standards."
