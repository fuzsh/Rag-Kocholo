        "text": "“ Shortly after winning my grant, I found out a widely-recognized academic neurosurgical oncologist – who I greatly admired – had reviewed my proposal and he gave me personal feedback. It was an honor and also pointed to how the academic neurosurgical community invested a great amount of time in this program. Looking at the alumni of the NREF research fellowship is like looking at an academic neurosurgery honor roll. The study I initiated details characteristics and career outcomes of the NREF recipients, highlights how important this grant process has been in supporting the creation of surgeon scientists. “\n\nAnaliz Rodriguez, MD, PhD, 2013-14 NREF Cerebrovascular Section Research Fellowship Grant\n\nVijay Agarwal, MD\n\nZarina S.

I have been very fortunate with the trajectory of my career, and I have the NREF to thank. The NREF provides funding to students and early investigators that leads to great discoveries. Today, I support the NREF not only with my Cushing Circle donations, but also by directing great students to apply for the Medical Student Summer Research Fellowship. It’s the ‘circle of life’. “\n\nG.
