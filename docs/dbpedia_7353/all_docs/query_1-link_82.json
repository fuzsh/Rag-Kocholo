        "text": "Liverpool and England football legend Steven Gerrard has donated £10,000 to the GoFundMe page set up for the victims of the Southport stabbings this week.\n\nThe fundraising page was created by dance groups across the UK to support the families impacted by the horrific attack in Southport, where three young girls tragically lost their lives. The victims, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, were killed in the heartbreaking incident that took place at the Hart Space on Hart Street in Southport on Monday, July 29.\n\nThe stabbings occurred during a Taylor Swift dance class held at the venue. 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana from Banks, Lancashire, has been charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder following the attacks. The local community has rallied together to support the families of the victims, leaving thousands of tributes at the scene and The Atkinson arts venue, filled with messages of love and hope.\n\nSeveral GoFundMe pages have also been launched to aid the family and friends of the victims. Taylor Swift fans set up a fundraising page, stating they were collaborating with Alder Hey Children's Hospital to help raise funds for the families affected by the tragedy, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nPre-school dance companies across the UK are rallying together, launching fundraising efforts to support the victims of the devastating Southport stabbing incident. Football legend Steven Gerrard, who now manages Saudi club Al-Ettifaq and has strong ties to Southport, has generously donated a hefty £10,000 to the cause.\n\nThe current total stands at £63,670, edging closer to the £75,000 goal. In a heartfelt response to the tragedy, American pop icon Taylor Swift took to Instagram earlier this week, expressing her deep sorrow: \"The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously, and I'm just completely in shock.\n\n\"The loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families and the first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to those families.\""
