        "text": "And he is likely to prefer some young players when he takes charge of the national team against the Republic of Ireland on September 7 and Finland at Wembley three days later.\n\nHere are seven youngsters he could turn to.\n\nCole Palmer\n\nChelsea star Palmer was one of the stars of that Under-21 campaign, and showed he is ready for the next level at the Euros in Germany, scoring in the final against Spain.\n\nAnthony Gordon\n\nThe second member of that Under-21 squad to step up for Euro 2024, Gordon’s versatility could work to his benefit.\n\nCurtis Jones\n\nJones of Liverpool narrowly missed out on a Euro 2024 call-up. He was part of Southgate's provisional squad, only to then be cut when 33 became 26.\n\nHarvey Elliott\n\nLiverpool’s Elliott is another who could be knocking on the door with a strong start. The former Fulham man has made an impact in central midfield or in a more advanced role.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite\n\nEverton ace Branthwaite was in England's provisional Euros squad but was unlucky not to make the final 26 after Harry Maguire was ruled out through injury.\n\nLevi Colwill\n\nChelsea star Colwill is a left-footed centre-back who has looked comfortable against tough opponents.\n\nJacob Ramsey\n\nThe Aston Villa man could stake claim for a place, having played for Carsley at Under-21 level.\n\nAnd while we’re at it, here’s another… I bet very few of you have narrowed it down to the same couple of candidates as me.\n\nIf the odds are spot-on, finding Gareth Southgate’s replacement is a toss-up between Eddie Howe and Graham Potter.\n\nWell in my book it’s a straight head-to-head, too. But I’m even more convinced that the men I see as obvious front-runners will be lucky to even get an interview.\n\nI doubt there are many who’d agree with me either, when I say the FA should look no further than Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard for the next Three Lions boss.\n\nEither of them could do the job standing on their head, yet probably neither will get so much as a phone call.\n\nMind you, plenty of people will insist there’s no reason why they should because they’ve already written off both as failures.\n\nForgetting that Frank reached an FA Cup final and finished fourth in his first spell at Chelsea.\n\nOr the fact that Everton were in such a mess, he never had a prayer when he went there.\n\nThere’s every chance they’ll gloss over Stevie’s time at Rangers, despite their first title win in a decade — unbeaten as well — and say he was a flop at Aston Villa.\n\nBut you show me a manager who’s not had a tough time of it somewhere down the line. Potter certainly did at Chelsea — he only lasted 31 games and lost 11 of them.\n\nSo did Unai Emery, the man who replaced Stevie as boss at Villa, when he was Arsenal manager. It happens to everyone out there.\n\nSo what’s the difference between Potter and Frank?\n\nWhy is one an obvious candidate for England, yet the other not even worthy of a mention?\n\nNothing against Eddie or Graham, by the way. Eddie’s doing well enough at Newcastle without absolutely tearing it up.\n\nAnd Potter did a good job at Brighton before Chelsea but he had good recruitment and was working with good players.\n\nLook at some of the names he had and where they ended up.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister won the World Cup and went to Liverpool. Leandro Trossard is at Arsenal, Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo joined Chelsea, Yves Bissouma is with Tottenham.\n\nThere’s no doubt Potter or Howe would be a safe pair of hands. A steady Eddie. Just like Gareth was eight years ago — which is why they will probably get a chance.\n\nBut if the FA want someone steeped in football knowledge — at international level too — and who knows the game inside out at that level, both Frank and Stevie leave them standing.\n\nThe players would love it as well. They’d be desperate to play for them.\n\nThey would have nothing but respect whether it was Lampard or Gerrard as boss.\n\nSo, are they both on the scrapheap for good because they’ve had a failure somewhere down the line? There won’t be any managers left before long if that’s all it takes.\n\nAnd here’s another thing as well. While you need a thick skin to be a club manager, it’s not a patch on the one demanded at international level.\n\nThat goes for players — certainly the senior ones — as well. And Stevie and Frank could tell you all about that better than most.\n\nSome of the stuff Frank had to put up with back in the day was horrendous, horrible stuff.\n\nIt was the same for Gerro, especially when he was captain.\n\nBut the pair of them stood up and came through it. And that’s the sort of character you want and need as England manager.\n\nIt’s not about being a fantastic coach. When do you really get the chance to prove that with England? You don’t.\n\nYou’re not out there every day doing shape, shadow play and the like. For one thing you tend to pick the team at the last minute because you don’t want it leaking out!\n\nIt’s about managing, not coaching and there is a difference. It’s about picking the best players in the right positions.\n\nIt’s about attacking and being positive — and in my book, nothing would be more positive than giving Stevie or Frank a call.\n\nBut I’d be very surprised if anyone at the FA even picks up the phone and dials their numbers."
