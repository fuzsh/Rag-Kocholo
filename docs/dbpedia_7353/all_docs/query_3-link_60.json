        "text": "With the sudden announcement that Akbar Al Baker, CEO Qatar Airways, will step down with two weeks’ notice, prior to Emirates boss Sir Tim Clark's imminent retirement, John Grant compares the main operating metrics of each company under their respective leaders. Writing for AGBI - Arabian Gulf Business Insight, John returns to 1997 when Qatar Airways was a small airline operating 730,000 seats per annum, with a mixed fleet of A300's and B727s, and Emirates had 5.9 million seats per annum, operating a network that covered all the major European markets and extended as far as Melbourne. How did these two #airlines reach such capacity and strength under their individual leadership teams, and what is the future now these two stalwarts are heading into retirement opportunities as airlines, suppliers, and governments compete for their advisory services? Read the full article at https://lnkd.in/edWxQtQP\n\nFrom Humble Beginnings to Global Leadership: The Vision and Courage of Qatar Airways The journey of Qatar Airways is a powerful testament to visionary leadership, unwavering courage, and relentless pursuit of excellence. From its modest beginnings in 1993 with a fleet of just 5 aircraft, Qatar Airways has soared to new heights, now boasting an impressive 254 aircraft in 2024. This remarkable transformation is not just a story of numerical growth but a profound reflection of our vision, resilience, and commitment to being a global aviation leader. #The Visionary Foundation The inception of Qatar Airways was marked by a bold vision—to connect the world through superior service and unparalleled connectivity. In 1993, the foundation was laid with a clear mission: to redefine the standards of aviation. This vision was driven by an understanding that the airline industry was not just about transportation but about creating experiences that resonate with passengers. #Courage in Adversity The path to success was never easy. The airline industry is fraught with challenges, from economic downturns to geopolitical tensions. Yet, Qatar Airways faced these adversities with courage and a proactive approach. By investing in cutting-edge technology, expanding our fleet with the latest aircraft, and continuously enhancing our service quality, we turned challenges into opportunities. This courage to innovate and adapt has been pivotal in our journey from a small regional airline to a global powerhouse. #Commitment to Excellence Central to our growth has been an unwavering commitment to excellence. Every aspect of Qatar Airways' operations reflects this commitment—be it our world-class in-flight services, state-of-the-art facilities, or the meticulous care we take in maintaining our fleet. Our dedication to exceeding passenger expectations has earned us numerous accolades and a loyal customer base worldwide. #Inspiring the Future The transformation of Qatar Airways is a source of inspiration for all who believe in the power of vision and perseverance. It demonstrates that with clear goals, strategic planning, and the courage to face challenges head-on, extraordinary achievements are possible. The journey of Qatar Airways from 5 to 254 aircraft is more than just a numerical growth; it is a reflection of our core values—vision, courage, and excellence. It is a story that inspires and motivates us to continue striving for greatness, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of the global aviation industry. **#VisionaryLeadership #AviationExcellence #QatarAirwaysJourney #Inspiration #GlobalAviation #ExcellenceInFlight #LeadershipInAviation #AviationSuccess #FutureOfAviation #InnovationInFlight #AviationPioneers**#qatarjobs #qatarvist #qatarrealestate #businessconsulting #qatarairways\n\nLufthansa CEO Jens Ritter took a rare and commendable step by working as a flight attendant for a day. He joined the flight crew as a temporary cabin crew member on a flight from Frankfurt to Riyadh and Bahrain. Ritter said that he wanted to experience the challenges faced by flight attendants firsthand and to better understand the needs of passengers. He also said that he wanted to show his appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the Lufthansa cabin crew. I believe that such initiatives can help managers make better decisions by giving them a real sense of customer interaction and the challenges faced by front-line or operational-level employees. It is an example of servant leadership, which is a leadership style that focuses on serving others and putting the needs of employees and customers first. Not to mention the positive impact that this can have on the morale of his team, as they will know that their boss appreciates their hard work and understands the challenges they face. This can help to build trust and respect between the CEO and the employees. I am sure that he will make different decisions in the office from now on. #leadership #airtransport #lufthansa"
