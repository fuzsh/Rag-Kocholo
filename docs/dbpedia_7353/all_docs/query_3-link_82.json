        "text": "IâVE a message for all those who reckon the search for Englandâs next manager is a two-horse race â youâre bang on!\n\nAnd while weâre at it, hereâs another...âI bet very few of you have narrowed it down to the same couple of candidates as me.\n\nIf the odds are spot-on, finding Gareth Southgateâs replacement is a toss-up between Eddie Howe and Graham Potter.\n\nWell in my book itâs a straight head-to-head, too. But Iâm even more convinced that the men I see as obvious front-runners will be lucky to even get an interview.\n\nI doubt there are many whoâd agree with me either, when I say the FA should look no further than Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard for the next Three Lions boss.\n\nEither of them could do the job standing on their head, yet probably neither will get so much as a phone call.\n\nMind you, plenty of people will insist thereâs no reason why they should because theyâve already written off both as failures.\n\nForgetting that Frank reached an FA Cup final and finished fourth in his first spell at Chelsea.\n\nOr the fact that Everton were in such a mess, he never had a prayer when he went there.\n\nThereâs every chance theyâll gloss over Stevieâs time at Rangers, despite their first title win in a decade â unbeaten as well â and say he was a flop at Aston Villa.\n\nBut you show me a manager whoâs not had a tough time of it somewhere down the line. Potter certainly did at Chelsea â he only lasted 31 games and lost 11 of them.\n\nSo did Unai Emery, the man who replaced Stevie as boss at Villa, when he was Arsenal manager. It happens to everyone out there.\n\nSo whatâs the difference between Potter and Frank?\n\nWhy is one an obvious candidate for England, yet the other not even worthy of a mention?\n\nNothing against Eddie or Graham, by the way. Eddieâs doing well enough at Newcastle without absolutely tearing it up.\n\nAnd Potter did a good job at Brighton before Chelsea but he had good recruitment and was working with good players.\n\nLook at some of the names he had and where they ended up.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister won the World Cup and went to Liverpool. Leandro Trossard is at Arsenal, Marc Cucurella and Moises Caicedo joined Chelsea, Yves Bissouma is with Tottenham.\n\nThereâs no doubt Potter or Howe would be a safe pair of hands. A steady Eddie. Just like Gareth was eight years ago â which is why they will probably get a chance.\n\nBut if the FA want someone steeped in football knowledge â at international level too â and who knows the game inside out at that level, both Frank and Stevie leave them standing.\n\nThe players would love it as well. Theyâd be desperate to play for them.\n\nThey would have nothing but respect whether it was Lampard or Gerrard as boss.\n\nSo, are they both on the scrapheap for good because theyâve had a failure somewhere down the line? There wonât be any managers left before long if thatâs all it takes.\n\nAnd hereâs another thing as well. While you need a thick skin to be a club manager, itâs not a patch on the one demanded at international level.\n\nThat goes for players â certainly the senior ones â as well. And Stevie and Frank could tell you all about that better than most.\n\nSome of the stuff Frank had to put up with back in the day was horrendous, horrible stuff.\n\nIt was the same for Gerro, especially when he was captain.\n\nBut the pair of them stood up and came through it. And thatâs the sort of character you want and need as England manager.\n\nItâs not about being a fantastic coach. When do you really get the chance to prove that with England? You donât.\n\nYouâre not out there every day doing shape, shadow play and the like. For one thing you tend to pick the team at the last minute because you donât want it leaking out!\n\nItâs about managing, not coaching and there is a difference. Itâs about picking the best players in the right positions.\n\nItâs about attacking and being positive â and in my book, nothing would be more positive than giving Stevie or Frank a call.\n\nBut Iâd be very surprised if anyone at the FA even picks up the phone and dials their numbers.\n\nSouthgate successor must be right\n\nBy Phil Thomas\n\nIN the week when a high-profile resignation letter has been headline news, picture this scenario for a second.\n\nAfter four years as governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey decides he has had enough and walks away.\n\nAs one of the highest-profile positions in Britain, finding the perfect replacement is imperative.\n\nIt is an appointment that will have far-reaching effects on the entire nation, so there is no margin for error. Quite simply it MUST be the right person.\n\nSo, as the door to the boardroom swings open, in come the two men who will have the final say on picking the ideal candidate...âHarry Kane and Jude Bellingham.\n\nThe pair of them in full kit, still muddied and sweating from the training ground, plonking themselves down ready to grill the waiting queue of applicants.\n\nSee what I mean about an imaginary scenario?\n\nBecause of course it could never happen in real life.\n\nSpecialist appointments can only be made by those qualified to pass judgement.\n\nIt would be ludicrous, clearly.\n\nKane and Bellingham may be gifted footballers with stardust in their boots but bring little to this particular party.\n\nIt would demand someone from a financial background.\n\nSomeone qualified for the job. Anything else would be folly, totally laughable.\n\nCouldnât happen. Any more than if, for example, you were looking to fill the highest profile sporting role in football, if that suddenly became vacant.\n\nYou wouldnât turn to men whose expertise was, say, in the commercial or marketing sectors.\n\nYouâd want someone steeped in football knowledge.\n\nOnly when push comes to shove, it doesnât actually work like that after all. That became evident the moment Gareth Southgateâs âI quitâ letter landed on the FAâs doormat.\n\nThe second when we discovered the men who are charged with making the most important domestic football appointment in eight years.\n\nChief executive Mark Bullinghamâââandâââtechnicalâââdirector John McDermott are the kingmakers within the FA who will make the call.\n\nSo come on then.\n\nHow many out there would be able to pick them out of a line-up?\n\nHow many out there could tell you the first thing about them?\n\nWould you, for example, need Google to tell you McDermott joined the FA in 2020, after 15 years as Tottenhamâs head of academy coaching and player development?\n\nWould you know without the internetâs help that Bullingham is the former director of marketing at the Americaâs Cup, who arrived initially as the new commercial chief?\n\nWould you recognise either if they walked past you in the street?\n\nMost probably you wouldnât have a clue even if they were wearing name tags.\n\nBoth of them on big fees, talking about the system and the process and the DNA of understanding English football.\n\nLiving in their FA bubble, unknown and faceless to the football fans of the nation, and now charged with making a massive decision.\n\nLook, picking the national manager has never been an easy task.\n\nThere has never been a unanimous choice.\n\nAdmittedly there would have been if Brian Clough had ever got the call, but that was as likely to happen as I was to make it.\n\nBut at least when the likes of Jimmy Armfield or Trevor Brooking were involved, youâd accept it a little more. Men you first knew as players, as internationals themselves, in Jimmyâs case 15 times as England skipper.\n\nNot as people who you could argue are as likely to be swayed by stats and facts from a laptop, rather than hands-on experience and know-how.\n\nYou might not agree with their decisions, but you certainly never questioned their right and capability to make them.\n\nNot like with McDermott and certainly Bullingham, arguably the most awkward-looking man in a tracksuit ever.\n\nIt doesnât mean the decision they make will definitely be wrong when they discuss the merits of candidates Graham Potter, Eddie Howe and Lee Carsley.\n\nYou wouldnât admire them any less if they had the b******s to take a gamble and go foreign, not with an obvious Poch-style appointment, but a Marcelo Bielsa or Nestor Lorenzo.\n\nBut neither would you risk too much on them making the right call in the first place."
