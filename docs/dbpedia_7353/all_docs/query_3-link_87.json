        "text": "Everton’s historic final season at Goodison Park is now just a fortnight away and the transfer deadline passes before the end of this month. But even though his side had just been beaten 3-0 in a friendly at Coventry City, Sean Dyche was able to raise a smile when asked about the prospect of further new faces.\n\nThose who have viewed the post-match Sky Sports interview with Vinny O’Connor at the CBS Arena will have seen the jocular approach the Blues boss was taking when laughing off suggestions that Jake O’Brien had been brought in as a replacement for Jarrad Branthwaite.\n\nBut let’s just hope he’s still smiling and ‘The Carlisle Kaiser’ is still wearing a royal blue jersey when Bournemouth come to Goodison on August 31, the day after the window shuts.\n\nWhen asked by the ECHO whether he anticipated any more players to follow the quintet he has already acquired throughout this window, Dyche said: “I don’t think so with the finances that we have got, or haven’t, as the case may be. But we will have to wait and see.”\n\nThe teasing answer seem to draw upon a couple of factors. The first was the collapse of the Friedkin Group’s takeover of Everton with the announcement that a fourth period of exclusivity with a prospective buyer in two years without wantaway majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri disposing of his 94.1% stake in the club with money owed to a previous would-be custodian, 777 Partners, cited as the factor that prompted the Roma owner to pull the plug.\n\nWhile being told by Moshiri that 777 were “the best partners to take our great club forward” when he struck the doomed deal last September, ahead of the Miami-based private investment firm’s attempts to seek Premier League approval that were protracted for the lion’s share of the traumatic 2023/24 season, once they were out of the picture, it was refreshing to see the amount of attention Everton received from less controversial interested parties earlier this summer.\n\nHowever, a fortnight on from high-flier Friedkin’s failure to take off – the Texas-based tycoon is currently ranked at number 262 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $9.6billion (£7.5bn) – the silence is currently deafening when it comes any official wording from potential buyers.\n\nAhead of Everton’s final home match of last season against Sheffield United, Dyche predicted that if there was no takeover at the club this summer, his own job would go from being like “juggling sand” to “juggling dust.” So far, this window he and director of football Kevin Thelwell have been able to use their proverbial buckets and spades to build a construction that looks to have fairly solid foundations. But when on the beach you always have to be wary of the tide coming in and ruining such hard work or even the perils of a boisterous dog running past and kicking everything up in the air.\n\nFor the Blues in the Premier League, that would be manifested by someone coming in between now and the deadline for one of their prized assets, which could be the second factor. Thelwell made it clear that a sustainable football model has to be built on astute trading, in and out of the club, and while the ‘fire sale’ predicted by some never materialised, Everton aren’t quite out of the woods yet.\n\nAmadou Onana, who joined Aston Villa for £50million, was always going to be the most palatable sale among Goodison Park’s big names but as well as sticking to their guns over Branthwaite, the club’s resolve over Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose personal situation is far less straightforward that that of the centre-back, could be tested.\n\nManchester United, who have already lost new £52million defender Leny Yoro to a foot injury that is expected to keep him sidelined for three months, could now come back in with a third bid for the 22-year-old England international after having derisory offers of £35million plus add-ons and £45million plus add-ons rejected.\n\nEverton’s number nine who, unlike recent summers, has been playing regularly throughout their friendlies – and missing a hatful of golden opportunities to score (always better to get that out of your system in pre-season) – has of course now entered the final 12 months of his current contract and there is no sign of the deal being signed, especially while the ownership issue remains unresolved.\n\nAlthough some of those within Goodison’s corridors of power are understood to be loathed to miss out on a potential transfer fee for the striker, others feel trying to get a quick buck out of one of just four players who have broken the 50-goal barrier for the Blues in the Premier League era at what won’t be his full market value, could leave the team dangerously light of firepower and given what’s at stake this season, it would actually be a more prudent move to risk losing him for nothing next summer.\n\nAs we saw back in late June when Newcastle United were desperate to do deals in search of PSR compliance, even hawking around their Player of the Season Anthony Gordon, Everton have been prepared to go to the negotiating table over the Sheffield-born star if they think there is a deal to be had, with the potential part-exchange involving Yankubah Minteh, who wanted to join the Blues but ended up at Brighton & Hove Albion instead.\n\nThe general consensus is that with the aforementioned Onana having been sold and Andre Gomes let go, even with Tim Iroegbunam having gone in the opposite direction of the Belgian, Dyche’s squad is still probably a body light in the centre of the park.\n\nPerhaps, Manchester City’s Kalvin Phillips, who the manager is a long-term admirer of, and of whom there is interest could fill the hole? Maybe, but the former Leeds United man is the sort of player who would have benefitted from coming in earlier and being put through the two ‘Gaffer’s Days’ Everton’s players have been given this summer along with several other heavy sessions."
