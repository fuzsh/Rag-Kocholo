        "text": "Theories of Forgetting\n\n(FC2, 2014)\n\nIn Theories of Forgetting, Lance Olsen’s 12th novel and 25th book, he may have brought off the boldest departure of a career dedicated to such takeoffs. The formatting allows the text to be read in either direction, each featuring different fonts. The same arrangement exists for the photos and images, and then there’s the marginalia, presented in blue cursive. These comments eventually address the events unfolding both forwards and backwards. The content too covers new ground for Olsen. His last three novels, Nietzsche’s Kisses (2006), Head in Flames (2009), and Calendar of Regrets (2010), were set in Europe, and were to some degree historical novels. These helped him win both a Guggenheim and a fellowship with the American Academy in Berlin. Theories, however, is entirely contemporary and its home ground couldn’t be more American. This is Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty, “earth-art” from 1970, located in Utah’s Great Basin. Both the novel’s primary stories, and its marginalia as well, reveal roots in conservative Salt Lake and far-out aesthetics, and though connections hardly emerge with perfect clarity, we do come to understand. We know a family breakdown when we see it. Some of the damage is done by a trope out of science fiction, a mysterious new plague; some appears to be old-fashioned paranoid schizophrenia—or, even older, sibling rivalry. In any case, this vision of the fall proves no less than unique.\n\nMore details come to light in the interview below, which Olsen and I conducted via email. He and I know each other a bit through writing circles; I’ve reviewed one earlier novel, and he was kind enough to provide a blurb for my forthcoming selected criticism, The Sea-God’s Herb. This spring, as the questions and answers took shape, we decided to forego the pretense of live conversation. Since the subject was so rare a text, why should we come across as anything but text, ourselves?"
