        "text": "American politician (born 1951)\n\nFor the astronomer, see Debra Fischer.\n\nDebra Lynelle Fischer (née Strobel; born March 1, 1951)[1] is an American politician and former educator serving as the senior United States senator from Nebraska, a seat she has held since 2013. A member of the Republican Party, Fischer is the third woman to represent Nebraska in the U.S. Senate (after Eva Bowring and Hazel Abel) and the first to be reelected.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2004, Fischer served on the Valentine Rural High School Board of Education. In 2004, she was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 43rd district for two terms. Fischer ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and was initially seen as a long-shot candidate, but pulled off an unexpected victory against state attorney general Jon Bruning in the Republican primary; in the general election, she defeated former Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and was the only Republican to flip a Senate seat in the 2012 elections. In 2015, she became the state's senior U.S. senator after Mike Johanns retired.\n\nEarly life, education, and career\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer was born Debra Lynelle Strobel on March 1, 1951, in Lincoln, Nebraska. She is the daughter of Florence M. (née Bock) and Gerold Carl Strobel.[2][3] Her father was the State Engineer/Director of the Nebraska Department of Roads under Governors Kay Orr and Ben Nelson and her mother was an elementary school teacher with Lincoln Public Schools.[2]\n\nIn 1972, Strobel married Bruce Fischer, from Valentine, Nebraska; she had met him at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.[2][3] She and her husband raised three sons on the Fischer family cattle ranch south of Valentine.[2][3] In 1987, she returned to the university and completed her B.S. degree in education.[3]\n\nSchool board (1990–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, Fischer was elected to the Valentine Rural High School Board of Education, serving until 2004. Governor Mike Johanns appointed Fischer as a Commissioner to the Nebraska Coordinating Commission for Post-Secondary Education from 2000 to 2004.[4]\n\nNebraska Legislature (2005–2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, Fischer ran for the Nebraska Legislature from the 43rd legislative district in the state's Sandhills region. In the nonpartisan primary, she came in second in a field of seven, receiving 2226 votes (25.1%); front-runner Kevin T. Cooksley received 2264 votes (25.5%). In the general election, she defeated Cooksley with 8178 votes to his 8050, for a margin of 50.4%–49.6%.[5]\n\nIn 2008, she won re-election unopposed.[6] Nebraska's term-limits law precluded her running for re-election in 2012.[7]\n\nTenure\n\nFischer's district was geographically the largest in the Nebraska Legislature, comprising 12 counties and part of a 13th.[8] During her tenure in the legislature, she did a weekly radio show on seven stations covering her district, and wrote a weekly column printed in several newspapers.[9]\n\nIn 2007, Fischer helped lead a filibuster against a bill to create a statewide smoking ban for indoor workplaces and public places. Commonly known as the Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act, the bill eventually passed and was signed into law in 2008.[10]\n\nIn 2009, Fischer was one of fourteen co-sponsors of L.B. 675, which required abortion providers to display ultrasound images of the fetus at least one hour prior to the abortions, in a position where the abortion seeker could easily view them. A spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee stated that the Nebraska law was stronger than those of other states, which only required that the client be asked if she wanted to see an ultrasound image. The measure passed by a 40–5 vote, and was signed into law by Governor Dave Heineman.[11]\n\nFischer served as chairwoman for the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee[12] and helped pass the BUILD Nebraska Act through the Unicameral. This bill prioritized a quarter cent of the state sales tax for infrastructure projects.[13]\n\nU.S. Senate (2013–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\n2012\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary\n\nIn January 2012, after incumbent Democratic Senator Ben Nelson announced his retirement, Fischer officially announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate.[14] The Republican primary campaign was expected to be a battle between Attorney General Jon Bruning and State Treasurer Don Stenberg; Fischer and three less well-known candidates were also on the ballot.[15][16]\n\nDuring the campaign, environmentalists and others criticized Fischer because her family's ranch near Valentine grazed cattle on federal land, leasing it for about $110,000 per year less than the market rate on private land. Opponents of federal grazing leases argued that she should relinquish her family's permit if she wanted to remain \"morally consistent\" with her message of less government. Fischer argued that the poor quality of federal lands and the restrictions that come with federal leases make it inappropriate to compare them to private leases.[17]\n\nDuring the campaign, Fischer was outspent by Bruning, who raised $3.6 million, and Stenberg, who spent $865,000. Fischer's campaign raised only $440,000. But Bruning and Stenberg spent much of their resources attacking one another; Fischer benefited from the damage that each did to the other's reputation. She was also aided by $725,000 in TV ads the Club for Growth bought attacking Bruning. Shortly before the election, she was endorsed by Nebraska U.S. Representative Jeff Fortenberry and by 2008 Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who recorded robocalls endorsing her; and a super PAC financed by former Omaha businessman Joe Ricketts paid for $250,000 worth of TV ads promoting Fischer and opposing Bruning.[15][18]\n\nFischer won the primary with 40% of the vote to Bruning's 35% and Stenberg's 18%. She took a plurality of votes in 75 of Nebraska's 93 counties. Bruning won 15 counties and Schuyler businessman Pat Flynn received a plurality in his home Colfax County. Fischer and Bruning tied in Kimball and Sioux counties.[16][19]\n\nGeneral election\n\nIn the general election, Fischer faced Democratic nominee Bob Kerrey, a former Nebraska governor and U.S. senator who was running for the seat he had held from 1989 to 2001.\n\nDuring the campaign, Kerrey ran ads accusing Fischer of unprincipled conduct in the matter of a 1995 adverse possession suit, whereby the Fischers had attempted to obtain title to 104 acres (42 ha) of land adjoining their property.[20] Fischer maintained that their intent in filing the suit was to obtain a more manageable boundary for their ranch after repeated attempts to purchase the land had failed; according to an Omaha World-Herald analysis, the Kerrey campaign's statements about Fischer's actions in the Legislature failed to mention her support for a compromise measure that would have allowed NGPC to buy the land.[21] A Fischer spokesman accused Kerrey of \"reckless disregard for the truth\" and \"gutter politics\" in the matter.[20]\n\nFischer defeated Kerrey, 58%–42%. She won mainly by swamping Kerrey in the state's rural areas. She won 88 of Nebraska's 93 counties. Kerrey won only Douglas, Lancaster, Saline, Thurston, and Dakota Counties.[22]\n\n2018\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 2018, defeating Democratic nominee Jane Raybould by a significant margin.[23]\n\n2024\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer is running for reelection in 2024.[24] She defeated Arron Kowalski in the Republican primary election in May. She faces independent candidate Dan Osborn, a former union leader, in the November general election.[25]\n\nTenure\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer became the third female U.S. Senator in Nebraska's history, and the first since 1954.[26][27] She was the first elected to a full term: of the earlier woman Senators, Eva Bowring was appointed in 1954 to occupy the seat vacated by the death of Dwight Griswold until a special election could be held to replace him later that year;[28] Hazel Abel won that special election to finish Griswold's term, but did not seek a full term.[29]\n\nFischer has expressed support for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution limiting senators to two six-year terms and representatives to three two-year terms. She pledged to \"limit herself to two terms in office\". She further stated that members of the U.S. Congress should be placed under a lifetime ban from becoming federally registered lobbyists.[30][better source needed]\n\nCommittee assignments\n\n[edit]\n\nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n\nSubcommittee on Livestock, Marketing, and Agriculture Security\n\nCommittee on Armed Services\n\nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities\n\nSubcommittee on Readiness and Management Support\n\nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces (Ranking Member)\n\nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation\n\nSubcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security\n\nSubcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion\n\nSubcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance\n\nSubcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard\n\nSubcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security (Ranking Member)\n\nCommittee on Rules and Administration\n\nSelect Committee on Ethics[31][32]\n\nPolitical positions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe American Conservative Union's Center for Legislative Accountability gave Fischer a lifetime rating of 81.12 as of 2021.[33] The politically liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave her a 2019 score of 0%.[34]\n\nClimate change\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer rejects conclusions by the international scientific community that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming in recent decades. In May 2015, a legislative aide said, \"the senator acknowledges the climate is changing but believes it is due to natural cycles.\"[35][36]\n\nGun access\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Fischer said any legislative proposals to restrict people on the terrorist watchlist from buying guns would not stop mass shootings. She said that preventing self-radicalization was more important than restricting gun access.[37]\n\nBorder control\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer supports sending more troops to patrol the United States-Mexico border and opposes college benefits for undocumented immigrants.[38][better source needed]\n\nLGBTQ rights\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2020, Fischer expressed support for the Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County that \"extended Civil Rights Act protections to gay, lesbian and transgender workers\", saying, \"It's important that we recognize that all Americans have equal rights under our Constitution. I'm fine with it.\"[39]\n\n2020 presidential election\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the January 6, 2021, United States Electoral College vote count, Fischer announced that she would vote to certify the election results.[40] Fischer was on Capitol Hill to participate in the count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. During the attack, Fischer tweeted that \"These rioters have no constitutional right to harm law enforcement and storm our Capitol. We are a nation of laws, not some banana republic. This must end now.\"[41]\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Fischer voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[42]\n\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[43]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nFischer and her husband, Bruce, operate a family ranch, Sunny Slope Ranch, near Valentine, Nebraska. Their adult sons Adam, Morgan, and Luke own the majority of the stock in the family corporation, while the elder Fischers retain a minority share. In 2020, Fischer and her husband moved to Lincoln, Nebraska.[44]\n\nElectoral history\n\n[edit]\n\n2012 U.S. Senate primary election results, Nebraska[45] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 195,043 100\n\n2012 U.S. Senate general election results, Nebraska[46] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 788,572 100.0% N/A Republican gain from Democratic\n\n2018 U.S. Senate primary election results, Nebraska[47] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 169,094 100%\n\n2018 U.S. Senate general election results, Nebraska[48] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 698,883 100% N/A Republican hold\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nWomen in the United States Senate\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Sen.
