In 1995, Gerrard became the youngest appointee ever to the Nebraska Supreme Court when Gov. Ben Nelson appointed the 41-year-old. He left the court earlier this year when the U.S. Senate confirmed Gerrard’s nomination to the federal bench.

Prior to becoming a Supreme Court justice, Gerrard was in private practice in Norfolk, and he also served as city attorney for Battle Creek.
