        "text": "The strategic planning of the Inter-American Organization for Higher Education (IOHE) for the for the period of 2017-2022 began April 21, 2016, with the development of the Appreciative Inquiry Workshop and the LXXV Board of Directors Meeting, held the following day. Both events took place at the Royal Roads University (RRU).in Victoria, Canada.\n\nThese meetings have established the way forward in the planning stage, under the leadership of the President of this Organization, Dr. Allan Cahoon, who is also the President of the host institution and Vice-President of the Canadian region, as well as Dr. David Julien, who is the Executive Secretary General.\n\n“Royal Roads University was delighted to host the first Board of Directors meeting of IOHE ever held in BC”, Dr. Cahoon said.\n\nFirstly, during the seminar, the Mission, Vision and Values of the organization were revised and, secondly, the management of the next Plan of Action was defined, taking into account the latest higher education trends. The results of these steps served to establish the IOHE Strategic Orientations of 2017-2022.\n\nThe LXXV Board of Directors Meeting also served as a premise for the preparation of a document which will be systematizing the actions necessary in order to meet the needs expressed by our members. The first draft of the plan will be crafted by referring to the responses of the First Questionnaire of the IOHE Strategic Orientations of 2017-2022. After a second consultation, the document drawn up between May and November will be presented at the next IOHE Board of Directors Meeting, scheduled for November 2016, at the Universidad de Guadalajara, head office of the Vice-President for the Region of Mexico, led by Tonatiuh Bravo Padilla, General President of the institution.\n\n“In these challenging times, it is critical to work together to address the common challenges we face in the post-secondary sector in the Americas”, Dr. Cahoon added. “It was an extremely valuable time to share the successes of IOHE’s programs and impacts as the continent’s leading Association in the Americas”.\n\nThe implementation of the 2011-2016 IOHE Strategic Guidelines comes to an end this year. Between 2011 and 2015 we have achieved significant results in the execution of these Guidelines with, to date, 43 of 45 planned actions implemented during this period."
