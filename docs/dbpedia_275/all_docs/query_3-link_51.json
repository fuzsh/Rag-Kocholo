        "text": "We have a free gift offer for a limited time (lotion or one ounce choose above).\n\nOn this website you will be able to purchase your discontinued fragrance again.\n\nWe specialize in expertly creating scents that smell nearly identical to your discontinued perfume or cologne. So if your favorite fragrance has been pulled from the market, we can help. We have years of experience along with the expertise and technology to create a nearly identical fragrance.\n\nMost of our business is repeat business, but we are accepting new customers on a limited basis.\n\nHere's a few common questions about this process and their answers.\n\nI have a scent I want matched and created, how does this work?\n\nSimply fill out the information above. If you write in your fragrance and we feel that we can't recreate your scent, we will e-mail you and provide a full refund instantly. We've reproduced over 8000 different fragrances though so we've done most of the fragrances that have been discontinued.\n\nWhat is the price?\n\n$69.99 for a 3.4 oz bottle. The 3.4 oz. bottle is known as a large bottle in the fragrance industry. Shipping is a flat rate of $12.00 to anywhere in the United States via UPS Ground.\n\nAre you sure you can match my perfume/cologne?\n\nNo, that's the honest truth. There are also many cases where we feel we made a great match, others agree, but then some people hate it. Scent is a tricky thing that way. So what we do is provide a NO RETURN NEEDED INSTANT REFUND POLICY. Who does that? We do. After being in business for over 10 years we figured out it's the only way to successfully and ethically run this business.\n\nCan I always reorder?\n\nYes we keep your order information on file forever so that we can always provide you the exact same fragrance. Just check Yes next to the box above that says \"Is This A Repeat Order\".\n\nWhat ingredients do you use?\n\nOur philosophy is to provide the minimum number of ingredients to make a terrific fragrance. We also think it's good to be clear about what we put in the bottle. Modern fragrances can contain over 300 ingredients! Why? Through tricks of chemistry it's cheaper to make the fragrance with these chemicals than it is to use straight perfume oils, which are expensive. We have taken a different route.\n\nOur only ingredients are: Fragrance, Perfumer's Alcohol, and Isopropyl Myristate. That's it. They are all regarded as perfectly safe for humans. If you'd like to find out about each ingredient and why it's included you can click HERE.\n\nHow long will the scent last?\n\n12-16 hours depending on the exact ingredients and your body chemistry. All of our fragrances are Eau De Parfum unless you request a weaker strength via e-mail.\n\nIs it illegal to copy a scent?\n\nNo, definitely not! All fragrances are in the public domain, no one can own a scent or a fragrance (imagine if a company owned the scent of vanilla for instance). That said, we realize that a manufacturer's Trademark is valuable so we try to never sell a fragrance that they still want to sell and is not discontinued. We also make every effort to make sure customer's realize they are NOT buying the original fragrance, but rather a scent that is nearly identical but in a completely different bottle.\n\nHow Long Does it Take?\n\nWe ship 99% of our fragrances within 5 business days of when they are ordered. We do find that about 1% of the fragrances ordered are very difficult matches and in those cases we may need up to 3 weeks to match the scent. If you need the fragrance by a certain date it's best if you contact us after ordering so we can make proper accommodations.\n\nWhere do you ship?\n\nCurrently we are only shipping to the United States.\n\nDo you run another discontinued fragrances website?"
