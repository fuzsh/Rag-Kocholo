        "text": "Accounting for architects. Ha/f Climate Design is so thrilled to be supporting the The Royal Architectural Institute Of Canada | L'Institut royal d'architecture du Canada and National Research Council Canada / Conseil national de recherches Canada deliver in-person Life Cycle Assessment workshops to over 1,350 architects across Canada this coming year. Come join us for one-day hands-on workshops to understand how to make decisions that can lead to significant reductions in carbon emissions. We'll also be partnering with local experts in every city to illustrate how these practices can be applied to the varied contexts of the country. This workshop builds on sessions we've been engaged in with practices across the country over the past year. Kael Opie at KPMB Architects kindly shared this testimonial from our session last month: \"We were very pleased to welcome Ha/f Climate Design to our office for an informative workshop on Embodied Carbon and Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment (WBLCA) training. Ha/f's expertise and leadership in the field have significantly influenced our internal embodied carbon guidelines and standards and will help propel us towards more low-carbon architectural practices. We applaud the RAIC and NRC for their embodied carbon training initiative and strongly encourage architects to participate and contribute to our collective environmental responsibility.\" We will be in Ottawa, Toronto, St. Andrews, Regina and Winnipeg this fall, and Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal and Halifax next year. Look forward to seeing you there! Architecture 2030 Ontario Association of Architects Toronto Society of Architects University of Toronto - John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design"
