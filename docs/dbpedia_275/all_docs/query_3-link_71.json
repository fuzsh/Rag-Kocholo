The event celebrated the remarkable achievements of the seven finalists who completed the three-month acceleration program in partnership with MassChallenge and Huawei.\n\nThis year’s event, held in collaboration with various ventures and accelerators, underscored the growth, scope, and diversity of Tanzanian startups, showcasing the promising future of the country’s tech ecosystem.\n\nThis year the telco led accelerator started with 20 startups, and from these, seven finalists emerged: MITz Kits, Afya ya Mnyama, Mkanda Salama, Go Go App, SAB Biomanufacturers, Altitude X, and Makonda Renewable Tech. These finalists embarked on an incredible 3 month journey through workshops, mentorship sessions, and most recently a learning tour in Shenzhen, China, experiencing cutting-edge technology and 5G networks, sparking new ideas and possibilities for Tanzania.\n\nDownload BAO E-MAGAZINE\n\nVodacom Tanzania’s Managing Director, Philip Besiimire, highlighted the significance of this achievement, stating, “Today, we celebrate innovation, hard work, and the bright future of Tanzanian startups. These seven startups have shown that solutions to local challenges lie within our youth, and we are proud to have been a part of their growth. I commend all the finalists and wish them well. The market is ready for your solutions; let’s go make a difference.”\n\nBesiimire emphasized Vodacom Tanzania’s commitment to supporting startups by providing access to local and international industry experts, training, mentorship, partner networks, and M-PESA services. The company believes in creating solutions that are inclusive and accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities, ensuring that innovations benefit all members of society whilst addressing the SDGs.\n\nCoupled with international experience from China and pitch rehearsals with US based Mass Challenge, the 7 startups faced the judges and audience in what was a rigorous and exciting pitching session to present their solutions, following which 3 startups Rose Funja founder of AltituteX, Frank Mussa, Afya Lead Co-Founder and Lusekelo Nkuwi from GO GO App emerged as winners.\n\nFrank Mussa, one of the winners and co-founder at Afya Lead, says, “From the beginning of our innovation journey, we faced many challenges, but with determination and the support of VDA mentorship, we built a strong business foundation.
