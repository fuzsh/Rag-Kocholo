        "text": "Luxury hotels decked out in opulent decor, incredible restaurants featuring delectable cuisine, boutique shopping, and award-winning spa services; it’s no surprise this charming city is at the top of our list for some much-needed girl’s time. Set out on a fun-filled adventure and check out our insider guide on how to plan the perfect spring girls getaway to Victoria BC.\n\nStay\n\nPerched on the edge of Victoria’s Inner Harbour, the luxurious Inn at Laurel Point offers a serene escape from everyday life. Airy rooms give you space to breathe, while glass walls welcome the sun’s warm rays. Relax and enjoy a soak in your marble-ensconced bathroom or simply enjoy the spectacular harbor views from your private patio.\n\nOnce you pull yourself away from your room, go for a swim in the glass-encased indoor pool or lounge on the nearby sundeck in the hotel’s Japanese gardens. Furthermore, the award-winning AURA Waterfront Restaurant + Patio is the perfect setting for dinner with a view. Fresh local fish, produce and herbs are served up daily along with vintage wines and stellar beers sourced locally from the neighborhood. In addition, AURA does a fantastic Tea option with a modern twist that makes for a perfect lazy afternoon paired with views into the shimmering Inner Harbour.\n\nThe elegant Fairmont Empress is another favorite hotel of ours. A renowned local landmark, the grand and historic hotel has hosted celebrities, royalty and guests from around the world and sits steps away from Victoria’s city center along with a slew of cultural attractions.\n\nThe hotel’s redecorated rooms use a warm, rich color palette of brown, taupe, gray and cream to create a classic look with a modern touch inspired by Vancouver Island’s gardens and sea. Combined with a restaurant featuring delightful local cuisine and carefully curated libations, an elegant tea room and a well-appointed 8,000 square foot spa, and you may have a hard time finding a reason to venture off the property grounds.\n\nTaste\n\nA short two minute walk from FRS Clipper’s Victoria terminal, the hidden culinary gem Nourish Kitchen and Café is the perfect spot to grab a late brunch once you have arrived in the city. Feast on the spiced “Sleeping Beauty” oatmeal pancakes, topped with a sweet vanilla bean organic whipped cream and bee pollen sprinkles or the flavorful “Golden benny,” with roasted summer veggies and turmeric cashew hollandaise. (Insider tip: Cap off your meal with a boozy brunch staple, the “Oui! Mimosa”)\n\nClassic French country-style fare meets seasonal, local ingredients to result in sumptuous dishes well worth the wait at the popular bistro Brasserie L’ecole. The restaurant is famed for their mussels and frites…shellfish fans, this is a must-try. If you feel like spending the night on the town, head to the unique, unassuming gastro-speakeasy Little Jumbo for a late night cocktail. The bar’s extensive 15-page drink menu is carefully crafted, and the skilled mixologists will be more than happy to whip up specialty drinks for you.\n\nAnd of course, a visit to Victoria is not complete without giving yourself the royal treatment and experiencing the famous the Fairmont Empress’ Afternoon Tea. More luxurious than presumptuous, the rich, vintage furnishings and delicate William Edwards china filling the Tea Lobby creates a cozy retreat where you can cuddle up with a warm cuppa.\n\nSip on the Empress’ special blend of full-bodied floral black tea while you snack on a three-tiered plate of dainty tea sandwiches and decadent desserts ranging from savory salmon pinwheels to sweet chocolate délice. In addition, the fresh-from-the-oven scones slathered with sweet strawberry preserves and thick Jersey cream are sure to make your mouth water.\n\nSip and Soak\n\nJourney past magnificent mountains, coastal villages, towering old-growth rainforests and sprawling farmlands as you travel 40 minutes outside of Victoria to the heart of Vancouver Island’s wine country on the Cowichan Valley Wine Tour. Sip on generous samples of the region’s award-winning Pinot Gris and medium-bodied reds at three small, family-owned wineries where you will have the opportunity to enjoy a tasty snack of local artisanal cheese and chat with the winemakers.\n\nIf you are looking for something a little more exhilarating, zip through pristine evergreen trees high above the Sooke rainforest on the AdrenaLINE Zipline Adventure Tour. Eight zip lines ranging from 150-1,000 feet long and up to 150 feet high allow you to experience another side of the region with a bird’s eye view of the forest canopy and spectacular mountain and ocean vistas.\n\nAfter a day of exploring, your gal pals can find calm at the new Ritual Nordic Spa in downtown Victoria. The spa brings a contemporary take on an ancient Finnish tradition with an urban wellness center that offers seemingly endless ways to pamper yourself. The perfect place to rest and cleanse your body and mind, the spa features four saunas, a warm Himalayan salt lounge, an indoor cold plunge pool, Nordic showers and outdoor patios. Enhanced wellness offerings include massage treatments as well as a café bar featuring non-alcoholic artisanal beverages as well as local craft beer and snacks.\n\nShop\n\nOf course, a little retail therapy is an essential part of any girl’s weekend. Known for its array of local and independent boutiques, colorful public markets full of locally produced goods and lively shopping centers, Victoria is one of our favorite places find new threads. Fashionistas should be sure to check out the trendy Johnson Street, a hotspot for locals that houses everything from vintage clothing to custom-made bags in restored heritage buildings.\n\nIf the imaginative displays gracing the windows of Violette do not catch your eye, the delicate handmade gold and silver baubles inside this adorable little jewelry store certainly will. Snag a trio of stackable rings or opal adorned studs that appear to be lit from within.\n\nWhen it comes to home enhancements and self-care, Public Mercantile is the place to check out locally-sourced curated goods. Or, if you need a gift for your bibliophile friend, stop by the stylishly low-tech Regional Assembly of Text to craft your own custom-made button or browse through metal filing cabinets chalk full of handmade cards, books, journals and lettered goods.\n\nBrimming with an abundance of unique shops, Victoria’s thriving and vibrant Chinatown also offers a treasure trove of trinkets. Once a noodle factory, the airy Fan Tan Home and Style has been in Victoria for more than 40 years and has become a staple for superb home décor and furniture.\n\nLook for exotic fair trade rugs and baskets from overseas, locally crafted wood furniture, colorful plates, funky socks, cozy throws and gifts made out of recycled materials, like cans and tin. Before you leave, be sure to say “hi” to the very big black cat who guards the shop. If you need to refuel after all your shopping, take a breather at the minimalistic Silk Road Tea and sip your way from everything from green to black tea at the shop’s tasting bar before selecting the perfect blend to take home with you.\n\nWhether you want to sample local wines or dine on incredible cuisine, Victoria offers an endless array of captivating activities. Spending a weekend in Victoria is the ultimate way to enjoy some relaxing downtime with your girls."
