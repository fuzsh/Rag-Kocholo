        "text": "Pour visiter ce site vous devez avoir l'âge légal pour acheter et consommer de l'alcool. S'il n'existe pas de législation à cet égard dans votre pays, vous devez être âgé de 18 ans au moins.\n\nTo view the Domaine Rémy Nodin website you must be of legal drinking age within your country of residence. If no such laws exist in your country you have to be over 18 to visit our website.\n\nOUI / YES\n\nNON / NO\n\nOUR WINES\n\nOur work in the cellar aims to obtain unique, straight wines, expressing the terroir and the vintage. Our vinification içs natural and traditional, the wines are aged from 12 to 42 months in our cellars before being marketed.\n\nLILY FLOWERS\n\nSaint-Péray LYS FLORISSANT\n\nIn Saint-Péray, where sparkling wines have marked the history of France, Rémy Nodin signs a manifesto of elegance with this “Lys Florissant”. This authentic style wine from an exclusive vineyard, whose origins date back to the 13th century, is generous in its structure, in the flavors which combine freshness, smoothness and structure.\n\nBrut nature, 0g/l de sugars\n\nUnique edition of 712 bottles\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nSmall rattes with foie gras and caviar\n\nScallops with langoustines\n\nPheasant with walnuts and dried apricots\n\nLILY FLOWERS\n\nSaint-Péray LE SUCHAT\n\nIt is the oldest vine on the estate, planted in 1936 by Ernest and Paul Nodin. This exceptional cuvée, mass selection of 80% Marsanne and 20% Roussanne, is bottled in a prestigious bottle. This place called “Le Suchat” stands on a sandy-silty hillside which is one of the historic soils of the Saint-Péray appellation. Each year, only 800 bottles are produced and give a wine with a fine complex nose, vanilla, toasted bread and a round and fresh mouth at the same time, notes of candied fruit, honey and hazelnut.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nQuail stuffed with foie gras,\n\nDuck breast with apricots,\n\nLamb tagine\n\nSINGLE-PARCEL BASED\n\nCornas LES EYGATS\n\nCornas means “scorched earth” in Celtic. The granitic soils of volcanic origin give this appellation an exceptional character. Its landscape, its hills, the harshness of its soils and its climate sometimes forge rustic men and grapes. Once aged, polished by the winemaker, the wine becomes a bright ruby. When you open a bottle of Eygas, all the excellence and potential of Syrah is expressed.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nWild boar stew with cranberries\n\nBraised pheasant with marsala and caramelized endives\n\nChocolate cake (the « Opera », the « Royal »)\n\nSINGLE-PARCEL BASED\n\nLe Saint-Joseph GUILHERAND\n\nThe Guilherand cuvée has a special charm, that of being produced on the southernmost parcels of the appellation, on limestone or even marl soil. This unique feature gives the wine a great aromatic finesse of small red fruits and sweet spices. On the palate, there is roundness, richness and some of the most elegant tannins in the estate.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nSalmon on toast, verrine of avocado with chilli\n\nBaked trout “en papillote”,\n\nFruit pie.\n\nSINGLE-PARCEL BASED\n\nCrozes-Hermitage LE MAZEL\n\n“La Blache du Mazel” in the commune of Champis is the house where Ernest Nodin, founder of the estate, was born. The Nodin family had been plowing there for more than 300 years. This cuvée is a tribute to this place and to the deep agricultural roots of the Nodin family. A ruby color, a complex bouquet of black fruits, spices, a supple and greedy mouth accompanied by the typical structure of Syrah.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nRooster in wine\n\nBavette or tab with shallot\n\nSausage Rougail.\n\nSINGLE-PARCEL BASED\n\nThe Saint Peray ERNEST EXTRA BRUT\n\nSince 1829, the great sparkling wines of Saint-Péray have been the apogee of this appellation. Fallen into oblivion after the two wars, this prestigious product almost disappeared. In 2011, Rémy Nodin wishes to perpetuate this local tradition and harvests the first grapes for the development of this traditional method.\n\nPrecursor of the Brut Nature category, the Ernest Brut Nature is a wine without added sugar, it expresses a Saint-Péray in its pure state. Rémy Nodin Ernest Brut Nature is a true illustration of the estate's know-how.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nSalmon on toast, verrine of avocado with chilli\n\nBaked trout “en papillote”,\n\nFruit pie.\n\nSINGLE-PARCEL BASED\n\nSaint-Péray COTEAU DE LA BEYLESSE\n\nThe vintage of the beginning, born in 2008, it comes from a selection of grapes, 100% Marsanne and on the hillside at a place called Beylesse. The richness of this wine comes from its clay-limestone soil, unique in the appellation. In our cellars, a selection of the best juices, vinified in barrels at low temperature and aged for 11 months on fine lees, gives it grilled notes and white fruits such as pear or apricot. It has a round mouth, smooth concentrated and supported by a well-adjusted mineral freshness.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nFoie gras with confit onion,\n\nScallops on leek mousse,\n\nGrilled prawns with Cajun spices,\n\nGuinea fowl with morel cream\n\nArdèche cheeses: Picodons, goat cheeses…\n\nTHE CLASSICS\n\nSaint-Péray\n\nAn association of 90% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne, this classic Saint-Péray is a selection of several localities, “La Beylesse”, “Grand Plantier” and “Julière”. Vinified for 1 month at low temperature and aged for 6 months in the cellar on fine lees, this cuvée offers floral and fruity notes with a supple, fresh and balanced attack.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nSmall sausage of brill with tomato coulis\n\nOysters fresh or gratinated in the oven\n\nPicodon from the Ardèche / hot roasted goat cheese\n\nTHE CLASSICS\n\nIGP Ardèche SEGOVELLAUNES\n\nThis Gallic people was located in the Rhone Valley. Their territory is confined in Drôme between the mountains of Tricastin to the south, those of Vercors to the east and the river of the Isère department to the north; in Ardèche between the Doux river to the north and the Eyrieux river to the south. The Gallic ethnonym sego means \"victory, strength\" and vellauno \"leaders, commanders\".\n\nI find myself dreaming that these people worked the land where our grapes are produced today, and I tell myself that we are a bit part of this Segovellaunes people.\n\n100% Syrah grown in the town of Saint-Péray. Deep purple in color with aromas of violets and small red fruits, a supple, silky mouthfeel with a slight tannic structure.\n\nThe sommelier's pairings\n\nAperitif, picnic and charcuterie, a great everyday bottle."
