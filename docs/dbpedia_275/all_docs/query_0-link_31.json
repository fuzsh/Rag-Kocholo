        "text": "Here at Road Scholar, we agree that the best times to visit Canada are April-June and September-November when the weather is warmer and the crowds have lessened from that of peak season.\n\nThat being said, the best time to visit Canada is certainly subjective. If you don’t mind cold weather, the wintertime offers beautiful snow-filled landscapes and excellent offerings of winter sports. In winter, visitors will be able to ski the steep Chutes of British Columbia, ice skate the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, and witness the spectacular Northern Lights.\n\nIn springtime in Canada with milder temperatures and fun festivals throughout the country. Feast your eyes on a sea of beautiful Tulips in Ottawa at the Canadian Tulip Festival. The Annapolis Apple Blossom Festival in Nova Scotia is not to be missed. And who doesn’t love to bear witness to the blooms of a cherry tree, which you can do in Vancouver at the Cherry Blossom Festival. What a spectacle of eye candy for those who appreciate nature in full bloom!\n\nIf you are ready to forge ahead with the rest of the crowds in the summer months, there are beautiful sights to behold. In July, tap into your love of cowboy culture at the Calgary Stampede in July, and then listen to some of the best jazz in the world at the Festival de Jazz de Montreal (Montreal Jazz Festival in July) in Quebec. If you appreciate the great outdoors, summer is a great time to soak in all the open space and natural wonders Canada has to offer.\n\nThe bright, colorful changing leaves of Autumn will leave you awe-inspired from September to December. From a luscious green, the foliage in Canada transforms to vivid yellows, oranges, and reds. A few of the popular events in the Autumn season are The Tremblant Symphony of Colors in Quebec, Kitchener/Waterloo Oktoberfest, the Niagara Grape & Wine Festival in St. Catherines, and the Celtics Colors International Festival in Nova Scotia.\n\nCanada was once a French colony, which was conquered by the British, and now the country has a dual colonial heritage that influences its culture today. Canadian culture is known to be multicultural and progressive, with influence from Great Britain, France, and America. This British, French, America and Canadian culture consists of indigenous people and immigrants from around the world, making the country a melting pot of arts, customs, and languages.\n\nCanadians enjoy publicly funded health care, gun control, programs to eradicate poverty, and equal rights across race and gender. Canada has two official languages, English and French, as well as 60 Aboriginal or Indigenous spoken languages\n\nA few things Canada is known for: maple syrup, ice hockey, Northern Lights, polar bears, Niagara Falls, and spectacular National Parks.\n\nBilingual Provinces\n\nThough English will be spoken at almost any public place and major city as one of the official languages of Canada, New Brunswick and Manitoba have declared themselves bilingual English and French, and Québec has actually declared themselves unilingual, with its primary language being French. Canadian French does differ slightly from European French, with additional variations for Métis French and Acadian French, due to its English influences. In addition to French and English, there are also 12 Indigenous language groups in Canada.\n\nAboriginal People\n\nFrom the prairies to the Arctic, the Aboriginal people have communities across the country, with three major groups. The largest is the First Nations, who mainly reside in British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories (making up just over a third of this territory). Explore the arctic region of Canada and you’ll find “Inuit Nunangat” – Inuit land that’s been inhabited for over 5,000 years. Similar to First Nations, harmony and interdependence with the natural world is an Inuit core value, and hunting is an important way of life. The last major group is the Métis Nation, who have mixed European and Indigenous ancestry, and consist of almost 600,000 people. Though these mixed marriages have been traced back through the centuries, the Métis people weren’t officially acknowledged until 1982 and fought for their recognition as full-rights Aboriginal people until it was granted in 2003.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nEach province has its own regional specialties but perhaps two of the most well-known Canadian foods are poutine and maple syrup. The former is Québecois invention consisting of fries topped with gravy and local cheese curds, though many restaurants have put their own spin on the classic. If you’re craving something sweeter, you’ll be pleased to know that Canada produces 71% of the world's pure maple syrup, 91% of which is produced in Québec. Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia also love this sweet sap, which was introduced by the Aboriginal people to early Canadian settlers. Seafood from the coastal provinces is also world famous, especially lobster from New Brunswick (the town of Shediac is the lobster capital of the world!), scallops from Nova Scotia and mussels from P.E.I.\n\nSome might be surprised to discover that wine in Canada is award-winning and differs across the country. Ontario and British Columbia are the biggest wine producers, followed by Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Québec. Ice wine is the most famous, as Canada is the world’s leading ice wine producer, followed by white wine, though red wine production is slowly increasing around the country. In Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, where the climate isn’t great for grape wine, fruit wineries and meaderies are becoming more and more common.\n\nThough inhabited by Aboriginal peoples for centuries, the first European explorer who touched Canadian soil was John Cabot in 1497, followed shortly after by Jacques Cartier, who claimed the east coast for France. Soon, Britain also sailed toward this new land, claiming part of the present-day Canadian Maritimes and pushing the indigenous tribes out of the region along with the other European explorers. After several battles over land ownership between the French and British, Canada was officially born in 1867 and consisted of just three provinces, though the next 30 years would bring seven new provinces and territories to this land. 1946 and 1999 would complete what is now modern-day Canada with the addition of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut, respectively.\n\nA brief timeline of Canada’s history\n\n14,000 BCE\n\nThe first known inhabitants of Canada are the Paleo-Indians, who moved across the Beringia land bridge from eastern Siberia into Yukon\n\n1534\n\nJacques Cartier claims the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence for France.\n\n1583\n\nNewfoundland becomes England’s first overseas colony.\n\n1756\n\nThe Seven Year’s War begins between the French and British Canadian colonies, and ends with Britain claiming Québec..\n\n1867\n\nThe British North America Act united Ontario, Québec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick as the Dominion of Canada.\n\n1870-1880\n\nManitoba enters the Dominion of Canada, followed by British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and the Northwest Territories.\n\n1898\n\nWith the popularity of the gold rush, Yukon is separated from the Northwest Territories.\n\n1905\n\nAlberta and Saskatchewan become provinces in Canada.\n\n1949\n\nNewfoundland becomes the next province to be a part of Canada.\n\n1982\n\nGreat Britain transfers all legal powers to Canada, granting it complete independence.\n\n1999\n\nNunavut is the last territory or province to become a part of Canada, completing what is now the modern country.\n\nDo you need a passport to travel to Canada?\n\nYes, like most countries, Canada requires international travelers to have a passport when traveling to Canada. One of the most important tips for going to Canada is to ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay, which is a precaution should an emergency arise that requires you to stay in Canada longer than expected.\n\nCan U.S. citizens travel to Canada without a passport?\n\nNo, like any international traveler, Canada requires U.S. citizens to present a valid passport when crossing its border. However, U.S. citizens can also use a valid passport card or NEXUS card to prove their identity.\n\nDo I need a visa to travel to Canada?\n\nFor U.S. citizens, a visa is not required to travel to Canada if tourism travel is less than 180 days. However, other types of travel may require a visa, and more information can be found on Canada’s Immigration and Citizenship website.\n\nWhat do I need to travel to Canada?\n\nTravelers looking to explore Canada will need a valid passport or visa that proves their citizenship and identity, depending on their country and reason for travel. However, along with the appropriate travel documents, there are other important tips for visiting Canada to keep in mind to ensure a smooth visit.\n\nOne of the top tips to travel to Canada is to pack accordingly. The weather and temperature can fluctuate drastically, especially at altitude and depending on the time of year, so make sure to pack layers that you can take off or put on to remain comfortable on your adventures. Additionally, make sure to pack any necessary medications, along with other essentials like food and water to stay hydrated and energized on U.S. and Canada travel tours.\n\nIs it safe to travel to Canada?\n\nYes, overall, Canada is a safe place to travel. The U.S. Department of State advises travelers to exercise normal precautions when exploring Canada, which is the lowest travel advisory the U.S. grants other countries due to low safety and security risks."
