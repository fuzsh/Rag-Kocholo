The best way to address inadmissibility to Canada varies depending on a number of factors, including:\n\nThe number and type of offence(s);\n\nWhen the sentencing for the offence(s) was completed; and\n\nThe severity of the offence(s).\n\nTypes and Number of Offences\n\nDrunk driving charges are prosecuted under a variety of designations around the world. Examples of charges that can result from driving while impaired include:\n\nDriving Under the Influence (DUI)\n\nDriving While Impaired (DWI)\n\nDriving While Ability Impaired (DWAI)\n\nOperating While Intoxicated (OWI)\n\nOperating a Motor Vehicle While Intoxicated (OMVI)\n\nWet Reckless\n\nBoating Under the Influence (BUI)\n\nCanada will examine your criminal record, which can include arrests, warrants, pending charges, and convictions. However, what matters most is not your crime(s) per se but rather how Canada understands it to translate into Canadian law.\n\nThey pay more attention to the equivalent crime in Canada. For example, an American citizen convicted of a misdemeanor-level drunk driving offence may still find themselves criminally inadmissible to Canada due to its equivalent in Canadian law.\n\nHaving more than one driving under the influence charge can significantly impact your ability to gain temporary access into Canada. Those who possess multiple charges or convictions can be deemed a higher risk for reoffending upon entry and be subject to higher scrutiny from a Canadian immigration officer.\n\nPossible Solutions for Canada DUI Entry\n\nThere are actually four different methods of entering Canada with a past DUI conviction.\n\nTemporary Resident Permit (Consulate): This permit allows an individual to become temporarily admissible to Canada. Individuals whose most recent offence occurred less than five years ago may be eligible for a TRP. Requests for a TRP are processed at Canadian Visa Offices.\n\nTemporary Resident Permit (Port of Entry): In certain urgent circumstances, a TRP can be issued at a Canadian port of entry, which can be any place staffed by a Canadian immigration officer or border agent.\n\nCriminal Rehabilitation: This process allows an individual to permanently resolve their inadmissibility issue. Individuals who completed sentencing more than five years ago may be eligible for Permanent Rehabilitation.\n\nDeemed Rehabilitation: If an individual received a single DUI conviction (prior to 2018), and more than 10 years have passed from the completion of his or her sentencing, he or she may be eligible to enter Canada without needing to go through the rehabilitation process.\n\nTemporary Resident Permit (TRP)\n\nUnder Five Years Since Completion of DUI Sentence\n\nIf it has been less than five years since the completion of the DUI sentence, the individual must apply for a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) in order to enter Canada legally. The TRP is a temporary waiver of inadmissibility (for up to a maximum of three years) that allows an individual who would otherwise be inadmissible to enter Canada to enter the country.\n\nIn order to be granted a TRP, the individual must have a reason for coming to Canada, and immigration authorities must not determine the individual is not a threat to Canadian society. Because this determination involves a subjective component, it is important for individuals to submit a well-prepared and compelling TRP application package.\n\nMore than Five Years but Less than Ten Years Since Completion of DUI Sentence\n\nIf it has been more than five years, but less than 10 years, since completion of a sentence, an individual may be eligible to apply for criminal rehabilitation after the five-year benchmark has been reached.\n\nIf the application is approved, he or she will have a clean slate and be eligible to enter Canada. There will no longer be any hindrances relating to the previous conviction(s), and the individual will be able to enter and leave Canada provided he or she doesn’t commit another offence, and complies with any applicable visa requirements.\n\nIn order to be considered criminally rehabilitated, it must be demonstrated that an inadmissible individual has ‘turned over a new leaf’ since the conviction(s), and is judged unlikely to reoffend. The approval of this application is dependent on the subjective assessment of immigration authorities. For this reason, applicants are well served to prepare an application that conforms to what Canadian authorities are looking for in a rehabilitated individual.\n\nTen Years or More Since Completion of DUI Sentence\n\nIf it has been 10 years or more since completion of a sentence, an inadmissible individual could be deemed rehabilitated simply as a result of the passage of time, and admitted to the country. This solution is only possible in cases where the individual has a single, non-serious conviction on his or her record.\n\nHowever, it is possible for the individual to experience difficulties even in such a scenario. This potential obstacle is because border authorities have a significant amount of discretion in the exercise of their duties and, as a result, can refuse entry to individuals even though they are no longer inadmissible as a result of deemed rehabilitation.\n\nA legal opinion letter, written by an experienced Canadian immigration attorney, can be helpful in avoiding this unpleasant situation.\n\nCan you Enter Canada 10 Years after your DUI Conviction?\n\nCanada’s driving under the influence (DUI) laws changed in December of 2018. As a result, a DUI is now considered serious criminality.\n\nUnder the previous law, any DUI conviction was removed from a visitor’s record 10 years after the completion of their sentence, allowing them to be deemed rehabilitated to enter Canada. However, at this time it is not possible.\n\nIf you have received a DUI after December 18, 2018, then you will always need to apply for clearance into Canada prior to entering the country.\n\nThe Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) and Criminal Rehabilitation applications offer potential short and long-term solutions for past DUI convictions. Consulting with a Canadian immigration lawyer about which application best suits your current needs is always recommended.\n\nGet a Free Legal Consultation"
