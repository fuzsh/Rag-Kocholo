        "text": "A whole gift guide dedicated to French gifts? At Bon Appétit? Mon Dieu! C’est…comment dit-on “a bit on the nose,” non?\n\nMaybe so, but you can’t deny that French cuisine has long had an outsized influence on food culture, and fine dining in particular, all around the world. The nation of fine wine, exquisite pastries, and going on strike has remained the number one global tourist destination for nearly three decades, drawing roughly 89 million visitors in 2023 alone.\n\nIf you’re shopping for a gourmand this holiday season, there’s a good chance that they’ll appreciate something on this list of French-centric food gifts. Below you’ll find specialized cookware and tools, luxuriously scented soaps and candles, and a trove of delectable cheeses, condiments, and other foodstuffs that will delight even the most discerning Francophiles. And just in case you were worried, I’ll assure you from the top: You won’t find any Eiffel Tower tchotchkes here.\n\nKitchen and Home\n\nA better way to store butter\n\nA French butter crock is an ingenious way to store butter without refrigeration. A shallow pool of water keeps butter from oxidizing and going rancid, ensuring spreadable fresh butter whenever you need it.\n\nA bread-proofing basket\n\nA banneton does more than give a loaf of sourdough that signature boulangerie look. The wood basket also draws moisture from the surface of the dough, which helps bakers achieve that burnished bien cuit exterior crust.\n\nA proper rolling pin\n\nWe vastly prefer French rolling pins over American-style pins; French pins are subtly tapered toward the ends, as opposed to having handles. We’ve found that this style offers greater control and maneuverability when rolling out dough in our product tests.\n\nA cheese cloche\n\nThis marble platter and glass cloche is the ideal way to serve cheese. The marble keeps things nice and cool, and the dome prevents cheese from sweating and drying out by preserving a stable humidity level.\n\nMauviel tarte Tatin pan\n\nWhen giving cookware, I go for specialized items rather than utilitarian staples. I like to give something the recipient likely doesn’t already have, or wouldn’t buy themselves, but would appreciate and use it if they did. We recommend this pan for anyone who's had a lifelong dream to execute a perfect tarte Tatin, but it also comes in handy for any other oven-baked casseroles and braises. Of course, it doesn’t get more quintessentially French than Mauviel copper cookware.\n\nA foolproof madeleine pan\n\nThis Silpat madeleine pan is ideal for making these iconic Lorranian sponge cakes. The silicone prevents the surface from browning too quickly, and it’s easy to unmold the delicate cakes without slamming the pan and risking damage.\n\nA candle that smells like the hardwood floors of Versailles\n\nCire Trudon candles are far from a typical scented candle. Their complex scents have an uncanny quality and an ability to transport you to far off places, evoking things like the mossy stone walls of a medieval nunnery, a chimney fire on a wintry day, or in this case, the waxed parquet floors of the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. This candle fills any room with a citrusy and coniferous scent—whether or not it’s lit.\n\nA serving bowl from an iconic Parisian ceramic workshop\n\nAstier de Villatte makes whimsical handmade ceramics from glazed black terra-cotta. Each piece it produces is a lovely work of sculpture for your home in addition to a serving piece, and the brand is beloved by a certain set of tastemakers. This salad bowl makes an ideal first piece to inspire a lifelong love affair.\n\nExceptional hand soap\n\nDiptyque is known first and foremost for candles, but its gel hand soaps are no less gift-worthy vehicle for their intoxicating fragrances. This particular scent is bright and invigorating, laced with notes of bitter orange blossom and juniper berry.\n\nCut crystal coupe glasses fit for a queen\n\nFounded in 1586, Saint-Louis is the oldest glassware manufacturer in France. European monarchs have sloshed Champagne from these cut crystal coupe glasses for generations, and who says you can’t too?\n\nA provincial linen tablecloth\n\nEnthusiasts of the more rustic side of French life might prefer something like a flax linen tablecloth, which will come in handy for long summer dinners to come in the new year.\n\nBooks\n\nThe quintessential culinary encyclopedia\n\nLarousse Gastronomique is a behemoth text and one of the most comprehensive reference guides for information on cooking techniques and culinary history. The modern edition has nearly 1,350 pages and encompasses information from cuisines around the world, but it maintains a predominant focus on French food culture.\n\nA classic memoir detailing life in a country chateau\n\nPeter Mayle’s 1989 best-selling memoir documented the idiosyncrasies of living in rural Provence with humor and descriptive splendor. It’s a cozy and captivating read, with lush details of local food and drink that still hold up today.\n\nA culinary history book that’s difficult to put down\n\nWriter Justin Spring has a knack for presenting history with the candor of an exceptionally erudite gossip. The Gourmand’s Way details the lives and experiences of Richard Olney, M.F.K. Fisher, Julia Child, and other prominent Americans living in post-war France who each had a hand in shaping America’s relationship with food. It’s simultaneously informative and salacious, presenting an unvarnished and up close view of the lives of a culinarily-minded milieu.\n\nColette’s culinarily-infused writings\n\nColette was not only one of the most prominent French authors of the 20th century, she was also a self-described “glutton and gourmand.” A 1979 article in The New York Times detailed how much of her work is underscored by vividly appealing culinary description. Consider this comprehensive collection of her writing for the bookish foodie in your life.\n\nA guide to French wine sparing no detail\n\nFeaturing 900 producers and over 7,000 wines spread out across two beautifully illustrated volumes, The New French Wine is an impressive compendium of knowledge that belongs in the library of every avowed oenophile.\n\nMelissa Clark’s ode to modern French cooking\n\nMelissa Clark continues the tradition of evangelizing French cuisine to an American audience. Her bestseller Dinner in French provides a thorough and contemporary vision of French cuisine, crafted by the expert hand of a veteran recipe developer.\n\nClothes and accessories\n\nA very fashionable French laboureur jacket\n\nMaybe an apron or pinafore would be more apt, but this iconic piece of workwear is as good a culinary smock as it is an exceedingly au courant piece of streetwear.\n\nA baguette bag for actual baguettes\n\nNot many Americans are lucky enough to live close to a proper bread bakery. But for the few who enjoy this luxury, a dedicated linen bag for storing and transporting a fresh baguette makes for a fabulous gift.\n\nFrench market tote\n\nThe story goes that residents of seaside Normandy began repurposing fishing nets as bags for carrying goods around town, and thus the netted French market tote was born. These bags are perfect for weekend farmers market hauls and trips to the beach.\n\nA handy French pocket knife\n\nThis iconic Opinel pocket knife is remarkably simple in design, and it alone turned me into a pocket knife person. Use it for slicing apples! Or for harvesting herbs! Or for whittling soap! I use mine to open boxes! It’s truly the best.\n\nFood and Snacks\n\nThe macaron\n\nIf you didn’t know already, Ladurée Paris invented the macaron. This confection might be a bit obvious as a French gift, but it’s obvious because it’s that good.\n\nChocolates from Maison du Chocolat\n\nSilky ganaches and delightfully textured pralines are Maison du Chocolat specialties, and any chocolate lover will appreciate these little morsels. Gift a small box or go all out with the 144-piece box.\n\nThe original flaky salt\n\nFleur de sel is a fine, flaky variety of salt harvested from coastal salt marshes. France is one of the oldest producers of fleur de sel, which is prized for its bright oceanic flavor profile.\n\nExceptionally royal cognac mustard\n\nMoutarde de Meaux Pommery mustard has historical pedigree, relying on a centuries-old recipe passed down for generations. It’s a whole grain mustard that’s more mild than nose-clearing Dijon. The standard variety is enough of a gift itself, but why not go for the special edition, which is infused with French cognac?\n\nA gift box full of French cheeses\n\nA French gift guide would not be complete without cheese, and Murray’s is a trustworthy cheesemonger that’s available nationwide. In this box, you’ll find aged Comté, Roquefort, Bucheron, and Morbier, as well as additional accoutrements for a proper plateau de fromage.\n\nTea from a fancy-schmancy tea atelier\n\nThe brand Mariage Frères has been selling gourmet teas for over a century. They’re known for their intensely aromatic blends made from high-quality full leaf tea. Earl Grey is always a crowd-pleaser, and this blend is mixed with blue cornflower, which gives it a nuanced floral note."
