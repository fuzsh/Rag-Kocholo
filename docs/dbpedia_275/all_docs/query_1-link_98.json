        "text": "If you spend some time in France or do a lot of reading or listening in French, you’ll notice that the French don’t always answer “oui” when you ask them a question.\n\nInstead, they might use the equivalent of “of course”, “yup” or “maybe”, or expressions like “Of course”, “I agree,” and “That’s it precisely.” There’s even a way to say “yes” in French when you’re confirming a negative statement.\n\nLet’s take a look at an impressive 28 different ways to say “yes” in French!\n\nThe typical yes\n\nA simple “Oui” is the most standard, basic, and neutral affirmative reply in French.\n\nOui has a long and fascinating history, and is the winner of a long-running linguistic battle. By the Middle Ages, French had evolved into numerous dialects that were essentially mutually unintelligible. But you could group them into three major categories: the langues d’oïl, the langues d’oc, and other dialects. Oïl and oc refer to how speakers of these dialects said the word “yes”.\n\nOver time, since it was spoken in Paris, the royal city, the langue d’oïl became the dominant dialect. Oui is the modern French evolution of the word oïl.\n\nOui is also a good word to know for romantics. In a traditional French wedding ceremony, the bride and groom answer Oui, je le veux (Yes, I want this (marriage, life together, etc.)).\n\nYou can use oui in just about any situation where an affirmative response is required. It’s a neutral expression, so there’s no sense of it being particularly formal or informal. If you want to make it sound especially polite or respectful, you can add something to it.\n\nFor example:\n\nOui, madame/monsieur. (Yes, ma’am/sir.)\n\nOui, s’il vous plait. (Yes, please.)\n\nThe contradiction yes\n\n“Si” is what I like to call the contradiction yes.\n\nThe French use si to contradict negative questions and statements in both formal and informal situations.\n\nFor example:\n\nTu n’as jamais visité Nantes, n’est-ce pas ?\n\nSi, l’année dernière.\n\nYou’ve never been to Nantes, right?\n\nYes, I have, last year.\n\nWhile si is used in France and by French-speakers in other European countries, many sources, including this one, point out that si isn’t used as an affirmation of a negative statement in Canada or in African Francophone countries. Canadians just say oui, while many African Francophone speakers would answer a question like this with non.\n\nSo, for a Canadian, the answer to the question in the example dialogue above would be Oui, l’année dernière.\n\nFor African Francophone speakers, the answer would be Non, l’année dernière – or maybe to clarify (as an English-speaker would do if they answered “no” to affirm a question), Non, j’ai visité Nantes l’année dernière.\n\nThe neutral yes\n\n“D’accord”is the French equivalent of “alright”.\n\nIf you break it down, this makes sense, since the word “accord” in both English and French implies agreement.\n\nD’accord can be formal or informal, making it a great alternative to oui.\n\nIn addition to a stand-alone response, it’s also used in the expression “être d’accord” (to agree).\n\nFor example :\n\nOn se voit demain ?\n\nD’accord !\n\nShall we get together tomorrow?\n\nAlright!\n\nJe suis d’accord avec toi, les chatons sont plus mignons que les chiots.\n\nI agree with you, kittens are cuter than puppies.\n\nThe casual yes\n\n“Ça marche”is a casual way to say “It’s/That’s ok for me” in French. It literally translates to “That works”.\n\nIt’s an informal expression, so you can basically use it with anyone you are on a “tu” basis with.\n\nYou could also use the less common “Ça roule” (literally: “It/That rolls”) instead. This expression is the rough equivalent of “That’s cool.”\n\nSometimes people add “ma poule” (literally: “my chicken”) to the end: Ça roule, ma poule. This is a bit outdated and funny – think of it like “okey dokey” in English – so if you want a serious reaction, don’t add ma poule.\n\nExamples:\n\nJe passe te chercher à 14 heures lundi.\n\nÇa marche.\n\nI’ll pick you up at 2PM on Monday.\n\nOk/Alright/That works for me.\n\nJe passe te chercher à 14 heures lundi.\n\nÇa roule.\n\nI’ll pick you up at 2PM on Monday.\n\nCool.\n\nThe obvious answer “yes”\n\nIf a person asks you something to which the answer seems obvious, you could answer:\n\nBien sûr(Of course)\n\nEvidemment(Obviously/Clearly)\n\nYou can use bien sûr in any situation, but évidemment is better suited to formal situations.\n\nTu aimes le chocolat ?\n\nBien sûr/Évidemment.\n\nThe unconvinced yes\n\nYour friend absolutely wants to introduce you to someone, but you’d rather stay at home. The conversation could go something like this:\n\nÇa va être génial, tu verras.\n\nIt’s gonna be great, you’ll see.\n\nMouais…\n\nMm yeah/Yeah, okay, whatever…\n\nAs you might have guessed, mouais is a portmanteau of hum (um) and ouais (yeah).\n\nIn some cases, it implies being bored or unimpressed, as well as unconvinced. You can see this usage in this review of a restaurant, entitled “mouais bof” — the equivalent of “Meh” (not great or exciting) in English.\n\nNote that mouais is extremely informal and could come off as rude if you use it in professional occasions or with a stranger. It should only be used with friends or people you can be casual around. Even then, if the person is talking about something they’re serious or passionate about, responding “Mouais” would probably come off as mean.\n\nThe “Where do I sign?” yes\n\nSometimes an opportunity comes up that’s so exciting that you wish you could say “yes” even before the person is done talking. That’s when you can use “carrément”in French. It’s the equivalent of “Absolutely!” in English.\n\nBut you should only use it in informal situations.\n\nExample:\n\nÇa te dirait de visiter Costa Rica cet été ?\n\nCarrément.\n\nWant to go to Costa Rica this summer?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNote that in addition to its affirmative use, carrément is an adverb that means “totally/straight/straight up/dead”. You can see the different ways it’s used in this context, here.\n\nThe “I agree” yes\n\nIf you’re happy to do something, but can’t use the casual carrément because you’re in a formal or professional setting, you can opt for one of these variations instead:\n\nVolontiers (Gladly/Willingly. Note the connection of this word with la volonté (will))\n\nAvec plaisir (With pleasure)\n\nCertainement (Certainly)\n\nExample:\n\nJe vous sers un café ?\n\nVolontiers.\n\nWould you like some coffee?\n\nGladly.\n\nThe irritated yes\n\nHere are two useful expressions you can use if someone asks you an irritating question:\n\nMais oui (Yes, of course)\n\nBen oui (sometimes written as Bah oui) (Uh, yeah)\n\nWhile mais oui translates directly to “but yes” – in other words, “Yes, of course”, ben or bah are phonetic representations of the sound French people make when they say the equivalent of “um” or “uh”.\n\nAlthough it usually shows irritation or annoyance, you may hear Mais oui used in sort of playful way, for example, in a commercial if someone can’t believe a deal they’re getting: Un iPhone X pour seulement 700 euros? – Mais oui!\n\nBen oui/Bah oui, on the other hand, denotes a certain sloppiness, disrespect, or extreme casualness, so even if you’re not intending to say it in an irritated way, never use this expression in formal or professional situations.\n\nAlways keep in mind that these two ways to say yes in French could easily be considered rude!\n\nHere’s an example with each expression:\n\nTu as fait tes devoirs ?\n\nMais oui, je te l’ai déjà dit trois fois !\n\nYou did your homework, right?\n\nYes, I already told you (I did) three times!\n\nor\n\nTu as fait tes devoirs ?\n\nBen oui, je te l’ai déjà dit trois fois !\n\nYou did your homework, right?\n\nDuh. I told you I did it three times already!\n\nThe genetically modified yes\n\nOuais is the “yeah” to oui’s “yes”.In other words, ouais means exactly the same thing as oui, but it’s much more informal.\n\nOuais\n\nIt’s so informal, in fact, that some people may be irritated if you use it with them.\n\nSimilar to ouais is ouaip – the equivalent of the English “yep.”\n\nOuaip\n\nLike ouais, ouaip is very informal and could be considered rude if you’re talking to someone in a professional or formal setting.\n\nOuais and ouaip are two awesome additions to your oui toolbox, but remember that to only use them with people you’re close to, that is with people you use tu with.\n\nEven then, some of those people might not like these words. My five-year-old son, for example, often says ouais with his great-aunts and -uncles, and many of them correct him and make him say oui instead.\n\nHere’s an example of a dialogue with ouais :\n\nTu es fatigué ?\n\nOuais, je me suis couché tard hier.\n\nAre you tired?\n\nYeah, I went to bed late last night.\n\nGood to know: If you’re excited about something, you can shout “Ouais !”, since this is the equivalent of “Yesss!” in English. Like “Yesss!”, remember that Ouais! is still informal.\n\nIn Canadian French, the phonetic spelling of the informal way everyday people say “Yeah” is usually written as ouain or ouin (note that this latter is also the sound of a baby crying in French, which might be confusing in some contexts…).\n\nThe “That’s right” yes\n\nWhen you want to confirm that what someone says is correct, you can use one of these (rather formal) words:\n\nExactement (Exactly)\n\nTout à fait (That’s right/Precisely)\n\nEn effet (Indeed)\n\nExample:\n\nVous êtes bien Monsieur Durand ?\n\nTout à fait.\n\nYou are Monsieur Durand, right?\n\nThat’s right.\n\nThe intellectual yes\n\nIf you’re reading an academic paper, article, or literary text in French, you might come across this little word: certes. Depending on the exact phrasing, certes can translate to “certainly,” “admittedly,” “of course,” and “To be sure”.\n\nAlthough it’s not commonly used in everyday spoken French, it pops up in formal speeches, intellectual debates, and academic lectures. And you’ll also see it in formal or academic writing. So, you could say that certes is a common way to affirm a fact or idea when it comes to brainy subjects (and speakers).\n\nFor example:\n\nCertes, Louis XVI n’était pas cruel, mais ce n’était pas un bon roi.\n\nAdmittedly, Louis XVI wasn’t cruel, but he wasn’t a good king.\n\nThe “perfect” yes\n\nSometimes, you may want to say that something is perfect. In this case, you can use:\n\nParfait (Perfect)\n\nTrès bien (Excellent)\n\nOui merci (Yes, thank you)\n\nAll of these expressions can be used in either formal or informal situations, so when you feel inspired to reply with one of them, you can do so without fear! In extremely formal situations, though, I would suggest adding merci to the end of Parfait.\n\nExample:\n\nVotre chambre vous convient-elle ?\n\nOui merci/ oui c’est parfait / oui c’est très bien.\n\nIs your room all right?\n\nYes, thank you/Yes, it’s perfect/Yes, it’s excellent.\n\nThe happy yes\n\nA common way to say “yes” in French is simply to say avec plaisir (literally: with pleasure.) Think of avec plaisir as the equivalent of “gladly.”\n\nUne piza ce soir, ça te tente? (What about a pizza tonight?)\n\nAvec plaisir ! (gladly!)\n\nIf you want to sound more formal, you can also say volontiers or even avec joie (literally: with joy). Keep in mind that the latter can easily sound mocking if said in the wrong context so make sure you only use it when you are genuinely delighted with an offer and want to enthusiastically say “yes”.\n\nDo the French always say “yes”?\n\nWe’ve just seen that there are at least 28 ways to say “yes” in French. I say “at least” because individual regions and groups may have others, and there’s new slang coming out all the time that might include some additional forms of affirmative replies. When you think of it that way, the choices for how to say “yes” in French are practically infinite!\n\nInterestingly, though, on the whole, the French aren’t exactly the most affirmative, willing people. In fact, a big part of French culture is contestation, refusal, and intellectual debate. The French refusal to just say oui to everything is very apparent when you live in France: there are frequently strikes in just about every professional sector imaginable!\n\nAccording to this fascinating article, saying “no” is ingrained in French people from childhood, and is at the root of why si exists in French spoken in France, but not in certain other more “yes”-oriented Francophone cultures.\n\nNow that you know a myriad of fun and exciting ways to say “yes” in French, pick your favorite from this list and try to use it with your conversation partner! You’ll immediately sound more French."
