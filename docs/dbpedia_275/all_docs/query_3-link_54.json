        "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met back in 2016, and their life has been a whirlwind ever since. From their secret courtship to their fairytale wedding, a growing family, and a move across the pond, here is the history of their royal relationship.\n\nHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle they met\n\nHarry's first glimpse of Meghan wasn't exactly conventional. In the Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan, the prince revealed that he first saw Meghan on a mutual friend's social media when she shared a photo of herself using the Snapchat dog filter. The unnamed friend (E! News has claimed Harry's friend Violet von Westenholz is the one who introduced them, but others have speculated it was fashion designer Mischa Nonoo) ultimately set them up on a blind date in July 2016, while Meghan was in London for Wimbledon.\n\nDespite Prince Harry's global fame, Markle says she didn't have a lot of preconceived notions about who he was before they met. \"Because I’m from the States, you don’t grow up with the same understanding of the royal family,\" she explained during the BBC interview. \"I didn’t know much about him, so the only thing that I had asked [our mutual friend] when she said that she wanted to set us up, was, 'Well is he nice?' Cause if he wasn't kind, it just didn’t seem like it would make sense.\"\n\nMeghan also revealed that she scoped out Harry' s secret Instagram account before agreeing to the date. \"That to me was the best barometer,\" she said on Harry & Meghan. \"So I went through and it was just beautiful photography and all these environmental shots, and this time he was spending in Africa.\"\n\nThe date got off to a slightly rocky start. \"We met at 76 Dean Street. You were late!\" Meghan exclaimed in the docuseries when the couple spoke about their first date, revealing that Harry kept her waiting for around half and hour after getting stuck in traffic.\n\nStill, the chemistry was immediate. \"He was just so fun, just so refreshingly fun. And that was the thing. We were like childlike together,\" she said on the show.\n\nAt the photo call in the Kensington Palace gardens following their engagement announcement, Harry was asked when he knew Markle was the one. He quickly replied, \"the very first time we met.\"\n\nThings moved quickly from there. The couple went on a second date (this time Meghan was late) and Prince Harry then invited Markle to accompany him on a trip to Africa just three or four weeks later. \"I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,\" he said, describing the whirlwind romance. \"Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to get to know each other.\"\n\n\"It just felt so right, and it felt so normal,\" Harry added in Harry & Meghan. \"That was when it just hit me, like, 'Okay, this girl, this woman is amazing, is everything I've been looking for, and she's so comfortable and so relaxed in my company.'\"\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle during the televised interview following the announcement of their engagement.\n\nThe news gets out.\n\nAfter four months of quiet dating, the news finally leaked on October 31, 2016 that Prince Harry was dating an American actress. A source told the Sunday Express that Harry is “happier than he’s been for many years” and is \"besotted\" with the Markle. According to Palace Papers author Tina Brown, \"a servant tip from the House of York\" led to tabloids discovering Harry and Meghan's relationship.\n\nOn the same day, Markle posted a sweet photo on her Instagram of two bananas spooning, possibly hinting at the new love in her life.\n\nOf this period, Markle later said: \"We had a good five, six months almost with just privacy, which was amazing.\"\n\nMeghan meets the family.\n\nIn November 2016, the Vancouver Sun published an interview with Markle promoting her collection for retailer Reitmans. In the interview, she discussed her collaboration with Reitmans, her charity work with World Vision, and her plans for the holidays. Though she avoided any mention of Harry, she happily said, “So, my cup runneth over and I’m the luckiest girl in the world!”\n\nAround the same time, People reported that Harry had already introduced the actress to his father, Prince Charles. But in Harry & Meghan Harry reveals that his \"grandmother was the first senior member of the family that Meghan met.\"\n\n\"She had no idea what it all consisted of,\" he continued. \"So it was a bit of a shock to the system for her.\"\n\n\"It's surreal. It wasn't like some big moment of like, 'Now you're going to meet my grandmother,\" Meghan shared in the docuseries. \"I didn't know I was going to meet her until moments before. We were in the car, and we were going to Royal Lodge for lunch. And he's like, 'Oh my grandmother's here, she's gonna be there after church.'\"\n\n\"And I remember we were in the car and we were driving up and he's like 'You know how to curtsy right?' And I just thought it was a joke,\" Meghan said.\n\n\"How do you explain that to people? How do you explain that you bow to your grandmother and that you would need to curtsy? Especially to an American. That's weird,\" Harry said.\n\nHarry makes a statement in defense of Meghan.\n\nHarry confirmed his relationship with Markle in a formal statement November 8, 2016. In the statement, Harry also pleads the press and trolls on social media to stop the “wave of abuse and harassment\" that had been directed at his girlfriend.\n\nAccording to Harry, he has been involved with “nightly legal battles” to stop the media from publishing defamatory stories about Markle and their relationship.\n\nPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his.\n\nDuring the BBC interview, Harry revealed that both he and Markle were taken aback by the media scrutiny. \"I think both of us were totally surprised by the reaction.\"\" In , his memoir, Harry also writes about his decision to release the statement.\n\nMany assumed that Markle would be prepared for the onslaught of attention because she had been in the public eye as an actress, but little could have prepared her for what was to come. \"There was a misconception that because I have worked in the entertainment industry that this would be something I would be familiar with,\" she said. \"But I've never been part of tabloid culture. I've never been in pop culture to that degree and and lived a relatively quiet life.\"\n\nPrince Harry with school children in Antigua in November, 2016.\n\nHer answer, she told the BBC, was to tune out the noise. \"I think we were just hit so hard at the beginning with a lot of mistruths that I made the choice to not read anything, positive or negative. It just didn't make sense and instead we focused all of our energies just on nurturing our relationship.\"\n\nOn November 18, she shared a Mahatma Gandhi quote on her Instagram, which many people interpreted as a response to Harry's statement on their relationship.\n\nEven Prince William is forced to weigh in.\n\nOn November 27, 2016, Prince William released a statement to clear up rumors that he was unhappy with his brother's decision to open up about his relationship. A portion of the statement reads, “The Duke of Cambridge absolutely understands the situation concerning privacy and supports the need for Prince Harry to support those closest to him.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan continue to grow closer\n\nIn early December 2016, Markle is photographed in Toronto wearing a gold necklace featuring the letters “M” and “H.” Later that month, she and Harry are spotted together picking out a 6-foot Christmas tree, and in London's West End holding hands on their way to see the Tony award-winning show The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. According to The Sun, the couple walk through the Soho area while admiring the Christmas lights throughout Piccadilly Circus.\n\nThe Queen approves\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the Queen is “fully supportive” and another source revealed that the Queen is “delighted to see Harry in a loving relationship.”\n\nMarkle spoke of meeting the Queen during their BBC interview. \"It's incredible to be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother. She's an incredible woman.\"\n\nAfter spending Christmas with their own families, the couple spends New Year's together in London.\n\nMeghan's family makes the news.\n\nMeghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr. discloses to the Daily Mail that their father has been aware of Meghan's relationship since it began. In the interview, Thomas says his father is, “pretty happy about Harry and he’s extremely proud of her.\"\n\nAt their engagement announcement, Markle revealed that her father has spoken with Harry several times, but he \"hasn't been able to meet him just yet.\" As Thomas Markle did not attend the royal wedding, and his relationship with his daughter is somewhat fraught, it's unclear in early 2022 if he has ever met his royal son in law.\n\nA romantic trip to Norway.\n\nAfter spending New Year's in London, the couple embarks on a romantic trip to Norway. This is the first time that the often incognito couple vacation together and according to Us Weekly, Harry planned the romantic getaway so that the two could to catch the Northern Lights. The couple stay with Harry's close friend, Inge Solheim, at his luxury property in Tromsø, Norway. A source tells the sun The Sun that Harry \"put a lot of thought into it and wanted to make it as romantic and special as possible.”\n\nMeghan meets Kate and Charlotte.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, in early 2017 Harry introduced his girlfriend to his sister-in-law Kate Middleton and Princess Charlotte at apartment 1A at Kensington Palace. According to the magazine, Kate and Markle, \"got on fabulously.\"\n\n\"She's been wonderful,\" Markle said of Kate. \"Amazing,\" continued Harry. \"As has William as well, you know, fantastic support.\"\n\nIn the docuseries, Meghan recounted the first time she met Kate, but didn't share a date. \"It's so funny if I look back at it now, because now I know so much, and I'm so glad I didn't then,\" Meghan said, \"because I could just authentically be myself without so much preparedness.\"\n\nShe recounts, \"Even when Will and Kate came over, and I had met her for the first time... They came for dinner, I remember I was in ripped jeans and I was barefoot. I was a hugger, always been a hugger. I didn't realize that that is really jarring for a lot of Brits.\"\n\nMaintaining a long-distance relationship.\n\nThough Markle filmed her USA Network series Suits in Toronto, Canada, she and Harry are spotted in early February holding hands while leaving West London's Soho House. According to The Sun, on-lookers at the member's only club say that the couple tried to remain low key by sitting in a cozy corner of the restaurant. A friend close to the couple also reportedly tells The Sun that a spring engagement is imminent: “I know that sounds a bit crazily soon, but he’s head over heels and they can’t bear to be apart.”\n\nAfter a two-month break from social media, Markle shared an Instagram post on February 12 that said, \"#NoBadEnergy.\"\n\nIn March, the couple traveled together to Montego Bay, Jamaica to attend the wedding of Harry's childhood friend Tom “Skippy” Inskip. Markle is Harry's plus one to the wedding as the prince serves as one of the ceremony's 14 ushers. A source later revealed to People, that the two were incredibly \"joyful\" during the wedding festivities, and seemed very much in love.\n\nIn April, Harry flew from England to spend Easter weekend with Markle in Toronto. Photos are released by E! Online and reveal the young prince wearing a baseball cap and toting a large duffle bag while entering Markle’s building.\n\nMeghan's life begins to change.\n\nIn April, Markle announced that she would shut down her lifestyle website, The Tig, which she had founded three years earlier. In a statement shared on both the Tig website and her Instagram, Markle said:\n\nWhat began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity. You’ve made my days brighter and filled this experience with so much joy. Keep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being the change you wish to see in the world.\"\n\nThough it is rumored that Markle shut down her passion project as a sacrifice to her royal relationship, a source told People that the real reason was her busy schedule, balancing charity work with shooting Suits.\n\nThe couple steps out.\n\nMarkle and Harry made their first public appearance as a couple (and shared a kiss) at the annual Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot, England. As Harry participated in the games, Markle, wearing a chic navy dress and white blazer, cheered on her prince from the sidelines. The couple was later snapped engaging in some PDA off-site in the polo parking lot.\n\nMarkle was back in London in May for Pippa Middleton's wedding, arriving days ahead of the festivities. According to E! Online, the actress landed at London's Heathrow Airport and was immediately escorted to Kensington Palace. While Markle did not attend the ceremony, she did reportedly go to the reception.\n\nA big birthday trip\n\nThe couple traveled to Africa in August 2017—a year after their first trip to the continent—for a romantic getaway in celebration of Markle's 36th birthday. Over the course of their three-week vacation, they visited Botswana and finished their travels at the stunning Victoria Falls.\n\nMeghan opens up\n\nMarkle spoke openly about her relationship for the first time in the October 2017 issue of Vanity Fair. \"We’re a couple. We’re in love. I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time,\" she says in the cover story. \"This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\"\n\nThat month, Markle also accompanied Prince Harry to an official royal appearance for the first time at the Invictus Games opening ceremony. Over the course of the games, cameras catch the pair holding hands at the the Wheelchair Tennis semi-final and spending time with Markle's mother, Doria Ragland. The couple even share a sweet smooch at the closing ceremony.\n\nAt this point, Harry has met Markle's mother several times. \"Her mum's amazing,\" Harry said during the BBC interview.\n\nEngaged!\n\nAfter months of speculation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle finally announced their engagement on November 27, 2017.
