        "text": "What a good perfume, and I say it again, PERFUME. The performance here is that of a perfume, not a cologne. It's nothing innovative but it's beautiful, it's directly in line with Chloé EDT, Jardin des Roses, Chloé's own Roses and others of the same vibe, but this one manages to be even fresher on the nose, it has something that reminds me of lemongrass. There's a lot of rose in the body, but I didn't find it at all vintage, there's no apparent fruit, which I loved. And the finish is very musky and, dare I say it, kind of soapy. Absolutely every time I've worn it I've been complimented, not that it makes any difference to me, but I've noticed that it's very easy to like.\n\nToday I understood everything!\n\nThe indelicacy that you find here is in the acidic/citrusy, almost sharp exit, and in the body, I evidently feel roses with stems and even their thorns crushed. It has a green/astringent touch that I've never felt in any other perfume.\n\nAt the same time, this perfume evokes all the femininity that inhabits me, and also makes me feel like a woman through and through: with my impoliteness, intensity and sometimes aggression.\n\nIt's a perfume that awakens all my essence!\n\n@portocolombo\n\nA fresh scent, with a very citrusy and burning start. After the first 30 minutes, the rose takes center stage\n\nAlthough there is a hint of bittersweet and a light musk, for me it conveys freshness from start to finish. It has zero sugar and doesn't remind me of Chloé roses, but it's a very good perfume, unlike any other I've had. Since rose is one of my favorite flowers, I have some here from Chloé, Dior, Granado... It was worth bringing this novelty to the collection.\n\nSophisticated! What a wonderful, elegant perfume! A few years ago, I had a strong dislike for rose perfume because it smelled like someone who was older and dated. Today my view has changed a lot... I think it's amazing how roses give a scent of elegance and cleanliness to fragrances! I don't think it suits everyone, apart from putting it on after a shower with very clean skin, you need to have a certain elegance to hold on to this scent. Its citrus side makes it more youthful, but it disappears very quickly. I really like the drydown when the musk appears, making the scent more and more delicious... it reminded me A LOT of Chloè. a scent of richness, sophistication, lightness and cleanliness... zero sugar!\n\nThe first of the brand that I thought really raised the bar, not in terms of innovation, but in terms of the quality of the ingredients. They went for simple, good quality and got it right\n\nA very well-made rose perfume, with just the right amount of citrus that doesn't burn the nose but opens up the scent. Opulent floral body, fresh, daytime and elegant.\n\nIt conveys a lot of naturalness, so you'd expect a natural perfume performance. Worth every penny, I've already bought a bottle and a reserve.\n\nIt's been a long time since I've seen such a beautiful rose in a perfume vase. I congratulate the perfumer on the jewel in the form of a fragrance, luminous, delicate, feminine, of impressive elegance, a sublime perfume, along the lines of Dior's Forever and Ever, but much rounder, without any edges, it projects and stays for hours, I dare say it surpasses Dior's and even Marly's Delina de Parfum. Unique, it leaves an aura of impressive refinement, perfect for our tropical climate, a masterpiece. I'm delighted with it, obviously I'll make backups....Oui never take this marvel out of the brand's catalog, you've hit the nail on the head. Elegant women with good taste will fall in love, I'm sure.\n\nAre roses for everyone?\n\nOr is not everyone for Roses?\n\nEach person's experience.\n\nSome find roses a dated scent.\n\nOthers think it smells like soap... and so on...\n\nI understand those who can't, because there was a time when I couldn't either.\n\nJardin de Grasse Rose has a citrus rose scent!\n\nIt won me over at the first spray!\n\nThere's a clear scent of the flower, citrus fruits and a green smell.\n\nAs it evolves, the citrus is mostly gone.\n\nWhat remains is Roses, Roses and more Roses.\n\nAs André said: a perfume in keeping with its purpose.\n\nBut with an extra touch due to other notes.\n\nIt's not sweet at all. But I do feel a slight sweetness, perhaps from the Jasmine.\n\n(but very slight indeed)\n\nCitrus, musky and jasmine roses (I don't even know if that word exists lol)\n\nAt the same time, it's still a classic rose perfume.\n\nFor some, perhaps more of the same. But not for me.\n\nEven though the protagonist is her all the time.\n\nI didn't find it old, or dated, or vintage, or soap-opera, or too sharp a rose.\n\nI thought it was classic! Wonderful and well-constructed!\n\nAnd aahhhh, I was just about to forget: wonderful performance!\n\nYou know something I love: mixing roses and vanilla.\n\nTry it with Patchouli too.\n\nMaybe you'll smell like grandma? Maybe!\n\nBecause Roses have this facet; and (wonderful) olfactory memory too.\n\nIf you're in love with this note, you'll love it!\n\nAt last this perfume has been reviewed here kkk I was anxious, I ordered a 5 ml decanter to try it out, at first I loved it, the presence of the Moroccan rose is stunning, it explodes on the way out with the bergamot, after about 4 hours it gave me a headache, and I started to get sick of the smell, so I decided to put the traditional grasse garden on top to soften the smell, and then I discovered something incredible, that the new garden de grasse rose made the traditional garden de grasse stick to my skin because of the rose that is the base for any perfume that has it in natural essence, and I loved the mixture, since then I've been using the 2 together and I'm being widely praised, so it's going to become a bottle for sure, being the loving, romantic and passionate pair of the conventional garden de grasse. I never imagined that a wedding like this would be so beautiful, strong and delicate at the same time, I'm in love, and this rose isn't one of my favorites, I've always liked damascena more.\n\nA perfume in keeping with its purpose, Rose! Most perfumes that feature rose have a relatively \"dated\" fragrance. Is that a bad thing? No, for those who like pink floral perfumes without the trendy gourmand. So, the perfume isn't bad, it's the proposal that people have mistakenly bought into. A brand can't work only with what's in vogue, then it will sound the same and people will criticize it in the same way. It's a good, delicate perfume, with a good intimate fixation (that's what it's all about), with the characteristic scent of roses without sugar. It's not sweet, it's not trendy, it's not gourmand (thank God). When I saw the advertisement full of roses, I already imagined something along the lines of: good, we already have enough Good Girl!"
