        "text": "Villa OUI St Barts. Say yes to Villa Oui in the Petit Cul De Sac area of St. Barts and you are saying yes to a colorful, spacious, charming, and utterly unforgettable spot for your Caribbean escape. Set in the private Domaine du Levant community, you'll enjoy privacy and quiet that is unavailable in many other parts of the island. You'll also enjoy the views from your hilltop location, and are guaranteed sea breezes that cool, calm and even inspire.\n\nThe property's location is a dream, but the entire villa is also a remarkable find. Designed as a series of interconnected bungalows, it has four bedrooms, and a long list of world-class amenities. The decor is inspired by classic French Provencal themes and everywhere you turn, you enjoy saturated hues taken straight from the tropical surroundings. Natural wood, grass rugs, and cool tiles also add to the appeal.\n\nThe central great room is where you will gather for meals, relaxing evenings in the living room, or time on the patio. The gourmet kitchen is open to the terrace and the great room, and with a breakfast bar and separate dining table indoors, you can make even morning coffee an event. The cozy living room is adjacent to the kitchen, and it too opens directly to the enormous covered terrace. An al fresco dining spot is here, along with a barbecue and many different lounge areas.\n\nThis is also where the elegant swimming pool is located, and from which you can enjoy all-day dips or sunset swims. Each of the bedrooms opens to the terrace, and these are designed with optimal privacy in mind. Featuring charming decor, they have luxurious en suite baths, high-end toiletries, and air conditioning.\n\nAre you ready to say yes to Villa Oui? Just one visit here will have you dreaming of when you can next return to enjoy its views, setting, gorgeous design and endless comforts."
