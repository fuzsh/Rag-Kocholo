Six seasons have aired bringing the series to an completion.\n\nProduction\n\nIn November 2014, it was announced that Netflix was to adapt the 2013 stage play The Audience into a television series. Peter Morgan, who wrote the 2006 film The Queen and the play, is the main scriptwriter for The Crown. The directors of the television series who were also involved in the stage production are Stephen Daldry, Philip Martin, Julian Jarrold, and Benjamin Caron. The first ten-part season was the most expensive drama produced by Netflix and Left Bank Pictures to date, costing at least £100 million. A second season was commissioned, with the series intended to span sixty episodes over six seasons. By October 2017, \"early production\" had begun on an anticipated third and fourth season, and by the following January, Netflix confirmed the series had been renewed for a third and fourth season.\n\nIn January 2020, Morgan announced that the series had been renewed for a fifth and final season. Speaking to ending the series with five seasons, after it had been intended to last six, Morgan said while crafting the stories for season five, \"it has become clear to me that this is the perfect time and place to stop\"; Netflix and Sony supported Morgan's decision. However, in July 2020, Netflix announced that the series would receive a sixth season as originally intended. Morgan said that when the storylines were being discussed for season five, \"it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons\". He added that the final two seasons would still cover up to the early 21st century, enabling them \"to cover the same period in greater detail\".\n\nTrivia\n\nHead of Netflix confirms that there are six seasons planned for The Crown.[1]\n\nMorgan originally envisioned three seasons chronicling the young, the middle-aged and the elder Queen Elizabeth.[2]\n\nThis is Netflix's most expensive drama to date, and the first series to be made in the UK.\n\nGallery\n\nPromotional Posters\n\nTrailers\n\nExternal link\n\nThe Crown on Netflix"
