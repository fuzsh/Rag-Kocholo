        "text": "The origin of Hua Hin as told by generations began in 1834, when Thailand was known as Siam and before the name Hua Hin was on the map, some agricultural areas of Petchaburi province were hit by severe drought. A group of civilians moved southward and found a seaside patch with beautiful white sand and rows of rocks along the beach. The land was furtile and fishery supply was plentiful. They settled a village here in this area called Samoe Riang (Thai สมอเรียง – rows of rocks). Later, the area became more commonly known as Laem Hin (Thai แหลมหิน – stony cape).\n\nThe hidded treasure became known by visitors in the course of railway exploration in 1909 during the reign of King Rama V. A british engineer Henry Gittins, Chief of Southern Railway Division at that time, explored the Laem Hin area on which a station was to be built and found a white pristine beach stretch in a warm soothing climate. The tale of an uncharted southern beach paradise became known by Prince Purachatra, Commander of the Royal State Railways at that time, and later among the royal and noble households. By the time the rail route to Hua Hin Station began operations in 1911, the area was already becoming popular and attracted visitors.\n\nPrince Nares (Krom Pra Naresworarit) built the first royal residence in Hua Hin on the southern side of Laem Hin village which was named ‘Sansamran-Sukaves’. He was the person who gave the name ‘Hua Hin’ to differentiate the resort area from Laem Hin village. Before long, the name Hua Hin eventually extended to cover the entire beach resort district.\n\nBeing known for the warm, soothing climate along with its serene beach, Hua Hin gradually became a vacation destination for the kings, the royal households and noble families. At that time the Sansamran-Sukaves royal residence and small wooden houses built within its vicinity (known as Sukaves bungalows) received many notable royal guests. In 1917 with the gaining popularity, the Royal Railway Dept. purchased a fine estate on the stony cape area and buit multiple wooden houses to supply Hua Hin visitors.\n\nIn 1922 the luxury Railway Hotel (Hotel Hua Hin) and the remarkable Royal Hua Hin Golf Course were founded by the Royal State Railways under the royal endorsement of HM. King Rama VI, who saw Hua Hin’s potential and wished to develop the resort to become a major tourism destination of the peninsula. At that time, the completion of rail routes connecting Bangkok and Malacca in 1921 would also mean rail passengers are likely to fancy a decent overnight rest in between their long-hour rail journey. Hotel Hua Hin was designed by an Italian architect and, in the beginning, its first main building was completed with 2-storey and 14 guest rooms. It offered luxury western-styled services and architecture in a relaxing atmosphere. Also opened at about the same time were tennis courts and Thailand’s first golf course – The Royal Hua Hin Golf Course, designed by a scottish engineer A O Robins.with sufficient accommodation.\n\nThe southern cities has been a popular resort destination in Siam. The introduction of steam engine ships and the extending railway operations to the south had also made transportation easier. Before Hua Hin was found, in the city of Petchaburi, a major trade&cultural city north of Hua Hin, already situated two beautiful royal palaces – King Rama IV’s Phra Nakorn Kiri (Thai พระนครคีรี – Mountain Palace) and King Rama V’s Phra Rama Rajanives (Thai พระรามราชนิเวศน์). With more exploration and travels by the royalties and state officers, commerce and tourism in the area also got further developed.\n\nIn 1924, shortly after the openings of a luxury hotel and the royal golf course in Hua Hin, the construction of a summer palace for King Rama VI was completed. Marukhathayawan Palace (Thai พระราชนิเวศน์มฤคทายวัน) is peacefully located on a beach midway between Cha-am and Hua Hin. The beautiful seaside palace was in gingerbread architecture style with Thai influence. It features picturesque golden teak buildings in pastel paints; all buildings and corridors are raised high above the ground and interlinked by covered boardwalks. The Marukhathayawan Palace received royal visits during the last 2 years of King Rama VI’s reign. Nowadays, this palace was recently renovated and opens to visitors who wish to admire the beauty of the old days.\n\nWith frequent visits by the kings, royal households and state officers, more people had come to experience the serene beach resort and fall in love with Hua Hin charms.\n\nPhra Ratchawang Klai Kangwon (Thai พระราชวังไกลกังวล) was complete in 1928 during the reign of King Rama VII, after King Rama VII had often visited Hua Hin by borrowing Sukaves royal residence from his uncle Prince Nares and later decided to build a summer residence for Queen Rambhaibhannee on HM King’s own private fund. The word Klai Kangwon means ‘Far from Worries’. The palace is built in Mediterranian style with Thai influence under the direction of MJ tthidhepsan Krissadakorn, a graduate of …cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts and was Siam’s Principle of Art Institute at that time. Within the palace are four royal mansions with their names in rhyme – Piemsuk – Plukkasem – ErbPreme – EmmePredi. Piemsuk royal mansion sits in the center with brown roof tiles, light brown painted walls and arched doorways.\n\nHua Hin witnessed a major turning point of Siam – a bloodless coup on 24 June 1932 – which changed the country’s absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. On that date King Rama VII was at Hua Hin. The message from the coup in Bangkok arrived the King at the Royal Golf Course. It was from Klai Kang Won Palace the next day, 25 June 1932, that King Rama VII made a highly regarded decision to peacefully consent to the demanded terms and give consitution power to Siamese citizens – a caring decision not only in line with HM’s will but also intended to avoid bloodshed or civil war in the country, and to ensure the nation would stay strong and independent through the difficult time.\n\nAfterwards Hua Hin slowly progressed through the turn of time. The stereotyped picture of Hua Hin slowly changed from a royal & society retreat into a beach destination for younger generations. The beach resort continued its fame although with noticably less social activities due to political concerns. After the political changes came the war time, Hua Hin was unscathed through the World War II but went gloomy due to damaged routes to Bangkok.\n\nLike a sunny sky after stormy weather, the new glory of Hua Hin was restored in the reign of King Rama IX. King Bhumibhol and Queen Sirikit visit Hua Hin often and brought care and attention to all citizens. HM’s vacation time has been spent on visits to remote villages to witness hardship of Thai people. The first royal project to fight against drought was initiated for a community south of Hua Hin. Until today, hundreds of royal projects have been accomplished under HM King Bhumibhol’s objective to fight against drought and improve living standard of his citizens."
