The 2008 United States presidential election was the 56th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. The Republican ticket of Mitt Romney, the Governor of Massachusetts, and John Sununu, the junior U.S. Senator from New Hampshire, defeated the Democratic ticket of Dennis Kucinich, U.S. Representative from Ohio and former Mayor of Cleveland, and Howard Dean, the former Governor of Vermont. Romney's victory ended a string of Democratic presidential wins that extended back to 1996.

Incumbent Democratic President Al Gore was ineligible to pursue a third term due to term limits established by the 22nd Amendment. Romney secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, defeating former Governors Mike Hucakbee and Jim Gilmore, former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani, and former Senator Fred Thompson, among other challengers. With Vice−President Joe Lieberman declining to pursue the nomination, the Democratic primaries were marked by a sharp contest between Kucinich and Dean, each of whom considered themselves the standard−bearer of the liberal cause within the Party. After a long primary season, Kucinich secured the Democratic presidential nomination in June 2008, and in a bid to heal tensions from the primaries, selected Dean as his running mate.

Both major−party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored, with Romney calling for a tougher line towards China and Russia. Romney highlighted his executive experience as Governor of Massachusetts, adopted a moderate tone on divisive social issues such as gay rights and abortion, and sought to frame himself as a "compassionate conservative", who could work across the aisle with Democrats and independents to get things done. Kucinich, on his part, called for universal healthcare, the elimination of student loan debt, and the creation of extensive new jobs and subsidy programs, geared at blue−collar workers and minority communities. Ultimately, Romney was able to capitalize on the country's desire for change, and Kucinich did not actively campaign with President Gore, with whom he had ideological disagreements, and who had opposed his nomination bid.

Romney won a decisive victory, winning the Electoral College and popular vote by landslide margins. He carried 49 of the 50 states. Kucinich won only Illinois and the District of Columbia. Romney's total popular vote count (77.5 million votes) and margin of victory (24.6 million votes) stood as the largest ever won by a presidential candidate until 2016. Republicans expanded their majority in the U.S. Senate and won control of the U.S. House.

Results[]

The total vote exceeded that of 2004 by nine million, which was an increase of 35 million over the vote cast in 1996 and 50 million more than that of 1976. Every section in the Union increased its vote, with the fast−growing Sun Belt states of California, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Georgia recording the most significant increases. California, in fact, experienced an increase of more than one million votes.

Romney won the election by a landslide margin, carrying 49 states and winning an overwhelming 514 electoral votes. The 77,528,153 votes cast for Romney was the greatest number of votes ever won by a presidential candidate until then and constituted an increase of more than 28,726,583 over the Smith vote four years earlier. Romney's margin of victory – 24,593,784 – was the largest margin of victory for any presidential candidate in history. Kucinich carried Illinois and the District of Columbia with 24 electoral votes.

Romney's top 10 states were an interesting set of geographic disparities. They included Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming in the Mountain West; New Hampshire in the Northeast; Alabama and Georgia in the Deep South; and Nebraska, North Dakota, and Kansas on the Great Plains. Kucinich's top 10 included the traditionally Democratic states of Hawaii and Rhode Island. They also included four Midwestern states – Illinois (his only state victory), Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, two additional Northeastern states - Maryland and New York, and two states on the West Coast - Oregon and Washington.

Kucinich's victory in Illinois made him the first losing Democrat to carry that state since Lewis Cass in 1848, and the first to do so against a Republican.

There was a nearly universal Republican trend throughout the country. Romney carried 1,520 counties that had gone for Gore in 2004. He flipped at least one county in every state. In eleven states, the Kucinich−Dean ticket failed to carry a single county.[lower-alpha 1] Not one county shifted from Smith in 2004 to Kucinich in 2008, although Kucinich did run ahead of Gore in a number of counties he failed to carry. Kucinich carried 251 counties (7.99%), the fewest number of counties carried by a major−party presidential candidate since George McGovern in 1972.[lower-alpha 2] The Republican total leaped to 2,892 counties (92.01%), the largest number of counties carried by a presidential candidate since that election. Romney won a majority of votes in 2,876 counties, while Kucinich won a majority in 241. Romney became the first Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1992 to win at least one county in every state.[lower-alpha 3] He carried all 26 counties which had voted for Donald Trump in 2000, and he won Trump's 2004 voters by a ratio of 3−1 over Kucinich.

In the nation's 23 most populous counties (metropolitan America), Romney beat Kucinich, amassing 11,453,043 votes (51.29%) to Kucinich's 10,687,063 (47.86%). Romney's margin of victory in these counties was 765,980 votes, or 3.43%. This was the first time a Republican had won the metropolitan vote since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Third parties received 190,105 votes (0.85%). In the remainder of the country, Romney routed Kucinich, amassing 66,075,110 votes (60.63%) to Kucinich's 42,247,306 (38.76%). Third parties received 661,193 votes (0.61%). Romney's margin of victory in non−metropolitan America was 23,827,804 votes, or 21.87%.

With two−time Reform Party nominee Donald Trump declining to mount a third presidential bid, third−party support sank almost to the vanishing point, as the election of 2008 proved to be the first genuinely two−party contest since Mario Cuomo's election in 1996. All "Other" votes totaled only 0.65% of the national vote, and in nineteen states and the District of Columbia, there was no third−party vote.[lower-alpha 4]
