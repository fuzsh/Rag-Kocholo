        "text": "WASHINGTON — There is a long tradition of presidential candidates ratcheting up their language when they are trailing in the closing weeks of an election.\n\nBut in the same fashion Donald J. Trump has broken with other political traditions, he is taking a longstanding rite of fall to new heights — or perhaps new lows.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday alone, Mr. Trump unleashed a barrage of near-apocalyptic warnings about the potential destruction of the country, broad accusations about the illegitimacy of American democracy, and crude innuendo about his opponent that is almost without precedent in modern presidential history.\n\nHe warned that Hillary Clinton was conspiring with financiers to destroy American sovereignty, claimed the fate of civilization depended on his victory and ridiculed the appearance of the one of the women accusing him of sexual harassment, while also deriding Mrs. Clinton’s looks and saying she ought to be in prison. He also said the presidential election amounted to “a big ugly lie.”\n\nWhile delighting his partisans, Mr. Trump’s rhetorical shooting spree has enraged Democrats and unnerved many Republicans, who believe he is acting out a political death wish.\n\nHere are some of Mr. Trump’s own words and how they compare to the attacks wielded by some previous presidential candidates — language that was, at the time, considered inflammatory or controversial but which now seems quaint by comparison:\n\n“Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.”\n\n— Mr. Trump at a rally on Thursday in West Palm Beach, Fla."
