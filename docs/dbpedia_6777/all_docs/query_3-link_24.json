WILLIAM PELHAM BARR TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES ---------- TUESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2019 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:32 a.m., in Room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Lindsey O. Graham, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Graham [presiding], Grassley, Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, Sasse, Hawley, Tillis, Ernst, Crapo, Kennedy, Blackburn, Feinstein, Leahy, Durbin, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Coons, Blumenthal, Hirono, Booker, and Harris. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA Chairman Graham. Thank you, all. You are not going to get a good shot of me. So, thank you, all. So, Happy New Year, New Congress, and we will see how this goes. I recognize Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. Okay. I do this with a point of personal privilege, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate that courtesy of you and the Members. This is the first meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee in this 116th Congress. It is also the first time that we convene while my friend Lindsey Graham holds the gavel and will proceed to be Chairman. So I would like to congratulate the new Chairman, thank him for his leadership, and say that I look forward to working with you and the other Members of this Committee as we seek to address some of our Nation's most pressing problems. I have every confidence that you will steer our 200-year-old Committee in the right direction. Chairman Graham. Well, thank you. I really appreciate that. In my view, nobody looks over 100, so we are actually--we are aging well as a Committee. The bottom line is, how do you get this job? Your colleagues have to vote for you. Thank you. You have to get re- elected and outlive the person to your right. So I have been able to do that. And I look forward to working with Senator Feinstein, who is--I have a lot of affection and fondness for. She, to me, represents a seriousness that the body needs and a demeanor that I think we should all aspire to. To the new colleagues--Senators Hawley, Blackburn, and Ernst--thank you for being part of this Committee. To Senators Blackburn and Ernst, thank you for making history, I think, on our side. As to the hopes and dreams for this Committee, to get as much done as possible and to fight when we have to over things that matter to the public and show two different views of an issue that is important, but do it as respectfully as possible. Sentencing reform. Criminal justice reform was a very big deal, and this Committee delivered for the country. Senator Durbin, I want to thank you very, very much for working with Senator Lee and Senator Grassley and Senator Booker. That is a big deal that is going to change lives, I think, in a positive way. So this Committee has within it the ability to do big things long overdue. I know Senator Blackburn wants to do something on social media. Senator Klobuchar has got some ideas about how to make sure if you put an ad up on social media, you have to stand by it. We are all worried about social media platforms being hijacked by terrorists and bad actors throughout the international world. We are worried about privacy. Do you really know what you are signing up for when you get on one of these platforms? I would like this Committee working with Commerce to see if we can find some way to tame the ``wild West.'' Intellectual property. Senator Tillis and Senator Coons have some ideas that I look forward to hearing about. Senator Sasse wants to make sure that we act ethically. You have got a package of ethic reforms, and I look forward to working with you there. On this side, I know there are a lot of ideas that I am sure that if we sat down and talked we could embrace, and I look forward to solving as many problems as we can and having a contest over ideas that really matter to the American people. Senator Hatch, thank you for coming. In terms of my Chairmanship, if I can do what you and Senator Grassley were able to do during your time, I will have done the Committee a good service. Senator Grassley, thank you very much. Last year was tough, but I think you and Senator Feinstein did the best you could in the environment in which we live. The times in which we live are very difficult times. I do not see them getting better overnight, but I do see them getting better if we all want them to. So, about me, I want us to do better, and I will be as measured as possible. The Immigration Lindsey will show up, but the other guy is there, too, and I do not like him any more than you do. So the bottom line is, we are starting off with something that would be good for the country. We have a vacancy for the Attorney General spot. We have a chance to fill that vacancy. Mr. Barr, you cannot hold a job. When you look at what he has done in his life, it is incredible. So I want to thank the President for nominating somebody who is worthy of the job, who will understand on day one what the job is about and can right the ship over there. I think we all have concerns. I know Senator Whitehouse is passionate about cybersecurity and ``Fort Cyber'' and all of these other ideas that Sheldon has been pushing. It is just a matter of time before we are hit and hit hard if somebody does not step up to the plate with some solutions. But a little bit about the nominee. He has been Attorney General before, from 1991 to 1993 by voice vote. Those were the days. Deputy Attorney General from 1990 to 1991, unanimous consent without a recorded vote. Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, voice vote. That is pretty amazing. I think you are going to have an actual vote this time. Academically gifted: George Washington Law School, Columbia University undergraduate. Outside of DOJ, he was the General Counsel, Legislative Counsel for the CIA. That is how he met Bush 41. He has been a law clerk. He has worked in private practice. I am not going to bore the Committee with all the things he has done. He has been the senior vice president and general counsel of GTE. He has lived a consequential life--general counsel of Verizon. You have lived a life that I think has been honorable and noteworthy and accomplished, and I want to thank you for being willing to take this task on. We have got a lot of problems at the Department of Justice. I think morale is low, and we need to change that. So I will look forward to this hearing. You will be challenged. You should be challenged. The memo, there will be a lot of talk about it, as there should be. But I just want to let you know, Mr. Barr, that we appreciate you stepping up at a time when the country needs somebody of your background and your temperament to be in charge of the rule of law. And with that, I will turn it over to my colleague, Senator Feinstein. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Feinstein. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. And I want you to know I really look forward to working with you. Chairman Graham. Me, too. Senator Feinstein. And I think we can work productively together. And Senator Grassley, I want to thank you for the time we worked together. It really was a pleasure, and I had an opportunity to get to know you as the fine person that you are. So thank you very much. I want to say just one word or two or three about women. Twenty-five years ago, there were no women on this Committee. I will never forget watching the Anita Hill hearing on a television in the London airport with a lot of people gathered around. So I went over to take a look, and I saw, and I saw this all-male Judiciary Committee. And it took all these years, but here we are. And I want to particularly welcome Senator Ernst and Senator Blackburn. I think it is extraordinarily important that this Committee be representative of our society at large and that we are growing that way, and so thank you very much for being here. I would also like to welcome Bill Barr and his family. I know you are proud to be here, and you served as Attorney General before from 1991 to 1993, and I think we all have great respect for your commitment to public service. When we met, your previous tenure marked a very different-- we talked about a very different time for our country, and today, we find ourselves in a unique time with a different administration and different challenges. And now, perhaps more than ever before, the country needs someone who will uphold the rule of law, defend the independence of the Justice Department, and truly understand their job is to serve as the people's lawyer, not the President's lawyer. Top of mind for all of us is the ongoing Mueller investigation. Importantly, the Attorney General must be willing to resist political pressure and be committed to protecting this investigation. I am pleased that in our private meeting, as well as in your written statement submitted to the Committee, you stated that it is vitally important--and this is a quote--that ``the Special Counsel be allowed to complete his investigation'' and that ``the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel's work.'' However, there are at least two aspects of Mr. Mueller's investigation: first, Russian interference in the United States election and whether any U.S. persons were involved in that interference and, second, possible obstruction of justice. It is the second component that you have written on. And just 5 months before you were nominated, I spent the weekend on your 19-page legal memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticizing Mueller's investigation, specifically the investigation into potential obstruction of justice. In the memo, you conclude, I think, that Special Counsel Mueller is ``grossly irresponsible for pursuing an obstruction case against the President and pursuing the obstruction inquiry is fatally misconceived.'' So, I hope we can straighten that out in this hearing. But your memo also shows a large, sweeping view of presidential authority and determined effort, I thought, to undermine Bob Mueller, even though you state you have been friends and are in the dark about many of the facts of the investigation. So it does raise questions about your willingness to reach conclusions before knowing the facts and whether you prejudge the Mueller investigation. And I hope you will make that clear today. It also raises a number of serious questions about your views on Executive authority and whether the President is, in fact, above the law. For example, you wrote, ``The President''--and I quote--``alone is the executive branch. As such, he is the sole repository of all Executive powers conferred by the Constitution. Thus, the full measure of law enforcement authority is placed in the President's hands, and no limit is placed on the kinds of cases subject to his control and supervision.'' This is in your memo on page 10, and I will ask you about it. This analysis included cases involving potential misconduct, where you concluded, and I quote, ``The President may exercise his supervisory authority over cases dealing with his own interests, and the President transgresses no legal limitation when he does so.'' That is on page 12. In fact, you went so far as to conclude that, ``The Framers' plan contemplates that the President's law enforcement powers extend to all matters, including those in which he has a personal stake.'' You also wrote, ``The Constitution itself places no limit on the President's authority to act on matters which concern him or his own conduct.'' Page 10. Later, you conceded that certain supervisory actions, such as the firing of Director Comey, may be unlawful obstruction. However, this, too, is qualified. You argue that in such a case, obstruction of justice occurs only if, first, a prosecutor proves that the President or his aides colluded with Russia. Specifically, you conclude, and I quote, ``The issue of obstruction only becomes ripe after the alleged collusion by the President or his campaign is established first.'' So that is some of the things I hope to ask you about. And in conclusion, let me just say that some of your past statements on the role of Attorney General and presidential power are concerning. For instance, you have said in the past that the Attorney General is the President's lawyer. In November 2017, you made comments suggesting it would be permissible for the President to direct the Justice Department to open an investigation into his political opponents, and this is notable in light of President Trump's repeated calls for the investigation of Hillary Clinton and others who disagree with him. I believe it is important that the next Attorney General be able to strongly resist pressure, whether from the administration or Congress, to conduct investigations for political purposes. He must have the integrity, the strength, and the fortitude to tell the President no, regardless of the consequences. In short, he must be willing to defend the independence of the Justice Department. So my questions will be do you have that strength and commitment to be independent of the White House pressures you will undoubtedly face? Will you protect the integrity of the Justice Department above all else? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Feinstein appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Graham. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Hatch, welcome back. We truly miss you. You were a great Chairman and an incredible Member of this body, and you are very welcome to share your thoughts about Mr. Barr with this Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH FORMER U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. Well, thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein as well, and Members of the Committee. It is my distinct pleasure to be here today to introduce William Barr, the President's nominee to be Attorney General of the United States. I have known and worked with Bill closely over the years and am glad to call him a friend. Bill has had a distinguished career in public service and in the private sector. He started his career at the Central Intelligence Agency. While there, he went to law school part time at George Washington University. Following graduation, he was selected for a prestigious clerkship with a Federal Judge on the D.C. Circuit before heading to private practice. Later, he served in the Reagan White House in the Office of Policy Development. Following another stint in private practice, Bill began his distinguished career at the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. Bill served as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, then as Deputy Attorney General, and finally, as Attorney General of the United States. As Attorney General, Bill oversaw a number of sensitive criminal investigations, including the investigation into the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. He prioritized fighting violent crime and became known as a law and order Attorney General. Throughout his time at the Justice Department, Bill earned a reputation as a fierce advocate for the rule of law, as a principled and independent decisionmaker, and as a lawyer's lawyer. He has shown his commitment to the Constitution time and time again while serving our country. That is why he has been confirmed by the Senate unanimously three times. After completing his service at the DOJ, Bill returned to the private sector, working at law firms and as Counsel for some of America's largest companies. I could do--I could go on at length describing Bill's distinguished career. There is no question, none whatsoever, that Bill is well qualified to serve as Attorney General. He has held this position before and won high praise during his tenure for his fairness, his tenacity, and his work ethic. So instead of droning on about Bill's resume, I want to tell you about what Bill identifies as the most important achievement of his private service as Attorney General, at least, I believe this is what he believes. I believe his answer tells you much about how he will approach the job and who he is. When asked what his most important accomplishment was as Attorney General, Bill does not point to one of his many policy successes. He does not talk about his role in setting antitrust merger guidelines. He does not say it was his role leading the DOJ's response to the savings and loan crisis. No, for him, it was something more. It was something more tangible. It was Talladega. Three days after Bill was named Acting Attorney General by President Bush, 121 prisoners noted and seized control of the Talladega Federal Correctional Institution in Alabama. This was a very serious matter, and they took 10 hostages. Planning at the DOJ began immediately for how best to resolve the situation and secure the safe release of the hostages. In such a situation, some would have sought political cover, not Bill. He was in charge. He knew the response was his decision to make, his responsibility. He maintained his focus on the safety of the men and women held hostage by the prisoners. The standoff lasted 10 days. Then on Bill's order, FBI agents stormed the prison. Three minutes later, it was over. The hostages were safe. The mission was well planned and executed. The Federal agents did not even have to fire a single shot. Bill's decisionmaking and judgment helped save lives. When President Bush nominated Bill to be Attorney General in 1991, I noted why he had been selected. He was not a member of President Bush's political or personal inner circle. He was not a part of the President's brain trust. He was not a politician or former politician who brought political clout to the position from prior elections or prior elected office. Bill Barr was a lawyer's lawyer. Talent, merit, and performance-- those were the reasons President Bush selected him to be the Attorney General at that time. That statement holds true today. Bill Barr, in my opinion, is an outstanding choice for Attorney General. His vast experience, renowned judgment, and reputation as an ardent defender of the rule of law make him a nominee that the American people, the President, and the Senate should all be proud of. So I feel very honored to be here today to speak in his favor, and I hope that his nomination will be approved expeditiously. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Thanks, Senator Hatch. I would like to note at the outset that the Rules of the Senate prohibit outbursts, clapping, or demonstrations of any kind. This includes blocking the view of people around you. Please be mindful of these rules as we conduct this hearing. I will ask the Capitol Police to remove anyone who violates the rules of this Committee. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Mr. Barr, would you come forward, please? Chairman Graham. Raise your right hand, please. Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give to this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? General Barr. I do. Chairman Graham. The floor is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM PELHAM BARR, NOMINEE TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES General Barr. Before I begin, Mr. Chairman, could I introduce my family? Chairman Graham. Absolutely. General Barr. My wife of 46 years, Christine, a retired librarian. My daughter Margaret, who we call Meg, she was an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Columbia, but now has moved up to Capitol Hill and works for Senator Braun. My middle daughter, Patricia, who is also an attorney, and she has been Counsel to the House Agriculture Committee for how long now, Patty, 10--11 years. And my daughter Mary, who is a longtime Federal prosecutor and is currently the coordinator for opioid enforcement in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. Mary's husband, Mike, who is also an attorney at the Department of Justice in the National Security Division, and their son--Mary and Mike's son--Liam, who will someday be in the Department of Justice. [Laughter.] General Barr. Patricia's husband, Pelham, who is a founding partner of a consulting firm. And Meg's husband, Tyler, who is also an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Did I leave anyone out? Chairman Graham. Think about medical school, Liam. [Laughter.] Chairman Graham. Somebody needs to make money in the family. General Barr. When Meg was starting at Notre Dame, I told her I wanted a doctor in the family, and I made her take organic chem. Needless to say, she is now a lawyer. So---- Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee. It is a privilege to come before you today, and I am honored that President Trump has nominated me for the position of Attorney General. I regret that I come before this Committee at a time when much of our Government is shut down, and my thoughts are with the dedicated men and women of the Department of Justice and other Federal workers, many of whom continue to perform their critical jobs. As you know, if the Senate confirms me, this would be my second time I would have the honor of holding this office. During the 4 years I served under President George H.W. Bush, he nominated me for three successive positions in the Department--the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, the Deputy Attorney General, and finally, the Attorney General--and this Committee unanimously approved me for each of those offices. Twenty-seven years ago at my confirmation hearing, I explained that the office of Attorney General is not like any other Cabinet post. It is unique and has a critical role to play under our constitutional system. I said then, the Attorney General has a very special obligation, unique obligations. He holds in trust the fair and impartial administration of justice. It is the Attorney General's responsibility to enforce the law evenhandedly and with integrity. The Attorney General must ensure that the administration of justice, the enforcement of the law, is above and away from politics. Nothing could be more destructive of our system of Government, of the rule of law, or the Department of Justice as an institution, than any toleration of political interference with the enforcement of the law. I believe this as strongly today as I did 27 years ago, indeed, more strongly. We live in a time when the country is deeply divided. In the current environment, the American people have to know that there are places in the Government where the rule of law, not politics, holds sway and where they will be treated fairly based solely on the facts and the evenhanded application of the law. The Department of Justice must be that place. I did not pursue this position, and when my name was first raised, I was reluctant to be considered and, indeed, proposed a number of alternative candidates. I am 68 years old, partially retired, and nearing the end of a long legal career. My wife and I were looking forward to a peaceful and cherished time with our daughters and grandchildren. And I have had this job before. But ultimately, I agreed to serve because I believe strongly in public service, I revere the law, I love the Department of Justice and the dedicated professionals who serve there, and I believe that I can do a good job leading the Department in these times. If confirmed, I will serve with the same independence I did in 1991. At that time, when President Bush chose me, he sought no promises and asked only that his Attorney General act with professionalism and integrity. Likewise, President Trump has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied, and I have not given him any, other than that I would run the Department with professionalism and integrity. As Attorney General, my allegiance will be to the rule of law, the Constitution, and the American people. This is how it should be, this is how it must be, and if you confirm me, this is how it will be. Now let me address a few matters I know are on the minds of some of the Members of this Committee. First, I believe it is vitally important that the Special Counsel be allowed to complete his investigation. I have known Bob Mueller for 30 years. We worked closely together throughout my previous tenure at the Department of Justice. We have been friends since, and I have the utmost respect for Bob and his distinguished record of public service. And when he was named Special Counsel, I said his selection was good news and that, knowing him, I had confidence he would handle the matter properly. And I still have that confidence today. Given his public actions to date, I expect that the Special Counsel is well along in his investigation. At the same time, the President has been steadfast that he was not involved in any collusion with Russian attempts to interfere in the election. I believe it is in the best interest of everyone--the President, Congress, and the American people--that this matter be resolved by allowing the Special Counsel to complete his work. The country needs a credible resolution to these issues, and if confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation. I will follow the Special Counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to finish his work. Second, I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel's work. My goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can, consistent with the law. I can assure you that where judgments are to be made, I will make those judgments based solely on the law, and I will not let personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision. Third, I would like to briefly address the memorandum that I wrote last June. I wrote the memo as a former Attorney General who has often weighed in on legal issues of public importance, and I distributed it broadly so that other lawyers would have the benefit of my views. My memo was narrow, explaining my thinking on a specific obstruction of justice theory under a single statute that I thought, based on media reports, the Special Counsel might be considering. The memo did not address or in any other way question the Special Counsel's core investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the election, nor did it address other potential obstruction of justice theories or argue, that some have wrongly suggested, that a President can never obstruct justice. I wrote it myself on my initiative without any assistance and based solely on public information. I would like to comment very briefly on my priorities, if confirmed as Attorney General. First, we must continue the progress we have made on violent crime, while at the same time recognize the changes that have occurred since I last served as Attorney General. The recently passed First Step Act, which I intend to diligently implement if confirmed, recognizes the progress we have made over the past 3 decades in fighting violent crime. As Attorney General, I will ensure that we will continue our efforts to combat violent crime. In the past, I was focused on predatory violence, but today I am also concerned about another kind of violence. We can only survive and thrive as a Nation if we are mutually tolerant of each other's differences, whether they be differences based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or political thinking. And yet we see some people violently attacking others simply because of their differences. We must have zero tolerance for such crimes, and I will make this a priority as Attorney General, if confirmed. Next, the Department will continue to prioritize enforcing and improving our immigration laws. As a Nation, we have the most liberal and expansive immigration laws in the world. Legal immigration has historically been a huge benefit to this country. However, as we open our front door and try to admit people in an orderly way, we cannot allow others to flout our legal system by crashing in through the back doors. In order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we must secure our Nation's borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold, and remove those who unlawfully enter. Finally, in a democracy like ours, the right to vote is paramount. In a period of great political division, one of the foundations of our Nation is our enduring commitment to the peaceful transition of power through elections. If confirmed, I will ensure that the full might of our resources are brought to bear against foreign persons who unlawfully interfere in our elections. Fostering confidence in the outcomes of elections also means ensuring that the right to vote is fully protected as well as ensuring the integrity of elections. Let me conclude by making the point that over the long run, the course of justice in this country has more to do with the character of the Department of Justice as an enduring institution than with the tenure of any particular Attorney General. Above all else, if confirmed, I will work diligently to protect the professionalism and integrity of the Department as an institution, and I will strive to leave it and the Nation a stronger and better place. Thank you very much for your time today, and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of General Barr appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Graham. Thank you, Mr. Barr. We will try to break around 11:30, I think, to get a quick bite and break up the day for you. But one thing I want to tell you is, that I support the idea that politicians, no matter of what Party, should not interfere with criminal investigations. That makes imminent sense to me. Once you go down that road, then the rule of law collapses. But there is another side to this equation--if I may say, a two-way street. What about those in charge of enforcing the law? What about those with the power to bring charges against American citizens, including people up here? I remember Senator Stevens' case in Alaska. So, we should always be on guard about the politician interfering in an investigation, but we should also have oversight of how the Department works, and those with this tremendous power use that power. Are you familiar with the January 11th New York Times article about, ``FBI Opened Inquiry Into Whether Trump Was Secretly Working on Behalf of Russia''? General Barr. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Would you promise me and this Committee to look into this and tell us whether or not, in the appropriate way, a counterintelligence investigation was opened up by somebody at the FBI, Department of Justice against President Trump? General Barr. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I think there are a number of investigations, as I understand it, going on in the Department. Chairman Graham. Have you ever heard of such a thing in all the time you have been associated with the Department of Justice? General Barr. I have never heard of that. Chairman Graham. Are there rules about how you can do counterintelligence investigations? General Barr. I believe there are, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. So if you want to open up one against the President, are there any checks and balances? General Barr. Not outside the FBI. Chairman Graham. Okay. Well, we need to look at that. In terms of people who are actually enforcing the law, don't we want to make sure they don't have an agenda? General Barr. That is right, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Do you know a Lisa Page or Peter Strzok? General Barr. I have heard their names. Chairman Graham. But do you know them personally? General Barr. No, I do not. Chairman Graham. This is a message, August 8th, 2016, a text message: ``Trump's not ever going to become President, right? Right? '' Strzok responded, ``No, no, he's not. We'll stop him.'' Strzok was in charge of the Clinton email investigation. Ms. Page worked at the Department of Justice. August 15th, 2016: ``I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office, that there's no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before 40.'' March 4th, 2016, Page to Strzok: ``God, Trump is a loathsome human being.'' October the 20th, 2016: ``Trump is an `F'-ing idiot, is unable to provide a coherent answer.'' To all those who enforce the law, you can have any opinion of us that you like, but you are supposed to do your job without an agenda. Do you promise me as Attorney General, if you get this job, to look in to see what happened in 2016? General Barr. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. How do these statements sit with you? General Barr. I was shocked when I saw them. Chairman Graham. Okay. Please get to the bottom of it. I promise you we will protect the investigation, but we are relying upon you to clean this place up. FISA warrants. Are you familiar with a FISA warrant? General Barr. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Okay. During the process of obtaining a warrant, is there a certification made by the Department of Justice to the court that the information being provided is reliable? General Barr. Yes, sir. Chairman Graham. Are you familiar with Bruce Ohr? General Barr. No, I am not. Chairman Graham. Bruce Ohr was Associate Deputy Attorney General for Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement. His wife worked at Fusion GPS. Are you familiar with Fusion GPS? General Barr. Yes, I have read about that. Chairman Graham. Fusion GPS, Mr. Barr, was hired by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton Campaign to do opposition research against Candidate Trump and maybe other candidates, but we now know that they hired Fusion GPS, Michael Steele, who is a former British agent, to do opposition research and produce the famous dossier. Are you aware that Mr. Ohr's wife worked for that organization? General Barr. I have read that. Chairman Graham. Does that bother you if he had anything to do with the case? General Barr. Yes. Chairman Graham. Are you aware that on numerous occasions, he met with Mr. Steele while his wife worked with Fusion GPS? General Barr. I have read that. Chairman Graham. Okay. The warrant certification against Carter Page on four different occasions certifies that the dossier, which was the main source of the warrant, was reliable. Would you look in to see whether or not that was an accurate statement and hold people accountable if it was not? General Barr. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Mueller. You say you have known Mueller a long time. Would you say you have a close relationship with Mr. Mueller? General Barr. I would say we are good friends. Chairman Graham. Would you say that you understand him to be a fair-minded person? General Barr. Absolutely. Chairman Graham. Do you trust him to be the fair to the President and the country as a whole? General Barr. Yes. Chairman Graham. When his report comes to you, will you share it with us as much as possible? General Barr. Consistent with regulations and the law, yes. Chairman Graham. Do you believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt against anybody? General Barr. I do not--I do not believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt. Chairman Graham. What are the circumstances that would allow a Special Counsel to be appointed, generally speaking? General Barr. Well, I appointed three, Mr. Chairman, Special Counsel. And generally, when something comes up--an issue comes up that needs to be investigated and there are good reasons to have it investigated by a Special Counsel outside the normal chain at the Department, someone usually of public stature that can provide additional assurance of nonpartisan-- -- Chairman Graham. Do you believe that Attorney General Sessions had a conflict because he worked on the Trump Campaign? General Barr. I am not sure of all the facts, but I think he probably did the right thing recusing himself. Chairman Graham. I agree. I think he did the right thing to recuse himself. Do you know Rod Rosenstein? General Barr. Yes, I do. Chairman Graham. What is your opinion of him? General Barr. I have a very high opinion of Rod Rosenstein and his service in the Department. Chairman Graham. Okay. Why did you write the memo? General Barr. I wrote the memo because starting, I think, in June 2017, there were many news reports, and I had no facts, and none of us really outside the Department have facts. But I read a lot of news reports suggesting that there were a number of potential obstruction theories that were being contemplated or, at least, explored. One theory in particular that appeared to be under consideration under a specific statute concerned me because I thought it would involve stretching the statute beyond what was intended, and would do it in a way that would have serious adverse consequences for all agencies that are involved in the administration of justice, especially the Department of Justice. And I thought it would have a chilling effect going forward over time. And my memo is very clear that is the concern that was driving me, the impact, not the particular case, but its impact of a rule over time. And I wanted to make sure that before anyone went down this path, if that was, in fact, being considered, that the full implications of the theory were carefully thought out. So I wanted my views to get in front of the people who would be involved and the various lawyers who would be involved in those discussions. So, I first raised these concerns verbally with Rod Rosenstein when I had lunch with him early in 2008, and when he did not respond and was Sphinx-like in his reaction, expounded on my concerns. And then I later attempted to provide a written analysis as follow-up. Now, I initially thought of an op-ed, and because of the material, it was not working out. And I talked to his staff, and I said, you know, I want to follow up and send something to Rod in writing, but is he a one-pager kind of guy or, you know, how much will he read? And the guy said, he is like you, he does not mind wading into a dense legal memo. Chairman Graham. Don't you think President Trump is a one- pager kind of guy? General Barr. Excuse me? Chairman Graham. President Trump is a one-pager kind of guy. General Barr. I suspect he is. Chairman Graham. Okay. Just remember that. Go ahead. General Barr. Yes. [Laughter.] General Barr. And so I provided the memo to Rod, and I provided it--distributed it freely among the other lawyers that I thought would be interested in it, and I think it was entirely proper. It is very common for me and for other former senior officials to weigh in on matters that they think may be ill advised and may have ramifications down the road. For example, just a few months before that, I had weighed in repeatedly to complain about the idea of prosecuting Senator Menendez. I think I made three calls. I think it was two to Sessions, to AG Sessions, and one to Rosenstein. Now, I did not know Senator Menendez. I do not represent Senator Menendez. No one was paying me to do it, and, in fact, I do not support Senator Menendez politically, but I carefully watched this case. My friend, Abbe Lowell, was his Defense Counsel, and it was very much like a line of cases that I had been concerned about when I was AG. And so I was watching it, and I thought the prosecution was based on a fallacious theory that would have bad long-term consequences. And so I freely weighed in at the Department, and I did so because I care about the rule of law. And I want to say one final thing on the rule of law because it picks up on something you said, Mr. Chairman. What is the rule of law? We all use that term. In the area of enforcement, I think the rule of law is that when you apply a rule to A, it has to be the rule and approach you apply to B, C, D, and E, and so forth. And that seems to me to suggest two corollaries for an Attorney General. The first, that is why we do not like political interference. Political interference means that the rule being applied to A is not the rule you are applying. It is special treatment because someone is in there exerting political influence. The corollary to that, and this is what you are driving at, Mr. Chairman, is that when you apply a rule--when a prosecutor is applying a rule to A, you got to be careful that it is not torqued specially for that case in a way that could not be applied down the road, or if it is applied, will create problems down the road. And I think the Attorney General's job is both. It is both to protect against interference, but it is also to provide oversight to make sure that in each individual case, the same rule that would be applied broadly is being applied to the individual. Chairman Graham. Senator Feinstein. Senator Feinstein. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Six quick ``yes'' or ``no'' questions. Will you commit to no interference with the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation? General Barr. I will--the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation---- Senator Feinstein. By not---- General Barr [continuing]. Is set by his charter and by the regulations, and I will ensure that those are maintained. Senator Feinstein. Will you commit to providing Mr. Mueller with the resources, funds, and time needed to complete his investigation? General Barr. Yes. Senator Feinstein. Will you commit to ensuring that Special Counsel Mueller is not terminated without good cause consistent with Department regulations? General Barr. Absolutely. Senator Feinstein. If the Special Counsel makes any request, for instance, about the scope of investigation or resources for his investigation, will you commit to notifying Congress if you deny that request? General Barr. I think the regulations require notification of Congress if there is a disagreement. Senator Feinstein. Thank you. And I have two questions from the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Will you commit to making any report Mueller produces at the conclusion of his investigation available to Congress and to the public? General Barr. As I said in my statement, I am going to make as much information available as I can, consistent with the rules and regulations that are part of the Special Counsel regulations. Senator Feinstein. Will you commit to making any report on the obstruction of justice public? General Barr. That is the same answer. Yes. Senator Feinstein. Thank you. In your June 2018 memo about obstruction of justice to the Mueller investigation, you repeatedly referred to Mr. Mueller's ``sweeping and all- encompassing interpretation of Section 1512,'' which is the--a statute on obstruction. How do you know what Mr. Mueller's interpretation of 1512 is? General Barr. Well, as I said, I was--I was speculating. I freely said at the beginning I was writing in the dark, and we are all in the dark. Every lawyer, every talking head, everyone who thinks about or talks about it does not have the facts. Senator Feinstein. So I spent my Saturday reading that memorandum. General Barr. Yes. Senator Feinstein. So are you saying this is all your speculation? It is a big memo. General Barr. Well, it was informed to the extent that I thought that that was one of the theories being considered. I do not know how seriously--whether it was being considered or how seriously it was being considered. But I--as a shorthand way in the memo of referring to what I was speculating might be the theory, I referred to it as ``Mr. Mueller's theory'' rather than go in every time I mention it say, well, this is speculative. Senator Feinstein. But do you know what Mueller's interpretation of 1512 is? General Barr. No, I do not know what Mueller's interpretation. Senator Feinstein. Okay. General Barr. And just one point, Senator. I think--you said in your opening statement I said he was grossly irresponsible. I think I said if something happens, it would be grossly irresponsible. I was not calling Mueller grossly irresponsible. Senator Feinstein. I understand. General Barr. Okay. Senator Feinstein. Thank you. I appreciate that. Has anyone given you non-public information about Mueller's investigation? General Barr. I do not--I do not recall getting any confidential information about the investigation. Senator Feinstein. Your 2018 memo--in it you stated, and I quote, ``The Framers' plan contemplates that the President's law enforcement powers extend to all matters, including those in which he had a personal stake,'' end quote. Please explain what you based this conclusion on. General Barr. Yes. Here is the Department of Justice--right here, and within the Department of Justice, enforcement decisions are being made. The President is over here, and I think of it as, there are two categories of potential communications. One would be on a case that the President wants to communicate about that he has no personal interest in, no political interest in. Let us say, the President is concerned about Chinese stealing trade secrets and says, ``I want you to go after this company that is being--you know, that may be stealing trade secrets.'' That is perfectly appropriate for him to do--to communicate that. But, whether it is bona fide or not, the Department of Justice's obligation and the Attorney General's obligation is not to take any action unless we reach--``we,'' the Department of Justice and the Attorney General--reach their own independent conclusion that it is justified under the law, and regardless of the instruction. And that is my quote that everyone is saying, you know, I am siccing the--you know, it is okay for the--for the President to direct things. All I said was, it is not per se improper for the President to call on the Department for doing something, especially if he has no personal or political interest in it. The other category of cases--and let us pick, you know, an easy bad example--would be if a member of the President's family or a business associate or something was under investigation, and he tries to intervene. He is the chief law enforcement officer, and you could say, well, he has the power, but that would be a breach of his obligation under the Constitution to faithfully execute the laws. So, in my opinion, if he attempts--if a President attempts to intervene in a matter that he has a stake in to protect himself, that should first be looked at as a breach of his constitutional duties--whether it also violates a statute, depending on what statute comes into play, and what all the facts are. Senator Feinstein. Including the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. General Barr. Well, I think there is a dispute as to what the Emoluments Clause relates to. I have not personally researched the Emoluments Clause. I cannot even tell you what it says at this point. Off the top of my head I would have said, well, emoluments are essentially a stipend attached to some office, but I do not know if that is correct or not. But I am sure it is---- Senator Feinstein. Okay. Well---- General Barr. I think it is being litigated right now. Senator Feinstein. I am going to--I do not know either, so I am going to try and find out, and we will come back another day and maybe discuss it. General Barr. Okay. Okay. Senator Feinstein. Your memo stated, ``a fatal flaw in Mueller's interpretation of Sec. 1512(c)(2), is that, while defining obstruction solely as acting `corruptly,' Mueller offers no definition of what `corruptly' means.'' My understanding is that there is nothing in the public record that sheds light on his definition of ``obstruction.'' Do you know what his definition is? General Barr. I do not know what his definition is. I read a book where people were asking whether someone--I think--I do not know if it is accurate, but whether someone--the President was acting with corrupt intent. And what I say in my memo is, actually the--people do not understand what the word ``corruptly'' means in that statute. It is an adverb, and it is not meant to mean with a state of mind. It is actually meant the way in which the influence or obstruction is committed. That is an adverbial function in the statute. And what it means is, using in the 19th century sense, it is meant to influence in a way that changes something that is good and fit to something that is bad and unfit, namely the corruption of evidence or the corruption of a decisionmaker. That is what the word ``corruptly'' means because once you dissociate it from that, it really means--very hard to discern what it means. It means ``bad.'' What does ``bad'' mean? Senator Feinstein. Let me go on because my time is so limited. You argue that the--and I quote, ``The Constitution's plenary grant of those powers to the President also extends to the unitary character of the executive branch itself.'' Specifically you argue, and this is a quote, ``While Mueller's immediate target is the President's exercise of his discretionary powers, his obstruction theory reaches all exercises of prosecutorial distinction by the President's subordinates, from the Attorney General down to the most junior-line prosecutor.'' So, if the President orders the Attorney General to halt a criminal investigation for personal reasons, would that be prohibited under your theory? General Barr. Prohibited by what? Senator Feinstein. By---- General Barr. The Constitution? Senator Feinstein [continuing]. The Constitution. General Barr. I think it would be--I think it would be a breach of the President's duties to faithfully execute the law. It would be an abuse of power. Whether it would violate a statute depends on all the facts and what statute I would-- someone would cite me to. But I certainly think it would be an abuse of his power. And let me just say that the position---- Senator Feinstein. Would that be the same thing if an Attorney General fired U.S. Attorneys for political reasons? General Barr. No, because U.S. Attorneys are political appointments. Senator Feinstein. According to news reports, President Trump interviewed you and asked you to be part of the legal team defending him in the Mueller investigation--twice, first in the spring of 2017 when the investigation was just beginning and again earlier this year. Is that correct? General Barr. No, he--I had one conversation with him that related to his private representation, and I can describe that for you. That was--that was in June 2017. That is the only time I met him before I talked to him about the job of Attorney General, which obviously is not the same as representing him. Senator Feinstein. Have you discussed the Mueller investigation with the President or anyone else in the White House? General Barr. I discussed the Mueller investigation, but not in--not in any particular substance. I can go through my conversations, with you, if you want. Senator Feinstein. Well, not at that time, but I may come back to you---- General Barr. Okay. Senator Feinstein [continuing]. And ask you about that. I do not want to take any more time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. Before I ask my first question, and I do not want you to respond to this. I just want you to know what my interest is in the transparency of the Mueller report. When we spend 35--I do not know whether it is $25 million or $35 million, the taxpayers--that is billions of dollars--the taxpayers ought to know what their money was spent for. So if you have got some reservations about some part of it not being public, I hope that that is related to traditional things that--of the public's business that should not be public, like national security is an example, not being made public. But beyond that, the only way I know for the taxpayers to hold anybody that spend the taxpayers' money responsibly is through transparency because that brings accountability. My first question, and as you would expect from our conversation in my office, in 1986, Reagan signed the False Claims Act. I worked hard to get that passed, especially provisions empowering whistleblowers to help Government identify fraud. More than a decade ago, you said, the qui tam provisions in the False Claims Act were--your words, ``an abomination and were unconstitutional.'' You said, you, in your words, ``wanted to attack the law, but the Supreme Court upheld the law's constitutionality.'' Prosecutors from both sides of the aisle have praised the law as the most effective tool Government has to detect and actually recover public money lost to fraud. Since 1986, the law that was passed in 1986 brought in $56 billion into the Federal treasury. Most of that is because patriotic whistleblowers found the fraud and brought the case to the attention of the Government. Is the False Claims Act unconstitutional? General Barr. No, Senator. It has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Senator Grassley. Do you consider the False Claims Act to be an abomination? General Barr. No, I do not. Senator Grassley. Does the False Claims Act benefit the taxpayer, specifically its provisions to empower and protect whistleblowers? General Barr. Yes, Senator. Senator Grassley. If confirmed, do you commit to not take any action to undermine the False Claims Act? Further, if confirmed, will you continue current Justice Department staff and funding levels to properly support and prosecute False Claims Act cases? General Barr. Yes, I will diligently enforce the False Claims Act. Senator Grassley. Now, with all those positive answers, you would think I would be done, wouldn't you, with that? But let me go on. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. Just to show you that there are some forces out there that I am suspicious about within the Department of Justice, we have a new Department of Justice guidance document out last year, known as the ``Granston Memo.'' It provides a long list of reasons that the Department can use to dismiss False Claims Act cases, some of them pretty darn vague, such as preserving--these are their words: ``preserving Government resources.'' Just think of all the mischief those three words can bring. Of course, the Government can dismiss, obviously, meritless cases. I do not argue with that. But even when the Department declines to participate in False Claims Act cases, the taxpayer can in many cases still recover financially. So it is important to allow whistleblowers to pursue cases even when the Department is not able to be involved. Under what circumstances can or should the Justice Department move to dismiss False Claims cases? General Barr. Senator, I have not reviewed that memorandum, so I am not familiar with the thinking of the people in the--I think it is the Civil Division that did that. But if I am confirmed, I will review it, and I would be glad to come and sit down with you and discuss it, and if there are areas you are concerned about, I would be glad to work with you on that. Senator Grassley. Unless you find that my presumption is wrong, that there are reasons to be suspicious, I hope you will take into consideration my feeling about how in various suspicious ways people that are faceless bureaucrats can undermine this effort. In circumstances where the Government does not intervene in False Claims cases, if confirmed, will you commit to ensuring the Department does not unnecessarily dismiss False Claims Act cases? General Barr. Yes, Senator. I will enforce the law in good faith. Senator Grassley. Okay. Now, we have got an Act that the Justice Department just took, and I cannot obviously expect you to respond specifically to the Act, but I use it as an example of their uncooperation with the Department of Congressional Oversight. This uncooperative behavior needs to change. On December the 10th, last year, the Department confirmed a briefing for your staff regarding the Asset Forfeiture Fund, and to do that last week, January the 8th. On January the 7th, the Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs informed our staff that they will no longer provide the briefing because they consider the matter closed as a result of the change in Chairmanship and because you released a public memo--because I released a public memo on the Marshals Service study or investigation. It is important to gain your commitment on how you would handle this as an example. Let me explain how ridiculous it is to get somebody in this administration saying that they do not have to answer if you are not Chairman of a Committee. We went through this in January, the first month this President was in office, when he said--or he put out a memo, ``We are not going to answer any oversight except for Chairmen of Committees.'' So, you are going to write off 500 Members of Congress not doing oversight. So, we told them all about this and the constitutional cases on this. We got them up. They wrote a memo again 2 months later that said that they were going to respond to all this stuff. Now you have got people in the bowels of the bureaucracy that are still saying, If you are not a Chairman, you ain't going to get an answer to anything. How ridiculous. It is our constitutional responsibility. So then I laid out--I will give you an example. I sent the Justice Department a classified letter regarding information acquired from the Justice Department Inspector General report on the Clinton investigation. The Department ought to answer for what the Attorney Inspector General has found. But I have not heard a peep, not a peep on that yet. On December the 10th, the Justice Department--well, I am repeating here. So the question is: Do you understand that, if you are confirmed, you have an obligation to ensure that the Justice Department--and particularly the FBI is a problem-- respond to congressional inquiries and to do it in a timely manner? General Barr. Absolutely, Senator. Senator Grassley. You understand that this obligation applies regardless of whether you are a Member of Congress or a Committee Chairman? General Barr. Yes, Senator. You know, you and Senator Leahy, I think, are the only Members of the Committee now who were here 27 years ago when I was first confirmed, but I think you will recall that we were able to establish very cooperative and productive relationships with all the Members and try to respond to their questions and deal with their concerns and work with them on projects they are interested in. And that will be the same approach that I will bring to the job if you confirm me. Senator Grassley. Okay. Then let me be specific on my last question on oversight. You remember when you were in my office I gave you, as I gave Attorney General Sessions, as I gave Holder, a long list of things that the Department has not answered. And one of these was an October 17, 2018, letter, and I would like to have your response to answering that letter and respond to all outstanding and future oversight requests in a timely manner. And then, remember, I said all you Cabinet people come up here to tell us ``yes'' when we ask you if you are going to answer our stuff, I said, maybe you better say, ``maybe.'' So if you want to say ``maybe'' now and be really honest, say, ``maybe.'' Otherwise, I hope you will answer that October 17th letter once we get you voted into office. General Barr. Yes, Senator. Senator Grassley. Throughout your career you have expressed concern with congressional attempts to enact criminal justice reform and at times advocated for stricter mandatory minimum sentences. In 1992, under your direction, DOJ published a report entitled, ``The Case for More Incarceration.'' This report declared that the problem with our criminal justice system was that we were incarcerating too few criminals. More recently, in 2015, you signed a letter opposing the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015. This letter states quite clearly your opposition to sentencing reform, particularly the lessening of mandatory minimum sentences and any sort of retroactivity. The First Step Act was signed by President Trump. As Attorney General, it will be your job to implement the legislation. Even though you have opposed criminal justice reform in the past, will you commit to fully implementing the First Step Act? General Barr. Yes, Senator. But, you know, in 1992, when I was Attorney General, the violent crime rates were the highest in American history. The sentences were extremely short. Typically, in many States the time served for rape was 3 years; for murder, time served 5 to 7 years. The system had broken down. And I think through a series of administrations--Reagan, Bush, and Clinton--the laws were changed, and we targeted violent, chronic violent offenders, especially those using guns. And I think the reason the crime rate is much lower today is because of those policies. So I do not think comparing the policies that were in effect in 1992 to the situation now is really fair. And I think--and I have said, that right now we have greater regularity in sentencing. There is broader recognition that chronic violent offenders should be incarcerated for significant periods of time to get them off the streets. And I think the time was right to take stock and make changes to our penal system based on current experience. So I have no problem with the approach of reforming the sentencing structure, and I will faithfully enforce that law. Senator Grassley. Do not take it personal if I raise my voice to you. I am not mad at you. [Laughter.] Chairman Graham. If I were you, I would answer his letters. Just a tip that may help you through your job, if you get it. I will take the time away from my second round. I am very curious about the conversations you had about personal representation or being Attorney General. You mentioned it to Senator Feinstein. Can you just kind of give us a summary of what you were talking about? General Barr. Yes, so in June 2017, the middle of June, Ambassador David Friedman, who is the U.S. Ambassador to Israel--who I did not know. I knew that he was a top-tier lawyer in New York and apparently a friend of the President's. He reached out to me, and we talked one evening, and he said that he--well, my understanding was he was interested in finding lawyers that could augment the defense team, and failing that, he wanted to identify Washington lawyers who had experience, you know, broad experience whose perspective might be useful to the President's. And he asked me a number of questions, like, you know, ``What have you said about the President publicly? '' ``Do you have any conflicts? '' and so forth. And I told him that I did not think I could take this on, that I had just taken on a big corporate client that was very important to me and I expected a lot of work. And I said at my point in life, I really did not want to take on this burden and that I actually preferred the freedom to not have any representation of an individual, but just say what I thought about anything without having to worry about that. And I said that my wife and I were sort of looking forward to a bit of respite and I did not want to stick my head into that meat grinder. He asked me if I would nonetheless meet--briefly go over the next day to meet with the President. And I said, ``Sure, I will go and meet with the President.'' And he brought me over and was squeezing me in--it looked to me like it was before the morning staff meeting because people were grouping by the door to get in, and I went in. And he was there, the Ambassador was there, sat through the meeting. It was a very brief meeting where essentially the President wanted to know--he said, ``Oh, you know Bob Mueller. How well do you know Bob Mueller? '' And I told him how well I knew Bob Mueller and how, you know, the Barrs and Muellers were good friends and would be good friends when this is all over and so forth. And he was interested in that, wanted to know, you know, what I thought about Mueller's integrity and so forth and so on. And I said, ``Bob is a straight shooter and should be dealt with as such.'' And he said something to the effect like, ``So are you envisioning some role here? '' And I said, ``You know, actually, Mr. President, right now I could not do it. Just my personal and my professional obligations are such that I am unable to do it.'' So he asked me for my phone number. I gave it to him, and I never heard from him again until---- Chairman Graham. Well, I tried that once. [Laughter.] Chairman Graham. You did better than---- General Barr. Well, I did not hear from him until, you know, later, but about something different, which was the Attorney General position. Chairman Graham. Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy. Thank you. Mr. Barr, good to see you again. As you mentioned, Senator Grassley and I were here at your hearing a number of years ago. Let me go back even before that. Forty-six years ago, I was not in the Senate. I was State's attorney in Vermont, and I watched with a great deal of interest the Elliot Richardson hearings. He had been nominated to be Attorney General, and it was in the midst of Watergate. He made several commitments to the Committee, including appointing a Special Prosecutor, and he promised to protect his independence. And as one who had total independence as an elected prosecutor in Vermont, I thought how important it was to have that same independence at the national level. And Mr. Richardson said it was necessary to create the maximum possible degree of public confidence in the integrity of the process. I have never forgotten that. I think the integrity of our institutions is just as much at risk today. President Trump has made it clear he views the Justice Department as an extension of his political power. He has called on it to target his opponents. He obsesses over the Russia investigation, which looms over his presidency, may define it. He attacks the Special Counsel almost daily. He fired both the previous FBI Director and Attorney General for not handling the investigation as he pleased. That tells me the rule of law can no longer be taken for granted. So, if confirmed, the President is going to expect you to do his bidding. I can almost guarantee you he will cross the line at some point. That is why the commitments you make here today, just like those I watched Elliot Richardson make years ago, matter greatly. So will you commit, if confirmed, to both seeking and following the advice of the Department's career ethics officials on whether you must recuse from the Special Counsel's investigation? General Barr. I will seek the advice of the career ethics personnel, but under the regulations, I make the decision as the head of the agency as to my own recusal. So I certainly would consult with them, and at the end of the day, I would make a decision in good faith based on the laws and the facts that are evident at that time. Senator Leahy. The same thing if you are talking about a conflict of interest? General Barr. Well, no, some conflicts, as you know, are mandatory. Senator Leahy. I am thinking of what Attorney General Sessions said, when asked a similar question, he said he will seek and follow the advice--seek and follow the advice--of the Department of Justice's designated ethics officials. So let me ask you maybe in a different way. I know you have promised to not interfere with the Special Counsel. Are there any circumstances that would cause you to terminate the investigation or any component of it or significantly restrict its funding? General Barr. Under the regulations, Bob Mueller could only be terminated for good cause, and, frankly, it is unimaginable to me that Bob would ever do anything that gave rise to good cause. But, in theory, if something happened that was good cause, for me it would actually take more than that. It would have to be pretty grave and the public interest would essentially have to compel it, because I believe right now the overarching public interest is to allow him to finish. Senator Leahy. Well, I would agree with that, but I also think over the past 18 months you have rather harshly prejudged the investigation in some of your writings. General Barr. Well, you know, I do not see that at all, Senator. You know, when you strip away a lot of the rhetoric, the two things that have been thrown up as me sort of being antagonistic to the investigation are two things: One, a very mild comment I made that, ``Gee, I wish the team had been more balanced.'' I was not criticizing Mueller. I believe that prosecutors--and I think you would agree--they can handle the case professionally, whatever their politics are. You know, a good prosecutor can leave their politics at the door and go in and do the job. And I think that is what Justice Department prosecutors do in general. Senator Leahy. But you were also very critical of the Russian probe, and, I mean, I cannot think of anything that would--in your memo, for example, that would jump out more for this President because of his commitment to it. And I ask that because some have said, on both sides of the aisle, that it looked like a job application, and so that is what I wanted you to refer to. General Barr. Well, you know, that is ludicrous. If I wanted the job and was going after the job, there are many more direct ways of me bringing myself to the President's attention than writing an 18-page legal memorandum, sending it to the Department of Justice and routing it to other---- Senator Leahy. But you also publicly criticized the Russian probe. I mean---- General Barr. How have I criticized the Russian probe? Senator Leahy. You do not have any criticism of the Russian probe? General Barr. Not at all. I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interfere with the election, and I think we have to get to the bottom of it. Senator Leahy. So you would be in favor of releasing the investigative report when it is completed? General Barr. As I have said, I am in favor of as much transparency as there can be consistent with the rules and the law. Senator Leahy. Do you see a case where the President could claim executive privilege and say that parts of the report could not be released? General Barr. Well, I do not have a clue as to what would be in the report. The report could end up being, you know, not very big. I do not know what is going to be in the report. In theory, if there was executive privilege, material to which an executive privilege claim could be made, it might--you know, someone might raise a claim of executive privilege. Senator Leahy. That would be very difficult following U.S. v. Nixon when the Supreme Court unanimously rejected President Nixon's claims of executive privilege over the Watergate tapes. But I ask it because the President's attorney, Mr. Giuliani, said the President should be able to correct the Mueller report before any public release. So, in other words, he could take this investigative report, put his own spin on it, and correct it before it is released. Do you commit that would not happen if you are Attorney General? General Barr. That will not happen. Senator Leahy. Thank you. You had--when you were AG--I remember this well because I was here in the Senate at the time you encouraged President George H.W. Bush to pardon all six individuals who were targeted in Iran-Contra. The independent prosecutor who investigated the matter labeled that a ``cover-up.'' Now, you and I talked about this in my office, and I appreciate you coming by. I found the conversation the two of us had to be well worthwhile. Do you believe a President could lawfully issue a pardon in exchange for the recipient's promise to not incriminate him? General Barr. No. That would be a crime. Senator Leahy. Thank you. In 1990, you argued that Congress' appropriation power is not an independent source of congressional power to control the allocation of Government resources. There are only three Committees in the Senate that have a Vice Chairman; Appropriations is one of them. Obviously, as Vice Chairman, I kind of looked at that. You claimed that if a President finds no appropriated funds within a given category, he may use funds from another category as long as both categories are in his constitutional purview. Now, as Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, do not be surprised I disagree. Congress' power of the purse, Article I, Section 9, I believe constitutes one of the most fundamental and foundational checks and balances on the executive branch. So do you believe the President can ignore Congress' appropriations, allocations, conditions, and restrictions in law, just ignore them and take the money and transfer---- General Barr. Not as a general proposition, but I--that was---- Senator Leahy. A general proposition---- General Barr. I actually thought that was a good Law Review article. I gave it as a speech, and it was really a thought piece. And what I was really saying was--and I say right up front that the more I thought about the appropriations power, the more confused I got. And I was just laying out a potential template, which is this: People frequently say, you know, the power to spend money on this division or this missile system is part of the power of the purse. And what I was actually saying was--you know, actually, with the power being exercised there is the substantive power that Congress has to raise armies, and it does not come from the power of---- Senator Leahy. It was also specific on appropriations on Agriculture or on Finance. I mean, for example, could the President just build a wall along our southern border because he wanted to and just take the money, whether appropriated or not? What about eminent domain? General Barr. What about eminent domain? Senator Leahy. Well, if you are going to build a wall, you are going to take a whole lot of land away from landowners in Texas and elsewhere. General Barr. Well, you know, you would have to show me what statute is being invoked and also what appropriation is being used. I cannot answer that in the abstract. Senator Leahy. So you are saying the President, though, can have the power to go into money even if the Congress has appropriated it for a different purpose? General Barr. I did not say that, but some have---- Senator Leahy. Do you mean that? General Barr. No, I do not mean that. I am saying that, you know, there are moneys that the President may have power to shift because of statutory authority. Senator Leahy. But that would have been because Congress gave him that authority. General Barr. Right. Senator Leahy. Not because he has it automatically. General Barr. I am not taking that position. As I said, my Law Review--it was published as a Law Review article, and it was a thought piece exploring what limits there might be to the appropriations power and where Congress' power comes from in certain areas. Senator Leahy. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Graham. Just to follow up on that real quick, and I will not take this against Senator Cornyn. Do the Article II powers, the inherent authority of the Commander-in-Chief, give him the ability to take appropriated dollars from the Department of Defense and build a wall? General Barr. I cannot--without looking at the statute, I really could not answer that. Chairman Graham. I am not talking about the statute. I am talking about the inherent authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief. General Barr. That is the kind of question I would go to OLC to answer. Chairman Graham. Okay. Get back with us on that. Senator Cornyn. Senator Cornyn. Well, Mr. Chairman, let me congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and tell you I look forward to working with you and supporting this Committee's efforts. And thank you for convening today's hearing. And I want to express my profound and sincere thanks to the nominee, Mr. Barr, for agreeing to serve a second time as Attorney General. I noted in your statement you said it was 27 years ago that you sat in this chair and went through your first confirmation hearing, and to me that says a lot about your character and your commitment to the rule of law that you would be willing to go through this process again and serve once again as the chief law enforcement officer of the country. Thank you for doing that. General Barr. Thank you, Senator. Senator Cornyn. Thank you to your family as well. To me, the Attorney General is one of the most challenging Cabinet offices to hold because, as you point out in your opening statement, you are committed to the rule of law and enforcing the laws of the land, but you are also a political appointee of the President. If you serve in another Cabinet position, certainly you are committed to implementing the President's agenda or the agenda of an administration, but as Attorney General, that is not an unequivocal commitment because there may be some things that the administration wants you to do that you cannot do consistent with the rule of law. Correct? General Barr. That is right, Senator. One of the reasons I ultimately decided that I would accept this position if it was offered to me was because I was--I feel that I am in a position to be independent. You know, over the years a lot of people have--some politicians have called me up saying, you know, ``I am thinking of going for the Attorney General position in this administration,'' and so forth. And I would say, ``You are crazy, because if you view yourself as having a political future down the road, do not take the job, because if you take this job, you have to be ready to make decisions and spend all your political capital and have no future because you have to do--you have to have that freedom of action.'' And I feel I am in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences in the sense that I do not-- I can truly be independent. Senator Cornyn. Mr. Barr, thinking back about the run-up to the 2016 election where the nominee of both political parties for President of the United States ended up being investigated by the FBI, can you think of any precedent in American history where that has occurred that you know of? General Barr. No, I cannot, Senator. Senator Cornyn. In thinking back to James Comey's press conference of July 7, 2016, where he took the step of talking about the evidence against Mrs. Clinton, talking about the legal standard that would apply as to whether she might or might not be indicted for committing a crime under the Espionage Act, have you ever seen a situation where an FBI Director would usurp the authority of the Department of Justice to make that charging decision and hold a press conference and talk about all of the derogatory information that the investigation had gleaned against a potential defendant and then say now we are not going to--no reasonable prosecutor would indict her? Have you ever seen anything like that happen before? General Barr. No, I have never seen that, and I thought it was a little bit--more than a little bit. It was weird at the time. But my initial reaction to it was, I think Attorney General Lynch had said something--you know, she was under pressure to recuse herself, I think, because of the so-called tarmac meeting. And I think she said something like she was going to defer to the FBI. So my initial reaction to that whole thing was, well, she must have agreed or it must have been the plan that he was going to make the decision and go out and announce his decision. Senator Cornyn. Under the normal rules, if the--if the Attorney General has a conflict of interest---- General Barr. It would go to the Deputy. Senator Cornyn. It would go to the Deputy. General Barr. Correct. Senator Cornyn. Not to the FBI Director to make that decision. Correct? General Barr. Right. So that is why I thought it was very strange, but I think later it became clearer, to the extent there was anything clear about it, that I do not think Attorney General Lynch had essentially delegated that authority to the Director. And I think Jim Comey, as I have said, is an extremely gifted man who has served the country with distinction in many roles, but I thought that to the extent he actually announced a decision was wrong. And the other thing is if you are not going to indict someone, then you do not stand up there and unload negative information about the person. That is not the way the Department of Justice does business. Senator Cornyn. I was shocked when Mr. Comey later wrote a letter saying that based on the discovery of Clinton emails on the Weiner laptop, that they were reopening the investigation that he had already announced closed. And then, finally, just days before the general election--November the 6th, 2016--said we did not find anything on the laptop that would change my conclusions based on the press conference of July the 6th. Did you likewise find that to be an extraordinary, I will use the word, ``bizarre,'' but certainly unprecedented event? General Barr. Yes, the whole sequence was very herky-jerky and bizarre. But at that time, I was a little of a contrarian in that I basically took the position that once he did what he did in July and said the thing was over and then found out it was not over, he--you know, he had no choice but to correct the record. So I said that he had no choice but to do what he did, but it sort of shows you what happens when you start disregarding the normal procedures and established practice is that you sort of dig yourself a deeper and deeper hole. Senator Cornyn. Why is it that the Department of Justice rules, which also apply to the FBI, make it clear that our chief law enforcement agencies in this country should not get tangled up in election politics? Are there policies in place that try to insulate the investigations and the decisions of the Department of Justice and FBI from getting involved in elections? General Barr. Yes, Senator, there are. Senator Cornyn. And why is that? General Barr. Well, obviously, because the incumbent party has their hands on the--among other reasons, they have their hands on the levers of the law enforcement apparatus of the country, and you do not want it used against the opposing political party. Senator Cornyn. And that is what happened when the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began in late July and continued on through, well, presumably, to Director Comey's firing and beyond? General Barr. Well, I am not in a position to, you know, make a judgment about it because I do not know what the predicate was for it. I think I said, you know, it is strange to have a counterintelligence investigation of a President. But I am not--you know, I just do not know what the predicate is. And if I am confirmed, I assume I will find out. Senator Cornyn. Rod Rosenstein's memo recommending the termination of James Comey as FBI Director was dated May the 9th, 2017. It is entitled, ``Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI.'' I take it you have read the memo, and do you agree with its conclusion? General Barr. I completely agree with Rod Rosenstein. And I thought the important point h"
