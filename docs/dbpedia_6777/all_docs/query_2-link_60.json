        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n* In the United States, elections offer a signal to the impact of populist ideologies that can polarize the citizenry. Politicians often validate these divides through the implementation of short-term fiscal and monetary policies. In the longer term, both theory and evidence suggest that institutions, geography, and culture define the ideological tensions within a society. The United States stands as a model in focusing on ideology simply because of its position as the paragon of capitalism, because of the legacy of the notion of \"manifest destiny\" in its struggle for land, and because of the immigrant mentality based on notions of liberty, free markets, and individual freedom. Historically, the electoral history of the United States provides evidence of divisions among politicians and various factions of the citizenry on issues of government centralization and regulatory power versus libertarian principles. * The role of third-party impact has been investigated using empirical models that estimate voting behavior of social groups in presidential elections. From a variety of social groups and ideologies within the United States, the so-called libertarian constituency is uniquely defined. Although other social groups adhere to the libertarian philosophy such as laissez-faire Republicans, pro-civil rights political parties, anti-war protestors, pro-education politicians, and environmentalists, the libertarian constituency is distinct because of its clear and consistent vision. Libertarianism is classified as an \"ism\" due to the fact that it places its tenets in a comprehensive and mutually exclusive manner. Therefore, economic studies that focus on voting suggest that the underlying characteristics of a given state's population have evolved in such a way as to validate libertarian ideology. The literature concludes that those states deemed as libertarian should have a higher percentage of support for the libertarian political movement.\n\n1.1. Background of Libertarianism in the US\n\nThe history of libertarianism in the United States can be dated back to the late 19th century. According to Rothbard, classical liberalism was significantly altered in the United States in the late 19th century by the appearance of a massive monopoly of land accessories to land in the hands of a relatively small group of people. As a result, tension arose between the elite class and the rest of society. Classical liberalism was then fragmented largely as progressivism and conservatism began offering other solutions. In the 1940s, Leonard E. Read founded the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) with the help of others who shared the belief that limited government solutions based on private property, voluntarism, individual social tolerance, and the rule of law could foster not only prosperity but also a peaceful planetary existence. A dozen years later, they began to organize politically, responding to an outburst of sentimental socialism imported by both major Mexican parties. During the Goldwater campaign of 1960 to 1964, however, many libertarians supported Barry Goldwater's Republican candidacy, and nearly everyone was involved in the New Right revolution, selling the GOP to a growing Wall Street/libertarian alliance. However, a general opposition towards the ways of the Republican Party increased. During the George Bush (senior)-era, for example, influences around Modern Age, Ayn Rand groups, and Liberty magazine also tended to become distinguished from the Bush regime. David Boaz and those around Reason magazine prepared the rudder's individualist revolution that became the libertarian-conservative difference. Since 1973, the Libertarian Party has made a presidential appearance in each U.S. presidential election with the aim of promoting the ideas of libertarianism.\n\nSeveral candidates sought the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination in 2008. While the Libertarian Party traditionally nominates a presidential ticket in conventions held in odd-numbered years, other sincere candidates seeking the 2008 nomination were George Phillies, the Libertarian Party candidate for Massachusetts governor in 2006, and New York entrepreneur Jason Sorens. Phillies, an academic and author, campaigned for a \"Libertarian Balance of Power\" involving a strong presidential ticket and utilizing Libertarian state legislators to influence the reapportionment process following the 2010 census. Jason Sorens co-founded the Free State Project, undertook a grassroots dues-based approach, restructured the New Hampshire Libertarian Party, and headed Loyola University of New Orleans's Federalist Society chapter. In January 2008, the Libertarian Party nominated longshot candidate Bob Barr, a former Republican U.S. Congressman from Georgia's Seventh District. Finally, Wayne Allen Root, the 2008 Libertarian Party's vice-presidential nominee, addressed the Party's candidate picture, relating that in 2007 Libertarian Party lawyers discussed among themselves the party's extreme negative public image. Opportunistically, he sought to refocus the campaign dialogue from the anti-war and anti-government budget to that of a positive, pragmatic approach. Interactive media served to make Ted Quinn better known within the Party. Prosecuting immigration offenses with a punishing vigor, Ron Paul and Barack Obama parallel comments, with the two aspiring to appear to perceive, address, and solve the USA's main problems. Root planned to begin papering the states with petitions for ballot positions for the Ticket while still running an Internet campaign. There are several Libertarian Party challenges: the Party is required to petition in all 48 states, it has limited funds, and write-in votes are not counted except in a very few states. The outcomes accomplished made Barr the candidate of most delegates before the 2008 Convention convened. Root communicated that response was the most overrated aspect of the horse/shoe thrower concept, and also invited the attendees to help him write his book's chapter on the 2008 campaign.\n\n2.1. Bob Barr\n\nBob Barr was the first candidate for President of the United States from the Libertarian Party, although there have been a number of candidates for Vice-President from the party. He is better known as a Republican member of the House of Representatives for twelve years, where he served as a \"drum-beater\" for the \"military-industrial complex\" and introduced the Defense of Marriage Act. He is a strong proponent of reduced government. A sitting President, George W. Bush, commented that, \"I don't know a lot about Bob Barr\". He was forced out of the Republican Party when he converted to being a \"federalist\", by which he meant that the states determine marriage laws and such decisions should not involve the federal government. In 2004, he made the crucial and controversial decision to appear as the lone Republican before the Libertarian Party National Convention to address the members' gathering in Atlanta and ask for the Presidential nomination. The activists were impressed and nominated him on the first ballot. However, the campaign was weak, to put it mildly. He worked hard for the party, gave a lot of speeches and strove to raise funds, but not much came in. There was nothing left for volunteers to do on the evening of November 2 but watch the election returns to see the size of their defeat. The only glimmer of light in his otherwise unimpressive campaign was that it got him an immediate new job, as a Vice-President of the Libertarian National Campaign Committee.\n\n2.2. Wayne Allyn Root\n\nWayne Allyn Root, more commonly referred to as \"Root\" during interviews and appearances, is vying for the Libertarian Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 election. Promoting a Libertarian re-brand via a message that meshes fiscal restraint and government responsibility with a more positive, happy, successful message and image regarding capitalism and individual responsibility, he believes that his political persuasion includes individuals from both major parties and can appeal to both constituencies, especially the entrepreneurial, financially successful, and white-collar \"Silent Majority\" that has generally left the major party fold. The author once again assesses how this somewhat unique candidacy might come to impact the presumptive major party candidates and why, of late, coverage was often outsourced to international media. Wayne Allyn Root, now known as Root during his interviews, has a proud new image—although, if the many different photos on his website accompanying his articles and speeches are any indicator, he is not sure yet exactly what the new image should be—combining almost the complete surnames of two other past Libertarian Party presidential aspirants, an approach to public policy that also bears their imprint, and a personality that has to some extent also become a synthesis of the two individuals he is emulating. The physical appearance of Root is, of course, much more like 2004 Gary Nolan (although Root is a bit stockier), as is his brusque, no-nonsense, \"take no prisoners\" style, although Root will perhaps more likely dish out a pointed libertarian conservative economic message where Nolan preferred to stay focused on individual property rights and other more specific policy issues, rather than delivering the entire libertarian conservative economic and anti-statist package. Wayne Root is obviously not as much as Nolan a one-issue activist.\n\n3. Libertarian Party Platform and Policies\n\nMost citizens of the United States have been exposed to the \"Americans for Democratic Action\" ratings, which rate voting records of elected officials according to the organization's policies and goals. Charts of these ratings have been published and are readily available. People well within what are considered \"middle of the road\" have been rated by the ADA as favoring a \"liberal\" line according to the ratings. Without here dealing with the pros and cons of the heavily loaded term \"liberal\", we must wonder how far conventional wisdom about what is liberal will lead us. Should the term \"liberal\" as used in our political discourses be separated from its European meanings minus the idea of class struggle and people's democracy and thus be available for a different meaning? How far can it be stretched? This paper will not definitively answer such questions but it will begin to probe for the limits of the term. It does so by comparing the Libertarian Party platform and selected congressional voting records with the American for Democratic Action ratings.\n\n4. Influence and Impact of Libertarians in the 2008 Election\n\nThis final section underscores that despite a commitment to limited government, the presence of a multi-candidate Libertarian Presidential field with experienced candidates such as Wayne Allyn Root firmly committed to building the Party as a permanent presence in American politics, set the stage and laid the foundations for such long-term libertarian political viability. Finally, in this section, the Libertarian impact on US Presidential politics is assessed. While it is clear that libertarians were not responsible for the outcome of the 2008 US Presidential election, the 2008 election was influential in denying both major party candidates an absolute majority of the popular vote, gave a 54-vote Obama edge in the Electoral College that forced the Republicans what looks to be a long and protracted contest against President Barack Obama, and pushed both major party formerly big government candidates shoulder by shoulder toward fiscal conservatism by embracing sound money and fiscal conservation. Without Ross Perot in 1992, Bill Clinton or George H. W. Bush would not have been elected. The presence of Bob Barr and Wayne Allyn Root in the 2008 Election focused many new individuals upon the struggles to preserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The stampede by the surviving libertarian Republicans helped increase the public standing of both Bob Barr and Wayne Allyn Root.\n\n4.1. Voter Demographics and Support\n\nDemographic data of the libertarian vote at the national, regional, state, and local levels is entirely absent from the literature. Regionally, libertarian support has been dramatically skewed in favor of fewer regions. Table 4.1 provides a breakdown of the percentage of total states that granted automatic ballots, plus the percentage of states with more than 5% or more than 10% of the total states providing automatic ballots. Of the eight regions analyzed, only the West region contained a majority percentage of automatic states due to Libertarian Party status as a recognized major party in California. Similarly, the West was the only region to have a single state with more than 5% or 10% of the total states. Comparatively, the West region was also the most consistently allocated and easily identified region in the present study. Unfortunately, such a small number of states permitted per region required that the West enjoy less consistent attention than the northeast and midwestern groups. Interestingly, while the Midwest does contain a larger population and voter base than either the south or the northeast, the region enjoyed far smaller voter tallies. This paradox is interesting. In part, the poor voter performance may be due to a limited and minority accessible ballot states; however, the more conservative roots and greater rural dwellings of potential libertarians suggest regionally higher voter identification.\n\n5. Conclusion and Future Implications\n\nThe emergence of the Libertarian Party in the 2008 presidential election is not likely to lead to a libertarian candidate's capturing the presidency any time soon. However, there is hope that the party is here to stay as a third force and an alternative to the major party duopoly. It has to convince itself that gaining a large vote at the presidential election should not be its primary target. Rather, it must work to build a visible and significant presence in all levels of government throughout the country. In doing this, it should take advantage of many of the issues currently faced but largely ignored by the major parties. Liberties have to be preserved before economic growth is given a chance to emerge. The major threat to the party is not the quality of the people involved within the party, but their selection and election by their own members. The party can quickly become weighted down with social fissionists who see the party as an opportunity to inflict their fundamental beliefs on other members in the same way as they feel the major parties impose their wills on them. There will have to be some form of party leadership to ensure a workable, coherent, and electable set of beliefs is enunciated to the electorate. Freedom, liberty, and the protection of individual rights are the first priority, but having the chance to put them into practice by gaining an acceptable proportion of election wins is the next priority. Societies have continually changed since the foundation of the US, and this will continue well into the future. Hence, the core beliefs of the Libertarian Party have to be flexible enough to accept and embrace most of these societal changes."
