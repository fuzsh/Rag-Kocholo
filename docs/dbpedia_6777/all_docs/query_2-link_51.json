        "text": "Published\n\n15 December 2020\n\nDonald Trump's old catchphrase was \"you're fired\" - and while he has been president, his senior team has had a very high turnover.\n\nHere is a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with the most recent.\n\nWilliam Barr, US Attorney General - 14 December 2020\n\nMr Barr, 70, came out of semi-retirement in 2019 to replace Jeff Sessions for the cabinet role. During his lengthy legal career, he also served as attorney general under President George HW Bush in the early 1990s.\n\nDemocratic critics of Mr Barr accused him of shielding his ex-boss from justice.\n\nBut despite his support for the president, Trump and many of his supporters turned on Mr Barr over his unwillingness to support the president's election lawsuits.\n\nHis resignation comes into effect on 23 December - less than a month before his term is due to end, when President Trump leaves office.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nTensions flared between the two after Mr Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in November's election.\n\nHe was also criticised by the president for not publicly disclosing during the race that his justice department was investigating Joe Biden's son Hunter.\n\nMr Barr's resignation letter to President Trump began by saying he \"appreciated the opportunity to update\" the president on the Department of Justice's review of voter fraud allegations in the recent election and \"how these allegations will continue to be pursued\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, ten months\n\nChris Krebs, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency - 17 November 2020\n\nA former Microsoft executive, Mr Krebs had led the agency since its inception in 2018 in the aftermath of alleged Russian interference in 2016's presidential elections.\n\nAs director he was responsible for improving cybersecurity across all levels of government, and safeguarding the security of the 2020 elections.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Krebs had been praised by both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the latest election.\n\nBut he reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over a Cisa website called Rumor Control, external, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself.\n\nHours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Mr Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Mr Biden.\n\nPresident Trump said he \"terminated\" Mr Krebs for \"highly inaccurate\" remarks on voting integrity.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTwo years.\n\nMark Esper, Defence Secretary - 9 November 2020\n\nMark Esper was appointed in 2019. He replaced an acting secretary of defence who was standing in after James Mattis left in 2018 over differences with Donald Trump on Syria, among other things.\n\nMr Esper's relations with the president turned out to be equally rocky, towards the end at least.\n\nHe was \"terminated\" in the post in a tweet from Mr Trump, who announced the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christopher Miller, was replacing him.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nThe secretary disagreed with the president on a number of issues, most publicly on the use of active-duty military forces to quell street protests.\n\nMr Esper was also far more conciliatory towards Nato than Mr Trump.\n\nMr Esper had reportedly been preparing to resign - or to be sacked - since the president's election defeat.\n\nTime in post?\n\nJust short of 17 months.\n\nKellyanne Conway, senior counsellor to the president - 23 August 2020\n\nMrs Conway served as Donald Trump's campaign manager in the three months up to his election in November 2016.\n\nShe then became senior counsellor at the White House, and one of the president's closest advisers.\n\nShe became noted for her colourful and high-profile defences of the president, and her sparring with journalists.\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nShe said she wanted to spend more time focusing on her children.\n\nHer decision to step down came hours after one of her daughters, Claudia, tweeted that her mother's job had \"ruined [her] life\" - a message that later went viral.\n\nAmong Mrs Conway's many colourful lines, one of the most famous was \"alternative facts\", the phrase she used to describe then White House press secretary Sean Spicer's highly questioned figures about the number of people attending Mr Trump's inauguration.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFour years, first as election campaign manager, then senior adviser.\n\nBrad Parscale, Campaign Manager - 15 July 2020\n\nMr Parscale served as digital media director for Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The 44-year-old was promoted to campaign manager for the president's 2020 re-election bid in February 2018.\n\nHe has been a warm-up act for Mr Trump at rallies.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Parscale has reportedly been blamed by the US president's inner circle for a poorly attended rally in Oklahoma in June.\n\nHe boasted that more than one million people registered to attend the event, but the local fire department said fewer than 6,200 showed up.\n\nMr Parscale blamed a blocked security gate, protesters and the media for the disappointing turnout.\n\nMr Trump announced on social media that Mr Parscale was being replaced by Bill Stepien, a former aide to ex-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n\nThe president did not offer any reasons for the decision and praised Mr Parscale's work on digital and data strategies.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTwo years, five months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Parscale is still working as a senior advisor to the Trump campaign.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Acting White House Chief of Staff - 6 March 2020\n\nMr Mulvaney assumed the role of acting White House chief of staff in January 2019. He previously served as director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDespite his key White House roles, he was never part of the Trump inner circle.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMy Mulvaney's departure had been long rumoured and followed some high-profile slip-ups.\n\nMost notably, he was perceived to have implicated the president in the impeachment inquiry in an off-the-cuff remark at the White House podium, in which he shrugged off criticism over an alleged corrupt deal with Ukraine by saying: \"We do that all the time.\"\n\nMr Trump was reportedly outraged by the gaffe.\n\nIn a written statement, Mr Mulvaney said: \"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\"\n\nMr Trump announced on 6 March that Mr Mulvaney was being replaced by North Carolina lawmaker Mark Meadows.\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, two months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Mulvaney is now working as US special envoy to Northern Ireland.\n\nGordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU - 7 February 2020\n\nMr Sondland was appointed as US ambassador to the European Union in June 2018. Before entering into politics, he was best known as a multi-millionaire hotelier.\n\nHe originally backed a Trump rival in the 2016 presidential race, but when Mr Trump was elected, he donated $1m (Â£781,000) to his inaugural committee.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Sondland was fired after testifying against Mr Trump in the impeachment proceedings. In his testimony, he accused the president of seeking a \"quid pro quo\" with Ukraine.\n\nOn 7 February, Mr Sondland said he had been advised that the president intended \"to recall [him] effective immediately\".\n\nIn a statement issued by his lawyer, he said: \"I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the US mission to the European Union.\"\n\nTime in post?\n\nJust over one and a half years.\n\nAlexander Vindman, National Security Aide - 7 February 2020\n\nLt Col Alexander Vindman is a decorated Iraq war veteran who served as the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council.\n\nHe was born in Ukraine, then a Soviet republic, and moved to the US with his family when he and his twin brother, Yevgeny, were aged three.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nLt Col Vindman's lawyer said he was fired after testifying as a witness in Mr Trump's impeachment case.\n\nHis lawyer said he was escorted from the White House, while his twin brother, a senior lawyer for the National Security Council, was also sent back to the Department of the Army.\n\nDuring the impeachment proceedings, Lt Col Vindman described a phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart as \"improper\" and said it had left him in \"shock\".\n\nMr Trump defended the decision to fire him, describing the Ukraine expert as \"very insubordinate\".\n\nHe said Lt Col Vindman had incorrectly reported the contents of a \"perfect\" phone call.\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, seven months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nLt Col Vindman announced in July that he had retired from the military after 21 years of service because his future would be \"forever limited\".\n\nHis lawyer said the 45-year-old had been the victim of a \"campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation\" by the president.\n\nRichard Spencer, Navy Secretary - 24 November 2019\n\nMr Spencer, a former Marines pilot-turned-investment banker, was sworn in as the 76th secretary of the US Navy in August 2017.\n\nDuring his time in the post, he also performed stints as acting secretary of defence and deputy secretary of defence.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nUS Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he asked Mr Spencer to resign over \"his lack of candour\" regarding the case of a Navy Seal convicted of posing with a corpse while serving in Iraq.\n\nThe case of Edward Gallagher has sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials.\n\nThe president reinstated Chief Petty Officer Gallagher's rank after he was demoted following his conviction, and later hit out at plans to hold a disciplinary review that could have resulted in him being stripped of his Seals membership.\n\nIn a statement announcing the firing, Mr Esper alleged Mr Spencer had proposed a deal with the White House behind his back to resolve the case.\n\nMr Trump, however, said he was not happy with \"cost overruns\" and how Gallagher's trial was run, and suggested this was why Mr Spencer was fired.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Spencer said it was apparent that he and Mr Trump did not have the same view of \"good order and discipline\".\n\n\"I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took,\" he wrote.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTwo years, three months.\n\nKevin McAleenan, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security - 13 November 2019\n\nBefore joining the cabinet, Mr McAleenan worked as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nHe oversaw the president's tough policies aimed at curbing immigration across the Mexican border.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nIn a tweet, President Donald Trump said Mr McAleenan wanted to \"spend more time with his family and go into the private sector.\"\n\nDuring his tenure, analysts described a turbulent relationship between the two.\n\nMr McAleenan has also criticised the \"uncomfortable\" tone of debate about immigration in America.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix months\n\nJohn Bolton, National Security Adviser - 10 September 2019\n\nMr Bolton assumed the post in April 2018, becoming Mr Trump's third national security adviser after Michael Flynn and HR McMaster. At that time, the president's decision to appoint Mr Bolton came as a surprise.\n\nHe remained an unapologetic cheerleader of the 2003 Iraq war, which the US president himself once lambasted as \"a big mistake\". Mr Bolton was praised, however, by conservative admirers as a straight-talking foreign policy \"hawk\".\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Trump announced Mr Bolton's departure in a tweet, writing that his national security adviser's services were \"no longer needed\". But Mr Bolton quickly fired back, writing on Twitter that he had actually offered his resignation, but Mr Trump had told him \"let's talk about it tomorrow\".\n\nMr Bolton's exit follows an argument with Mr Trump over the administration's peace talks with the Taliban.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters: \"[The president] didn't like a lot of his policies, they disagree.\"\n\nAccording to White House sources, the National Security Council - which advises the president - had become a separate entity during Mr Bolton's tenure.\n\nA former senior Trump administration official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that Mr Bolton did not attend meetings, and followed his own initiatives.\n\n\"He's running his own show,\" said the official.\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, four months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nJust a few days after his departure, Mr Bolton resumed his former job as the head of two political action committees: the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC.\n\nSo-called PACs promote the views of their members on selected issues, and have become an important tool for funnelling large funds into the political process and influencing elections.\n\nMr Bolton released a book in June 2020 - The Room Where it Happened -about his time in the White House. In it, he paints a picture of a president ignorant of basic geopolitical facts and whose decisions were frequently driven by a desire for re-election.\n\nThe White House had sought to block the book's release citing national security concerns.\n\nRead more: Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's Donald Trump book\n\nDan Coats, Director of National Intelligence - 15 August 2019\n\nAs director of national intelligence, Mr Coats oversaw all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA. His office also had the authority to receive whistleblower complaints and decide if they should be referred to Congress.\n\nBut Mr Coats' assessments were routinely contradicted by President Trump, who has been critical of the US intelligence community. In January, the president called his intelligence chiefs passive and naive in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran.\n\nOn 28 July, President Donald Trump tweeted Mr Coats would step down in mid-August and Texas congressman John Ratcliffe would be nominated to replace him.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nIn his resignation letter to the president, Mr Coats said America's intelligence community had become \"stronger than ever\" during his two-and-half-year tenure.\n\n\"As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Coats, a former senator and diplomat, said in February the president had asked him to stay in the post, yet their differences on foreign policy appeared irreconcilable at times.\n\nBut the timing of his removal has been questioned by critics. The announcement came three days after a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which was the subject of a whistleblower complaint. The White House released a rough transcript of the call which shows Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic frontrunner for the 2020 presidential elections.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTwo and a half years.\n\nAlexander Acosta, Labour Secretary - 19 July 2019\n\nMr Acosta, a former federal prosecutor, was sworn in as Secretary in April 2017 - the first Hispanic appointee to the Cabinet. He was chosen for the role after Mr Trump's first choice, fast-food billionaire Andrew Puzder, withdrew.\n\nDuring his tenure, Mr Acosta oversaw initiatives to expand on promote workplace apprenticeships. But he was criticised for proposing massive cuts to the International Labor Affairs Bureau, a section of the department that combats human trafficking, child labour and forced labour.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Acosta had been defending his role in a 2008 plea deal that saw a light sentence for financier Jeffrey Epstein after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges. Epstein was charged in July with new sex trafficking charges related to that case.\n\nTop Democrats had called on Mr Acosta to resign for engaging in \"an unconscionable agreement\" with Epstein.\n\nMr Acosta said he negotiated the deal to ensure Epstein did not walk free, and that he was happy about the new case moving forward.\n\nWhile announcing his resignation, the former US attorney from Florida said he felt the \"right thing was to step aside\" so his past controversies would not overshadow the administration's accomplishments.\n\nMr Trump, who stood next to Mr Acosta while he spoke to reporters, noted: \"This was him, not me.\" He said Mr Acosta was \"a great Labour Secretary\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nJust over two years.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary - 1 July 2019\n\nMs Sanders started out as deputy press secretary before replacing Sean Spicer in the top post - the third woman to ever hold the White House role.\n\nWhile Press Secretary, she was accused of lying to journalists and frequently criticised the media for spreading \"fake news\" about the Trump administration.\n\nPress briefings also became increasingly rare during her tenure as Mr Trump took charge of his own messaging. Mrs Sanders hosted fewer news conferences than any of the preceding 13 press secretaries, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nExact reasons are unclear, but President Trump announced her resignation on Twitter and lauded her as a \"warrior\".\n\nDuring her resignation speech, Ms Sanders said her role had been \"the honour of a lifetime\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nNearly two years.\n\nWhat is she doing now?\n\nMs Sanders is a regular contributor on television news channel Fox News, and is active among conservative groups.\n\nRod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General - 11 May 2019\n\nRod Rosenstein eventually submitted a resignation letter, effective from 11 May, after months of rumours about his departure.\n\nIt came shortly after the release of the report into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election - an investigation he oversaw.\n\nReports say he specially timed his departure to allow for Robert Mueller's probe to wind down first.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nHis relationship with the president was always publicly fraught - with the lawyer frequently coming under fire on Mr Trump's Twitter feed.\n\nThere were even reports in 2018 that Mr Rosenstein at one point planned to secretly record the president in order to justify his removal under the 25th amendment of the US constitution.\n\nDespite this, Mr Rosenstein's resignation letter paid tribute to Mr Trump.\n\nIn it, Rosenstein said he was \"grateful\" for the opportunity to serve under him and even signed it off borrowing his campaign slogan of \"America first\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nJust over two years from his confirmation.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen, Homeland Security Secretary - 10 April 2019\n\nKirstjen Nielsen became Homeland Security Secretary in December 2017.\n\nHer sprawling department, responsible for domestic security, covers everything from borders to responding to national emergencies.\n\nShe faced criticism for enforcing some of the most controversial elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, such as the separation of children from their migrant parents at the Mexican border.\n\nIn a resignation letter she said it was the \"right time for me to step aside\".\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nThere have been tensions between her and the president for months, who blamed her for a rise in migrants at the Mexican border.\n\nDays earlier President Trump withdrew his nominee to lead another key department dealing with immigration, saying he wanted to go in a \"tougher direction\". It is widely thought he wants someone \"tougher\" at Homeland Security too.\n\nTime in post?\n\n16 months.\n\nWhat is she doing now?\n\nSix months after her resignation, the White House announced that she would be rejoining the Homeland Security department as a member of its National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\n\nIn June 2020, the Australian government announced that it had hired her to help prepare a cyber security strategy.\n\nBrock Long, Administrator of Fema - 8 March 2019\n\nBrock Long was appointed administrator of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency by President Trump in April 2017 and confirmed by the Senate two months later.\n\nFema is responsible for co-ordinating the response to disasters and in his tenure he oversaw 220 of them. He was quickly battered by two hurricanes. Harvey hit Texas with catastrophic effect in August 2017, while Maria a month later devastated Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US.\n\nHe was one of those who bore heavy criticism for the response afforded to Puerto Rico.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Long gave no explicit reason for his departure, saying in a statement that it was \"time to go home to my family\".\n\nDuring his tenure, he was investigated for using government vehicles to commute from his home in North Carolina to Washington. He was later ordered to pay back the government $151,000 (Â£117,000) for the cost of several private journeys he claimed on expenses.\n\nTime in post?\n\n21 months from confirmation.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Long is executive chairman of Hagerty Consulting, an emergency management consultancy firm where he worked before joining FEMA.\n\nRyan Zinke, Interior Secretary - 2 January 2019\n\nA former Navy SEAL, Ryan Zinke was picked to lead the agency that oversees federal land, including national parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone.\n\nHe served as a congressman in his home state of Montana before the cabinet appointment.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nPresident Trump tweeted that Mr Zinke would be leaving the administration at the end of 2018. He did not offer any further details and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired.\n\n\"Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Zinke was under a number of investigations for his conduct in office. They include a land deal in Montana, external involving Mr Zinke and the chairman of oilfield services Halliburton.\n\nTime in post?\n\nAlmost two years.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nIn January 2019, Mr Zinke became managing director of Artillery One, an investment firm specialising in the technology and energy sectors.\n\nWhile details of the role are unclear, the company said Mr Zinke would help to \"pursue investing and development opportunities globally\".\n\nJohn Kelly, Chief of Staff - 2 January 2019\n\nThe retired Marine general was initially nominated to oversee Homeland Security before Mr Trump promoted him to chief of staff in July 2017, replacing Reince Priebus.\n\nHowever, on 8 December Mr Trump announced that Gen Kelly would leave his post by the end of the year.\n\nKey Trump aide John Kelly to leave job\n\nWhy is he leaving?\n\nBy December 2018 his relationship with the president was said to have deteriorated, with some reports saying the pair were no longer on speaking terms.\n\nEarlier in the year Mr Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an \"idiot\" after the quote was included in a book by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward.\n\nTime in post?\n\nAbout one year, five months. (He was previously Homeland Security secretary from January to July 2017.)\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Kelly serves on the board of Caliburn International, a professional services firm where we worked . The professional services company has several government contracts, including one to operate a migrant detention centre in Florida.\n\nJim Mattis, Defence Secretary - 1 January 2019\n\nA distinguished former Marine Corps general, Gen Mattis served in the Gulf War, the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War.\n\nBefore his retirement in 2013 he served as head of US Central Command, and went on to several private sector roles before being tapped to join President Trump's cabinet.\n\nHe positioned himself as one of the cooler heads throughout the president's term, and was referenced by Democrats and Republicans alike as a \"grown-up\" in the room - a far cry from his \"Mad Dog Mattis\" nickname.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nThe move came just one day after the president controversially announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria.\n\nAlthough not referring directly to that, in his resignation letter Gen Mattis said the president had the right to have a defence secretary \"whose views are better aligned\" with his.\n\nThe two had diverging public views on a number of subjects, including Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,\" Gen Mattis wrote.\n\nPresident Trump was so angered with the letter than he accelerated Gen Mattis' departure date and said he was \"essentially fired.\"\n\nTime in post?\n\nJust under two years.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nGen Mattis has returned to his former role as Fellow at the Hoover Institution - a think tank based at Stanford University.\n\nAs a Fellow, the institute said he plans \"to focus his research and writing on domestic and international security policy.\"\n\nIn June 2020, he denounced Mr Trump's use of military force to quell anti-racism protests near the White House, and accused his former boss of setting up a \"false conflict\" between the military and civilian society.\n\nNikki Haley, Ambassador to the UN - 31 December 2018\n\nThe former governor of South Carolina was the first non-white woman to be appointed to Mr Trump's cabinet, and the first female, minority governor of her state.\n\nShe had limited foreign policy experience prior to her role as US envoy and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump during his campaign.\n\nAs ambassador, she affirmed sanctions on Russia would continue, and that the US military could be deployed in the response to North Korean missile tests. But she frequently clashed with the president over several foreign policy issues, including a proposed ban on immigration to the US from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nTrump names former critic as UN envoy\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nIn a news conference with Mr Trump, Mrs Haley announced she was stepping aside after a \"rough\" eight years as governor and envoy.\n\nShe will be leaving her post at the end of 2018, but said she did not yet know what her next steps would be.\n\nMrs Haley said she wanted to make sure Mr Trump's administration \"has the strongest person to fight\" for the US at the UN.\n\nWhile accepting her resignation, Mr Trump thanked her and said she did a \"terrific job\", making the role \"very glamorous\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, eleven months\n\nWhat is she doing now?\n\nIn April 2019, Ms Haley began sitting on the board of directors at Boeing. Critics suggested that she received the appointment as a reward for the tax breaks and subsidies which Boeing received while she was governor.\n\nThe following March, the company announced that she had resigned because she opposed their move to seek financial support from the government amid the coronavirus crisis.\n\nJeff Sessions, Attorney General - 7 November 2018\n\nThe Alabama Republican was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, in early 2016.\n\nDuring the campaign, he became one of Mr Trump's closest national security advisers and, in government, was a supporter of the president's policies on immigration and law enforcement.\n\nWhy was he fired?\n\nMr Sessions became a frequent target of the president's ire as soon as he stepped aside, in March 2017, from the investigation over alleged Russian collusion with Mr Trump's campaign. The recusal allowed his deputy Rod Rosenstein to oversee the inquiry, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAt various times, Mr Trump publicly belittled Mr Sessions as \"beleaguered\", \"VERY weak\", and \"DISGRACEFUL\". But Mr Sessions reacted to most of the insults in silence.\n\nUS media reported that Gen Kelly had called Mr Sessions to say the president wanted him to step down. Mr Trump did not speak to Mr Sessions himself, and announced the departure on Twitter.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Sessions made clear the decision was not his own, saying: \"Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation.\"\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, nine months\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nIn July 2020, Mr Sessions lost the Republican nomination for his old Senate seat in Alabama, losing to a candidate backed by Mr Trump.\n\nMr Trump tweeted his delight at the result.\n\nConceding defeat, Mr Sessions said he still had no regrets over recusing himself from the investigations into allegations of Russian interference.\n\nScott Pruitt, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency - 6 July 2018\n\nThe lawyer served as the attorney general of Oklahoma from 2011 - 2017.\n\nHe had sued the EPA, the agency which he presided over, a number of times in his role as the state's attorney general.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nDonald Trump announced that Mr Pruitt had resigned due to \"unrelenting attacks\" on himself and his family.\n\nSince taking office, Mr Pruitt was mired in series of scandals concerning his spending habits and alleged misuse of office, and is the subject of at least a dozen investigations into his conduct.\n\nHe angered many liberals and environmentalists by severely curtailing the agency's activities and repealing many measures designed to protect the environment.\n\nThe long list of Scott Pruitt controversies\n\nWhile accepting Mr Pruitt's resignation, Mr Trump tweeted that he had done \"an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year, four months\n\nHR McMaster, National Security Adviser - 9 April 2018\n\nA lieutenant general with the US Army, HR McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive.\n\nHe replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.\n\nTime magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he \"might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker\".\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Trump reportedly disliked his \"gruff and condescending\" manner and the pair reportedly disagreed on the administration's policy towards Russia, North Korea and Iran.\n\nGen Kelly, White House chief of staff at the time, also had little positive to say about him.\n\nTime in post?\n\nThirteen months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nGen McMaster works as a fellow and lecturer at Stanford University. He is also a board member of Spirit of America, a charity which \"improves the safety and success\" of US military personnel and diplomats deployed abroad.\n\nIn 2020, he is set to release a memoir called \"Battlegrounds\".\n\nGary Cohn, Chief Economic Adviser - 2 April 2018\n\nThe former president of the Goldman Sachs bank was appointed as head of the National Economic Council as Mr Trump took office, so becoming the president's top economic adviser.\n\nIn his time at the White House, he helped push through sweeping reforms on taxes, one of the most significant policy achievements of the administration.\n\nBut the two were not reported to be close, and rumours of Mr Cohn's departure continued to swirl.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nA staunch globalist, Mr Cohn had reportedly vowed to quit if Mr Trump pressed ahead with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to the US.\n\nAccording to US media, Mr Cohn initially planned to resign after Mr Trump blamed \"both sides\" for violence at a deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFourteen months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nSince leaving, Mr Cohn has become a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nRex Tillerson, Secretary of State - 31 March 2018\n\nMr Tillerson was the first Secretary of State to be appointed under the Trump administration.\n\nA former oil executive, Mr Tillerson pushed for an end to sanctions on Russia and for the resumption of peace talks with North Korea.\n\nBut his tenure was reportedly mired by clashes with the president over policy, and by the resignation of several high-ranking career diplomats.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Trump said his differences with Mr Tillerson came down to personal \"chemistry\".\n\nIndications of the pair's deteriorating relationship first surfaced after reports that Mr Tillerson had called the president a \"moron\". The comment was allegedly made after Mr Trump had pushed for a tenfold increase in America's nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn a subsequent media appearance, the president challenged Mr Tillerson to \"compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win\".\n\nPresident Trump announced his departure in a tweet, though Mr Tillerson's spokesperson said he had not told about it beforehand.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFourteen months.\n\nHope Hicks, White House Communications Director - 29 March 2018\n\nMs Hicks served as Mr Trump's press secretary and handled media requests during his campaign.\n\nShe became his fourth director of strategic communications for the Trump White House after Anthony Scaramucci was fired after just 10 days in the job.\n\nThe fashion model-turned-spokeswoman previously worked as a publicist for Ivanka Trump's fashion label before entering politics with Mr Trump's bid for the White House.\n\nWhy did she leave?\n\nHer resignation came a day after she testified to a congressional panel investigating Russian influence on the 2016 election, telling them she had occasionally told \"white lies\" for her boss.\n\nHer departure came only weeks after another top aide to Mr Trump, Rob Porter - with whom Ms Hicks was reported to have been in a relationship - quit amid allegations by two ex-wives of abuse.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix years in the Trump Organization, and three years with Mr Trump during his campaign and presidency.\n\nWhat is she doing now?\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Ms Hicks became chief communications officer at Fox Corporation, an American broadcasting firm.\n\nIn February 2020, she returned to the White House, taking on the role of counsellor to the president and reporting to Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nDavid Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018\n\nA doctor and former healthcare executive, Mr Shulkin had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama.\n\nPresident Trump had hailed him as \"fantastic\" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nMr Shulkin had come under fire for alleged improper behaviour by department staff on a trip to Europe in 2017, including his own acceptance of tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. He denied wrongdoing but agreed to reimburse the government for his wife's air fare for the trip.\n\nMr Shulkin won praise from veterans' groups, but his lack of action on privatising the Veterans Health Administration had angered conservatives.\n\nIn parting, he condemned the \"toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive\" environment in Washington.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFourteen months\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nIn October 2019, the former VA Secretary published a book tracing his 13 months in the Trump administration.\n\nRob Porter, White House Staff Secretary - 7 February 2018\n\nA former political aide, Mr Porter was described as Mr Trump's \"right-hand man\" during his tenure.\n\nAs Staff Secretary he helped to manage the flow of paperwork reaching Trump, from policy memos to speeches and news briefing documents. He was also responsible for circulating documents among senior staff for comment.\n\nWhy did he quit?\n\nMr Porter resigned soon after two of his ex-wives publicly accused him of physical and emotional abuse. One, Colbie Holderness, supplied a photo of herself with a black eye to the media.\n\nHe denies all the accusations of abuse.\n\nThe Daily Mail, which broke the story, reported that Mr Porter did not receive security clearance for his White House job after the FBI interviewed his ex-wives during background checks.\n\nAfter his resignation, questions quickly arose over how early the president's chief of staff, Gen Kelly, had been made aware of the accusations by the FBI, and if they had played a role in his diminished security clearance.\n\nTime in post?\n\nOne year.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nSince leaving, the Daily Mail reported that Mr Porter was secretly hired to help with President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the campaign's chief operating officer, Michael Glassner, denied the accusation.\n\nAndrew McCabe, FBI Deputy Director - 29 January 2018\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nHe was fired by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators.\n\nMr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nBefore his departure, he had been under an internal investigation into the FBI's handling of two key inquiries during the 2016 presidential campaign: the revelations that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server while secretary of state; and suspicions that Russia was interfering to help Mr Trump win the presidency.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTwo years as FBI deputy director, including a year under Mr Trump's administration.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr McCabe has retired from the FBI and is a contributor to news broadcaster CNN.\n\nTom Price, Health Secretary - 29 September 2017\n\nThe former Georgia congressman was a long-standing opponent of the Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare.\n\nMr Price was confirmed by the Senate along party lines, amid allegations of insider trading while he worked on healthcare laws - which he denied.\n\nAs health secretary, Mr Price was involved in President Trump's repeated failures to push through bills repealing Obamacare.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nAn analysis of transport spending by Politico discovered that Mr Price had, between May and late September, spent more than $1m on flights.\n\nSome $500,000 of that was on military flights approved by the White House, but private charter flights made up at least $400,000 where commercial flights were available. Mr Trump said he was \"not happy\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nAlmost eight months.\n\nSteve Bannon, Chief Strategist - 18 August 2017\n\nSteve Bannon joined the Trump campaign after leading the right-wing Breitbart News website, which rose to prominence through its attacks on mainstream Republicans, as well as those on the left.\n\nThe website helped to elevate the so-called \"Alt-right\", which critics label a white supremacist group.\n\nLike other aides to Mr Trump, he made his fortune as an investment banker, but later turned to financing film and television programmes such as the popular 90s sitcom Seinfeld.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nSome of Mr Trump's most influential advisers, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been pushing for his departure for months.\n\nHis firing came amid a public backlash to Mr Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which an anti-racist protester was killed by a 20-year-old man with Nazi sympathies.\n\nTime in post?\n\nFired one year after being named campaign chief.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nAfter his departure, Mr Bannon briefly rejoined Breitbart News as executive chairman.\n\nHe drew ire from President Trump after the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury, which detailed several comments made by Mr Bannon that were critical of the administration.\n\nMr Bannon remains active within politics and has served as an informal advisor to right-wing parties across Europe, Brazil and Israel. As part of this work he co-founded of The Movement, a Brussels-based organisation helping to promote the election of right-wing populist parties across Europe.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, Communications Director - 31 July 2017\n\nThe brash, Wall Street bigwig has known President Trump for years, and defended him in TV interviews.\n\nWhile in the job, he appeared to accuse then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him.\n\nMr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nAlthough he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's outbursts may have cost him any post alongside Gen Kelly, who was replacing Reince Priebus as chief of staff.\n\nMr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Gen Kelly was sworn-in.\n\nTime in post?\n\nTen days (although his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus 15 days.)\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Scaramucci is a contributor to several media outlets and has founded his own media group, The Scaramucci Post. He is also a trustee of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Foundation.\n\nMr Scaramucci has been a vocal critic of President Trump since his departure, and has been the target of several visceral tweets by the commander-in-chief.\n\nReince Priebus, Chief of Staff - 31 July 2017\n\nThe former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority.\n\nHe grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played key roles.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nPresident Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak.\n\nThe announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix months.\n\nSean Spicer, Press Secretary - 21 July 2017\n\nMr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration.\n\nOver the course of his time behind the podium he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live.\n\nWhy did he leave?\n\nUnlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president.\n\nHe stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen\".\n\nTime in post?\n\nSix months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Spicer is a public affairs officer with the US Navy and was appointed by President to serve on the US Naval Academy's Board of Visitors.\n\nHe has also written a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President in which he referred to Trump as \"unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow\".\n\nIn a surprise public appearance, he entered as a contestant on popular TV show Dancing with the Stars in 2019.\n\nJames Comey, FBI director - 9 May 2017\n\nMr Comey played a dramatic and controversial part in the closing stages of the election when he announced, a week before the vote, that the FBI had reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.\n\nHe was criticised first by Democrats for the timing, then by Republicans when he said a week later that no charges would be brought.\n\nThe president grew less appreciative of him as the FBI director led an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nThe Trump administration first claimed Mr Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation rendered him no longer able to credibly lead the bureau and that Mr Trump had acted on the deputy attorney general's recommendation.\n\nHowever Mr Trump soon contradicted this, calling him a \"showboat\" in a TV interview and saying he was thinking of the \"Russia thing\" when he made the decision to sack him.\n\nTime in post?\n\nThree years, eight months. Less than four months under Mr Trump.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nSince leaving he has been highly critical of the Trump administration.\n\nIn August 2019, a Department of Justice report concluded that, after losing his job, Mr Comey divulged unclassified information from a memo he had written on his private conversations with Mr Trump.\n\nIt ruled that he broke FBI rules by giving the contents of a memo to a friend so that it could be shared with a reporter. But the inspector general did not recommend Mr Comey be sued for the breach.\n\nMichael Flynn, National Security Adviser - 13 February 2017\n\nTechnically, Michael Flynn resigned, but he was asked to do so by the president.\n\nHis departure followed weeks of deepening scandal in which it emerged that he had misled White House officials, including the vice-president, over his contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\n\nMr Flynn has admitted to lying to the FBI about their pair discussing US sanctions against Russia with Mr Kislyak before Mr Trump took office.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nIt is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy, and once it was established that Mr Flynn had lied about his contact with Mr Kislyak there was no question that he had to go.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the president needed the time to investigate Mr Flynn and establish his guilt, but the scandal prompted fierce speculation over what the president knew of Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak.\n\nTime in post?\n\n23 days.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI. In June 2020, a federal court moved to dismiss charges against him.\n\nSally Yates, Acting Attorney General - 30 January 2017\n\nThe president fired Sally Yates after she questioned the legality of Mr Trump's travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMs Yates, who was appointed by Barack Obama, believed it discriminated unconstitutionally against Muslims, and ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce the president's executive order.\n\nWhy was she sacked?\n\nA White House statement said Ms Yates had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States\".\n\nIt also described her as \"weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration\".\n\nTime in post?\n\n10 days. She previously served as deputy attorney general from May 2015 until January 2017.\n\nWhat is she doing now?\n\nMs Yates is a partner at law firm King & Spalding, and lectures at Georgetown University Law Centre.\n\nPreet Bharara, New York federal prosecutor - 11 March 2017\n\nIt is not uncommon for prosecutors appointed by the previous administration to be replaced as the White House changes hands, but the widely-respected Preet Bharara had been told specifically by the Trump administration that he would be kept on.\n\nAt the time of his sacking, he was overseeing several high-profile cases, including allegations of sexual harassment at Trump favourite Fox News.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nMr Bharara was one of 46 prosecutors asked to resign by the Trump administration, which contended that it was part of a simple changing of the guard.\n\nBut there was speculation among Democrats and others that Mr Bahara's jurisdiction, which included Trump Tower, may have concerned the president.\n\nTime in post?\n\nSeven years, seven months. Less than two months under Mr Trump.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nMr Bharara is a Scholar in Residence at New York University Law School, and co-hosts a legal podcast called \"Cafe Insider\".\n\nPaul Manafort, Chair of Trump's presidential campaign\n\nPaul Manafort, a long-time Republican political operative, was supposed to marshal some of the chaos around Mr Trump but ended up falling prey to it.\n\nHe was sacked after five months with Mr Trump's campaign, three of those as campaign chair.\n\nWhy was he sacked?\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't give a reason for Mr Manafort's departure, issuing only a statement wishing him well.\n\nBut a wave of reports in the week before the announcement alleged that Mr Manafort had received secret cash payments from a pro-Russian political party for representing Russian interests in Ukraine and the US.\n\nHe has since been jailed for hiding $55m (Â£42m) from US tax authorities - money he was paid by pro-Russia politicians.\n\nTime in post?\n\nThree months.\n\nWhat is he doing now?\n\nManafort is serving a more than seven-year sentence for fraud.\n\nHe was released from prison in May 2020 after his lawyers argued that he was at high risk of contracting coronavirus. He is serving the rest of his sentence under home confinement."
