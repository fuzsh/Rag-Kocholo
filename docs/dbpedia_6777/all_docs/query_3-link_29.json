The staff of the Committee on the Judiciary first produced a report addressing this topic in 1974, during the impeachment inquiry into President Richard M. Nixon, and that report was updated by the majority and minority staff in 1998, during the impeachment inquiry into President William Jefferson Clinton. Over the past several decades, however, legal scholars and historians have undertaken a substantial study of the subject. The earlier reports remain useful points of reference, but no longer reflect the best available learning on questions relating to presidential impeachment. Further, they do not address several issues of constitutional law with particular relevance to the ongoing impeachment inquiry respecting President Donald J. Trump. For that reason, the majority staff of the Committee have prepared this report for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary. The views and conclusions contained in the report are staff views and do not necessarily reflect those of the Committee on the Judiciary or any of its members. Amy Rutkin, Chief of Staff.

Introduction Our President holds the ultimate public trust. He is vested with powers so great that they frightened the Framers of our Constitution; in exchange, he swears an oath to faithfully execute the laws that hold those powers in check. This oath is no formality. The Framers foresaw that a faithless President could destroy their experiment in democracy. As George Mason warned at the Constitutional Convention, held in Philadelphia in 1787, ``if we do not provide against corruption, our government will soon be at an end.'' \\1\\ Mason evoked a well- known historical truth: when corrupt motives take root, they drive an endless thirst for power and contempt for checks and balances. It is then only the smallest of steps toward acts of oppression and assaults on free and fair elections. A President faithful only to himself--who will sell out democracy and national security for his own personal advantage--is a danger to every American. Indeed, he threatens America itself. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Max Farrand, ed., The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, 392 (1911) (hereinafter, ``Records of the Federal Convention''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Impeachment is the Constitution's final answer to a President who mistakes himself for a monarch. Aware that power corrupts, our Framers built other guardrails against that error. The Constitution thus separates governmental powers, imposes an oath of faithful execution, prohibits profiting from office, and guarantees accountability through regular elections. But the Framers were not naive. They knew, and feared, that someday a corrupt executive might claim he could do anything he wanted as President. Determined to protect our democracy, the Framers built a safety valve into the Constitution: A President can be removed from office if the House of Representatives approves articles of impeachment charging him with ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' and if two-thirds of the Senate votes to find the President guilty of such misconduct after a trial.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 4; id. Art. I, Sec. 5, cl. 5; id. Art. I, Sec. 3, cl. 6. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As Justice Joseph Story recognized, ``the power of impeachment is not one expected in any government to be in constant or frequent exercise.'' \\3\\ When faced with credible evidence of extraordinary wrongdoing, however, it is incumbent on the House to investigate and determine whether impeachment is warranted. On October 31, 2019, the House approved H. Res. 660, which, among other things, confirmed the preexisting inquiry ``into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America.'' \\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 221 (1833). \\4\\ H. Res. 660, 116th Cong. (2019). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Judiciary Committee now faces questions of extraordinary importance. In prior impeachment inquiries addressing allegations of Presidential misconduct, the staff of the Judiciary Committee has prepared reports addressing relevant principles of constitutional law.\\5\\ Consistent with that practice, and to assist the Committee and the House in working toward a resolution of the questions before them, this staff report explores the meaning of the words in the Constitution's Impeachment Clause: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' It also describes the impeachment process and addresses several mistaken claims about impeachment that have recently drawn public notice. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Staff of H.

Print 1998) (hereinafter ``Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment: Modern Precedents (1998)''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- II. Summary of Principal Conclusions Our principal conclusions are as follows. The purpose of impeachment. As the Framers deliberated in Philadelphia, Mason posed a profound question: ``Shall any man be above justice?'' \\6\\ By authorizing Congress to remove Presidents for egregious misconduct, the Framers offered a resounding answer. As Mason elaborated, ``some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen.'' \\7\\ Unlike Britain's monarch, the President would answer personally--to Congress and thus to the Nation--if he engaged in serious wrongdoing. Alexander Hamilton explained that the President would have no more resemblance to the British king than to ``the Grand Seignior, to the khan of Tartary, [or] to the Man of the Seven Mountains.'' \\8\\ Whereas ``the person of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable,'' the President of the United States could be ``impeached, tried, and upon conviction . . . removed from office.'' \\9\\ Critically, though, impeachment goes no further. It results only in loss of political power. This speaks to the nature of impeachment: it exists not to inflict punishment for past wrongdoing, but rather to save the Nation from misconduct that endangers democracy and the rule of law. Thus, the ultimate question in an impeachment is whether leaving the President in our highest office imperils the Constitution.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 65. \\7\\ 1 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 86. \\8\\ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69, 444 (Benjamin Fletcher Wright ed., 2004). \\9\\ Id. \\10\\ See Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 155 (3d ed. 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Impeachable offenses. The Framers were careful students of history and knew that threats to democracy can take many forms. They feared would-be monarchs, but also warned against fake populists, charismatic demagogues, and corrupt kleptocrats. The Framers thus intended impeachment to reach the full spectrum of Presidential misconduct that menaced the Constitution. Because they could not anticipate and prohibit every threat a President might someday pose, the Framers adopted a standard sufficiently general and flexible to meet unknown future circumstances: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' This standard was proposed by Mason and was meant, in his words, to capture all manner of ``great and dangerous offenses'' against the Constitution.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 550. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Treason and bribery. Applying traditional tools of interpretation puts a sharper point on this definition of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' For starters, it is useful to consider the two impeachable offenses that the Framers identified for us. ``Treason'' is an unforgiveable betrayal of the Nation and its security. A President who levies war against the government, or lends aid and comfort to our enemies, cannot persist in office; a President who betrays the Nation once will most certainly do so again. ``Bribery,'' in turn, sounds in abuse of power. Impeachable bribery occurs when the President offers, solicits, or accepts something of personal value to influence his own official actions. By rendering such bribery impeachable, the Framers sought to ensure that the Nation could expel a leader who would sell out the interests of ``We the People'' for his own personal gain. In identifying ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' we are guided by the text and structure of the Constitution, the records of the Constitutional Convention and state ratifying debates, and the history of impeachment practice. These sources demonstrate that the Framers principally intended impeachment for three overlapping forms of Presidential wrongdoing: (1) abuse of power, (2) betrayal of the nation through foreign entanglements, and (3) corruption of office and elections. Any one of these violations of the public trust justifies impeachment; when combined in a single course of conduct, they state the strongest possible case for impeachment and removal from office. Abuse of power. There are at least as many ways to abuse power as there are powers vested in the President. It would thus be an exercise in futility to attempt a list of every abuse of power constituting ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' That said, impeachable abuse of power can be roughly divided into two categories: engaging in official acts forbidden by law and engaging in official action with motives forbidden by law. As James Iredell explained, ``the president would be liable to impeachments [if] he had . . . acted from some corrupt motive or other.'' \\12\\ This warning echoed Edmund Randolph's teaching that impeachment must be allowed because ``the Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.'' \\13\\ President Richard Nixon's conduct has come to exemplify impeachable abuse of power: he acted with corrupt motives in obstructing justice and using official power to target his political opponents, and his decision to unlawfully defy subpoenas issued by the House impeachment inquiry was unconstitutional on its face. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Quoted in Background and History of Impeachment: Hearing before the Subcomm. On the Constitution of the H. Comm on the Judiciary, 105th Cong. 49 (1999) (hereinafter ``1998 Background and History of Impeachment Hearing''). \\13\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention at 67. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Betrayal involving foreign powers. As much as the Framers feared abuse, they feared betrayal still more. That anxiety is shot through their discussion of impeachment--and explains why ``Treason'' heads the Constitution's list of impeachable offenses. James Madison put it simply: the President ``might betray his trust to foreign powers.'' \\14\\ Although the Framers did not intend impeachment for good faith disagreements on matters of diplomacy, they were explicit that betrayal of the Nation through schemes with foreign powers justified that remedy. Indeed, foreign interference in the American political system was among the gravest dangers feared by the Founders of our Nation and the Framers of our Constitution. In his farewell address, George Washington thus warned Americans ``to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.'' \\15\\ And in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, John Adams wrote: ``You are apprehensive of foreign Interference, Intrigue, Influence. So am I. But, as often as Elections happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.'' \\16\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Id., at 65-66. \\15\\ George Washington Farewell Address (1796), George Washington Papers, Series 2, Letterbooks 1754-1799: Letterbook 24, April 3, 1793- March 3, 1797, Library of Congress. \\16\\ To Thomas Jefferson from John Adams, 6 December 1787, National Archives, Founders Online. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Corruption. Lurking beneath the Framers' discussion of impeachment was the most ancient and implacable foe of democracy: corruption. The Framers saw no shortage of threats to the Republic, and sought to guard against them, ``but the big fear underlying all the small fears was whether they'd be able to control corruption.'' \\17\\ As Madison put it, corruption ``might be fatal to the Republic.'' \\18\\ This was not just a matter of thwarting bribes; it was a far more expansive challenge. The Framers celebrated civic virtue and love of country; they wrote rules to ensure officials would not use public power for private gain. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ Zephyr Teachout, Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United 57 (2014). \\18\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 66. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Impeachment was seen as especially necessary for Presidential conduct corrupting our system of political self- government. That concern arose in multiple contexts as the Framers debated the Constitution. The most important was the risk that Presidents would place their personal interest in re- election above our bedrock national commitment to democracy. The Framers knew that corrupt leaders concentrate power by manipulating elections and undercutting adversaries. They despised King George III, who ``resorted to influencing the electoral process and the representatives in Parliament in order to gain [his] treacherous ends.'' \\19\\ That is why the Framers deemed electoral treachery a central ground for impeachment. The very premise of the Constitution is that the American people govern themselves, and choose their leaders, through free and fair elections. When the President concludes that elections might threaten his grasp on power and abuses his office to sabotage opponents or invite inference, he rejects democracy itself and must be removed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ Gordon S. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776- 1787 33 (1998). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conclusions regarding the nature of impeachable offenses. In sum, history teaches that ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' referred mainly to acts committed by public officials, using their power or privileges, that inflicted grave harm on our political order. Such great and dangerous offenses included treason, bribery, serious abuse of power, betrayal of the national interest through foreign entanglements, and corruption of office and elections. They were unified by a clear theme: officials who abused, abandoned, or sought personal benefit from their public trust--and who threatened the rule of law if left in power--faced impeachment. Each of these acts, moreover, should be plainly wrong to reasonable officials and persons of honor. When a political official uses political power in ways that substantially harm our political system, Congress can strip them of that power. Within these parameters, and guided by fidelity to the Constitution, the House must judge whether the President's misconduct is grave enough to require impeachment. That step must never be taken lightly. It is a momentous act, justified only when the President's full course of conduct, assessed without favor or prejudice, is ``seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties of the presidential office.'' \\20\\ But when that high standard is met, the Constitution calls the House to action--and the House, in turn, must rise to the occasion. In such cases, a decision not to impeach can harm democracy and set an ominous precedent. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, Impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, H.R. Rep. No. 93-1305 8 (1974) (hereinafter ``Committee Report on Nixon Articles of Impeachment (1974)''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The criminality issue. It is occasionally suggested that Presidents can be impeached only if they have committed crimes. That position was rejected in President Nixon's case, and then rejected again in President Clinton's, and should be rejected once more. Offenses against the Constitution are different than offenses against the criminal code. Some crimes, like jaywalking, are not impeachable. And some forms of misconduct may offend both the Constitution and the criminal law. Impeachment and criminality must therefore be assessed separately--even though the President's commission of indictable crimes may further support a case for impeachment and removal. Ultimately, the House must judge whether a President's conduct offends and endangers the Constitution itself. Fallacies about impeachment. In the final section of this Report, we briefly address six falsehoods about impeachment that have recently drawn public notice. First, contrary to mistaken claims otherwise, we demonstrate that the current impeachment inquiry has complied in every respect with the Constitution, the Rules of the House, and historic practice and precedent of the House. Second, we address several evidentiary matters. The House impeachment inquiry has compiled substantial direct and circumstantial evidence bearing on the issues at hand. Nonetheless, President Trump has objected that some of the evidence gathered by the House comes from witnesses lacking first-hand knowledge of his conduct. But in the same breath, he has unlawfully ordered many witnesses with first-hand knowledge to defy House subpoenas. As we show, President Trump's assertions regarding the evidence before the House are misplaced as a matter of constitutional law and common sense. Third, we consider President Trump's claim that his actions are protected because of his right under Article II of the Constitution ``to do whatever I want as president.'' \\21\\ This claim is wrong, and profoundly so, because our Constitution rejects pretensions to monarchy and binds Presidents with law. That is true even of powers vested exclusively in the chief executive. If those powers are invoked for corrupt reasons, or wielded in an abusive manner harming the constitutional system, the President is subject to impeachment for ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' This is a core premise of the impeachment power. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ Remarks by President Trump at Turning Point USA's Teen Student Action Summit 2019, July 23, 2019, The White House. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourth, we address whether the House must accept at face value President Trump's claim that his motives were not corrupt. In short, no. When the House probes a President's state of mind, its mandate is to find the facts. That means evaluating the President's account of his motives to see if it rings true. The question is not whether the President's conduct could have resulted from permissible motives. It is whether the President's real reasons, the ones in his mind at the time, were legitimate. Where the House discovers persuasive evidence of corrupt wrongdoing, it is entitled to rely upon that evidence to impeach. Fifth, we explain that attempted Presidential wrongdoing is impeachable. Mason himself said so at the Constitutional Convention, where he described ``attempts to subvert the Constitution'' as a core example of ``great and dangerous offenses.'' \\22\\ Moreover, the Judiciary Committee reached the same conclusion in President Nixon's case. Historical precedent thus confirms that ineptitude and insubordination do not afford the President a defense to impeachment. A President cannot escape impeachment just because his scheme to abuse power, betray the nation, or corrupt elections was discovered and abandoned. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ Cass R. Sunstein, Impeachment: A Citizen's Guide 47 (2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, we consider whether impeachment ``nullifies'' the last election or denies voters their voice in the next one. The Framers themselves weighed this question. They considered relying solely on elections--rather than impeachment--to remove wayward Presidents. That position was firmly rejected. No President is entitled to persist in office after committing ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' and no one who voted for him in the last election is entitled to expect he will do so. Where the President's misconduct is aimed at corrupting elections, relying on elections to solve the problem is no safeguard at all. III. The Purpose of Impeachment Freedom must not be taken for granted. It demands constant protection from leaders whose taste of power sparks a voracious need for more. Time and again, republics have fallen to officials who care little for the law and use the public trust for private gain. The Framers of the Constitution knew this well. They saw corruption erode the British constitution from within. They heard kings boast of their own excellence while conspiring with foreign powers and consorting with shady figures. As talk of revolution spread, they objected as King George III used favors and party politics to control Parliament, aided by men who sold their souls and welcomed oppression. The Framers risked their freedom, and their lives, to escape that monarchy. So did their families and many of their friends. Together, they resolved to build a nation committed to democracy and the rule of law--a beacon to the world in an age of aristocracy. In the United States of America, ``We the People'' would be sovereign. We would choose our own leaders and hold them accountable for how they exercised power. As they designed our government at the Constitutional Convention, however, the Framers faced a dilemma. On the one hand, many of them embraced the need for a powerful chief executive. This had been cast into stark relief by the failure of the Nation's very first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, which put Congress in charge at the federal level. The ensuing discord led James Madison to warn, ``it is not possible that a government can last long under these circumstances.'' \\23\\ The Framers therefore created the Presidency. A single official could lead the Nation with integrity, energy, and dispatch--and would be held personally responsible for honoring that immense public trust. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\23\\ Quoted in id., at 27. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Power, though, is a double-edged sword. ``The power to do good meant also the power to do harm, the power to serve the republic also meant the power to demean and defile it.'' \\24\\ The President would be vested with breathtaking authority. If corrupt motives took root in his mind, displacing civic virtue and love of country, he could sabotage the Constitution. That was clear to the Framers, who saw corruption as ``the great force that had undermined republics throughout history.'' \\25\\ Obsessed with the fall of Rome, they knew that corruption marked a leader's path to abuse and betrayal. Mason thus emphasized, ``if we do not provide against corruption, our government will soon be at an end.'' This warning against corruption--echoed no fewer than 54 times by 15 delegates at the Convention--extended far beyond bribes and presents. To the Framers, corruption was fundamentally about the misuse of a position of public trust for any improper private benefit. It thus went to the heart of their conception of public service. As a leading historian recounts, ``a corrupt political actor would either purposely ignore or forget the public good as he used the reins of power.'' \\26\\ Because men and women are not angels, corruption could not be fully eradicated, even in virtuous officials, but ``its power can be subdued with the right combination of culture and political rules.'' \\27\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Imperial Presidency 415 (1973). \\25\\ Elizabeth B. Wydra & Brianne J. Gorod, The First Magistrate in Foreign Pay, The New Republic, Nov. 11, 2019. \\26\\ Teachout, Corruption in America, at 48. \\27\\ Id., at 47. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Framers therefore erected safeguards against Presidential abuse. Most famously, they divided power among three branches of government that had the means and motive to balance each other. ``Ambition,'' Madison reasoned, ``must be made to counteract ambition.'' \\28\\ In addition, the Framers subjected the President to election every four years and established the Electoral College (which, they hoped, would select virtuous, capable leaders and refuse to re-elect corrupt or unpopular ones). Finally, the Framers imposed on the President a duty to faithfully execute the laws--and required him to accept that duty in a solemn oath.\\29\\ To the Framers, the concept of faithful execution was profoundly important. It prohibited the President from taking official acts in bad faith or with corrupt intent, as well as acts beyond what the law authorized.\\30\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ James Madison, Federalist No. 51, at 356. \\29\\ U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 8. \\30\\ See Andrew Kent, Ethan J. Leib & Jed Handelsman Shugerman, Faithful Execution and Article II, 132 Harv. L. Rev. 2111-2121 (2019). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A few Framers would have stopped there. This minority feared vesting any branch of government with the power to end a Presidency; as they saw it, even extreme Presidential wrongdoing could be managed in the normal course (mainly by periodic elections). That view was decisively rejected. As Professor Raoul Berger writes, ``the Framers were steeped in English history; the shades of despotic kings and conniving ministers marched before them.'' \\31\\ Haunted by those lessons, and convening in the shadow of revolution, the Framers would not deny the Nation an escape from Presidents who deemed themselves above the law. So they turned to a mighty constitutional power, one that offered a peaceful and politically accountable method for ending an oppressive Presidency. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ Raoul Berger, Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems 4 (1974). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This was impeachment, a legal relic from the British past that over the preceding century had found a new lease on life in the North American colonies. First deployed in 1376--and wielded in fits and starts over the following 400 years-- impeachment allowed Parliament to charge royal ministers with abuse, remove them from office, and imprison them. Over time, impeachment helped Parliament shift power away from royal absolutism and encouraged more politically accountable administration. In 1679, it was thus proclaimed in the House of Commons that impeachment was ``the chief institution for the preservation of government.'' \\32\\ That sentiment was echoed in the New World. Even as Parliamentary impeachment fell into disuse by the early 1700s, colonists in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts laid claim to this prerogative as part of their English birthright. During the revolution, ten states ratified constitutions allowing the impeachment of executive officials--and put that power to use in cases of corruption and abuse of power.\\33\\ Unlike in Britain, though, American impeachment did not result in fines or jailtime. It simply removed officials from political power when their conduct required it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ Id., at 1 n.2. \\33\\ Frank O. Bowman, III, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump 72 (2019). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Familiar with the use of impeachment to address lawless officials, the Framers offered a clear answer to Mason's question at the Constitutional Convention, ``Shall any man be above justice''? \\34\\ As Mason himself explained, ``some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen.'' \\35\\ Future Vice President Elbridge Gerry agreed, adding that impeachment repudiates the fallacy that our ``chief magistrate could do no wrong.'' \\36\\ Benjamin Franklin, in turn, made the case that impeachment is ``the best way'' to assess claims of serious wrongdoing by a President; without it, those accusations would fester unresolved and invite enduring conflict over Presidential malfeasance.\\37\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 65-67. \\35\\ 1 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 66. \\36\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 66. \\37\\ James Madison, Notes on Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 332 (1987). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unlike in Britain, the President would answer personally-- to Congress and thus to the Nation--for any serious wrongdoing. For that reason, as Hamilton later explained, the President would have no more resemblance to the British king than to ``the Grand Seignior, to the khan of Tartary, [or] to the Man of the Seven Mountains.'' \\38\\ Whereas ``the person of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable,'' the President could be ``impeached, tried, and upon conviction . . . removed from office.'' \\39\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\38\\ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69, at 444. \\39\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Of course, the decision to subject the President to impeachment was not the end of the story. The Framers also had to specify how this would work in practice. After long and searching debate they made three crucial decisions, each of which sheds light on their understanding of impeachment's proper role in our constitutional system. First, they limited the consequences of impeachment to ``removal from Office'' and ``disqualification'' from future officeholding.\\40\\ To the extent the President's wrongful conduct also breaks the law, the Constitution expressly reserves criminal punishment for the ordinary processes of criminal law. In that respect, ``the consequences of impeachment and conviction go just far enough, and no further than, to remove the threat posed to the Republic by an unfit official.'' \\41\\ This speaks to the very nature of impeachment: it exists not to inflict personal punishment for past wrongdoing, but rather to protect against future Presidential misconduct that would endanger democracy and the rule of law.\\42\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ U.S. Const.

As James Iredell explained during debates over whether to ratify the Constitution, ``this power is lodged in those who represent the great body of the people, because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of great injury to the community.'' \\44\\ The Senate, in turn, holds ``the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' \\45\\ When the Senate sits as a court of impeachment for the President, each Senator must swear a special oath, the Chief Justice of the United States presides, and conviction requires ``the concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.'' \\46\\ By designating Congress to accuse the President and conduct his trial, the Framers confirmed--in Hamilton's words--that impeachment concerns an ``abuse or violation of some public trust'' with ``injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' \\47\\ Impeachment is reserved for offenses against our political system. It is therefore prosecuted and judged by Congress, speaking for the Nation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ U.S. Const. Art.

The President cannot be removed based on poor management, general incompetence, or unpopular policies. Instead, the question in any impeachment inquiry is whether the President has engaged in misconduct justifying an early end to his term in office: ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \\48\\ This phrase had a particular legal meaning to the Framers. It is to that understanding, and to its application in prior Presidential impeachments, that we now turn. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 4. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IV. Impeachable Offenses As careful students of history, the Framers knew that threats to democracy can take many forms. They feared would-be monarchs, but also warned against fake populists, charismatic demagogues, and corrupt kleptocrats. In describing the kind of leader who might menace the Nation, Hamilton offered an especially striking portrait: When a man unprincipled in private life[,] desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper . . . known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty --when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity--to join in the cry of danger to liberty--to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion--to flatter and fall in with all the non sense [sic] of the zealots of the day--It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.\\49\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ Alexander Hamilton, ``Objections and Answers respecting the Administration of the Government,'' Founders Online, National Archives. This prophesy echoed Hamilton's warning, in Federalist No. 1, that ``of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.'' \\50\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\50\\ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1, at 91. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Framers thus intended impeachment to reach the full spectrum of Presidential misconduct that threatened the Constitution. They also intended our Constitution to endure for the ages. Because they could not anticipate and specifically prohibit every threat a President might someday pose, the Framers adopted a standard sufficiently general and flexible to meet unknown future circumstances. This standard was meant--as Mason put it--to capture all manner of ``great and dangerous offenses'' incompatible with the Constitution. When the President uses the powers of his high office to benefit himself, while injuring or ignoring the American people he is oath-bound to serve, he has committed an impeachable offense. Applying the tools of legal interpretation, as we do below, puts a sharper point on this definition of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' It also confirms that the Framers principally aimed the impeachment power at a few core evils, each grounded in a unifying fear that a President might abandon his duty to faithfully execute the laws. Where the President engages in serious abuse of power, betrays the national interest through foreign entanglements, or corrupts his office or elections, he has undoubtedly committed ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as understood by the Framers. Any one of these violations of the public trust is impeachable. When combined in a scheme to advance the President's personal interests while ignoring or injuring the Constitution, they state the strongest possible case for impeachment and removal from office. A. Lessons From British and Early American History As Hamilton recounted, Britain afforded ``[t]he model from which the idea of [impeachment] has been borrowed.'' \\51\\ That was manifestly true of the phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The Framers could have authorized impeachment for ``crimes'' or ``serious crimes.'' Or they could have followed the practice of many American state constitutions and permitted impeachment for ``maladministration'' or ``malpractice.'' \\52\\ But they instead selected a ``unique phrase used for centuries in English parliamentary impeachments.'' \\53\\ To understand their choice requires a quick tour through history. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\51\\ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 65, at 427. \\52\\ Bowman, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, at 65-72. \\53\\ Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment (1974), at 4. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- That tour offers two lessons. The first is that the phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' was used only for parliamentary impeachments; it was never used in the ordinary criminal law.\\54\\ Moreover, in the 400-year history of British impeachments, the House of Commons impeached many officials on grounds that did not involve any discernibly criminal conduct. Indeed, the House of Commons did so yet again just as the Framers gathered in Philadelphia. That same month, Edmund Burke--the celebrated champion of American liberty--brought twenty-two articles of impeachment against Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India. Burke charged Hastings with offenses including abuse of power, corruption, disregarding treaty obligations, and misconduct of local wars. Historians have confirmed that ``none of the charges could fairly be classed as criminal conduct in any technical sense.'' \\55\\ Aware of that fact, Burke accused Hastings of ``[c]rimes, not against forms, but against those eternal laws of justice, which are our rule and our birthright: his offenses are not in formal, technical language, but in reality, in substance and effect, High Crimes and High Misdemeanors.'' \\56\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\54\\ See id. \\55\\ Bowman, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, at 41. \\56\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Burke's denunciation of Hastings points to the second lesson from British history: ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' were understood as offenses against the constitutional system itself. This is confirmed by use of the word ``high,'' as well as Parliamentary practice. From 1376 to 1787, the House of Commons impeached officials on seven general grounds: (1) abuse of power; (2) betrayal of the nation's security and foreign policy; (3) corruption; (4) armed rebellion [a.k.a. treason]; (5) bribery; (6) neglect of duty; and (7) violating Parliament's constitutional prerogatives.\\57\\ To the Framers and their contemporaries learned in the law, the phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' would have called to mind these offenses against the body politic. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ Id., at 46; Berger, Impeachment, at 70. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The same understanding prevailed on this side of the Atlantic. In the colonial period and under newly-ratified state constitutions, most impeachments targeted abuse of power, betrayal of the revolutionary cause, corruption, treason, and bribery.\\58\\ Many Framers at the Constitutional Convention had participated in drafting their state constitutions, or in colonial and state removal proceedings, and were steeped in this outlook on impeachment. Further, the Framers knew well the Declaration of Independence, ``whose bill of particulars against King George III modeled what [we would] now view as articles of impeachment.'' \\59\\ That bill of particulars did not dwell on technicalities of criminal law, but rather charged the king with a ``long train of abuses and usurpations,'' including misuse of power, efforts to obstruct and undermine elections, and violating individual rights.\\60\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\58\\ See Peter Charles Hoffer & N. E. H. Hull, Impeachment in America, 1635-1805 1-106 (1984). \\59\\ Laurence H. Tribe & Joshua Matz, To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment 7 (2018). \\60\\ The Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, et al, July 4, 1776, Copy of Declaration of Independence, Library of Congress. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- History thus teaches that ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' referred mainly to acts committed by public officials, using their power or privileges, that inflicted grave harm on society itself. Such great and dangerous offenses included treason, bribery, abuse of power, betrayal of the nation, and corruption of office. They were unified by a clear theme: officials who abused, abandoned, or sought personal benefit from their public trust--and who threatened the rule of law if left in power-- faced impeachment and removal. B. Treason and Bribery For the briefest of moments at the Constitutional Convention, it appeared as though Presidential impeachment might be restricted to ``treason, or bribery.'' \\61\\ But when this suggestion reached the floor, Mason revolted. With undisguised alarm, he warned that such limited grounds for impeachment would miss ``attempts to subvert the Constitution,'' as well as ``many great and dangerous offenses.'' \\62\\ Here he invoked the charges pending in Parliament against Hastings as a case warranting impeachment for reasons other than treason. To ``extend the power of impeachments,'' Mason initially suggested adding ``or maladministration'' after ``treason, or bribery.'' \\63\\ Madison, however, objected that ``so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.'' \\64\\ In response, Mason substituted ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \\65\\ Apparently pleased with Mason's compromise, the Convention accepted his proposal and moved on. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\61\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 550. \\62\\ Id. \\63\\ Id. \\64\\ Id \\65\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This discussion confirms that Presidential impeachment is warranted for all manner of great and dangerous offenses that subvert the Constitution. It also sheds helpful light on the nature of impeachable offenses: in identifying ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' we can start with two that the Framers identified for us, ``Treason'' and ``Bribery.'' 1. IMPEACHABLE TREASON Under Article III of the Constitution, ``treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.'' \\66\\ In other words, a person commits treason if he uses armed force in an attempt to overthrow the government, or if he knowingly gives aid and comfort to nations (or organizations) with which the United States is in a state of declared or open war. At the very heart of ``Treason'' is deliberate betrayal of the nation and its security. Such betrayal would not only be unforgivable, but would also confirm that the President remains a threat if allowed to remain in office. A President who has knowingly betrayed national security is a President who will do so again. He endangers our lives and those of our allies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\66\\ U.S. Const. Art. III, 3, cl. 1. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. IMPEACHABLE BRIBERY The essence of impeachable bribery is a government official's exploitation of his or her public duties for personal gain. To the Framers, it was received wisdom that nothing can be ``a greater Temptation to Officers [than] to abuse their Power by Bribery and Extortion.'' \\67\\ To guard against that risk, the Framers authorized the impeachment of a President who offers, solicits, or accepts something of personal value to influence his own official actions. By rendering such ``Bribery'' impeachable, the Framers sought to ensure that the Nation could expel a leader who would sell out the interests of ``We the People'' to achieve his own personal gain. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\67\\ William Hawkins, A Treatise of Pleas to the Crown, ch. 67, Sec. 3 (1716). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unlike ``Treason,'' which is defined in Article III, ``Bribery'' is not given an express definition in the Constitution. But as Justice Joseph Story explained, a ``proper exposition of the nature and limits of this offense'' can be found in the Anglo-American common law tradition known well to our Framers.\\68\\ That understanding, in turn, can be refined by reference to the Constitution's text and the records of the Constitutional Convention.\\69\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\68\\ 2 Story, Commentaries, at 263; see also H.R. Rep. No. 946, at 19 (1912). \\69\\ For example, while the English common law tradition principally addressed itself to judicial bribery, the Framers repeatedly made clear at the Constitutional Convention that they intended to subject the President to impeachment for bribery. They confirmed this intention in the Impeachment Clause, which authorizes the impeachment of ``[t]he President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States'' for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' U.S. Const., Art. 2, Sec. 4. It is therefore proper to draw upon common law principles and to apply them to the office of the Presidency. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To start with common law: At the time of the Constitutional Convention, bribery was well understood in Anglo-American law to encompass offering, soliciting, or accepting bribes. In 1716, for example, William Hawkins defined bribery in an influential treatise as ``the receiving or offering of any undue reward, by or to any person whatsoever . . . in order to incline him to do a thing against the known rules of honesty and integrity.'' \\70\\ This description of the offense was echoed many times over the following decades. In a renowned bribery case involving the alleged solicitation of bribes, Lord Mansfield agreed that ``[w]herever it is a crime to take, it is a crime to give: they are reciprocal.'' \\71\\ Two years later, William Blackstone confirmed that ``taking bribes is punished,'' just as bribery is punishable for ``those who offer a bribe, though not taken.'' \\72\\ Soliciting a bribe--even if it is not accepted--thus qualified as bribery at common law. Indeed, it was clear under the common law that ``the attempt is a crime; it is complete on his side who offers it.'' \\73\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\70\\ Hawkins, A Treatise of Pleas to the Crown, ch. 67, Sec. 2 (1716). \\71\\ Rex v. Vaughan, 98 Eng. Rep. 308, 311 (K.B. 1769). \\72\\ William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Vol. 2, Book 4, Ch. 10, Sec. 17 (1771). \\73\\ Rex v. Vaughan, 98 Eng. Rep. 308, 311 (K.B. 1769). American courts have subsequently repeated this precise formulation. See, e.g., State v. Ellis, 33 N.J.L. 102, 104 (N.J. Sup. Ct. 1868) (``The offence is complete when an offer or reward is made to influence the vote or action of the official.''); see also William O. Russell, A Treatise on Crimes and Misdemeanors 239-240 (1st American Ed) (1824) (``The law abhors the least tendency to corruption; and up on the principle which has been already mentioned, of an attempt to commit even a misdemeanor, being itself a misdemeanor, (f) attempts to bribe, though unsuccessful, have in several cases been held to be criminal.''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Framers adopted that principle into the Constitution. As Judge John Noonan explains, the drafting history of the Impeachment Clause demonstrates that `` `Bribery' was read both actively and passively, including the chief magistrate bribing someone and being bribed.'' \\74\\ Many scholars of Presidential impeachment have reached the same conclusion.\\75\\ Impeachable ``Bribery'' thus covers--inter alia--the offer, solicitation, or acceptance of something of personal value by the President to influence his own official actions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\74\\ John T. Noonan, Jr., Bribes: The Intellectual History of a Moral Idea, 430 (1984). \\75\\ As Professor Bowman writes, bribery was ``a common law crime that developed from a narrow beginning'' to reach ``giving, and offering to give, [any] improper rewards.'' Bowman, High Crimes & Misdemeanors, at 243; see also, e.g., Tribe & Matz, To End A Presidency, at 33 (``The corrupt exercise of power in exchange for a personal benefit defines impeachable bribery. That's self-evidently true whenever the president receives bribes to act a certain way. But it's also true when the president offers bribes to other officials--for example, to a federal judge, a legislator, or a member of the Electoral College . . . In either case, the president is fully complicit in a grave degradation of power, and he can never again be trusted to act as a faithful public servant.''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This conclusion draws still more support from a closely related part of the common law. In the late-17th century, ``bribery'' was a relatively new offense, and was understood as overlapping with the more ancient common law crime of ``extortion.'' \\76\\ ``Extortion,'' in turn, was defined as the ``abuse of public justice, which consists in any officer's unlawfully taking, by colour of his office, from any man, any money or thing of value, that is not due to him, or more than is due, or before it is due.'' \\77\\ Under this definition, both bribery and extortion occurred when an official used his public position to obtain private benefits to which he was not entitled. Conduct which qualified as bribery was therefore ``routinely punished as common law extortion.'' \\78\\ To the Framers, who would have seen bribery and extortion as virtually coextensive, when a President acted in his official capacity to offer, solicit, or accept an improper personal benefit, he committed ``Bribery.'' \\79\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\76\\ See James Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction Between Bribery and Extortion: From the Common Law to the Hobbs Act, 35 UCLA L. Rev. 815, 839 (1988). \\77\\ Blackstone, Commentaries, Vol. 2, Book 4, Ch. 10, Sec. 22 (1771) (citing 1 Hawk. P. C. 170); accord Giles Jacob, A New Law- Dictionary 102 (1782) (defining ``Extortion'' as ``an unlawful taking by an officer, &c. by colour of his office, of any money, or valuable thing, from a person where none at all is due, or not so much is due, or before it is due''). \\78\\ Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction, 35 UCLA L. Rev. at 839. \\79\\ For all the reasons given below in our discussion of the criminality issue, impeachable ``Bribery'' does not refer to the meaning of bribery under modern federal criminal statutes. See also Bowman, High Crimes & Misdemeanors, at 243-44; Tribe & Matz, To End A Presidency, at 31-33. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Turning to the nature of the improper personal benefit: because officials can be corrupted in many ways, the benefit at issue in a bribe can be anything of subjective personal value to the President. This is not limited to money. Indeed, given their purposes, it would have made no sense for the Framers to confine ``Bribery'' to the offer, solicitation, or acceptance of money, and they expressed no desire to impose that restriction. To the contrary, in guarding against foreign efforts to subvert American officials, they confirmed their broad view of benefits that might cause corruption: a person who holds ``any Office of Profit or Trust,'' such as the President, is forbidden from accepting ``any present, Office or Tile, of any kind whatever, from . . . a foreign State.'' \\80\\ An equally pragmatic (and capacious) view applies to the impeachable offense of ``Bribery.'' This view is further anchored in the very same 17th and 18th century common law treatises that were well known to the Framers. Those authorities used broad language in defining what qualifies as a ``thing of value'' in the context of bribery: ``any undue reward'' or any ``valuable consideration.'' \\81\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\80\\ U.S. Const, art. I, Sec. 9, cl.8. \\81\\ Hawkins, A Treatise of Pleas to the Crown, ch. 67, Sec. 2 (1716). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To summarize, impeachable ``Bribery'' occurs when a President offers, solicits, or accepts something of personal value to influence his own official actions. Bribery is thus an especially egregious and specific example of a President abusing his power for private gain. As Blackstone explained, bribery is ``the genius of despotic countries where the true principles of government are never understood''--and where ``it is imagined that there is no obligation from the superior to the inferior, no relative duty owing from the governor to the governed.'' \\82\\ In our democracy, the Framers understood that there is no place for Presidents who would abuse their power and betray the public trust through bribery. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\82\\ Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 4, Ch. 10 ``Of Offenses Against Public Justice'' (1765-1770). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Like ``Treason,'' the offense of ``Bribery'' is thus aimed at a President who is a continuing threat to the Constitution. Someone who would willingly assist our enemies, or trade public power for personal favors, is the kind of person likely to break the rules again if they remain in office. But there is more: both ``Treason'' and ``Bribery'' are serious offenses with the capacity to corrupt constitutional governance and harm the Nation itself; both involve wrongdoing that reveals the President as a continuing threat if left in power; and both offenses are ``plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor, or to a good citizen, regardless of words on the statute books.'' \\83\\ Looking to the Constitution's text and history-- including the British, colonial, and early American traditions discussed earlier--these characteristics also define ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\83\\ Charles L. Black Jr. & Philip Bobbitt, Impeachment: A Handbook, New Edition 34 (2018). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Abuse, Betrayal & Corruption With that understanding in place, the records of the Constitutional Convention offer even greater clarity. They demonstrate that the Framers principally intended impeachment for three forms of Presidential wrongdoing: serious abuse of power, betrayal of the national interest through foreign entanglements, and corruption of office and elections. When the President engages in such misconduct, and does so in ways that are recognizably wrong and injurious to our political system, impeachment is warranted. That is proven not only by debates surrounding adoption of the Constitution, but also by the historical practice of the House in exercising the impeachment power. 1. ABUSE OF POWER As Justice Robert Jackson wisely observed, ``the purpose of the Constitution was not only to grant power, but to keep it from getting out of hand.'' \\84\\ Nowhere is that truer than in the Presidency. As the Framers created a formidable chief executive, they made clear that impeachment is justified for serious abuse of power. Edmund Randolph was explicit on this point. In explaining why the Constitution must authorize Presidential impeachment, he warned that ``the Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.'' \\85\\ Madison, too, stated that impeachment is necessary because the President ``might pervert his administration into a scheme of . . . oppression.'' \\86\\ This theme echoed through the state ratifying conventions. Advocating that New York ratify the Constitution, Hamilton set the standard for impeachment at an ``abuse or violation of some public trust.'' \\87\\ In South Carolina, Charles Pinckney agreed that Presidents must be removed who ``behave amiss or betray their public trust.'' \\88\\ In Massachusetts, Reverend Samuel Stillman asked, ``With such a prospect [of impeachment], who will dare to abuse the powers vested in him by the people.'' \\89\\ Time and again, Americans who wrote and ratified the Constitution confirmed that Presidents may be impeached for abusing the power entrusted to them. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\84\\ Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 640 (Jackson, J., concurring). \\85\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 67. \\86\\ Id., at 65-66. \\87\\ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 65, at 426. \\88\\ Berger, Impeachment, at 89. \\89\\ 2 Elliot, Debates in the Several State Conventions, at 169. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- There are at least as many ways to abuse power as there are powers vested in the President. It would thus be an exercise in futility to attempt a list of every conceivable abuse constituting ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' That said, abuse of power was no vague notion to the Framers and their contemporaries. It had a very particular meaning to them. Impeachable abuse of power can take two basic forms: (1) the exercise of official power in a way that, on its very face, grossly exceeds the President's constitutional authority or violates legal limits on that authority; and (2) the exercise of official power to obtain an improper personal benefit, while ignoring or injuring the national interest. In other words, the President may commit an impeachable abuse of power in two different ways: by engaging in forbidden acts, or by engaging in potentially permissible acts but for forbidden reasons (e.g., with the corrupt motive of obtaining a personal political benefit). The first category involves conduct that is inherently and sharply inconsistent with the law--and that amounts to claims of monarchical prerogative. The generation that rebelled against King George III knew what absolute power looked like. The Framers had other ideas when they organized our government, and so they placed the chief executive within the bounds of law. That means the President may exercise only the powers expressly or impliedly vested in him by the Constitution, and he must also respect legal limits on the exercise of those powers (including the rights of Americans citizens). A President who refuses to abide these restrictions, thereby causing injury to society itself and engaging in recognizably wrongful conduct, may be subjected to impeachment for abuse of power. That principle also covers conduct grossly inconsistent with and subversive of the separation of powers. The Framers knew that ``[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.'' \\90\\ To protect liberty, they wrote a Constitution that creates a system of checks and balances within the federal government. Some of those rules are expressly enumerated in our founding charter; others are implied from its structure or from the history of inter-branch relations.\\91\\ When a President wields executive power in ways that usurp and destroy the prerogatives of Congress or the Judiciary, he exceeds the scope of his constitutional authority and violates limits on permissible conduct. Such abuses of power are therefore impeachable. That conclusion is further supported by the British origins of the phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'': Parliament repeatedly impeached ministers for ``subvert[ing] its conception of proper constitutional order in favor of the `arbitrary and tyrannical' government of ambitious monarchs and their grasping minions.'' \\91\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\90\\ James Madison, Federalist No. 47, at 336. \\91\\ See generally National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, et al., 573 U.S. 513 (2014). \\92\\ Bowman, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, at 109. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Supreme Court advanced similar logic in Ex Parte Grossman, which held the President can pardon officials who defy judicial orders and are held in criminal contempt of court.\\93\\ This holding raised an obvious concern: what if the President used ``successive pardons'' to ``deprive a court of power to enforce its orders''? \\94\\ That could fatally weaken the Judiciary's role under Article III of the Constitution. On behalf of a unanimous Court, Chief Justice William Howard Taft--who had previously served as President--explained that ``exceptional cases like this . . . would suggest a resort to impeachment.'' \\95\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\93\\ Ex Parte Grossman, 267 U.S. 87 (1925). \\94\\ Id., at 121. \\95\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Two impeachment inquiries have involved claims that a President grossly violated the Constitution's separation of powers. The first was in 1868, when the House impeached President Andrew Johnson, who had succeeded President Abraham Lincoln following his assassination at Ford's Theatre. There, the articles approved by the House charged President Johnson with conduct forbidden by law: in firing the Secretary of War, he had allegedly violated the Tenure of Office Act, which restricted the President's power to remove cabinet members during the term of the President who had appointed them.\\96\\ President Johnson was thus accused of a facial abuse of power. In the Senate, though, he was acquitted by a single vote largely because the Tenure of Office Act was viewed by many Senators as likely unconstitutional (a conclusion later adopted by the Supreme Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, who described the Act as ``invalid'' \\97\\). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\96\\ Articles of Impeachment Exhibited By The House Of Representatives Against Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, 40th Cong. (1868). \\97\\ Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 108 (1926). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just over 100 years later, this Committee accused a second chief executive of abusing his power. In a departure from prior Presidential practice--and in contravention of Article I of the Constitution--President Nixon had invoked specious claims of executive privilege to defy Congressional subpoenas served as part of an impeachment inquiry. His obstruction centered on tape recordings, papers, and memoranda relating to the Watergate break-in and its aftermath. As the House Judiciary Committee found, he had interposed ``the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to exercise the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives. \\98\\ Put simply, President Nixon purported to control the exercise of powers that belonged solely to the House and not to him--including the power of inquiry that is vital to any Congressional judgments about impeachment. In so doing, President Nixon injured the constitutional plan: ``Unless the defiance of the Committee's subpoenas under these circumstances is considered grounds for impeachment, it is difficult to conceive of any President acknowledging that he obligated to supply the relevant evidence necessary for Congress to exercise its constitutional responsibility in an impeachment proceeding.'' \\99\\ The House Judiciary Committee therefore approved an article of impeachment against President Nixon for abuse of power in obstructing the House impeachment inquiry. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\98\\ Committee Report on Nixon Articles of Impeachment (1974), at 188. \\99\\ Id., at 213. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- But that was only part of President Nixon's impeachable wrongdoing. The House Judiciary Committee also approved two additional articles of impeachment against him for abuse of power, one for obstruction of justice and the other for using Presidential power to target, harass, and surveil his political opponents. These articles demonstrate the second way in which a President can abuse power: by acting with improper motives. This understanding of impeachable abuse of power is rooted in the Constitution's text, which commands the President to ``faithfully execute'' the law. At minimum, that duty requires Presidents ``to exercise their power only when it is motivated in the public interest rather than in their private self- interest.'' \\100\\ A President can thus be removed for exercising power with a corrupt purpose, even if his action would otherwise be permissible. As Iredell explained at the North Carolina ratifying convention, ``the president would be liable to impeachments [if] he had . . . acted from some corrupt motive or other,'' or if he was ``willfully abusing his trust.'' \\101\\ Madison made a similar point at Virginia's ratifying convention. There, he observed that the President could be impeached for abuse of the pardon power if there are ``grounds to believe'' he has used it to ``shelter'' persons with whom he is connected ``in any suspicious manner.'' \\102\\ Such a pardon would technically be within the President's authority under Article II of the Constitution, but it would rank as an impeachable abuse of power because it arose from the forbidden purpose of obstructing justice. To the Framers, it was dangerous for officials to exceed their constitutional power, or to transgress legal limits, but it was equally dangerous (perhaps more so) for officials to conceal corrupt or illegitimate objectives behind superficially valid acts. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\100\\ Kent et al., Faithful Execution, at 2120, 2179. \\101\\ 1998 Background and History of Impeachment Hearing, at 49. \\102\\ 3 Elliott, Debates in the Several State Conventions, at 497- 98. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Again, President Nixon's case is instructive. After individuals associated with his campaign committee committed crimes to promote his reelection, he used the full powers of his office as part of a scheme to obstruct justice. Among many other wrongful acts, President Nixon dangled pardons to influence key witnesses, told a senior aide to have the CIA stop an FBI investigation into Watergate, meddled with Justice Department immunity decisions, and conveyed secret law enforcement information to suspects. Even if some of this conduct was formally within the scope of President Nixon's authority as head of the Executive Branch, it was undertaken with illegitimate motives. The House Judiciary Committee therefore included it within an article of impeachment charging him with obstruction of justice. Indeed, following President Nixon's resignation and the discovery of additional evidence concerning obstruction, all eleven members of the Committee who had originally voted against that article joined a statement affirming that ``we were prepared to vote for his impeachment on proposed Article I had he not resigned his office.'' \\103\\ Of course, several decades later, obstruction of justice was also the basis for an article of impeachment against President Clinton, though his conduct did not involve official acts.\\104\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\103\\ Committee Report on Nixon Articles of Impeachment (1974), at 361. \\104\\ In President Clinton's case, the House approved the article of impeachment for obstruction of justice. There was virtually no disagreement in those proceedings over whether obstructing justice can be impeachable; scholars, lawyers, and legislators on all sides of the dispute recognized that it can be. See Daniel J. Hemel & Eric A. Posner, Presidential Obstruction of Justice, 106 Cal. L. Rev 1277, 1305-1307 (2018). Publicly available evidence does not suggest that the Senate's acquittal of President Clinton was based on the view that obstruction of justice is not impeachable. Rather, Senators who voted for acquittal appear to have concluded that some of the factual charges were not supported and that, even if Presidential perjury and obstruction of justice might in some cases justify removal, the nature and circumstances of the conduct at issue (including its predominantly private character) rendered it insufficiently grave to warrant that remedy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yet obstruction of justice did not exhaust President Nixon's corrupt abuse of power. He was also accused of manipulating federal agencies to injure his opponents, aid his friends, gain personal political benefits, and violate the constitutional rights of American citizens. For instance, President Nixon improperly attempted to cause income tax audits of his perceived political adversaries; directed the FBI and Secret Service to engage in targeted (and unlawful) surveillance; and formed a secret investigative unit within the White House--financed with campaign contributions--that utilized CIA resources in its illegal covert activities. In explaining this additional article of impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee stated that President Nixon's conduct was ``undertaken for his personal political advantage and not in furtherance of any valid national policy objective.'' \\105\\ His abuses of executive power were thus ``seriously incompatible with our system of constitutional government'' and warranted removal from office.\\106\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\105\\ Committee Report on Nixon Articles of Impeachment (1974), at 139. \\106\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- With the benefit of hindsight, the House's decision to impeach President Johnson is best understood in a similar frame. Scholars now largely agree that President Johnson's impeachment was motivated not by violations of the Tenure of Office Act, but on his illegitimate use of power to undermine Reconstruction and subordinate African-Americans following the Civil War.\\107\\ In that period, fundamental questions about the nature and future of the Union stood unanswered. Congress therefore passed a series of laws to ``reconstruct the former Confederate states into political entities in which black Americans enjoyed constitutional protections.'' \\108\\ This program, however, faced an unyielding enemy in President Johnson, who declared that ``white men alone must manage the south.'' \\109\\ Convinced that political control by African- Americans would cause a ``relapse into barbarism,'' President Johnson vetoed civil rights laws; when Congress overrode him, he refused to enforce those laws.\\110\\ The results were disastrous. As Annette Gordon-Reed writes, ``it would be impossible to exaggerate how devastating it was to have a man who affirmatively hated black people in charge of the program that was designed to settle the terms of their existence in post-Civil War America.'' \\111\\ Congress tried to compromise with the President, but to no avail. A majority of the House finally determined that President Johnson posed a clear and present danger to the Nation if allowed to remain in office. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\107\\ See generally Michael Les Benedict, The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson (1999). \\108\\ Jeffrey A. Engel, Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali, & Peter Baker, Impeachment: An American History 48 (2018). \\109\\ Id. at 49. \\110\\ Id. \\111\\ See Annette Gordon-Reed, Andrew Johnson: The American Presidents Series: the 17th President, 1865-1869 12 (2011). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rather than directly target President Johnson's faithless execution of the laws, and his illegitimate motives in wielding power, the House resorted to charges based on the Tenure of Office Act. But in reality, ``the shaky claims prosecuted by [the House] obscured a far more compelling basis for removal: that Johnson's virulent use of executive power to sabotage Reconstruction posed a mortal threat to the nation--and to civil and political rights--as reconstituted after the Civil War . . . [T]he country was in the throes of a second founding. Yet Johnson abused the powers of his office and violated the Constitution to preserve institutions and practices that had nearly killed the Union. He could not be allowed to salt the earth as the Republic made itself anew.'' \\112\\ Viewed from that perspective, the case for impeaching President Johnson rested on his use of power with illegitimate motives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\112\\ Tribe & Matz, To End a Presidency, at 55. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pulling this all together, the Framers repeatedly confirmed that Presidents can be impeached for grave abuse of power. Where the President engages in acts forbidden by law, or acts with an improper motive, he has committed an abuse of power under the Constitution. Where those abuses inflict substantial harm on our political system and are recognizably wrong, they warrant his impeachment and removal.\\113\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\113\\ In President Clinton's case, it was debated whether Presidents can be impeached for acts that do not involve their official powers. See Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment: Modern Precedents (1998), at 6-7; Minority Staff of H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment: Modern Precedents Minority Views 3-4, 8-9, 13-16 (Comm. Print 1998. Many scholars have taken the view that such private conduct may be impeachable in extraordinary circumstances, such as where it renders the President unviable as the leader of a democratic nation committed to the rule of law. See, e.g., Tribe & Matz, To End A Presidency, at 10, 51; Black & Bobbitt, Impeachment, at 35. It also bears mention that some authority supports the view that Presidents might be subject to impeachment not for abusing their official powers, but by failing to use them and thus engaging in gross dereliction of official duty. See, e.g., Tribe & Matz, To End A Presidency, at 50; Akhil Reed Amar, America's Constitution: A Biography 200 (2006); Black & Bobbitt, Impeachment, at 34. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. BETRAYAL OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST THROUGH FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS It is not a coincidence that the Framers started with ``Treason'' in defining impeachable offenses. Betrayal was no abstraction to them. They had recently waged a war for independence in which some of their fellow citizens remained loyal to the enemy. The infamous traitor, Benedict Arnold, had defected to Britain less than a decade earlier. As they looked outward, the Framers saw kings scheming for power, promising fabulous wealth to spies and deserters. The United States could be enmeshed in such conspiracies: ``Foreign powers,'' warned Elbridge Gerry, ``will intermeddle in our affairs, and spare no expense to influence them.'' \\114\\ The young Republic might not survive a President who schemed with other nations, entangling himself in secret deals that harmed our democracy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\114\\ Wydra & Gorod, The First Magistrate in Foreign Pay. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- That reality loomed over the impeachment debate in Philadelphia. Explaining why the Constitution required an impeachment option, Madison argued that a President ``might betray his trust to foreign powers.'' \\115\\ Gouverneur Morris, who had initially opposed allowing impeachment, was convinced: ``no one would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing the first Magistrate in foreign pay, without being able to guard against it by displacing him.'' \\116\\ In the same vein, Franklin noted ``the case of the Prince of Orange during the late war,'' in which a Dutch prince reneged on a military treaty with France.\\117\\ Because there was no impeachment power or other method of inquiry, the prince's motives were secret and untested, drastically destabilizing Dutch politics and giving ``birth to the most violent animosities and contentions.'' \\118\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\115\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 65. \\116\\ Id., at 68. \\117\\ Id., at 67-68. \\118\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Impeachment for betrayal of the Nation's interest--and especially for betrayal of national security and foreign policy--was hardly exotic to the Framers. ``The history of impeachment over the centuries shows an abiding awareness of how vulnerable the practice of foreign policy is to the misconduct of its makers.'' \\119\\ Indeed, ``impeachments on this ground were a constant of parliamentary practice,'' and ``a string of British ministers and royal advisors were impeached for using their official powers contrary to the country's vital foreign interests.'' \\120\\ Although the Framers did not intend impeachment for genuine, good faith disagreements between the President and Congress over matters of diplomacy, they were explicit that betrayal of the Nation through plots with foreign powers justified removal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\119\\ Frank O. Bowman, III, Foreign Policy Has Always Been at the Heart of Impeachment, Foreign Affairs (Nov 2019). \\120\\ Bowman, High Crimes & Misdemeanors, at 48, 106. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In particular, foreign interference in the American political system was among the gravest dangers feared by the Founders of our Nation and the Framers of our Constitution. For example, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, John Adams wrote: ``You are apprehensive of foreign Interference, Intrigue, Influence. So am I.--But, as often as Elections happen, the danger of foreign Influence recurs.'' \\121\\ And in Federalist No. 68, Hamilton cautioned that the ``most deadly adversaries of republican government'' may come ``chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.\\122\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\121\\ To Thomas Jefferson from John Adams, 6 December 1787, National Archives, Founders Online. \\122\\ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 68, at 441. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The President's important role in foreign affairs does not disable the House from evaluating whether he committed impeachable offenses in that field. This conclusion follows from the Impeachment Clause itself but is also supported by the Constitution's many grants of power to Congress addressing foreign affairs. Congress is empowered to ``declare War,'' ``regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,'' ``establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,'' ``define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations,'' ``grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal,'' and ``make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.'' \\123\\ Congress also has the power to set policy, define law, undertake oversight and investigations, create executive departments, and authorize government funding for a slew of national security matters.\\124\\ In addition, the President cannot make a treaty or appoint an ambassador without the approval of the Senate.\\125\\ In those respects and many others, constitutional authority over the ``conduct of the foreign relations of our Government'' is shared between ``the Executive and Legislative [branches].'' \\126\\ Stated simply, ``the Executive is not free from the ordinary controls and checks of Congress merely because foreign affairs are at issue.'' \\127\\ In these realms, as in many others, the Constitution ``enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity.'' \\128\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\123\\ U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8. \\124\\ See Lawrence Friedman & Victor Hansen, There Is No Constitutional Impediment to an Impeachment Inquiry that Concerns National Security, Just Security, Oct. 1, 2019. \\125\\ U.S. Const., Art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2. \\126\\ Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 511 (2008). \\127\\ Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076 (2015). \\128\\ Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Accordingly, where the President uses his foreign affairs power in ways that betray the national interest for his own benefit, or harm national security for equally corrupt reasons, he is subject to impeachment by the House. Any claims to the contrary would horrify the Framers. A President who perverts his role as chief diplomat to serve private rather than public ends has unquestionably engaged in ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors''--especially if he invited, rather than opposed, foreign interference in our politics. 3. CORRUPTION OF OFFICE OR ELECTIONS As should now be clear, the Framers feared corruption most of all, in its many and shifting manifestations. It was corruption that led to abuse of power and betrayal of the Nation. It was corruption that ruined empires, debased Britain, and menaced American freedom. The Framers saw no shortage of threats to the Republic, and fought valiantly to guard against them, ``but the big fear underlying all the small fears was whether they'd be able to control corruption.'' \\129\\ This was not just a matter of thwarting bribes and extortion; it was a far greater challenge. The Framers aimed to build a country in which officials would not use public power for personal benefits, disregarding the public good in pursuit of their own advancement. This virtuous principle applied with special force to the Presidency. As Madison emphasized, because the Presidency ``was to be administered by a single man,'' his corruption ``might be fatal to the Republic.'' \\130\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\129\\ Teachout, Corruption in America, at 57. \\130\\ Jonathan Elliot ed., Debates on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution in the Convention Held at Philadelphia, in 1787 341 (1861) (hereinafter ``Debates on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Framers therefore sought to ensure that ``corruption was more effectually guarded against, in the manner this government was constituted, than in any other that had ever been formed.'' \\131\\ Impeachment was central to that plan. At one point the Convention even provisionally adopted ``treason, bribery, or corruption'' as the standard for impeaching a President. And no fewer than four delegates--Morris, Madison, Mason, and Randolph--listed corruption as a reason why Presidents must be subject to removal. That understanding followed from history: ``One invariable theme in [centuries] of Anglo-American impeachment practice has been corruption.'' \\132\\ Treason posed a threat of swift national extinction, but the steady rot of corruption could destroy us from within. Presidents who succumbed to that instinct, serving themselves at the Nation's expense, forfeited the public trust. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\131\\ 4 Elliot, Debates in the Several State Conventions, at 302. \\132\\ Bowman, High Crimes & Misdemeanors, at 277. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Impeachment was seen as especially necessary for Presidential conduct corrupting our system of political self- government. That concern arose in two contexts: the risk that Presidents would be swayed to prioritize foreign over domestic interests, and the risk that they would place their personal interest in re-election above our abiding commitment to democracy. The need for impeachment peaks where both threats converge at once. First was the risk that foreign royals would use wealth, power, and titles to seduce American officials. This was not a hypothetical problem. Just a few years earlier, and consistent with European custom, King Louis XVI of France had bestowed on Benjamin Franklin (in his capacity as American emissary) a snuff box decorated with 408 diamonds ``of a beautiful water.'' \\133\\ Magnificent gifts like this one could unconsciously shape how American officials carried out their duties. To guard against that peril, the Framers adopted the Foreign Emoluments Clause, which prohibits Presidents--among other federal officials--from accepting ``any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State'' unless Congress affirmatively consents.\\134\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\133\\ Teachout, Corruption in America, at 1. \\134\\ U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 9, cl. 8. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The theory of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, based in history and the Framers' lived experience, ``is that a federal officeholder who receives something of value from a foreign power can be imperceptibly induced to compromise what the Constitution insists be his exclusive loyalty: the best interest of the United States of America.'' \\135\\ Rather than scrutinize every exchange for potential bribery, the Framers simply banned officials from receiving anything of value from foreign powers. Although this rule sweeps broadly, the Framers deemed it central to American self-governance. Speaking in Philadelphia, Charles Pinckney ``urged the necessity of preserving foreign ministers, and other officers of the United States, independent of external influence.'' \\136\\ At Virginia's convention, Randolph elaborated that ``[i]t was thought proper, in order to exclude corruption and foreign influence, to prohibit any one in office from receiving or holding any emoluments from foreign states.'' \\137\\ Randolph added that if the President violated the Clause, ``he may be impeached.'' \\138\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\135\\ Norman L. Eisen, Richard Painter & Laurence H. Tribe, The Emoluments Clause: Its Text, Meaning, And Application To Donald J. Trump, Brookings, Dec. 16, 2016. \\136\\ Elliot, Debates on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution at 467. \\137\\ 3 Elliot, Debates in the Several State Conventions, at 465. \\138\\ Id., at 201. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Framers also anticipated impeachment if a President placed his own interest in retaining power above the national interest in free and fair elections. Several delegates were explicit on this point when the topic arose at the Constitutional Convention. By then, the Framers had created the Electoral College. They were ``satisfied with it as a tool for picking presidents but feared that individual electors might be intimidated or corrupted.'' \\139\\ Impeachment was their answer. William Davie led off the discussion, warning that a President who abused his office might seek to escape accountability by interfering with elections, sparing ``no efforts or means whatever to get himself re-elected.'' \\140\\ Rendering the President ``impeachable whilst in office'' was thus ``an essential security for the good behaviour of the Executive.'' \\141\\ The Constitution thereby ensured that corrupt Presidents could not avoid justice by subverting elections and remaining in office. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\139\\ Tribe & Matz, To End A Presidency, at 4. \\140\\ 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, at 64. \\141\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- George Mason built on Davie's position, directing attention to the Electoral College: ``One objection agst. Electors was the danger of their being corrupted by the Candidates; & this furnished a peculiar reason in favor of impeachments whilst in office. Shall the man who has practised corruption & by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?'' \\142\\ Mason's concern was straightforward. He feared that Presidents would win election by improperly influencing members of the Electoral College (e.g., by offering them bribes). If evidence of such wrongdoing came to light, it would be unthinkable to leave the President in office--especially given that he might seek to avoid punishment by corrupting the next election. In that circumstance, Mason concluded, the President should face impeachment and removal under the Constitution. Notably, Mason was not alone in this view. Speaking just a short while later, Gouverneur Morris emphatically agreed that ``the Executive ought therefore to be impeachable for . . . Corrupting his electors.'' \\143\\ Although not articulated expressly, it is reasonable to infer that the concerns raised by Davie, Mason, and Morris were especially salient because the Constitution-- until ratification of the Twenty-Second Amendment in 1951--did not limit the number of terms a President could serve in office.\\144\\ A President who twisted or sabotaged the electoral process could rule for life, much like a king. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\142\\ Id., at 65. \\143\\ Id., at 69. \\144\\ U.S. Const. Amend. XXII. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This commitment to impeaching Presidents who corruptly interfered with elections was anchored in lessons from British rule. As historian Gordon Wood writes, ``[t]hroughout the eighteenth century the Crown had slyly avoided the blunt and clumsy instrument of prerogative, and instead had resorted to influencing the electoral process and the representatives in Parliament in order to gain its treacherous ends.'' \\145\\ In his influential Second Treatise on Civil Government, John Locke blasted such manipulation, warning that it serves to ``cut up the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public security.'' \\146\\ Channeling Locke, American revolutionaries vehemently objected to King George III's electoral shenanigans; ultimately, they listed several election-related charges in the Declaration of Independence. Those who wrote our Constitution knew, and feared, that the chief executive could threaten their plan of government by corrupting elections. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\145\\ Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, at 33. \\146\\ John Locke, Second Treatise of Government 112 (C.B. Macpherson ed. 1980). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The true nature of this threat is its rejection of government by ``We the People,'' who would ``ordain and establish'' the Constitution.\\147\\ The beating heart of the Framers' project was a commitment to popular sovereignty. At a time when ``democratic self- government existed almost nowhere on earth,'' \\148\\ the Framers imagined a society ``where the true principles of representation are understood and practised, and where all authority flows from, and returns at stated periods to, the people.'' \\149\\ That would be possible only if ``those entrusted with [power] should be kept in dependence on the people.'' \\150\\ This is why the President, and Members of Congress, must stand before the public for re-election on fixed terms. It is through free and fair elections that the American people protect their right to self-government, a right unforgivably denied to many as the Constitution was ratified in 1788 but now extended to all American citizens over the age of 18. When the President concludes that elections threaten his continued grasp on power, and therefore seeks to corrupt or interfere with them, he denies the very premise of our constitutional system.
