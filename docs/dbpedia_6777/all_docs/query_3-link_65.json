        "text": "Amends Constitution\n\nStandardizes voting eligibility for school board elections with other state and local elections.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote deletes enforceable provisions relating to voter eligibility; deletion would have no substantive effect.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains unenforceable provisions that require citizens to be 21 years of age to vote in school board elections.\n\nSummary\n\nAmends Oregon Constitution. The Oregon Constitution requires voters in school district elections to be 21 years of age and residents in the school district for six months. It also requires voters to pass a literacy test to vote in school district elections. This measure would eliminate these school district voter eligibility requirements because they are unenforceable under the United States Constitution and federal law. Voters in school district elections would still have to satisfy all other voter eligibility requirements for local, state, and federal elections in Oregon. This measure would \"clean up\" the Oregon Constitution by deleting outdated and unenforceable language.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThere is no direct financial effect on state or local government expenditures or revenue.\n\nAmends Constitution\n\nChanges operative date of redistricting plans; allows affected legislators to finish term in the original district.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote changes the date when new redistricting plans become law, which allows affected state Representatives and Senators to represent their districts for a full term.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current law permitting state legislators to be reassigned to another district when redistricting plan results in multiple legislators living in one district.\n\nSummary\n\nAmends Oregon Constitution. Reapportionment, commonly called \"redistricting \" in Oregon, changes the line of Oregon's state Representative and state Senator districts every 10 years, based on results of the U.S. census. The next census is scheduled for 2010, with redistricting to be done in 2011. Currently, when a redistricting plan takes effect, and more than one Representative or Senator resides in the new district, one of the Representatives or Senators is assigned, temporarily, to another district. For example, in 2001 a Eugene Representative was assigned to represent a district in central Oregon. This measure would allow Representatives and Senators to continue to represent the district from which they were elected for their full terms, with the new redistricting going into effect after the next general election.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThere is no direct financial effect on state or local government expenditures or revenue.\n\nAmends Constitution\n\nProvides that May and November property tax elections are decided by the majority of voters voting.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote provides that the majority of voters voting in the May and November elections may pass local property tax measures to fund schools, police, and local services.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current law where non-votes have the effect of \"no\" vote in certain local elections where less than 50% of voters participate.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrent law requires that 50% of voters participate in an election (except general elections in even-numbered years) in order to pass local property tax measures to raise money for schools, police, libraries, parks, or other local government services. This means that non-votes have the effect of a \"no\" vote where less than 50% of qualified voters participate. All other elections are determined by a majority of those who vote, with no voter turnout requirements. This measure eliminates the voter turnout requirement for local property tax elections held in May and November. As a result, for such elections, measures to raise money for schools, police, libraries, parks, or other local government services become law when approved by a majority of those voting.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThere is no direct financial effect on local government expenditures or revenue.\n\nDescription\n\nIncreases sentences for drug trafficking, theft against the elderly, and specified repeat property and identity theft crimes; requires addiction treatment for certain offenders.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote increases sentences for drug trafficking (methamphetamine, heroin, \"ecstasy,\" and cocaine), theft against the elderly, and specified repeat property and identity theft crimes; requires addiction treatment for certain offenders; establishes this measure as an alternative to other specified measure on this ballot to impose minimum sentences for listed crimes.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current laws, which provide lesser sentences for specified crimes and do not require treatment for addicted offenders.\n\nSummary\n\nThis measure increases prison sentences for specified drug and property crimes as follows:\n\nTrafficking of methamphetamine, heroin, \"ecstasy,\" or cocaine: 34 to 130 months depending on the quantity of drugs and criminal history.\n\nAggravated theft of over $10,000 where the victim is elderly: 16 to 45 months, depending on criminal history.\n\nRepeat offenses of identity theft, burglary, theft, robbery, mail theft, art theft, forgery, criminal mischief, credit card, and check fraud: 18 to 30 months or 24 to 36 months, depending on the seriousness of the crime and number of past convictions.\n\nThis measure also requires treatment for certain addicted offenders at risk of reoffending; imposes sanctions on those who refuse treatment. Limits the court's ability to reduce sentences. Provides grants to counties for the operation of local jails, treatment services, intensive supervision, and drug courts.\n\nIf this measure passes with more votes than other specified measures on this ballot to impose minimum sentences for listed crimes, this measure control and other measures will have no effect. If this measure passes with fewer votes than other specified measures on this ballot to impose minimum sentences for listed crimes, this measure will have no effect. See Explanatory Statement for more information\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThe measure will require additional state spending of approximately $9 million in the first year, $74 million in the second year, $79 million in the third year, $106 million in the fourth year, and more than $143 million each year after that. The measure does not require additional local government spending.\n\nThe state will borrow $314 million from 2010 to 2017 to build new prison space. The state will repay those amounts plus interest of $203 million over 25 years.\n\nThe measure does not affect the amount of funds collected for state government\n\nDescription\n\nProhibits teaching public school students in a language other than English for more than two years.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote prohibits teaching public school students in a language other than English for more than two years (except for teaching a foreign language to English speakers).\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains requiring English courses for students unable to profit from classes taught in English, permitting multiple-language instruction to assist the transition to English.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrent law requires instruction in all school subjects (except foreign language) to be primarily in English; permits instruction in more than one language so students whose native language is not English can make an early transition to English; requires schools to provide English courses for children unable to profit from classes taught in English. The measure provides that no public school student shall be taught in a language other than English for more than two years, with the exception of classes teaching a foreign language to English-speaking students. Limits \"English immersion classes\" (not defined) to no more than two years for students whose primary language is not English and who are not capable of being taught in English; after that, students shall be taught exclusively in English. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThis measure will require additional local school spending between $203 million and $253 million in each of the first two school years. The cost may change in later years, depending upon the number of non-English speaking students in public schools, and their academic performance over time.\n\nThe measure does not affect the amount of funds collected for state government, schools, or local governments.\n\nDescription\n\nCreates an unlimited deduction for federal income taxes on individual taxpayers' Oregon income-tax returns.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote creates an unlimited deduction for federal income taxes on Oregon income-tax returns filed by individual taxpayers; reduces revenue available for state expenditures.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current law, which allows a limited deduction for federal income taxes on individual taxpayers' Oregon income-tax returns (the limit generally is $5,500).\n\nSummary\n\nUnder current law, personal income taxpayers may deduct a limited amount of federal income taxes when calculating their Oregon taxable income (the limit generally is $5,500; the limit is adjusted yearly for cost-of-living starting in 2008). This measure creates an unlimited deduction for federal income taxes on individual taxpayers' Oregon returns beginning in 2010. Provides \"no Oregon taxpayer shall be required to pay to the state, a local government, or other taxing district, an income tax of any kind on money paid to the federal government as federal income taxes.\" The deduction applies only to federal income taxes paid on income taxed in Oregon; does not apply to corporate excise/income taxes. Reduces revenue available for state expenditures; provides no replacement funding. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThis measure will reduce state budget revenues by approximately $360 million in the first year, $1.0 billion in the second year, and $1.2 billion per year after that depending upon growth in personal income and federal tax liability.\n\nThe measure may result in a reduction of state-shared revenues to schools and local governments. The measure may result in a reduction of federal revenue sharing to the state government.\n\nDescription\n\nTeacher \"classroom performance,\" not seniority, determines pay raises, and \"most qualified\" teachers are retained, regardless of seniority.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote makes teacher pay raises dependent on \"classroom performance,\" without regard to seniority; specific subject training, and reaching performance determine retention if lay-offs occur.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current laws allowing local school boards to pay and retain teachers by qualifications, including teaching competence, experience, educational attainments, licensure, and seniority.\n\nSummary\n\nLocal public school district boards currently fix salaries, retention, and other contract terms of employment for teachers within their respective districts, subject to state laws regarding collective bargaining, merit, competence, licensure, and the Accountably for Schools for the 21st Century Law. The measure eliminates seniority as a criterion for pay raises and requires that pay raises for teachers be based solely on that teacher's \"classroom performance\" (undefined); provides that if a school district reduces teaching staff, the district must retain the \"most qualified\" teacher, identified by \"past classroom experience successfully teaching the specified subject\" and academic training in that subject. Measure supersedes and conflicts with law or policy, but applies only to the teacher contract extension and new contracts made after the effective date of measure. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThe measure will require between $30 million and $72 million in additional state and local spending in the first school year. Thereafter the measure will require between $30 million and $60 million in additional state and local spending each year.\n\nThis measure does not affect the amount of funds collected for state government, schools, or local governments.\n\nDescription\n\nCreates mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain theft, identity theft, forgery, drug, and burglary crimes.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote creates mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain crimes, including burglary, forgery, theft, and manufacture/delivery of methamphetamine, under specified circumstances.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current law, which does not require that persons convicted of the crimes specified in the measure serve mandatory minimum prison sentences.\n\nSummary\n\nThe measure creates mandatory minimum prison sentences for specified crimes for which current law does not require mandatory minimum. Requires 36-month minimums for identity theft, first-degree burglary, and Class A felony manufacture/delivery of methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, or methylene-dioxymethamphetamine; 30-month minimums for Class B felony manufacture/delivery of same specified controlled substances. For offenders with one or more prior felony convictions, or two or more prior misdemeanor convictions, the measure requires 18-month minimums for first-degree forgery, motor vehicle theft; 14-month minimums for first-degree theft, and second-degree burglary. Prohibits reductions in sentences required by the measure. Sentences must be served in state prisons, not in county jails. The state must reimburse counties for pretrial incarceration costs for persons sentences under the measure. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThis measure will require additional state spending of $8 million to $10 million in the first year. $67 million to $88 million in the second year, $122 million to $178 million in the third year, $164 million to $247 million in the fourth year, and $161 million to $274 million in each year after that. The measure does not require additional local government spending.\n\nThis measure will require the state to borrow between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion to build new prisons between 2010 and 2017. The state will repay those amounts plus interest of $709 million to $844 million over 25 years. The measure requires state payment to the local government of $2 million to $5 million in the first year and $10 million to $19 million each year after that.\n\nThe measure does not affect the amount of funds collected by the state government.\n\nDescription\n\nAllocates 15% of lottery proceeds to public safety funds for crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote amends the constitution to allocate 15% of lottery proceeds to public safety funds, reducing the percentage of funds available for other lottery-funded programs.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains the current list of authorized purposes for spending lottery proceeds; rejects amending the constitution to allocate a specific percentage of proceeds for public safety.\n\nSummary\n\nAmends constitution. The constitution currently apportions lottery proceeds to create jobs, further economic development, and finance public education. In addition to those uses, the measure requires 15% of net lottery proceeds deposited in the public safety funds. 50% of fund moneys are distributed to counties for grants for the following; 20% for early childhood programs for at-risk children; 15% to supplement district attorney operations; 15% to county sheriffs' investigation, and field operations. Allocates grants to the county under formula; 30% divided equally on a per-country basis, 70% divided on a population basis. Measure dedicates 50% of proceeds to state police criminal investigation and forensic operations. The measure prohibits the legislature from limiting expenditures from funds. Funds to prosecution and sheriffs are not substituted for existing funds. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nIt is estimated that the measure would require public safety spending of $100 million of state lottery revenues in the first year, $106 million in the second year, $113 million in the third year, and $120 million in the fourth year. Spending from that fund would be evenly split between state and local public safety expenditures.\n\nThe new required spending of lottery revenues for the public safety fund would reduce lottery funds available to spend for education and for state and local economic development.\n\nDescription\n\nExempts specified property owners from building permit requirements for improvements valued at/under $35,000.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote exempts farm and residential real property owners from applicable state and local building permit requirements for improvements valued at 35,000 or less.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote requires farm and residential real property owners to comply with applicable state/local building permit requirements for improvements valued at/under 35,000 dollars.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrent law requires the owner of residential real property or farm property to comply with applicable state and local building permit requirements when making improvements to real property. The measure creates an exemption for residential real property and farm owners from applicable state and local building permit requirements for improvements when the total value of improvements made within a calendar year does not exceed $35,000. The measure requires improvements to comply with applicable setback requirements and height limitations. Requires property owners to disclose improvements made without building permits to prospective buyers. Requires electrical wiring made to improvement covered by measure to be performed or approved by the licensed electrical contractor. Amount of exemptions increases annually to adjust for inflation. Measure supersedes conflicting state and local laws. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThis measure will reduce local government revenue by between $4 million and $8 million each year. The measure will reduce state government revenue between $450,000 and $750,000 each year.\n\nThe measure will reduce local government spending between $4 million and $8 million each year. The measure has no effect on state government spending.\n\nDescription\n\nPenalizes a person, or entity for using funds collected with \"public resource\" (defined) for \"political purpose\" (defined).\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote prohibits persons, or entities from using the money for \"political purpose\" (defined) if collected with \"public resource\" (defined), commingled with such money, and mandates penalties.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains current law, which does not restrict a person's or entity's use of money collected with public resources or commingling such money with \"political\" funds.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrent law allows individuals and organizations to use money for \"political purposes,\" including money collected with public resources. The measure prohibits individuals, organizations, and other entities from using money for \"political purposes\" if \"public resources\" were used in collecting it. \"Money\" includes in-kind contributions, independent expenditures, and pass-through contributions. \"Public resources\" include money, public employee work time, buildings, equipment, and supplies, unless used for conducting elections, or issuing official voters' pamphlets. \"Used for a political purpose\" means: contributed to a candidate, political committee, political party, initiative/referendum committee; spent supporting, opposing candidate, ballot measure, gathering signatures for the proposed measure, petition; excludes lobbying and elected official. Mandates civil penalty, bars the government from collecting money for an entity that uses such money for \"political purposes\" or commingles it with \"political\" money. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThis measure requires additional state government, schools, or local government spending of less than $100,000.\n\nThe measure does not affect the amount of funds collected for state government, schools, or local governments.\n\nDescription\n\nChanges in general election nomination processes for major/minor parties, independent candidates for most partisan offices.\n\nResult of \"Yes\" Vote\n\nThe \"Yes\" vote changes general election nomination processes for most partisan offices; all candidates run in the single primary; the top two primary candidates compete in the general election.\n\nResult of \"No\" Vote\n\nThe \"No\" vote retains the current party primary election system and retains procedures for the nomination of a minor political party and independent candidates to the general election.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrently, major parties nominate candidates for the general election through party primaries; minor parties, independent nominate candidates directly to the general election. Multiple candidates for office may appear on the general election ballot. Measure changes those nomination processes for most partisan offices, including United States Senator; Congressional Representative; Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer; Attorney General; State Senator; State Representative; any state, county, city, or district office that is not nonpartisan/for which law authorizes political party nominations to the general election. Primary ballots contain all prospective candidates; the elector may vote for a candidate regardless of the elector candidate's party affiliation. Only the top two candidates in the primary compete in the general election. Primary and general election ballots must contain candidates' party registration and endorsements. An eligible person, regardless of party affiliation, may fill the vacancy. Other provisions.\n\nEstimate of Financial Impact\n\nThe measure requires one-time spending by both state and local governments of approximately $100,000 total for computer programming changes.\n\nThe measure requires approximately $100,000 every two years in additional state government spending for the primary election voter's pamphlet.\n\nThe measure requires approximately $227,000 every two years in additional local government spending for primary ballot printing and postage.\n\nThe measure does not affect the amount of funds collected for state or local government.\n\nThe measure does not affect the amount of funds collected for state or local government.\n\nLincoln County Library District\n\nLocal Option Tax for Library Funding.\n\nQuestion\n\nShall Lincoln County Library District levy 9¢ per $1,000 assessed value for five years, beginning 2010 to 2011, to fund your library?\n\nThis measure may cause property taxes to increase by more than 3%.\n\nSummary\n\nThis measure will replace the expiring local option tax. Approval of this measure continues providing funding at its present level for the Lincoln County Library District and the funding it provides to libraries in Lincoln City, Newport, Siletz, Toledo, and Waldport.\n\nIt is estimated that this measure would raise approximately $311,601 in tax revenues for 2010 to 2011, $320,950 in tax revenues for 2011 to 2012, $330,578 in tax revenues for 2012 to 2013, $340,495 in tax revenues for 2013 to 2014, and $350,710 in tax revenues for 2014 to 2015. The estimated tax cost for this measure is an estimate only based on the best information available from the county assessor at the time of estimate.\n\nCity of Newport\n\nGeneral Obligation Bonds for Water System Improvements.\n\nQuestion\n\nShall Newport issue up to $15,900,000 of general obligation bonds to pay for water system improvements? If the bonds are approved, they will be payable from taxes on property or property ownership that are not subject to the limits of sections 11 and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.\n\nSummary\n\nIf this measure is approved, the city could issue up to $15.9 million of general obligation bonds to pay for a new water treatment plant, new intake pipelines for the water treatment plant, and a new treated water reservoir.\n\nThe new water treatment plant would be more efficient and have a less environmental impact than the existing plant. it would have more redundancy in case of system failure. The new plant would substantially increase production capacity.\n\nThe city currently has general obligation bonds outstanding that are expected to be paid off in 10 years. Because the tax rate on those bonds is declining, the city expects to be able to structure the new bonds so that the total tax rate for all city general obligation bonds is about the same as the city bond tax rate for the November 2007 levy. The new bonds, if approved, would mature in 21 years.\n\nCity of Depoe Bay\n\nLocal Option Tax Levy Authorization for Law Enforcement.\n\nQuestion\n\nShall the City be authorized to levy a local option tax of 32¢/$1,000 valuation for five years commencing in 2009 to 2010?\n\nThis measure may cause property taxes to increase by more than 3%.\n\nSummary\n\nThis measure authorizes the City to levy a property tax at a rate of 32¢ per thousand dollars assessed valuation each year commencing the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009, for five consecutive years. The taxes would be used, in conjunction with dedicated transient room tax revenues, to finance the City Public Safety and Law Enforcement Program including a contract with the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department for services equivalent to the one full-time deputy sheriff, an office with furnishings and office equipment, administrative support and to pay related costs. The estimated tax cost for this measure is an estimate only based on the best information available from the county assessor at the time of the estimate. The City estimates that this measure would raise approximately $106,810 in tax revenues from 2009 to 2010, $104,271 in 2010 to 2011, $102,196 in tax revenues from 2011 to 2012, $102,942 from 2012 to 2013, and $106,286 from 2013 to 2014.\n\nPort of Alsea\n\nPort of Alsea General Obligation Bond Authorization.\n\nQuestion\n\nShall the Port of Alsea be authorized to issue general obligation bonds not exceeding $775,000? If the bonds are approved, they will be payable from taxes on property or property ownership that are not subject to the limits of sections 11 and 11b. Article XI of the Oregon Constitution\n\nSummary\n\nThe passage of this measure would provide funds for capital construction and improvements and bond costs.\n\nThe passage of this measure will finance the construction of a building that is expected to store a water rescue vessel and related equipment. The Port provides primary access to Alsea Bay for search and rescue personnel from Central Oregon Coast Fire and Rescue District. Seal Rock Rural Fire Protection District and Yachats Rural Fire Protection District also respond to water emergencies on Alsea Bay. Currently, the water rescue vessel and equipment are stored approximately half a mile away from the Port at the fire hall. It is expected that the storage of the vessel and equipment close to the Port launch ramp would help reduce response times to emergency incidents.\n\nThe proposed building may also include office space for the Port and residential space.\n\nThe bonds may be issued in one or more series and each series will mature in 16 years or less from the date of issue.\n\nYachats Rural Fire Protection District\n\nRenewal of Local Option Tax For the Yachats Fire District.\n\nQuestion\n\nShall Yachats Fire District renew its tax of 61¢ per $1000 assessed value for an additional five years beginning 2009 to 2010?\n\nThis measure may cause property taxes to increase by more than 3%.\n\nSummary\n\nApproval of this measure would renew the current five-year local option tax set to expire in the tax year 2009 to 2010, at the same rate now in effect, for an additional five years.\n\nIt is estimated that this measure would raise approximately $247,437 in tax revenues for 2009 to 2010, $254,860 in tax revenues for 2010 to 2011, $262,506 in tax revenues for 2011 to 2012, $270,381 in tax revenues for 2012 to 2013, and $278,493 in tax revenues for 2013 to 2014.\n\nRevenues would be used by the Yachats Rural Fire Protection District to continue Emergency Medical Services, replace older vehicles, continue expanding training, and purchase hoses and small equipment.\n\nSeal Rock Rural Fire Protection District\n\nFive-Year Local Option Tax for Seal Rock Rural Fire Protection District (RFPD).\n\nQuestion\n\nShall the District levy a local option tax of $.20 per $1,000 of assessed value for five years beginning 2009 to 2010?\n\nThis measure may cause property taxes to increase by more than 3%.\n\nSummary\n\nApproval of this measure would allow the District to hire a full-time fire chief and pay expenses related to that position.\n\nPresently the District has no full-time personnel. The chief's position is part-time. Growth within the District and increased governmental regulations have increased the time required to oversee District equipment, and personnel and to maintain compliance with governmental regulations.\n\nA full-time chief would be responsible for effectively managing the District and its assets, training volunteer firefighters, and completing governmental reports and filings, and have other such responsibilities as designated by the Board of the District.\n\nThe proposed rate will raise approximately $75,417 from 2009 to 2010; $77,680 from 2010 to 2011; $79,992 from 2011 to 2012; $82.392 from 2012 to 2013; $84,863 from 2013 to 2014. The estimated cost for this measure is an estimate only based on the best information available from the county assessor at the time of the estimate.\n\nPort of Toledo\n\nPort of Toledo, Oregon General Obligation Bond Authorization.\n\nQuestion\n\nShall the Port of Toledo be authorized to issue general obligation bonds not exceeding $3,060,000? If the bonds are approved, they will be payable from taxes on property or property ownership that are not subject to the limits of sections 11 and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.\n\nSummary\n\nIf approved, this measure provides funds to finance capital construction and improvements and pay bond costs. Specifically, this measure is expected to finance:\n\nAcquire Toledo boatyard, properties, and equipment.\n\nFacility Improvements, including boat wash-down systems, work areas, access, and paving.\n\nEnvironmental, regulatory, and engineering work related to the Toledo boatyard project including marine rail facilities.\n\nInstall an on-site stormwater facility and a sanitary sewer system.\n\nUpgrade sandblasting and spray painting areas.\n\nUpgrade dry dock, pier, and floating docks.\n\nRelated site improvements, furnishing, and equipping.\n\nPay fees associated with issuing the bonds.\n\nThe bonds would mature in twenty-one years or less from the date of issuance and may be issued in one or more series. The estimated average annual cost of this bond is $0.30 per $1000 of assessed value. The owner of a home assessed at $100,000 is estimated to pay $30 a year."
