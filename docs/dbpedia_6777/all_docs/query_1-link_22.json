        "text": "By Liz Flynn - bio | email\n\nSAVANNAH, GA (WTOC) - Much of the focus of the presidential campaign has been on Barack Obama and John McCain. But they're not the only ones on the ballot.\n\nIn this election, four third party candidates are also running for president, including former US Rep. Bob Barr from Georgia, the Libertarian Party candidate.\n\nBarr has spent the last month campaigning in key battleground states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Iowa. He said he's focusing the last days of his campaign in his home state of Georgia, where he represented the state's 7th district in the US House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003.\n\nRealistically, he told WTOC he will probably not win the presidential election. Still, he thinks he can make an impact on whoever does win.\n\n\"What we hope to have happen is for me to get a sufficiently large percentage of the popular vote tomorrow so that the two major parties, in particular whichever one wins in the election, cannot ignore what the Libertarian party stands for: which is smaller government, tax reform and more individual freedom,\" explained Barr.\n\nBarr said those ideas separate him from his opponents. He said, unlike Obama and McCain, he does not support the government bailout on Wall Street. Instead, he favors letting the market correct itself.\n\n\"Let private industry sort itself out, which it honestly had already started to do before the government stepped in,\" he said. \"Wells Fargo was already looking at purchasing and did purchase Wachovia. Warren Buffett had put billions of dollars into shoring up Goldman Sachs. The market was already starting to operate.\"\n\nBarr felt the one thing government should be doing, that it was not, is prosecuting fraud.\n\n\"There appears to be massive fraud in the housing market and financial and insurance institutions, yet the government isn't doing the one thing it's equipped to do and that is to prosecute those cases to make sure the market place operates honestly and with transparency,\" he said.\n\nTo see the full interview, click on video link."
