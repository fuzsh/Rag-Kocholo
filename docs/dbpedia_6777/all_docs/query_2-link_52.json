        "text": "CHICAGO â€” The Green Party, which captured less than 1 percent of the vote in the last U.S. presidential election, has chosen the former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney as its 2008 presidential candidate.\n\nMcKinney, 53, will be joined on the ticket for the election in November by vice presidential candidate Rosa Clemente, a hip-hop artist and activist.\n\nMcKinney received 313 out of 532 votes cast Saturday at the party's nominating convention in Chicago, Scott McLarty, a spokesman for the party, said.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, the Green Party drew 119,859 votes, or 0.1 percent of the total votes cast, finishing in sixth place behind the two major parties and three other third-party tickets.\n\nThe party's best performance came in 2000 when Ralph Nader led the ticket and won 2.8 million votes, or 2.7 percent of the total. Some political analysts say Nader, a political and consumer activist, may have drawn votes from the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, and helped tip the election in favor of George W. Bush.\n\nNader is running for president again this year, as an independent candidate.\n\nMcKinney served six terms in Congress but lost her bid for re-election in 2006. She was the first black woman to represent Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAnother former House member from Georgia, Bob Barr, who served as a Republican, is running as the Libertarian Party candidate for president. The major-party presumptive candidates are Senator Barack Obama of the Democratic Party and Senator John McCain of the Republican Party.\n\nThe U.S. Green Party says it is a partner with the European Federation of Green Parties and the Federation of Green Parties of the Americas.\n\n\"Green parties are the first parties to recognize that our role in the world is stewardship of Earth's natural resources rather than domination and unrestrained consumption of the goods of the Earth,\" the party said in its proposed platform for the 2008 election."
