        "text": "Who is running?\n\nDemocratic senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Republican senator John McCain of Arizona are the major party candidates. Their vice-presidential running mates are Delaware senator Joe Biden and Alaska governor Sarah Palin, respectively.\n\nAlso running are Ralph Nader, the liberal consumer advocate whom Democrats blame with spoiling the 2000 election by siphoning votes from Al Gore and Cynthia McKinney, a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia who is running on the Green party ticket. Former Georgia Republican congressman Georgia Bob Barr is running on the Libertarian ticket, hoping in part to win over conservative gadfly Ron Paul's backers.\n\nHow were Barack Obama and John McCain chosen as their parties' nominees?\n\nThey were nominated by a vote of delegates to their respective national conventions in the late summer. They earned the support of those delegates by winning the long series of primary caucuses and elections held in the winter and spring. The Democratic nomination also need to be secured by the allegiance of party insiders and elected officials known as \"superdelegates\". So whoever gets the most votes on November 4 wins?\n\nNo. US presidential elections are awarded to the winner of what is known as the electoral college. Under the system, each state is allocated anywhere from three to 55 votes according to its population.\n\nThe winner of the popular vote wins a state's electoral votes - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by district. The candidate that wins 270 electoral votes takes the White House.\n\nWhat happens if the winner of the electoral college has tallied fewer popular votes?\n\nThis has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000. Under the US Constitution, the presidency nevertheless goes to the candidate who wins the electoral college.\n\nWhat are the most important states?\n\nCalifornia, New York and Texas offer the most electoral votes, with 55, 31 and 34 respectively. But those mammoth lodes are not up for grabs: the first two states are safely Democrat, and Texas has voted Republican every year since 1976. The candidates typically spend most of their time in a handful of large \"swing states\" that could vote either way, including Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen do Americans vote?\n\nElection day is November 4, but many states allow voters to cast a ballot before then. Why vote early?\n\nVoters like early voting because it adds convenience and precludes having to wait on a long queue at the polls. This year, the Obama campaign is encouraging supporters to vote early to mitigate the chances of a late McCain surge in momentum. Research shows early voting does not dramatically increase turnout, as early voters would have cast a ballot on election day anyway. How many Americans vote?\n\nUS citizens must be at least 18 years old and be registered with their local elections supervisor in order to vote. In 2004, 64% of voting-age citizens cast a ballot, up from 60% in 2000. This year Americans are expected to vote in record numbers, in large part because Obama has energised young voters and African-Americans in unprecedented levels.\n\nWhat is the vice-president's role in the campaign?\n\nVice-presidents run alongside presidential candidates on the party ticket. They have few official governing duties under the Constitution, and it is often joked that the most important day in a vice-president's career is the day he (or she) is brought onto the campaign. During the campaign, vice-presidential running mates are often tasked with attacking the record and character of the opposing presidential candidate, and this year Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin have embraced that role. What does the president actually do?\n\nThe president is commander in chief of the US military, sets foreign policy and negotiates treaties, oversees dozens of executive agencies and departments, signs bills into law and submits a budget to the US Congress.\n\nThe president also appoints federal judges including new US supreme court justices. From the White House \"bully pulpit\", the president can wield extraordinary influence over legislation.\n\nWho can run for president?\n\nThe Constitution states only that the president must be a \"natural born citizen\", at least 35 years old and have resided in the US for 14 years. John McCain was born in the Panama Canal zone. Is he a \"natural born citizen\"?\n\nThe term has been widely interpreted to mean people born in the US, although the Constitution does not define it.\n\nPoliticians in Washington are in broad agreement, however that McCain is a natural born citizen because he was born on a US military base in a US territory and his father was in the US navy. The Senate in May passed a resolution affirming that McCain is eligible to be president.\n\nMy friend in America wants to run for president. How does he go about doing this?\n\nIt is very, very difficult to run for the highest office in the nation. With the noteworthy exception of Barack Obama, serious presidential contenders have typically spent decades positioning themselves for a White House run, building political support by winning lower office, campaigning for other candidates, assembling coalitions of supporters and financiers, and mapping an electoral college strategy.\n\nPresidents and major-party nominees often fail their first attempt. Richard Nixon lost to John Kennedy in 1960 and spent the next eight years out of office, plotting his return to power in 1968. John McCain sought the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost to George Bush. He soon began positioning himself for this race.\n\nHow did Barack Obama manage to put himself in contention after less than three years in the Senate and eight years in the Illinois legislature?\n\nObama first gained national attention in 2004 as a candidate for Senate in Illinois. He made a well-received speech at the Democratic convention that year, and struck party faithful with his charisma and his call for an end to divisive partisan and racial politics.\n\nBut his relative lack of experience was a top issue for his opponents for the Democratic nomination.\n\nRunning for president sounds expensive. How much have the candidates spent so far?\n\nUp until the end of August, McCain and the Republican party had spent $197.4m on the campaign. Obama and the Democrats had spent $391.4m.\n\nHow do they raise so much money?\n\nAn individual may donate only $2,300 per election to a presidential candidate, so the campaigns rely on \"bundlers\" - well-heeled and influential people who can gather checks from large numbers of wealthy associates on behalf of the campaign. Obama's campaign this year has raised large sums of money in small contributions from a broad network of supporters, while McCain's campaign has relied on a smaller number of big checks. The political parties may take up to $28,500 from an individual every calendar year, but the federal government restricts how much they can spend in coordination with the campaign.\n\nMcCain and Obama are both senators. Do candidates always hold this office?\n\nNo. In fact, the last sitting senator elected president was John Kennedy in 1960. Americans prefer electing governors or former vice-presidents, largely because governors have executive experience that is in many ways analogous to the presidency. Former vice-presidents have already stood on the national and international stage. What else is up for grabs?\n\nThe whole of the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100-member Senate are elected every two years, so those seats are up on November 4. Plus 11 states will hold elections for governor. I won! Now what?\n\nThe next president will be sworn into office on January 20. In the meantime, the president-elect will this year have one of the most urgent transition periods in history because of the fast-changing turmoil in the US economy. The president-elect will immediately begin naming his cabinet and preparing to take the reins in the White House and in the executive agencies.\n\nHow much does the president get paid?\n\nThe president is paid $450,000, including a $50,000 per year expense fund."
