        "text": "Thursday, Aug. 15\n\nVance defends Trump strike comments\n\nSpeaking in west Michigan on Wednesday, Donald Trump’s running mate defended the Republican presidential nominee’s recent comments about firing striking workers that prompted a federal complaint from the United Auto Workers.\n\n\"Trump was not talking about firing Michigan auto workers,\" JD Vance said at a campaign event in Byron Center. \"He was talking about firing the employees of Twitter who used their power to censor American citizens.\"\n\nTrump's controversial comments came Monday during a discussion with Elon Musk, who in 2022 bought Twitter and renamed it X. Musk is also CEO of Tesla, a Texas-based automaker that does not use union labor.\n\n\"I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone. You're all gone. So, every one of you is gone,’” Trump told Musk.\n\nIt’s illegal to fire workers because of a strike or threat of a strike.\n\nThe Detroit-based UAW responded Monday by filing labor charges against Trump and Musk with the National Labor Relations Board. Michigan Democrats also criticized Trump for the comments, including U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow.\n\n\"Bottom line, Donald Trump and JD Vance will never miss an opportunity to screw workers,\" Stabenow said Wednesday ahead of Vance's visit to west Michigan.\n\nBut speaking with reporters after his speech in Byron Center, Vance said Trump was talking about Twitter, which under previous ownership had permanently suspended Trump's account following riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, citing \"risk of further incitement of violence.\"\n\n\"If you censor Americans from exercising their First Amendment rights, you absolutely should be fired,\" Vance said.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nWednesday, Aug. 14\n\nDemocrats raising big bucks for state Supreme Court\n\nMichigan Supreme Court races are heating up in advance of state party conventions this month — and the presumptive Democratic nominees for both the full and partial terms up for grabs this year have a fundraising edge.\n\nIncumbent Justice Kyra Harris Bolden, an appointee of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, will be on the ballot this fall to determine whether she’ll remain on the bench to finish out the remainder of former Chief Justice Bridget McCormack’s term.\n\nVoters will also decide who will replace incumbent Justice David Viviano, who is not seeking reelection this fall.\n\nState Supreme Court seats are technically nonpartisan, but nominees for the general election ballot are selected at state party conventions.\n\nNew campaign finance filings for the seven candidates seeking nominations from their respective parties show Bolden is well ahead of the rest of the field, raising just over $1.1 million this year and reporting more than $920,000 in the bank.\n\nKimberly Ann Thomas, the only candidate seeking the Democratic nomination for the full-term vacancy, followed close behind, raising nearly $827,000. Of that, the campaign has a little over $764,000 still available to spend.\n\nMajor donations for both Democrats came from political action committees tied to labor unions and elected officials, including the Michigan Legacy PAC founded by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the Building Bridges PAC tied to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the SEIU of Michigan PAC and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist’s Stand Tall PAC.\n\nOn the Republican side, multiple candidates are seeking nominations for both the full and partial terms on the ballot.\n\nWith 10 days to go before the state GOP convention, state Rep. Andrew Fink led the Republican field in fundraising. He pulled in slightly more than $83,000 (including large donations from business leader J.C. Huizenga, former Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land and her husband, Daniel Hibma) and reported roughly $18,000 in cash on hand.\n\nHis competitor for the full term nomination, Court of Appeals Judge Mark Boonstra, raised roughly $35,000 — including $20,000 of his own money as well as big donations from former GOP chair Ron Weiser and former Attorney General Mike Cox. He had $7,000 left in the bank.\n\nAmong the three Republicans seeking the chance to challenge Bolden for the partial term, Branch County Circuit Court Judge Patrick William O’Grady has the financial advantage ahead of the convention, putting in $7,000 of his own funds and raising a total of $22,000 with about $5,000 left to spend.\n\nAttorney Alexandria Taylor has largely self-funded her campaign and reported having roughly $7,500 to spend going into the convention. And attorney Matthew DePerno, a Trump loyalist currently battling felony charges for his role in an alleged voting machine tampering scheme, has raised $136.44 from three donors since announcing his campaign and has roughly $50 left to spend.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nTuesday, Aug. 13\n\nKilpatrick speaking to GOP\n\nFormer Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick will be a \"featured speaker\" at an Oakland County Republican Party fundraiser this month, the local party chair announced Tuesday.\n\nKilpatrick is a longtime Democrat who earlier this year endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who as president in 2021 commuted Kilpatrick's 28-year prison sentence after he’d served roughly six years.\n\nIn 2013, Kilpatrick was convicted of 24 felonies stemming from his time as mayor of Detroit, including mail fraud, wire fraud and racketeering.\n\nHe's now set to speak at the Oakland County Republican Party's annual Lincoln Day Dinner on Aug. 21 in Novi, according to Chair Vance Patrick.\n\n“He has a great story of redemption and ministry,” Patrick wrote on social media, where he announced Kilpatrick as a speaker and responded to criticism.\n\nBen Carson, a Detroit native who served under Trump as U.S. Director of Housing and Urban Development, is slated to headline the event.\n\nTickets start at $125, or $200 for a meet-and-greet with Carson.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nTuesday, Aug. 13\n\nUAW files complaint against Donald Trump, Elon Musk over X chat\n\nThe United Auto Workers said Tuesday it has filed federal labor charges with the National Labor Relations Board against former president Donald Trump and Elon Musk, owner of the social media company X.\n\nIn a Monday night interview with Musk on the social media platform, Trump seemed to praise the act of firing employees who threaten to strike, which is illegal under federal law.\n\n\"I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone. You're all gone. So, every one of you is gone,’” Trump said during the conversation with Musk.\n\nMusk is also CEO of Tesla, a Texas-based electric vehicle company that does not use union labor.\n\nUAW president Shawn Fain, in a statement announcing the charges, called the comments “disgusting, illegal and totally predictable.”\n\n“When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean,” said Fain, who has publicly feuded with Trump on multiple occasions.\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes told Axios the filing is \"a shameless political stunt intended to erode President Trump's overwhelming support among America's workers.”\n\nThe union has endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president.\n\n– Lauren Gibbons\n\nMonday, Aug. 12\n\nTrump campaign falsely claims ‘fake’ Harris crowd\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is falsely claiming photos taken last week at Vice President Kamala Harris’ metro Detroit rally were created using artificial intelligence in an effort to boost the appearance of crowd size.\n\nHis claim came after the Harris campaign said the airport hangar rally had been her most well attended event yet, with an estimated 15,000 supporters on hand.\n\nBridge Michigan attended the Wednesday rally and, while unable to verify the 15,000 amount specifically, did observe thousands of people who gathered at the hangar in order to hear Harris and other Democrats speak.\n\nA freelance photographer working for Bridge also took similar photos to the image Trump claimed is fake. The photos show comparable crowd sizes to the image that spurred conspiracy theories echoed by Trump.\n\nAt least a dozen people in the crowd required medical attention due to the hot temperatures within the hangar.\n\nIn a statement posted Sunday to Truth Social, Trump’s own social media website, Trump falsely claimed there was “nobody there” at an airport hangar in Romulus when Harris gave remarks on Wednesday.\n\nInstead, Trump alleged the Harris campaign had used artificial intelligence to show “a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers. “She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE.” Trump wrote. “Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!”\n\nThe Harris campaign refuted Trump’s claims, writing Sunday on social media that the image is \"an actual photo of a 15,000-person crowd for Harris-Walz in Michigan.”\n\nOther Democrats scoffed at the claims. “Trump is simply a unhinged, ridiculous liar,” state Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor wrote on social media.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nSaturday, Aug. 10\n\nJD Vance returning for campaign event in Byron Center\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance will return to Michigan next week for a campaign event in suburban Grand Rapids.\n\nVance is scheduled to speak 2 p.m. Wednesday in Byron Center at Cordes Inc., a trucking and dump trailer company, according to the campaign.\n\nIt'll be Vance's third trip to Michigan since joining the Republican ticket with presidential nominee Donald Trump — and his second visit in as many weeks.\n\nVance spoke last week in Macomb County, where he criticized Democratic policies on public safety and immigration while describing Trump's plans for mass deportations.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and running mate Tim Walz campaigned in Michigan last week, rallying with supporters at a Detroit airport hanger and meeting with United Auto Workers union members in Wayne.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nThursday, Aug. 8\n\nOfficers in Jan. 6 Capitol riots to campaign for Harris\n\nTwo police officers who responded to the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol will be in Michigan Friday to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Harris presidential campaign told Bridge Michigan that Officer Daniel Hodges and former Officer Harry Dunn will hold two roundtables in Grand Rapids and Flint, as well as a press conference in Lansing.\n\nThey’re expected to speak out against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whose attempts to overturn his 2020 loss prompted some supporters to try and block congressional certification of the election.\n\nHowes has worked publicly to dispel misinformation about the riots, during which he was attacked and beaten in the head with his own baton.\n\nDunn, who was awarded a medal by President Joe Biden for his service that day, said in a statement he thinks Harris is “the only candidate in this race who will protect our democracy and move our country forward.”\n\n“Donald Trump, on the other hand, is a convicted felon who has promised to pardon the rioters who violently attacked hundreds of officers like me on January 6,” he added.\n\nTrump has denied instigating the riots but was impeached by the U.S. House for incitement early 2021. He has said he would pardon \"innocent\" people who were charged for the Capitol breach, arguing they were \"convicted by a very tough system.\"\n\nThe police officers visiting Michigan are also expected to touch on Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that Trump has disavowed despite authorship by former administration officials, and a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling giving a president “absolute immunity” for official acts, among other things.\n\nTimes and locations for the events were not immediately made available.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nThursday, Aug. 8\n\nRogers heats up ad wars in U.S. Senate race\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers is up on the air with his first Michigan television advertisement since advancing to the general election in what is expected to be one of the nation's most expensive races.\n\n\"These days, the most expensive vehicle to operate is your grocery cart,\" the narrator says to open the 30-second commercial, which hits Democrats on higher costs caused by inflation.\n\nThe campaign says it's part of a \"six-figure ad buy\" and points to what is expected to be a flood of spending in the race between Rogers and Democratic nominee Elissa Slotkin.\n\nSlotkin and allies are currently on track to outspend Rogers by a significant margin, according to AdImpact, a national tracking firm. As of Wednesday, there had already been nearly $36 million in general election ad reservations for the Democratic candidate, compared to $18.7 million for Rogers.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nThursday, Aug. 8\n\nHarris adviser rejects call for Israel arms embargo\n\nA senior White House official is reaffirming support for Israeli defense after calls for an arms embargo and anti-war protests that briefly interrupted remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris during a campaign stop in Michigan Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the Uncommitted National Movement — which gained traction ahead of Michigan’s February primary as a way for voters to push back against the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza — met with Harris earlier Wednesday to discuss the possibility of an Israeli arms embargo and immediate ceasefire in the region.\n\nBut Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, wrote on social media Thursday that Harris \"will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n\"She does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\" he wrote. \"She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.\"\n\nThe comment comes after a group of protestors gathered inside Harris’ metro Detroit rally, chanting slogans at Harris as she spoke regarding being complicit in a genocide.\n\nHarris at first let the protesters continue their chants, but after a third round of interruptions told the crowd that “if you want Donald Trump to win, say that.”\n\n“Otherwise,” she continued, “I’m speaking.”\n\nIn Michigan, the uncommitted movement gathered around 100,000 votes in the February presidential primary — about 13% of turnout statewide.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nWednesday, Aug. 7\n\nBig crowd greets Harris, Walz at Detroit airport\n\nThousands of supporters turned out Wednesday for the first joint appearance in Michigan by Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee, and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz landed at the Detroit-area airport hangar, where the rally is being held, shortly after 6:15 p.m. to a roaring crowd.\n\nVoters appeared energetic and enthused about the pair throughout the day, despite rising temperatures within the hangar, which caused four separate medical emergencies ahead of their appearance.\n\nThe main event is expected to start at 7 pm. Watch live:\n\nThe Harris and Walz visit comes the same day as a Michigan appearance by U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican 2024 vice presidential nominee, who spoke in Shelby Township earlier Wednesday and described former President Donald Trump's plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nWednesday, Aug. 7\n\nOttawa Impact loses board majority in primary\n\nAn ultra-conservative group of Ottawa County commissioners lost their board majority in Tuesday’s Michigan primary election, according to unofficial results.\n\nFour of Ottawa Impact’s nine endorsed candidates — all incumbents — won Republican primary contests for the 11-member board: Chairperson Joe Moss in the 5th District, Kendra Wenzel in the 6th, Sylvia Rhodea in the 8th and Allison Miedema in the 11th.\n\nBut unofficial results show 1st District incumbent Gretchen Cosby lost badly to Republican challenger James Barry, who was recommended by a more moderate group called Ottawa Integrity. Likewise, 9th District incumbent Roger Belknap lost to Ottawa Integrity-endorsed Philip Kuyers.\n\nThree other candidates endorsed by Ottawa Impact also lost GOP primaries: Ex-commissioner Lucy Ebel, who was recalled from her position in May, fell to Jordan Jorritsma in the 2nd District. Rachel Atwood lost to John Teeples in the 7th District, and Jason Koert lost to Josh Brugger in the 10th District.\n\nThe election losses will end a two-year majority for Ottawa Impact, which garnered attention for changing a county motto that members alleged promoted a “Marxist ideology” and attempting to fire a health officer and replace her with a former employee of an HVAC company, among other things.\n\nMoss and Rhodea formed Ottawa Impact in 2021 in response to Michigan’s mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group of county commissioners rose to prominence after pulling off an impressive grassroots victory in 2022.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nTuesday, Aug. 6\n\nHarris picks Minn. Gov. Tim Walz as running mate\n\nLikely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has picked a Great Lakes governor to be her running mate, choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, she announced Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz, a former U.S. Representative from Minnesota, has been governor since 2019, winning twice. He is a former high school social studies teacher and football coach.\n\nHarris makes a campaign visit to Detroit on Thursday and Walz may join her, according to media reports.\n\nHarris, in an Instagram post, lauded Walz’ background as a high school teacher and football coach who was from a small town; he grew up in Nebraska.\n\n“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep,” Harris wrote in the post. “It’s personal.”\n\nWalz became a darling of the Democratic Party in recent weeks when he criticized Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, his choice for running mate, JD Vance, and their policy proposals as being “weird.”\n\nHis folksy manner — he grew up in a small town and graduated high school in a class of 25 — allowed him to win elections in a Republican-leaning congressional district, a district that Trump won handily in 2016. And he has been clear that his criticisms of Trump do not extend to his supporters.\n\n“And ‘weird’ is specific to him,” Walz said in a podcast with New York Times opinion writer Ezra Klein. “I’m certainly not talking about Republicans. I’m not talking about the people who are at those rallies.”\n\nAs governor, he worked with other Great Lakes governors, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, on campaigns in response to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n— Mike Wilkinson\n\nMonday, Aug. 5\n\nJD Vance to campaign in Macomb County\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance will campaign in Metro Detroit Wednesday, the same day as Vice President Kamala Harris and her yet-to-be announced running mate appear at a Detroit rally.\n\nVance is expected to deliver “remarks to the press” in Shelby Township, a Macomb County suburb more than 20 miles from Detroit. He is expected to use the venue to offer a critique of Harris and President Joe Biden’s tenure in office.\n\nTrump was last in Detroit in May, speaking at a Black church in the city. It will be Vance’s second visit to Michigan since becoming the vice presidential nominee. He joined Trump at a rally in Grand Rapids in July.\n\nVance’s morning appearance will preempt Harris’ Detroit rally, set for later that day. She is set to embark Tuesday on a seven-state battleground tour with her running mate, whose identity is expected to be announced soon.\n\nHarris’ has secured support from enough Democratic National Convention delegates to become the party’s presidential nominee. That will become official when a five-day round of online balloting ends Monday night.\n\nPolling averages from the publications RealClearPolitics and 538 both have Harris slightly ahead of Trump — 2 percentage points — in Michigan, a crucial battleground state.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nMonday, Aug. 5\n\nGOP fumes as Trott joins ‘Republicans for Harris'\n\nFormer Michigan U.S. Rep. Dave Trott is among a group of Republicans endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in the 2024 presidential election – causing his county GOP to formally disavow the ex-lawmaker.\n\nTrott represented Michigan in Congress from 2015 through 2019. He was announced this weekend as a member of “Republicans for Harris.” It’s the latest effort to court GOP-leaning voters displeased with former President Donald Trump, who is once again the party’s presidential nominee.\n\nThe program’s goal, according to a statement posted to social media, is to mobilize Republican voters hoping to “reject the chaos, division, and violence of Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda.”\n\nTrott’s affiliation with the group irked Oakland County Republican Party Chair Vance Patrick, who posted to social media that the former lawmaker is not a recognized member of our party” and disavowed his actions.\n\n“We don’t need fake Republicans like Dave Trott anywhere near our party,” Vance added in a later comment.\n\nTrott has not publicly commented on either his decision to endorse or on Patrick’s comments.\n\nHowever Harris’ national director of Republican outreach, Austin Weatherford, told The Associated Press that he thinks Trump’s “extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values” and will vote against him again in November.\n\nThe campaign, he said, will be “showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party and know that every American deserves a president who will protect their freedoms and a commander in chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own.”\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nFriday, Aug. 2\n\nKamala Harris secures nomination, adds Michigan event\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has secured enough votes from Democratic delegates to become the party's presidential nominee, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison announced Friday.\n\nDelegates voted virtually instead of waiting for the party's official nominating convention, which is set to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nAlso Friday, the White House confirmed that Harris will stretch her Michigan campaign stop into two days next week.\n\nIn addition to her previously scheduled Wednesday night rally in Detroit, the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee is also expected at a Michigan-based “campaign event” Thursday morning.\n\nNo further information was immediately made available.\n\nThe Michigan stops are part of a new battleground state tour for Harris, who is expected to be joined by her yet-unnamed vice presidential running mate.\n\nMichigan is among the handful of swing states both Democrats and Republicans are focused on in the run-up to the Nov. 5 presidential election. Recent polls of Michigan voters show Harris with a narrow advantage over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nHarris’ Michigan stops will be preceded by an appearance in Wisconsin — another of the handful of states considered to be the key to presidential victory in November — earlier Wednesday. She’ll be in North Carolina later Thursday.\n\nHarris has amassed considerable support for the role following President Joe Biden’s July announcement that he was no longer seeking reelection.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nWednesday, July 31\n\nUAW endorses Kamala Harris ahead of Detroit visit\n\nThe United Auto Workers has endorsed Kamala Harris for a president, the union announced Wednesday after a vote from its international executive board.\n\n“Her historic candidacy builds on the Biden-Harris administration’s proven track record of standing with the UAW and delivering major gains for the working class,” the union said, touting Harris’ pro-union record.\n\nThe union had previously endorsed President Joe Biden for reelection before the president ended his campaign for reelection.\n\nThe new endorsement comes ahead of Harris’ planned visit to Detroit next week. While her campaign has not yet released many details, the UAW said she’ll visit the city on Wednesday to “rally with UAW members, Michigan voters and thousands of working class people.”\n\n“Vice President Harris will also meet directly with UAW members and leaders to hear about the issues that matter to Michigan workers,” the union said.\n\nThe UAW has 1 million active and retired members in the U.S. but in 2023 the union reported its lowest membership, at 370,000, since the height of the great recession in 2009. Michigan’s largest union is the AFL-CIO.\n\nMichigan had 564,000 union members in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 13% of Michigan workers.\n\nWhile unions have historically been strongly in favor of Democratic presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump has made significant inroads with workers. According to a 2020 exit poll conducted by CNN, 40% of voters from a union household chose Trump, while 56% voted for then-candidate Joe Biden.\n\nWednesday, July 31\n\nKamala Harris to campaign in Detroit\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is slated to visit Detroit next week with her to-be-announced running mate, according to her campaign through White House pool reports.\n\nHarris and her future vice presidential pick are expected to crisscross the country on a tour of battleground states that stretches from Las Vegas to Philadelphia next week.\n\nThe exact date and location of the event in Detroit has not yet been made public.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid July 21 in the face of growing Democratic discontent, Harris quickly began to consolidate support among key Democrats. Delegates intend to hold a virtual vote next week to formalize her nomination ahead of their convention which begins Aug. 19.\n\nMichigan Democratic Party delegates earlier this month voted with near-unanimous support to assign their newly unbound votes to Harris.\n\nHer potential running mates include several Democratic governors, such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to reports from Axios and other outlets,\n\nSpeculation has also spread, however, to Michigan U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, whose name has emerged as a \"dark horse\" candidate, though he hasn’t confirmed whether he entered the campaign’s vetting process.\n\nHarris has told reporters a final decision has not yet been made, but one is expected within the next week.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer has also been dogged by speculation. first that she could replace Biden and later that she could be Harris’ partner. Whitmer has firmly denied the scuttlebutt, telling reporters. “I’m not leaving Michigan.”\n\nPolling in the presidential race, where Harris is expected to face former President Donald Trump in less than 100 days, has tightened in recent days. Several robust polls have indicated Harris and Trump are statistically tied in Michigan, which is set to be a crucial battleground in the final stretch to the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nDetroit, the state's largest city, has become a focal point. Trump has attempted to make inroads in the Democratic stronghold, courting Black voters in a June roundtable at a local church.\n\nBiden beat Trump in Detroit by a wide margin in 2020 — 228,047 votes, or 94% of all ballots cast — but Trump improved his vote total in the city by 6,154 votes compared to 2016.\n\nSome local Democrats like Wayne County Executive Warren Evans had sounded alarm bells earlier this year, warning the party and Biden campaign of apathy among Black voters heading into the fall.\n\nBut Evans this week praised Harris, saying he now has \"a presidential candidate that I can support 1,000%.\" There’s “not really a choice here,” he said Wednesday. \"Kamala Harris has the background, she has worked for the last four years to help get us where we are.\"\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nTuesday, July 30\n\nDemocrats hope to flip state House seat despite death\n\nA new Democratic write-in candidate has emerged in Genesee County’s 68th state House district, where the passing of former Rep. Tim Sneller left a vacancy in a region where Democrats hope to challenge an incumbent Republican.\n\nSneller, a longtime legislative staffer and former lawmaker, had been the lone Democratic primary candidate in the 2024 cycle after changes to term limit laws made him eligible to run again.\n\nBefore his death earlier this month, Sneller had planned to challenge incumbent state Rep. David Martin, R-Davidson, in the district covering a wide swath of Genesee County and a portion of Oakland County.\n\nMatt Schinkler, a 47-year employee of General Motors who has also served in various community board positions in Genesee County, announced he is running as a write-in candidate to replace Sneller on the general election ballot.\n\nSchinkler did so, he said, “with deep respect and a heavy heart” and hopes to continue Sneller’s legacy.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a two-seat majority in the Michigan House, which is up for grabs again this fall. Both major parties are banking millions of dollars in preparation for a general election fight, which will concentrate around a handful of the state’s most politically competitive seats.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nMonday, July 29\n\nGary Peters enters the veepstakes chat\n\nA new Michigan name has emerged as a \"dark horse\" candidate to serve as a Kamala Harris running mate: U.S. Sen. Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township.\n\nAxios reports that union leaders are leading a \"quiet push\" for Peters to join the Democratic ticket with Harris, the vice president who has quickly amassed support to become the party’s expected presidential nominee.\n\nPeters first won election to the U.S. Senate in 2014. He served in the U.S. House before that. He chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nHis name has not appeared on early lists of potential Harris running mates, which have often included U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who moved to northern Michigan in 2022, has also been mentioned as a potential vice presidential nominee.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has taken herself out of the running but remains a campaign co-chair and said Monday she expects Harris to make her decision within the next week.\n\nMonday, July 29\n\nTrump endorses Paul Junge for Congress\n\nFormer President Donald Trump this weekend announced his \"complete and total endorsement\" to Republican Paul Junge of Grand Blanc in Michigan's closely contested 8th Congressional District.\n\nJunge, of Grand Blanc, is competing in the GOP primary for the seat held by U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, who is not seeking re-election.\n\nOther Republican candidates include businesswoman Mary Draves and trucking company owner Anthony Hudson.\n\nThe Democratic primary features state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet, State Board of Education President Pam Pugh and former Flint Mayor Matt Collier.\n\nJunge, who worked as an external affairs officer with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, challenged Kildee two years ago but lost in the general election.\n\nKildee's departure made quickly made the district one of the most competitive in the state and a top target for both major parties nationally. The district includes Flint, Midland, Bay City and Saginaw to the north.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nWednesday, July 24\n\nDelegates vote to back Kamala Harris at DNC\n\nMichigan Democratic delegates voted almost unanimously Tuesday evening to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed President Joe Biden, who ended his reelection campaign on Sunday.\n\nAll but two of Michigan’s 138 delegates to next month’s Democratic National Convention are now pledged to Harris, who reportedly had already secured enough delegate support to clinch the party’s nomination to take on Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\n“As delegates across the country rally behind Harris, we are excited to continue to unite this party so we can come together in November and elect Democrats up and down the ballot,” state party Chair Lavora Barnes said in a statement.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is slated to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago, but under rules adopted Wednesday, party delegates are expected to nominate Harris and a running mate in a virtual vote by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is expected to address the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. He said on social media that he'll discuss “what lies ahead” and how he will “finish the job for the American people.\"\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nTuesday, July 23\n\nButtigieg not ruling out vice president\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a Michigan resident, on Monday left the door open to serving as the running mate of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nBut Harris is “going to make that decision,” he said in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nIn the days following President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek reelection, support has quickly solidified behind Harris as his replacement atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nA survey by the Associated Press indicates Harris already has the delegate support necessary to clinch the nomination at the August Democratic National Convention.\n\nHer campaign has quickly turned to evaluating potential running mates. CNN reported her campaign has asked for vetting materials from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Tim Walz of Minnesota and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.\n\nRelated: Gretchen Whitmer knocks down VP talk: ‘I’m not leaving Michigan’\n\nWhitmer told reporters yesterday, “I’m not leaving Michigan” when asked if she would accept a spot on the presidential ticket.\n\nWhile Buttigieg hasn’t been mentioned in early vetting reports, he’s been floated as a potential vice presidential nominee.\n\nButtigieg moved to the Traverse City area in 2022, where he lives with his two children and husband, who grew up in the region. He has served in Biden’s cabinet as transportation secretary since the beginning of Biden’s term.\n\nThe former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020. He won the Iowa caucuses but ended his campaign and endorsed Biden in early March after failing to win any other states.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nSaturday, July 20\n\nSandy Pensler ends Senate campaign\n\nMichigan businessman Sandy Pensler said Saturday he is \"ceasing\" his campaign for U.S. Senate and endorsing fellow Republican candidate Mike Rogers.\n\nPensler announced his decision on stage Saturday night at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Grand Rapids, where Trump invited both him and Rogers on stage.\n\n\"My campaign was always about making American better,\" Pensler said.\n\n\"The best way to do that is to enact President Trump's policies. To do that, we need control of the Senate. A divisive, continued primary effort hurts the chances of that.\"\n\nRelated: Donald Trump in west Michigan: 'I took a bullet for democracy'\n\nPensler will remain on the ballot — including absentee ballots that have already gone out — for the Aug. 6 primary. He was among four Republicans seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate race to replace retiring Democrat Debbie Stabenow.\n\nRogers, former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash and physician Sherry O'Donnell remain in the race.\n\nTrump endorsed rogers in March.\n\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin and actor Hill Harper are competing in the Democratic primary.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nSaturday, July 20\n\nWatch Trump rally in Grand Rapids\n\nThousands of supporters were filing into Grand Rapids’ Van Andel Arena Saturday ahead of former President Donald Trump’s first campaign rally with his newly-selected running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance.\n\nWatch Trump's full speech here:\n\nIt is the first joint campaign rally Trump has held since selecting Vance as his running mate and accepting the Republican presidential nomination at his party’s convention in Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\nIt’s also Trump’s first public rally since an assassination attempt one week ago that left his ear injured and the country shaken by the specter of political violence. Supporters throughout the crowd wore apparel bearing the instantly iconic image of Trump raising his fist in the moments after the shooting.\n\nPrior to the event, a line of supporters awaiting entry stretched around the block in downtown Grand Rapids. Security has reportedly been tightened since the assassination attempt and roads around the arena were closed to traffic well ahead of the rally.\n\nOrganizers are expecting a full house when Trump takes the stage at 5 p.m., though the upper deck of the arena is not being occupied. Trump last visited Michigan with a Detroit stop at a Black church in June.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nFriday, July 19\n\nTrump talks autos, UAW and Kid Rock at RNC\n\nIn his first speech since a failed assassination attempt against him, Donald Trump on Thursday night recounted the shooting and accepted the Republican nomination for president.\n\nWatch the full speech here:\n\nThe former president, who is set to return to Michigan on Saturday for a Grand Rapids rally, also took aim at auto industry policies under Democratic President Joe Biden and called for the firing of UAW President Shawn Fain.\n\nIn his speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump said he'd end Biden's \"electric vehicle mandate.\" There is no mandate, but the Biden administration is pushing automakers to build more electric and hybrid vehicles by setting new average emissions standards.\n\nTrump also criticized Biden and Fain for new auto plants being built in Mexico, an apparent reference to Chinese automaker BYD.\n\nTrump said he would put tariffs of between 100% to 200% on the vehicles to make them \"unsellable in the United States.\" Biden in May announced 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and some other products.\n\nTrump also praised Michigan musician Kid Rock, who performed before Trump took the stage in Milwaukee. Other opening acts included wrestler Hulk Hogan and musician Lee Greenwood.\n\nIn a statement, Biden campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said the Democratic incumbent is offering a \"different vision\" for the country than Trump. \"One where we create opportunities for everyone, while making the super wealthy finally pay their fair share.\"\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nWednesday, July 17\n\nWatch John James, Mike Rogers, Perry Johnson at RNC\n\nMichigan U.S. Rep. John James, U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers and businessman Perry Johnson spoke this week on the floor of the Republican National Convention, each touting former President Donald Trump or ridiculing President Joe Biden ahead of the November general election.\n\nWatch their speeches below:\n\nJames, a Shelby Township Republican, began his Monday night speech in Wisconsin by ... touting the NFC North champion Detroit Lions, which drew a few boos from Packers country. But Michigan’s only Black member of Congress got applause as he told the story of his father, who grew up in the Jim Crow South and later founded a successful logistics business in Detroit.\n\nUnder Trump, \"we can once again have a land where hard work truly does get you ahead,” James said. “We can, once again, have a land where you can go from poverty to prosperity in a single generation.\"\n\nRogers, a former member of Congress now running for U.S. Senate, used his Tuesday night speech to provide red meat to the overwhelmingly pro-Trump convention crowd, bashing illegal immigration, the Chinese Communist party, Biden's push for electric vehicles and price spikes caused by inflation.\n\n\"The most expensive vehicle to operate in Michigan in 2024 is your grocery cart, thanks to the Democrats in Washington D.C.,\" he said.\n\nJohnson, a Bloomfield Hills businessman, was perhaps the most unlikely Michigan convention speaker given his limited political history. He ran for governor in 2022 but was disqualified from the primary ballot due to faulty signatures and then last year launched a long-shot presidential campaign against Trump before bowing out to endorse the former president.\n\nBut Johnson revved up the crowd in Milwaukee on Tuesday night with strong statements of loyalty to Trump: \"He has the heart of a lion, the brain of a genius — and he's done it before. President Trump is ready to save our country. To 'make America great again,' again.”\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nTuesday, July 16\n\nDonald Trump returning to Michigan on Saturday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to campaign in Grand Rapids on Saturday for what is expected to be his first public political rally since a gunman attempted to assassinate him last weekend in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe campaign stop will also be Trump’s first trip to Michigan with U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who he tapped as his running mate on Monday before Republicans formally voted them to be the party’s presidential and vice presidential nominees.\n\nThe Grand Rapids rally is scheduled to begin Saturday at 5 p.m. in Van Andel Arena, with doors opening at 1 p.m.\n\nWest Michigan has historically been a conservative region, but redistricting, an increasingly liberal Grand Rapids and moderate voter frustration with Trump contributed to a political shift that Republicans are working to reverse.\n\nTrump narrowly won Kent County in 2016, besting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by about three percentage points. But current President Joe Biden flipped the county in 2016, beating Trump by about six points en route to his statewide win.\n\nSaturday’s stop will mark the second time this year Trump will be back in the region. He campaigned in Grand Rapids on April 2 to criticize Biden’s immigration policies.\n\nTrump is expected to again revisit that topic, as well as touch on inflation, the opioid epidemic and crime during Saturday’s rally, according to a statement from his campaign.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nPresidential visits\n\nAs a battleground state, Michigan residents are seeing a lot of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 5 general election.

Hillary Scholten became the first member of Michigan’s Democratic congressional delegation to call on President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid and allow for an alternative candidate.\n\nBiden, who spoke at a Friday campaign rally in Detroit, said he will not leave the race and predicted he will win in the fall despite close polling in Michigan and other “blue wall” states.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nMonday, July 15\n\nTrump taps Ohio’s JD Vance as VP pick\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has selected U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his vice presidential running mate, ending weeks of speculation on who the Republican would pick to join him at the top of the ticket.\n\nVance, 39, was elected to office in 2022 and currently serves as Ohio’s junior Senator, giving Trump another Midwest connection on the ticket after parting ways with former Vice President Mike Pence of Indiana.\n\nVance gained prominence for his 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which was later made into a film.\n\nTrump, in announcing his choice on social media, lauded Vance’s academic, military and business career. Vance was among the handful of Trump’s vice presidential hopefuls, which included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\n“J.D. has had a very successful business career in Technology and Finance,” Trump wrote, “and now, during the Campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.”\n\nNews of Vance’s selection was immediately met with cheers from Michigan Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who is currently in the running for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nVance “will be a tremendous vice president,” Roger said in a statement, calling the selection “another sign” that Trump is “focused on helping middle class Americans achieve the American Dream.”\n\nMichigan Democrats, meanwhile, criticized the choice.\n\n“Trump has only ever surrounded himself with extremists who agree with his far-right agenda, and J.D. Vance is certainly no different,” state party Chair Lavora Barnes said in a statement.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nMonday, July 15\n\nJohn James, Mike Rogers, Perry Johnson to speak at RNC\n\nMichigan U.S. Rep. John James, U.S. Senate hopeful Mike Rogers and businessman Perry Johnson will speak at the Republican National Convention this week in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and Donald Trump's presidential campaign announced planned speakers over the weekend but have not yet detailed speaking times.\n\nThe convention runs Monday through Thursday in Milwaukee. Formal sessions are slated for:\n\nMonday 12:45-4:45 p.m.\n\nMonday 5:45-10:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday 5-10:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday 5:45-10:00 p.m.\n\nThursday 5:45-10:30 p.m.\n\nTrump, who survived an assassination attempt on Saturday evening, is expected to speak at the convention on Thursday night as he accepts the party's presidential nomination.\n\nMultiple television networks are expected to broadcast the convention. The RNC will also stream speeches on YouTube.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nFriday, July 12\n\nFull video of Joe Biden campaign speech in Detroit\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke at a campaign rally Friday evening in Detroit, vowing to continue his reelection campaign and take on former President Donald Trump.\n\nWatch his speech in the video player below.\n\nThe Michigan campaign rally came as Biden pushes back against calls from some fellow Democrats to end his reelection campaign to allow for an alternative nominee to take on Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to portions of his speech released ahead of the event, Biden was expected to promise that the first bill he'd sign in a second term would \"restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.\"\n\nBiden was also expected to discuss raising the federal minimum wage, banning assault weapons and Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term that the former president has attempted to distance himself from in recent weeks.\n\nInkster resident Diane Jones said she came to Biden’s rally at Detroit Renaissance High School so she can see the president's performance for herself and decide whether to support him or a different candidate.\n\nA longtime volunteer for Democratic campaigns and causes, Jones said she hoped Biden will address education and criminal justice issues — and make a compelling case for why she should vote for him.\n\n“Everybody talks about how he's not fit and everything else, but I don't know for sure,” she told Bridge Michigan.\n\nThere’s nothing that will change Tom Moran’s mind. Holding a homemade sign outside of the rally stating “Pass the Torch, Joe,” Moran said he wanted to see an open Democratic convention next month where other candidates compete for the presidential nomination.\n\nThe Fenton resident and lifelong Democrat said if another Democratic candidate doesn’t come forward, he’ll be supporting Cornel West, a third-party candidate.\n\n“I'm not voting for Joe Biden — I saw the debate, and he's just not up to the job,” Moran said. “I think it would be reckless and irresponsible for me to support Biden. And my fear is he's going to stay on the ticket, drag the other Democrats down.”\n\nDeborah Sawicki, of Clinton Township, said she believes Biden is being treated unfairly by members of the party. She remains a staunch supporter, telling Bridge that Biden’s honesty and previous success against Trump are qualification enough to remain on the ticket.\n\n“I’m sending prayers and the power of the Holy Spirit to help Joe remain president,” Sawicki said.\n\nAhead of his Detroit rally, Biden also made a stop at the Garage Grill & Fuel Bar in Northville, located in the district of U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, who had joined Biden on the flight from Washington, along with U.S. Reps. Haley Stevens and Shri Thanedar.\n\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Mayor Mike Duggan were among the Democratic dignitaries who greeted Biden when he landed at the Detroit airport shortly before 4 p.m.\n\nAsked whether she believed Biden should be the Democratic nominee, Benson demurred, telling reporters she’s “just focused on making sure people know what’s at stake this year and know how to exercise their vote.”\n\n— Lauren Gibbons and Jonathan Oosting\n\nThursday, July 11\n\nElection tampering case on hold after judge nixes hearing\n\nHillsdale County District Court Judge Megan Stiverson on Thursday called off a preliminary examination that would have determined whether two Trump loyalists charged with election tampering should be brought to trial.\n\nFrom the bench of a packed courtroom, Stiverson said she would grant a motion from attorney Dan Hartman — who is representing attorney Attorney Stefanie Lambert and former Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott in the case — to appeal her recent rejection of a motion to dismiss.\n\nLambert and Scott were charged with multiple felonies in May after Attorney General Dana Nessel alleged Scott refused mandatory maintenance of a voting machine tabulator following the 2020 presidential election. Lambert, serving as Scott’s lawyer at the time, is accused of illicitly transmitting 2020 general election data from the Adams Township electronic poll book under Scott’s direction.\n\nScott faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, while Lambert faces up to 15 years. They have each pleaded not guilty.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Richard Cunningham called Thursday’s delay “unprecedented and unnecessary.” He declined to comment further after the hearing.\n\nA possible future date for continuing the preliminary examination was not set before court recessed early Thursday.\n\nIt's the latest delay in a series of cases stemming from failed efforts to try to prove that fraud cost former President Donald Trump the 2020 election, including so-called “fake electors” cases that have been stalled in district court.\n\nLambert is facing additional felonies in Oakland County, where she is set to stand trial in October in a separate voting machine tampering case.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nWednesday, July 10\n\nFarm union endorses Slotkin for U.S. Senate\n\nThe Michigan Farmers Union on Wednesday endorsed Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin, calling the congress member a leader who “understands the challenges facing Michigan's family farmers.”\n\nThe state's conservative-leaning agriculture community, long aligned with outgoing U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, could play a key role in deciding who replaces her in the Senate. The race is widely considered a tossup in the general election and one of the most competitive in the country.\n\nCiting Slotkin's current role on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and her national security background, Michigan Farmers Union President Bob Thompson said Slotkin is poised to advocate for the state's agricultural interests in the Senate and protect farmers from foreign threats to the industry.\n\nRelated:\n\nMichigan’s ‘queen of ag’ is retiring, risking Democratic U.S. Senate seat\n\nWhat farmers want from Michigan’s next U.S. Senator\n\nOther major farm organizations like the Michigan Farm Bureau’s AgriPAC committee have not yet offered endorsements in the race.\n\nSlotkin currently lives on a family farm in Holly, which was once part of Hygrade Meat Company run by her grandfather, Hugo Slotkin.\n\nShe serves on the House Agriculture Committee and previously told Bridge Michigan she sees food security and the future of farming as a national security issue critical to Michigan and the nation’s success.\n\nBoth Slotkin and her Democratic primary opponent, Detroit actor and businessman Hill Harper, have said they’d seek placement on the Senate’s agriculture committee if elected.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, a front runner for the GOP nomination, has said his top agricultural priorities include removing regulatory barriers for farmers, reforming the H-2A visa program to provide access to more agricultural labor and renegotiating trade deals to protect farmers from subsidized foreign imports.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nTuesday, July 9\n\nDemocratic legislator calls for Biden withdraw\n\nState Rep. Phil Skaggs of Grand Rapids has become Michigan’s first Democratic legislator to publicly call for President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.\n\n“After decades of public service, the highest, final service President Biden can perform for the country is to announce he will end his run for reelection and release his delegates to the Democratic National Convention,” Skaggs wrote in a lengthy thread on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, Skaggs continued, “indications are that we may be headed to a significant defeat in the fall.”\n\nSkaggs wrote that he was troubled by Biden’s “inability to be an effective communicator” during a June 27 debate that left Democrats shaken and opened questions into Biden’s ability to run a vigorous reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nRelated: As Biden reassures Democrats, cracks emerge in Michigan’s united front\n\n“I am confident a second Trump imperial presidency will be a calamity of historic and global proportions,” Skaggs added. “We must save our democracy from a takeover by a criminal and his gang.”\n\nStill, there are prominent Michigan Democrats who steadfastly support Biden, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has also sought to end speculation that she could step in as an alternative should Biden bow out.\n\n“I don’t foresee any change in this race, and the president and vice president have my full support,” Whitmer said Tuesday morning on Good Morning America.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nSunday, July 7\n\nJoe Biden to campaign in Detroit amid calls to withdraw\n\nPresident Joe Biden will return to Michigan this week to campaign amid calls by some Democratic officials for him to end his re-election bid and open up the party's nomination to another candidate.\n\nBiden is set to visit Detroit on Friday, according to an advisory from his campaign, which did not announce any additional details but said it will do at a later date.\n\nThe Detroit stop will be Biden's fourth trip this year to Michigan and first since a debate performance against former President Donald Trump renewed questions over the 81-year-old president's ability to win re-election and lead the country for another four years.\n\nSome members of his own party, including former Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lon Johnson, have urged Biden to withdraw from the presidential race ahead of the August nominating convention.\n\n\"It’s clear the president is suffering from cognitive decline, and the actions by him, his family, and staff since the debate have only reinforced that belief,\" Johnson wrote last week on Facebook. \"He will be remembered for a lifetime of honorable service to our country.\"\n\nBiden has said he has no plans to withdraw.\n\n\"I am running — and going to win again,\" the president said Friday in a Wisconsin rally.\n\n\"I'm not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out three and a half years of work,\" Biden added on social media.\n\nWere Biden to step down, Democratic delegates could select a new presidential nominee at the party's upcoming Chicago convention, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 19.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been floated as a potential contender, but she has attempted to quell speculation while publicly affirming her support for Biden.\n\nBiden \"is our nominee,\" Whitmer wrote on social media last week. \"He is in it to win it and I support him.\"\n\nBiden and Trump have both recently campaigned in Detroit, courting Black voters in the traditional Democratic stronghold where turnout could help decide the presidential election.\n\nBiden spoke at an NAACP dinner in May. Trump spoke at a church and conservative conference in June.\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nWednesday, July 3\n\nWhitmer, governors to meet with Biden as speculation swirls\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer will meet with President Joe Biden in the White House alongside other Democratic governors Wednesday evening, a Whitmer spokesperson confirmed to Bridge.\n\nThe meeting comes amid growing calls for Biden to leave the presidential race after his halting debate performance last week.\n\nWhitmer plans to attend the event with Democratic governors from nine other states, while more expected to join virtually, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSpeculation has refused to quiet about Whitmer’s presidential prospects should Biden exit the race. Whitmer, a national co-chair of Biden’s campaign, remains a full-throated supporter of the President, though her online appeals to support his reelection link to her own federal fundraising account, Fight Like Hell PAC, rather than Biden’s own fundraising.\n\nOn Monday a Politico Magazine column quoted “someone close to a potential 2028 Whitmer rival” claiming she told Biden’s campaign Michigan is no longer winnable after the debate.\n\nHours later, Whitmer’s X account posted a succinct denial: “Anyone who claims I would say that we can’t win Michigan is full of shit.”\n\nBiden’s wife, Jill, is scheduled to be in Traverse City on Wednesday. On Thursday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom — another politician frequently mentioned as a stand-in candidate — will campaign for Biden in Van Buren County.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nWednesday, July 3\n\nHouse campaign chair, finance chair resign\n\nTwo lawmakers leading 2024 campaign operations for Michigan House Democrats have resigned, according to multiple news outlets.\n\nThe Detroit News and Gongwer News Service reported Wednesday that Reps. Regina Weiss, D-Oak Park, and Samantha Steckloff, D-Farmington Hills, offered their resignations ahead of an internal Tuesday meeting of House Democrats.\n\nHouse Speaker Joe Tate, D-Detroit, is reportedly in the process of revising the campaign structure.\n\nCampaign chairs for legislative caucuses typically set statewide strategy and fundraising plans with the goal of defending vulnerable districts and potentially picking up competitive seats.\n\nThe 2024 cycle is critical for Democratic House leadership as they prepare to defend their slim majority in the chamber from Republicans eager to win it back.\n\nThe resignations come after a turbulent budget debate, where several Democrats disputed a move to pass the budget without also moving a policy bill involving changes to the state’s retirement system for public school employees.\n\n– Lauren Gibbons\n\nTuesday, July 2\n\nJill Biden headlines Traverse City campaign office opening\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden is heading to Michigan on Wednesday to help open a campaign office in Traverse City, President Joe Biden’s campaign announced Tuesday.\n\nThe office opening announcement is 1 p.m. Wednesday, where Jill Biden will be joined by Chasten Buttigieg, a northern Michigan native and husband to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigeig.\n\nJill Biden is reportedly scheduled to land in Grand Rapids Tuesday afternoon, according to CBS News.\n\nPrior to Wednesday’s campaign event, Biden will attend events in Middleville near Grand Rapids to promote summer nutrition programs for children and visit the Hidden Helpers summer camp, the outlet reported.\n\nThe new Traverse City location will be the campaign’s 45th Michigan office for recruiting and training volunteers.\n\nJill Biden last visited Michigan in May, where she made several Upper Peninsula campaign stops with Douglas Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nTuesday, July 2\n\nDave Chappelle raising money for Hill Harper\n\nDemocrat Hill Harper is teaming with comedian Dave Chappelle for a campaign fundraiser scheduled on July 11 in Detroit’s St. Andrew’s Hall.\n\nDoors for the show open at 6 p.m. for the 7:30 p.m. show. General admission is $500, with balcony tickets costing $250. Tickets are available online.\n\nHarper is taking on U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Holly for a shot at Michigan’s hotly contested open U.S. Senate seat. The winner of the Aug. 6 primary faces one of four Republicans: former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, businessman Sandy Pensler or Dr. Sherry O’Donnell.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nTuesday, July 2\n\nDan Kildee endorses McDonald Rivet\n\nRetiring U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee endorsed state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, on Tuesday to succeed him in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn a statement, Kildee said a “spirited primary” had emerged in the district but called McDonald Rivet “the best candidate to represent mid-Michigan going forward” and someone who “fights every day for working people.”\n\nA Democrat, Kildee served six terms and won reelection in his newly-drawn district by more than 10 percentage points in 2022. In November, he announced he would not seek reelection, a decision prompted by a recent battle with cancer.\n\nRelated: Whitmer endorses in key congressional primary\n\n“When I announced my retirement from Congress, I said I'd do everything I could to help elect common sense, principled, results-oriented leaders,” Kildee said at a campaign event for McDonald Rivet in Flint. “And that's why I'm speaking out, supporting and endorsing Kristen McDonald Rivet.”\n\nMcDonald Rivet faces State Board of Education president Pamela Pugh and former Flint mayor Matt Collier in the Aug. 6 Democratic primary.\n\nKildee’s endorsement follows those of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last week, United Auto Workers and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has named the district among its priorities.\n\nThe district stretches from Flint’s southern suburbs north along Lake Huron to Pinconning and includes Saginaw and Midland.\n\n— Simon D. Schuster\n\nFriday, June 28\n\nWhitmer presidential buzz ramps up after Biden debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden's sluggish performance in Thursday night's debate renewed speculation over whether Democrats could still replace him on the ballot this fall with an alternative candidate.\n\nExperts say Gov. Gretchen Whitmer could be a legitimate contender should Biden step down before the party's August nominating convention, which he has given no indication he plans to do.\n\n\"I wish Biden would reflect on this debate performance and then announce his decision to withdraw from the race, throwing the choice of Democratic nominee to the convention,\" progressive columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote Thursday night on social media.\n\nRelated: Gretchen Whitmer says she won’t replace Biden. What happens if that changes?\n\nSomeone like Whitmer, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio or Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo \"could still jump in and beat\" Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive GOP nominee, Kristof predicted, before making similar arguments in a New York Times column.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former Republican turned Democrat strategist who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, predicted after the first hour of the debate that Biden will be a \"one-term president.\"\n\n\"He still has the chance to watch a Democrat be inaugurated,\" Schmidt wrote on social media. \"There are 68 days until the DNC. Whitmer/Moore beats Trump,\" Schmidt added, referencing Maryland Gov. Wes Moore as a possible Whitmer running mate.\n\nWhitmer, for her part, has served as a national campaign co-chair for Biden and has previously denied any attempt to try and replace him as this year's Democratic nominee.\n\nWhitmer was reportedly expected in Los Angeles Thursday night for a debate watch party fundraiser for the Biden campaign, and she tweeted praise for Biden shortly after the debate began.\n\nWhitmer released a statement Friday morning that touted Biden but did not directly reference his debate performance.\n\n\"Joe Biden is running to serve the American people. Donald Trump is running to serve Donald Trump,\" she said.\n\n\"The difference between Joe Biden’s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump’s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November.”\n\nBiden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said the president \"presented a positive and winning vision for the future of America\" in the debate.\n\nMichigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said the debate presented a \"clear choice\" between Biden and Trump, who \"could not be more out of step with the values of Michiganders.\"\n\n— Jonathan Oosting\n\nThursday, June 27\n\nWatch Joe Biden, Donald Trump debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump debated Thursday night as they compete for a second term in the White House.\n\nMiss it? You can watch the debate, hosted by CNN, below.\n\nTuesday, June 25\n\nWhitmer endorses in key congressional primary\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday endorsed state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, to succeed retiring U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint, in the Michigan’s closely contested 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn a video posted to the X social media platform, Whitmer said Rivet would “fight like hell for Michiganders” in congress, “just like she's been doing in the state legislature,” highlighting recent Democratic policy wins in Lansing.\n\nMcDonald Rivet has two primary challengers for the Democratic nomination: State Board of Education President Pamela Pugh, and former Flint Mayor Matt Collier.\n\nKildee served six terms and won reelection in his newly-drawn district by more than 10 percentage points in 2022, but announced in November 2023 he would not seek reelection in, a decision he said was spurred by a recent battle with cancer.\n\nThe district has become more conservative since 2020 redistricting. Kildee’s district had once been anchored solely by Flint but now stretches north to encompass the more conservative tri-cities region consisting of Midland, Saginaw and Bay City.\n\nIt means the congressional race is expected to be one of the state’s closest. Though there has been little public polling yet conducted in the race, one hypothetical matchup between McDonald Rivet and a GOP challenger, Paul Junge, had the two candidates statistically tied with about a fifth of voters undecided.\n\nIn the Republican primary, Junge, a businessman, is competing against Midland native Mary Draves, who recently picked up the endorsement of the Saginaw County Republican Party. Anthony Hudson, another candidate in the GOP primary, recently drew widespread criticism for posting an AI-generated video of Martin Luther King Jr. endorsing his campaign.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nMonday, June 24\n\nBiden, Trump to debate. How to watch, what to watch for\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will debate Thursday night for the first time since the 2020 election, which saw Biden narrowly win Michigan by 154,188 votes en route to an Electoral College victory.\n\nThe presumptive presidential nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, are set to share the stage for a 90 minute debate that starts at 9 p.m. CNN will host from its network studios in Atlanta. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate.\n\nYou should be able to watch the debate on many major TV networks, as the CNN event will be simulcast on NBC, ABC, C-SPAN and more. For viewers without a subscription, CNN is also expected to air the debate live on its website.\n\nThe June 27 debate will mark \"the earliest general election debate since televised presidential debates began in 1960, according to Dustin Carnahan, an associate professor in Michigan State University’s College of Communication Arts and Sciences.\n\nThat's possible because of the \"long-held status of both Biden and Trump as the presumptive nominees for their parties,\" Carnahan said in a pre-debate analysis distributed by the university.\n\nDebates usually don't change many minds because they are typically viewed by people who are already politically engaged, he added.\n\n\"But in a year when each campaign has made no secret of its strategy of questioning the other’s fitness for office, any significant gaffes by either of the candidates during the debate is likely to dominate messaging by the campaigns and in news coverage as evidence of that candidate’s decline,” Carnahan said.\n\n“And given the longer period between the first and second debate in 2024 — two months rather than a week or two in a normal debate schedule — attempts at damage control might prove more challenging as a poor performance is likely to linger.\"\n\nThursday, June 20\n\nSlotkin says abortion rights fight not over\n\nProminent abortion rights advocates gathered in Grand Rapids on Thursday to campaign for U.S. Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin, arguing their fight didn’t end in 2022 when Michigan voters added abortion rights to the state constitution.\n\nEMILYs List President Jessica Mackler, Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson and Reproductive Freedom for All President Mini Timmaraju joined Slotkin, who said abortion opponents have not stopped their efforts to limit access after the downfall of Roe v. Wade two years ago.\n\nShe pointed to a recent legal challenge to abortion medication prescriptions that was ultimately tossed by the U.S. Supreme Court and near-total abortion bans in other states.\n\n“They brought this fight, and we cannot let them win this fight,” Slotkin said.\n\nAbortion advocates won big at the Michigan ballot box two years ago with passage of Proposal 3, which wrote abortion rights and reproductive health access into the state constitution. Democrats, too, saw success at the polls, winning a sweep of statewide offices and majority control of the Legislature.\n\nWhile leading Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers has said he won’t try to “undo” the Michigan law, abortion rights groups on Thursday urged voters to avoid complacency, pointing to the possibility of a federal abortion ban.\n\n“We know that what we did here in Michigan could so easily be stripped away next year if we are not able to take back the House, if we lose the Senate and lose the presidency,” Timmaraju said.\n\nFormer president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in April that he believed laws enforcing abortion access should be left to the states. He did not directly say whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if congressional Republicans put one on his desk.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nThursday, June 20\n\nMichigan GOP chair welcomes Doug Burgum: ‘Maybe a Trump VP?’\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum visited Michigan on Thursday as a surrogate for former President Donald Trump, who is reportedly considering Burgum as a potential running mate as he campaigns to return to the White House.\n\nBurgum toured a butcher’s shop in Walker with Republican officials, including Michigan GOP chairman Pete Hoekstra, who joined the running mate speculation with a morning tweet: “Welcome Governor Burgum to West Michigan! Maybe a Trump VP?”\n\nLater Thursday, Burgum is expected to attend a Michigan GOP fundraiser reception at Ucellos in downtown Grand Rapids.\n\nBurgum, in his second term as Governor of North Dakota, was a presidential candidate before announcing he was suspending his campaign in December 2023.\n\nTrump was in Detroit last Saturday, speaking in a church in a bid to win support from Black voters, though the audience was largely white.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Kent County, where Burgum visited, by a slim margin in the 2020 election.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nTuesday, June 18\n\nSupremes mull Benson poll challenger rules\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday morning in a two year-old suit challenging the breadth of election guidance the Michigan Secretary of State can issue and how far-reaching it can be.\n\nAt issue is whether Jocelyn Benson’s department could legally issue guidance for poll challengers ahead of the 2022 election without using the administrative rules process, and if the instructions they issued followed Michigan election law.\n\nMay 2022 rules required partisan poll challengers to be credentialed by their parties. They couldn’t carry cell phones or speak with election inspectors. Republicans, including the state and national parties, challenged the rules and the department’s process. The Michigan Court of Claims and Court of Appeals ruled for the GOP, but the rules have remained in place through the legal battle.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Heather Meingast, who represented the state on Wednesday, told Supreme Court justices that a requirement to use the rulemaking process in such instances “threatens the Secretary's ability to issue timely and effective instructions” for future elections.\n\nThe rules aimed, in part, to manage an increasingly contentious vote-counting process by heading off combative poll challengers who are more disruptive than scrutinizing.\n\nJustice David Viviano, a Republican nominee, seemed skeptical about the scope of one rule that would require challengers to refer their disputes to a “challenger liaison.” He expressed concerns those liaisons, under the department’s rule, could throw away challenges they deemed frivolous.\n\n“Where does the Secretary find the authority to have clerks determine which challenges are permissible, such that they don't even have to be adjudicated, much less recorded for future review by anybody?” he asked.\n\nAt the same time, an attorney representing the Republican National Committee, Robert Avers, didn’t have a direct answer for how — without those rules — election officials could address a poll challenger making constant objections to voters’ eligibility.\n\n“There has to be this collaboration between the inspector and the challenger,” Avers said, suggesting there could be a discussion before turning to law enforcement and removal.\n\nThe determination by the seven-member court could have far-reaching effects on the ability of state officials to fine-tune the administration of Michigan’s election. Liberals have a 4-3 advantage on the court.\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nTuesday, June 18\n\nTrump endorses Barrett for Congress\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has endorsed Republican Tom Barrett in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District race, his second non-incumbent Michigan endorsement of the cycle so far.\n\nBarrett would “be an incredible representative” for the district, Trump said in a Monday message posted to his own social media site, Truth Social.\n\n“Tom bravely served our Country as an Army Helicopter Pilot and, in Congress, he will Secure our Border, Defend our Law Enforcement, Support our Military/Vets, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,” Trump wrote. “Tom has my Complete and Total Endorsement!”\n\nBarrett, a former Michigan state senator, has no Republican primary challengers. He will take on Curtis Hertel, a Democrat and former colleague in the Michigan Senate, in November. Hertel is also not facing a challenge in the August primary.\n\nThis is Trump’s second non-incumbent Michigan endorsement of the 2024 cycle. In March, he endorsed former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat. He has also endorsed every member of Michigan's Republican congressional delegation for the 2024 cycle.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nFriday, June 14\n\nDems to fly sky banner over Trump boat parade in Detroit\n\nAhead of Donald Trump’s visit to Detroit this weekend, the Democratic National Committee is planning to hit the city with advertisements attacking the former president.\n\nTrump supporters traveling down the Detroit River in a “boat parade” on Saturday are expected to be greeted by a plane flying overhead with a banner that says “Trump’s a Crook, Don’t Let Em Sink Ur Boat.”\n\nThe sky banner will fly the length of the boat parade’s three-hour route from Lake St. Clair to Hart Plaza in downtown Detroit from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe parade is slated to end next to Huntington Place, the convention center where Trump is scheduled to address a convention of conservative activists hosted by the organization Turning Point Action.\n\nAt the time of the parade, Trump is slated to be in a church in northwest Detroit, where his campaign said he will attend a roundtable of community leaders.\n\n“This weekend, Michigan voters will be reminded of how Trump is unfit to lead, not only as a convict, but as a failed leader who left working families behind during his first term,” DNC spokesperson Stephanie Justice said in a statement. “Trump will continue to prop up his extreme, anti-freedom agenda and attack democracy in Detroit, but Michiganders know better than to listen to a crook who always puts his own interests first.”\n\nDetroit has become a focal point for the campaign of President Joe Biden, where he, Vice President Kamala Harris and key surrogates have made repeated stops in recent months. Biden most recently spoke at the Detroit Branch NAACP’s Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner in May.\n\nThe DNC is also running digital billboard ads on freeways into the city in English and Spanish, saying “Trump and his fellow crooks are in Detroit asking for your vote. But it’s a scam, they don’t care about you, they’re just out for themselves.”\n\nA statement from Trump’s campaign said “President Donald Trump loves the people of Michigan and is doing what it takes to stop (Joe Biden) from continuing to destroy our great nation.”\n\n— Simon Schuster\n\nFriday, June 14\n\nDePerno runs for state Supreme Court despite indictment\n\nAttorney Matthew DePerno, a Trump loyalist currently battling felony charges for his role in an alleged voting machine tampering scheme, is running for the Michigan Supreme Court.\n\nIn a statement, DePerno said he is running for a seat on the state’s highest court, in part, because \"activist judges, prosecutors and attorney generals are using their power to prosecute their political enemies.\"\n\n“After watching the abuse of our legal system both here in Michigan, as well as across the country, it is clear that the Michigan Supreme Court needs members that are committed to following the constitution and rule of law,” he said.\n\nThe Michigan GOP confirmed DePerno’s candidacy Thursday morning, listing him as one of three August convention candidates who will compete for the party's nomination to a partial-term seat.\n\nThe Kalamazoo-area lawyer has never held elected office or a judicial post. He was the Michigan Republican Republican Party’s nominee for attorney general in 2022 but lost to Democrat Dana Nessel. He also ran for Michigan GOP Chair last year but lost a convention vote to Kristina Karamo, who has since been replaced.\n\nDePerno gained notoriety in conservative circles for his 2020 lawsuit that alleged a reported vote total in Antrim County was evidence that fraud cost then-President Donald Trump in that year’s election.\n\nDePerno lost that case, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied his appeal.\n\nAlong with former state Rep. Daire Rendon and fellow attorney Stefanie Lambert, DePerno is now facing criminal charges for an alleged pro-Trump plot to illegally access voting machines following the 2020 election. He’s pleaded not guilty.\n\nSupreme Court candidates are technically nonpartisan, but they are nominated at conventions by political parties.\n\nDePerno is running for a partial-term seat currently held by Justice Kyra Harris Bolden, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer who is also running to complete the term.\n\nHe’ll have competition: Branch County Judge Patrick William O’Grady and former gubernatorial candidate Alexandria Taylor are also seeking that GOP nomination.\n\nAlso on the ballot is an opening for a full term on the court after Justice David Viviano, a GOP nominee, announced he wouldn't seek re-election.\n\nRep. Andrew Fink, R-Adams Township, and Appellate Court Judge Mark Boonstra are both seeking the Republican nomination for that seat, while University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Ann Thomas is seeking the Democratic nomination.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nMonday, June 10\n\nTucker Carlson, Kid Rock coming to Grand Rapids\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to visit Michigan in September as part of a national arena tour featuring conversations about the 2024 presidential election with high profile conservative figures.\n\nAmong them: Michigan native Kid Rock, who Carlson plans to interview at Grand Rapids’ Van Andel arena on Sept. 20. Tickets go on sale June 14.\n\nThe 15-stop tour will feature conversations “about pressing issues facing our nation today,” including the 2024 presidential election and “today’s American culture,” according to an event listing from Moms for America, a national conservative education advocacy group.\n\nCarlson’s planned stop will come just over a month after Michigan’s Aug. 6 congressional primary and will undoubtedly serve as a means to advocate for former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nOther guests on Carlson’s national tour include actress Rosanne Barr, former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, a Georgia Republican.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nSaturday, June 8\n\nVP Kamala Harris rips Trump conviction in Detroit\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Michigan on Saturday to raise campaign funds and rouse Democratic Party activists as she and President Joe Biden seek re-election this fall.\n\nHarris first stopped in Ann Arbor for a private fundraiser that included actress Octavia Spencer, according to pool reports. The vice president then visited Black Stone Bookstore and Cultural Center in Ypsilanti before heading to Detroit for the Michigan Democratic Party's annual Legacy Dinner fundraiser.\n\nHarris spoke at the Detroit event, where she began by addressing the Gaza war and the recent Israeli rescue of four hostages held by Hamas.\n\nShe was briefly interrupted by a protester but reiterated Biden's recent comments that \"it is time for this war to end,” according to a recording of the speech.\n\nHarris also took multiple jabs at former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee who was recently convicted on felony counts in a hush money case in New York.\n\n\"Simply put, Donald Trump really thinks he is above the law,\" Harris said. “He really does. And this should be disqualifying for anyone who wants to be president of the United States.\"\n\nVictoria LaCivita, a spokesperson for Team Trump Michigan and the state GOP, dismissed the conviction as the result of a \"rigged political witch hunt.” She accused the Biden campaign of focusing on the case \"because they are failing Michiganders on the issues every single day.\"\n\nFriday, June 7\n\nCourt dismisses disqualification challenge\n\nNasser Beydoun, a Democrat running for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat, is still poised to miss the primary ballot after an appeals court panel on Friday rejected a lawsuit contending he was wrongly disqualified.\n\nBeydoun was removed from the ballot last week by the Board of State Canvassers because he used a P.O. box, rather than a required home address, on his nominating petitions — citing personal safety concerns.\n\nA Michigan Court of Appeals panel, in denying his request for relief, wrote that while “not unsympathetic” to Beydoun’s argument, he could have prioritized his privacy and still complied with state law by listing a business address rather than a home address.\n\nJudges, however, have yet to weigh in on a suit filed by Dr. Anil Kumar, a Democrat running in Michigan's 10th Congressional district. Kumar was removed from the ballot after state Bureau of Elections staff “identified at least 47 petition sheets showing clear indications of fraud.”\n\nIf courts decide to take up Kumar’s suit, they’ll need to do so before June 22, when local clerks must begin printing absentee ballots and sending them to military or overseas voters.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nFriday, June 7\n\nMichigan’s most interesting state House races\n\nThe battle for the state House is on as Democrats defend their narrow two-seat majority and Republicans look to regain power. As part of our new Bridge Elections FAQ series, reporters Jordyn Hermani and Lauren Gibbons broke down the most interesting state House races to watch.\n\nWednesday, June 5\n\nNessel opinion tightens financial disclosure rules\n\nState elections officials can require officeholders to provide more than the bare minimum on new personal financial disclosure forms, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel determined in a formal legal opinion released Wednesday.\n\nA 2022 ballot proposal approved by Michigan voters and later written into state statute by legislators requires the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general and lawmakers to file financial disclosure statements, the first of which were due in April.\n\nAs part of those disclosures, officials were required to list their assets, liabilities, income sources, future employment agreements, gifts, travel reimbursements and more.\n\nLawmakers who finalized the rules last fall extended disclosure requirements to candidates for those same offices, but they left what critics called gaping \"loopholes\" allowing filers to obscure monetary values and other information about income sources, as well as assets held by spouses.\n\nIn the June 5 opinion, requested by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Nessel concluded that Benson can require additional identifying information about income sources, such as names and addresses associated with stock options or other unearned income.\n\n“Knowledge of public officers’ financial interests and entanglements permits the public to determine when those officers might be acting for their own gain,” Nessel wrote in the opinion. “Simply disclosing that a public officer has a ‘pension,’ ‘annuity,’ or ‘deferred compensation’ plan would not advance the purpose of the amendment.”\n\nThe opinion also allows for more specific disclosure of lobbyist gifts or charitable donations on the officeholders’ behalf. That includes making officials disclose all gifts legally required to be reported by lobbyists, even if the lobbyist failed to do so in their own reports, along with any charitable contributions a lobbyist makes in lieu of a gift to a lawmaker.\n\n\"The constitution requires more than just disclosing a 'list' of gifts and payments - it requires the disclosure of 'information,' meaning 'facts' and 'data,' regarding the gifts or patents made by lobbyists or lobbyist agents,” Nessel’s opinion reads.\n\nBenson, in a statement responding to Nessel’s opinion, said the attorney general’s opinion provides “clarity and certainty” about the new disclosure rules.\n\n“I will continue to fight for laws improving transparency and accountability in our state, limiting the influence of lobbying and financial interests, and allowing better enforcement of disclosure and ethics requirements,\" Benson said.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nTuesday, June 4\n\nBiden immigration order prompts GOP backlash\n\nAmid political pressure over the uptick in illegal crossings from Mexico, President Joe Biden signed an executive order Tuesday allowing his administration to effectively shut down the southern border when the system is “overwhelmed.”\n\nBiden’s order sparked backlash from Michigan Republicans, who argued the Democratic incumbent is doing too little and too late in an election year, and human rights advocates who claimed the decision would put lives at risk.\n\nThe order aims to bar migrants who unlawfully cross into the U.S. from receiving asylum if the crossings “exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today,” according to a White House statement.\n\nThe order will “make it easier for immigration officers to remove those without a lawful basis to remain and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents,” the Biden administration said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Biden’s order would trigger an effective border shutdown when there are a daily average of 2,500 illegal crossings. The border would reopen to asylum seekers once the average declines to 1,500.\n\nMichigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra, who is backing former President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, on Tuesday accused Biden of trying to “legitimize a system that is broken,” calling the move a “failed strategy.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township, joined Hoekstra at a morning press conference and suggested the Democratic president should consider revisiting Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy to return most asylum-seekers to that country to wait out their pending immigration cases.\n\nThe Biden campaign countered the GOP criticism by noting Trump helped torpedo a bipartisan border deal this year in Congress, claiming he “ordered his MAGA allies to kill it because he thought it would help him politically.”\n\nThat congressional plan would have added additional border agents, installed drug-detection machines and created emergency protocols for border backlogs, but fell flat after Trump and other conservatives criticized the deal in February.\n\n“Keeping our communities safe is at the bottom of Trump’s priority list while inciting chaos and division is at the top,” Alyssa Bradley, Michigan communications director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, praised Biden's order but called on Congress to \"act on legislation that will strengthen these efforts.\" Her administration will approve federal requests for Michigan National Guard deployments to the southern border, as it has done under both Trump and Biden, Whitmer added.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nThursday, May 30\n\nHarper challenges Slotkin to four U.S. Senate debates\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Hill Harper is calling for four Democratic debates before the Aug. 6 primary and criticizing his top competitor for bowing out of a planned bipartisan debate at this week’s Mackinac Policy Conference.\n\nDuring an island press conference, Harper told reporters he wants to debate Elissa Slotkin in geographically diverse parts of the state in order to get in front of as many voters as possible.\n\n“It's incumbent upon us as candidates to go everywhere across the state and inform voters,” Harper said on the porch of the Grand Hotel, where Slotkin was also meeting with conference attendees. “We should debate right now.”\n\nRelated: Stabenow not endorsing in primary as Michigan’s U.S. Senate race narrows\n\nSlotkin backed out of what was supposed to be a bipartisan Mackinac debate after Republican primary front-runner Mike Rogers declined to participate.\n\nSlotkin told Bridge Michigan Thursday that she had signed up for the Mackinac debate in April and had pushed for an alternate format after Rogers and Republican Justin Amash declined invites.\n\nShe said her campaign has reached out to Harper’s to discuss a Democratic primary debate format and would also participate in a general election debate.\n\n“I'm still ready to debate, because that's what I've always done in every race,” Slotkin said.\n\n— Lauren Gibbons\n\nWednesday, May 29\n\nTrump coming to Detroit\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is slated to return to Michigan in June, this time to speak at The People’s Conference, a three-day conservative conference in Detroit, according to organizers.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is among a handful of high-profile conservatives expected to speak at the event, which is scheduled for June 14-16 at the Huntington Place. Organizers did not immediately make clear when Trump would give remarks.\n\nOther announced speakers include ex-Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon and ex-U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat turned Independent.\n\nHosted by Turning Point Action — the campaign arm of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization advocating for conservative politics on high school, college, and university campuses.\n\nInterested parties can request tickets, which start at $50 for those age 26 and under and run up to $525 for older VIP attendees.\n\nTrump’s return to Michigan comes following campaign stops in Grand Rapids and Saginaw County, where he spoke at length on immigration and electric vehicles, respectively.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nWed.

VIP tickets, which include a picture with Lara Trump, cost $2,500 and a sponsorship is $5,000.\n\nLara Trump became co-chair for the RNC — the national party's top fundraising post — in March alongside Michael Whatley.\n\nRonna McDaniel of Michigan had led the RNC since 2017 but resigned in late February at the suggestion of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nTrump is expected to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in a rematch of the 2020 election. Biden won Michigan by 154,188 votes.\n\nThe state is one of a handful that could determine the election this fall. Both Biden and Trump campaigned Michigan this month. Biden spoke at an NAACP Dinner in Detroit, while Trump held a rally in Saginaw County.\n\nTuesday, May 28\n\nTlaib suggests voters may withhold Biden votes\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib told a crowd this weekend that voters upset with President Joe Biden’s support of Israel “aren’t going to forget this in November.”\n\nTlaib, D-Detroit, made her remarks Saturday at the People’s Conference for Palestine, a three-day event in Detroit calling for Israel to stop its offensive in the region and for “an end to all U.S. aid for Israel.” Conservative outlets have accused the conference of supporting terrorist-aligned organizations such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nAs part of her speech, Tlaib slammed both Biden “and my colleagues in Congress” for not better supporting anti-war student protests at universities across the country.\n\n“It is cowardly,” Tlaib added, “but we’re not gonna forget in November, are we?”\n\nTlaib has long been a vocal opponent of Biden’s support for Israel as it continues its war against Hamas in Gaza. She was one of the handful of elected officials to urge voting “uncommitted” in Michigan’s February presidential primary as a way to protest Israel’s ongoing war.\n\nAbout 13% of Michigan’s Democratic primary voters did end up voting “uncommitted” earlier this year, the effort seeing a large turn out in places like Dearborn and Hamtramck, cities with a heavy Muslim or Arab American populations.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nTuesday, May 28\n\nSlotkin debuts first TV ad\n\nU.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin has released her first television ad buy in her bid for the U.S. Senate, highlighting her CIA experience under the past presidential administrations of George W. Bush, a Republican, and Barack Obama, a Democrat.\n\nThe 30-second clip is part of a multi-million dollar campaign which will run on broadcast, cable, digital and specifically on Black radio stations across Michigan, according to her campaign.\n\n“For me, service is not about partisanship,” Slotkin, a Democrat running for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat, says in the ad. “It’s about doing what’s right to protect our country. … I refuse to let politics split us apart.”\n\nSlotkin is one of three Democrats running for the open seat. Others include Detroit actor and author Hill Harper and Dearborn business owner Nasser Beydoun.\n\nBeydoun’s status on the ballot could be in jeopardy after a Board of Elections review determined many of his signatures are likely invalid.\n\nRepublicans in the running include former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, physician Sherry O’Donnell, businessman Sandy Pensler and former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers.\n\n— Jordyn Hermani\n\nFriday, May 24\n\nRogers has signatures\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers has enough valid signatures to make Michigan's Aug. 6 primary ballot, but Democratic candidate Nasser Beydoun does not, the Michigan Bureau of Elections said Friday.\n\nThe bipartisan Board of State Canvassers, which is set to meet next week to certify candidate nominating petitions, will have the final word.\n\nBeydoun is one of 17 candidates the Bureau is recommending canvassers keep off the ballot because of invalid signatures, including seven candidates for U.S. House. If canvassers follow the recommendations, it would be the second major election cycle in a row where multiple Michigan candidates were disqualified.\n\nBureau staff said Beydoun shouldn't make the cut because his nominating petitions listed a P.O. Box rather than a required street address, making all signatures they reviewed invalid. Fellow Democratic Senate candidate Hill Harper had challenged Beydoun's petitions on similar grounds.\n\nFor Rogers, the frontrunner for the GOP Senate nomination, the Bureau effectively dismissed a late challenge filed by the Michigan Democratic Party and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who had claimed evidence of \"potential fraud\" on the former congressman's petitions.\n\nRogers appears to have more than enough signatures to make the ballot, the Bureau said in a report.\n\nBelow, you'll find a full list of candidates the Michigan Bureau of Elections is recommending canvassers disqualify.

They also provided declarations from six voters whose names appear on Rogers' petitions but say they never signed.\n\nThe Rogers campaign dismissed the latest Democratic letter as baseless.\n\n\"It's as illegitimate as th"
