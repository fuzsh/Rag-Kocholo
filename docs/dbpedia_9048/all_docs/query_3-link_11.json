        "text": "Stunning concoction of sundry themes worthy of accomplishing dreams by obliterating any worry, guilt and hostility outta its listeners by supplanting them with TRANQUILTY, HAPPINESS, CALMNESS, AND PROSPERITY INSTEAD!!! STARTLING JOB, UNDOUBTEDLY CAPABLE OF TEMPTING MUSICALLY ENTHUSIASTIC MOB ACROSS THE GLOBE!!! HATS OFF TO THE CADRE WHO COMPOSED THIS ALBUM TO ENJOY IT WITH CHUM(S). ü§ûüèÜü•áüíéüíÉüëè‚úå~Jaimin Shah\n\nI started working third shift a few months ago and have been listening to your calming live streams while trying to adjust to sleeping during the day. I recognize many of the songs in this collection, and am so glad to know you wrote the ones I remember and have enjoyed so much! I was privileged to hear you play live a few times (Club Soda), and hope to be able to do so again someday. You are a marvelous entertainer! Thank you for sharing your gifts and talents with the world! ~Chuck Cooper\n\nI've been too sad lately, but I just feel like finally breathing when I hear this. So calming and powerful. Thank u ‚ù§Ô∏è~Camila\n\nLove this beautiful Jazz and Chill out music and very special relaxing üòé peaceful beautiful afternoon and all my sweet relaxing üòå love ‚ù§Ô∏è always listening to this beautiful music beautiful and make me feel very relaxing üòé Chill out was the best app for my iPhone and love ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for sharing this app and love ‚ù§Ô∏è it.?! ~Yahura\n\nDear Mark, I started playing sax few months ago and I love it, but as soon as I heard about you I really discovered how I'd like to play ... maybe in another life but surely I' ll do my best ! Happy to have met you! Kind Regards, ~Teresa\n\nHi Mark well as usual really lovely I must say though that I like Blue Moon the best I have just transferred them to my I Pod so that I can listen wherever I am. With regard to the Christmas CD's can't for an excuse to play them. many thanks again for your very prompt help in getting them. ~Val Parsons, United Kingdom\n\nAww WOW Mark! I have just had my first play through of Saxomonica Blues from the CD, through proper speakers! What depth, weight and dynamics! It gave me goosebumps over and over, so much feel and emotion. I can't believe it was recorded in 2004 and I've just found it. I'm sure I'll make up for the missed years with repeated playthroughs. I'm going to struggle to get the next CD in for a while! It's great with a little power behind it, yet turn it down and it's beautiful ambience for guests. I'm going to be \"attempting\" to breathe along with it as my harp skills increase over the years. The ¬£18 Import tax was worth it for this CD alone! I have a shelf of CDs next to my player, that are never put away, as they are my life's constants (mostly Toto, Steely Dan and Donald Fagan) that shelf contents have just been increased. I hope there are new projects on the horizon. I am spreading the word to anyone I know, with the wish that this inspires more followers, sales and Saxomonica Two. Thank you Mark, it is a TRUE PRIVILEGE. ~James Walker, London, UK\n\nGood day, Mister Maxwell ... My name is Cristinel Ariton, forest engineer from Romania....in my house, my son has 16 years old and play to altosaxophone...and me, being amatour guitarist play to electric guitar...music is for us principal adventure and passion...we listen \"If you dont know me by now\" for ten thousands time...we want to buy backing track but we need full version with 5.28 min. Is possibility to have this version?...(what is guitarist name who play solo in this song?)...Congratulation for you talent!!! We expected your answer...and thank you very much... ~Cristinel Ariton, Romania\n\nMr. Maxwell: I have no idea how old you are, where you studied music, or what your other background is --- Yet, I must tell you that had you been alive and playing music 60 years ago, Thelonious Monk would have bowed to your rendition of \"Round Midnight\". You, sir, are absolutely one the Jazz Greats of our time. Thank you for the ear candy! ~Bill F.\n\nHi Mark. You're not only a gifted musician but also a Gentleman. I wish I could play the sax like you do and have your \"arranger\" skills: I appreciated your \"making of\" Games of Thrones video very much. I 'm also a smooth jazz fan and regret that this genre is not played a lot in France. That's only a few days ago that I discovered that you are THE saxophonist who is playing the subtle version of \"Sexual Healing\" that I've been listening to for a year... So I just came to know last week-end who you are and the different and brilliant aspects of your work. Keep on giving pleasure listening to your tracks. Thanks. ~Pierre\n\nI am very grateful to have found your page, the content, didactic material and backing tracks, I would like to thank you and hope you continue doing such work. Obviously I'll show it to my friends. PS: When I have money I will buy the album Saxomonica Blues to enjoy at home. Greetings from another musician in Chile! ~Benjamin"
