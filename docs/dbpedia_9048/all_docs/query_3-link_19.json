        "text": "The saxophone, an instrument combining elements of both brass and woodwind, has been a cornerstone in the world of music since its invention in 1846 by Adolphe Sax.\n\nWith its unique capabilities to mimic the human voice and its wide range of expressions, it has found a home in various genres. The true magic of the saxophone, however, lies not just in the instrument itself but in the hands of those who have mastered its art.\n\nThus in this article, let’s talk about the lives and works of 34 of the greatest and most famous saxophone players of all time, from pioneers to contemporary artists. Read on to learn more!\n\n1. Adolphe Sax\n\nThe first-ever saxophone player was the man who invented it — Adolphe Sax, a Belgian musical instrument maker in the 1800s.\n\nThe son of both mother and father instrument makers, Sax started making instruments as a young boy, making his own flute and clarinet by the age of 15 and then performing on them at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels.\n\nSax dreamt of an instrument that married the best qualities of the woodwind family of instruments with those of brass instruments.\n\nAfter four years of hard work and detailed crafting, his dream became a patented reality in 1846, and this is why saxophones are made of brass but played like a woodwind instrument with a reed.\n\n2. John Coltrane\n\nUp next is the legendary composer and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. He was influenced by the blues music of the small town he grew up in and the gospel music of his church.\n\nColtrane was self-taught and loved bebop. He worked his way up the ranks, switching from alto to tenor sax, and ended up with Miles Davis, but by 1959, he went his own way playing with his own bands.\n\nAs a sideman, he played on the Miles Davis album Kind of Blue, among lots of others. As a bandleader, some of his famous albums include Blue Trane, Giant Steps, My Favorite Things, and A Love Supreme.\n\nColtrane spearheaded avant-garde jazz and was at the height of his career when he developed liver cancer and died in 1977 at the young age of 40, leaving behind a huge legacy.\n\n3. Charlie Parker\n\nKnown as “Bird” or “Yardbird,” Charlie Parker was a trailblazer in the world of jazz, credited with the invention of bebop. He was born in 1920 in Kansas and took music lessons at public schools.\n\nAt the tender age of 11, he picked up the saxophone, and by the time he was 20, he was leading a revolution in modern jazz music. His nickname inspired some of his works, including “Yardbird Suite,” “Ornithology,” and “Bird of Paradise.”\n\nThroughout his career, Parker was known for his amazing speed and dexterity on the saxophone, playing with other jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis.\n\n4. Candy Dulfer\n\nJumping forward a few decades, we have up next the famous female saxophonist Candy Dulfer, daughter of well-known Dutch jazz tenor saxophonist Hans Duffer, who is a modern pop saxophonist from the Netherlands.\n\nCandy began playing the soprano saxophone at age six but switched to alto at age seven. By the time she was 11 years old, she played her first solo with her father’s band at the time, De Perikels (The Perils). She went on to start her own band called Funky Stuff when she was only 14 years old.\n\nIn 1990, Candy received a Grammy nomination for her very first album called Saxuality. Since then, she has played with some big names such as Madonna, Pink Floyd, and Prince.\n\n5. Sonny Rollins\n\nAt just seven or eight years old, Sonny Rollins was given an alto saxophone. He started as a pianist, played the alto sax for a while, and then switched to tenor, playing in a high school band with Art Taylor, Kenny Drew, and Jackie McLean.\n\nIn 1948, Rollins began playing professionally and made a name for himself in bebop. He recorded with Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and Thelonius Monk and made his famous album Saxophone Colossus in 1956.\n\nRollins was just not known for his playing; he was also known for his compositions, penning such classic jazz standards as “Oleo,” “St. Thomas,” and “Doxy.”\n\nHis works earned him several Grammys, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement award in 2004. Due to respiratory issues, Rollins retired in 2012.\n\n6. Stan Getz\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Stan Getz learned to play several musical instruments at a young age. His father gave him a saxophone at age 13, and Getz began practicing eight hours a day.\n\nAt 16, he joined trombonist Jack Teagarden’s band, playing with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton. In 1961, he recorded the album Focus, described as one of the great masterpieces of 20th-century jazz.\n\nIn 1972, he recorded a jazz fusion album, Captain Marvel, and later won several Grammys, one for “The Girl from Ipanema” in 1964.\n\nGetz taught at the Stanford Jazz Workshop in the mid-1980s. He died in 1991 of cancer.\n\n7. Lester Young\n\nThough he also dabbled in the clarinet, Lester Willis “Pres” Young was best known as a tenor jazz saxophonist. He was born in Mississippi into a very musical family — his father was a teacher and bandleader, and his brother Leonidas Raymond became a well-known drummer.\n\nThey moved to New Orleans, and by the time Lester was 10 years old, he had also picked up the trumpet, violin, and drums and joined the Young Family Band.\n\nLester permanently left the band at 18 years old and began playing with Art Bronson’s Bostonians. Between 1933 and 1940, he eventually found his way into Count Basie’s band.\n\nAfter leaving the Basie Band, Lester led many small groups, partnering with greats such as Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole. Interestingly, he was notorious for using a plastic saxophone reed from time to time in an attempt to create a unique sound.\n\n8. Ornette Coleman\n\nNext, we have composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, who was one of the founders of free jazz. Some of his first performances were playing in a high school band from which he was dismissed for improvising.\n\nColeman eventually abandoned bebop in favor of avant-garde jazz and switched to alto saxophone in 1949.\n\nIn 1959, his seminal album The Shape of Jazz to Come was released to critical acclaim. A year later, he released Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation, which was met with much controversy.\n\nColeman continued to play well into the 2000s, winning a Pulitzer Prize for his album Sound Grammar. He died of cardiac arrest in 2015 at the age of 85.\n\n9. Wayne Shorter\n\nBorn in 1933, Wayne Shorter started on clarinet but switched to tenor sax before studying at New York University in 1952.\n\nHe played saxophone in Miles Davis’s Second Great Quintet after playing with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers for four years. He stayed with Davis until 1970 and became a prolific composer.\n\nIn 1968, Shorter started playing the soprano sax and formed the well-known jazz fusion band Weather Report in 1970, only leaving in 1985. In 2016, he toured with Carlos Santana and Herbie Hancock in a supergroup called Mega Nova.\n\nShorter stopped playing in 2021 after winning multiple Grammys throughout his long career. To this day, he is a much-revered jazz artist.\n\n10. Grover Washington Jr.\n\nBorn and raised in Buffalo, New York, Grover Washington Jr. is thought of as one of the creators of the smooth and soul-jazz genre, along with George Benson and Wes Montgomery.\n\nThe height of Grover’s career was in the 1970s and 1980s when he wrote a lot of his own music, which became some of America’s most memorable smooth jazz pieces. His hits include “Mister Magic” and “Inner City Blues.”\n\nGrover also participated in some notable duets, such as “Just the Two of Us” with Bill Withers and “The Best Is Yet to Come” with Patti LaBelle.\n\nHe is also well known for his 1996 hit “Soulful Strut,” just three years before his death of a massive heart attack at 56 years old. He collapsed just before performing on The Saturday Early Show.\n\n11. Cannonball Adderley\n\nFrom Tampa, Florida, our next saxophonist is Julian Edwin “Cannonball” Adderley. He began playing saxophone at a very young age along with his trumpet-playing brother Nat.\n\nHis nickname, “Cannonball,” originated from “Cannibal,” which his friends called him when he was a teenager because of his massive appetite.\n\nIn 1955, he moved to New York City to try his hand at playing saxophone professionally. He formed the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, which later became the much more successful Cannonball Adderley Sextet.\n\nIn the 1960s, he began releasing albums in the emerging electric jazz genre. His quintet played at the Monterey Jazz Festival in California, a scene from which appears in Clint Eastwood’s 1971 thriller Play Misty for Me.\n\nSadly, in 1975, Cannonball passed away after a stroke caused by a cerebral hemorrhage. He was only 46 years old.\n\n12. Coleman Hawkins\n\nKnown as the Father of the Tenor Saxophone, Coleman Hawkins was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, in 1904. His musical journey began at the age of five when he started piano lessons, followed by cello, and finally saxophone.\n\nHe landed a gig with Mamie Smith’s Jazz Hounds in 1921 and later joined Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra in 1924, where he became famous for his solos and unique sound.\n\nIn 1937, he performed with Django Reinhardt and Benny Carter in Paris, and in 1939, he recorded the jazz standard “Body and Soul.” In 1944, he led the first-ever bebop recording session with Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, Don Byas, Clyde Hart, and Oscar Pettiford.\n\nHis last recording was in 1966, called Sirius. Sadly, Hawkins died of liver disease in 1969, and Sirius was later released in 1975.\n\n13. Sidney Bechet\n\nBorn in 1897 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Sidney Joseph Bechet was one of the earliest American jazz saxophonists. He played his first gigs in the early 1910s.\n\nFor the most part, Bechet taught himself to play instruments, as there were several lying around the house. He initially favored the clarinet, and at just six years old, he started playing with his older brother at a family birthday party.\n\nIt was in 1919, during a London stop of a tour, when he picked up the soprano saxophone and developed a unique style that began to set him apart in the music world. He played saxophone like he did everything else — unpredictably.\n\nThough people described him as hard to work with, nevertheless, Sydney accomplished many milestones throughout his career. Most notably, he is agreed upon as the first significant jazz soloist in America, making his first recording months before famous trumpet player Louis Armstrong.\n\n14. Paul Desmond\n\nFamed for his distinctive alto saxophone sound, Paul Desmond was a key figure in the cool jazz movement. His style of playing was fluid and airy, with very little vibrato, creating a smooth sound that became his signature.\n\nHe was also famous for writing Dave Brubeck Quartet’s hit song “Take Five.” Desmond made his mark with his years of playing in the Brubeck Quartet until 1967.\n\nHe then joined Brubeck for a tour, playing 25 shows in 25 nights around the US. Throughout his career, Desmond created a lengthy discography and served as band leader at various times.\n\nSadly, he passed away of lung cancer in 1977, after playing his final concert with Brubeck just three months prior.\n\n15. Gerry Mulligan\n\nRenowned for his baritone saxophone playing, Gerry Mulligan was an integral figure in the development of cool jazz during the 1950s. His sound was characterized by its mellowness and warmth, a stark contrast to the more aggressive styles prevalent in the era.\n\nNot only was Mulligan famous for being a leading jazz baritone saxophonist but was also a pianist, clarinetist, composer, and arranger. His songs “Five Brothers” and “Walkin’ Shoes” have become jazz standards.\n\nMulligan studied clarinet with Sammy Correnti and played the sax in local dance bands as a teenager. In 1951, he recorded Mulligan Plays Mulligan, the first album recorded under his own name. A year later, he played at sold-out performances with Chet Baker at the Haig.\n\nMulligan also appeared with Dave Brubeck in 1973 and worked with him on and off until he passed away in 1996 due to complications following knee surgery.\n\n16. Melissa Aldana\n\nCurrently only in her early 30s, Melissa Aldana is a modern tenor saxophone player from Santiago, Chile. She is the daughter of professional saxophonist Marcos Aldana, who began teaching Melissa to play the saxophone at the age of six.\n\nShe began with the alto saxophonist and was inspired by Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, and Michael Brecher. But it was hearing the work of Sonny Rollins that inspired her to begin playing the tenor saxophone.\n\nAldana currently resides in Manhattan, but she maintains her strong Chilean roots. She formed the Melissa Aldana & Cash Trio in 2012, the Melissa Aldana Quartet in 2017, and finds frequent opportunities to solo.\n\nShe was awarded the Altazor National Arts Award in Chile and the Lincoln Center’s Martin E. Segal Award, and Aldana often performs at famous jazz festivals around the world.\n\n17. Ben Webster\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Missouri, Benjamin Francis Webster was a famous American jazz tenor saxophone player.\n\nHe learned saxophone from Budd Johnson, played with Lester Young in his Young Family Band, partnered with famous jazz singer and bandleader Blanche Calloway, and joined the Bennie Moten Orchestra with Count Basie. He accomplished all this by his early 30s.\n\nIn his later career, he continued recording with jazz greats and became a soloist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra before leaving in 1943.\n\nAfter recording many hits with other jazz artists, Webster moved to Europe and played in London, Scandinavia, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen. During this period, a street was named after him in Copenhagen.\n\nInterestingly, he only played one saxophone from 1938 on. It is currently on display at the Jazz Institute at Rutgers University, and there is an order straight from Ben that it shall never be played again.\n\n18. Michael Brecker\n\nA towering figure in the world of jazz, tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker was born in 1949. Initially learning the clarinet and alto saxophone, he eventually found his true voice in the tenor saxophone.\n\nAfter playing in a few jazz groups, Brecker moved to New York in 1969, where he made a name as a jazz soloist and played with Dreams, a jazz-rock band.\n\nHe played on almost 900 albums, collaborating with artists such as Dire Straits, Aerosmith, Steely Dana and Parliament, Jaco Pastorius, George Benson, Bruce Springsteen, and Eric Clapton.\n\nAs a jazz composer and saxophonist, Brecker won multiple Grammy awards, as well as an Honorary Doctorate in Music from Berklee in 2004. That same year, he was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder and, in 2006, died from leukemia in Manhattan.\n\n19. Amy Dickson\n\nAt just the age of six, our next musician, Amy Dickson, started learning the saxophone. An Australian classical saxophone player, she made her concert debut at 16, playing the Concerto pour Saxophone Alto by Pierre Dubois.\n\nShe moved to London with a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music and became the first saxophonist to win a gold medal at the Royal Overseas League Competition.\n\nDickson has arranged works by Philip Glass and John Tavener for saxophone and commissioned new works from Ross Edwards, Huw Watkins, and Steve Martland. Between 2008 and 2019, she released eight albums and now lives in London.\n\n20. Art Pepper\n\nUp next is Art Pepper. This talented musician began playing the alto sax at the age of 13. He also played the clarinet and tenor saxophone in West Coast jazz.\n\nBy the time he was 17, Pepper was playing professionally, and he joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra, becoming recognized as one of the leading jazz saxophonists in the 1950s.\n\nPepper is known for the beauty of his melodic playing style and sensitive, gentle notes. He was recognized as second only to Charlie Parker as an alto jazz saxophonist in a 1952 poll.\n\nSadly, he passed away from a stroke in 1982, but his wife continued to put out his previously unheard material after his death.\n\n21. Arno Bornkamp\n\nA virtuoso in the classical saxophone world, Arno Bornkamp hails from Amsterdam and was born in 1959. Known for his unique presence in both the saxophone realm and the broader classical music sphere, he has carved out a distinctive career over several decades.\n\nHe made his solo debut in Rome, performing Concertina da Camera by Jacques Ibert, and has played in hundreds of concerts worldwide.\n\nHe is also a member of a Saxophone Quartet based in Amsterdam, which specializes in music from Argentine culture, including Tango, Piazzolla, folk music, and more.\n\nIn addition to his performing career, Bornkamp is an esteemed educator. He serves as a professor at the Conservatory of Amsterdam and has given several master classes worldwide.\n\n22.
