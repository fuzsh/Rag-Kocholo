        "text": "The return of the mighty David Murray and the miraculous Kahil El’Zabar.\n\nPeople get ready!\n\nWe are pleased and honored to present a return engagement by one of the towering jazz figures of our time, saxophonist David Murray, playing in a duo format with his esteemed colleague of three decades, the Chicago-based percussionist Kahil El’Zabar. Messrs. Murray and El’Zabar last performed as a duo at Bird & Beckett in April of 2017.\n\nDoors at 7:30pm; Showtime 8:00pm.\n\nTwo 50-minute sets ending at 10pm.\n\nOn the day of the show, at 7pm, we will sell 10 seats at $30 each\n\nplus 15 standing room tickets at $25 each. Cash only, please.\n\n(24 tix were sold in advance on June 1.)\n\nCapacity is 49 (35 seated).\n\nBYOB.\n\nCall 415-586-3733 for information.\n\nNo advance reservations will be taken.\n\nThanks for your consideration!\n\nA founding member of the World Saxophone Quartet, David Murray is an American jazz musician who mainly plays tenor saxophone and bass clarinet. He was initially influenced by free jazz musicians such as Albert Ayler and Archie Shepp and evolved a more diverse style in his playing and compositions. Murray set himself apart from most tenor players of his generation by not taking John Coltrane as his model. He has recorded prolifically for many record labels since the mid-1970s. He was named Village Voice Musician of the Decade, and was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship, the Grammy, and the Danish Jazzpar Prize. He has visited Pittsburgh performing with the World Saxophone Quartet courtesy of City of Asylum, as well as with the Ritual Trio featuring El-Zabar and Harrison Bankhead.\n\nKahil El’Zabar is one of Chicago’s jazz treasures. A member of the AACM, music holds no boundaries for El’Zabar, who has not only played alongside a myriad of jazz greats, but was in the bands of Stevie Wonder, Cannonball Adderley, Dizzy Gillespie, and Nina Simone (who he also designed clothes for), as well as recording with rock bands like Sonia Dada and Poi Dog Pondering. He was also chosen to do the arranging for the stage performances of The Lion King, in addition to leading his own longstanding Ethnic Heritage Ensemble and Ritual Trio. The son of a drummer, El’Zabar took to music at an early age, and was playing with members of the Art Ensemble of Chicago by his teens. He started the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble upon his return from Africa in 1973, and while the lineup has changed over time, they are still an active group. He has also released a great many albums under his own name, including a long-running relationship with Chicago’s great Delmark label. Kahil El’Zabar is not just a master percussionist- his efforts as a musician, educator, and community leader led to being named “Chicagoan of the year” in 2004 by the Chicago Tribune."
