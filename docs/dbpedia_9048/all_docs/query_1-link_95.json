        "text": "Senior adjudicator, accomplished writer and author, amateur champion piper, President of the Piobaireachd Society, Director of the Edinburgh Tattoo, Piping Convenor of the Northern Meeting, radio presenter, historian, the list of David Murray’s achievements in piping is unlikely to be surpassed, writes the Editor.\n\nMore than anything David was a real character, always entertaining company, forthright, never afraid to give his opinion or to put it down on paper; he served piping like no other.\n\nWhen I began editing the Piping Times magazine in 1999 I asked him to write a monthly column for me. This he did for 10 years, his copy immaculate, never needing amending, the content always interesting and so very well written.\n\nDavid has been immortalised in the popular reel ‘Lt. Col. DJS Murray’, originally a 4/4 march by Major John Allan. On the suggestion of P/M Angus MacDonald, Scots Guards, the tune was turned into a reel and was an instant favourite.\n\nDavid entered piping folklore in many ways. One was his description of the legend known as the Phantom Piper of the Corrieyairick. It was David who led Iain MacFadyen and his corps over this bleak pass in the Scottish Highlands, following ptarmigan through the mist and being encouraged by the distant sound of the bagpipe – only to discover on reaching camp on the other side that there was no piper – yet all in the platoon swore they had heard its reviving strains. The mystery is recalled in Captain John MacLellan’s fine piobaireachd of the same name.\n\nAnother famous occasion, often recounted in the solo piping world, was when David ordered P/M Alasdair Gillies from the Gold Medal stage at the Northern Meeting for excessive tuning. ‘Corporal Gillies! Leave the platform,’ commanded David, sending shivers down the spine of piper and audience alike.\n\nLt. Col. Murray was born in the Murree Hills in what is now Pakistan in 1921 where his father was attached to the Queen’s Own Camerons. Returning to the UK he lived for the next five years at Cameron Barracks in Inverness. On joining the HM Prison Service, his father was appointed Deputy Governor of the infamous Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow. David always felt his father’s career had been maliciously held back and he himself harboured a lifelong hatred of power misused to thwart ambition.\n\nLater the family moved to Edinburgh and David began piping at George Watson’s High School where the tutor was James Gordon, the same man who started John D. Burgess. Moving back to Glasgow he attended Glasgow High School and began lessons with Robert Reid and a lifelong love of ceol mor was kindled. Back in Edinburgh, David, at Reid’s suggestion, had tuition from P/M Willie Ross at the Castle.\n\nHe was 17 when WW2 broke out and immediately enlisted in the Royal Scots, later transferring to the Black Watch, finally being commissioned into the Queen’s Own Camerons. With them, his family regiment, he served in India, with distinction at Kohima, and later as part of the occupying force in Japan.\n\nHe was always a great champion of piping in the regiment and the Pipes & Drums knew that with him in charge they had an understanding officer who would go out of his way to make things easy for them – provided the job was done correctly and everyone was on his best behaviour.\n\nDavid’s encyclopoedic knowledge of Army piping came to the fore with the publication of his seminal work ‘Music of the Scottish Regiments’ which ran to several editions. Judging, writing, administering all became central to his interest post Army, and he brought an efficiency, sense of humour and lack of cant to everything he became involved in. Our world was the richer for David Murray’s presence, of that there can be no doubt. In his long life he made an unprecedented contribution to our music."
