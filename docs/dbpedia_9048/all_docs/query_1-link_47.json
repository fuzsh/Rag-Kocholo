        "text": "DYNAMIC DUOS | \"He brings the energy, I bring the heart\", what a quote to sum up our CEO Stephen Leeds and COO Jacquie Alley GAICD's relationship in this weeks Dynamic Duos in Mumbrella. \"Whilst attitudinally we are aligned, we bring complementary skills. Jacquie brings our business a calming and considered approach to my exuberant and fast paced style. I like to talk; she likes to write. I get energy from others; she is happy in her own company. I‚Äôm always looking for the next big idea; she gets things done quickly so we can focus on the next assignment. I like Melbourne; she likes Sydney. Maybe what brings us together is we both love a drink ‚Äì champagne, red wine or gin ‚Äì we‚Äôre totally aligned on that!\" says Stephen of Jacquie. \"Stephen has a big personality but an equally big heart and this is what I admire the most about him. He can command a room with his motivating speeches yet also shed tears when we farewell a team member. I say this all the time to him but honestly, I couldn‚Äôt imagine being on this journey with anyone else. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we have conflict and difficult conversations as it‚Äôs a ‚Äòwork marriage‚Äô but when we come back and listen to each other, we are quickly re-aligned and back to business\" Says Jacquie of Stephen. What a partnership. Thank you Mumbrella for the opportunity to showcase our leaders, culture always comes from the top down.

These lessons are valuable reminders for navigating our own lives. In our journey, it's crucial to find humor in our quirks and imperfections. Laughing at ourselves helps us embrace our uniqueness, bringing joy to our everyday experiences. Additionally, it's important to remember that not everyone will understand or appreciate our choices, passions, or professions. That's alright. Stay true to your authentic self and surround yourself with a supportive tribe that values and understands your journey. Matthew Perry's legacy extends beyond his on-screen performances. By sharing his journey in his biography and discussing his struggles, he inspired countless people to know that they are not alone in facing their challenges. Through his bravery and vulnerability, he left behind a lasting impact that continues to touch lives. Let's remember the importance of sharing our own stories and experiences, just as Matthew Perry did. By opening up about our journeys, we have the power to inspire and uplift others, reminding them that they are not alone. As we honor Matthew Perry's legacy, let's continue the conversation and share a personal story or experience that has inspired you or taught you something valuable. ‚ú® #MatthewPerry #ChandlerBing #FavoriteCharacterLessons #ShareYourStory #InspireOneAnother #MatthewPerryLegacy\n\nTime off between roles in December = A lot of time for reading. Some recommendations: ‚û°Ô∏è*The Path to Paradise: Sam Wasson‚Äôs new book on Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs life, career, and approach to film making. ‚û°Ô∏èHow to Know a Person: Among other things, how to get better at understanding another person‚Äôs perception of reality. ‚û°Ô∏èThe Color of Truth: Mainly focused on the role played by the Bundy Brothers in the Kennedy & Johnson administrations, particularly in relation to decisions on Vietnam. Up there with ‚ÄúThe Best and the Brightest‚Äù and a great examination of how strict adherence to certain mental models led extremely intelligent and rational people into making catastrophic decisions. ‚û°Ô∏èMastery: A book I wish I‚Äôd read when first published in 2012. How to uncover your ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Task‚Äù, approach the pursuit and accumulation of knowledge, and ultimately work towards Mastery in your discipline. * Caveat: Will probably result in an additional ~12-hour time investment watching/rewatching Apocalypse Now, Godfather Part 1+2 and The Conversation. #bookrecommendation #career #careerdevelopment\n\nBack at the end of 2005 I packed my life up in Wisconsin and moved to Florida with no job as I wanted something different in my life and never looked back. This brought me out of my shell of a life that I was leading at the time. Focusing on being a person that should not fear life and what it has in store for me. Fast forward, less than two years (2007) later I meet my future wife while at Disney and she convinces me to move to Alabama. (Love you Lindsey üôè) She says not to worry her father owns a business just work for him. My father in law taught me everything I need to know to be successful in that space. (Forever grateful Keith üôè) Mid 2015, the business is sold, later that year things are not going the way we all envisioned and an opportunity (thank you Rich & Ivan üôè) is put in front of me that allows me to take another risk. This is something different outside of my comfort zone as it builds me to be a better person. (thank you JP üôè) Late 2021, life says I need to take another risk and switch industries even though my wife is 8 months pregnant. (thank you Ashley & Tyler üôè). Now this opportunity has made me look deeper at myself. This has challenged me to new levels and overall making me appreciate life and everything that it has to offer. What‚Äôs next? Who knows what risks will be put in front of me. But I am not worried and afraid of the challenge. #mindset #success #positivity #growth #risk #takeachance\n\nBack at the end of 2005 I packed my life up in Wisconsin and moved to Florida with no job as I wanted something different in my life and never looked back.
