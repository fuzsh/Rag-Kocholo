        "text": "Jazz saxophonists are musicians who play various types of saxophones (alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone etc.) in jazz and its associated subgenres. The techniques and instrumentation of this type of performance have evolved over the 20th century, influenced by both movements of musicians that became the subgenres and by particularly influential sax players who helped reshape the music.\n\nIn the 1930s, during the swing and big band era, saxophonists like altoist Johnny Hodges, who led the saxophone section in the Duke Ellington Big Band, were featured soloists in a highly structured system of playing where such solos were limited moments of musical freedom.\n\nIn the early 1940s, jazz saxophonists such as Charlie Parker (alto, tenor) and Sonny Stitt (alto, tenor) led a rebellion against the strictures of big band jazz, shifting away from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music\" that would come to be called bebop, with solos that included more chromaticism and dissonance. Charlie Parker is particularly noted for his groundbreaking solo techniques that is still widely admired today. He was credited to be one of the major influences of the bebop movement.\n\nIn the 1950s, sax players like tenor saxophonist John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins broke new ground in jazz, infusing their music with rhythm and blues, modal, Latin and gospel influences as part of the hard bop subgenre.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, free jazz pioneers such as Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler developed unusual new sounds and playing styles.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Woody Herman's lead \"(Four) Brother\", Stan Getz, played cool jazz with Brazilian musicians in the emerging bossa nova style. Getz was known for his rich tone, ability to swing and impeccable technique.\n\nIn the 1970s, fusion jazz blended rock and jazz, with saxophonists like Wayne Shorter and Michael Brecker at the front of that movement.\n\nIn the 1980s, smooth jazz saxophonists such as Kenny G (Kenny Gorelick, soprano, alto, tenor), Bob Mintzer (tenor) and David Sanborn (alto, soprano) played a radio-friendly style of fusion called smooth jazz. Other notable smooth jazz saxophonists include Dave Koz, Jeff Kashiwa, and Brandon Fields.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Joshua Redman (born 1969, tenor, soprano, alto) and Chris Potter (tenor, soprano) returned to a more traditional approach which harked back to the saxophone greats of the 1950s and 1960s. Jazz saxophonist Greg Abate continues to keep bebop alive on the alto, soprano, tenor, baritone as well as the flute.\n\nNotable jazz saxophonists include:\n\nIke Quebec (1918–1963) (tenor)\n\nPaul Quinichette (1916–1983) (tenor)\n\nJazz portal\n\nMusic portal\n\nList of saxophonists"
