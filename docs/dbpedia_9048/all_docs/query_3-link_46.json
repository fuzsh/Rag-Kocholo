        "text": "There've been some recent posts about saxophone engraving and custom mouthpieces. I was cleaning my mouthpiece and wondered, would I want my name on it? Will I want to sell it some day? I doubt it, not the custom one. If my name was on it, it would be \"eternalized\" until someone threw it away. It that a good thing or a bad one\n\nAnyway, would YOU want your name engraved on a custom piece? It's discreet and would not be in the part you have in your mouth.\n\nMy most recent purchase is a \"Johnny Hodges\" model Vito Leblanc alto, which has been overhauled and now reviewed by Steve Howard: Vito Leblanc System 35 (Johnny Hodges) alto saxophone review\n\nThe original owner had it personalised with engraving of his name (\"Richard Stribling Bowers\") on the bell-bow ring and also a phrase engraved on the inside of the bell lip (\"A word softly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver\").\n\nI believe that the original owner was a \"Music-Missionary\": a pastor who played mostly jazz in church and used this saxophone for community outreach.\n\nObviously, all of his personalisation touches were very important to him, but of limited interest for me. I guess they tell us something about the history of this one instrument, but I would rather they weren't there. Perhaps they reduce the monetary value of the horn - they certainly don't increase it for me. Now if they related to Johnny Hodges himself (or Cannonball or Rollins or Hawkins) because he had owned the instrument, then it would be a different story.\n\nBut I'm sure the owner had those engravings made for himself and not because of value considerations or what possible future owners would think of them.\n\nBack to the original question: I wouldn't but I can understand why some would.\n\nRhys\n\nI bet you will sell it. Very few players stick with a mouthpiece forever.\n\nAdditionally, I have a more defined view of what really constitutes a \"Custom Mouthpiece\" that meets enough of a criteria for a signature. Its more than just variations on a theme. To be really worth thinking about having a name embossed on it I think it would have to constitute a design that was made from the ground up for you...in collaboration with you and you being part of the design process from the ground up. Then I might think about it.\n\nIn general I personally wouldnt go to the trouble ...I guess I dont see the point. A mouthpiece is a tool. Not many carpenters have their name on their hammers (except to deter other contractors with sticky fingers from stealing it)\n\nOn the flip side, unless its obnoxious I doubt it would deter many buyers though most would prefer it not be there.\n\nI would never personalize a horn in any obvious way. The value is high and it may well deter a lot of buyers. Additionally, if you have a quality instrument it will outlive you. My current horn was born the same year as me. I suspect it will outlast me, baring disaster.or my discovering the fountain of youth.\n\nI've just remembered that I've already got my name, or at least my initials, on a mouthpiece made specially for me a few years ago by Lawrie Waldron,\n\nLawrie also very kindly gave me a tenor mouthpiece he had made for Snake Davis that has something like \"Snake Special\" engraved on the table. That's another great piece.\n\nI don't think I will ever part with either of those and it's a real shame that Lawrie no longer seems to make or work on mouthpieces.\n\nRhys"
