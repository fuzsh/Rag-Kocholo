        "text": "Murray, David 01/25/1943 – 12/08/2022 David T. Murray, known to many as Slicks, Diamond Dave, Mr. D and his favorite, Poppi, passed away Thursday, December 8th, 2022 at his home in Kansas City, Missouri, from colon cancer. He was 79 years old.\n\nDavid was the fifth child born to Helena and Paul Murray in Denver, Colorado. A lifelong learner and notable class clown, Dave graduated from Regis High School in 1961. He then headed west to attend the University of Portland, for his undergrad followed by The University of Colorado for his Master’s Degree. Foregoing law school, Dave took the road less traveled and enlisted in the Army. Two years later, he married the love of his life, and high school sweetheart, Pam.\n\nDave’s pride and joy was his family. He is survived by his wife, Pam, two daughters, Erin Murphy (son-in-law Stephen Murphy) and Maury Ankrum (son-in-law Matt Ankrum) and his five grandchildren, Rylan, Madigan, Peyton, Morgan and Pierce, sister Adele Deline (husband Bill), and many nieces, nephews and dear friends.\n\nDave was a man of many talents. With his charisma and knack for business, it was natural that he would become a gemologist and enter his wife’s family jewelry business that he carried on for 32 years.\n\nDave’s retirement was far busier than his working years. He kept active as an avid golfer, volunteer with St. Vincent de Paul, and flower delivery boy for his daughter’s gift shop. For all those who knew him, it will surprise no one that he found great fun teaching other guests how to do the Macarena on a Mexican beach, surviving a deer sighting and related accident on a golf course, spelunking underwater in the Virgin Islands, zip-lining for the first time in his seventies and engaging in deep conversations with complete strangers.\n\nDavid Murray will forever be one of the most inquisitive, charitable and funniest men who graced this earth. He will be missed dearly.\n\nA funeral will be held at Good Shepherd Church, 2626 E. 7th Ave Pkwy, Denver, CO 80206 on January 25, 2023 at 1:00 pm."
