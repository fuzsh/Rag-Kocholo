My old Gretsch 6120 I call Gretchen, A few years ago, I was playing with an older gentleman who played a vintage Martin sax that his mother had bought him brand new in 1949. He named the sax Margaret after his mother. I then decided to name my 1926 Conn New Wonder Series II Lois after my grandmother who was born in 1926. I named my 1948 Conn 10M naked lady Betty. There was an elderly lady named Betty whom I met in a nursing home a few years ago. Betty was known to walk out of her room often wearing very little if any clothing! Interesting question though!

For some reason, \"give me Mothra\" was easier for them to understand than \"hand me my alto\"...I never liked to keep a bunch of horns on stage since they tend to get knocked over by people running around, so having a system for the crew to follow worked out pretty well.\n\nReply To Post\n\nby chalazon\n\n(547 posts)\n\n16 years ago\n\nRe: What's your sax's name?\n\nmy tenor's name is Bob.
