        "text": "Award-winning David Murrayâs talent is expressed in a prolific career in both production and musical direction (from the World Saxophone Quartet to his big band and the Caribbean jazz fusion of the Gwo Ka Masters). alongside the greatest musicians.\n\nWith his quartet Infinity, named in memory of his early New York years in the loft-studio Infinity, the saxophonist invites the voice of Saul Williams, a committed and unclassifiable figure on the New York scene. Multi-faceted artist â poet, writer, rapper, actor â Saul Williams cites from among these sources of inspiration names as diverse as Tupac Shakur, Prince, Jean-Michel Basquiat, James Baldwin, the writers of the Beat Generation or BeyoncÃ©.\n\nJoined by Nasheet Waits, Orrin Evans and Jaribu Shahid, the quintet-turned Infinity develops an intense and out of the genre music, between abrasive jazz and inhabited spoken word."
