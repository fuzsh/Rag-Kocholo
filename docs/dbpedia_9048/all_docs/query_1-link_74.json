        "text": "Well known for his signature cast glass pieces, David Murray has won significant national and international awards including the prestigious Ranamok Prize, Australia.\n\nWith a signature graduated colour and density, his simple yet powerful pieces examine sculptural scale suggesting contradictory elements of fragility and strength.\n\nHis large substantial Hunter, Gatherer and Territory series pieces, constructed from a single curved slab of opulent glass are a subtle reflection of the landscape. In his Territory pieces for instance, the restrained organic curvature of form rises to opposing jagged peaks emulating a craggy landscape while also providing us with a sense of action and an awareness of the maker. Murray regularly plays with the exterior planes, one side of his glass could be smoothed to a high polish while on the opposing side undulating ridges and grooves create surface tension akin to strata or a lava current giving the impression of inner movement and turmoil.\n\nMurray explains 'My work uses simple ambiguous shapes and the qualities of the glass to create a sense of these fundamental stimuli. They are neither tool nor weapon but describe a feeling of intent make simple minimal forms without embellishment. These are large solid pieces and I am trying to achieve a silent presence in the work.'\n\nDimensions: H: 480 x W: 300 x D: 200mm"
