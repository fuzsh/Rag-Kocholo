        "text": "David Murray (1842—1928) was a well-known figure in Victorian Glasgow. He was a prominent Glasgow solicitor closely involved in various aspects of the city’s civic life and institutions, including the University of Glasgow, where he served on the University court. When not active in his day job he was a keen antiquarian and a published historian. He is now perhaps best remembered for the important 15,000 volume personal library (largely works on the history of Glasgow and legal history) bequeathed to the University of Glasgow.\n\nTo celebrate Murray’s life and his book collecting, James Hamilton, Research Principal of the WS Society (i.e. The Society of Writers to HM Signet) will be delivering a West End Festival talk entitled ‘Legal Bibliophilia in the Dear Green Place: Dr David Murray’s lost law archive and his Glasgow 1860-1928’. The free talk will take place at 5.15pm on 5th June 2019 in the University of Glasgow Library, and will include a wine reception generously sponsored by Denton’s, successor to Murray’s own law firm, and a display of rare and interesting books from his library now held by the University of Glasgow Library Archives & Special Collections (including unique hand-coloured manuscripts illustrating different aspects of Glasgow’s history, incunabula (15th-century printed books) and other highlights of his antiquarian book-collecting).\n\nAll are welcome. Tickets should be booked in advance from the West End Festival site.\n\nCategories: Archives and Special Collections"
