        "text": "Charles Parker, Jr. (August 29, 1920 â March 12, 1955) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer.\n\nParker, with Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, is largely considered one of the most influential of jazz musicians. Parker acquired the nickname \"Yardbird\" early in his career,and the shortened form \"Bird\" remained Parker's sobriquet for the rest of his life, inspiring the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as \"Yardbird Suite\", \"Ornithology\" and \"Bird of Paradise.\"\n\nParker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat generation, personifying the conception of the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual, rather than just a popular entertainer. His style â from a rhythmic, harmonic and soloing perspective â influenced countless peers on every instrument. Source: Wikipedia\n\nStanley Gayetzky or Stanley Gayetsky (born February 2, 1927 â June 6, 1991), usually known by his stage name Stan Getz, was an American jazz saxophone player. Getz was known as \"The Sound\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow tone of his idol, Lester Young. Source: WIKI\n\nStan Getz was a tenor saxophonist of the first rank who, while exploring and pursuing a purity of musical expression, maintained a large following. He attracted it early in his career with his recording of \"Early Autumn\" with the Woody Herman band in 1948, more or less sustained it during the Fifties (which were not always tranquil times for him), and then, in the early Sixties, expanded it as he helped introduce Brazilian bossa nova rhythms to jazz. With \"Desafinado\" and other tunes, Getz established a sound and a beat that appeared and soared on the charts that rank recordings by the number sold. Source: VerveMusicGroup"
