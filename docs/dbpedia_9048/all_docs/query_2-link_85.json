Following the great success of his previous project, ‘Nat King Cole En Español’, Murray will come to the Bimhuis with three top musicians from New York and a brand new repertoire. Black Music Infinity is inspired by the forward-thinking New York loft jazz scene, which Murray was part of in the 1970s.\n\nFEAT. MARC CARY, JARIBU SHAHID, HAMID DRAKE\n\nDavid Murray tenor saxophone, Marc Cary piano, Jaribu Shahid bass, Hamid Drake drums"
