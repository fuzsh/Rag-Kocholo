        "text": "Sax-a-Boom is a children's toy instrument that is frequently adopted by Jack Black at live Tenacious D concerts. It resembles a saxophone, and has a musical loop on each of its eight buttons.\n\nIt is now discontinued, but it was designed in or around 1998 by Shoot the Moon II LLC and manufactured by DSI Toys Inc. Despite being branded as \"Kawasaki,\" the toy has nothing to do with the Kawasaki Motors Corp. DSI Toys held the official license to produce toy vehicles with 'Kawasaki' on them, and used 'Kawasaki' branding on other toys they produced. DSI Toys would cease operations in 2003, whilst Shoot the Moon still owns the 'Sax-a-boom' license. Meaning the Sax-a-Boom could be brought back into production if a manufacturer were interested.\n\nThe Sax-a-Boom was released as part of the Kawasaki Rockers Band.\n\nTrivia[]"
