        "text": "David Murray believes strongly in the rights of landowners. He attended law school with the intent to spend his career ensuring his clients receive just compensation when their property is affected by a taking. Since beginning his career in 2008, David has represented landowners exclusively (never the government) and obtained millions of dollars in increased compensation for clients over the initial offers made by condemning authorities (often called condemnors). He has also obtained a significant number of variances and rezonings for landowners so that they may maximize the use of their property. He has never wavered in his dedication to landowners like you. David is known among his peers as the go-to attorney in Charlotte for matters involving eminent domain, land condemnation, zoning and land law and has been recognized as a top lawyer in North Carolina in these practice areas.\n\nDavid has experience not only in representing landowners in trial courts seeking to obtain enforcement of property rights and payment of just compensation, but also in appealing or defending landowners in cases before the North Carolina appellate courts. He also regularly appears before local zoning boards and commissions to represent landowners in seeking to maximize the use of their properties.\n\nEducation\n\nB.A., Political Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2005\n\nJ.D., North Carolina Central University of Law, magna cum laude, 2008\n\nExecutive Editor, Journal of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Law, 2007-2008\n\nMoot Court Board, 2007-2008\n\nProfessional Licenses"
