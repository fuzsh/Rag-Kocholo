        "text": "David Murray\n\nThis page features a series of posts on the jazz saxophonist David Murray. It’s part of a long-term project to chronicle and analyse Murray’s work. If you’re a Murray fan I hope you find what I have to say straightforward and interesting, even if some of it is written for academic publication.\n\nFirstly, there’s the drafts to a fairly lengthy analysis of Murray’s career. This is followed by analyses of his recorded output. I’ve identified getting on for 200 LPs, so it’s going to take time to build up the complete set. After that there’s some posts on rather random aspects of Murray’s career usually written in response to assumptions about Murray’s career that I find unconvincing. As I get round to it you’ll also be able to read some interviews with people who offer interesting insights into Murray’s career.\n\nDavid Murray: the making of a progressive jazz musician\n\nThese are drafts of an article that should be coming into publication soon. They aren’t polished, finished pieces, but the final article needed cutting down, so these drafts often feature lengthier sections on matters that interest me, even if the overall argument is harder to follow.\n\nFirst here’s a discussion of the idea of progress in jazz discourse using David Murray (and a comparison with Coleman Hawkins) as an example.\n\nColeman Hawkins and David Murray, and the idea of the progressive musician\n\nThe next three links are to a full version of the article, which extends and distills earlier drafts. This is not the final version, which has now been published in the Jazz Research Journal. If you want more detail on some aspects it is worth reading the drafts as well.\n\nJust click on the link to go to the topic.\n\nDavid Murray: the making of a progressive jazz musician (Part One)\n\nDavid Murray: the making of a progressive jazz musician (Part Two)\n\nDavid Murray: the making of a progressive jazz musician (Part Three)\n\nBibliography\n\nThe drafts:\n\nDavid Murray Part One\n\nDavid Murray Part Two\n\nDavid Murray Part Three\n\nIf you want to find out more the bibliography should give you plenty more to read.\n\nDavid Murray – I am a Jazzman\n\nInformation of a French TV documentary about Murray.\n\nDavid Murray’s recorded output\n\nMy ultimate aim here is to produce a detailed survey of Murray’s whole recording career. You’ll find surveys of different decades of his work, and I’m building up a series of posts based upon close analysis and contextual discussion of his recordings. I’m starting with the earlier and hard to find releases.\n\nI’ve also posted the first of a series of guides to Murray’s prodigious output if you want to buy and listen to more. I’ll extend and add to them over time. Here’s what’s available so far:\n\nA listener’s guide to David Murray’s records in the 1990s\n\nI’ve been collecting Murray records for a few decades now, and recently I came to believe that had had all but a few of his recordings as leader or co-leader. This is quite an achievement because there are around 150 of them. You can count down the final additions to my Murray record collection through these posts:\n\n150\n\n151\n\nThe records\n\nTed Daniel: In The Beginning (featuring David Murray) 1975\n\nLive At The Peace Church 1976\n\nFlowers For Albert 1976\n\nLive At The Lower Manhattan Ocean Club Vol.1& 2 1977\n\nSolomon’s Sons 1977\n\nConceptual Saxophone 1978\n\ntrack by track: ‘Home’ ‘Come Sunday’ ‘Flowers for Albert’\n\nOrganic Saxophone 1978\n\nSur-Real saxophone 1978\n\nLast of the Hipman 1978\n\nWilber Morris / David Murray / Dennis Charles: Wilber Force 1983\n\nClarinet Summit In Concert at the Public Theater Vol. I/II 1984/5\n\nKahil El’Zabar with David Murray Golden Sea 1989\n\nDavid Murray & Milford Graves: Real Deal 1992\n\nPopular misconceptions\n\nYou can also read about Murray’s comments about Albert Ayler as an influence (he isn’t much of one) in a series of posts\n\nDoes Flowers for Albert suggest Murray was influenced by Ayler?\n\nFlowers for Albert (reprised)\n\nMisunderstanding Flowers for Albert\n\nFlowers for Albert (yes again)\n\nInterviews\n\nI have conducted a series of interviews with people involved in Murray’s career. As I write them up you’ll be able to read them here:"
