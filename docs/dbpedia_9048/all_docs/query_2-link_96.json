        "text": "For decades, saxophonist David Murray was a presence in New York City both imposing and prodigious, a hugely talented performer who also collaborated and composed at an astonishing rate. He's now based in Europe, but in early 2015, the Winter Jazzfest — a concert happening which celebrates the depth and breadth of the jazz community — booked him in a way that seemed appropriate to this history: three different sets with three different bands.\n\nJazz Night In America speaks to Murray and gathers the story behind these three projects — three of many. We hear a revival of the four-man \"clarinet summit\" bands he first played in decades ago, featuring Don Byron, David Krakauer and Hamiet Bluiett; a new collaborative trio with heavy hitters Terri Lyne Carrington (drums) and Geri Allen (piano); and a quartet performance spotlighting the performance poet Saul Williams."
