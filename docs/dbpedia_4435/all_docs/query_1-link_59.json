        "text": "Electronic transport in materials is governed by a series of tensorial properties such as conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and effective mass. These quantities are paramount to the understanding of materials in many fields from thermoelectrics to electronics and photovoltaics. Transport properties can be calculated from a material&#39;s band structure using the Boltzmann transport theory framework. We present here the largest computational database of electronic transport properties based on a large set of 48,000 materials originating from the Materials Project database. Our results were obtained through the interpolation approach developed in the BoltzTraP software, assuming a constant relaxation time. We present the workflow to generate the data, the data validation procedure, and the database structure. Our aim is to target the large community of scientists developing materials selection strategies and performing studies involving transport properties.\n\nTight-binding models provide a conceptually transparent and computationally efficient method to represent the electronic properties of materials. With AFLOWpwe introduce a framework for high-throughput first principles calculations that automatically generates tight-binding hamiltonians without any additional input. Several additional features are included in AFLOWp with the intent to simplify the selfconsistent calculation of Hubbard U corrections, the calculations of phonon dispersions, elastic properties, complex dielectric constants, and electronic transport coefficients. As examples we show how to compute the optical properties of layered nitrides in the AMN2 family, and the elastic and vibrational properties of binary halides with CsCl and NaCl structure. 2017 Elsevier B.V.
