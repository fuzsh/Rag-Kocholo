        "text": "Back to Laser and Parts Sources Sub-Table of Contents.\n\nWhere to Find Laser Equipment and Parts\n\nSources for Everything from $5 Laser Diodes to $100,000 C02 Laser Welders\n\nA large number of companies sell lasers, laser components, and related optics to the hobbyist and experimenter. As with everything else these days, the trend is toward putting their catalogs on the Web, in some cases complete with photos of each item. There is a fairly wide range of prices so shopping around is recommended. At least, your mouse can often to the walking. The quality from places like Edmund Scientific is very high but you pay for it. For many purposes, much cheaper alternatives are available.\n\nIt is also possible to buy from private individuals on-line via classified ads in USENET newsgroups, other discussion groups and bulletin boards, auctions, and private Web sites.\n\nWhere actual manufacturer's model numbers are listed in the catalog or on the Web page, it is a good idea to confirm that the specifications actually do match. Inaccuracies in catalog entries are very common (like a HeNe laser listed as 5 mW that turns out to be only .5 mW, oops). Similarly, it would be disappointing to say the least if you blew a visible laser diode because the driver board actually required a regulated input when the listing claimed otherwise. :-(\n\nCompare prices as well. There can be a wide variation in the price of the identical system or component among the various surplus houses or other suppliers. Haggling (at least with private individuals) may get you a better deal especially if you can identify lower prices elsewhere. More expensive items may be in better condition or newer, but not always - and it may not matter for your purposes. Consider using COD (Cash On Delivery) for payment if available (instead of a check, money order, or credit card) when dealing with a company for the first time or when in doubt about their integrity. For purchases from individuals, in addition to COD, a partial payment arrangement (e.g., 50% percent up front, 50% after receipt and inspection of merchandise) shouldn't scare off someone who has nothing to hide if they can verify *your* integrity. The latter shouldn't be a problem if you are a regular contributer to USENET newsgroups or frequent buyer and/or seller on eBay! :)\n\nA commercial supplier should know how to pack and ship fragile merchandise to prevent damage. However, when ordering from a private individual or if you should need to send laser parts through the mail, or via UPS, Fed-X, Airborn, etc., packing should be done such that the box can withstand being drop-kicked from a 10 story building. Four inches of bubble-wrap or styrofoam peanuts on all sides should be considered a minimum with adequate protection between items as well. Insurance is also a worthwhile expense though successfully filing a claim could be an ordeal. Stickers marked 'Fragile' and 'Do Not Drop' may just make the package a more inviting target. :-)\n\nThen, when you receive your merchandise, make sure you actually were sold what was expected. Confirm that it behaves as advertised. I have received HeNe laser power supplies marked with reversed polarity, for example. Honest (or otherwise) mistakes in packing and labelling do occur. And, of course, DO NOT open the inner packaging or attempt to power an item that was shipped in error as getting a refund may be much more difficult if the seller can honestly claim you damaged something.\n\nI've only had to file an insurance claim once, with the U.S. Post Office (USPS). That was for a 15 to 20 mW HeNe laser head I had gotten along with a power supply on eBay. The bore of the laser head was fractured, most likely due to the package falling onto a concrete floor. (The power supply was not damaged.) From my perspective, the packing was not totally adequate but would have been fine for ordinary handling, even tossing it onto a pile of boxes. Thus, I would have not been terribly unhappy to have the the claim denied with an excuse of \"inadequate packing\". Then, I would go back to the seller and it is likely we would have come to some acceptable agreement. However, I filled out the claim form, obtained the insurance receipt and an itemized cost receipt from the seller, and included a description along with a diagram of the damage. I went into my local post office with these as well as the box and all packing material, the broken laser head partially disassembled so the damage could be easily seen, and a mockup of the power supply to show how everything was arranged. Since the claim was for only $50, they paid it on the spot. It turns out that $50 is the USPS limit for this - otherwise it would have had to go through the system, with an uncertain and no doubt long time to completion. (I did forgo reimbursement for part of the shipping cost but figured that a bird in the hand.....) Aside from just getting in under the instant payment limit in this case, one key to getting an insurance claim paid without hassle is no doubt having all the original packaging and complete documentation to present when filing the claim. And, with the value only being $50, I was dealing with a PO clerk, who had no vested interest in minimizing the cost to USPS or receiving bonuses based on the dollar value of rejected claims! :)\n\nAlso see the sections: Laser Sales and Service Companies and Laser and Optics Manufacturers and Suppliers for sources of mostly expensive laser products. However, some of those companies may have overstock and surplus sales as well as items like diode laser modules that are more reasonably priced.\n\nLocating Laser Specifications\n\nIt is often difficult to determine the capabilities of a particular model laser in terms of wavelength and power output based on a single catalog listing or description alone. (For testing of an laser you have, see the chapter(s) for that specific laser type.)\n\nObviously, for a model that is still being sold, the manufacturer's literature or Web site will often provide enough info. User and service manuals may also be available as well as for older lasers that they still support. In addition, there may be many variations on a given model depending on the type of optics installed and possible tube replacement or upgrade.\n\nUnfortunately, few manufacturers maintain detailed specifications or other information readily accessible (e.g., on-line) for older models. After all, why should they help you fix the laser that you've been happy with for the last 5 years for only $500 when they can sell you a shiny new and improved one for $20,000! :(\n\nThere are a variety of other places to look for specifications but their accuracy can vary based on the objectives of the provider (e.g., honesty, vested interests, optimism, technical knowledge).\n\nVintage Lasers and Accessories Brochures has scans of older catalogs, specifications sheets, and price lists, from several popular manufacturers (mostly HeNe lasers at present).\n\nCompanies that sell used or surplus laser equipment - If the model in question is in their catalog, the information you seek may be there. For example, Laser Resale, Inc has extensive listings for virtually all types of laser systems. Many others can be found in the sections: Mail Order - Lasers, Laser Parts, Optics, Accessories and Laser Sales and Service Companies.\n\nJust keep in mind that these are items for sale so power output ratings must be taken with a sliver of optical glass (at least for lasers like ion and ruby/YAG where output power is adjustable).\n\nCompare info from multiple sources if possible - the more agreement there is, the higher the probability that the information is correct.\n\nAlso see the section: Buyer Beware for Laser Purchases.\n\nBuyer Beware for Laser Purchases\n\nIn perusing the various laser offerings from time-to-time at the eBay Auction Site as well as the on-line or print catalogs of various surplus outfits, it very often seems that given the model or size of the laser, the claimed power output ratings are considerably higher than what may be realistic while still achieving a reasonable system lifetime, or are not possible at all. The most common error (intentional or not) is to use the CDRH safety sticker value rather than the manufacturer's or measured power output in the description of the laser. This is an upper bound - the actual capability can be anything lower! And, even if the seller states that they measured the actual output power, there's no guarantee that their laser power meter was calibrated within the last century or that they knew how to use it properly!\n\nHere are some comments on laser power and other claims that you should be aware of before purchasing a used laser:\n\nHelium-Neon (HeNe) lasers: The power discrepancy is particularly evident with HeNe lasers where the model number and/or dimensions are provided. The tendency seems to be - possibly due to lack of knowledge, possibly for other reasons - to use the CDRH safety sticker rating (which is an upper bound for the laser safety classification) rather than the actual measured or specified optical power. Sometimes they do say 'max' (possibly in the fine print). This doesn't mean it is (or ever was) possible to run the laser at that power, and the actual output may be less than half of the maximum value listed (assuming the laser is functioning near its new product ratings). HeNe tubes are essentially constant optical output power devices - there is no way to get more power either with greater tube current (beam power actually goes down) or by using pulsed drive. For example, a HeNe laser with a CDRH Class IIIa 5 mW sticker may produce as little as 1 mW when new and even less after thousands of hours of use! A true 5 mW HeNe laser head will be at least 15 inches long and have a Class IIIb safety sticker. A classic defense of using the 'max' rating is to say that \"the laser was spec'd as (say) 5 mW and thus calibrated at the factory for this power level but could go much higher\". Balderdash! The only way to trim power of an HeNe laser (without an external attenuator) is to (1) run it with reverse polarity to sputter overcoat the anode-end mirror (which is irreversible) or (2) to slightly misalign one or both mirrors (which would compromise beam quality and stability and isn't likely to be done on purpose). Having said that, it is true that slight misalignment of the mirrors is common (either from use, thermal cycling, shock, or less than perfect quality control at the factory) and boosting power by some (usually modest) amount may be possible, even likely, by tweaking the mirrors - just don't count on it - or on a huge increase. But, first see the sections starting with: Problems with Mirror Alignment because it is very easy to totally mess up the alignment (or even break the tube) and never see any coherent light from your buy of a lifetime HeNe laser forever-after!\n\nNote that there are some multi-mode (non-TEM00) HeNe tubes with wider bores and a different mirror curvature that produce up to perhaps twice the power output for a given tube length. However, with multiple axial modes, these are not suitable for many applications like interferometry and holography. They are also not very common compared to single-mode TEM00 HeNe tubes.\n\nAlso, the power output of non-red HeNe lasers - green (543.5 nm), yellow (593.9 nm), and orange (611.8 nm) - will be only about 1/10th to 1/4th that of an equivalent red (632.8 nm) one. Thus, a 20 inch green laser head is good for about 2 mW (compared to 8 to 15 mW for red) and a 10 inch head, perhaps only .2 mW (1 to 2 mW for red). As with normal red HeNe lasers, there is no way to boost power and the CDRH sticker rating is normally much greater than what is actually possible. However, the beam WILL look a lot brighter mW/mW compared to red due to the response curve of the eye, which can be misleading to sellers and buyers alike.\n\nNote: Since the gain of these wavelengths is so low, they also have a shorter life and the chance of finding working surplus green or yellow HeNe lasers is much lower than for red. I would not recommend bidding on an eBay auction for one of these unless guaranteed to be working. The likelihood of the problem for an \"unknown condition\" green or yellow HeNe laser being just mirror alignment is small to none!\n\nAnd, just because the male Alden connector of the laser head fits into the mating female socket of a randomly selected power supply doesn't mean they will work together! HeNe lasers of all sizes usually use the identical connectors! (Many people have been known to throw out perfectly good HeNe tubes and heads if they failed to start or operated erratically when in fact, power supply compatibility was the real problem!) On the other hand, don't assume compatibility just because the laser tube or head and power supply were supposed to work together - many of these same people have no idea what this means and make the assumption that because the laser worked once (if that), it would be fine forever. The life of the HeNe tube and/or power supply may be shortened and/or power output may suffer.\n\nLarge-frame HeNe lasers like the Siemens LGK-7676/L/S and functionally similar Spectra-Physics 107/907 which show up on eBay and from surplus dealers either untested or without measured output power are probably high mileage tubes which may run but will not meet new power specs. However, they are very well built, really nice to play with, and probably have a lot of life left. Just don't expect good as new performance from them. Around 50 percent of rated power is typical.\n\nFinally, HeNe laser heads in like-new condition that show up as surplus or on eBay without end-caps (output aperture and Alden connectors) were probably manufacturing rejects pulled from the line before being completed since they didn't meet spec in any of a number of areas including: output power value, stability with warmup, mode cycling percentage, polarization ratio, or other aspects of beam quality. Thus, what you end up with may have undisclosed problems. This is also likely true of bare HeNe tubes (often without any identifying labels) - especially 'other color' (than red) types in pristine condition but where the locking collars or mirror adjusters are loose and the seller suggests that \"alignment is all that is needed to make them lase and then you will have gotten a great deal\". Note that it is likely that some of these have found their way to resale via less than legitimate channels - especially if the serial numbers have been removed! Even if they do work or can be made to work, items like this have trouble written all over them. And, don't believe claims that tubes were \"purchased new and used very little\" if they don't have any labels. A tube sold as a tube (not part of a laser head) will almost certainly be labeled with model and serial numbers at the very least, usually with a sticker on the side. Similarly, a laser head should also have a similar label. It's the law in both cases. And, even the manufacturer can't tell specs by inspection! :)\n\nHaving said all this, a used or off-spec HeNe laser may still be just fine for many purposes as long as you understand exactly what you are getting. For more information on HeNe laser sizes and power output, see the sections starting with: Internal Mirror HeNe Tubes up to 35 mW - Red and Other Colors. And some have very interesting and unusual behavior. :)\n\nArgon and/or krypton (Ar/Kr) ion lasers: It is much more difficult to determine actual ratings of small air-cooled Ar/Kr ion lasers based on size alone because the output from the same size laser head can span a range of 100:1 or more depending on specific model, age, operating current, or condition. The advertisement may specify the output when running at a current level that would result in a tube life of only a few hours or one not even obtainable with a typical power supply.\n\nAlso see the section: Expected Output Power and Used Ion Lasers.\n\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) lasers: For CO2 and other gas lasers where models are even less well known and physical size may be an even less reliable indication of capabilities, examining a photo on a Web page or in a catalog isn't enough. And, damage or deterioration of the laser tube, water jacket, or optics cannot be determined without a detailed (in person) inspection.\n\nDiode lasers: There is often even less info available on these unless they are from a well known laser company distributor like Edmund Scientific. Both wavelength and color may be optimistically specified. For example, laser pointers listed as 650 nm may actually be much closer to 660 nm which does not appear as bright and is therefore less desirable. The absolute maximum output power may be advertised but a laser diode really cannot be run at this level without a proper driver circuit, cooling, and a calibrated laser power meter to set it up - else bye-bye laser diode. :( And, the power ratings on the CDRH sticker, if it exists, may be grossly higher than what is possible even for a microsecond.\n\nI would recommend against even considering the purchase of high power diode lasers or laser diodes from eBay or other similar source unless they are supplied in their original sealed packaging, there is a no questions asked money back warranty that is enforceable, or you know the seller to be honest and aware of proper handling procedures for laser diodes. If you insist on bidding on one of these, compare the any specifications provided by the seller with the device's datasheet if possible. Sometimes, very professional looking charts will be included on the auction page without mentioning that they show a weak or damaged diode.\n\nNote that there are several sellers offering what they claim to be high power laser diodes suitable for DPSS laser pumping where a wavelength in the 808 to 810 nm range is needed. However, many of the surplus high power laser diodes originate from graphics arts equipment like platesetters which almost invariably use 820 to 880 nm diodes, most likely for cost reasons. So, an unscrupulous or unknowledgeable seller may be passing these off as DPSS laser pump diodes when in fact they are pretty worthless for that application. In fact, the only hobbyist use I know for these would be as burning lasers since the beam can be focused very nicely to carve wood or plastic or an unsuspecting finger. :( :) If what you're interested in is a diode pump for a DPSS laser, make sure the seller guarantees the wavelength to be close enough to 808 nm that modest cooling or heating (+10/-15 °C from 25 °C based on 0.3 nm/°C can tune the wavelength to the optimum value for peak absorption in the lasing crystal (usually, Nd:YVO4 or Nd:YAG). Just showing a photo of one of these diodes producing green light from a DPSS laser crystal is not a sufficient test as there may be some output but it will be only a small fraction of what's possible with a diode emitting at 808 nm. Some sellers claim to have gotten significant green power from a DPSS laser crystal using diodes that look identical. My guess is that either (1) they were smoke'n sump'n or (2) the particular diode they were using was actually around 808 nm but that's no guarantee that the one in the auction will be as well.\n\nLamp Pumped Solid State (LPSS) lasers: Likewise, for pulsed or CW LPSS lasers provided as kits of parts (which is probably most common for types like Nd:YAG or ruby other than the M60 rangefinder), be aware that some surplus laser parts suppliers are offering components that simply will not work as advertised. See the section: Comments on Surplus Solid State Lasers and Components for additional details.\n\nWhere an entire LPSS laser head or complete laser is offered, the only way to really know what is can do is to check the manufacturer's specs or test it. In most cases, the seller isn't able or won't do this so you're on your own.\n\nDiode Pumped Solid State (DPSS) lasers have all the potential problems of both diode lasers and solid state lasers so the comments above apply. In addition, it is quite likely that a complete DPSS laser being offered on eBay - especially with a low opening bid or low reserve - if it works at all, is likely to have end-of-life pump diodes and thus reduced output power and poor stability. Green DPSS lasers like the Coherent Compass 532 series show up with reduced output requiring either an expensive (and possibly very complex or impossible) pump diode transplant to meet specs, or a total electrical realignment to operate stably at reduced power. Those like the Coherent Compass 315M and 415M often are sold without the ($2K) Coherent controller. Both of these require a laser diode driver and three (3) TEC drivers to achieve their rated output power and stability - not something for a casual hobbyist type to construct. Unless the condition and requirements for a DPSS laser can be reliably determined, such a system could turn out to be entirely useless for serious applications including holography and laser shows.\n\nFurthermore, as with other types of lasers, the CDRH rating is almost always much higher than anything that can be achieved and sustained in practice. For example, Coherent C315M-100 lasers have a \"300 mW max\" rating and Uniphase uGreen 4601-10, -20, and -50 lasers have a \"125 mW\" max rating. Realistic maximum output power is not likely to exceed 1/3 to 1/2 of either of these and may be much less in the case of the lower power uGreen lasers.\n\nFor more info, also see the section: About Laser Power Ratings.\n\nAttempt to determine what is actually possible - don't take the seller's word for it. You can't confirm actual output over the Internet or from a catalog but at least you will know that you aren't likely to get 5 mW from a HeNe laser head only 10 inches long, 300 mW from a surplus ALC-60X argon ion laser without a meltdown, or 125 mW from *any* Uniphase uGreen laser!\n\nMany people also claim that the lasers they are selling have low hours or were only used briefly a few times (\"only driven by a little old lady to church on Sundays.\"). In most cases they actually don't have a clue and such claims carry about as much weight as the campaign promises of politicians. :) Unless the laser was originally purchased new, they (or you) may have no real way of determining how much it was used. For HeNe lasers, this may not matter that much since if the laser works when you get it, it will probably continue to work for as many hours as you are likely to care. But for ion lasers, you could be getting a low pressure tube that is on its way out. While there is usually an elapsed time meter present on ion lasers it isn't a reliable indication of past use as the tube may have been swapped or a mechanical meter may have recycled back to zero (more than once!) and like automobile odometers, can be reset. With other types of lasers, it may be even more difficult to determine the amount of use. High power diode lasers and diode pumped solid state lasers may have a life expentancy of only a few thousand hours to begin with and the one being offered may be near the end of useful life. And, if abused at any time, all bets are off and it may not even make a good boat anchor!\n\nFinally, here are some other common statements paraphrased from various actual eBay offerings:\n\nDescription: Laser tube ionizes but I don't know if it lases.\n\nTranslation: There is no beam when driven with my power supply.\n\nDescription: Power supply arcs trying to start tube. It needs minor repair.\n\nTranslation: Laser probably needs new tube.\n\nDescription: These argon ion laser tubes are nearly new and ready to use.\n\nTranslation: They are not split in half but their condition is otherwise unknown.\n\nDescription: I bypassed the switch and it powered right up.\n\nTranslation: The Power light came on.\n\nDescription: This auction is for three unused lasers.\n\nTranslation: I haven't attempted to power these pieces of junk since pulling them from the dumpster.\n\nDescription: This laser has very low hours.\n\nTranslation: I haven't used it much since pulling it from the same dumpster.\n\nDescription: This HeNe laser power supply is rated 5 mA at 1.5 kV but will run four foot long tubes if the input voltage is tripled.\n\nTranslation: The long tubes might flash just before the smoke comes out of the power supply.\n\nDescription: Untested.\n\nTranslation: It looks like a laser or, I had Joe plut it in and it behaved like a brick but I did not test it. :)\n\nDescription: Laser is marked 15.3 mW and came from working equipment.\n\nTranslation: Original power output was 15.3 mW but now may be much lower.\n\nDescription: Laser has power output of 8.5 mW but I am unable to test it.\n\nTranslation: Original power output was 8.5 mW but it may be dead now.\n\nDescription: Laser is in original factory crate.\n\nTranslation: Broken laser was removed from service and put into the crate in which the replacement was shipped.\n\nDescription: The resale value is over $1,000.\n\nTranslation: The original highly marked up price for a replacement in one particular piece of equipment was over $1,000.\n\nDescription: This laser is used, working condition is unknown. Tube is cracked and broken.\n\nTranslation: The remains of this laser may be useful as a doorstop.\n\nDescription: Laser system is complete, just plug it in. Untested but in excellent cosmetic condition.\n\nTranslation: I plugged it in and nothing happened but it looks nice.\n\nDescription: The capillary on this green HeNe laser tube is broken off inside the cathode, but this won't affect operation as it doesn't block the beam.\n\nTranslation: The already very marginal gain for the green wavelength is now much lower. The tube is now only useful to salvage the mirrors.\n\nDescription: This laser is a little scratched up on the outside but looks great inside.\n\nTranslation: I plugged it in, turned it on, and nothing happened.\n\nDescription: These lasers haven't been tested in over a year and are sold as-is.\n\nTranslation: Over a year ago they didn't work.\n\nDescription: Powers up and appears to be in good working condition accept for a broken bulb in the laser. Guaranteed not to be dead on arrival.\n\nTranslation: The laser tube is smashed but the power supply lights come on. It might make a decent door stop.\n\nDescription: These HeNe laser mirrors are new in bag.\n\nTranslation: The mirrors were ripped from dead HeNe laser tubes but are now in a new plastic bag.\n\nDescription: We have tested this unit for power, and it does power up.

Functionality beyond that is unknown, so it will be offered as-is.\n\nTranslation: The tube is dead and it's just blue bore light but it looks nice.\n\nDescription: In good physical condition from deactivated inventory.\n\nTranslation: They kept the dead junk on the books to boost the value of the company to investors.\n\nDescription: This laser has been tested. (No further comments.)\n\nTranslation: This laser had been tested and is dead.\n\nDescription: Don't know much about this setup, but the control box powers up fine.\n\nTranslation: The power light comes on but the HeNe laser power supply brick or HeNe laser head is totally dead.\n\nDescription: This power supply will run HeNe lasers up to 5 mW.\n\nTranslation: This power supply will run HeNe lasers with safety sticker ratings up to 5 mW, actual rated power of 1 or 2 mW.\n\nDescription: This laser came from a working environment.\n\nTranslation: This laser was found stuffed in a cabinet outside the clean room.\n\nWhether buying from a surplus outfit or a private individual, don't expect to get a new laser for bargain basement prices. The well known laser surplus places may buy up reject inventory from major laser companies like Melles Griot - laser heads and tubes that didn't meet spec even when new. Unless the item is clearly stated to be new and meets new specs, this can probably be assumed. If the model number is given, sometimes it's possible to tell a reject. For example, with Melles Griot lasers, a '-Q' suffix (e.g., 05-LYR-171-Q) means that the yellow HeNe laser head (in this case) didn't meet specs but still lases somewhat - its performance wasn't so terrible that it went to the crusher. (I have one that varies between 1.5 and 2.5 mW of yellow on a several minute cycle due to 3.391 um IR mode competition. It's still a very nice laser but not useful for many applications.) However, even if you know what to look for, the Q designation may not make it to sticker attached to the laser. With private sales there are several more levels of unknowns unless the laser was purchased new (unlikely!), the seller worked for a company that purchased it new before the project was cancelled, or the pedigree is completely known. :)\n\nAnd the most amusing listings I've seen on eBay lately go something like: \"Argon-Ion Laser Tube Air-Cooled Add Gas and Go\". Right, like all that is needed is a bottle of argon gas from your friendly welding supplier. Not! Even if these are usable at all (they could very well be rejects), just a bit more is needed. See the chapters on argon/krypton ion lasers before you end up with an expensive paperweight.\n\nThe only real way to protect yourself from deceptive or exaggerated advertising claims is a combination of getting the detailed specifications, buying from a reputable supplier, and obtaining a purchase arrangement that includes a binding money back guarantee in writing or some other way of cancelling a deal for merchandise that turns out not to be or do what was claimed!\n\nOf course, once you receive your laser, the only way to be truly sure of the output power is with a laser power meter or by comparison with another laser of known performance.\n\nRemember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. You aren't likely to be the only one to have 'discovered' a bargain - if no one else has bid it up at eBay there is probably a very good reason!\n\nAlso see the section: Equivalent Brightness Ratings and Laser Pointer Visibility since this is another area where the real and the imaginary are often jumbled together!\n\nSome Tips for Sellers\n\nHere are some assorted suggestions to optimize the buying experience and get the highest prices for your laser and high tech junk, err, merchandise. These are written with an auction in mind but most apply to classified ads and newsgroup postings (where permitted):\n\nBe truthful and complete in your description. For lasers, include the actual output power if relevant, not just the safety information. If the item has known defects which affect functionality, list them. You might get away with stretching the truth a few times but eventually, your reputation will suffer.\n\nInclude a few selected small photos of the equipment, inside and out. Use thumbnail links to high resolution photos but don't force them to be loaded unless requested. Not everyone has a cable modem, DSL, or a T3 line!\n\nMake some effort to compose the photos so they show your item(s) in the best light and with decent clarity to show knob and meter scales, labels, etc.\n\nTake a minute to do some basic dusting and cleaning. If the item looks like it has been at the bottom of a sewer, you won't get the best price!\n\nIf you can't take photos of the actual equipment and want to use some stock photos from a manufacturer's Web site or brochure, state clearly the origin of the photos and that they are \"typical\" and not of the exact items that are being offered. Above all, don't just grab something off the Web without permission! That's a copyright violation. If you can't or don't want to get permission, use a link to their Web site instead. The laser community is small enough that it's usually obvious when there is plagerism.\n\nInclude all label information in the text description even if it doesn't make sense to you.\n\nKeep the listing simple. My advice is to NOT use Java or Javascript since it doesn't add anything. Flashing and gyrating animations take longer to load and may annoy viewers of your auctions. Also, keep the Web HTML to the basics as well - various browser versions may choke on fancy tables and other more involved HTML. Avoid pop-ups like the plague. :) And, view your listing once its uploaded and \"live\", make sure everything is there and the photos show up! Then you can easily fix it before there are any bids.\n\nAs with photos, don't drop someone else's description into your listing without permission. Use a link to their Web site instead.\n\nBe clear about the shipping and any other costs above the asking or bid price. Include the approximate shipping weight and your ZIP code so buyers can estimate shipping costs if you don't have them listed. Don't short change yourself by omitting the cost and weight of essential packaging materials. Just don't be greedy and attempt to boost your income with clearly inflated S&H. People don't like to be hit with IPM (Increased Profit Margin)!\n\nMake an attempt to test items if at all possible. The bid price is likely to be many times higher for a \"tested and guaranteed not DOA\" item than for the identical item \"untested, sold as-is\". For a single one of a kind HeNe laser power supply, this may not be worth it. But if you will be selling a couple dozen, the cost of a laser head for testing will easily be made up on the first or second sale and the laser head can always be sold afterwards.\n\nFor \"reserve auctions\", my recommendation is that the reserve price be included in the description but that's your preference. I get annoyed bidding on something to only find out there was a ridiculously high reserve on it. Better yet is to simply start the bidding at what you consider the minimum acceptable price for the item.\n\nList the forms of payment accepted and any additional charges for the use of money transfer services like PayPal.\n\nInclude a brief summary of the conditions of sale including whether there is any sort of guarantee. This can be a link if desired.\n\nWith respect to returns, my recommendation is that items should be returnable in undamaged condition within say, 10 days, minus shipping charges if they were correctly represented. If misrepresented, then the seller should pay shipping both ways as well as any buyer costs (e.g., money transfer service fees) associated with the transaction.\n\nRespond to email promptly, be courteous, and answer in complete properly punctuated sentences. This will give the potential buyer the feeling you care about them.\n\nAfter the sale, make an effort to pack the item properly with enough cushioning so the gorillas at the shipping company can't break it even if they try really hard. :) For a small laser tube, this means 3 or 4 inches of styrofoam peanuts and/or small-bubble bubble wrap on all sides; for large lasers, this plus a box within a box or crate approach with appropriate damage insurance and documentation to show original condition and fair market value. See the other sections on shipping in this chapter.\n\nUse either a shipping company that has tracking (UPS, FedEx, etc.) or the USPS with \"Delivery Confirmation\" so you know the package at least got to its destination and the buyer can't claim non-delivery.\n\nAn automated \"checkout\" procedure is most convenient for buyers but only if it works smoothly and it's clear how and when to use it!\n\nPacking Laser Equipment to Withstand Drunk 900 Pound Gorillas During Shipping\n\nThe following applies to both the buyer and seller: Always assume that your package is likely to be tossed around like a bail of hay and that 'Fragile' stickers (or those silly icon that no one understands) just make good targets for drop-kick practice! If you are shipping the laser, make sure it is packed to withstand a nuclear bomb; if you are the buyer insist that the seller pack it to withstand a nuclear bomb - and offer to pay extra for shipping and packing material if necessary!\n\nHaving said all that, I did a very scientific test with one of my dead Spectra-Physics 084-1 barcode scanner HeNe laser tubes from which I had already cannibalized the mirrors. This is about 10 inches long with a spider supporting the bore (the most fragile part in an HeNe tube subjected to mechanical shock) at about the halfway point. I used about 2 to 3 inches of bubble wrap all around and stuffed it into a worn cardboard box about 5\" x 6\" x 13\" 'sealed' with an elastic band. I then abused this package to every way possible short of using a nuclear bomb (which were temporarily out of stock): Tossing it across the room, dropping on various sides and corners with and without spin from 7 feet onto a concrete floor, kicking it through the uprights, sitting on it, etc. The mirrorless tube survived just fine - the bore was well supported. What does this mean? Probably not much except for this particular model HeNe tube and it is still possible that the bore shifted slightly within the spider. There is no way to know that for sure without testing on a live tube (but it can also generally be corrected). However, in all likelihood, the typical HeNe tube would work just fine if packed in this manner (or better) even after all the abuse OOPS could dish out. :) Of course, an entire external mirror laser would likely be a much different story, especially one with a long plasma tube. And even if the glass parts survive, circuit boards and structural components can fracture from relatively low G forces if not well supported (due to poor design).\n\nOf course, the general rule is: If you ship a dead laser wrapped only in a single layer of brown paper, it will arrive in perfect condition. But, if you ship a functional laser in 6 inches of foam inside a box inside 12 inches of bubble wrap inside another box inside a crate, it will arrive in a thousand pieces. :) And if you then try to file a claim, it is possible for the carrier to insist that no amount of packing material is adequate.\n\nAnd as far as plastering the package with \"Fragile\" and \"Handle with Care\" stickers, I'm not convinced that there is any correlation between the number, size, and color of the stickers and survival rate. There may even be a negative correlation - such markings simply make your package a more inviting target. Even putting a high value on a package - not to be able to claim it if there is damage but simply to make the shipper take more care in handling - may not work. So, as noted above, the only way to have reasonable assurance of a laser or any delicate or fragile equipment arriving intact is to pack so that it can be dropped from a 747 at cruising altitude without a parachute and not be damaged.\n\nThe only relatively common similar item I know of that is more fragile than a laser tube is a rotating anode X-ray tube. (This is what X-ray types call the \"insert\", not the entire X-ray head.) With these, the heavy anode/motor assembly - which may weigh several pounds - is attached to the glass envelope only at one end with most of the mass at the unsupported end. So, even though the glass is rather thick and would normally survive some trauma, a relatively modest physical shock will cause the tube to fracture. To have any chance of survival during shipping, the anode/motor assembly must either be secured to a rigid structure as it is when mounted in the X-ray head assembly so that it can't flex with respect to the glass envelope, or the entire glass tube must be packed with something like 12 inches of soft foam rubber all around to minimize the g-forces when the box drops onto the sorting conveyer from 10 feet up. And even this is no guarantee.\n\nNote that no matter how well packed a laser is, shipping companies may give you a hard time about insurance claims and point to some disclaimer in their contract printed in 2 point type that disallows any coverage for lasers and other scientific apparatus. Some don't even consider the manufacturer's original packaging to be adequate even for computer monitors, let alone lasers. Of course, the seller may have simply sent you a broken laser. :(\n\nHere are some somewhat humorous but all too true guidelines. This was originally posted to the USENET newsgroup alt.lasers for a specific shipping company, whose name I have deleted.\n\n(Based on a posting from: NiteliteProducts.com (dglassburn@mindspring.com).)\n\nMany years of experience has shown that insurance claims through shipping companies are next to impossible to recover. Their reasons are as follows and they will deny claims in the following order:\n\nYou did not insure the item. If you did go to Step 2.\n\nItem was incorrectly packed. They will stall about 1 to 2 months to have someone inspect the package. If packed well go to Step 3.\n\nRead the print in the shipping booklet. Glass and ceramic items are probably not covered. Go to Step 4.\n\nTake them to court. Unless you feel like supporting the legal profession, you won't win anyway. give it up. Go to Step 5.\n\nIf the item was insured and clearly damaged in transit (like a forklift went through it or a truck rolled over it), they won't pay.\n\nMajor companies that ship all the time provide their own extra insurance coverage for this problem.\n\nBest bet is to ship with properly packed and supported parts so that anything short of (and possibly including) a nuclear bomb won't damage the laser.\n\nIn fact, I deal with a company that ships metrology lasers all over the World and they never insure with the shipping company for more than the minimum. I do not believe they even self insure. But, everything is very well packed and no credible amount of abuse is likely to cause damage. These are small lasers so it's not that difficult.\n\n(From: Steve Roberts.)\n\nI carefully build crates around my lasers, and insulate the lasers from shock with spray in foam that self hardens. Its a wonder how two of my crates have been reduced to kindling lately. One arrived sans crate! A third CO2 tube marked for special fragile handling by UPS (often pronounced OOOPS) didn't make it, it's been reduced to scrap glass. Same for an incredibly well packed 50 mW HeNe laser last year. I specified and paid for FedEx, but the seller used OOOOPPS to pocket the difference and ended up paying for my dead laser as a reward.\n\nAs for the broken CO2 tube, I'm driving 250 miles each way to replace it for the customer to keep my sanity, and my truck has a good suspension. According to a local driver, all OOOOOPPPSS packages drop 6 feet into a rotary sorting bin. I've had a few customers spec OOOOOPPPPSSS lately because FedEx was too expensive. Never again!\n\nI've had good luck with FedEx, only one package ever got smashed. Delta Air Freight also has done a decent job for me.\n\nFor small air-cooled lasers I've used the U.S. Postal Service, sent 'registered', so it's hand carried and locked up each night in a safe. I Had remarkably good results with the snail mail folks - slow, but it gets there in one piece. A little pricey, but competitive.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\nPack the laser in several layers of bubble wrap, tightly taped round the unit.\n\nThis then goes in a cardboard box, with several INCHES of foam pellets around it.\n\nThis then goes into a crate with 3 to 4 inches of spacing between it and the cardboard box, either filled with solid foam or sprayed in foam. Expect the crate to disappear by the time the unit arrives at its destination (if it ever does).\n\nIf it's a Spectra-Physics or similar glass tube, pull off the Brewster stem covers so they don't break the long glass stems by inertia or vibration.\n\nPut a block of soft foam under the tube at the brewsters and under any long runs of unsupported glass.\n\nGently tape or somehow hold down (RTV or Liquid Rubber?) long glass return paths on lasers that have them.\n\nGlass does flex a little and will break, so any appendages on the tube like gauges, fill stems, and gas reservoirs, must be anchored down in such a way they can flex to survive vibration but not snap off.\n\nSometimes it's best to remove the plasma tube and anchor it to a carefully designed board shipped in a different box insured as a plasma tube so they can't wiggle out of an insurance claim if it arrives in pieces. Joe Sixpack at OOOOOOOOOPPPPPPSSSSS figures his 4,000 pound car isn't fragile, so your 600 pound laser must not be either.\n\nIf it's a big heavy laser system, put it on a proper skid, so they don't jury rig it onto a forklift.\n\nFinally, clearly mark it as a HEAVY IRON ANVIL, SO THEY WILL HANDLE IT LIKE IT'S MADE FROM BIRDS EGGS. ;-0\n\n(From: Bob.)\n\nI recently had a problem with UPS breaking something on me, and although they paid the insurance claim, I looked to ways to better package fragile items. I have come up with the following: Wrap the breakable in a few layers of small bubble bubble wrap. This provides a layer of cushioning for the object. Then use self expanding polyurathane foam just like the stuff used in foam-in-place machines, but this stuff is the 2 pounds/cubic foot foam used in building boats. Two gallons of the stuff runs about $40 and is enough to fill a 55 gallon drum about 2/3rds full. The cool thing about this stuff is that if you use it to ship your items, they truly become indestructable. Use cheap industrial type trash bags to keep the foam from getting on the cardboard box and what you are shipping. Make a 'seat' of foam to lay the breakable in, then fill in the box with another trash bag and then foam fill, so that the box is totally full of foam. Make sure you use at least 4 to 6 inches of foam on all sides. So long as you start out with a cardboard box of decent integrity, you now have an in-destructable shipping box. I recently shipped a large X-ray tube in a double corrugated cardboard box that was 18 x 18 x 18 inches. At first the UPS manager didn't want to accept the shipment saying it wasn't properly packed for a fragile item. I then knocked the box off of the counter it sat on, stood on it, and hopped up and down a few times. Needless to say a proper application of marine foam is super strong!!! It still has some give to it, so if a box was dropped on a corner it would dent a small bit (you want some degree of deformation, otherwise you don't have any shock absorption effect going on!), but it makes your box virtually drop and or crush proof. I use the stuff to ship ANYTHING thats fragile now.\n\n(From: Laserlover (rpoulin@rohcg.on.ca).)\n\nI use MSAS Cargo International and add \"All Perils\" Insurance coverage to cover my butt and packing has to be up to their standards. All the other carriers like Fed-Ex, DHL, Purolator and the infamous UPS (OOOPSsss) will only pay for loss (mechanical damage) - and forget about anything made of glass or ceramic. MSAS Cargo International won't try to screw you as long as you can prove value of goods with quote from the original company or second source in the industry. Also take pictures before and after packing to prove integrity of goods being shipped.\n\nThe following definitely belongs in the humor department though it would be effective.\n\n(From: Rob (rob@lasers.org).)\n\nShip all lasers in coffins or caskets!\n\nMost shipping people honor the dead as they can relate to dead relatives.\n\nNo fork lift driver is going to stab a casket, Think of what smell or guts might come out the hole.\n\nThey are usually rounded on top, and the sides are not flat (delicate handles) so no stacking.\n\nThey aren't going to stand it on end, just in case a body falls out, they don't want any part of touching a dead person.\n\nThey will be eager to get your package there on time. They don't want that thing sitting in a corner, or in their warehouse.\n\nIf they lose it, the may fear criminal prosecution, or surely a investigation.\n\nI can see it now. When picking up the package from the airport, opening it up for inspection just to see the looks in their face as you open it on their dock. Shippers may feel sorry for you, and airlines may give you a free ticket to fly along with it, or at least priority seating.\n\nDidn't they do this during Prohibition? Well, at least in the Jack Lemon movie \"Some Like It Hot\". :) --- Sam.\n\nPacking a Spectra-Physics Model 127 Laser\n\nThe SP-127 is a large-frame HeNe laser, roughly 42 inches in length and 22 pounds. Since it's got a large glass tube inside, packing to minimize physical shock is essential.\n\n(The following approach was inspired by a laser packed and shipped to me by George Sohnle. I have added to it slightly.)\n\nUse a heavy cardboard shipping box with minimum dimensions of 14x15x50 inches. This is still within the maximum dimensions (girth plus length, or 108 inches in this case) of most carriers, for Ground shipping at least.\n\nCheck that the 4 screws (on the bottom of the laser) holding the SP-127 tube/resonator assembly in place are tight. It would be a real bummer to find out that while the packing did its job, the guts came loose and were happily bouncing themselves to death inside.\n\nRemove the key(s) and line cord. Wrap the laser in a large plastic bag to keep packing debris out.\n\nWrap this in 3 or 4 layers of small bubble bubble-wrap all around and at both ends.\n\nConstruct an inner \"box\" from polyurethane or styrofoam 1\" thick building insulation that snugly encloses the wrapped laser. Use packing tape to secure it all around and at the ends. This material is available at any building supply store or home center and can be cut with a knife.\n\nLine the shipping box on all six sides with a layer of similar 1\" thick building insulation.\n\nWrap the inner box with enough layers of bubble wrap so that it is a snug fit in the lined shipping box. An alternative is to use packing peanuts but there should then be some type of resilient spacers to assure that the inner box remains centered within the shipping box and can't settle during shipping.\n\nAdd several inches of medium density plastic foam at each end. (What I mean here is something stiffer than foam rubber but more resilient than the building insulation foam.)\n\nPut the key(s) and line cord in a plastic bag and tape in an obvious place so they won't be lost if the box gets torn.\n\nSecure the box with multiple layers of strong packing tape.\n\nLabel it Fragile, Do Not Drop, Delicate Glass Crystal, Do Not Stand on End, and Slimy Biological Specimens May Leak and Stink if Damaged. Only the last one is likely to have any effect on how it is handled by the shipping company, but the others may help if an insurance claim needs to be filed. It probably shouldn't be labeled \"laser\". :)\n\nFor the laser I received, the box and most of the packing is in a condition that can be reused. So, if and when I ship this laser, I'll probably factor a deposit (like $50) into the shipping cost, so the buyer can send it back to me.\n\nWhy Even the Best Packing May Not Be Sufficient\n\nThe following also was what used to be an SP-127 laser but arrived with a broken tube, though I am a bit skeptical. The name of the shipping company has been suppressed.\n\n(From: Someone who has had bad luck with laser shipping.)\n\nThe box was at least 6\" larger or more on each side of the laser head. I still have the box. The box is perfect and still is.\n\nI can only figure it took a nasty drop by the shipping company. I was at my local hub and I got to witness something that made me about pass out.\n\nI saw 3 huge boxes come out of the truck and go onto a roll table. Then came a little box. Then about 2 minutes later, 4 large boxes. When the 4 large boxes pushed the little one into the 3 large boxes and stop, the little box in the middle just made a sound like a glass bottle got crushed.\n\nYou could see that it was crushed to 1/3rd its size. I'm like that's gone. They still put it in the truck to get shipped out.\n\nSo after seeing that I can only imagine what my poor laser went though.\n\nThat's why I phone to pick items up. As I told you I know our local hub manager and when I know a package is coming in. I phone him, he will set it aside so I can pick it up. Only if I am unable to pick it up will I allow it to be delivered. Then it bounces on the truck until 4 to 4:30 PM when they are in my area.\n\n(From: Sam.)\n\nI wonder about that. The SP-127 box wasn't damaged at all? The tube is rather well mounted assuming it's original SP construction with all screws installed and tightened. It should be fastened at both ends, two straps for the large cathode bulb, and the two bore straightening assemblies. So, if the box is filled with packing peanuts or foam and the laws of physics still apply inside the box, it would take a really phenomenal shock to break the tube.\n\nComments on Shipping/Export of Small Lasers\n\nShipping lasers within the USA is usually no problem - except getting them to their destination in one piece. However, sending laser equipment overseas can be a hassle, especially for higher power lasers or those that were part of weapons systems like the M60 or Chieftain tank rangefinders that are currently quite popular on the surplus market. I don't know that there actually would be a problem with these specific devices but also wouldn't want to find out the hard way, with a knock on the door by someone from one of those three letter Government agencies! If you're thinking of selling these or other such lasers on eBay or elsewhere, I would probably recommend against agreeing to ship internationally. There are plenty of buyers in the USA for your junk, oops, high quality lasers. :)\n\nAt the very least, you will need to provide an invoice to the shipper (e.g., USPS, UPS) listing the item(s) to be shipped and the declared value. I do avoid using the word \"laser\" so as not to risk an overzealous or just greedy inspector from attempting to dig out an overdriven laser pointer. So far, I've shipped a variety of (non-weapon) lasers overseas without incident. For small HeNe lasers, I just put \"barcode scanner tube\" (for the SP-084) and \"particle scanner tube\" (for the one-Brewster Climet 9048) with a declared value of $0.00 on the invoice and on the Postal form (for total weight under 4 pounds), marked them as a \"gift\". These weigh next to nothing so they don't attract the attention of overworked customs inspectors and there's nothing illegal about shipping these lasers to most foreign countries anyhow. Putting some small value other than $0 may attract even less attention though.\n\nFor larger HeNe lasers or DPSS lasers where insurance is desired, the value for Customs can't be less than the insured value. So the buyer may need to pay duty or VAT or whatever, but that's still worthwhile given the overall discount compared to new! However, as noted elsewhere, getting major insurance claims honored for damage may be impossible, so packing must be even better for international shipments. And should the package be lost, you'll need proof of value to have any chance of getting it paid. I've yet to have anything actually lost, though USPS did \"misplace\" a large HeNe laser for a month or two. It somehow ended up in U.S. Customs, when it should have been going out of the USA. Then, just as I was about to file a claim, it mysteriously got moving in the proper direction!\n\nSome additional comments follow.\n\n(From: Mike Harrison (mike@whitewing.co.uk).)\n\nFor the UK in particular, anything which has a declared value below UKP18 (about US$25) as merchandise, or UKP36 ($50) as a gift will not be charged import duty, so putting these values will not cause a problem, and might look more credible. Above this there is duty (typically 17.5% VAT) on the goods value PLUS the postage charge, then another UKP3.75 'handling charge', and the package can be delayed by 1 to 2 weeks.\"\n\n(Portions from Steve Roberts.)\n\nOn a simple unstabilized cheap HeNe laser there are no export controls as far as I know. I have never heard of any regulations on anything that did not have strategic importance, especially if you're only shipping one. Were it a dozen then I would be concerned. Several U.S. HeNe laser manufacturers have sold entire state of the art HeNe production lines to China. Don't loose any sleep over it.\n\nBesides, it's importing things where customs is concerned with lasers. And unless it deals with drugs, murder, or white collar crime, the U.S. is never going to extradite you. :-)\n\nHowever, for high power diodes lasers or parts of lasers, green YAGs, lasers over a few watts, lasers that can be used as weapons, lasers that stabilize themselves, lasers that can blind pilots, LIDAR, something like research picosecond or Terawatt lasers, and lasers that can be used for semiconductor or uranium processing, one has to be careful. These need approval from the State Department. In addition, shipping to laser or other high tech equipment or parts to certain specific countries will raise red flags with the Government so you will have to do your homework to avoid a serious hassle or worse.\n\n(From: John_LeB (jleb_888@hotmail.com).)\n\nAll proscribed technology is covered under the Bureau of Export Administration. The Export Administration Database provides links to the files listing various technologies.\n\nThere is a PDF file which you can find that will list proscribed technology. There are links on the web site to regional and national phone numbers where reps will talk with you. You want category 6 - Sensors and Lasers.\n\nI went through all of this to get my crypto software licensed for export and got an exemption on it. So it is relatively easy to navigate once you get to the page and find the PDF files with the info.\n\nTo export out of the USA, you would just need either an export license or an exemption. Then in the packaging you would need to put the export license number on the packing list, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nBack to Laser and Parts Sources Sub-Table of Contents.\n\nNew, Surplus, Walk-In, Mail Order/Web, Kits/Plans (Commercial)\n\nThe following sections provide links and/or contact info for many companies offering lasers, optics, and laser related equipment and parts as well as some general electronics distributors and surplus outfits, scrap and salvage places, and tips on where to pick up big lasers cheap.\n\nThe listings below are mostly in alphabetical order, domestic (US) followed by foreign.

On-line catalog with prices includes a Manufacturer Overrun page with (currently - Winter 1999) some really good prices on a visible laser diode (660 nm, 5 mW, $2.50) and driver ($3.00) - both quantity 1,000 unfortunately. :( See the section: Comments on Some Commercial Drivers and Detectors for information on modulating these modules. NVG products are now distributed by DigiKey.\n\nResources Un-Ltd., 1-603-668-2499, http://www.resunltd4u.com/. Their Web site lists specials, optics, components, test equipment, batteries, etc. Some lasers including diode laser modules and other laser related equipment including argon ion and CO2 lasers or laser heads and power supplies. (They are also supposed to have a full page ad in Nuts and Volts magazine every month.)\n\nSurplus Shed, 1-877-7SURPLUS, http://www.surplusshed.com/. (Formerly, Surplus Shack.) Surplus lenses, prisms, mirrors, instruments, cameras, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, filters, antique optical equipment, radio and electronics, etc. (but apparently no lasers). They currently also carry the CDROM with the complete collection of Amateur Scientist articles from Scientific American (which includes, of course, all those dealing with lasers and optics in \"Light and its Uses\"). Their price is $79.00 compared to the list price of $89.95.\n\nBull Electrical (UK), Phone: 44 (0)1273 203500, http://www.bullnet.co.uk/. This is an interesting site, though their Web site seems to be a bit screwed up. They used to list HeNe lasers up to 30 mW including a 3 mW yellow one; Chieftain Tank pulsed diode lasers for your next wargame simulation; plans for CO2 and CuCl lasers, a laser light show, laser bounce listener; and other laser related items. There was much more interesting and strange stuff at this site. However, at the present time, some of it is inaccessible.\n\nOne person who bought a red laser rated at 5 mW said that what they received was an apparently new in box, bare HeNe laser tube made by \"The Shanghai Institute of Laser Technology\" (S.I.L), whoever they are. Though marked 8.5 mW, it probably didn't output more than 5 mW. He recommends against buying Bull's supposedly compatible power supply as it may fry if used with tubes larger than about 2 mW (as he found out after 10 minutes). (However, I didn't see any HeNe laser power supplies on their lasers page.)\n\nHB-Laserkomponenten GmbH, http://www.hb-laser.com/. This German company appears to have some really good prices on second-hand lasers and laser components (in addition to new equipment). I don't know how this all works out once shipping and taxes are included but it is worth checking out their on-line catalog. Note that since most of this laser equipment originated in the US, there may not be any import duties for shipments back here. Items include helium-neon, argon and krypton ion, and CO2 laser tubes, heads, power supplies, and accessories. Also some Nd:YAQ and other solid state lasers; laser show, welding, and medical laser systems; optics, scanners, and more. Get your ion laser tubes refilled as well! For used/surplus equipment, go direct to: Second Hand Laser.\n\nMail Order - Electronics Surplus, Some Lasers - Varies from Month to Month\n\nThese companies offer a wide and constantly changing variety of new and surplus electronic components, modules, subassemblies, and other weird, interesting, and sometimes useful stuff generally including some lasers, laser parts, kits, and other laser related items:\n\nAll Electronics, 1-800-826-5432, http://www.allelectronics.com/. Mostly electronics surplus with occasional lasers and laser related items.\n\nAlltronics, 1-408-778-3868. Mainly electronics but includes a an assortment of laser diodes and diode laser modules and some optics/telecom items.\n\nAmerican Science and Surplus, 1-847-982-0870, http://www.sciplus.com/. Their catalog (which is on-line) is a must-see for the humor alone but the print version (which is free and they will mail to you) is much more convenient for bedtime reading! Their Web site currently (Summer 2004) lists a nice polarized 5 mW (actual output power) HeNe laser head for under $25. Someone who bought one says it's a Melles Griot 05-LHP-153.\n\nThey also have a separate optics catalog (Stock number 24799) which you can also request via email (but they may want to charge you a whole $1 for it if you don't order something at the same time. Hint: Commenting that \"Sean is a cool guy\" will almost assure a free catalog!). This looks like a very nice source listing hundreds of inexpensive (mostly glass) lenses, mirrors, and other optical items.\n\nCTR Surplus, 1-419-683-3535 (maybe, no longer seems to have their Web site. Everything on eBay under CTR-Surplus). All sorts of surplus equipment from computers to modular buildings/trailers. :) A bit of laser stuff from time-to-time.\n\nDIY Electronics (Hong Kong), http://www.kitsrus.com/. Over 140 electronics kits and several visible diode laser modules with built-in drivers and adjustable focus. On-line catalog, world-wide shipping, major credit cards accepted.\n\nElectronic Goldmine, http://www.goldmine-elec.com/, surplus parts, electronic kits, etc.\n\nHaltek Electronics, 1-415-969-0510.\n\nJameco, 1-800-831-4242, http://www.jameco.com/, electronic components and computer products. A recent catalog lists a (1, one, singular) 670 nm laser diode and low cost compact laser diode driver (don't know if it uses optical feedback or just a current regulator), as well as two diode laser modules, some optics, and of course, a whole bunch of laser pointers.\n\nMarlin P. Jones & Associates, Inc., 1-800-652-6733, http://www.mpja.com/. Surplus and new parts, electronic kits. The on-line catalog at their Web site currently (Spring, 2000) lists a HeNe laser power supply brick of unknown manufacturer (similar to the one from Herbach and Rademan described in the section: 1 mW HeNe Laser Powered by 12 VDC, 1 A Wall Adapter, a flyback based HV power supply kit suitable for small HeNe laser tubes, other power supplies, at least one laser pointer, and a mini 'laser show'. They used to have several types of HeNe laser tubes but these seem to have disappeared.\n\nParallax Technology, Inc. (actually a manufacturer and servicer of CO2 lasers) has a Surplus Vacuum and Electronic equipment for Sale page which has some items that may be of interest to the laser enthusiast even if you aren't in the market for a CO2 laser tube.\n\nOATLEY Electronics (Australia), http://www.oatleyelectronics.com/. In addition to general electronics parts and kits, their Laser Products include some HeNe lasers and power supplies, laser diodes and drivers, diode laser module kits, small light shows, etc.\n\nElectronic Surplus, Inc. has a laser category with a few HeNe and diode lasers.\n\nScience-Surplus.com, http://www.goldmine-elec.com/. A few items including a relatively inexpensive CCD spectrometer and some B&W Tek blue (473 nm) DPSS lasers in varying condition.\n\nCheck out the on-line links to Silicon Valley Surplus Sources as well.\n\nMail Order - Electronic Components\n\nFor general electronic components, the following will fill your needs (these are just a sampling). Some of these companies do list a few laser diodes and other opto-electronic components:\n\nAllied Electronics, Inc., 1-800-433-5700, http://www.alliedelec.com/.\n\nDigiKey, 1-800-DIGIKEY, http://www.digikey.com/. Digikey now has a fairly decent selection of visible laser diodes and diode laser modules including those from Coherent, Lumex, NVG, Panasonic, and others.\n\nHosfelt Electronics, 1-800-524-6464, http://www.hosfelt.com/en-us/toc.html.\n\nHV Component Associates, Inc. (now part of Dean Technology), 1-732-938-4499, http://www.hvca.com/.\n\nThis company is of the 'I thought I died and went to heaven' variety (whether you believe in that stuff or not) if you are need specialized high voltage rectifiers for your HeNe, CO2, or other laser or general high voltage power supply projects. They have an on-line catalog with complete specifications and offer to send a print catalog as well as free samples. I don't know to what extent this includes free samples to hobbyist types who may not be ordering $1,000,000 worth of merchandise. They say: \"qualified OEMs only\" which suggests not but it may still be worth a try if you only need a little diode or two, or will then need to buy 100 more. You can never tell when a company will consider the possibility of a referral or future loyal customer to be worth a modest initial investment! However, please don't abuse the privilege if they are accommodating.\n\nHV Stuff, http://www.hvstuff.com/.\n\nThis Web-only store appears to have the perfect selection of high voltage components for HeNe laser power supplies and other HV projects including capacitors, diodes, and even wire, and at very reasonable prices. I wish they had been around when I was building his sort high voltage electronics in the past and had to recycle parts from other equipment! :)\n\nMouser, 1-800-346-6873, http://www.mouser.com/.\n\nThe following companies carry a wide selection of semiconductors (including many Japanese types) and in addition have replacement parts for microwave ovens (and other consumer electronic equipment) which may be useful for some laser power supply designs:\n\nDalbani, 1-305-716-1016, http://www.dalbani.com/.\n\nMCM Electronics, 1-800-543-4330, http://www.mcmelectronics.com/.\n\nParts Express, 1-800-338-0531, http://www.parts-express.com/.\n\n(From: Kim Clay (bkc@maco.net).)\n\nI live in West Palm Beach, Florida & there aren't any surplus or discount electronics places close but I have found some nice sources on the web. Like\n\nDan's Small Parts, for 1N4007's and disk caps for HV ladders (just noticed he's got 1N4007's for 100/$1.00 now! Great for making custom high voltage rectifiers.),\n\nW. J. Ford Surplus, for inexpensive meters (found a matching set of Simpson meters - 5 kV 1 mA full scale meter and 5 kV 5M series dropping resistor along with a 10 mA meter).\n\nAngela Instruments, where I found a 1,300 VRMS \"Mystery Power Transformer\" for $10.00 - he sometimes has good deals on small Variacs also. The 1300v transformer is waiting on a couple of HV caps (microwave maybe?) when a good deal comes along. Currently (end 1998), they have a 2180 VRMS CT at 46 mA DC (whatever that means) transformer for $18. This would be suitable for a power supply to drive high power HeNe lasers (e.g., HeNe tubes of 25 to 35 mW or more).\n\nBG Micro, where I got my 556 chips. They also have some deals on Power FETS and lots of other stuff.\n\n(To get an idea of what Kim has been putting together, see the section: Kim's Mid-Size HeNe Laser Power Supply (KC-HL1). --- sam)\n\nElectronic, Optics, and Laser Project Plans, Kits, Parts, Specialized Components\n\nI have no direct experience with any of the vendors below, so I cannot really comment on either the quality of their customer service or on how their claims compare with reality! However, most of the really nutty places seem to be concentrated in this section! I have included general comments when available.\n\nArbor Scientific, Phone: 1-800-367-6695, http://www.arborsci.com/. Kits, demonstrations, parts, and equipment related to lasers, optics, holography, and other physical sciences. On-line catalog with prices.\n\nInformation Unlimited/Amazing Concepts, Phone: 1-603-673-4730, http://www.amazing1.com/.\n\nThis place is definitely worth an 'at least check out their Web site'. Much weird stuff including specialized parts (as well as plans and complete kits) needed for the laser and other projects in the two Iannini books [2] and [3] (though cheaper alternatives using readily available components may be available). Laser related products include HeNe, diode, and DPSS (green) lasers; laser pointers, mini-light shows, laser listeners and communicators; CO2 and YAG lasers; and some parts like power supplies, rods, and flashlamps. Many are available as plans, kits, or completely assembled and tested systems.\n\nMost of the products they offer in areas like lasers and high voltage seem reasonable (though claims may sometimes be shall we say, a bit optimistic), if you are interested in something in one of their more way-out departments like anti-gravity, realize that the laws of physics haven't been repealed on their site and you shouldn't be disappointed when the item that arrives isn't a fully operational \"Back to the Future\" hoverboard. :)\n\nCarl's Electronics, 1-978-422-5142, http://www.electronickits.com/. Electronics kits and plans. They have plans for a 40 W CO2 laser, ruby laser pistol, and diode laser pistol. I have no idea of the integrity of this outfit or the quality of what they offer. They kind of appear to be in the same league as Information Unlimited, above.\n\nElectronic Rainbow, Inc., 1-317-291-7262, http://www.rainbowkits.com/. Electronics, computer, phone, and other kits, and a few laser pointers.\n\nFuture Horizons, 1-906-249-5197, http://www.futurehorizons.net/. This is another place with lots of weird (and some technically impossible) stuff and I'd think several times before considering buying any of it. The tip-off should be the 900 phone number. Includes plans and assembled ruby laser pistol.\n\nImages SI, Inc., 1-718-698-8305, http://www.imagesco.com/. Parts and kits for many types of projects. Some holography and laser items. Includes on-line catalog with prices.\n\nLasPro (Germany), no phone number, http://www.laspro.de/. Parts for DPSSFD green lasers. They claim power outputs up to 200 mW CW or 350 mW Q-switched. I have no idea whether this is realistic.\n\nPlans and Kits Unlimited (PKU), no phone, http://www.plans-kits.com/. PKU also sells a variety of miscellaneous stuff via eBay as eBay ID: Ninteach.\n\nNote: Plans and Kits has gone through some twists and turns over the laser year or so including legal proceedings likely due to questionable dealings or something worse. I do not have any details. Much of what they sell is of limited value at best and should probably be avoided like a laser beam to the eye. This place has gotten multiple thumbs-down in its former life as Unlimited Underground Electronics (UUE) for exaggerated, way out, conflicting, unrealistic claims (I'm being generous), and shoddy merchandise - everything else is unknown. However, in all fairness, there have been satisfied and repeat customers as well, perhaps those who are knowledgeable about what they are buying and can inspect (and possibly select) the merchandise in person. This site is amusing to visit but anyone who knows more about technology than a ripe carrot will realize that much of the blurb on their site has to be bogus.\n\nThere is also a chatroom and bulletin board/discussion group on the site which might provide some additional amusement (for a few milliseconds, anyhow) especially as some technically knowledgeable people attempt to clarify, correct, or dispute some of the claims. If you think about buying anything from them, realize that what arrives may bear little resemblance in appearance, function, or performance to what is described on their Web site. Terms like \"Ready to go\" and \"Perfectly matched\" may have different meanings that what you might assume. :)\n\nPKU also offers a set of plans for using a HeNe laser tube to build a high power mercury vapor ion laser. I assume this is supposed to be similar to the one described in the chapter: Home-Built Helium-Mercury (HeHg) and Other He-Metal-Vapor Lasers and represents a tantalizing shortcut if it can be made to work. See the section: Using a HeNe Laser Tube in a Home-Built HeHg Laser? where I speculate on how such a conversion might be done.\n\nHigh Quality New and Surplus\n\n(Also see the section: Some Laser and Optics Manufacturers and Suppliers for well known names like Coherent/Ealing and Melles Griot. Those listed here are more oriented to retail sales.)\n\nThis may also mean high prices for many items (at least compared to what you might have expected) so you should be sitting down when you are browsing the catalogs or Web sites of these suppliers. However, there are exceptions.\n\nBid-Service LLC, 1-732-863-9500, http://www.bidservice.com. This place caters to the semiconductor processing industry but has listings for laser systems broken out separately. However, you won't find $10 HeNe tubes. :)\n\nBMI Surplus Equipment Brokers, 1-781-871-8868, http://www.bmius.com/. On-line catalog includes many complete lasers of all types - CO2, ion, YAG, excimer; optical equipment, and nearly everything else from air compressors to water chillers.\n\nDNA Equipment, 1-330-769-5444, http://www.dnaequipment.com/. Products include complete laser systems like Laserscopes, as well and optical and electronic test equipment and more. Not for 1 mW HeNe laser!\n\nEdmund Scientific, 101 East Gloucester Pike, Barrington, NJ 08007-1380, 1-609-573-6250, http://www.edsci.com/.\n\nLasers and optics as well as many bargain priced new and surplus scientific items. The new research quality items are expensive but there are many reasonably prices parts, kits, and just plain old fascinating stuff.\n\nTheir catalog is a must even if you never intend to purchase anything. I remember fascinating trips to their retail store stocked with bin-upon-bin of interesting and unusual (and sometimes unidentifiable!) optical and electronic items. I do not know what it is like these days.\n\nCascade Laser Corp., 1-503-554-1926, http://www.cascadelaser.com/. Precision engineered direct replacement parts and laser accessories. On-line catalog and ordering. Distributor for several laser companies. They also do power supply and RF driver repair, optical resurfacing, more.\n\nHolo-Spectra, Inc., 1-800-275-4880 or 1-818-994-9577, http://www.lasershs.com/. Lasers, optics, laser entertainment equipment and software, more. Also, ion laser and solid state laser repair and refurb, replacement parts, etc.\n\nKentek Corporation, 1-800-432-2323. Laser replacement parts (mostly for solid state lasers), accessories, supplies, books, educational materials, remanufactured lasers, etc.\n\nLMDC, 1-510-429-1060, http://www.lasermotion.com/. Lasers, motion control, and optics. The on-line catalog includes several HeNe, ion, CO2, dye, YAG, and other (mostly high quality) lasers, and many other interesting components and equipment including servo controlled linear and X-Y platforms and rotary stages, optical tables, microscopes, video and specialty cameras and lenses. They also provide integration and consulting services.\n\nMusser and Associates, 1-714-841-1002, http://opticaltables.com/. Used optical tables, breadboards, components including laser diode drivers and temperature controllers, more.\n\nOptoSigma, 1-714-851-5881, http://www.optosigma.com/. All kinds of optics. Includes complete on-line catalog for lenses, prisms, mirrors, optics mounts, filters, stages, and much more.\n\nProduction Engineering - Medical Equipment Division (PEMED) has all sorts of - you guessed it - surplus medical equipment. Do you need a slightly used heart-lung machine? :) Anyhow, they have a several CO2 and YAG laser systems for sale on their Surgical Lasers Page and some of the prices aren't too bad.\n\nSterling Resale Optics, no phone number, http://www.sro-optics.com/. New and used optics including lenses, mirrors, filters, windows, wedges, beamsplitters, a xenon flashlamp, and more. They also have KTP crystals for use in frequency doubling of DPSS lasers as well as Nd:YAG rods and more. On-line catalog with prices. Much of their inventory came from Lawrence Livermore National Labs so should be of very high quality.\n\nUsed Line, no phone number, http://used-line.com/. Over 10,000 advertisements for used scientific equipment including some laser and optics items. However, prices tend to be high or not listed so this probably isn't your first stop!\n\nScrap and Salvage\n\nYes, among other places, junk and salvage yards. Many types of equipment contain lasers and these eventually end up at these sorts of business on their way to the land-fill. Unfortunately, in many cases, the lasers will have been removed or rendered useless (translation: smashed) to satisfy various regulatory requirements but often high performance graphic arts equipment like, printers, scanners, duplicators, phototypsetters; fiber optic communications gear; and other high tech systems will contain HeNe, argon ion, or more recently, diode lasers. There will usually be some sort of laser safety sticker on the chassis. From its type and power level description, you can probably get an idea of what is inside. It's up to you to figure a way to haggle the price down on the laser portion of the junk without looking too interested. :) Don't forget that you want the power supplies and possibly the optics in addition to the laser itself.\n\nOther possibilities: Companies clearing their 'dead storage' or excess inventory, or going out of business, and auctions and liquidation sales.\n\nYou can often find small lasers and laser parts at high tech flea markets and hamfests. Sometimes intact research lasers will show up there but often they are so old that the tube is gassy and usless (unless you are into regassing).\n\nHow to Get a Laser Without Really Trying - Part 1\n\nIf you are have the guts and are willing to make some phone calls and don't mind being told \"no\" some portion of the time, consider the following:\n\nCAUTION: What you may end up with is/are one or more BIG lasers in unknown condition. These are extremely dangerous on all fronts - especially electrically and should they work, from the high power beam! You MUST do this in a responsible manner both for your own and others' safety as well as to not abuse the fabulous opportunity that a successful outcome can provide.\n\nOld lasers may be available from biomedical sources like hospitals and clinics. These places buy the latest, work them to death or until something better comes along, then puts them in storage and eventually sells or gives them away for scrap. If you do find an offer of one or more of these, you will need transportation (e.g., a truck or large minivan - they won't fit in the back of a Honda Civic!) and some buddies to do the heavy lifting.\n\nWARNING: Where the laser came from a hospital or clinic, you must assume that the business end at least (the articulated beam guide) has probably been in all sorts of places you wouldn't want to go and may have collected all sorts of stuff you wouldn't normally eat or use for bathing! Yes, they were supposed to have been sterilized but given that the laser may have been put into storage because it failed, such procedures may not have been performed. You MUST clean the entire thing except for the actual interior of the laser head with a strong disinfectant as noted below. (Perhaps you can pick up a couple gallons of hospital-grade disinfectant at the same time - one swipe of alcohol may not be enough!) Take care - there is going to be sharp sheet metal and other hazards - open wounds and biomedical waste are not a happy combination!\n\nThe most likely type of lasers available from biomedical sources will be old but could very likely be serviceable or repairable. Most common types are CO2, but you may end up with a high power YAG or Ar/Kr ion type. For the latter, it is quite likely you won't have the power feed required to use them without serious effort and expense as high current 230 VAC three-phase is often what is used. The 'smaller' CO2 units will run on standard 115 VAC, 15 or 20 A.\n\nThus, think several times before actually taking these recommendations seriously - you could end up with a major headache or a major bonanza depending on your negotiating skills, technological abilities, and LUCK!\n\nThe following approach has worked for me quite a few times. Mostly you get dead units but to quote Clara Peller: \"Partz is partz\".\n\nCall your local hospitals. Tell them you're looking for old lasers for parts and make sure they understand you're going to demedicalize them, Ask for Biomedical or Clinical Engineering - get past the secretary and and talk to a tech or engineer. Avoid talking to accounting or materials management if you can, they want money. Make sure you tell them your end use is a home made engraver. If they are reluctant to let you have it, offer to smash the delivery arm in front of them with a sledge. These people are used to getting such calls, mostly from companies that recycle medical gear.\n\nDon't be shocked if you hear: \"Be here in 15 minutes with a truck and some people to help you load it\". Ask for units by Coherent or Sharplan. You WILL need the pickup truck or a decent sized minivan. Take a complete set of allen wrenches including the larger sized ones and tools/socket set to partially dismantle it. Expect to be told the unit will be free or low cost - you're helping them dispose of a 200 to 500 pound monster. Use gloves when you take it apart as most CO2s are used for gynecology. When you get it home, scrub it down with alcohol except for the tube assembly. Take plastic sheets, tarps, rope and trash bags.\n\nIf they don't have one, still ask for their address to send them a letter or business card so they can reach you in the future. If they ask you to take a skid or two of other scrap do so. Also ask if they know of other biomed guys with units laying around.\n\n(From: Bob.)\n\nHospitals would be the first and best place to look. Although nice letters may be the formal polite way of locating equipment, all the people I know who have had any luck getting any lasers from any hospital did so by wearing out their telephone. It seems as though the fellow responsible for getting rid of the hospital's equipment is always a busy harried individual who is willing to let an average Joe get a laser because he offers to make it as painless for the hospital person as possible. In other words, he doesn't have to make any telephone calls, you just show up with a truck and the manpower to load something he considers garbage. Also keep in mind that you may talk to 10 people at the same institution before you actually talk to the fellow responsible for their surplus equipment. It's much easier to get passed down the chain if someone you call can simply tell you over the phone \"you need to talk to Harry at ext. 234\" than if you send a letter that places the responsibility onto someone else to actually see to it that your letter gets to the right hands, possibly several someone elses. Other sources of lasers might include local businesses (i.e., read the Sunday want-ads for advertisements of auctions, especially if you have any aerospace or other high tech industry in town. You may also want to try large print shops, occasionally universities will excess equipment, and naturally there is always the Net - eBay and other places are gold mines for used equipment but you need to spend the hours in front of the computer screen to find them and you better know the value of what you bid on so you don't get the short end of a bad deal.\n\n(From: Robin S. (lasernerd@hotmail.com).)\n\nI work in the machine shop at a cancer research hospital. There's a huge 4.5 W argon/2.5 W dye laser in the back they didn't even know WAS a laser. You may want to find the machine shop/work shop if you go hunting. Personally, I'd go in person. Some people may be inclined to help you, and some may be too lazy (the phone makes it very easy to be lazy). Be VERY nice, and food ALWAYS helps! Bring a 6 pack of doughnuts or something. You may not get anything, but they'll be willing to talk to you.\n\nHow to Get a Laser Without Really Trying - Part 2\n\nA variety of high speed graphics arts equipment (not your typical office copier or laser printer) include an argon ion laser. These consist of a laser head and power supply. While most of the time, the laser heads are refurbished when they no longer perform adequately, some may be available free of charge if you know where to ask.\n\nHowever, you will probably not get the power supply since the they are usually not replaced when the laser heads die. Therefore, before pursuing this, realize that a power supply will have to be bought ($300 to $1,000 or more) or built. The latter is a non-trivial undertaking. See the chapters starting with: Argon and Krypton Ion Lasers.\n\n(From: Flavio Spedalieri (fspedalieri@nightlase.com.au).)\n\nI have managed to get two air-cooled argon lasers free of charge. Argon laser are used in industrial high-speed printing machines. If you contact your local companies, you may get lucky.\n\nSome companies that deal with these types of printers are Xerox, Dainippon Screens, and Ricoh.\n\nMy lasers came from Dainippon Screens. The lasers worked well. One of the lasers is multi-lined. The company was throwing them out, but as I called in earlier, and left my name, they actually thought to call me back.\n\nIf you speak with the technical repairs department, and mention that you are requiring a laser to teach a bunch of students, then you could be lucky.\n\nPlease be aware that in these printers, the lasers are usually tuned to 488 nm (bright blue). Some laser heads may have a line tuning prism on the back and these are tunable to any of the 8 or so argon ion wavelengths.\n\nBack to Laser and Parts Sources Sub-Table of Contents.\n\nOn-Line Sources (Non-Commerical)\n\nYou Don't Have to Buy from Companies\n\nWhile the numerous commercial laser and parts suppliers listed in the sections starting with: New, Surplus, Walk-In, Mail Order, Kits/Plans (Commercial) can probably fulfill your needs, you may be in for a bit of sticker shock - even if you are only considering used or surplus!\n\nThe following alternatives are most often offers from private individuals (though not always - buyer beware) and are in addition to the zillions of companies that have Web sites. There are varying amounts of risk in not dealing with a well known reputable company. Prices can vary from dirt cheap to way out of line. So you MUST know the value of what is being offered. Unlike companies which compete with each other, some of these people may start with a very high price and hope there is a least one sucker out there!\n\nIn addition to honesty and ethics concerns, once you settle on a price, make sure the seller knows how to pack your (often fragile) equipment properly. It is amazing how much abuse can be inflicted by package shipping companies like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. If it costs you a couple of dollars extra for a larger box and more bubble wrap or styrofoam peanuts - and shipping insurance - it may be well worth it!\n\nNewsgroups and Similar Forums\n\nPosts offering laser diodes and drivers, helium-neon laser tubes, power supplies, and complete lasers, optical and mechanical parts, and other items that are useful to the laser enthusiast are quite common. Mostly, these are from private individuals but not always. These will most likely be found on the following newsgroups:\n\nalt.lasers (Primarily lasers)\n\nsci.optics (All types of optics)\n\nsci.electronics.components (Electronic components)\n\nsci.electronics.equipment (Electronic equipment)\n\nsci.electronics.misc (Miscellaneous electronics)\n\nsci.engr.lighting (Lighting technology)\n\nA search via Google Groups (formerly Deja.com/Dejanews) should turn up suitable recent postings.\n\nOffers of inexpensive lasers, laser components, and other related items may also appear from time-to-time on various other discussion groups. See the sections: Laser (Email) Listservers and Laser Discussion Groups and Technical Forums. One that sees a fair amount of this type of traffic is:\n\nLaserFX - Unclassified Ads\n\nIt allows both private and commercial postings for buy, sell, trade, wanted, employment opportunities, announcements, etc. This is where you might find your next BIG laser!\n\nInternet Classifieds\n\nThese are offers of laser equipment from people who have posted to alt.lasers or sci.optics or have a private Web site and have more than a few items to sell. I have put these in here as a service to the laser community - they are not paid ads. Unless otherwise noted, I cannot vouch for their quality or reliability. Some of the (as far as I know) current ones are listed below. These are in no particular order (perhaps just based on when I found them, sort of):\n\nSkywise's Items for Sale Page has some items from time to time. He also has Used and Surplus Links.\n\nEmission Technologies offers plans as well as kits with all the glass and metal parts; optics, gas, vacuum, and water tubing; and adhesives to construct 35 W and 60 W flowing gas CO2 laser, sealed CO2 laser tubes and switching power supplies, and even a kit for a complete X,Y CNC laser cutter which can be used for hobby or industry. The manual for at least the 35 W flowing gas laser is available (free) at this site has detailed instructions for assembly, alignment, and operation, as well as basic information on power supplies and vacuum/gas handling systems and is generally useful even if you aren't interested in his specific kits.\n\nSam's Stuff for Sale or Trade and Items Wanted\n\nI (Sam) have a variety of laser, optics, electronics, and other goodies for sale or trade. There are also some \"Wanted to Acquire\" items listed there. See Sam's Classified Page. Also see Please Don't Scrap Your Unwanted or Broken Lasers or Laser Related Equipment and Parts!, although at this point I'm being very selective.\n\nAuctions\n\nWhile eBay and other on-line auction sites are most likely to have offers of overpriced laser pointers, real lasers and laser related equipment do show up and can often be acquired at attractive prices. There is a continuous stream of helium-neon lasers, tubes, and power supplies; some argon ion, carbon dioxide, ruby, YAG, and occasional other types of lasers; and even a few really strange (and possibly valuable) lasers, laser components (e.g., HeNe tubes with Brewster windows, ruby or Nd:YAG rods, optics), and other laser related items, as well as all sorts of optical instruments. There are also gizmos containing lasers like the innards of laserdisc players and barcode scanners. For the home-built laser enthusiast, Variacs, vacuum pumps, and other support equipment of all types and sizes may be found as well. The eBay Smart Search Page can be used to hunt for all sorts of goodies.\n\nWhile this section is titled \"Auctions\", eBay (and similar services) have other types of listings including fixed price (Buy-It-Now), with or without optional \"Make Offer\", and others.\n\nHere are some specific laser related searches to get you started.
