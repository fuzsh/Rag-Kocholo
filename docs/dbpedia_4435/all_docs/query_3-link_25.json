By leveraging lightweight modules and freezing most parameters, MACP effectively utilizes cooperative observations, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches in both simulated and real-world cooperative perception benchmarks. üìäüåê Discover how MACP can revolutionize perception in CAVs and dramatically reduce the need for tuning parameters and communication costs. ü§ùüîç Don't miss out on this cutting-edge research! Access the full paper here: [link to blog post](https://bit.ly/3S9l4G6). üìëüíª Stay ahead of the curve with our groundbreaking work! üí°üåü If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out. ü§ù #CooperativePerception #ConnectedVehicles #CV #Research\n\nDr. Wolfgang Freese, Dr. Carsten Patz, Matthias Eng, Carlo van Driesten, Adam Molin, Martin T√∂rngren, Gilles Gallee, Dominik Seidel, Alex Mugnai and probably H√•kan Sivencrona and Siddartha Khastgir, looking forward to meeting you and many others next week in Berlin at OSS.5! I hope we find each other for a coffee ( or üçª) to discuss a question I have been thinking about recently: what are the innovation challenges in safety assessment behind the new DCAS regulation for very advanced ADAS systems?

The team can be found at Messe Munich Exhibition Center, Hall B2, Booth A10 on September 5-7 This is the first radar that can truly enrich perception algorithms, enhancing secured operation in all driving scenarios. Arbe‚Äôs technology has transformed radar as a sensor by infusing it with capabilities that were previously not compatible with radar. For more information and to schedule a demo, please click the link in the first comment. #arbe #automotivenews #autonomousdriving #automotiveindustry #IAAMobility #ImagingRadar #radarsensor #perceptionradar\n\nCheck out the new Indoor Mode for the BLK2FLY! Indoor Mode accomplishes three things: it does not require GNSS, obstacle avoidance is reduced to 1.5 meters, and it flies slower for maneuverability, which enables it to get closer to objects and fly in tight spaces. This long sought-after feature opens new scanning possibilities in indoor spaces such as arenas, plants, warehouses, and other facilities. So if an airborne SLAM platform to bridge the data gap from the outdoor world to the indoors is something that you've been looking for... Send me a message and we'll talk about this exciting new update. Let's make the BLK2FLY work for you! #BLK2FLY\n\nüì¢ What does the Future of Thermal entail?
