        "text": "Ultrapurple says:\n\nI think it's about time we opened a discussion on ThermViewer. For those who don't know, it a driver app for the ThermApp camera that, among other things, complements the 25Hz upgrade. One of its neatest tricks is that, with the addition of some other software and a bit of work on cooling and heating your Therm-App, you can produce new calibration files (1.bin etc) that work with ThermViewer and other Therm-App driver apps. Other features include superresolution upscaling, background (calibration) compensation, noise resuction and more. A big thank-you to Jinhua Ye for his efforts.\n\nApart from me, who else is using ThermViewer and what are your experiences of it?\n\n11:45AM, 26 August 2017 PDT\n\nUltrapurple says:\n\n@ geo_god_g The Therm-App Pro 640 x 480 isn't yet available. I have one on order and am expecting it around the end of September. The reason for the slight delay is that Opgal is adding a \"basic thermography\" capability to the device, which I guess is going to be similar to that in the regular Therm-App. The original announcement was that it was night vision only, so this is a significant improvement.\n\nI continue to be amazed by the fabulous images we're seeing from ThermViewer. I can only hope Jinhua.Ye makes it compatible with the Therm-App Pro when it becomes available - 1280 x 960 thermal videos would be awesome.\n\nOriginally posted 85 months ago.\n\nUltrapurple edited this topic 85 months ago.\n\nUltrapurple says:\n\nThere is one member of the group who I believe is based in China who says he can offer lenses of various focal lengths. I intended to get a 60mm lens from him but my money went on the Therm-App Pro instead!\n\n30 - 35mm lenses are expensive, there's no getting away from that. One cheaper option may be to keep your eyes open on the various auction sites for a \"germanium x3 telescope\". I have one and it works really well with the 19mm lens, see below. Click on the image to embiggen; there's a detailed description there too.\n\nOriginally posted 84 months ago.\n\nUltrapurple edited this topic 84 months ago.\n\nUltrapurple says:\n\nAccording to the Therm-App site, US$750 (plus shipping and any local import taxes).\n\nSee therm-app.com/product-category/accesories/\n\nIt's worth knowing that when I looked into it a couple of years ago this was significantly cheaper than I could buy the exact same lens from Umicore, who actually manufacture the lens. Here's its data page on the Unicore site:\n\neom.umicore.com/en/infrared-optics/products/thermal-imagi...\n\nOriginally posted 81 months ago.\n\nUltrapurple edited this topic 81 months ago.\n\nJinhua.Ye says:\n\nDark Volter:\n\nThere is only one version of it. Users who have not purchased a license are allowed to use the app within three days of each device (the mobile phone or the ThermApp camera). There is a five-minute restriction after three days. If you like this app, consider buying a license that follows a ThermApp camera and can be used on any supported phone or pad. You can contact me by email. Email:399327322@qq.com\n\nOriginally posted 78 months ago.\n\nJinhua.Ye edited this topic 78 months ago.\n\nchum_j says:\n\nJinhua.Ye:\n\nHello Jinhua\n\nI would like to use Thermviewer with my Therm app imager.\n\nI have tried it out with the trial (2.0.3) but cannot get it to work, as I thought it would.\n\nI am trying to lock the temperature range so that I can \"pan\" the scene and maintain the same colour format, to be able to visually compare the different temperature ranges from scene to scene.\n\nI have downloaded this file ThermViewer_Toolbar_use_instructions_en_v1.4 and I assumed it would be in English (en).\n\nI am afraid I can't view it in English it seems to be Chinese language.\n\nCan I get an english User Manual from somewhere.\n\nI'm afraid I'm lost wth trying to use the App and feel that If I perservered with trying to understand this one function I could maybe succeed only to be stopped by the next problem.\n\nA bit like \"Reinventing the wheel\" all on My own.\n\nThank You Jinhua Regards Chum\n\n77 months ago\n\nchum_j says:\n\nHello again Jinhua\n\nI have downloaded the thermviewer \"ThermViewer_Toolbar_use_instructions_en_v1.4\" directions about 5 times now and from 2 different areas, including the one on this blog page. I don't know what is wrong but I keep getting something I can't read.\n\nIf you don't mind I will send an email to you and attach a screen dump of what I am seeing when I open this file.\n\nIs there another source for the file that I can try, to get the instructions.\n\nThank You Jinhua Regards Chum\n\n76 months ago"
