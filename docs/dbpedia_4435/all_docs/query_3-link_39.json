        "text": "Micro-investing platform Wombat Invest is offering investors the opportunity to plug into the booming battery market with the launch of its latest theme-based ETF. ‘The Battery Boom’ fund offers exposure to companies capitalising on the growth in the adoption of battery and energy-storage solutions.\n\nAdvancements in battery technology are being fuelled by the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, which already account for more than half of global battery demand.\n\nThe fund provides investors with exposure to companies across the battery ecosystem, including those involved in raw materials mining, manufacturing, and emerging technologies such as autonomous driving.\n\nThe fund’s top 10 holdings include Plug Power Ltd, a developer of hydrogen fuel cell systems, Gangfeng Lithium Co Ltd, one of the world’s leading lithium producers, and Umicore, a materials company specialising in the automotive and energy sectors.\n\nThe fund is listed on the London Stock Exchange with the ticker CHRG and is the 26th ETF to be added to the Wombat platform. It has a total expense ratio of 0.4 per cent.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, Wombat has seen rapid growth as novice investors flock to access its range of theme-based exchange-traded funds and curated UK, US and EU fractional shares. It now has more than 160,000 users and 15 per cent month-on-month user growth.\n\nKane Harrison, chief executive and co-founder of Wombat Invest, said: “As concerns about climate change continue to mount attention is increasingly turning to the technologies that can help reduce carbon emissions from high polluting activities like road transportation and power production.\n\n“Batteries are critical to global energy transformation efforts and demand for them is only going to grow, not least from EV manufacturers as people continue to move away from vehicles powered by petrol and diesel.\n\n“With battery technology improving all the time, its importance can’t be overstated, and we are delighted to offer a thematic fund that provides investors access to the companies that have the highest potential for growth in what is an exciting emerging global megatrend.”"
