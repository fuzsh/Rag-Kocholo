Get Real.\n\nI currently have a gaylord of labtop screens just sitting around. Does anyone know of a good place to take this material. I just have never found a good buyer.\n\nWondering if anyone on here has done any Indium extraction? I have 25k lcd screens in process and the previous owner was sending them to an industial landfill From my reading sulfuric acid was was being used.\n\nIndium is a pain in the butt.\n\nIf you did that, you'd need to solvent extract it out and deal with a huge amount of waste.\n\nYou might just try Umicore.\n\nLou\n\nyou may also want to pop off some of those P4 processor tops (lga 486) there is indium under some types\n\nEDIT: this was a gift, was told it took forever to get it & they never want to do it again"
