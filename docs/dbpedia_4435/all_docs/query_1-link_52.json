It relies on a case study at the University of Rennes, in Western France, where the chemistry laboratory of Jacques Lucas conducted a program on non-oxide glass materials from the 1960s onwards. The chapter aims at explaining how the local production of these “exotic glasses” in Rennes was both shaped by a bench culture of solid-state chemistry and international R&D supported by the telecommunications industry.

        "text": "I would like to thank the two referees of this chapter for their careful reading and helpful comments and critics.\n\n3Thus, none of the three mentioned types of analytic literature provides a coherent theoretical apparatus that would encompass all the aspects of the historical case of Rennes. However, each of them points to one relevant scale of analysis: national administrations for science policy for innovation; specific places such as laboratories or start-ups for the “practical turn”; and global networks for the “triple-helix”. By following the glasses of Rennes over six decades (1960s-2010s), the chapter successively investigates these three scales of knowledge-making. The first part shows how national policy-makers shaped different disciplinarities for materials research, which organized a division of labor between Europe and the United States during the Cold War. The second part analyzes the local reconfiguration of research in Rennes, where the synthesis of non-oxide glasses at the bench and their mobilization by the telecommunications industry reshaped the practices of solid-state chemists towards a hybrid culture. These glasses were said to be “exotic” since they deeply differed from the mainstream glasses made of silica, a silicon oxide. The third part explores the “elsewhere” where bench materials would become brand products: the transnational triple-helix devoted to the building of fiber networks in competition with satellite communication. The fourth and last part goes back from brand to bench in a time of economic crisis to question the cultural changes in the knowledge-making of solid-state chemists through their connections with the telecommunications industry. The circulation of knowledge, instruments, and materials through the different scales of activity (local, national, global) provides a means for scientists to reshape their initial culture through the mobilization of economic, political and technological influences. Thus, the articulation between circulation and differentiation of materials and scientists can explain the making of knowledge.\n\n4The multi-scale narrative has required the multiplication of information sources, which explains the heterogeneity of the corpus: oral testimonies of scientists and administrators in materials research and fiber-optic communication; institutional archives from the laboratory of J. Lucas and a professional glass society in Rennes as well as from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Paris; scientific and technological literature, including selected readings and quantitative analyses from on-line databases of publications (Science Direct, Web of Knowledge) and patents (European Patent Office); secondary literature in the domains of history of science and technology, STS, and science policy. In spite of its patchwork nature, such an ad hoc corpus is liable to connect local specificities to global trends by gathering complementary information. On the local side, the epistemological study of knowledge-making is mainly extracted from oral archives and scientific articles. On the global side, the historical trends of telecommunication would have not been grasped without secondary literature. Between local and global approaches, the gap is sometimes big since business articles rarely go down to bench materials. Quantitative analysis provides a means to bridge the gap in-between.\n\n1. National Policy-Making and the International Division of Labor in Materials Research\n\n1.1. The Cold War Policy of Materials Science and Engineering in the United States\n\n6The US federal government implemented MSE as a new academic entity in response to the 1957 Sputnik success of the Soviets. Around $200 million were spent by the Department of Defense over a decade (1961-1970) to fund fifteen Interdisciplinary Laboratories (later Materials Research Laboratories), as well as training programs in top-rank universities, including MIT and Stanford (Leslie, 1993). The idea was to foster fundamental solid-state research oriented towards industrial applications. It was modeled after the 1930s example of AT&T Bell Labs (Hoddeson, 1977). Collaborative research between chemists, crystallographers, electricians, engineers, mechanics, metallurgists, and physicists was organized towards the design of advanced materials for strategic domains. The epistemology of MSE defined an integrated tetrahedron of four elements: process, structure, property, and performance. In addition, materials scientists distinguished between “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” properties (Goodenough, 2001, p. 22). The former were induced by the composition and structure of inner matter while the latter were more related to the performance of the end product through the optimization of several parameters (shape, morphology, doping level, purity, etc.). Training programs taught these considerations to several hundred graduate students throughout the country. The annual number of awarded PhD in materials science multiplied ten-fold in two decades, from around 30 in 1970 to 300 in 1990, at the expanse of metallurgy (Groenewegen & Peters, 2002, p. 129-130). In the same period, the number of MSE research centers multiplied five-fold, from around 20 to almost 100. Composite materials dominated the research field during the same period (Bensaude Vincent, 2001). A special emphasis was put on the study of solid-state structures, including structural defects. Industrial companies and state governments joined the military during the 1970s in funding the research field. Another institutional step was the foundation in 1973 of the Materials Research Society. Its membership increased from 300 at the beginning to around 1,000 in 1980 and 10,000 in 1990 (Philips, 2016). Fall and spring meetings gathered an audience of the same order of magnitude twice a year in the US.\n\n7In spite of the interdisciplinary rhetoric, MSE was under the symbolic domination of physics. In particular, solid-state physicists were widely supported by military agencies during the Cold War, even if they retained the latitude to perform fundamental research (Martin, 2013, p. 240-245). There were around 2,000 researchers according to the 1973 American Men and Women of Science. Between 200 and 400 PhDs were annually awarded in solid-state physics during the 1970s. On the contrary, chemistry was “perceived as playing a supporting role in materials science, and a relatively unexciting one at that” (Whitesides et al., 1987, p. 204). Chemists mostly performed optimization, purification, and design of well-known compounds. Indeed, less than 50 PhDs in ceramics were awarded per year in the last three decades of the twentieth century. The American Men and Women of Science identified around 70 solid-state chemists in 1973.\n\n1.2. The Disciplinary Organization of Solid-State Research in Continental Europe\n\n9Materials research was mainly driven in Europe by industrial R&D and academic disciplines, including chemistry, crystallography, physics and metallurgy. In particular, solid-state physicists and chemists formed two equivalently strong communities of research and education in European universities (Teissier, 2014). They became institutionalized during the second part of the twentieth century. Solid-state physics was modeled on the US community (Pestre, 2004). Their disciplinary matrix was made of three elements: X-ray diffraction, structure-property relationship, and quantum theory of solids (Weart, 1992).\n\n11In Continental Europe, materials research was driven by solid-state physics and chemistry, which tended to favor the study of “intrinsic” properties rather than “extrinsic” ones (Simon, 2005, p. 4). The institutional autonomy of both academic disciplines explained why their approaches differed from each other. Solid-state physicists, who were more interested in the characterization of “purified phenomena”, adopted a global description of matter. On the contrary, solid-state chemists, who were more interested in making “dirty materials”, preferred to focus on the local arrangement of atoms, seen as geometrical blocks (triangle, tetrahedron, octahedron) composing crystals (Pouchard, 2004, p. 10). Such a differentiation allowed them to collaborate in a complementary way: physicists performed the most subtle characterization of properties and proposed theoretical models while chemists provided new solid compounds with original atomic arrangements. This academic organization was typical of continental Europe, even if materials research was also conducted by industrial companies, Philips being the most famous in the Netherlands. On the contrary, “in the English-speaking world, where academic ‘departments’ [were] normal, no departments of either solid-state physics or of solid-state chemistry [were] to be found” (Cahn, 2001, p. 46).\n\n1.3. The Western Division of Labor of Materials Research in the Cold War\n\n1.4. The Bench Culture of Solid-State Chemistry in Rennes\n\n14French solid-state chemists contributed to the international division of labor by making numerous original compounds. In particular, the University of Rennes, in Western France, published two star-materials. It hosted five small chemistry groups that studied inorganic solid compounds in the late 1960s (Ministère de l’Industrie, 1966, p. 258). It was a time of expansion and specialization in French academia. Science policy favored the integration of small groups into big centers. The CNRS was in charge of the reorganization. The CNRS was the national research agency established in 1939 to organize French academic research, both generally and at the laboratory level. Over three decades (1949-1982), its number of employees increased by a factor of 10, from 2,420 technicians and researchers to 23,000, and its budget by a factor of 40 (Picard, 1990, p. 214). The CNRS missions were to manage its own laboratories on specific research and to distribute its employees in university laboratories to strengthen French academic research. In 1965-1966, a new category of association with the CNRS was created to provide extra funds and means to university laboratories with sufficient size and quality.\n\n15This science policy led to the gathering of the five research groups of Rennes into one single unit of research and education devoted to “structures and properties of the matter”. This unit received the CNRS association label in 1975 to become the Laboratory of Chemistry and Crystallochemistry of the Elements of Transition (CNRS, 1975). Jacques Prigent was the laboratory director. However, each research group kept its autonomy under the leadership of a professor: Jean Lang (1927-2014), Dominique Weisel, Daniel Grandjean and Jacques Lucas (born in 1937). Each was specialized in mineral, physical, or crystal chemistry, which contributed to mixing these sub-cultures of chemistry in Prigent’s laboratory. There, two materials that became known worldwide were produced in the early 1970s.\n\n2. The Local Reconfiguration of Solid-State Chemistry towards Glass Materials\n\n2.1. The Solid-State Chemistry Group of Jacques Lucas\n\n17The research group of Jacques Lucas emerged from the French academic expansion of the 1960s (Picard, 1990, p. 209-234). In 1964, Lucas completed his PhD on uranium complexes under Prigent. He went on in inorganic chemistry during his military service. By chance, he was attached to the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), a public body that led both civilian and military research and development on atomic energy and materials, where he was in charge of a small research group in Saclay, near Paris (Lucas, 2005, p. 4). He was lucky to learn fluorine chemistry in a wealthy laboratory at a time when it was unusual for young draft scientists to do research. This two-year CEA experience oriented Lucas towards fluoride crystals when he was appointed associate-professor in Rennes in 1966. A charismatic leader, Lucas took advantage of the academic university to gather a dozen PhD students and technicians in the early 1970s. He also relied on CNRS funding to buy instruments, hire technicians, and find grants for PhD students.\n\n19The arrangement of the research group around a pyrochlore ball-and-stick model, which mimicked a soccer team around the ball, indicated the central place played by these structures. To study them, Lucas and his collaborators applied the “disciplinary matrix” of solid-state chemistry: high-temperature synthesis, bulk crystals, and structural analysis (Lucas, 2005, p. 15). Basically, mineral powders were mixed, put in a sealed nickel tube to prevent oxidation from air, and heated in a furnace for one to three days at around 1,000°C (Poulain et al., 1972, p. 319). The cooling down allowed the melt to crystallize in one or several structures. Following the 1960s trends in crystallochemistry, Lucas’s group had two means to prepare new series of compounds. Firstly, two or three reagents (Zr – UF4 – ZrF4) were combined in different proportions to form unexpected products: UZrF7 and UZr2F11 (Fonteneau & Lucas, 1974). Secondly, in a well-known compound like fluorozirconate (MZrF6), chemical elements were alternatively substituted for each other (M could be Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) (Poulain & Lucas, 1970, p. 822). Besides structural analysis by X-ray diffraction, crystals could also be characterized through physical measurements if specific magnetic or spectroscopic properties were expected.\n\n2.2. The Local Making of Heavy-Metal Fluoride Glasses by the Poulain Brothers\n\n20The solid-state chemistry routine for pyrochlore structures was disrupted by the tandem work of two brothers from Lucas’s team: Marcel Poulain (the second one from the right in the top row of Figure 1) and Michel Poulain (the last one on the left at the bottom). The youngest one, Marcel (born in 1945), was the first to join Lucas’s group in 1967 after a curriculum in electronics and chemistry in Rennes. He submitted a university thesis on earth alkali fluorozirconates in 1970 and a doctorate on transition metal fluorozirconates in 1973 under Lucas’s supervision. When a technical position opened in the laboratory, Marcel advised his elder brother, who was jobless in spite of a physics degree, to apply (Poulain & Poulain, 2015, p. 2).\n\n21Michel (born in 1935) was hired as a technician for the operation and maintenance of X-ray and magnetic instruments. All worked so well that he had spare time to pass certificates in chemistry and electronics. He could even submit a university thesis in 1972 on the spectroscopic and structural characterizations of rare earth fluorozirconates (Poulain, 1972). The physical properties were studied through a multidisciplinary collaboration with Pierre Brun (born in 1934) from the neighboring Laboratory of Quantum Electronics (Brun et al., 1973). Michel thus contributed to Lucas’s group research on laser applications. Lucas let him conduct part-time research with his brother probably because they were as skilled as they were independent and stubborn. In spite of his physics background, Michel preferred chemical syntheses. He quickly learned how to screen hundreds of compositions a month by proceeding dirtily in the first round (Poulain & Poulain, 2015, p. 1-5). His intuitions and trial and error empirical methods led him to define the most promising compositions, on which he spent more time. From his thesis, he extracted neodymium fluorozirconates (NdZrF7) with fluorescent properties that sounded promising for laser applications. The lack of reproducibility of his results led Michel to work on this composition in 1974. After one trial, he got back from the furnace a centimeter long colorless solid instead of the usual smaller and darker compounds. When analyzed by X-ray diffraction, only rays of neodymium fluoride (NdF3) appeared, which suggested that this reagent did not react. The lack of other signals suggested that the three other reagents (ZrF4, BaF2, NaF) led to amorphous compounds. The colorlessness and the size of the product strengthened the suspicion: a glass instead of a crystal had been synthesized. The result was unexpected in a program devoted to pyrochlore structures.\n\n22However, the accident was attractive for two reasons. Firstly, the Poulain brothers were excited by having found a new type of heavy-metal fluoride glass while only two other cases had been reported with lighter elements (BeF2, AlF3). They performed more systematic syntheses and drew a ternary diagram (ZrF4 – BaF2 – NaF). A ternary diagram provided a visual tool to mark out the stability domains of the different structures that could be made by from the variable compositions of the three components. Figure 2 shows the chemical and structural map of the compound with the amorphous domain in the middle of the diagram.\n\n23Once he had been alerted, Lucas stressed a second reason to go on in this direction. As a team leader, he thought about the possible use of glasses for optical applications, which would provide new funding opportunities. Yet, while public funding had been stagnating since the early 1970s, the 1973 economic crisis had made the general context worse. More specifically, the academic competition was rough in French solid-state chemistry (Teissier, 2010, p. 239-248). University national committees and CNRS commissions were dominated by powerful mandarins such as Jacques Bénard (1912-1987), Robert Collongues (1924-1998), Michel Fayard (born 1928), Paul Hagenmuller, and André Michel (1909-2000). These elites tended to keep means, honors and positions for their own laboratories while small groups from the provinces like Lucas’s team experienced hard times in the 1970s (Caro, 2005, p. 12). Both the epistemic search for originality and the marginality in a competitive academic environment led Lucas’s group to shift from the crystal-based tradition of French solid-state chemistry to the unknown domain of optical glasses, while hoping for industrial applications. Their choice was strengthened by positive signals coming from the international telecommunications industry.\n\n2.3. How the Economic Crisis and Industrial Hopes Turned Academic Chemists towards MSE\n\n24The international mainstream of solid-state chemistry was still firmly grounded in the study of well-organized solids during the 1970s for both instrumental and industrial reasons. Indeed, X-ray diffraction had become the central tool for solid-state characterizations since the 1930s, which discarded less-organized solids like glasses. In addition, most high-technology industries relied on crystalline materials, including semi-conductors and composite materials. The “hope of applications” for amorphous materials slowly changed the situation from the 1960s onwards (Mazières, 1978, p. 10). The success of the Journal of Non Crystalline Solids established in 1968 highlighted the interest of the academic community at the end of the decade.\n\n2.4. From Bench to Brand: the Economic Activity of Le Verre Fluoré\n\n30There was a third consequence in Rennes resulting from the shift towards optical fibers. Lucas and the Poulains, who wanted to turn academic finding into profits, established a start-up company outside the university in 1977: Le Verre Fluoré. The incorporated company was led by Gwénael Mazé, Marcel Poulain’s friend. Local businessmen (B. Angon, Y. Le Met) helped them to start, before the stocks were shared by the Mazé family and the Poulain family (Poulain, 2015, p. 14-15). Two graduates in technological chemistry from Rennes, Vincent Cardin and Jean-Yves Carré, were hired to conduct in-house R&D. They could rely on the laboratory’s expertise until Lucas and Mazé quarreled. Then, they were helped by the Poulains, who remained involved in Le Verre Fluoré. This made them isolated, if not in trouble, in Lucas’s group. The gap between the laboratory and the company increased in the 1980s.\n\n3. Global University-Industry-Government Triple-Helix of Non-Oxide Glasses\n\n33The fluoride glasses of Rennes contributed, with other exotic glasses (chalcogenides, halides), to stimulate international R&D on non-oxide glass materials for optical fibers during the 1980s. Multinational telecommunications companies and US military agencies organized the triple-helix integrating universities, industries and states in America, Asia, and Europe. Conventional glass-manufacturers on the contrary did not provide much innovation for non-oxide glass materials (Kurkjian and Prindle, 1998, p. 810).\n\n34The triple-helix was framed by two competitions. Inside fiber-optic communication, exotic glasses competed with classical glasses made of silica. Yet Corning and other glass-manufacturers invested several $100 million to design commercial fibers whose attenuation gradually decreased, from 20dB/km ca. 1970 to 1 ca. 1980 and 0.2 ca. 1990 (Cohendet et al., 1987, p. 264). In addition, besides fiber-optic networks, the telecommunications industry built satellite communication networks (Marandi, 1988). The techno-economic choices were not just induced by the performance of single materials but by the “evolution of large technological systems” (Hughes, 1987). Indeed, in a given communication network, each part had to be tuned to all others. For fiber systems, optical cables linked emitting devices (lasers, diodes) to processing devices (electronic computers) through a complex network of nodes (amplifiers, repeaters) and microwave phenomena (Faltas, 1988). Such systemic competition might explain why telecommunications companies kept on asking for better performance: each “reverse salient” was thought to endanger the whole system. The triple-helix around exotic glasses benefited from this systemic competition.\n\n35This led experts to overstate the need for reducing fiber attenuation and increasing information speed. AT&T was driven by the example of the electronics industry where Moore’s law displayed decades of exponential growth in processor speed (Brock, 2006). In the early 1980s, it was in charge, with Standard Telephone and Cables and Alcatel, of installing the first transoceanic fiber cable: TAT8 would be in operation in 1988 between America (Tuckerton, NJ) and Europe (Widemouth, UK and Penmarch, France) for a $300 million budget. AT&T advertised that TAT8 would carry the equivalent of 37,800 virtual voice channels with a 25% reduction cost per voice compared with the 1983 electric wire TAT7 (Jeffcoat et al., 1984). If repeaters were put every 60km with TAT8, industrial experts and materials scientists announced that the replacement of silica fibers by fluoride glasses in “the next generation of transoceanic cables” might even avoid the need for repeaters (Westwood and Winzer, 1987, p. 257). The prognostications caused the silica fiber market to expand quickly to reach $2,4 billion in the late 1980s.\n\n3.1. Knowledge Circulation Channels in Exotic Glass R&D\n\n40It was the time when the International Symposium on Halide Glasses was launched. The number of publications and patents peaked a first time in 1988 (44 items) and a second time in 1993 (66). The analysis of NOGS News exhibited the same trend for non-oxide glasses: the number of related publications was multiplied by two and half from 1987 (180 items) to 1997 (450) (NOGS, 1987-1997). The decrease of 1988-1990 can be explained by the funding shift, especially in the US, toward the booming field of high temperature superconductors after 1986 (Poulain & Poulain, 2015, 18). On the contrary, the patenting process increased until 1996. It was led by Japanese companies, which registered more than 60% of the 400 patents on non-oxide glasses during the 1987-1997 decade (NOGS, 1987-1997). From the mid-1990s, there was a decreasing trend in publishing and patenting on fluoride glasses: the number of both articles and patents fell by two thirds from 1996 to 2002 (from 54 items to 17).\n\n3.2. The Dispersion of the Fluoride Fiber R&D\n\n41The 1990s decrease can be explained by two reasons. The first was that R&D efforts converged in the late 1980s toward a consensus on the composition of fiber glasses when the attenuation of silica fibers dropped around 0.2dB/km. The optimized composition of fluoride glass was named ZBLAN for the five elements involved: Zr, Ba, La, Al, Na. It was a delicate balance made of 53ZrF4 – 20BaF2 – 4LaF3 – 3AlF3 – 20NaF. ZBLAN was strikingly close to the chemical composition of one glass published in the seminal paper of Poulain (et al., 1975): 50ZrF4 – 20BaF2 – 5NdF3 – 25NaF. In-between, fifteen years of optimization turned fluoride glasses into commercial fibers with a broader transparency window (from 0.4 to 5 microns) and the required design. Several tens of millions of dollars had been spent in the same time around the world to foster non-oxide glass R&D (Poulain & Poulain, 2015, p. 16). Fluoride glasses became brand products for high-technology niches in the 1990s: interferometry astronomy, laser medical applications, and military infrared devices. Profit expectations were reduced accordingly. In spite of their “intrinsic” properties, fluoride glasses proved difficult to purify and manufacture at low cost. Their “extrinsic” properties forbade them the mass-market contrary to silica fibers. Their study became less stimulating and the triple-helix diversified fiber-glass compositions, once dominated by fluoride types, towards other halides, chalcogenides, oxy-halogenides, and oxy-nitrides. The evolution was embodied by the 1994 renaming of the symposium to “International Symposium on Non-Oxide Glasses”. For the first time in 12 years, the symposium was organized in Asia, China being the host.\n\n42The second reason was linked to economic trends that favored short-term profits at the expanse of R&D funding during the two last decades of the century: “financialization of the economy” (Pestre, 2003, p. 83); liberalization and privatization of telecommunications in Western countries (Bartle, 2002). The effect was enhanced in the early 1990s by the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Industrial innovation, which had been strategic in the Cold War, appeared less profitable. It was all the more the case in fiber optics, where thesilica market for terrestrial and oceanic telecommunication networks had quickly expanded: around 100 million kilometers of silica fibers were installed up to the late 1990s (Kurkjian and Krol, 1998).\n\n43The rate of silica-fiber installation was around 5 million kilometers per year when the dot-com bubble, boosted by the world wide web, collapsed in March 2000. The burst of the bubble on the New York Stock Exchange sounded the death knell for fluoride glass R&D since major multinational companies withdrew. Large companies stopped their manufacture of fluoride fibers: AT&T, British Telecom, Galileo Electro-Optics, Naval Research Laboratory, NTT (Poulain and Poulain, 2015, p. 18). Small companies continued to compete in small space, military and medical niches: Le Verre Fluoré in France, ThorLabs in the US, FiberLabs in Japan. The “communism” feelings did not survive the lack of funding. The triple-helix around exotic glasses was sharply reorganized, which stimulated the circulation of researchers. In the US, when telecommunications companies like AT&T closed their high-quality R&D centers, dismissed researchers found academic jobs in university laboratories (Lucas, 2005, 14-15). In Rennes, when the brand optimization came to an end, chemists went back to the bench to carry on glass chemistry.\n\n4. Back to Bench: Chemical Skills for Materials Science in the Third Millennium\n\n44Lucas’s group became an independent Laboratory of Glasses and Ceramics in 1992. In spite of its close acquaintance with the triple-helix of non-oxide glass materials, it never broke with chemistry. On the professional level, its members kept their affiliation with the chemistry department of the University of Rennes. On the epistemic level, MSE made them aware of the design of materials, including the importance of “extrinsic” properties, but they remained experts in the making of new compounds, not the optimization of well-known materials. Actually, the circulation from crystallochemistry to glass materials shaped new interdisciplinary practices between solid-state chemistry and MSE. The researchers from Lucas’s group were bench chemists since they highly valued the synthesis of original compounds while chemists in MSE were supposed to optimize well-known compounds. They were also materials scientists since their syntheses were oriented towards the expected performances of brand products. The customized design of tellurium halide glasses (TeX) for military cameras and astronomy devices gives a good example to analyze the chemical creativity in an industry-driven academic research.\n\n4.1. Bench Creativity and Interdisciplinary Practices\n\n46The second tool was the periodic table, which, one century after Mendeleev, remained the “catechism” of solid-state chemists (Lucas, 2005, p. 17). It was read dynamically by circulating along the lines, the columns and the diagonals of the table. The substitution of one element for another in the reagents was oriented by the relative position of their respective squares giving their properties (size, electronegativity). The bench success was linked to the chemist’s aptitude for reading the table according to his own memory of the past trials and errors.\n\n47The third tool was crystallochemistry. Indeed, if amorphous solids do not have a long-range order, they exhibit short-range arrangements of atoms. This local order was pictured by former solid-state chemists like the geometrical blocks (triangle, tetrahedron, octahedron) composing crystals. Let us remember the central role for Lucas’s team in the early 1970s of the pyrochlore structure by noting the ball-and-stick model in Figure 1. Lucas and his coworkers could thus imagine the modification of optical properties of glasses by modifying their local arrangements.\n\n4.2. Strategic Materials for Military Devices\n\n49In 1984, the French military R&D agency (DGA) contracted Lucas to make a glass transmitting light in the infrared transparency window of the terrestrial atmosphere (8-12 microns). A Chinese student, Xiang Hua Zhang, was hired by Lucas on a 3-year PhD grant (1984-1987). They found completely new tellurium halide glasses (TeX), whose transparency window was 2-20 microns, wider than the initial specifications (NOGS, 1988, p. 3). This was a new class of materials, known as TeX glasses or Texglass. Ten years after the fluoride experience, the laboratory held expertise in optics and MSE to design “molded lenses” for night vision infrared cameras. Just as for glasses, a decade (1986-1996) was necessary to complete the composition optimization and reach the performances required for optical, thermal and mechanical properties. Patents were taken with CNRS.\n\n50Zhang launched a start-up company, Vertex, with Lucas’s benediction. The context of technology transfer was better in France in the late 1990s than in the 1970s. The 1999 “law on innovation” of the minister of Education and Research, Claude Allègre, eased the founding of start-ups from academic research (Lucas, 2005, p. 10-11). Regional authorities (Bretagne), private investors (banks, joint venture, Umicore) and Lucas invested in the company capital. The business was profitable but the production limited. Umicore was the direct competitor of Vertex, through an alternative technology of infrared germanium lenses. It soon acquired Vertex. The multinational company would implement a change of production scale. The research program, commissioned and funded by the French State, through DGA, and carried out by public institutions (University of Rennes and CNRS), enriched both the first stockholders of Vertex (including the inventors) and one multinational company (Umicore). The infrared cameras based on the TeX lens found at Rennes would equip the French Army and expensive car models of BMW and Cadillac.\n\n51The accidental synthesis of fluoride glasses by the Poulains brothers in the mid-1970s was turned into an original program in the synthesis and design of non-oxide glass materials. The program hybridized the disciplinary matrix of solid-state chemistry towards the bench synthesis of new glasses (instead of new crystals) and the design of optical materials by adapting MSE practices to a chemistry laboratory. It was rewarded by the election of Lucas at the Academy of Sciences in 2004.\n\n5. Conclusions: Chemical Skills, Division of Labor, and Innovation in Materials Research\n\n52This case study on exotic glasses of Rennes exhibits three major features of materials research in the second part of the twentieth century: an international division of labor; an economic dynamic of innovation; and a disciplinary differentiation of knowledge.\n\n53Firstly, materials research was strongly framed by the science policy of national governments during the twentieth century. Materials research was mainly conducted through a disciplinary organization of solid-state physics and chemistry in continental Europe while the US built interdisciplinary programs in MSE to link fundamental solid-state physics to industrial requirements. These national differences in science-policy contributed to an international division of labor in the Western world during the Cold War: new solid compounds were more often synthesized by European chemists while new solid-state properties were more often characterized by American physicists and materials scientists. This provided two advantages for the US over their European allies: the symbolic capital to study “purified phenomena” instead of preparing “dirty materials”; and the economic and strategic capital to turn promising bench compounds into brand devices for industrial and military domains.\n\n54The University of Rennes exhibited two attitudes with regards to the international organization of materials research in the 1970s. The group of J. Prigent accepted the division of labor: it synthesized new crystals (Chevrel’s phases) and the group of B. Matthias at Bell Labs displayed their superconducting properties in the US. On the contrary, the group of J. Lucas synthesized an exotic glass and displayed its original optical properties. Then, it joined a triple-helix of university-industry-government around non-oxide glasses to escape its marginal position in French solid-state chemistry and contributed to the innovative design of exotic materials.\n\n55Secondly, the economic dynamic of innovation in advanced materials is based on the articulation of competition and cooperation, i.e. “coopetition”. There were two types of competition in the telecommunications race. On the one hand, US and NATO military agencies funded optic-fiber R&D until the end of the Cold War to beat the Warsaw Pact countries. On the other hand, multinational companies, from Asian, European or US origins, funded R&D on communication networks to beat their competitors during the dot-com bubble of the neoliberal age. The public image of Mertonian “communism” could not survive the funding decrease of the 1990s. Secrecy played its crucial role in partitioning knowledge.\n\n56However, secrecy went side by side with a quick circulation of knowledge, practice, equipment and money for medical, military, space, and telecommunications materials. The innovation backstage was full of actors with a huge variety of size, temporality and goals: the secretary of the Non Oxide Glass Society, who edits NOG News (budget of $10,000 annually); the start-up companies with 2-3 employees ($500,000); the academic laboratory ($2,000,000); the International Symposium on Non-Oxide Glasses; R&D centers from several multinational companies ($100,000,000) and national research centers (CNRS); military institutions (DGA, NATO); and states, including France, UK, and the US. The advancement of materials was reached through the collaboration between universities, industries, civil and military agencies.\n\n57The interaction between public and private agents played a special role in the collaborative process. The technology transfer from public academe to private industry was made easier from the mid-1970s (Le Verre Fluoré) to the late 1990s (Vertex). This was induced in France by the relative decrease in public R&D funding from the early 1970s, prior to the US Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. The impression given by Lucas’s group is that the public revenue funded most of the total budget, including the salaries of scholars accounting for three quarters of the total, while industrial contracts, either civil or military, oriented research. The case of Vertex is of particular interest in this respect: the funding was 100% public (through Education and Army) while the start-up was bought by the dominant company on the market: Umicore. For the sake of strategic options and economic impetus, administrations supported material glasses for the benefit of private companies.\n\n58Last but not least, the division of labor and the dynamics of innovation relied on the disciplinary differentiation of knowledge. The choices of Lucas’s group required the reinvention of the research portfolio along two epistemic shifts. On the one hand, crystallo-chemistry was turned into glass-chemistry to nourish a synthetic creativity in the making of glass compounds. On the other hand, the optimization and design of fibers became a routine activity to increase the optical performance of glass materials. The cross-fertilization of synthetic creativity and materials design favored the understanding of chemical canons (furnaces, old-fashioned literature, periodic Bible, crystallochemistry) with fresh eyes. In addition, thousands of trials and errors, thorough instrumental characterizations, contradictory discussions, and total failures were also needed for Michel and Marcel Poulain as well as Jacques Lucas and Xiang Hua Zhang to create – by imagination and actual making – new forms of glasses: heavy-metal fluorides and tellurium halide glasses. The chemical skills of the group cannot be understood without the subtle association of creative gestures (arts) and repetitive practices (sciences).\n\n59Contrary to Prigent’s group, Lucas’s laboratory modified its disciplinary identity of solid-state chemistry and changed its place in the international division of labor. From then on, it both provided new compounds and characterized them. It was emblematic of a wider evolution that worried American scholars and, probably, policy-makers. Indeed, European and Japanese solid-state chemists had increased their interest in physical characterization in the 1980s (Di Salvo, 1987, p. 165). The interaction of academic chemists with MSE was stimulated by the decrease in public funding during the economic crisis of the 1970s. Since US chemists did not show much interest in the art of creation in chemistry, the dominant position of the US in the division of labor was threatened."
