        "text": "Kinetics Analysis\n\nThe Mafart-Weibull model was used for describing the thermal resistance because it models both linear and nonlinear trends of inactivation kinetics in simple parameters with good fitness (\n\nAlbert and Mafart, 2005\n\nAlbert I.\n\nMafart P.\n\nA modified Weibull model for bacterial inactivation.\n\n):\n\nlog(N/N0)=−(t/δ)α\n\n[1]\n\nwhere N and N0 are population counts (cfu/g) at times t and 0, respectively; t is the time of the isothermal treatment (min) after CUT; δ refers to the overall steepness of the survival curve; and α describes the general shape of the curve and whether it is linear (α = 1) or nonlinear (α ≠ 1) with a decreasing (α < 1) or increasing (α > 1) inactivation rate with time. When the survivor curve shows a linear trend (α ≈ 1), equation [1] can also be used as the first-order kinetic model (equation [2];\n\nGaillard et al., 1998\n\nGaillard S.\n\nLeguérinel I.\n\nMafart P.\n\nModel for combined effects of temperature, pH and water activity on thermal inactivation of Bacillus cereus spores.\n\n):\n\nlog(N/N0)=−(t/δ)1=−t/D,\n\n[2]\n\nwhere D is the time (min) required to reduce the microbial population by 10-fold at a specified temperature (°C). Thus, δ-values could be the starting point of a secondary modeling and the zT-value required to change the D value of target microorganisms by 90% (1 log) in specific LMF could be determined by equation [3] (\n\nGaillard et al., 1998\n\nGaillard S.\n\nLeguérinel I.\n\nMafart P.\n\nModel for combined effects of temperature, pH and water activity on thermal inactivation of Bacillus cereus spores.\n\n;\n\nLeguérinel and Mafart, 2001\n\nLeguérinel I.\n\nMafart P.\n\nModelling the influence of pH and organic acid types on thermal inactivation of Bacilluscereus spores.\n\n):\n\nzT=T2−T1log(D1/D2).\n\n[3]\n\nwhere D1 and D2 are the time (min) required to reduce 1-log of the microbial population at temperature T1 and T2, respectively. When the regressions were used to correlate the log counts of bacteria with time, a pseudo-coefficient of determination was calculated using the equation\n\nR2=1−∑1n(Yi−Yˆi)2∑1n(Yi−Y¯)2,\n\n[4]\n\nwhere Yi is the log10 count of bacteria,Yˆi is the log10 count estimated by equation [1],Y¯ is the mean of the log10 count of bacteria, and n is the number of data points of an inactivation curve. The integrated pathogen modeling program (\n\nHuang, 2014\n\nHuang L.\n\nIPMP 2013—A comprehensive data analysis tool for predictive microbiology.\n\n) was used for generating thermal resistance parameters in equation [1]. Differences between δ-values among samples were evaluated using ANOVA in Minitab 14 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA).\n\nEffect of Dry Carriers on Bacterial Survivability and Thermal Resistance\n\nTo achieve the same inoculation level of 8.2 ± 0.2 log cfu/g before storage test and isothermal inactivation studies, the ratio of the amounts of the starting aqueous inoculum and final inoculated NFMP samples prepared by the 2 carriers was different: 1 mL to 30 g of NFMP for SiO2-microorganisms and 1 mL to 100 g of NFMP for NFMP-microorganisms. These 2 ratios were determined from a preliminary test, from which bacterial survival rates were observed to be different. Both strain sets in 10 g of SiO2 retained lower bacterial populations, and the population loss in the SiO2 drying process lead to higher microbial thermal resistance.\n\nIn the storage tests, microorganisms prepared by both inoculation methods maintained strong survivability during 30 d following equilibration. Stable survivability of 2 bacterial sets was also observed from previous studies in nut kernels (\n\nBlessington et al., 2013\n\nBlessington T.\n\nTheofel C.G.\n\nHarris L.J.\n\nA dry-inoculation method for nut kernels.\n\n) and wheat flour (\n\nVilla Rojas, 2015\n\nVilla Rojas R.\n\nInfluence of different factors on desiccation survival and thermal resistance of Salmonella and radiofrequency pasteurization of low-moisture foods. PhD Diss.\n\n;\n\nXu et al., 2018\n\nXu J.\n\nLiu S.\n\nSong J.\n\nTang J.\n\nZhu M.\n\nGray P.\n\nRojas R.V.\n\nDry-inoculation method for thermal inactivation studies in wheat ﬂour using freeze-dried Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354.\n\n). The suggested time of using E. faecium-inoculated almonds was 30 d from the date of inoculation (\n\nAlmond Board of California (ABC), 2014\n\nAlmond Board of California (ABC)\n\nGuidelines for using Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 as a surrogate microorganism in almond process validation.\n\n).\n\nIn NFMP, SiO2-Salmonella displayed much stronger heat resistance than NFMP-Salmonella (P < 0.05). This difference in thermal inactivation might have been the result of the different conditioning histories of microorganisms in the 2 carriers (e.g., affected by nutrient content, drying rate, inoculum size). The different rate of drying and the different environment during drying is relevant to the survivors before thermal treatments and, hence, their thermal resistances. The presence of compatible solutes (including disaccharides, such as lactose) and the presence of dead cells during drying can substantially alter desiccation tolerance and heat resistance of desiccated cells by altering the composition of cytoplasmic solutes (\n\nDoyle et al., 1985\n\nDoyle M.P.\n\nMeske L.M.\n\nMarth E.H.\n\nSurvival of Listeria monocytogenes during the manufacture and storage of nonfat dry milk.\n\n). The differential effect of the 2 drying methods on heat resistance of Salmonella and E. faecium further substantiate that organism-dependent factors (e.g., accumulation or synthesis of compatible solutes) rather than process-driven factors account for the difference (\n\nPodolak et al., 2010\n\nPodolak R.\n\nEnache E.\n\nStone W.\n\nBlack D.G.\n\nElliott P.H.\n\nSources and risk factors for contamination, survival, persistence, and heat resistance of Salmonella in low-moisture foods.\n\n;\n\nGruzdev et al., 2011\n\nGruzdev N.\n\nPinto R.\n\nSela S.\n\nEffect of dessication on tolerance of Salmonella enterica to multiple stresses.\n\n).\n\nSuch large differences of thermal inactivation kinetics of microorganisms prepared by 2 methods would have a major effect on process validation. In our study, the aqueous inoculation method resulted in lower thermal resistance of the target pathogen (Table 1); however, many researchers have used this method to estimate thermal resistance of Salmonella in LMF and applied the results in the design of thermal processes (\n\nBari et al., 2009\n\nBari M.L.\n\nNei D.\n\nSotome I.\n\nNishina I.\n\nIsobe S.\n\nKawamoto S.\n\nEffectiveness of sanitizers, dry heat, hot water, and gas catalytic infrared heat treatments to inactivate Salmonella on almonds.\n\n;\n\nJeong et al., 2009\n\nJeong S.\n\nMarks B.P.\n\nOrta-Ramirez A.\n\nThermal inactivation kinetics for Salmonella Enteritidis PT30 on almonds subjected to moist-air convection heating.\n\n;\n\nLiu et al., 2017\n\nLiu S.\n\nOzturk S.\n\nXu J.\n\nKong F.\n\nGray P.\n\nZhu M.-j.\n\nSablani S.S.\n\nTang J.\n\nMicrobial validation of radio frequency pasteurization of wheat flour by inoculated pack studies.\n\n). These treatments might be sufficient to control pathogens in LMF only if the aqueous inoculation method reflects the natural contamination. Full investigation of possible contamination routes is needed to assess the efficiency of current process validation procedure.\n\nThermal inactivation kinetics of SiO2- and NFMP-E. faecium in NFMP were different, as described by α values. The population of NFMP-E. faecium was stable at the beginning of heat treatment and declined rapidly at a certain point (e.g., inactivation rate increased suddenly at 95°C, 50 min). Chemical reactions and quality degradation may occur in NFMP during thermal treatments and thus influence inactivation rates of inherent microorganisms. The NFMP inoculated by NFMP-microorganisms showed color and flavor changes at the end of the isothermal treatments (data not shown).\n\nIn terms of SiO2-E. faecium, a linear trend was observed similar to the typical inactivation kinetics reported in wheat flour (\n\nLiu et al., 2017\n\nLiu S.\n\nOzturk S.\n\nXu J.\n\nKong F.\n\nGray P.\n\nZhu M.-j.\n\nSablani S.S.\n\nTang J.\n\nMicrobial validation of radio frequency pasteurization of wheat flour by inoculated pack studies.\n\n), almond kernels (\n\nJeong et al., 2011\n\nJeong S.\n\nMarks B.P.\n\nRyser E.T.\n\nQuantifying the performance of Pediococcus sp.(NRRL B-2354: Enterococcus faecium) as a nonpathogenic surrogate for Salmonella Enteritidis PT30 during moist-air convection heating of almonds.\n\n), and balanced carbohydrate-protein meals (\n\nBianchini et al., 2014\n\nBianchini A.\n\nStratton J.\n\nWeier S.\n\nHartter T.\n\nPlattner B.\n\nRokey G.\n\nHertzel G.\n\nGompa L.\n\nMartinez B.\n\nEskridge K.M.\n\nUse of Enterococcus faecium as a surrogate for Salmonella enterica during extrusion of a balanced carbohydrate-protein meal.\n\n). Although the δ-values of NFMP-E. faecium were consistently higher than those of SiO2-E. faecium, it is not appropriate to conclude that E. faecium was more heat resistant than the other because of different α values. In Figure 4, the predictive lines of SiO2- and NFMP-E. faecium at 85, 90, and 95°C crossed when survivor populations dropped to 4 to 4.2 log cfu/g (see auxiliary arrows in Figure 4). This phenomenon resulted in complexity in modeling and interpretation of thermal inactivation kinetics of microorganisms.\n\nThe z values of SiO2-Salmonella, SiO2-E. faecium, and NFMP-Salmonella in NFMP at aw = 0.25 ± 0.02 varied from 16.0 to 16.5°C. These data match previously reported z values of Salmonella Enteritidis (16.9°C) and E. faecium (16.2°C) in wheat flour at aw = 0.30 ± 0.02 (\n\nLiu et al., 2018\n\nLiu S.\n\nRojas R.V.\n\nGray P.\n\nZhu M.-J.\n\nTang J.\n\nEnterococcus faecium as a Salmonella surrogate in the thermal processing of wheat flour: Influence of water activity at high temperatures.\n\n) and those of Salmonella Enteritidis in wheat flour (16.7 ± 0.73°C) modeled from D-values at 75 to 85°C at aw = 0.31–0.70 (\n\nSmith et al., 2016\n\nSmith D.F.\n\nHildebrandt I.M.\n\nCasulli K.E.\n\nDolan K.D.\n\nMarks B.P.\n\nModeling the effect of temperature and water activity on the thermal resistance of Salmonella Enteritidis PT 30 in wheat flour.\n\n). From reported data, z values of both strain sets might be independent of inert carriers (NFMP or SiO2) and food matrices.\n\nAppropriate preparation procedures of inoculated LMF should mimic the worst-case scenario of contamination in realistic applications and aid in the development of LMF thermal processing. Information has been provided to inoculate specific LMF (\n\nGrocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), 2009\n\nGrocery Manufacturers Association (GMA)\n\nControl of Salmonella in low-moisture foods.\n\n;\n\nAlmond Board of California (ABC), 2014\n\nAlmond Board of California (ABC)\n\nGuidelines for using Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 as a surrogate microorganism in almond process validation.\n\n), but is not applicable to all LMF. In our study, a dry inoculation method using SiO2 as the inert carrier alleviated the need for complicated food inoculation procedures (such as equilibration and pulverization) and facilitated evenly distributed bacterial cells in NFMP. In addition, SiO2 granules provided a constant low-moisture environment after inoculation, and showed potential for introducing microorganisms into various LMF, especially LMF that could not be restored back to original form after wetting. The NFMP itself served as a carrier as well, though it required an extra pulverization step. From our study, 2 observations of NFMP as a dry carrier were (1) NFMP-Salmonella were less thermally resistant than SiO2-Salmonella and (2) NFMP-E. faecium demonstrated an accelerated inactivation rate, which is not fully understood yet."
