        "text": "TORONTO — Lifeist Wellness Inc., a pharmaceutical products manufacturer, announces that its U.S. biosciences subsidiary Mikra Cellular Sciences Inc. has completed the product design and updated the expected shipment date of FOCUS. Mikra’s new product combines a blend of citicoline, tyrosine and lion’s mane mushroom to reportedly deliver health benefits and supplements.\n\n“I appreciate Team Mikra’s attention to detail in realizing our vision for the FOCUS design,” said Jose Bautista, a spokesperson for the product and an ex-MLB player. “Now that the product design stage is complete, we should be able to unveil the finished product ahead of schedule. I can’t wait for everyone to be able to try FOCUS for themselves.”\n\n“FOCUS will continue to deliver on our commitment to introducing science-backed natural solutions to everyday challenges,” added Meni Morim, CEO of Lifeist. “It has been an absolute pleasure joining forces with Jose to develop FOCUS, leveraging his experience both as an accomplished entrepreneur and as an elite athlete with extensive firsthand knowledge of cutting-edge nutraceutical supplementation. We’re confident that our customers will appreciate the lasting effectiveness of FOCUS, without the jitters and crashes that other products – which contain stimulants like caffeine – are infamous for. We have now completed the product design and look forward to fulfilling customer orders slightly ahead of schedule at the end of September in the third quarter of this year.”\n\nFOCUS says they combine the clinically studied citicoline with tyrosine and pure lion’s mane mushroom.\n\nLifeist Wellness says that a systematic review of the medical use of citicoline published in the Swiss journal Nutrients found:\n\n“…In research based on animals and humans, it was proved that citicoline is beneficial in the regeneration of neurons, can increase levels of neurotransmitters, and has a positive impact on cognitive functions.”\n\nThe company also said that a Mt. Sinai Hospital clinical abstract on the medical use of tyrosine reported:\n\n“…Researchers believe that, under stress, the body isn’t able to make enough tyrosine from phenylalanine. Some animal and human studies suggest that tyrosine supplements may help improve memory and performance under psychological stress… One study suggests that taking tyrosine may help you be more alert after sleep deprivation.”"
