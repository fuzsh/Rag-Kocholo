        "text": "2.1. Carbon‐based supports\n\nOne of the most widely used materials for the dispersion of electrocatalysts is carbon. Its high electrical conductivity and large surface area make it a suitable support for many electrocatalysts, notably for Pt in the case of oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. [102] However, it is not expected to be thermodynamically stable under oxygen evolution conditions and thus the stability of the catalyst should be carefully considered when using carbon‐based support.[ 93 , 103 ]\n\nOne of the first examples, where carbon was used as a support for Ir catalyst in acidic media was presented by Kong et al.[ 104 , 105 ] After a study of Pt/Ir on carbon to be used in an unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC), [104] Kong and his co‐worker focused on pure OER catalysts. Thereby, they synthesized ultrafine IrO2 nanoparticles (around 1.7 nm) on a reduced‐graphene oxide (RGO) support as seen in Figures a and 3b. [105] The mass activity of the supported catalyst was 2.3 times higher than the activity of commercial benchmark IrO2, which was attributed to the enhanced surface area as well as the better electrical conductivity provided by the graphene support. In addition, the IrO2/RGO catalyst displayed unexpectedly high stability after 5000 cycles under OER conditions (26.4 % loss vs 38.4 % for the IrO2 benchmark). The authors attributed this long‐term stability to the interaction between the π‐electrons of RGO and IrO2 which prevents the agglomeration of nanoparticles due to strong anchoring. However, the stability of the support itself, which would be expected to oxidize under these conditions, was not assessed. Similarly, IrO2 nanoparticles supported on multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT‐IrO2) were found to outperform the activity and stability of IrO2 benchmark and IrO2 on graphene from Kong et al. [106] The 40‐times better activity and longer durability compared to the benchmark were ascribed to the higher surface area of the supported catalyst as well as its interaction with the less electronegative support. This interaction evidenced by the shift of the Ir4 f peak in X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), modified the interaction with OER intermediates and enhanced the electron transport during OER. The high durability of the catalyst (80 % activity retained, Figures c and 3d) was ascribed to the mitigation of agglomeration of supported IrO2 nanoparticles, oppositely to the unsupported IrO2 benchmark.\n\nLater, Ir nanoparticles deposited on carbon‐based support have mostly been investigated as bifunctional catalysts.[ 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 ] Zhang et al. obtained impressive HER and OER catalysts by depositing low content of Ir (5.91 wt%) on 3D‐graphite foam support (Ir/GF) (Figure e). [109] The interaction of iridium with the graphite foam support improved not only the OER activity but also the HER activity (Figure f), surpassing the Pt/C, the benchmark for the latter reaction. A cell voltage of 1.55 VRHE was obtained for a 10 mA/cm2 current in a two‐electrode electrolyzer. In addition, the catalysts could maintain a quasi‐similar activity after 10 hours of electrolysis at 10 mA/cm2. However, this experiment was not performed in a real device where the harsher conditions, notably higher temperature, could be more damaging to the carbon. Iridium nanoparticles deposited on vertically grown graphene (Ir/VG) by Roy et al. also show increased performances for OER and HER. [111] The HER activity was similar to Pt/C in an acidic environment while the OER‐benchmark IrO2 was outperformed by 30 mV (overpotential of 300 mV vs 330 mV to reach a constant current of 10 mA/cm2). The stability of the catalyst was investigated and compared to Ir deposited on plane graphene (Ir/GC). The Ir/VG sample maintained the same activity after 1000 cycles while Ir/GC showed significant degradation. The enhanced stability was assigned to the strong interaction between VG and Ir which prevents the dissolution of metallic iridium. Once again, the stability closer to real‐device conditions, where carbon corrosion is enhanced, was not performed.\n\nGraphitic carbon appears to present a better resistance towards oxidation than more amorphous forms.[ 112 , 113 , 114 ] In addition, morphological or chemical modification of the graphitic carbon could further improve its stability. [115] Therefore, several modified‐carbon supports have been used to deposit Ir nanoparticles.[ 106 , 110 , 111 , 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 , 120 ] For example, Joshi et al. presented iridium nanoparticles sitting on boron‐doped reduced‐graphene support (IrO2−B−rGO) with enhanced stability and activity. [118] Their catalyst with around 2.3 wt% boron was compared with Ir nanoparticles (19.6 wt%) of the same size deposited on undoped‐reduced graphene oxide (IrO2−rGO). IrO2−B−rGO presented an 8‐times higher current density at 1.65 VRHE vs the undoped catalyst (Figure a), a better Tafel slope (124.8 mV/dec vs 176.5 mV/dec) as well as a lower onset potential (1.44 VRHE vs 1.54 VRHE). The improved activity was attributed to the presence of the boron in the support. The doping has two effects on the graphene support: the opening of the bandgap of the graphene lattice and a strong metal‐substrate interaction between IrO2 and B−rGO sheets as proven by theoretical calculations [121] and XPS experiments (Figure b). These modified interactions between Ir nanoparticles and the support led to improved activity. In addition, better stability was observed for IrO2−B−rGO after cycling between 1.2 and 1.6 VRHE. Indeed, even after 1200 cycles, the activity had only slightly decreased while 1000 cycles were enough to lose all OER activity for IrO2−rGO. The authors observed a similar trend during the chronoamperometry degradation test. They attributed the higher durability of the catalyst to the synergy between the IrO2 nanoparticles and the boron‐doped reduced graphene support, which prevents the loss of the precious metal particles′ surface area as supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images after accelerated degradation test (ADT) (Figures c and 4d). This synergy also helps to mitigate the oxidation of the support to CO2. The explanation for the carbon stability under harsh oxidizing conditions is that in absence of water, the carbon corrosion cannot happen.[ 122 , 123 ] Therefore, if all the water is split faster than the oxidation of carbon, the support can sustain highly oxidizing conditions. This concept is already in use to increase the stability of carbon in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Therefore, highly active IrO2 sites on carbon‐based support would promote water oxidation over carbon corrosion reaction and thus increase support durability. In absence of doping (IrO2−rGO) and with lower activity, the protection of the support was not occurring, and big performance losses were observed.\n\nOn the other hand, Wu et al. have synthesized small Ir nanoparticles (1.8–2.2 nm) on a nitrogen‐doped graphene support. [117] The catalyst with the support annealed at 750 °C, namely Ir@N−G‐750, presented the best electrochemical performances and was compared with an undoped catalyst, Ir@G‐750. Alike the work of Joshi et al. and their boron‐doped support, [118] the electrocatalyst with doped support presented better performances than its undoped counterpart. Specifically, an overpotential of 303 mV was necessary to achieve a constant current of 10 mA/cm2 during OER while 318 mV and 369 mV were needed for Ir/C and Ir@G‐750, respectively. In terms of stability, the same trend as for other doped/undoped catalysts appeared. In this case, Ir@N−G‐750 sustained 20 h at 20 mA/cm2 or 2000 cycles while in Ir@G‐750 and Ir/C benchmark significant deterioration occurred. The morphological and chemical stability of the catalyst was confirmed by XPS and TEM. XPS pointed out the interaction between iridium particles and the nitrogen present in the support, mostly on pyridinic sites (Figures e and 4 f). To understand the reason for these improved performances, the authors used density functional theory (DFT) in addition to characterization methods (XRD, XPS and TEM). The interactions between the two elements in the pyridinic sites of the support helped boosting iridium stability as well as activity. The DFT calculations further confirmed that Ir16 clusters were stabilized by coordinating N‐dopant.\n\nAt the same time, Chen et al obtained one of the best mass‐activity recorded for an Ir‐based catalyst in acidic media. [120] Their IrO2 nanoparticles on graphitic carbon nitride (IrO2/GCN) catalyst reached an impressive mass‐activity of 1280 A/gIr at 1.6 VRHE. According to the authors, the interactions and chemical bonding between the N‐rich environment and the precious metal nanoparticles modulated the atomic coordination and electronic structure of Ir active sites, promoting OER. XPS measurements showed a 0.2 eV negative shift of Ir4 f photoelectron line in the supported catalyst compared to IrO2 while EXAFS experiments exposed a compressed Ir−Ir bond in IrO2/GCN compared to the benchmark. A wavelet transformation of the EXAFS spectrum also confirmed the presence of more abundant low‐coordinated Ir sites in the supported nanoparticles. All of these resulted in a modified interaction between Ir and the O‐intermediate of OER in IrO2/GCN, promoting a good activity. In addition, GCN nanosheets are superhydrophilic which promoted the adsorption of the electrolyte and desorption of gas during the reaction, according to the authors (Figure g). Finally, IrO2/GCN presented better stability than the IrO2 benchmark under ADT due to the strong bonding between IrO2 and the support, inhibiting agglomeration and corrosion of the nanoparticles (Figure h). In addition, the IrO2/GCN with 40 wt% Ir was placed in a laboratory water splitting device (Pt/C was placed on the cathode) and could sustain for 24 hours at 1.6 V with current retention of 78.5 %.\n\nTherefore, doped‐graphitic carbon support seems to be able to sustain the harsh OER conditions in acidic media, overcoming the biggest carbon problem at this potential, i. e. carbon oxidation. The possibility of using carbon support for iridium, which seems to hinder the CO2 formation, could drastically decrease the amount of iridium in a real PEMWE. However, the stability of carbon should still be studied under real conditions in PEMWE, i. e. high current densities, high temperatures, and start‐up/shut‐down cycles, to ensure the long‐term durability of such catalysts.\n\n2.3. Other supports\n\nMetal oxides are arguably the most studied class of materials as potential supports for OER in acidic media as they usually present good stability under corrosive environments. Nevertheless, some other materials, i. e. carbides and nitrides, are promising and will be discussed in the following sections.\n\n2.3.1. Metal Nitrides\n\nMetal nitrides usually possess enhanced electrical and electrocatalytic properties compared to their metal oxide counterparts. [202] They can also easily form core‐shell structures during synthesis.[ 203 , 204 ] One previously mentioned metal nitride as potential support in acidic media is based on titanium, i. e. TiN. It possesses high conductivity and sufficient resistance to oxidation;[ 205 , 206 , 207 ] therefore Li et al. investigated the electrochemical performances of IrO2@Ir nanoparticles on TiN support (IrO2@Ir/TiN (60 wt%)). [208] The authors recorded a mass activity of 480.4 mA/mgIr at 1.6 VRHE for their supported catalyst, being 2.74 and 3.32 times the activity of the IrO2@Ir (homemade) and Ir black unsupported counterpart, respectively (Figure a). The better activity was ascribed to the negative shift of the electronic binding energy of Ir species in the Ir4 f XPS spectra. This shift is caused by the electron transfer from TiN to Ir. In terms of stability, IrO2@Ir/TiN lost 38.1 % of activity after 6 hours at 10 mA/cm2 compared to 69.7 % and 73.0 % for IrO2@Ir (homemade) and Ir black, respectively. The better durability of the catalyst was studied based on two common degradation processes, the oxidative dissolution, and the agglomeration of Ir species. The dissolution was studied by ICP‐OES and a clearly lower Ir dissolution was visible for the TiN‐containing sample, attributed to the electron transfer from TiN to Ir which inhibits the formation of (IrO4)− ions (Figure b). The aggregation of particles was analyzed with TEM images and, even if aggregation happened in all samples, the lowest increase was recorded for the supported catalyst. Thus, according to the authors, the TiN support effectively increased the activity thanks to the electron‐transfer from the support to the precious metal. This transfer also helped to boost the stability by inhibiting the oxidative dissolution in addition to the anti‐aggregation impact due to anchored nanoparticles on the support.\n\nYears later, Zhang et al. recorded an improved mass activity of 874 A/gIr at 1.6 VRHE for IrO2/TiN (31 wt% Ir). TiN support possesses a mesoporous, high‐surface‐area structure allowing a nice dispersion of small IrO2 nanoparticles (1.41±0.19 nm). [209] The good atoms efficiency of such small particles partially explained the 5‐times higher activity than that of IrO2 benchmark. In addition, the authors compared the scattering of IrO2 nanoparticles on the support with strawberry‐like seeds (Figure c). Consequently, a higher number of unsaturated iridium atoms were exposed and available as active sites, which helped to improve the activity. However, the stability of the catalyst was found to be worse than IrO2 by chronopotentiometry and chronoamperometry measurements, oppositely to Li's work (Figure d). [208] The difference could be explained by the different IrO2 chemical states. Indeed, in the previously discussed work, [208] a negative shift of the electronic binding energy was observed for iridium nanoparticles on TiN, meaning that iridium was in a lower oxidation state when supported on TiN. In Zhang's work, the opposite was reported with a higher ratio of Ir4+/Ir3+ found in IrO2/TiN than in IrO2 (1.9 : 1 vs 1.4 : 1) [209] (Figure e and 13 f). A difference in particles size and morphology could also explain the observed stability difference. Nonetheless, the chemical effect of TiN support seems to be different in both cases and further study should be conducted to reveal the impact of TiN on the oxidation state of IrO2 nanoparticles with the different particle size.\n\nAnother nitride support was based on silica, Si3N4, but only a slight enhancement of electrochemical performances was recorded. [210] It was most likely due to the low interaction between the support and IrO2 as well as the low conductivity of Si3N4 alone. Other nitride supports for Ir‐based catalysts were investigated in alkaline media and are thus out of the scope of this review.[ 211 , 212 ]\n\n2.3.2. Metal Carbides\n\nMany transition metal carbides fulfill the requirements of electrochemical support, i. e. high chemical and mechanical stability, good electrical conductivity, and sufficient surface area.[ 213 , 214 ] One of the first carbide materials investigated as possible support for OER in acidic media was, again, based on titanium.[ 215 , 216 , 217 , 218 ] The intrinsic stability of this metal makes it an interesting first choice to study. Thereby, Zhai et al. prepared Ir/TiC and inspected the suitability of TiC as an OER support. [215] The chemical and electrochemical stability of the substrate under OER conditions as well as the improved activity compared to Ir‐black makes TiC a favorable candidate to support Ir in PEMWE. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, only two studies, besides the two from Zhai's group,[ 215 , 216 ] were conducted with TiC supported iridium under acidic OER conditions.[ 217 , 218 ] Fuentes et al. used TiC as support for Pt−Ir nanoparticles to successfully synthetize a bifunctional catalyst for regenerative fuel cell with higher round‐trip efficiency than previously presented URFC bifunctional catalysts. [217] On the other hand, Karimi and Peppley studied TiC as a possible OER catalyst support along with other carbide materials. [218] They based their work on previously proposed carbide‐based substrates such as TiC, TaC, NbC, WC and other materials such as NbO2 and ATO. First, the potential supports were compared based on conductivity study and surface area measurements. The BET measurements were similar for WC, TaC, NbO2 and NbC with values between 0.8 and 1.7 m2/g while ATO and TiC presented BET of 34.4 and 28.3 m2/g, respectively. The highest BET of the two latest could be due to their significantly lower particles size (nm vs μm for the four other materials). The conductivity measurement showed a different trend with the conductivity of the two oxide‐based supports (ATO and NbO2) and TiC being 10 S/cm while the three other carbides possessed a conductivity around 25, 68 and 173 S/cm for WC, TaC and NbC, respectively (Figure a). However, after deposition of 20 wt% Ir, all the samples presented similar conductivity, ranging from 0.3 S/cm (NbO2) to 10 S/cm (TaC). The decrease in conductivity of the carbides (NbC, TaC, WC) might be due to their oxidation during the ethylene glycol‐based synthesis. Therefore, the authors emphasized that, in their opinion, a good surface area is a more important parameter than the intrinsic conductivity of the support. Afterwards, the activity of the Ir‐supported catalysts was compared and Ir/ATO, Ir/NbO2 and Ir/TaC were found to be the best performing catalysts (Figure b). The poor performances of other carbides were not assessed by the authors except for Ir/TiC. The authors explained the lowest activity of Ir/TiC by the lowest OER activity of TiC alone compared to other support materials without Ir. In addition, the authors claimed that TiC could negatively affect the Ir activity, oppositely to Zhai's work.[ 215 , 216 ] Henceforth, the materials’ intrinsic OER activity could be an important parameter for the selection of the support, according to the two authors. Finally, the importance of the support surface area was studied by ball‐milling TaC and NbO2 to increase their surface area before iridium deposition. A 50 % improvement in OER activity was recorded for Ir/TaC with a 6‐times higher BET of TaC (Figure c). Therefore, the authors proposed the following important order of support properties: Support OER Activity ∼ Support Surface Area≫Electrical Conductivity. It should be kept in mind that no comparison to benchmark was performed during the study and the OER performances were presented against Ag/AgCl, which complicated the comparison to literature. Nonetheless, among the studied carbides, TaC was the most promising. Ir/TaC was also shown to be a promising electrocatalyst in a PEMWE by Polansky et al.[ 219 , 220 ] After a first study assuring the suitability of TaC as an electrocatalyst support, [219] Polansky et al. synthesized IrO2 on TaC with 50, 70 and 90 wt%. [220] Such a high loading was necessary to ensure good conductivity as well as prevent the passivation of TaC into NaTaO3. [219] The performances of the three samples and IrO2 benchmark were then analyzed in a PEMWE between 1.4 and 1.8 V at various temperatures (90°, 110°, 120° and 130 °C). [220] The supported catalyst outperformed the IrO2 benchmark. Among the supported catalysts, IrO2 70 wt%/TaC was found to present the highest current densities (36 % improvement compared to IrO2 at 1.7 V and 130 °C, Figure d)), along with the lowest charge transfer and cell resistances. In addition, no degradation was observed during the experiments, making TaC possible support to be used in real devices.\n\nIn the case of high loading of iridium, the conductivity of the support is not so primordial as it will be provided by the active compound. However, to manage a significant reduction of the iridium loading, the intrinsic conductivity of the support becomes more important and not all metal carbides present a sufficiently low resistance. For example, SiC, promising support for high‐temperature PEM steam fuel cell[ 221 , 222 ] due to its high stability against phosphoric acid, possesses quite poor conductivity. Thus, Nikiforov et al. doped it with silicon, synthesizing SiC−Si (>22 % free Si) as support for iridium. [223] Various iridium loadings were studied, from 0 to 100 wt% by a 10 % increment. Unfortunately, the conductivity of the doped support was found insufficient without proper IrO2 loading, with a conductivity 1.8⋅10−5 S/cm for pure SiC−Si. Nonetheless, a slight reduction of Ir loading with improved performances was still observed but 60 wt% Ir was necessary to reach sufficient conductivity.\n\nFinally, a recent study on boron carbide was conducted by Islam et al. [224] They synthesized Ir on B4C support and varied the reduction temperature during the synthesis. Namely, four samples were prepared at 30°, 60°, 80° and 100 °C (named Ir/B4C−T°) and compared to Ir‐black and IrO2 benchmarks. The different temperatures resulted in different particle size distribution and crystallization. Indeed, TEM pictures showed that higher temperature led to smaller Ir nanoparticles with an average diameter of 22 nm, 3.2 nm, 1.98 nm, and 1.3 nm for Ir/B4C–30, Ir/B4C–60, Ir/B4C–80, Ir/B4C–100, respectively. Similarly, H2‐temperature programmed reduction measurements showed that amorphous IrO2 was present in Ir/B4C–80 and −100 but not in the two other samples (Figure e). This was confirmed by XPS with an increasing Ir(III)/Ir(IV) ratio with increasing synthesis temperature (Figure f). Consequently, Ir/B4C–80 and Ir/B4C–100 outperformed the other homemade catalysts and benchmarks during activity tests. In addition, Ir/B4C–80 and particularly Ir/B4 −100 were also observed to be the most stable catalysts after a 3 h chronopotentiometry ADT (Figure h). However, smaller nanoparticles and more amorphous iridium should exhibit faster dissolution and thus be less stable according to theory. [225] Thanks to XPS, the better durability could be explained by a strong metal‐support interaction. Indeed, a shift in the Ir4 f, as well as B1s spectra, was noticed and attributed to a charge transfer between the two materials. This shift was present in all supported samples compared to the benchmark and increased with increasing synthesis temperature, pointing out a stronger interaction at higher temperatures. This interaction was also most likely involved in better activity performances. Therefore, the support helped to stabilize the less stable but more active Ir(III), when the synthesis temperature was increased. In addition, it also prevented nanoparticles agglomeration in Ir/B4C–100 as seen in TEM picture after ADT. Last but not least, the best catalyst, Ir/B4C–100, was tested in MEA and found to outperform benchmark catalysts (Figure g). Thus, the authors not only presented theoretically possible support but showed its suitability in a real device."
