        "text": "Insider trading is the negotiation in stock market misusing privileged information by people who are in exclusive position to access to such information, should be informed the market as a \"relevant fact\", except in an ongoing operation, on which a legitimate interest to keep reserved is held. They are called corporate insiders. The determination of the legal system of the international financial operations with privileged information presents certain difficulties, due the absence of a common regulation, also in the European Union.\n\nAbstract: Objective – Our main objective is to analyze the impacto f insider trading on stock investments’ decision. Design/methodology/approach – We used an online survey, obtaining 271 valid answers. To analyze our data, we used some parametric (tand F Anova), and non-parametric techniques (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis). Findings – We find that insider tradings are relevant to investment decisions, and the timeliness also exert an influence to this kind of decision, especially abnormal trades. Practical implications – In practical terms, our results suggests that the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) must update the Brazilian insider trading regulation to achieve the objective to protect investors. In the investors point of view, this possible update could improve investors’ ability to control insiders and follow his activities as well as to mimic his trades. Originality/value – The originality of our paper is an analysis of relevance, timeliness and influence of position in a firm as “determinants” of investment decisions. We use these three specific characteristics to criticize the Brazilian insider trading regulation."
