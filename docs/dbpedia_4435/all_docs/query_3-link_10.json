My question applies to 'Seek Thermal' and 'Flir One' devices as well. I've sent an inquiry to Ulis thermal sensors distributor and the cheapest 80p resolution thermal sensor is for 300€, so the price of the sensor alone exceeds the whole price of Seek and F1. I saw some graphs presenting that CCD and CMOS camera sensors are able to detect the mid-infrared waves used in thermal imaging when you remove their filters and leave only bare sensor. Then it is only a matter of trimming the wave spectrum.\n\nI took one of my CCD cameras and removed all that was between lens and sensor surface. Then I took my 19mm germanium lens that I'm using with my thermal camera aaaand... nothing happened. I'm afraid that germanium just cuts too much spectrum. Right now I'm planning to do the same thing but with Umicore lens (which, by the way, are bloody difficult to acquire).

I will link it in my Flir link list (see my signature)\n\nedit 18.09.2015\n\n1. Convert your raw Therm-App image with the FLIR calibration reversed. This is done with imagemagick's convert command. The command is: convert input.png -resize 200% -flop -fx \"(((17711.559/((EXP(1447.2/(((u*65536)/100)+273.15)))-0.57999998)/0.025931966)+4096))/65536\" out.png\n\nThis is assuming your temperature is stored as degrees C x100. I will update this once a more completed app is avaliable that outputs raw data.\n\nNote this also flips the image horizontally (because the raw images are horizontally flipped) and upscales 200% (because FLIR Tools can't upscale for saving).\n\n2. Insert this raw image into the FLIR image I linked above. This is done with a php script called \"splitjpg.php\" created by tomas123. It was originally intended for use with stitching FLIR camera panoramas in external software. You can download it here: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/flir-e4-thermal-imaging-camera-teardown/?action=dlattach;attach=76829\n\nPlease note you will need php installed for this. Now run \"php splitjpg.php -i flir1.jpg -r out.png -o flirout\", where flir1.jpg is any of the files that I've posted here, out.png is the image outputted by imagemagick, and flirout (.jpg will be added automatically) is the resulting file that can be opened with FLIR Tools. Please note the preview image on the file will be incorrect - this will be corrected once we open it in FLIR Tools.\n\n3. Open the file with FLIR Tools. Press \"auto\" for scaling, as right now it's reading some predefined data from the file for the range which is wrong. Then, press save. The jpg will now carry the correct preview image and you can now begin using FLIR Tools to add measurements or create a report.\n\nsome background informations:\n\nthe necessary paramaters for -fx formula you get from the reference image\n\nCode: [Select]\n\n>exiftool -Planck* -Object* -Emis* -Reflected* flir1.jpg\n\nPlanck R1 : 17711.559\n\nPlanck B : 1447.2\n\nPlanck F : 0.57999998\n\nPlanck O : -4096\n\nPlanck R2 : 0.025931966\n\nObject Distance : 0.00 m\n\nEmissivity : 1.00\n\nReflected Apparent Temperature : 20.0 C\n\nthe -fx formula is the rearranged equation to calculate the temperature from Flir-RAW value and \"Planck Values\".\n\nRAW=f(Temperature_Object, Reflected_Apparent_Temperature, Planck_Values)\n\nsee my excel sheet for understanding\n\n- https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/flir-ex-realtime-raw-radiometric-data-streaming-via-uvc/msg744673/#msg744673\n\n- https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/flir-e4-thermal-imaging-camera-teardown/msg342072/#msg342072\n\n« Last Edit: September 18, 2015, 05:00:39 pm by tomas123 »\n\namyk\n\nSuper Contributor\n\nPosts: 8345\n\nRe: Opgal Therm-App - first smartphone thermal imager to ship\n\n« Reply #37 on: September 17, 2015, 01:42:00 pm »\n\n384x288 at 25Hz... interestingly, no mention of that model being export-restricted besides a vague disclaimer in their license agreement.

No processing or noise reduction.\n\nI investigated the stripes and this is what it seems like is happening: When the camera is first turned on, the stripes appear for objects over ~50 degrees. However once I leave the camera on for around 5-10 minutes (I assume for the sensor to warm up), the strips disappear. After that they only appear for very hot objects (over 120 degrees or so)\n\nEDIT: I will do a noise test and update you.\n\n« Last Edit: September 25, 2015, 10:27:41 am by encryptededdy »\n\nencryptededdy\n\nFrequent Contributor\n\nPosts: 360\n\nCountry:\n\nRe: Opgal Therm-App - first smartphone thermal imager to ship\n\n« Reply #49 on: September 25, 2015, 10:30:17 am »\n\nHere's a picture of a pot.\n\nAs you can see, the stripes only appear for high temperature objects now."
