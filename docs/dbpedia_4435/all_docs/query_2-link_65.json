        "text": "Hyundai Motor America is recalling nearly 50,000 of some of its newer models due to \"unintentional airbag deactivation or deployment,\" federal officials said.\n\nCertain 2024 Santa Fe and Santa Fe HEV models were recalled on Wednesday with the potential number of affected vehicles being 49,719, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\n\"The main floor wiring harness may chafe against the passenger-side second-row bench seat assembly and become damaged, which can cause the airbags to deploy unintentionally or prevent the airbags from deploying in a crash,\" the NHTSA said.\n\nIf an airbag deploys unintentionally, it can increase the risk of injury, according to the federal agency. An airbag that does not deploy as expected or intended can increase the risk of injury in a crash.\n\nWhat can affected Hyundai Santa Fe owners do?\n\nTo remedy the issue, dealers will inspect and repair, or replace the wiring harness as needed, free of charge, the NHTSA said.\n\nOwner notification letters should be mailed out on Sept. 23. Affected owners can contact Hyundai customer service at 1-855-371-9460. Hyundai's number for this recall is 265.\n\nAffected owners can also contact the NHTSA Vehicle Safety Hotline or go to SaferCar's website.\n\nHyundai Genesis Coupe models recalled\n\nHyundai also issued a separate recall of over 12,000 U.S. vehicles due to \"unintended vehicle movement\" that could increase the risk of a crash, the NHTSA said.\n\n\"A return spring in the ignition lock switch, in certain 2010-2013 Genesis Coupe vehicles, may fracture, which can result in unintended vehicle movement when the vehicle is started in gear, without the parking brake applied,\" the agency said.\n\nTo fix the potential 12,612 affected vehicles, dealers will replace the ignition lock switch, free of charge, according to the NHTSA."
