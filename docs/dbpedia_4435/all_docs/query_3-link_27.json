        "text": "Dear all,\n\nas this is my first post I want to thank you for this great forum and your efforts sharing this overwhelming informations. My apologies for my english. It is not my native language. I'm located in Germany.\n\nI signed in months ago, try to read and learn as time allows. I started with first little experiments and I'm afraid I have to come back with questions at given points.\n\nNevertheless I want to share my data as a marginal contribution to this forum. I noticed there are very different data on PM content of IC's in plastic packages.\n\nLast year I got back results a batch of BGA Chips I gave to a professional refiner. Please see picture and the result. Batch was pure not mixed with other IC's.\n\nChips are squarish with 6x6 mm edge length. 1 chip has a weight of 0.06 g.\n\nOn the picture you can see that every chip has 64 so called solder balls.\n\nAlthough data of refiner are in german I think they are easy to understand.\n\nOriginal batch weight was 24 kg. After inciniration 18.1 kg material left.\n\nContents of material left: Gold 1.146 %, Silver 0.715 %.\n\nAssaying and refinig cost were 399 EUR. Refiner pays me 98% of gold and 72 % of silver.\n\nI have similar data with a second batch. So data given are obtained from 100 kg of refined IC's.\n\nThis kind of IC's are to be find in e.g. cell phones. Doing the power management, audio and camera funcions. Picture shows IC's build in Motorola ZN5.\n\nSummarized data on BGA Chips with 64 solder balls in a 6x6mm package:\n\nOrganic content: 25%\n\nAu content: 0.865 %\n\nAg content: 0.539 %\n\nRefining costs: 20 Euro/kg\n\nPerhaps there is someone who can use this data for estimation of PM contents of similar chips.\n\nThank you for this great forum.\n\nAttachments\n\nNew Picture_.jpg\n\nHello Simon,\n\nyou're welcome.\n\nMeanwhile in Germany it is more difficult for private persons. That's the reason why my current batch of 100 kg stucks because my refiner does not accept material from private persons any more.\n\nIt's a pitty as he also accepted small batches. There are also brokers, but I don't sell them anything. Best offer I got from them were 10 % of the gold value.\n\nIf you are a company and not located in Germany it is much more easier to find a refiner. You can google for e.g. AMI Doduco or RECOM.\n\nConditions should be similar. But you need at least 100 kg and a tax ID number.\n\nFurthermore I don't know whether they are doing the whole jobs themselves. It seems to be that they forward the batches to a smelter after some pretreatment and analysis.\n\nIf you are a bigger player one smelter in Germany is Norddeutsche Affinerie or you can contact e.g. UMICORE in Belgium directly.\n\nBR - Börki"
