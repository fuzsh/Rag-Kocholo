EDITORS COMMENTS

In the heart of Antwerp, Belgium, stands a architectural marvel, a testament to the creative vision of Gerard Valckx, a renowned architect of the 20th century. This photograph, captured by an unnamed artist and showcased on 1x Gallery, invites us to explore the intricate beauty of Umicore, Valckx's magnum opus. The image, bathed in the soft, ethereal glow of monochrome tones, reveals a building that defies the ordinary. Its sleek, curved lines and smooth, polished surfaces are a harmonious blend of organic and geometric shapes. The windows, like the eyes of this living entity, reflect the world around them, adding an extra layer of depth and dimension. The use of light in this photograph is nothing short of inspired. The light circle, a perfect ring of illumination, casts a halo around the building, drawing our gaze inward. The reflection in the mirror-like windows adds a sense of infinity, as if the building goes on forever. The double image created by the reflection in the windows further emphasizes the symmetry and balance that define this architectural masterpiece. The curves and shapes are repeated, creating a sense of unity and cohesion. The contrast between the dark, textured surface of the building and the bright, reflective windows adds depth and texture to the image. This photograph is a creative edit of reality, a visual poem that invites us to look beyond the surface and appreciate the beauty and complexity of Umicore. It is a reminder that architecture is not just a functional necessity, but an art form that can inspire and captivate us. This image, with its intricate shapes, curves, and reflections, is a testament to the power of architectural design and the artist's ability to capture its essence in a single frame.
