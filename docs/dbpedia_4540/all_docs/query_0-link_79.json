        "text": "Tom Jones\n\nIt’s not unusual to be successful if you are Sir Tom Jones. I first heard his name growing up from my Greek mother. Even though she barely spoke any English, she knew Tom Jones and his songs. She communicated to me that he was a man’s man, with a real voice when I was 11 years old.\n\nI salute you Sir Tom Jones!\n\nSir Thomas Jones Woodward, known to all of us as Tom Jones, is a Welsh singer. His career began with a string of top-ten hits in the mid-1960s. He was born June 7, 1940, and, at 81 years old he still going strong today.\n\nGo Tom!\n\nJones was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music in 2005.\n\nSome of his hits include, deep breath:\n\nIt’s Not Unusual\n\nDelilah\n\nGreen Green Grass of Home\n\nI’ll Never Fall in Love\n\nI Who Have Nothing\n\nShe’s a Lady\n\nSexbomb\n\nKiss\n\nWhat’s New Pussycat\n\nThunderball\n\nLove me Tonight\n\nI’m Coming Home\n\nHis top streaming song? It’s Not Unusual (1965)\n\nNumber of Streams: 18.3 million\n\nIt’s hard to imagine anyone else being able to pull this song off. Tom originally recorded it as a demo for Sandie Shaw, who suggested he launch it himself. It was the first of three Number 1 hits for Tom, topping the Official Charts UK list despite the BBC initially refusing to play it because of his sexy persona.\n\nNumber 2 is Delilah, released in 1968, with 12 million streams. Let’s apply some of his successful actions to our businesses:\n\nCome up with great products and services.\n\nStay in the public eye with PR and Marketing: Tom for example became a judge on The Voice UK in 2012 and gave an impromptu performance with Peter Donegan (The Voice Stage #58).\n\nPromote your great products and services with Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Ads, Social Media, create an app for your business, etc.\n\nPersist! Tom is over 80 and hasn’t stopped. Promotion means continually promoting your business so CONTINUALLY PROMOTE YOUR BUSINESS.\n\nOne other thing I have noticed while writing articles covering celebrities is that they become known in one area first and then branch out due to demand. Start with one product or service, make it a smashing success and then branch out while continuing to promote the first one.\n\nMany companies have asked me to make them known in a major city with a small Google Ads click budget. I always say to first take over a 10 km radius or become strong in your own backyard. Get some sales going and then we can start exponentially expanding when there is more budget to do so. Successful bands and celebrity’s seem to have this down pat. So, we can learn from them and apply it to our businesses.\n\nWhat Tom has done Is Not Unusual and you can do it for your business too.\n\nGive me a call for a free consultation on how to achieve your business goals this year!"
