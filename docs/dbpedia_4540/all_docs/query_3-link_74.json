        "text": "Thomas Michael ‘Tommy’ Shelby OBE DCM MM MP is the main protagonist of the Peaky Blinders. He is the son of Arthur and Mrs. Shelby, brother of Arthur, John, Ada and Finn Shelby, father of Duke, Charles and Ruby Shelby, as well as being the husband of Grace and Lizzie Shelby. He is the leader of the Birmingham criminal gang, the Peaky Blinders and the patriarch of the Shelby Family.\n\nThomas served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and received medals for gallantry (which he threw away in a canal after returning from the war). His experiences in World War I left him disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes determined to move his family up in the world so that the powers who had always mistreated them could no longer touch them.\n\nAfter the vendetta with the New York Mafia, and during the year of the Wall Street Crash, Thomas Shelby became a Member of Parliament as a member of the Labour Party, while lending the chair of the legal business to his older brother, Arthur Shelby.\n\nCharacter History\n\n\"The one minute. The soldier’s minute. In a battle, that’s all you get. One minute of everything at once, and anything before is nothing. Everything after, nothing. Nothing in comparison to that one minute.\"\n\nThomas Shelby\n\n1890-1919\n\nThomas Michael Shelby was born in 1890, to Arthur and Mrs. Shelby. He was born on a boat, in a barge called ‘The January’ and had an elder brother, Arthur Shelby, who he was extremely close with as a child. Over the years, Thomas’ parents welcomed three more children, John, Ada and Finn Shelby.\n\nThomas’ parents were both Gypsies of Irish descent, making him and all of his siblings full-blooded Gypsies as well. It is implied by Thomas’ paternal aunt, Polly Gray, that the Lee Family are the Shelby Family’s kin, through their mother. They also have Irish Traveller ancestry, this is because Polly mentioned that alongside Romani, they should not speak Shelta around Karl Thorne, which is the language spoken by Irish Travellers. It is also heavily implied that their father was a partial Irish Traveller.\n\nWhile growing up in Small Heath, Birmingham, Thomas carried a razorblade and a screwdriver on him and would tell the other children in the area that he could lay curses, so they were afraid of him and didn't pick on or tease him because of it. Thomas and his siblings would have to get their fathers beer from The Garrison. However, because they were so little, it would take two of them to carry one bucket back to their house. Thomas would also fight with his brothers over cigarettes and one time, when Thomas was 9 and Arthur was 12, they got into a massive physical argument. Thomas pinned Arthur against the ground and began hitting him several times over the head, later winning the fight, although Thomas acknowledged that Arthur let him win. Their mother had a close friend, Charlie Strong, who was around a lot during their upbringing, which resulted in them looking up to him as their ‘uncle’.\n\nIn 1909, when the youngest Shelby sibling was still an infant, their mother became severely depressed and contemplated suicide. Their father was no help, so Charlie intervened and convinced her to go on the road, so she left Birmingham and travelled to Worcester. When she returned from her trip, she bought back a white pony and gifted it to Thomas. She watched Thomas ride the pony around for a few weeks, seemingly in a much better mindset than she was before her trip. Charlie believed she was better, however he was wrong. Shortly after her return, Mrs. Shelby jumped into the canal and committed suicide, like her own father before her. Charlie had the job of removing Mrs. Shelby’s body from the canal, which broke his heart, as he was secretly in love with her.\n\nShortly after Mrs. Shelby’s death, Thomas’ father began finding it hard to cope, raising five children on his own. He eventually abandoned them all in the care of his sister, and left Birmingham. Polly was left alone to raise her niece and nephews, and became the head of the house, as well as their mother figure. This resulted in the Shelby siblings gaining immense respect for Polly as they got older since they were extremely grateful for all she had done for them.\n\nSometime before 1914, Thomas fell deeply in love with an Italian girl, Greta Jurossi. Her parents didn’t approve of a Gypsy boy dating their daughter, but Thomas eventually won them over with his charm and sweetness. A few months later, Greta became extremely ill with consumption and although the disease was contagious, Thomas stayed by her bedside for three months, holding her hand. Greta eventually died from her illness, which broke Thomas’ heart.\n\nIn May 1914, Thomas met a Romani girl called Zelda, while at the Appleby Fair. Zelda stole Thomas’ watch and chain, but despite this, later that day they had sex underneath a hazel tree. Zelda became pregnant with Thomas’ child and when her father found out, he shot Thomas in the chest with a squirrel gun. Her father wanted to kill Thomas, but before he could do so, Thomas was sent away to fight in WWI, along with two of his brothers.\n\nIn early 1915, while Thomas was in France fighting in WWI, Zelda gave birth to their child, a son called Erasmus Shelby. Although Thomas returned from war in 1918, he never tried to contact Zelda and she raised their son alone. When Erasmus became older, he asked his mother who his father was and Zelda told him a false story. Zelda still had the watch she had stolen from Thomas, which had the words “Saxon Shore” carved on the back, so she told Erasmus that his father was the Duke of the Saxon Shore. As a result, Erasmus changed his name to ‘Duke’ and doesn’t like people using his birth name.\n\nIt is implied that Thomas had a drastic personality shift between before and after his experiences in the WWI, during which he was a Tunneller or Sapper (a volunteer covertly digging treacherous tunnels in order to place enormous amounts of explosives beneath enemy lines – a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect). After the War, he began experiencing symptoms of PTSD and would often experience frightening nightmares, flashbacks, and hallucinations, all of which he kept to himself.\n\nThomas is shown to be a member of the Small Heath Rifles at the rank of sergeant major – a non-commissioned officer in charge of well-being, morale and training of the entire unit (all other sergeants and corporals answer to him as well as to the actual commanding officers). His flawless conduct in this role (made even more difficult on account of his youth at the time) earned him unwavering respect both from members of his unit and other veterans alike and cemented his reputation in the streets.\n\nAs to his heritage, Thomas claims that he is related to the Lee family on his mother's side and Johnny Dogs claims that Thomas's grandfather was a \"king\", most likely a King of the Gypsies. He is the second of the Shelby siblings.\n\nWorld War One\n\nShelby is a former British soldier and his war record states that he fought bravely at the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of Somme. His actions at Mons reportedly saved thousands of allied lives, for which he received medals of honour after the War, including the Military Medal and the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\nSeries 1 · 1919\n\nShelby rides a big black horse into the Chinese quarters in Birmingham, where the horse is subjected to a \"powder trick\" in an attempt to rig a horse race. It is revealed that the horse is named \"Monaghan Boy\". He then returns to the Shelby residence for a family meeting. Upon learning that a new policeman is about to be stationed in Birmingham following the loss of a consignment of guns from the BSA factory, Polly Shelby takes Thomas aside and questions him on the matter. He reveals to her that his men accidentally acquired the wrong crate during a routine pick-up, instead taking a crate that contained Lewis machine guns, ammunition, semi-automatic rifles, and pistols with shells.\n\nSeemingly heeding Polly's advice, Thomas says he'll dump the guns as soon as the full moon wanes, in the hope that the policemen won't pursue the matter further. After Arthur Shelby Jr. is forcibly taken to meet Inspector Campbell, and reveals that Campbell might want to work together with them to recover the missing consignment, Thomas, after a moment's pause, leaves the room without any further discussion of the matter. Some time after, as Curly and Charlie Strong (Thomas's uncle) are preparing to drop the guns off, Thomas changes his mind about leaving the guns for the police to find, and has Curly drop the guns off at the old tobacco wharf, where the Peaky Blinders keep contraband cigarettes—all in favour of some alternative strategy.\n\nLater, it is revealed that the new barmaid at The Garrison Pub, Grace, is an undercover agent working to recover the missing guns, when she meets with Campbell. She then informs Campbell that the leader of the Peaky Blinders is not Arthur, but Thomas.\n\nNot long later, Shelby, Arthur and John Shelby are in the countryside for the fair — also at the fair is the gypsy Lee Family. An insult dealt to their mother by one of the Lee brothers results in a brawl, led by Thomas. On their return, Polly takes Shelby aside to tell him that Inspector Campbell wants to meet him. In return for the unwelcome police raid in Birmingham, Thomas instructs and orchestrates a mass burning of the pictures of the King, and gets a reporter to cover this incident, drawing the attention and displeasure of Winston Churchill to Inspector Campbell.\n\nLater, while collecting his horse from Curly, Charlie presents a bullet with Thomas's name engraved on it — a declaration of war from the Lee clan. While on the streets, he is stopped by Grace when she tosses a bucket of spit before his horse, and he invites her to the Cheltenham Races.\n\nOn his return to the Shelby home, Polly informs him of his sister Ada's pregnancy, and he storms off to find Ada at the cinema, demanding the identity of the father of her child.\n\nThe fixed race with the horse Monaghan Boy pays off, and the Peaky Blinders make a fortune. However, Thomas had fixed the race without the permission of Billy Kimber, the man who controls all the bookmaking sites at racecourses, and Polly chides him for it.\n\nAfterwards, Shelby reveals his plan to take over Billy Kimber's business when he meets Inspector Campbell and offers him a deal: in return for Inspector Campbell's (and the policemen's) non-interference with the work of the Peaky Blinders and the impending takeover of Billy Kimber's business, Thomas promises the removal of Freddie Thorne from the city as well as the missing guns to Campbell. Thomas ensures his own safety by telling Campbell that if he is taken into police custody, the guns will be dropped off at Liverpool, brought to Belfast and sold to the IRA. Campbell seemingly agrees to the deal, and Thomas leaves after making a snide remark at Campbell's deferment from the war.\n\nOne night, while in the throes of a nightmare, Curly wakes Thomas up and tells Thomas that the horse he bought from the fair is cursed, and the curse will soon spread to the heart of the horse. After Charlie deduces that this is the work of the Lee family, Thomas shoots his horse, then heads to the now-empty Garrison Pub for a drink, where he is served by Grace. He then reveals to her that, contrary to what she has said about her past, he knows she's never worked in any pub in Dublin, then goes on to (incorrectly) guess that she was a pregnant runaway, but promises Grace to keep it a secret.\n\nThe following day, Billy Kimber storms into The Garrison Pub, demanding to see \"any man named Shelby\". The Shelby brothers, and Thomas in particular, receive the wrath of Billy Kimber, who accuses Thomas of fixing the races, and subsequently threatens to shoot them. Thomas, however, politely offers to strike a deal with him; given that both Thomas and Billy Kimber are at war with the Lee family, Thomas proposes to work with Billy Kimber to beat the Lee family to both their advantages. Though Kimber doesn't accept their offer immediately, they come to a truce because of Thomas's overly respectful appearance.\n\nThe following day, Grace asks Thomas for two more shillings to pay for her dress; he tells her to buy something coloured red. Meanwhile, two IRA members meet with Thomas at The Garrison Pub, telling him they would pay good money for the stolen guns from the BSA factory, should the Peaky Blinders gang be or come into possession of them. Thomas confronts Freddie Thorne — who still hasn't left the city — telling him that his marriage to Ada will not last. Meanwhile Sergeant Moss threatens Thomas, telling him that Ada will be thrown in jail for sedition if Thomas does not deliver Freddie to the police. As a gesture to gaining his trust, Shelby also warns Billy Kimber that the Lee family is going to be at the Cheltenham races, and that they are planning on robbing Kimber’s bookies.\n\nThomas has another nightmare of the war, and the next day heads to Cheltenham with Grace. After taking back Kimber's money from the Lees, he makes a deal with Kimber, offering members of the Peaky Blinders to be used as security for Kimber. Kimber agrees, on the condition that he gets to spend a few hours with Grace. Initially Thomas agrees, but he heads to Kimber's mansion and interrupts them, lying to Kimber that Grace has the clap, thereby saving her.\n\nThomas leaves the Shelby home unattended (except for Scudboat) as John calls a family meeting. Upon re-arriving at the home, Thomas and his family find the place trashed, and they find wire cutters, indicating that somewhere a hand grenade is hidden. Thomas realizes the hand grenade is for him, and finds his brother Finn playing with his car. He saves Finn and throws the grenade, and tells Finn to never pretend to be him, as his life is in constant danger.\n\nThomas goes to the Lee family to settle the dispute between the Lees and the Shelbys once and for all, claiming that he is related to the Lee family on his mother’s side, Thomas tells them that he will be betraying Billy Kimber, and that he needs men to help. In exchange, he marries his brother John to a Lee family member named Esme to join their families.\n\nThomas delivers to Inspector Campbell the address of Stanley Chapman, a communist, instead of Freddie Thorne. Billy Kimber meanwhile hands Thomas the Shelby Company Limited’s first legal racetrack pitch.\n\nThomas brings Grace to the Catholic Church, knowing that she is a liar and confronts her about it. He also offers her a job and compliments her, telling her she has an air of class, and he kisses her. He gives Grace her first job, telling her to invite Ada to John’s wedding with Esme. After the wedding ceremony, Thomas allows Freddie to see his newborn son, but Grace reveals Freddie’s location to the police and Freddie is taken into custody.\n\nShortly after Freddie is arrested, Thomas tells Grace to mark a specific date on the business calendar — ‘Black Star Day’, the day in which he will take out Billy Kimber and his men at the races.\n\nAn Irishman named Malacki Byrne visits Thomas at The Garrison Pub, claiming that he is the cousin of one of the IRA men who had visited previously was shot and killed. He threatens Thomas, so Thomas admits that he has the stolen machine guns, but that he will sell them to him for the right price. Thomas later tells Inspector Campbell of Malacki's situation and makes a deal so that he can give Byrne to the police.\n\nMalacki and Maguire enter the pub, where Grace is hidden at the back with a gun. Thomas speaks with them, and they tell him that they will kill him. Grace reveals herself and shoots Maguire dead, while Thomas fights with Malacki until finally killing him. The police enter far later than they had promised to Thomas, and take away the bodies.\n\nAfter Inspector Campbell finds the machine guns in the fake grave of Danny Whizz-Bang, he hunts for Thomas at The Garrison Pub, but Grace takes Thomas to her home, thereby saving his life. At Grace’s small home, they have sex and Thomas asks her if she’ll stay with him.\n\nThomas comforts his brother Arthur after Arthur attempts suicide, despite the fact that Arthur had stolen money from the Shelby family for their father. He informs Arthur that he is now an equal shareholder of the Shelby Company Limited, and that he owns 1/3 of the company, as do Thomas and John.\n\nThomas informs the Peaky Blinders that today is ‘Black Star Day’, the day in which they take out Kimber and the Lee clan. He discovers Grace’s betrayal, and faces Billy Kimber alone in front of The Garrison Pub with his gang of Peaky Blinders and their machine gun and rifles. Billy Kimber manages to shoot Thomas in the chest, but Thomas is able to shoot him in the head, killing him instantly and ending the short war between the two gangs. Thomas leads a goodbye ceremony to Danny Whizz-Bang, who was killed during the event by Kimber’s men.\n\nThomas writes a letter to Grace telling her that he will give her his decision (whether or not to leave the city with her) in three days.\n\nSeries 2 · 1922\n\nThomas, along with his aunt Polly, find The Garrison Pub destroyed as a result of bombs with confetti.

The Peaky Blinders take interim leadership from Billy Kitchen, the \"Head Baker\".\n\nThomas meets up with Major Campbell, pointing out that the Birmingham police have amusingly put him up in a hostel run by a semi-retired prostitute and brothel owner, indicating that they know of Campbell's secret activities.\n\nAlong with his brothers John and Arthur, Thomas hires men to get themselves arrested overnight on purpose. One of their recruits is the Digbeth Kid, and the plan goes wrong when the boy gets murdered in his cell by Darby Sabini's men. Thomas calls a family meeting about the incident, and informs his family of his plan to buy a racehorse, thus giving them a credible reason to infiltrate the race courses dominated by Sabini's men.\n\nAt the auctions, Thomas meets the aristocratic May Carleton and sees in her an opportunity to move up in the world.\n\nAfter their plan goes south, leading to the death of one of their own, Thomas attends the funeral of the Digbeth Kid, only to get a slap in the face from a mourner, before paying off the family for their trouble.\n\nHe then makes his way to meet Inspector Campbell, who needs him to carry out another assassination, this time of Field Marshal Henry Russell. Upon arrival, he realises Campbell and the pro-Treaty Irish Republicans have been working together all along. Thomas informs Campbell that Donal Henry is a spy reporting every word Campbell tells him back to the anti-treat Paddies, and that he’ll carry out the assassination is if Donal is killed.

Thomas assures Campbell that if he is killed, he’ll have Campbell killed as well.\n\nIn Thomas’s office, he pulls out a letter, dials a number, asks to be connected to the Ritz Hotel in London, and waits. On the other end, a spiffy dude with a New York accent picks up. Thomas doesn’t say anything and disconnects from the line.\n\nNot too long after, Thomas is caught by surprise when his powerbase in London is obliterated, and when his brother Arthur Shelby Jr. and cousin Michael Gray are thrown in jail.\n\nThomas holds a family meeting to figure out how many losses the gang and their connections have taken due to the coppers raiding their bars and business setups. He meets with Inspector Campbell at The Catholic Church. Campbell simply informs Thomas that his reason for throwing Arthur and Michael in jail was to motivate Thomas to properly carry out his task of killing Henry Russell.\n\nThomas takes Grace Burgess to see Charlie Chaplin in person and ends up spending the night with her, where she tells him that she has been trying to have a baby with her husband, but has fears that she may be the cause of her infertility issues.

While doing business, Thomas is stopped by Grace Burgess who says she needs to speak with him as it is an important matter.

The man says, “At some point in the near future, Mr. Churchill will want to speak to you in person, Mr. Shelby.

Thomas makes an announcement that he's planning on getting married, though he does not state to whom.\n\nSeries 3 · 1924\n\nSeries 3 starts with the marriage of Thomas and Grace. After they are married, it's revealed that Thomas now owns a large house in the country, possibly to do with marrying Grace and his gradual increase in success in his business.

This ends with Arthur Shelby killing a man.\n\nDespite living in the country now, Thomas frequently visits his home in Birmingham city and business is good, although he has initial reservations about Arthur's wife.\n\nWhen Grace is shot, he is heartbroken and returns to his much colder demeanour, initially not wanting to speak to his family very much and being very withdrawn from family life, and more so caught up in business with the Russians.\n\nWhen he gets a tip-off that the Priest is working for the Russian family is a double-agent, he attempts to assassinate him but is found out and attacked because of something Polly admitted in confession.

In an episode in Thomas' house in which Tatiana nearly shoots herself playing a frantic and sexualised game of Russian roulette, he breaks down as she keeps mentioning Grace, a tactic to get him to presumably break.\n\nThe initial business he had with Leon was to export large artillery vehicles, which he will get to the destination by having an explosion, implying that the vehicles got blown up when really they will be on a different train- although this gets changed when he finds out that the R\n\nWhen Thomas deviates from the plan and Father Hughes finds out about the tunnel they are digging to retrieve the jewels from the Russian household, he kidnaps Thomas's son, and in return, Thomas has to blow up the train and frame certain people, and at least 6 people have to die.\n\nThomas gets Arthur and John to blow up the train, but in the meantime, Michael finds Father Hughes and cuts his throat with a knife, after Thomas ordered him to kill him.\n\nThomas then returns the jewellery and such to Tatiana, who is waiting to presumably make a getaway somewhere, and informs him that a man is waiting for her. In exchange for the goods, she gives him a large case of money and kisses him, and then asks for money for the sex they had and for helping him get over Grace's death. He rebuffs her, saying, \"You didn't even come close.\"\n\nThe season ends with Thomas paying each of his family members and closest workers a sum of money for their problems, with most of his family angered or annoyed at him for interfering with Russian business in the first place, which he remarks in regard to Arthur, \"You were right.\" He confesses to having made many mistakes and requests them to accept the money that he pays as a means of his apology.\n\nHowever, as Arthur is saying goodbye (as he plans to leave for New York) Thomas comments, \"You won't get far.\" and then proceeds to tell them they will all be arrested for their various crimes and should comply with the police force, reminding them to trust him as he made a deal with people even more powerful than their enemies. They are all angered, and Thomas watches as Arthur, John, Michael and Polly are all handcuffed and taken away.\n\nSeries 4 · 1925-1926\n\nThe series begins around Christmas-time, where we discover that he is largely alienated from his family.

Thomas pushes the company further by expanding it south to London, as well as by sending crates of cars (with hidden bottles of single malt Scotch Whisky inside—these bottles are then sold in North America in order to bring in profits for the company).\n\nIn Series 3, it is shown that thanks to the actions of Thomas and the family over the past few years, the company is even more successful than it had been in the previous series, as it continues to expand and grow, as well as thanks to the cash provided by Winston Churchill.\n\nPersonality\n\nUnlike the Shelby siblings, Thomas is a very calm and observant man, showcasing his wit and ruthlessness to anyone who threatens him or his family. He is widely respected among his local community and is seen as a dangerous foe by his enemies. Under his leadership, the Peaky Blinders have risen from a local Birmingham street gang to a national enterprise that has gone toe-to-toe with the New York Mafia. His experiences in World War 1 have made him fearless and almost impossible to intimidate. Though being a ruthless gangster, Tommy is not heartless, as he has shown great remorse for his actions. By Season 5, Tommy has become severely depressed and unhappy in life and to be suicidal, as he almost kills himself several times in Season 5\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nSPOILERS\n\nLiving... in post-WWI Birmingham, England, with his five siblings and his aunt Polly. It’s a full house and the Shelbys have plenty to do. As important members of the Peaky Blinders, a local criminal gang, “Tommy” and his relatives navigate the treacherous social landscape to solidify their power within the city.\n\nProfession... boss of the Peaky Blinders. His brother Arthur may be older and brawnier, but Tommy has the brains and initiative. Dissatisfied with the group’s current status, he’ll do whatever it takes to dominate. His gang acknowledges his immense efforts: “It is Tommy that has given this family strength and power. You have to be as bad as them in order to survive.”\n\nInterests... smoking, drinking, and gambling. Thomas Shelby indulges in the hobbies of a typical gangster of almost any era. He conducts business with a cigar in his mouth and a glass of whiskey in his hand. He also has a strong interest in horses, largely in part to his Gypsy heritage and businesses in racetracks and gambling.\n\nRelationship Status... single. Warmth and romance aren’t his strengths. If the relationship isn’t strategically valuable, Tommy isn’t interested.\n\nChallenge... holding onto power. With the arrival of Major Campbell – a police chief inspector – and the tireless scrutiny of Sir Winston Churchill, organized crime is facing some tough opposition. Tommy and his Peaky Blinders plan on circumventing the crackdown, but it’s not going to be easy.\n\nPersonality... stoic, intelligent, ruthless, calculating, and ambitious. Tommy is one man you don’t want to cross. Everyone in town knows that “it’s not a good idea to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.” He also suffers symptoms of PTSD ever since coming back from France. Tommy is a master tactician, a war hero, gangster, businessman, politician. He's turned his trauma into relentless ambition to improve his standing among London society.\n\nRelationships\n\nGrace Shelby\n\nThomas first meets Grace shortly after she begins working at his local pub, The Garrison, and quickly grows fond of her. This mutual attraction eventually leads to love, however the relationship is rocked when Thomas discovers that Grace was secretly operating as an agent for the Crown. Despite her mission, she too fell in love with him and urged him to run away to New York with her, escaping both the Crown and the life of a Peaky Blinder. Despite his feelings for Grace, he thankfully declines, opting to stay in Birmingham and lead the Peaky Blinders.\n\nGrace returns two years later, but is married to a wealthy American. Thomas is at first sardonic by her reappearance, but they end up spending the night together, a clear indicator that neither has lost feelings for one another. In the second series finale, Grace tells Thomas that she is pregnant with his child and that it's him, not her husband, who she loves.\n\nAnother two years passes and Grace has given birth to a healthy boy, Charles Shelby, and she and Thomas have married and now live in a country estate. However, her life with Thomas does not come without risk, as Grace is shot and shortly dies, leaving their son solely in the care of Thomas, who remains grieving long after her death and hallucinating her ghost. Photos and paintings of her are kept all around his house in her memory.\n\nLizzie Stark\n\nSeries 1 sees Lizzie engaged to be married to John. Thomas, upon finding out about the marriage, proceeds to test Lizzie, offering her money to sleep with him one last time. She is reluctant at first but takes the money.

Once with the soldier, he becomes violent when she tries to slow things down, and Thomas doesn't arrive until after the soldier is raping Lizzie. Thomas pulls his gun and begins to fight with the man until he is able to shoot him with his own gun. Lizzie is shakily pointing his gun at him, crying and screaming where he was. He attempts to comfort her, but she angrily pushes him away and leaves.\n\nBy the end of Series 4, Lizzie had gotten pregnant and given birth to Thomas' child.\n\nGreta Jurossi\n\nIn Series 4, Thomas turns up out of blue at Jessie Eden’s home looking for knowledge of the Italian family trying to kill the Shelby’s.

He further involves his brother as 1/3 owner of Shelby Company Limited, proving the relationship between the two to be a strong and trustful one.\n\nDespite their closeness, Thomas shows no love for Arthur's actions and attempts at suicide. While he forgives Arthur for giving their father £500 of the Peaky Blinder's money, he expresses contempt at Arthur's failed attempt to hang himself, sarcastically suggesting that next time he shoot himself.

Not wanting to see his brother hurt, Thomas reveals this information to John, causing complications in their relationships and leading to John calling off the engagement. Thomas does, however believe John to be an important member of the Shelby family, arranging for his marriage to Esme Lee, a member of a large gypsy clan.

She later becomes an important figurehead in the family company, Shelby Company Limited.\n\nMay Carleton\n\nThomas and May Carleton’s relationship is that they’re both quite lonely in their own ways.
