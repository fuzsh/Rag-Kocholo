        "text": "Sir Thomas John Woodward OBE (born 7 June 1940) is a Welsh singer known by his stage name Tom Jones. He was born in Pontypridd, South Wales, to a traditional coal-mining family. His career has spanned six decades, from his emergence as a vocalist in the mid-1960s with a string of top hits, regular touring, appearances in Las Vegas (1967–2011), and career comebacks—to coaching on The Voice UK from 2012. Jones's powerful voice has been described as a \"full-throated, robust baritone\" and onstage he played up his sexual appeal\n\nHis performing range has included pop, rock, R&B, show tunes, country, dance, soul and gospel. In 2008, the New York Times called Jones a musical \"shape shifter,\" who could \"slide from soulful rasp to pop croon, with a voice as husky as it was pretty.\" Jones has sold over 100 million records and had a string of hit singles including \"It's Not Unusual\", \"What's New Pussycat\", \"Delilah\", \"Green, Green Grass of Home\", \"Kiss\", and \"Sex Bomb\".\n\nJones received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966, an MTV Video Music Award in 1989, and two Brit Awards: Best British Male in 2000 and the Outstanding Contribution to Music award in 2003. Jones was awarded an OBE in 1999 and in 2006 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to music.\n\nBrowse our unique collection of Tom Jones photos and prints below"
