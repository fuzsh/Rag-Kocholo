        "text": "Background\n\nDavy Jones was born in Manchester, England, to a railway fitter father. Jones’s first play, Tom Sawyer, piqued his interest in entertainment at a young age. Jones lost interest in school after his mother died of emphysema in 1960, and he left home to become a horse-racing jockey. Jones’ apprentice jockey, Basil Foster, spotted Jones’ acting and singing talent, and urged him to continue his acting career.\n\nJones released his first album, simply titled “David Jones,” when he was 20 years old. The comedy series “The Monkees” premiered in September 1966. Jones, together with Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, and Michael Nesmith, was seen by hundreds of people each week. Although popular with teenage girls, the show only ran until 1968. Jones went solo when The Monkees split up, then signed with Bell Records. Before signing with MGM in 1973, he released numerous singles with Bell Records and went on two Japanese tours. He appeared in episodes of “The Brady Bunch” and “Love, American Style.” Jones collaborated on an album and a tour in the mid-1970s with songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, and ex-Monkee Dolenz. Jones joined Toast in the early 1980s and toured extensively in Japan. Following The Monkees’ resurgence on MTV and Nickelodeon, three of the original Monkees (Jones, Dolenz, and Tork) reunited for the album “Pool It!” and a Christmas medley video.\n\nHe married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had been living, in December 1967. Their relationship was kept private until their first child was born in October 1968. With his second wife, Anita Pollinger, whom he married on January 24, 1981, he had two daughters: Jessica Lillian Jones and Annabel Charlotte Jones. The couple divorced during the Monkees’ 30th-anniversary reunion tour in 1996. He married Jessica Pacheco in 2009. He and his wife appeared on “Dr. Phil” in April 2011. Pacheco filed for divorce from Jones in Miami-Dade County, Florida, on July 28, 2011, but canceled the action in October. On the morning of February 29, 2012, he died of arteriosclerosis-related heart failure."
