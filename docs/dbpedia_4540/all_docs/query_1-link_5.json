        "text": "Tom Jones is one of the biggest singing stars of our times, credited with a musical career that has spanned six decades.\n\nNow 83, his career took off in the 1960s, when he recorded some of his biggest hits, continued throughout the 70s and saw a resurgence in the late 1980s and early 90s, and continues today, with a role as a mentor on The Voice UK.\n\nBut while he was known throughout his career as a ladies' man – and once boasted he had sex with up to 250 women a year during the peak of his fame – many are surprised to learn he was married from the age of 16, right up until his wife's death in 2016, to a woman he calls the \"love of [his] life.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Cillian Murphy's 28-year love story\n\nThomas John Woodward was born at 57 Kingsland Terrace in Treforest, Wales, on June 7, 1940. He began singing from a young age at family gatherings, such as weddings, and the school choir.\n\nIn his autobiography, Over the Top and Back, Tom recalled meeting Melinda Rose Trenchard, known as Linda, when they were walking to school when they were just 12.\n\nThey reportedly started dating at 14, and when she fell pregnant, the two married in March 1957, when they were just 16.\n\nTheir only child, Mark, was born shortly after the wedding.\n\nREAD MORE: How Céline Dion's children are helping her through health battle\n\nTo support his young family, Jones began working in the construction industry and at a glove factory.\n\nBut a music career beckoned, and with Linda's encouragement, he became the frontman of a 'beat group', Tommy Scott and the Senators, which won a following in south Wales.\n\n\"The road always leads back to Linda, you know ... some people drift apart, but my wife and I haven't.\"\n\nIt was manager Gordon Mills who suggested Thomas change his name to \"Tom Jones\", which was the name of a popular 1963 film. He got a recording contract with Decca, and released his first song in 1964.\n\nWhile it did not make it on the charts, his next single, It's Not Unusual, became an international hit, reaching number one in the UK in 1965 and making the top 10 in the US.\n\nThat same year, he recorded one of his biggest hits, What's New Pussycat? and won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist the following year.\n\nBut as his fame grew, so did the celebrity lifestyle. After meeting his idol Elvis Presley in 1965, they became good friends, and often partied together in Las Vegas.\n\nAs his popularity began to wane, he reshaped his image, and more hits followed, including I'll Never Fall in Love Again, I'm Coming Home and Delilah.\n\nThe most captivating love stories in popular culture\n\nIn 1967, while performing in Las Vegas for the first time, his on-stage persona was adopted, complete with tight pants and half-opened shirts.\n\nThe 1970s saw more hits, including She's a Lady.\n\nDespite being married and having a child, Jones did not settle down. By his own admission, while his wife stayed at home with son Mark, he slept with hundreds of fans every year at the height of his fame, and embarked on high-profile affairs, which often drew the wrath of his wife.\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Jones' life in photos\n\nA 2012 article in The Mirror detailed a two-year relationship in the late 1960s with Mary Wilson of The ­Supremes, which reportedly ended when Linda found out.\n\nAnother high profile affair began in 1973 with Miss World Marjorie Wallace, who was stripped of her title when their relationship became public. It continued off and on, but when forced to make a choice, he chose his wife.\n\nIn 1987, he agreed to sing on a cover version of the Prince song Kiss. It was a massive hit as were follow-up hits, If I Only Knew, and a cover of You Can Leave Your Hat On.\n\nIn 1988, Jones spent some of the spoils of his success on a mansion in Wales. But the next year, his marriage was rocked by another scandal, this time involving US model Katherine ­Berkery, who alleged she became pregnant to Jones.\n\nLinda stood by him, even telling a reporter she believed him, only to be embarrassed when a DNA test showed he was likely the father. ­Berkery gave birth to a son, Jonathan Berkery, now 35, but the two have reportedly never met.\n\nTom and Linda stayed together, eventually moving to a Los Angeles mansion. Linda was described as 'reclusive' and rarely accompanied her husband to events or travelled with him.\n\nShortly after they relocated, he recorded an album of cover duets with some of the biggest recording artists of the day. Reload was released in 1999, and included another hit, Sex Bomb. That year, he received an OBE and a knighthood.\n\nWhen he released a new album, 24 Hours, in 2008, one song, The Road, stood out as a fitting tribute to his wife, who stood by him.\n\n\"Seen you crying tears of rain, I know I caused you pain, Left you shattered on the ground, But what matters is here and now, 'Cause all that I know is wherever I go, The road always returns to you, My love, it still belongs to you,\" read the lyrics.\n\nAccording to The Mirror article, he was discussing recording a tribute song for his wife, when he was asked how they had stayed married all these years.\n\n\"Well, the road always leads back to Linda, you know,\" he replied.\n\n\"Some people drift apart, but my wife and I haven't. And we are friends. That's another thing. You have to be friends as well.\n\n\"We still have the same basic ­feelings and the same values and we are both Welsh, we come from the same place, so I can't bullsh-- my wife.\"\n\nIn 2012, he joined The Voice UK as a coach and won the series and a legion of new fans. He left the series in 2016, which coincided with the death of Linda in April that year after a battle with lung cancer. They had been married 59 years.\n\nIn 2022, after performing I Won't Crumble With You if You Fall on The Voice UK, he explained what the song meant to him.\n\n\"I'll never love again. There was one love of my life, and that was Linda.\"\n\n\"My wife, she was dying of lung cancer. I was always able to fix stuff, I was always able to do things,\" he said.\n\n\"If she needed me for anything I was always there, but she said, 'You can't crumble with me, don't fall with me now, you've done everything you can, you must carry on and do what you do'.\"\n\nThat year, while speaking on The Joe Wicks Podcast, he was asked about his future. \"I'll never love again. There was one love of my life, and that was Linda.\"\n\nIn a 2021 interview with The Observer, he said his wife's death was \"the lowest part of my life\" but music, and memories of Linda, got him through.\n\n\"I honestly didn't think I was going to get through it,\" he said. \"Now, every time I step on stage, Linda is with me. Before she died, she said, 'Don't think of me dying, think of me laughing' and that's how I remember her.\"\n\nHe continues to perform and work as a coach on The Voice UK, despite having two hip replacements over the years."
