        "text": "Green Green Grass of Home, Tom Jones\n\nGreen Green Grass of Home Lyrics, Composer and Performers\n\nWithout doubt, the Tom Jones version of this song, Green, Green Grass of Home, made this song famous, certainly in Wales but also in the UK and worldwide. Tom recorded and released his version in 1966 and it became a number one bestselling song on the UK singles chart on 1st December that year.\n\nClaude \" Curly\" Putman - Original Composer, Green, Green Grass of Home\n\nClaude \"Curly\" Putman Jr originally wrote the song. It was first performed by Johnny Darrell in 1965 but was then made popular by Porter Wagoner in that year. It was also performed by Jerry Lee Lewis. Tom Jones' version sold over 1 million copies worldwide and his version was a number one or in the top ten singles charts of countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Norway and the USA, to name a few!\n\nOther Famous Welsh Songs\n\nGreen, Green, Grass of Home Lyrics\n\nThe old hometown looks the same\n\nAs I step down from the train\n\nAnd there to meet me is my mama and papa\n\nDown the road I look and there runs Mary Hair of gold and lips like cherries\n\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\n\nYes, they'll all come to meet me\n\nArms reaching, smiling sweetly\n\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\n\nThe old house is still standing\n\nThough the paint is cracked and dry\n\nAnd there's that old oak tree that I used to play on\n\nDown the lane, I walk with my sweet Mary\n\nHair of gold and lips like cherries\n\nIt's good to touch the green, green grass of home\n\nThen I awake and look around me\n\nAt four grey walls that surround me\n\nAnd I realise, yes, I was only dreaming\n\nFor there's a guard and there's a sad, old padre\n\nOn and on, we'll walk at daybreak\n\nAgain, I'll touch the green, green grass of home\n\nYes, they'll all come to see me\n\nIn the shade of that old oak tree\n\nAs they lay me 'Neath the green, green grass of home\n\nGreen, Green, Grass of Home Background and History\n\nWritten by Nashville songwriter Curly Putman, the words to Green, Green, Grass of Home tell the tale of a condemned prisoner who is longing to escape to the green, green grass of home. At the end of the song, it was revealed that the man is facing execution, and he will be coming home only to be buried.\n\nInspiration for the Song\n\nAccording to Putman, part of the inspiration behind writing the words to Green, Green Grass of Home came after watching The Asphalt Jungle. The 1950 film noir directed by John Huston follows a group of men trying to carry out an ill-fated heist.\n\nOne of the characters, Dix Handley, got involved in the heist because of his longing to get out of the city and buy back the Kentucky horse farm he grew up on. However, by the end of the film, Dix found himself gravely wounded and is running from the law. In the final scene, he finally made it back to his old family farm – a rural idyll with rolling hills and a scenic white farmhouse – unfortunately, he died from his gunshot wound.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe words to Green, Green Grass of Home have been interpreted in many different ways over the years. Some see it as a celebration of home and hearth, while others view it as a commentary on the prison of nostalgia and the impossibility of ever recapturing the past.\n\nAt its core, however, the song is a poignant meditation on the human condition, and the way that we are shaped by our memories and experiences. It speaks to the universal desire to return to a simpler time, but also to the knowledge that such a return is impossible.\n\nThe Song's Legacy\n\nThe words to Green Green Grass of Home have become a cultural touchstone and the song has been covered by countless artists over the years. Its themes of love, loss, and the passage of time continue to resonate with listeners of all ages, and it remains one of the most beloved songs of the 20th century. It is arguable that of all of the singers of this song, it is Tom Jones who made the song, Green, Green Grass of Home, truly famous!\n\nAbout Tom Jones\n\nSir Tom Jones, born Thomas John Woodward on June 7, 1940, in Pontypridd, Wales, is a renowned Welsh singer whose powerful voice, charismatic stage presence, and eclectic musical style have made him a global icon.
