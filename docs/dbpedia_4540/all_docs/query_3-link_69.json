        "text": "I've always had a great love for music growing up but I didn't start singing until I was 17 it was my Dad & sister Anne that encouraged me to give it a go finally one night I got up to sing at a karaoke & from then I knew that's what I wanted to do...\n\n​\n\nI then started of doing a few guest spots for various charities doing a tribute to Garth Brooks the word soon started to spread before I knew it I was doing the Tribute more frequently..\n\n​\n\nI've been singing for 25 years now.. I've always sang country Music but its only been this last 5 Years I've focused on Going back to Country Music & the road I want to go down.\n\n​\n\nThe Voice UK has been one of the best & most nerve wrecking things I've done in my career to date. I had to do 5 Auditions before I even got to the TV Stage.\n\n​\n\nI currently have 2 Albums 1st album \"Shake of A Hand\" was Recorded & Produced down in Portaferry with the super Talented Stephen Smyth it features a great mixture of songs some of my Favourite's from the album would be Holes In the Floor of Heaven, Bed Of Roses. I tried to pick songs that tell stories so that anybody listening can relate to the lyrics... My 2nd Album \"Comfort of Her Wings\" was Recorded with Brian Kerrigan in Letterkenny & I'm very Proud to say it went straight to Number 1 in the iTunes Irish Country Music Charts\n\n​\n\nSome of my Best achievements to date would have to be Releasing my 1st Album that would be right up there.. Also appearing on National Television Show BBC The Voice UK in front of Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue,\n\nWill-I-AM, Ricky Wilson & Got to sing with one of the finest bands you will ever hear The Voice UK Band. I've Also sang for Simon Cowell on Britain's Got Talent Getting down to the last 200 people out of thousands.... also being the WINNER of TG4 Show Glor Tire 2019 & Winning 2 Awards at The 1st Northern Ireland Country Music Awards for *Best Male Artist & Best Country Album.....\n\nthese would be some my biggest achievements to date..\n\n​\n\nMy mains aims & goals are to keeping pushing myself out there as much as I can & hopefully get to work with a few musicians to maybe put a band on the road.\n\nExciting times ahead\n\n​"
