        "text": "TOM JONES is the star of the Queen's New Year Honours list, being awarded a knighthood for his services to music.\n\nIt's a fitting end to the Welsh hero's 65th birthday year which he celebrated by performing a sell-out homecoming gig in Pontypridd in May.\n\nTom, veteran of such classics as The Green Green Grass of Home and Delilah, which is a favourite of Welsh rugby supporters, has enjoyed a 40-year career in the spotlight. He scored his first chart-topper with It's Not Unusual in February 1965.\n\nLast night his Welsh family said the global superstar, who began his career in Valleys pubs and clubs and was made an OBE seven years ago, was over the moon with the honour which sees him join the likes of fellow Welshmen Sir Anthony Hopkins and artist Sir Kyffin Williams as a knight.\n\nCousin Jean Thomas said, \"I know Wales, and especially Pontypridd, will be proud of his achievement.\n\n\"I'm sure Tom is delighted.\"\n\nAmong the other Welsh stars honoured in the list is Wales rugby coach Mike Ruddock, who becomes an OBE for services to Welsh rugby after coaching the team to their first Grand Slam Victory for 27 years.\n\n\"It's not about me but it's a reflection of the success the team enjoyed last season,\" he said last night.\n\nHarpist Elinor Bennett has also become an OBE, artist Shani Rhys James is made an MBE and Cherry Short of the Commission for Racial Equality in Wales is honoured with a CBE.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, veteran entertainer Bruce Forsyth is given a CBE and Harry Potter actor Robbie Coltrane gets an OBE.\n\nJoining Tom Jones with a knighthood is musician John Dankworth and playwright and director Arnold Wesker from London who lives in Hay-on-Wye.\n\nThe list strongly features heroes and heroines of the July 7 terrorist attacks in London.\n\nThey have been rewarded for their bravery following the atrocities.\n\nPage 2 - 'Tom will be so proud - he's really earned it'\n\nPage 3 - Well done, Sir Tom!\n\nPage 4 - Fantastic career of the boy from Ponty\n\n'Tom will be so proud - he's really earned it'\n\nTHE insignia of his knighthood will take pride of place pinned to Tom Jones's famous chest.\n\nThe New Year Honour crowns a Welshman at the pinnacle of his career, say music experts.\n\nIt recognises \"services to music\" - the fact that during the 40 years since the 65-year-old scored his first chart-topper with It's Not Unusual, he has sold millions of albums worldwide, amassed a #175m fortune and won the support of thousands of fans who continue to follow him on tour.\n\nAnd the Pontypridd-born singer deserves his new title every bit as much as contemporaries Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Elton John, says Welsh journalist Simon Price, rock and pop critic for the Independent on Sunday.\n\nIn tribute, Simon added that such was Tom's success and fame, \"I don't know what more being knighted can do for his career.\"\n\nLast night Tom was at his home in Los Angeles with his family quietly celebrating his knighthood. News of his honour is announced today on the day after what would have been his beloved late mother Freda's birthday. And it comes seven years after Tom was made an OBE for his services to music in the 1999 New Year Honours.\n\nLast night Tom's first cousin, Dorothy Woodward, who last saw him at his homecoming gig at Ynysangharad Park in Pontypridd in May, said they were delighted there would be a \"Sir\" in the family.\n\n\"He will be so proud to receive the honour,\" said Dorothy, who lives in Caerphilly. \"He really deserves it - he has been at the top of his career for so long and he appeals to all of the generations.\n\n\"He will be absolutely over the moon to be knighted and the family will all be so pleased for him.\n\n\"Next time I speak to him I will call him Sir but in a jovial way.\"\n\nDorothy, 71, remains close to her cousin, despite them now living thousands of miles apart.\n\n\"My parents would always put a party on and we had a piano and Tom loved to sing, as my brothers did. He always sang, from a baby.\"\n\nShe last visited her cousin at his Bel Air home, where he keeps a warm welcome for his family, in 2000 she said.\n\nHis concert at Ponty park, a week before his 65th birthday, was a reunion for the family.\n\n\"When he sang Green Green Grass he pointed up to the row of houses. It was very emotional and I found it very emotional,\" said Dorothy. Asked if he plans to sing again in Pontypridd, she said, \"He says that he would like to, I'm sure. But I have not heard any itinerary.\"\n\nDorothy's brother Idris Jones added that his cousin deserved to be called Sir.\n\n\"He will be very proud. The family will be very proud and very pleased for him.\n\n\"He's worked hard enough for it.\"\n\nThe 77-year-old, of Church Village, said he remembered his cousin beginning his singing career as Tom Woodward, before he took to the stage under his mother's maiden name - Jones.\n\n\"I saw him in the Wood Road Club singing as a 14-year-old boy - that's where he started singing,\" he said.\n\n\"He would come up to the house if we had a party and he would always sing a song, stood on the table.\n\n\"They had a bay window in my mother's. They would put him on the window and draw the curtain and they would announce him and they would say 'Tommy Woodward'.\"\n\n\"He worked in the glove factory and he worked in the paper mills on the Treforest estate, and from a young lad he got into singing.\n\n\"He had a group - The Senators - and they went around touring the Valleys and all of a sudden he was picked up and that was it.\"\n\nAnother cousin, Jean Thomas, said all of the family would be toasting Tom's latest success.\n\n\"He will be emotional when he receives it as he will no doubt be thinking of his mother and father but he's an emotional man anyway,\" she said.\n\nPage 3 - Well done, Sir Tom!\n\nPage 4 - Fantastic career of the boy from Ponty\n\nWell done, Sir Tom!\n\n\"It's about time he received a knighthood. He has done so much for Wales. I've been a big fan of Tom's for so long and he's had such a long and successful career, which is a hard thing to do. When I went on stage to sing Happy Birthday to him during his concert in Pontypridd in May it was definitely one of the highlights of my year.\" - Neath-born mezzo soprano Katherine Jenkins\n\n\"Hit after hit, decade after decade his contribution to music on the world stage has been immense and all the while he has flown the flag proudly for Wales. The concert at Ponty Park was a great start to his celebration year and this acknowledgment has crowned a lifetime of fantastic achievements for a boy from Ponty.\" - Pop Factory founder Emyr Afan, who produced Tom's gig at Ynysangharad Park\n\n\"If he thinks we're going to call him Sir he's got another think coming!\" - Message from Cwmaman trio Stereophonics, who recorded a duet on Tom's Reload album\n\n\"It's brilliant news and he totally deserves it. He has really put Wales on the map and has encouraged a lot of other Welsh people to have big ambitions.\" - Aled Haydn Jones of Radio 1's breakfast show team\n\nPage 4 - Fantastic career of the boy from Ponty\n\nFantastic career of the boy from Ponty\n\nWHEN Tom Jones stood on stage in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd, seven months ago, the homecoming concert marked 40 years in showbiz as well as his 65th birthday.\n\nTom was catapulted to fame in February 1965 when It's Not Unusual topped the charts.\n\nThe track was originally written for barefooted Eurovision Song Contest singer Sandie Shaw.\n\nBut today the song unmistakably belongs to the Pontypridd star and it paved the way for a career which has spanned five decades.\n\nHis next big hit was Green Green Grass Of Home - originally sung by Jerry Lee Lewis - which reached number one in November 1966. It became Elvis Presley's favourite song.\n\nHot on the heels of Green Green Grass Of Home came Detroit City, Funny Familiar Forgotten Feelings, I'll Never Fall In Love Again and I'm Coming Home.\n\nIn February 1968 he recorded what was to become one of his best-loved songs, Delilah, which reached number two. Today it is usually heard at the Millennium Stadium during rugby internationals.\n\nDuring the '70s \"Jones the Voice\" as he fast became known had 10 chart entries and continued to find himself in the charts in the '80s and '90s, with hits like A Boy From Nowhere and his Art Of Noise collaboration, Kiss.\n\nFive years ago he duetted with some of the biggest names in music, including Cerys Matthews, Manic Street Preachers and Stereophonics, on his album Reload.\n\nToday he spends much of his time performing in front of thousands of fans at live shows, particularly in America. And he is, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2005, worth #175m - #10m richer than in 2004.\n\nNot bad for the man who charged just #1 to perform at Treforest Non-Political Club way back in 1957."
