        "text": "Thomas “Tom” D. Jones – Born - 1/3/1931 – Died- 5/29/2024- age 93\n\nTom was born and raised in Pueblo, CO to his parents John D. Jones and Frankie Miller Jones. He attended Mrs Mcintire’s preschool, Somerlid grade school, and graduated from Centennial HS in 1949. Tom attended junior college, then joined the Navy. While in the Navy, Tom served as a radio man on the US aircraft USS Yorktown CV-A10 and USS Hancock CV-A9 during the Korean War. After completing his tour, he returned to Colorado and earned a degree at Colorado State University, graduating in 1958.\n\nIn 1959, Tom married Lillian Whelan (Lil) (they were married for 60 years until her death) and they moved to Grand Island, NE where Tom worked for Texaco Oil. After three years, Tom moved his family back to Denver CO to work for Martin Marietta. He retired from Lockheed Martin in January 1993. During retirement, Tom and Lil lived in Littleton and enjoyed travelling, cruising the Caribbean, Alaska and Montreal. He was very involved in the activities of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren attending their school and sporting events.\n\nTom is survived by his daughters, Patty Jones-Arnold (Dale) and Anne Kellogg (Mike). Grandchildren, Melissa Hageman (Tyler), Amy Borzileri (Tyler), Scott Kellogg (Angela), Liz Riley (Logan) and Brad Arnold (Drew). He has 6 great-grandchildren.\n\nTom is predeceased by his parents, wife Lillian and son Michael.\n\nTom loved riding the range, serving his country while in the Navy and will be remembered for his devotion to his family. Tom was very proud that he was a native of Colorado and particularly Pueblo. Everywhere he went he could find someone with a Pueblo connection. He often said that ‘Colorado doesn’t start until you are south of the El Paso County line’.\n\nTom’s service will be held June 10, 2024 at Ft Logan National Cemetery at 9:00am. Staging area C. A memorial reception will follow at Horan and McConaty at 3101 S. Wadsworth at 10:00am.\n\nPlease share your memories of Tom and condolences with his family by signing the guest book below."
