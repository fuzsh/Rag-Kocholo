        "text": "Jones was born on 28 February, 1942, to Lewis and Louise Jones. He had two sisters, Pamela and Barbara. Pamela died when Brian was still a child. He fathered his first of several children in high school and was subsequently made to leave. In the early 1960s, Brian formed the legendary group, The Rolling Stones. He even gave the group their name and booked their first gigs, working also as their manager for a short time. In 1965, Brian met and fell for stunning model Anita Pallenberg. They began a torrid affair. He composed the music to her film debut, Mord und Totschlag (1967) (\"Degree of Murder\"). He also began drinking and experimenting with drugs. In 1967, Anita left Brian for his bandmate, Keith Richards. Brian fell deeper into drugs and depression. Brian was slowly withdrawing from his social life and his band into isolation. In November 1968, Brian purchased \"Cotchford Farm\", the house was formerly occupied by A.A. Milne, author of the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" tales. The following month, he made his last public appearance with the Stones for their \"Rock and Roll Circus\" special. In June of 1969, Brian and the Stones parted ways. By then, Brian had started to clean up and was planning on forming another group. But on the 3rd of July, Brian was dragged unconscious from his swimming pool and later pronounced dead. He was 27. Mystery still surrounds his untimely death. Some believe it was drugs, some believe an asthma attack, and some even believe he was murdered. In 1999, Brian's ex-girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, who was with him on the night he died, wrote a book stating that Brian was murdered by a friend who had been doing some work to his property. In 1996, some of Brian's fans and friends collaborated and founded the \"Brian Jones Fan Club\"."
