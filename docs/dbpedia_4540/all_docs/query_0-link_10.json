        "text": "Biography\n\nSir Thomas John Woodward, known for his stage name “Tom Jones,” was born in South Wales, Great Britain on June 7, 1940. In 1956, Jones quit school and took a variety of odd jobs to support his wife and child. Seven years later, Tom started his own group named “Tommy Scott and the Senators.” Eventually, he began a solo career and became one of the biggest names in the British Invasion music era. Known for songs like “What’s New Pussycat” and “Delilah,” Tom’s icon songs are still played frequently today.\n\nTom Jones is still writing and recording and released his latest record, “Spirit in the Room” in May of 2012."
