        "text": "There was confusion on social media at the weekend when Tom Jones, the lyricist, director and writer of \"The Fantasticks\", the longest-running musical in history, died from cancer at the age of 95. Predictably, the combination of the name Tom Jones trending and RIP messages led many to believe Welsh singer Tom Jones had died.\n\nIn reality, Sex Bomb singer Tom Jones is actually alive and well. Despite this, it didn't stop thousands of messages dedicated to the Welshman from flooding in. One Facebook post, appearing to deceive users, said: \"At about 11 a.m. ET on Saturday (August 12, 2023), our beloved singer Tom Jones passed away. Tom Jones was born on June 7, 1940 in Pontypridd. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.\"\n\nThe Tom Jones who actually passed away, did so on Friday, August 11 at his home in Sharon, Connecticut, according to Dan Shaheen, a co-producer of \"The Fantasticks\" who worked with Jones since the 1980s. Confusion led to multiple social media accounts across all platform reassuring users the Delilah was not dead.\n\n@IAmMarvinMoore wrote on Twitter: \"Just to be clear, this #TomJones is not dead. The Tom Jones that died is the book writer and lyricist for the the series The Fantasticks\" While @carlosdz posted \"Tom Jones is not dead, I repeat, he is not dead,\" in a post including a TikTok video of Jones performing the 1965 song It's Not Unusual.\n\nAnother user, @vince_dc55, added: \"Let's make this right. #TomJones is trending on Twitter. HE IS NOT DEAD, folks. The other Tom Jones, creator of the longest running musical The Fantasticks, is. He was 95. PHEW! Had me going for a second there\"\n\nThe Tom Jones who did die is a theatre legend who enjoyed decades of success after meeting his long-time Harvey Schmidt at the University of Texas. Jones wrote all of his major musicals with Schmidt, including 110 in the Shade, I Do! I Do!, Philemon, Celebration and their greatest work, The Fantasticks.\n\nThe longest running off-Broadway musical to date, it ran for 42 years until its final performance in 2022 after 17,162 shows. Loosely based on the 1894 play Les Romanesques by Edmond Rostand, it follows concerning two fathers who trick their children, Luisa and Matt, into falling in love by pretending to feud."
