WMVA-FM is owned and operated by Arlis Media.\n\nCoverage area: The station has an effective radiated power of 5,000 watts, but the height above average terrain of the station is 452 meters (1484 feet), meaning the station broadcasts farther than a typical 5,000 watt radio station that broadcasts at normal height. As a result, the station can be heard as far as Charleston, West Virginia"
