        "text": "Meteorologist Josh Nichols, who a year ago made his final appearance on CBS station WROC-TV (Channel 8), has landed on his feet at WKBW-TV (Channel 7) in Buffalo.\n\nNichols will become a full-time meteorologist for the ABC affiliate in July. For now, he is working there part-time while completing the remainder of a part-time freelance assignment at CBS station WBZ in Boston. After exiting Channel 8, and through February of this year, Nichols also freelanced for CBS’ WIVB-TV (Channel 4) in Buffalo.\n\nIn his full-time role at WKBW, he’ll work on Friday, Saturday and Sunday night newscasts and be the primary fill-in meteorologist on the station’s morning show on other days. Viewers also will see him on noon newscasts, and when he’s not on the air, he’ll be involved in building weather graphics and producing.\n\n“That’s the nature of the business now,” he said. “You have to be flexible.”\n\nOriginally from Easton, Massachusetts, which is about 30 miles south of Boston, Nichols started his television career in Rochester, arriving here in 2000 after graduating from Lyndon State College in Vermont to take a job as a weekend and fill-in meteorologist at WHEC-TV (Channel 10). He ended up working at the NBC affiliate for nearly 16 years.\n\nHe joined Channel 8 in April 2016 and in May 2021 announced his departure from the station, describing it on social media as “a business decision that’s been made that I’ve known about for some time.” He later spoke of a broadcast industry “going through a lot of contraction and growing pains” and expressed gratitude for 21 years in the Rochester market.\n\nAs he has for many years, Nichols will continue doing weather forecasts on WXXI radio stations, as well as WLGZ-FM (102.7) and WGMC-FM (90.1).\n\nAnother former Channel 8 broadcaster, Lia Lando, is taking on a new role at WKBW, too, as an evening news anchor, The Buffalo News reports.\n\nLike Nichols, prior to joining Channel 8, Lando worked at Channel 10. For a period, the Corning native and Nichols appeared together on WROC’s \"News 8 at Sunrise\" show.\n\n“Two-thirds of the old 'Sunrise' crew is now at WKBW,” Nichols joked.\n\nHe added that he plans to continue living in Rochester and is happy he’ll be able to expand his forecasting work into Buffalo. “We really have more in common than we think,” he said of the two upstate cities.\n\nOther media moves\n\nAlso getting established in the Buffalo market is former Rochester radio personality Megan Carter. Late last month, she announced she had been hired to host weekday afternoons on Buffalo country station WYRK-FM (106.5), owned by Townsquare Media.\n\nIn March, Carter lost her job at iHeartMedia station WAOI-FM (95.1), better known as Radio 95.1, when the “Earl David Reed Show,” which she had co-hosted since its launch in August 2020, was canceled.\n\nBefore that, Carter, who grew up in Schenectady, worked afternoons on WKGS-FM, “KISS” 106.7. Previously, she was a longtime morning show host and music director at WPXY-FM (97.9).\n\nIn mid-May, Cristina Domingues, who for two decades worked as a reporter and anchor at what is now called Spectrum News 1 (cable channel 9), announced she was leaving the TV news business. About two weeks later, Domingues, a first-generation American born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, revealed she had accepted a public relations job with Rochester Regional Health system, whose facilities include Rochester General Hospital and Unity Hospital."
