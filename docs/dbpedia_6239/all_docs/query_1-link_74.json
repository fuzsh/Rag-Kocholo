        "text": "Do you have a local station which plays 1930's or 40's music?\n\nWe actually had *two* such stations not so long ago, an AM and an FM, both locally programmed. (I worked at the AM station in the late '80s, and it's the only radio job I had where I could actually play 78's on the air without dubbing them to carts first.)\n\nBut now all the stations in this market are owned by Clear Channel, which programs them with inane satellite formats. I still think there's a market for a vintage-format station here, given the demographic we get at the theatre, but the corporate overlords who own the stations obviously don't agree...\n\nBegintheBeguine\n\nMy Mail is Forwarded Here\n\nMessages\n\n3,498\n\nLocation\n\nRochester, NY originally from Atlanta, Georgia\n\nLegends 990 WLGZ, mixes in new songs too.\n\nToronto's CHWO AM 740 also mixes in new songs. These are both AM. Nothing on FM. They both have real announcers too!\n\nRosie\n\nOne Too Many\n\nMessages\n\n1,827\n\nLocation\n\nBed Stuy, Brooklyn, NY\n\nI think the closest we have is 88.3 which is a jazz station so they sometimes play jazz from that era. There was the CBS channel which played \"oldies\" from the 30's -50's but they go taken over by Jack Radio which is a \"robo dj\", totally automated, no on air personality which was met with much protesting in the city. Stations will do anything to make as much money as possible.\n\nArchie Goodwin\n\nOne of the Regulars\n\nMessages\n\n167\n\nLocation\n\nNew Orleans\n\nTwo, sort of\n\nIn New Orleans, we have Martini 106.1 where you can hear Dean, Frank, Ella, Louis, Brian Setzer, Harry Connick Jr., etc. We also have 90.7 WWOZ that does traditional jazz, contemporary jazz, Blues, R&B Blues, New Orleans Music, Jazz Roots, Jazz From the Market, Swing & Big Band, Zydeco, Old Time Country and Bluegrass, etc.\n\nBoth stations include 30's and 40's music, but neither do so exclusively.\n\nThe Wolf\n\nCall Me a Cab\n\nMessages\n\n2,153\n\nLocation\n\nSanta Rosa, Calif\n\nnot really\n\nWhen people \"know\" the kind of music I like they recommend a local jazz station. Whenever i turn it on I get \"smooth jazz\", Kenny G. or some such thing.[huh]\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Wolf\n\nHarp\n\nI'll Lock Up\n\nMessages\n\n8,508\n\nLocation\n\nChicago, IL US\n\nBig Bands and All That Jazzzzz\n\nWGN Radio here in Chicago had a Sunday nite Big Band/Jazz\n\nprogram hosted by the late Mike Rapchek, a former US POW held in\n\nGermany. With his passing, the station folded the show and reverted\n\nto another inane talk format.\n\nThere is a \"Jazz\" station on the Chicago FM dial; however, this place\n\nonly owns a dozenlol records or so, playing over, over, over, again.\n\nBecause there is a market for Big Band/Jazz, I cannot understand\n\nlocal radio mgt myopia.\n\nSome old stuff in LA\n\nThere was a pretty good station that did some big band and popular music from the early 60's back to the 30's but they got eaten up. Any way there is another station that comes from Mexico on the AM band but it doesn't come in well all over. I think it is either 540 or 560 am and they have another band of the same at 1240 or 1280 am if I remember right. Again, it just doesn't come in all places but maybe you'll be the lucky one.\n\nHarp\n\nI'll Lock Up\n\nMessages\n\n8,508\n\nLocation\n\nChicago, IL US\n\nSignals\n\nI'm surrounded by skyscrapers in this concrete and asphalt\n\nneon-lit no big band/jazz radio stations jungle.\n\nI'm lucky that I can pick-up Notre Dame football on WLS 89*.\n\nI do! KWD 1630 AM broadcasts music from the swing era and radio programs from the 30s, 40s, and 50s and nothing else. And it's literally in my backyard. I run the programming off my computer using software available free on the net. Even the news broadcasts are from the golden age. Unfortunately, it only reaches out about a half-mile from my house.\n\nWKHR\n\nAll 30's, 40's, 50's,....hey! Where did this forum come from? [huh]\n\nJust noticed this seperate area and I like it. It's a great idea with the perfect hostess too.\n\nD\n\ndrafttek\n\nGuest\n\nI haven't found any in my area, south of Boston, but I do listen to KCEA on the internet. It's a high school station out of California. I like the mix of songs they play and no commercials either.\n\nhttp://www.kcea.org/history.html\n\nMike in Seattle\n\nMy Mail is Forwarded Here\n\nMessages\n\n3,027\n\nLocation\n\nRenton (Seattle), WA\n\nKUOW here in Seattle has a show every Saturday evening called The Swing Years and Beyond. It's all music from the 20's through 40's. It's a great show - I know I've mentioned it here on FL on other posts, but here goes again. Here's a link to each week's broadcast repeats. Scroll down and click te \"LISTEN\" link.\n\nHarp\n\nI'll Lock Up\n\nMessages\n\n8,508\n\nLocation\n\nChicago, IL US\n\nLink to Swing Years\n\nThanks Mike. All I need to do now is fix my computer's\n\nsound system!\n\nPaisley\n\nI'll Lock Up\n\nMessages\n\n5,439\n\nLocation\n\nIndianapolis\n\nEverything from Soup to Nuts\n\nWe have an AM station called KEZW, which has been around for ages. It plays 40s to 80s (Everthing from Sinatra to the Karen Carpenter) and has a bunch of talk shows (restaurant show, car guys). The talk is usually on when I want to hear music.\n\nBut there is a pretty AM good station that plays 50s through 70s rock that I like. This morning they played \"Take a Letter, Maria\" and \"Papa was a Rolling Stone\" within one hour.\n\nWe have an excellent station here in SE Penna. It's WRDV 89.3. They play swing M-F daytime, then a mix of old R&B/jump blues, classic country, doo-wop & 1920's hot jazz on various evening & weekend programs. You can listen to it on the net at: www.wrdv.org Click on the red radio on the top right. The only annoying part is the cheesy PSA's (hey, it's a community radio station).\n\nI'm surprised Dallas hasn't tuned in on this one.\n\nThere is a college radio station that plays everything from big band to bepop to rap, out of Denton on 88.1 I don't listen to it.\n\nAM radio has a show, but darned if I remember when it's on, or what channel it's on. I gave up and listen to CDs.\n\nElaina\n\nfunneman\n\nPractically Family\n\nMessages\n\n851\n\nLocation\n\nSouth Florida\n\nLocal Radio...\n\nOne of the Radio Stations I'm currently working on is 640 WJNA in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nIt's modeled after the \"Jack\" stations in California and is home to some of the strangest segues I've ever heard.\n\nThey will go from the Andrew Sisters into Air Supply or Kay Star into Abba.\n\nYou truly never know from one minute to the next what's going to come out of the speaker!\n\nAnd that wonderful analog hum of AM Radio really gives those old recordings the fidelity they deserve.\n\nS\n\nsparrow\n\nGuest\n\nThose Were The Days in Chicago\n\nToday I reaquainted myself with the only Chicagoland broadcast of old time radio. The College of Dupage radio station out of Morton Grove at 90.9 has a Saturday afternoon radio show called Those Were the Days which plays music and shows from the 30s through the 50s from 1 to 5 p.m. It's got a strong signal that I can pick up from the far North Side down to Lakeview (possibly beyond?) They'll be having a special Halloween show in two weeks that's supposedly a real scream!"
