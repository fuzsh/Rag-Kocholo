        "text": "Congratulations to Mike Vickers on selection to his biggest Disc Jockey (DJ) gig forever! The loving energy of his beautiful smile, kind gentle baritone voice, and impeccable taste in music made him the natural choice to help direct the biggest celebration imaginable, a heavenly party which he began January 31st, 2022. Mike started training for this new gig in Baltimore, Maryland on March 10th, 1953, born to his parents William and Lillian Vickers who went before him to prepare for his heavenly arrival. After preparation in Catholic grammar school, Mike went into a high school where his beautiful speaking voice put him on track for training in the radio industry. It was there where he developed his love for pop music and automobiles.\n\nMike moved to Rochester specifically to work as a DJ and he plied his trade at WBBF, WCMF, WRMM, and finally at WLGZ where he spun the oldies on Sunday afternoons. He was beloved by his fellow radio family members and families around the Rochester area who hired him to DJ parties. While working in the Rochester area he met the love of his life, Deloris Alexander whom he married November 24, 1994. Deloris and the Regional Transit Service (RTS) both felt Mike should have more “steady work.” Since Mike loved driving and people, driving RTS buses was a natural solution and Mike loved maneuvering the big buses for RTS.\n\nHe is especially cherished by his church family at St. Charles Borromeo where he was well known as a dapper dresser and patron of the amazing choir at St Charles. Mike contributed his beautiful voice as lector and master of ceremonies for fund raising events of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society. His church friends became family and supported him after his loss of Deloris on July 7th, 2015. As Mike’s memory faltered he leaned on his beloved church family until he became a ward of the state with the Catholic Family Center as his guardian. The staff and residents at Hill Haven and The Villages of Orleans County nursing homes loved his engaging personality. All who knew Mike highly recommended him for the new DJ gig forever.\n\nCalling hours for Mike’s Church, radio, and RTS families will be held Friday (March 4th) 6-8 PM at Vay-Schleich and Meeson Funeral Home, 1075 Long Pond Road. His Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St Charles Borromeo Catholic Church March 5th 11:30 AM. Private Interment, Mt. Hope Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to The St Vincent de Paul Society at St Charles Borromeo or Catholic Family Center in his memory."
