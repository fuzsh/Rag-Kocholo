        "text": "History\n\nThe station went on the air as WLMF on August 23, 1991. On October 30, 1992, the station changed its call sign to WFUL, on February 3, 1993 to WDCZ, on August 1, 1997 to WDCZ-FM, on January 1, 2004 to WRCI.[2]\n\nOn February 11, 2008, the station, then owned by Crawford Broadcasting, ended its longtime Contemporary Christian format as WRCI \"102.7 The Light\" to make way for \"Legends 102.7\", a Classic Hits/Adult Standards hybrid. The \"Legends\" format was already featured on 990 AM WLGZ, which after simulcasting of the FM signal turned to a religious format, and now carries the calls WDCX, along with much of the programming of Buffalo FM sister station WDCX-FM.\n\nWLGZ was purchased by DJRA Broadcasting on January 1, 2010. Following WLGZ's sale from Crawford to DJRA, most Adult Standards titles were dropped from the station's playlist and WLGZ morphed into a straightforward Classic Hits outlet featuring hits of the '50s, '60s and '70s. The format change for WLGZ has succeeded in substantially increasing the station's audience. According to the Spring 2010 Arbitron ratings, the station was tied for 4th place in the Rochester market. The station's license was assigned to DJRO Broadcasting LLC on June 1, 2012. A noteworthy fact about this station is that they have not completely discarded songs and artists from the early-1960s, which are typically shunned by Classic Hits stations (and only receive airplay on the dying breed of stations branded as \"Oldies\"), although this station has adapted its playlist to feature a greater proportion of songs from the 1970s and 1980s, in order to keep with the times."
