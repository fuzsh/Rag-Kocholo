        "text": "It turns out that 13WHAM’s Glenn Johnson isn’t the only longtime Rochester meteorologist signing off the air for good on Thursday.\n\nWROC-TV’s Josh Nichols announced on Twitter that today was his last broadcast on the CBS affiliate after five years.\n\nAs to the reason, he wrote: “The answer is a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that it is a business decision that’s been made that I’ve known about for some time now. And now I’ve come to the day that I must say so long to my TV viewers.”\n\nLater reached by phone, he said, \"The broadcast industry is going through a lot of contraction and growing pains, is the only way I can put it. But this is something we're all facing as TV meteorologists across the board. It's just a changing chessboard.\"\n\nHe added, \"I've been in this market for 21 years, and it's been an absolute delight to serve the Rochester community, and my hope is to carry on here.\"\n\nNichols, 42, was part of the News 8 at Sunrise crew and appeared on WROC's noon newscast. In a tweet, Lia Lando, co-anchor of the 5 a.m. show, wrote, “I know you will miss waking up at 1:30 a.m.”\n\nNichols also does weather forecasts on WXXI radio stations, as well as on WLGZ-FM (102.7) and WGMC-FM (90.1) and said he plans to continue doing so.\n\nA native of Easton, Massachusetts, about 30 miles south of Boston, he came to Rochester in 2000 to take a job as a weekend and fill-in meteorologist at WHEC-TV (Channel 10).\n\nThat position was offered to him by Kevin Williams, the NBC affiliate’s former chief meteorologist. Following Nichols’ announcement about his Channel 8 departure, Williams put out his own tweet, writing that Nichols has “since served viewers admirably. Sadly, his current employer — forgoing expertise, experience & loyalty (where have I seen that before?), has made a ‘business decision’ making today his last day. Blue Skies, Josh!”\n\nNichols said he was lucky to be hired at Channel 10 at such a young age.\n\n\"A lot of people don't start at 21 in a market like Rochester, so I've been very blessed,\" he said.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2010, he also taught a weather and climate course as an adjunct lecturer at Monroe Community College.\n\n“I estimate hundreds of students from all across Western New York and the Finger Lakes passed through my classroom,” according to his biography on Channel 8’s website. “I so valued the opportunity to bring my passion for meteorology into the classroom to impart my knowledge on the mysteries of the atmosphere.”\n\nNichols earned a bachelor of science degree in meteorology and an associate’s degree in communications in 2000 from Lyndon State College in Lyndonville, Vermont.\n\nIn his bio, he described a longtime fascination with the weather and about his father giving him a weather radio as a 12th birthday gift, which further fueled his interest. His first broadcast experience was in high school delivering weather reports during morning announcements over the school’s intercom system.\n\nIn 2007, Nichols became the first TV meteorologist in Rochester to earn the status of certified broadcast meteorologist through the American Meteorological Society, considered the highest seal of approval for TV meteorologists.\n\n“Hopefully I will be able to greet you on the TV side sometime in the near future,” he wrote Thursday on Twitter and reiterated that later by phone, saying, \"It's not goodbye, it's just so long for now.\"\n\nA message left for Channel 8 vice president and general manager Wendy Bello was not immediately returned.\n\nMore:13WHAM chief meteorologist Glenn Johnson speaks out on being laid off and on what's next."
