        "text": "SET IN CONCRETE. Coastal Concrete Pumping Inc., of Wallace, recently acquired a Danish-owned company, Carolina Concrete Pumping of Charlotte. As a result, the company changed its name to Coastal Carolina Pumping Inc.\n\nRoss Sykes, one of four owners, said the company would continue to operate offices throughout the state – namely Raleigh, Clinton, Wallace and Charlotte – but the corporate headquarters will be in Charlotte.\n\nThe concrete company owns 85 concrete pumps. The pumps enable contractors to accurately place, rather than pour, concrete, Mr. Sykes said.\n\nCoastal is now the largest concrete pumping company in the Carolinas and the fifth largest in the United States, he said.\n\nCHANGING CALL LETTERS. Wilmington Broadcasting Co., owner of WLGZ Smooth Jazz 106.7, said the station’s call letters will change Jan. 15 to WJZY-FM JAZZY 106.7.\n\nJAZZY 106.7 will continue to air contemporary smooth jazz but will add more classic jazz and blues. The station has specially produced programs of traditional jazz and blues, and an hour of contemporary bluegrass music on the weekends.\n\nSHELL ISLAND REDO. Juan Fernandez, regional food and beverage director for MHI Hotels, said Shell Island Oceanfront Resort has begun construction on a 4,000-square-foot ballroom and restaurant.\n\nThe project, which will include a 2,000-square-foot lounge, is slated to be finished by June 1, at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. The ballroom, which will accommodate up to 350 people, had been vacant space.\n\nCHECK IT OUT. Thomas Rambach has started www.gowilmington.com – a nightlife and entertainment guide for the area."
