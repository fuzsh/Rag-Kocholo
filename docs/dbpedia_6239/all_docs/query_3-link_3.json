        "text": "CJGY-FM is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts a Contemporary Christian format at 96.3 FM in Grande Prairie, Alberta. The station received approval in 2006 and launched on December 3, 2007 as 96.3 Shine FM. In 2013, the station re-branded as 96.3 Reach FM, although no change in format was made.\n\nCJLF-FM is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting a Contemporary Christian music format on 100.3 FM in Barrie, Ontario. Using the on-air brand name Life 100.3, the station was founded by Scott Jackson in August 1999 and is owned by Trust Communications Ministries, Inc, which is based in Barrie, Ontario. On August 27, 2006, CJLF-FM increased its power from 1.8 kW to 18.7 kW. This move was supported by many motorists who lost reception of the station while commuting to and from Toronto along Highway 400. As well, since there are no FM Christian stations in Toronto, it also serves the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area. The power was further increased to 40 kW in January 2007.\n\nCJRY-FM is an FM Christian radio station that broadcasts on 105.9 FM from Edmonton, Alberta. The station uses the on-air brand Shine FM often with the tag-line \"Safe and Fun for the Whole Family!\", referencing the core goal of the station, and mainly plays contemporary Christian music. CJRY received approval by the CRTC in 2003 and first aired in September 2004. Owned by Touch Canada Broadcasting Inc., CJRY currently has three sister stations: AM 930 CJCA in Edmonton, CJSI-FM in Calgary and CJGY-FM in Grand Prairie."
