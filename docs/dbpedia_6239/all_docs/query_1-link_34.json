        "text": "On Veterans Day, we honor Americans who have served our country in the Armed Forces. For the American Red Cross, November 11 is a day to salute our men and women in uniform and reflect on the origins of the organization, which dates back to the Civil War when Founder Clara Barton began caring for wounded warriors. Today, the Red Cross continues to serve members of the military, veterans and their families by helping them prepare for, cope with, and respond to the challenges of military service.\n\nIn observance of this important national holiday, Legends 102.7-FM WLGZ and the St. Joseph’s Knights of Columbus Council 15471 are partnering with the Red Cross for a special blood drive. The Legends 102.7 FM Blood Drive will be held at St. Joseph’s Church, 43 Gebhardt Road in Penfield, on November 11 from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nThis is the tenth blood drive hosted by the St. Joseph’s Knights of Columbus Council 15471. The organization hosts two blood drives every year.\n\n“Our lifesaving mission would not be possible without the support of community partners like Legends 102.7 FM and St. Joseph’s Knights of Columbus Council 15371 and our dedicated blood donors,” said Red Cross New York-Penn Blood Services Region District Manager Debra Dunn. “We are urging all eligible donors to help patients in need by donating blood.”\n\nDonors are needed before the start of the holiday season as many regular donors delay giving between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day because of holiday activities. This often causes a drop in donated blood available for patients. Therefore, more donations are needed in the weeks leading up to the holidays to help ensure the blood supply is sufficient through the winter months.\n\nIn addition, Hurricane Matthew and its devastating aftermath have forced the cancellation of more than 100 blood drives in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, resulting in thousands of uncollected blood and platelet donations. This has had a major impact on our national blood supply.\n\nIndividuals who are 17 years of age (16 with parental consent in most states), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements.\n\nEvery two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood.\n\nHow to donate blood\n\nSimply download the American Red Cross Blood Donor App, visit redcrossblood.org or call 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) to make an appointment or for more information. All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients. A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements.\n\nBlood donors can now save time at their next donation by using RapidPass to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online, on the day of their donation, prior to arriving at the blood drive. To get started and learn more, visit redcrossblood.org/RapidPass and follow the instructions on the site.\n\nAbout the American Red Cross:\n\nThe American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a not-for-profit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.
