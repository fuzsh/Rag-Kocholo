        "text": "CFZM is a Canadian Class A clear-channel radio station, licensed to Toronto, Ontario, which airs at 740 kHz on the AM radio dial. The station airs a pop standards format branded as Zoomer Radio, with the slogan \"The Best of the Best, AM 740\". Its studios are located in the Liberty Village neighbourhood, while its transmitter is located in Hornby. CFZM is perhaps the only remaining adult standards-formatted station in North America that broadcasts a 50,000-watt clear channel signal. The station's nighttime signal blankets most of the eastern half of North Americaâ€”including three-fourths of Canada and just over half of the United States. It can reach as far west as Minneapolis and Winnipeg, and as far south as Atlanta. CFZM's daytime signal can be heard as far north as Georgian Bay; as far south as Youngstown, Ohio; as far east as eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire including Nashua, Lawrence and Portsmouth; and as far west as the Michigan Thumb.\n\nKAAM, known as \"K-Double-A-M\", is an AM radio station broadcasting in the Dallas/Fort Worth \"Metroplex\" with a format of nostalgic/oldies, plus financial, health and lifestyle programs. This station is licensed in Garland, Texas, USA and is owned and operated by DJRD Broadcasting, LLC. KAAM is a Class B station operating on the frequency of 770 AM."
