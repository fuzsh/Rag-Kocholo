In her free time, she likes to watch sci fi shows on netflix. Over the summer she wrote some articles and gave some presentations in a desperate attempt to get media badges to some science fiction conventions. She also taught herself how to sew pants and build bookcases.\n\nArchives\n\nMarch 2020\n\nOctober 2019\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nAugust 2019\n\nApril 2019\n\nMarch 2019\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nNovember 2018\n\nOctober 2018\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nAugust 2018\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nOctober 2017\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nAugust 2017\n\nApril 2017\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nOctober 2016\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nAugust 2016\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nNovember 2015\n\nOctober 2015\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nApril 2015\n\nMarch 2015\n\nFebruary 2015\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nNovember 2014\n\nOctober 2014\n\nSeptember 2014\n\nAugust 2014\n\nApril 2014\n\nMarch 2014\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nNovember 2013\n\nOctober 2013\n\nSeptember 2013\n\nAugust 2013\n\nCategories\n\nAll\n\nRSS Feed"
