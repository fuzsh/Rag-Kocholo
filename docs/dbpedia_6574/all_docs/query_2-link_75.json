        "text": "Carrie Shemanski\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nTaste — Movies & TV\n\n·\n\n7 min read\n\n·\n\nOct 28, 2021\n\n--\n\nIf you really want to creep yourself out this Halloween, read about what it was like on the set of some of your favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.\n\nIt’s no secret that in addition to being the “master of suspense”, Hitchcock was also the master of toxic masculinity. Actresses in some of his films suffered everything from rude behavior to mental and physical abuse at his hand.\n\nThat’s not to be glossed over, nor is it to be celebrated in the name of “getting a good performance” (or any other nonsense that his apologists tend to spew). I’m not sure if the films on this list are good in spite of the misogynist behind the camera, or if they’re even more unsettling to watch because of it, but either way, I feel conflicted.\n\nDespite my internal struggle, I love these movies. All of these films have scenes that make my shoulders get tense and send my heart into my throat. They make me want to yell “Get out of there!” to Grace Kelly from across the courtyard or “HE’S the mother!” to, well, you know.\n\nThese films prove that seeing a bloody murder isn’t half as terrifying as anticipating a bloody murder, and if there’s ever a time to dig deep into man’s darkest impulses — real and imaginary — it’s Halloween. This weekend, turn yourself over to the masterful storytelling and wacky camera angles of these films, and whatever you do, stay out of the shower.\n\n10. North by Northwest (1959)\n\nOne of Hitchcock’s most famous films is also admittedly one of the most tame. Though not explicitly violent or terrifying per se, North By Northwest explores the horror of being misunderstood. Cary Grant is at his charming best here, playing goofy one second and deathly serious the next. This film is genuinely fun, and iconic scenes like “running from an airplane” and “being chased up Mount Rushmore” still get your heart pumping. North by Northwest is a great choice for the squeamish folks out there who’d prefer to watch something unnerving this Halloween over a more gruesome selection.\n\n9. Shadow of a Doubt (1943)\n\nCharlie is a girl named after her big city Uncle Charlie. She’s thrilled when he comes to visit her boring old hometown, but soon begins to suspect that he might be a murderer. In classic “the call is coming from inside the house” style, once girl-Charlie begins to suspect her uncle of these awful things, she simply can’t get away from him. In a way, Shadow of a Doubt is a coming of age story about something we all experience at one point or another: the nightmare of realizing your family members are just people… with flaws.\n\n8. Rope (1948)\n\nRope has everything: true crime, homoerotic undertones, and Jimmy Stewart showing up 28 minutes in and inventing The Purge. This underrated bottle episode of a film takes place in practically real time inside one New York City apartment. Our anti-heroes, Phillip and Brandon, are scholarly gentlemen who share said apartment in a Bert and Ernie sort of way. After murdering their friend in the opening scene, they stuff his body in a wooden chest, then host a dinner party in the same room. The chest looms in the foreground of virtually the whole film, so what Rope lacks in traditional horror gore, it more than makes up for in excruciating dramatic irony. It’s not about to pass the Bechdel test with flying colors, but it might be the only film on this list where nothing all that terrible happens to any of the women in it.\n\n7. Rebecca (1940)\n\nPerhaps the most ghostly of Hitchcock’s films is Rebecca, which explores the creepiness of playing third wheel to your eccentric husband’s dead ex-wife. Without making an appearance as a literal ghost, Rebecca de Winter haunts everything about the Maderley estate, from its billowing curtains to its sinister staff. The poor new Mrs. de Winter, try as she might, simply can’t fill her shoes. Her missteps at times read as comically off-base as Ben Stiller’s in Meet the Parents, but instead of losing a cat, she freaks everybody out when she’s tricked into wearing one of Rebecca’s old dresses to a costume party. Creepiest party foul ever.\n\n6. Vertigo (1958)\n\nIf you plan to partake in some edibles this Halloween, allow me to recommend Vertigo. Watching it is like walking around in a dream world. It’s one of the most visually appealing films on this list, with a carefully crafted color palette and wackadoo spiral themes. As fun as it is, the way it distorts reality is genuinely terrifying. Vertigo contains some of the earliest examples of the use of the “dolly zoom”, which would go on to be used in films like Jaws and Goodfellas to create a sense of unease. On top of that, it boasts a spooky score by Bernard Herrmann, who’s responsible for the music in other Hitchcock films like Psycho and The Man Who Knew Too Much, as well as the iconic films Citizen Kane and Taxi Driver.\n\n5. The Birds (1963)\n\nA few years ago, a hypothetical question started going around: would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses? The Birds reminds us that it would be equally terrifying to fight a bunch of regular ducks. Though the premise comes with an inherent silliness, that feeling fades fast when you see how quickly a bunch of seagulls can peck a guy’s eyeballs out. By the time the titular birds have caused a gas station to explode, you’re apologizing to the birds outside your window for ever doubting their sheer numbers.\n\n4. Dial M for Murder (1954)\n\nRotary phones that you could dial yourself didn’t become a household item until the 1950’s, so this title is up there with FearDotCom in terms of spookifying new technology. It involves many tried and true Hitchcockian plot devices — adultery, money troubles, and crafting “the perfect murder” — but has even more twists and turns than some of the others on this list. I’ve always found this one to be criminally underrated, as every single character is weaving a tangled web of lies that result in some extreme outcomes. Because we always know more about the characters than they do about each other, you’ll find yourself screaming at the TV more than a few times.\n\n3. Strangers on a Train (1951)\n\nWhaddya know, another film about getting away with the perfect murder! If you ever ride planes, trains, or public transit, you’ve probably experienced the sheer terror of a stranger trying to make small talk. Imagine said stranger wants to chit chat about how cool it would be if you each committed a murder for the other, because who would ever suspect the murders of two strangers were connected? You’d probably get off the train shaking your head at how kooky he was, but what would you do if this psychopath held up his end of the bargain? End up having an amazing chase scene on a carousel, that’s what!\n\n2. Rear Window (1954)\n\nAfter all this talk about the perfect murder, it’s time we talked about the perfect movie. For me, Rear Window is Hitchcock’s best. Sorry to my neighbors, but I think about it every single day when I look out my apartment window. If you’re one of those people who compulsively listens in on other tables’ conversations at restaurants, you’re going to like this one too. I would happily tune in while certified hotties Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart watch paint dry, so watching them work together to solve a murder really has me swooning. Sorry Only Murders in the Building, but this is the definitive text on solving neighborly crimes.\n\n1.Psycho (1960)\n\nSome legendary films live up to the hype, and Psycho is one of them. If you haven’t watched it in a while, you may be surprised at how many more truly terrifying sequences are in this film besides the legendary shower scene. It’s definitely Hitchcock’s scariest, and launched a thousand sad-boy-with-a-knife horror villains. Without Psycho, we may not have slasher classics like Halloween, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, or Scream. Even if you leave the legacy out of it, it stands on it’s own as a perfectly terrifying story that’s tight as a drum."
