        "text": "What It’s About: Author Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is in a major car crash and was helped by his biggest fan and former nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Her obsession comes through after she discovers that he is killing off her favorite character from his series and forces him to write what she wants.\n\nHow It Builds Suspense Well: There is no limit to a person’s mind or obsession. When Paul becomes incapacitated by his injuries he sustained from the crash, he is at his most vulnerable as a prisoner. Early on, the audience discovers that Annie’s passion has no bounds and there’s no telling what she will do to keep her favorite fictional character “alive.” This inability to know what the character will do next is what keeps the movie suspenseful in its entirety.\n\nScene That Makes You Hold Your Breath: Once Paul learns that he is Annie's prisoner, he begins planning his escape. He manages to leave his room whenever Annie is out. In one tense sequence, Paul sends Annie out to buy paper for the novel she's forcing him to write, only to realize - possibly too late - that this errand didn't take as long as he thought it would.\n\nWhat It's About: Top FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is tasked with interviewing current prisoner, psychiatrist, serial killer, and cannibal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), in hopes of getting insight into a case that they are struggling to solve.\n\nHow It Builds Suspense Well: With a serial killer who is beyond intelligent with an affinity for beautiful women and an FBI student who matches this description in terms of wit and beauty, this is quite a cat-and-mouse game. Although her goal is to learn details about Lecter’s past that she can use to help identify and capture the Buffalo Bill killer, the scenes drip in suspense. From Lecter asking Starling to come closer to his cell, to Starling granting some of his requests in order to get the coveted information, there’s a sinking feeling that two murderers will have to be caught. With the excess of protection, guards, cells, and weapons, the audience is left wondering how can Lecter successfully escape and what will he do when he does.\n\nScene That Makes You Hold Your Breath: Starling discovers that her interview subject is the murderer, Buffalo Bill, and she is alone in his home without backup. She needs to save a girl’s life and her own while outsmarting the killer who has been one step ahead all along.\n\nWhat’s It About: Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family move into the Overlook Hotel, which he becomes the caretaker of in hopes that the change of scenery will cure his writer’s block. His son, Danny (Danny Lloyd) begins to have visions and premonitions while his father uncovers the hotel’s secrets, which cause him to lose control and become a murderous maniac.\n\nHow It Builds Suspense Well: This film proves that one of the greatest horrors doesn’t come from gore, but one’s own mind. The movie takes its viewers on a journey of how an alcoholic author plagued by writer’s block loses all control and transforms into something wild. The film was shot in wide-angle lenses, making it feel as though the viewer is there witnessing everything take place. The use of silence and building audio creates a sense of unease and dread with audiences preparing to jump out of their seats.\n\nScene That Makes You Hold Your Breath: When Danny is riding his tricycle around the hotel and the music takes an abrupt turn, he briefly encounters the murdered Grady twins before they disappear.\n\nWhat It’s About: After Annie’s (Toni Collette) mother passes away, her family experiences supernatural and demonic entities that are linked to her family’s secrets.\n\nHow It Builds Suspense Well: With evil supernatural forces at work, the question arises, do they have deeper meanings? This film is a puzzle in and of itself, which leaves viewers questioning every moment and waiting for the other shoe to drop. The eerie occurrences all have hidden agendas which come to light in a slow burn manner. You can’t quite put a finger on the answers to the burning questions, but you know that this won’t end well for the Graham family.\n\nScene That Makes You Hold Your Breath: Peter (Alex Wolff) is in charge of his little sister Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and lies to his parents in order to attend a party. While he’s smoking weed upstairs, his sister begins to have an allergic reaction to walnuts in a cake that she ate. He grabs her and begins driving them in the car to get help only to swerve when a deer is in the road. When he does so, Charlie is decapitated by a telephone pole.\n\nWhat It’s About: Four college friends reunite after the death of their friend to hike in a forest in Scandinavia. They make a wrong turn which leads them into the path of a Norse legend with an evil spirit that clings onto them.\n\nHow It Builds Suspense Well: The only goal of this film is to make it out alive. Despite each of the main characters’ flaws, the audience is found rooting for them to survive. The director prioritized character development while reminding viewers of the situation they’re in with unique plot twists. Each turn in this mysterious forest leads to an unexpected scare.\n\nScene That Makes You Hold Your Breath: When Dom is attached to a pole at a bonfire and acts as the sacrifice to Jötunn. In the minute-long moment, viewers are left wondering if someone or something will save him.\n\nWhat It’s About: Rose (Allison Williams) invites her boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) for a weekend getaway to meet her parents. Initially, Chris believes that the family is trying to overcompensate to approve of their daughter’s interracial relationship, only to uncover the family’s true motive and immoral beliefs.\n\nHow It Builds Suspense Well: The viewers recognize that something is amiss with Rose’s parents, but what exactly is wrong? After several cringy moments with the family, Rose is seen defending her boyfriend as the audience is initially led to believe it is just the parents who are unsure of how to handle their relationship. Every questionable comment and moment creates more and more questions for the audience, who is just waiting for the other shoe to drop. The giant puzzle all comes together when Chris is their next victim and he learns exactly what the Armitage family does.\n\nScene That Makes You Hold Your Breath: Chris attempts to connect with the family’s maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel). He tells her, “If there’s too many white people [somewhere] I get nervous.” She responded by tearing up while smiling before saying “no” numerous times in a row."
