        "text": "One of the best things about Halloween month (the way all mature adults refer to October) is the fact that it coincides with the official start of Cozy Season. When the leaves start to fall and Rite Aid rolls out the ghost and skeleton costumes, there’s nothing better than curling up in a blanket or 12, sipping a seasonal beverage—Pumking ale, anyone?—and freaking the living hell out of yourself with a horror movie.\n\nTo celebrate all things Halloween-adjacent, we’ve put together a master list of the very best scary (or scary-ish) movies to watch in the coming month.\n\nM3GAN (2023)\n\nNot since the early days of Jordan Peele’s Get Out fame has a horror movie embedded itself in the pop-cultural zeitgeist quite like M3GAN, as this Saturday Night Live sketch proves. Come for Allison Williams as a roboticist, stay for the weird robot-doll dancing.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video or YouTube.\n\nThe Offering (2023)\n\nOliver Park’s directorial debut is based on the Jewish folktale about the female demon Abyzou, which (believe it or not) happens to be perfect fodder for a horror film set at a Hasidic funeral home in Brooklyn.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Hulu, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nRun Rabbit Run (2023)\n\nSuccession fans will go crazy for this film, which stars Sarah Snook (a.k.a. Shiv Roy!) as a fertility doctor whose young daughter’s strange behavior hints at the reemergence of a ghost from the past.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix.\n\nTalk to Me (2023)\n\nZoe Terakes, Miranda Bird, Joe Otto, and others star in this Australian horror film about a group of friends who learn they are able to contact spirits from another realm using a mysterious embalmed hand. Good news for fans of this one: A sequel is in development.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nBodies Bodies Bodies (2022)\n\nOkay, this one is more comedy-horror than actual horror, but it’s still most definitely worth watching, if only to hear Rachel Sennott deliver the immortal line: “Your parents are UPPER. MIDDLE. CLASS.” (Plus, it was adapted from a Kristen Roupenian story, so it’s got literary cool points.)\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Paramount+, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nDon’t Worry Darling (2022)\n\nThis isn’t a horror movie, per se, but the highly scrutinized film’s much-talked-about twist most definitely classifies it as “spooky,” to say the least. Florence Pugh shines as a seemingly happy housewife whose reality is a little more, um, complicated than it initially appears in this Olivia Wilde-directed thriller that also stars Harry Styles.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Max, Netflix, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nHuesera: The Bone Woman (2022)\n\nA young woman expecting her first child is cursed by a malevolent entity in this spine-tingling Spanish-language horror film that’s honestly probably best skipped if you’re pregnant (unless it’s really, really hard to scare you).\n\nHow to watch: Stream on AMC+, Apple TV, or YouTube.\n\nThe Invitation (2022)\n\nFamily trauma is the name of the game in this horror film about a young woman who meets members of her long-lost family for the first time in the wake of her mother’s death, only to discover that they carry some pretty dark and terrifying secrets with them.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix.\n\nNope (2022)\n\nIn Jordan Peele’s neo-Western sci-fi horror film Nope, Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer star as siblings trying to prove the existence of a UFO—and if a supernatural, bloodthirsty extraterrestrial creature named “Jean Jacket” doesn’t scare you, well, hats off.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nPearl (2022)\n\nThis incredibly meme-friendly horror movie stars Mia Goth as a 1918-era young woman on the brink of madness who will stop at nothing in her pursuit of stardom.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Paramount+, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nSkinamarink (2022)\n\nThis Canadian experimental supernatural horror film follows two young children who wake up to discover that their father is missing, along with the windows and doors in their house, and it only gets scarier from there. Social media was key to getting eyeballs on this film when it first came out, although it eventually received a theatrical release.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Hulu, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nThe Night House (2021)\n\nIn a haunted house on a lake in upstate New York, a grieving widow (played by the inimitable Rebecca Hall) encounters her dead husband—and enters into a looking-glass version of her marriage that utterly unravels her. Directed by the new horror-auteur David Bruckner, this one has jump scares like you wouldn’t believe.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nSaint Maud (2021)\n\nThe story of an isolated, introverted hospice nurse played by Morfydd Clark (insanely good) who is hired to care for a once-famous dancer named Amanda (Jennifer Ehle, sexy, imperious) dying of cancer. An episode of religious ecstasy in a depleted, soggy, English seaside town spirals toward violence—and culminates in one of the best endings in recent horror.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nThe Swarm (2021)\n\nA locust breeder in southern France who happens to be a single mother is trying to raise two children and make ends meet—so why not experiment with bloodletting and insect husbandry? This supremely modern and sophisticated thriller ratchets up into vampire-locust horror, in the best way possible.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix.\n\nThe Invisible Man (2020)\n\nElisabeth Moss stars in this terrifying film about a woman who’s convinced she’s being stalked by the invisible ghost of her abusive boyfriend.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nLa Llorona (2019)\n\nDirected by Jayro Bustamante, this Guatemalan horror movie focuses on the trial of a fictional dictator on trial for a brutal genocide who starts being haunted by dark magic and ghostly apparitions of his victims until he can no longer ignore the severity of his crimes.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, or YouTube.\n\nThe Lodge (2019)\n\nA snowbound chamber piece about two kids spending a winter holiday in a cabin with their father’s mysterious new girlfriend, Grace (Riley Keough). Directed by the Austrian pair Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, The Lodge is a slow-burn genre exercise that exerts the pressure of a steel vise.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Max, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nMidsommar (2019)\n\nA bizarre Swedish death cult attempts to reel in a group of horrified American students in this psychological thriller.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Paramount+, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nReady or Not (2019)\n\nNinety minutes of hilariously grotesque mayhem. Samara Weaving plays a bride named Grace marrying into an eccentric, board game-fortune family. The wedding held at the family estate concludes with a ritualized family initiation—a deadly round of hide and seek with the family hunting Grace with guns, crossbows, axes, and the like.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV or Prime Video.\n\nUs (2019)\n\nNobody does horror like Peele, and Us—which features a family terrorized by a set of doppelgängers—is no exception.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nApostle (2018)\n\nA British horror film, set in 1905 and starring Dan Stevens and Michael Sheen, about a drifter who sets out to save his sister from a religious cult.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix.\n\nHereditary (2018)\n\nIf you’re still craving the work of Ari Aster after Midsommar, check out this 2018 horror-tragedy film in which Toni Collette truly shines.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Max, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nMalevolent (2018)\n\nFlorence Pugh stars in this horror movie about a paranormal detection racket that gets a very real assignment.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix.\n\nA Quiet Place (2018)\n\nThis post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror flick follows John Krasinski and Emily Blunt as they try to get their family through the end times.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Paramount+, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\n**What Keeps You Alive **(2018)\n\nThis Canadian psychological horror film, which premiered at SXSW and was directed by Colin Minihan, follows a young married couple celebrating their anniversary at a remote cabin whose trip…goes awry.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV or YouTube.\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nDaniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams give memorable performances in this Jordan Peele film, which will make you think twice about meeting the parents.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nA Ghost Story (2017)\n\nDavid Lowery’s supernatural drama is less a scary movie than a moving meditation on grief and the ever-shifting sands of time…but, as its title suggests, it wouldn’t be out of place in a Halloween movie marathon.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Paramount+, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nIt (2017)\n\nYou’ll never look at clowns the same way again after watching this film.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Apple TV, Max, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nRaw (2016)\n\nNot for the faint of heart is Julia Ducournau’s coming-of-age horror film about a young vegetarian veterinary student who begins to crave the taste of flesh after trying meat for the first time, but if you have a strong stomach (or are willing to close your eyes at certain key
