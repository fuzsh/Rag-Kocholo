I assumed the man was insane and confused. He couldn’t remember even killing his family until later in the movie. It would make sense if he killed them, left the house and then forgot the murders only to return to it.\n\nAs far as the basement, yes, he buried them there from what I could tell. I don’t think the barn had shit to do with it other than to creep out the audience.\n\nI don’t expect much from “scary movies” anymore. The last really good one to me was The Ring and The Grudge. Everything before that for years was weak.\n\nHey Prof X thanks!\n\nBut do you remember the guy who tried to buy the farm? The crazy killer guy met him too… or maybe I am confused and that guy showed up just checking up on things when he went psycho.\n\nYes horror movies today suck. I liked them better without all the gore.\n\nLoved Eyes of Laura Mars, When a Stranger Calls, even The Howling\n\n[quote]Professor X wrote:\n\nOctoberGirl wrote:\n\nAnd what was up with the basement floor?

That’s why he kept showing up. The director stated that he threw him in as a red herring so everyone would think he would be a part of the twist at the end. He wasn’t.\n\nAs far as good scary movies, there have been more. I just don’t think that people should really expect to “afraid” much anymore because we are desensitized to them.\n\nOne of my favorites is Event Horizon. I’ve seen that enough times to be able to quote scenes. The Dawn of The Dead remake was great too. I liked just about every scene it. The first Resident Evil is also classic."
