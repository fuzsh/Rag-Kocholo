        "text": "Kristen Stewart dodges ghosts and all sorts of make-believe horrors in the Pang brothers' fright flick \"The Messengers,\" opening today.\n\nAnd, as usual in Hollywood, most of it looks scary but is actually harmless -- a woman in creepy makeup played the main ghost, for example.\n\nBut then there was that scene in which Stewart is covered in mud and beetles, maggots and Madagascar cockroaches.\n\n\"That's me!\" the 16-year-old actress says. \"And it wasn't even scripted or anything. That's one of the cool things about working with the Pangs -- you'd go into work and you'd really have no idea what you were going to do that day.\"\n\nThe young actress stars as Jess, a teen who's relocated with her parents (Penelope Ann Miller and Dylan McDermott) and her toddler brother (Evan and Theo Turner) from bustling Chicago to an isolated farm in North Dakota.\n\nApparitions begin to reach out to Jess and her brother, but only they can see them, and Mom and Dad laugh off their daughter's outlandish claims that the ghastly poltergeists have something to do with the family that previously lived in the house.\n\nSpeaking from her Los Angeles home, Stewart describes Jess as a typical teen to whom audiences will relate. \"There's a lot of animosity, especially in the beginning of the movie, between her and her parents,\" the actress says. \"That's one of the things that motivated them to move out to the farm where they live. She's a sweet girl and very misunderstood.\n\n\"They think that she's being very difficult and really trying to make things hard for everyone, and even hurting herself on purpose, but that's not what she's doing. She'd love for the family to be happy and have an easy life together, but they just don't.\"\n\nStewart -- who has already completed three other films, including the romantic comedy \"In the Land of Women\" and the Sean Penn-directed drama \"Into the Wild\" -- concedes that \"The Messengers\" will enter a marketplace that of late has been flooded with Asian or Asian-inspired, PG-13-rated horror films. But she believes that, if audiences give \"The Messengers\" a chance, it will deliver the goods.\n\n\"I think it's pretty scary,\" she says. \"In all honesty, it is very much like all those other movies, but this one actually has a story that you can get invested in and a family dynamic that you can really get involved with. So, when these people are put in danger, you actually care. Hopefully, people will care.\""
