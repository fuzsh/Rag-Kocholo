        "text": "The horror genre has taken us many strange places throughout its course, going everywhere from haunted houses to monster-filled dystopias, populating their realms with zombies, with vampires and werewolves, with paranormal entities. But what about the sea? And what about the animal—the one who quietly but fiercely roams as we blissfully paddle away—we fear most from the sea? One of the strangely prolific sub-genres of horror over the years has been shark movies, a brand of cinematic storytelling that has persisted since Jaws popularized the creature on the big screen back in 1975... despite most of the movies in this sub-genre being, well, quite bad. But there happens to be a handful of shark movies that many people would agree stand above the rest—with quite a few more falling into the “so bad it’s good” category. It’s a style of storytelling that both takes itself very seriously, yet likes to have fun and remain self-aware. So which shark movies are quintessential for this storied sub-genre?\n\nThis article will serve as your guide to that question. I’ll review the history of shark movies and the strange allure they present, the cinematic tales that are based on terrifying true stories and, ultimately, which films about the ocean’s ultimate beast are the absolute best. If you love sharks, or if you want to know more about shark movies, or if you wanted to be scared beyond your wits by this odd sub-genre, then get ready.\n\nTop Shark Movies\n\nWhen confronted with compiling such a list, one must ask: why are there so many shark movies in the first place? Well, it seems few creatures on the face of this earth inspire more fear than the sharp-toothed predators who salivate at the sight (and smell) of blood. Other creatures, like snakes and crocodiles, have produced their own sub-genres within horror, but none have produced as many movies as sharks. Unfortunately, with such an influx of films—especially low-budget films that often try too hard to give off a “campy” feel—this means many shark movies are of low quality, leaving little room for a list to house high quality shark pictures.\n\nMost shark movies, aiming to capitalize on the near-universal fear inspired by the animal, unsurprisingly fall into the horror or thriller category. There are plenty of comedies, however, from tongue-in-cheek spectacles like The Meg and Sharknado, or animated ventures like The Bad Guys and Shark Tale. There are also plenty of documentaries to choose from, as the obsession with capturing the fear invoked by sharks has spurned a number of great stories that aim to defend sharks and showcase how their habitat has been encroached upon by the true “monsters,” human beings.\n\nIf you count Finding Nemo as a shark movie (personally, I do not), then the Pixar films owns the highest grossing total for shark flick ever with a worldwide gross of $947 million. But when we account for inflation, there’s no denying that Jaws, the movie that started the blockbuster craze in the United States, is the top dog, with its lifetime adjusted domestic gross standing at a whopping $1.172 billion—the seventh-highest total ever, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nNow we move onto the top shark movies list. For the record, these rankings are purely based upon my personal opinion. However, because the bar has been set so low for shark movies, I would argue that most movie critics who have seen lots of shark movies would agree that these ten notably stand above the rest.\n\n10. The Reef (2010)\n\nYou can’t but help be impressed by the sort of marketing done to promote The Reef. Director Andrew Traucki’s main goal was to create an honest-to-life shark experience on the big screen, opting to use real shark footage over CGI technology. The production team shot scenes with live sharks in South Australia, and streamed the footage live online as they did it. \"This kind of marketing strategy is absolutely vital,” Traucki says about a film that, true to its approach, makes you feel like you’re part of a real shark attack. And, as you’ll see several times on this list, the movie sure enough was based on the true story of Ray Boundy, the sole survivor of a 1983 shark attack. After a yacht capsizes off the coast of Australia, a group of friends tries to swim to safety, only to learn they’re being tracked by a great white shark. The cast, including Damian Walshe-Howling, Gyton Grantley and Zoe Naylor, delivers performances that feel startlingly, almost uncomfortably, legitimate. The Reef was a hit with critics, who appreciated the realistic depiction and relished in its suspenseful atmosphere.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Reef.\n\n9. Open Water (2003)\n\nWant to create a truly authentic shark movie experience? Then throw the actors in with real sharks. I’m not kidding. In a move that opted for sheer authenticity, Open Water director Chris Kentis sent stars Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis in with the sea creatures, with shark handlers and various measures employed to ensure safety. Still, you can see the genuine fear on the actor’s faces throughout. Open Water centers on Susan and Daniel, a couple left behind in shark-infested waters during a scuba diving trip. As the hours wear on, the sharks begin to circle—leaving their future in jeopardy. The film is based on the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonerga, who were stranded at sea during a scuba diving expedition. There was a massive search for the two, but they were never found. This minimalist thriller won over critics, who praised the film for its suspenseful and realistic portrayal of survival horror. Its nothing-but-the-essentials approach made for an effective use of tension, making Open Water a rare shark film that doesn’t feel outlandish or cartoonish, but instead frighteningly palpable.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Open Water.\n\n8. The Meg (2018)\n\nThera are several movies on this list that aim for authenticity, that attempt to recreate real shark attacks on the big screen. Then there are movies famous for the changes they made to genre filmmaking. Others are documentaries that are notable for raising awareness about sharks and their habitats. Then...there’s The Meg. I know this movie isn’t for everyone, but if you’re looking for some sci-fi elements to be mixed into your shark story, if you’re hoping for something ridiculous—preposterous, even—then let Jason Statham be your guide. The action star plays Jonas Taylor, a rescue diver who encounters a massive prehistoric shark known as the “Megalodon.” When the creature resurfaces years later, he’s called to confront it once more. Directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Li Bingbing, Rainn Wilson and Ruby Rose, The Meg got mixed reviews from critics, who appreciated the fun, over-the-top atmosphere, but ultimately found it lacked depth and originality. While there may be truth to those criticisms, it doesn’t stop the film from being a heck of a time.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Meg.\n\n7. Kon-Tiki (2012)\n\nIn 1947, Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl set out on an expedition to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages and connect disparate cultures. Sailing from Perus to the Polynesian islands on a raft made from balsa wood, Heyerdahl and his crew traveled 4,300 miles in 101 days. And, obviously, this trip included confrontations with sharks, which in turn became a major component of the journey’s filmic adaptation. Kon-Tiki, starring Pål Sverre Hagen as Thor Heyerdahl and directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, sparked controversy because of the liberties it took with the real story, such as one specific scene where an expedition member was attacked by a shark (which never happened in real life). Still, with a stellar 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie was a hit with critics back in 2012, with writers praising the movie’s breathtaking visuals and epic storytelling. To boot, the Academy Awards nominated the movie for Best Foreign Language Film. So while Kon-Tiki isn’t a “shark movie” per se, the sea creatures are a big enough part of the story that you can enjoy some classic shark elements while consuming the much grander story.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Kon-Tiki.\n\n6. 47 Meters Down (2017)\n\nOf all the movies on this list, 47 Meters Down is the one that might be too much for some people to handle. This tense thriller, directed by Johannes Roberts, follows two sisters, Lisa and Kate (Mandy Moore and Claire Holt), who decide to go cage diving amongst a pool of sharks while vacationing in Mexico. But their fun adventure turns into an absolute nightmare when the cage breaks free and plunges into the ocean, leaving them trapped at the bottom with only an hour’s worth of oxygen. To survive, they must travel half a football field’s length back up to the surface. Despite how scarily real everything feels in 47 Meters Down, the film is not based on a true story. Critics weren’t overly impressed with the movie, as they praised the performances and taught tension, but ultimately felt the characters were underdeveloped and paper-thin. Personally, I think that’s the point—the film’s chief aim is to immerse you in the most unfathomable situation possible. So 47 Meters Down gets a full recommendation for anyone (like me) who likes getting their pants scared off.\n\nHere’s where you can stream 47 Meters Down.\n\n5. Sharkwater (2006)\n\nOn Jan. 31, 2017, filmmaker Rob Stewart disappeared during a scuba dive he performed while filming Sharkwater Extinction, the sequel to his famous first documentary. However, at some point, Stewart vanished beneath the waves, and his body was found three days later—a tragic moment for a man who spent his career changing a negative public perception of sharks created by the kinds of movies you’ll find on this list. And his most important contribution to that cause was the renowned documentary Sharkwater. In this important film, Stewart embarks on a dangerous journey to expose the illegal practices that threaten the apex predators. This documentary combines breathtaking underwater footage with a compelling narrative about the stark reality sharks face in our cruel, morally compromised waters. Given its intense and uncompromising mission, Sharkwater was unsurprisingly met with critical acclaim, with Stewart’s legacy forever solidified as one of the shark species’ most important and outspoken voices.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Sharkwater.\n\n4. Deep Blue Sea (1999)\n\nThe gigantic great white shark that prowls the waters of Jaws was famously 25 feet long. So what did director Renny Harlin do for his shark in Deep Blue Sea? He made it 26 feet long, of course. And that one little fact exemplifies everything you should expect when watching Deep Blue Sea—they are going for it. Harlin, who directed movies like Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2, wanted nothing more than to create the ultimate shark blockbuster in 1999, and he did one heck of a job. Powered by an all-star cast that includes Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson, this highly-ridiculous-yet-highly-entertaining shark movie follows a research team that’s studying genetically engineered sharks in an underwater facility. Unfortunately, they made the sharks too smart for their own good—and now the sea creatures are looking to punish everybody. Receiving mostly positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its action and surprising twists, Deep Blue Sea has become a cult hit, and is often considered the second-best shark movie ever behind Jaws.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Deep Blue Sea.\n\n3. The Shallows (2016)\n\nIn 2010, Ryan Reynolds starred in the movie Buried, in which he remained trapped inside a coffin the entire time. Inspired by such a bold acting choice, his wife Blake Lively wanted to commit herself to a minimalist experience that would require a similar set of acting skills. The resulting film, then, was The Shallows, a survival thriller about a surfer who becomes stranded on a rock 200 yards from shore after being attacked by a great white shark. With limited resources and a rising tide, Nancy (played by Lively) much use her wits and determination to make it back to safety. This film isn’t based on a true story, but was a huge hit with critics, largely thanks to the movie’s stunning cinematography that creates a sense of terror and alienation, as well as Lively’s convincing performance of what might be the most terrifying situation imaginable. Movies can be great for lots of different reasons, but, personally, I can’t help but fall for a movie that’s this terrifying. It’s truly remarkable. If you’re looking to be scared half to death by your shark movies, then many people would agree: The Shallows is about as scary as it gets.\n\nHere’s where you can stream The Shallows.\n\n2. Playing With Sharks (2021)\n\nSince 1975, Jaws has been considered, by all accounts, the most quintessential shark movie... in the fictional context. But there’s another movie that is resoundingly acclaimed as the greatest shark documentary of all time—and it came out just three years ago. Backed by a stellar 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Playing With Sharks follows the life and career of diver and filmmaker Valerie Taylor, whose groundbreaking work in shark conservation, along with her efforts to change the public perception of these misunderstood creatures, was immortalized on screen by director Sally Aitken. This documentary uses archival footage and personal anecdotes to showcase Taylor’s fearless approach to underwater exploration, her dedication to protecting marine life, her ruthless persistence to changing the grand shark narrative. Critics universally praised Playing With Sharks, which painted an engaging narrative that both informed with its observations about shark culture and entertained through Taylor’s vibrant life and career. If you’re looking for a great shark documentary, then Play With Sharks has to be your top pick.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Playing With Sharks.\n\n1. Jaws (1975)\n\nIs there any real surprise here? At the end of the day, when it’s all said and done, once we look back at every shark movie ever made, everything will inevitably trace back to the shark flick that started the entire cultural phenomenon: Jaws. This Steven Spielberg movie is the ultimate cinematic experience when it comes to sharks, noted for kickstarting the age of blockbuster entertainment through the director’s timeless stylistic approach to narrative. The film stars Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw as three men hunting a massive great white shark that’s terrorizing a small coastal town. The movie’s plot is truly that simple, with man tracking and attempting to outsmart beast, but it’s also stuffed to the brim with greatness in so many other ways, from John Williams’ iconic score to an incredible script that’s filled with classic lines like, “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” Critics emphatically lauded this loosely-based-on-real-events movie, which won three Academy Awards for editing, score and sound (it lost the Best Picture category to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), cementing its status as a movie that’s more than a shark movie—it’s a landmark experience that initiated the age of the blockbuster in Hollywood.\n\nHere’s where you can stream Jaws.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf you’re looking for the best and absolutely most essential shark movies available, then this list will serve as your guide. From terrifying true stories to electric documentaries to timeless blockbusters, these are the shark movies you do not want to miss."
