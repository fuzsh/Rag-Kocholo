        "text": "Looking for the best scary movies? You’re in luck. Many of the most creative, brilliantly original movies made today are horror movies, but that’s not to knock what came before them. (Spoken with a loving side eye toward our pals who think movies that came out before ~1980 can’t actually be that scary.)\n\nWhether you’re seeking new scary movies or the best horror movies of all time, we've assembled a movie marathon that will have suspense and horror fans shrieking with shock and delight. Ready to be kept on the edge of your seat — or wrapped tightly in a blanket — for the next couple hours? (Because the scares obviously end when the movie does, and we for one have never slept with the lights on after watching any of these.) Ahead, discover the scariest films ever made, including '90s slashers, psychological thrillers, Halloween movies, plenty of old-school classics, and the best horror features that will haunt you for ages.\n\n1. The Exorcist (1973)\n\nThink of all the exorcism and possession movies that have been made in the years since The Exorcist’s debut. It was literally the OG of demonic films. That scene when the little girl’s head makes a full 360-degree turn? That’s a whole lot of nope. Also, the fact that it was supposedly based on a true story makes it that much scarier.\n\n2. The Babadook (2014)\n\nHave you ever been afraid of a picture book before? No? Well, you will be after finishing this film. The Babadook follows a single mother and her son as they come across a terrifying children’s book with a sinister rhyme. You’ll never look at a coat rack the same way again.\n\n3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nNancy and her boyfriend Glen are trying to get the bottom of an insane situation: A group of suburban teens are being hunted down one by one in their dreams by a demon. And if he catches them in their fantasies? They die in reality. Can they stop the nightmare once and for all?\n\n4. Under the Shadow (2016)\n\nFrom Iranian-born writer and director Babak Anvari, Under the Shadow is capital-G Good stuff, for a horror movie and for a movie period. The whole thing is in Persian and takes place during the Iran-Iraq war, telling the story of a mother, her young daughter, and an evil, supernatural force that’s taken up residence within their war-torn apartment building — and, it seems, within the daughter, too. With plenty of genuinely eerie, original, and seat-jumping moments, you might be grateful to have the subtitles to focus on.\n\n5. Halloween (1978)\n\nWe can’t talk about good scary movies without mentioning Halloween. As the granddaddy of all the Michael Myers movies, Halloween is also one of the scariest in the franchise. That mask was the star of our nightmares as kids and we still get scared every time that movie comes on TV.\n\n6. It Follows (2014)\n\nOne of the best horror films of recent years, this movie is exhilaratingly creepy. It Follows a slow burn — by that, we also mean that the “it” doing the following is famously slow-moving — but that’s part of what makes the story so genuinely terrifying. Throughout, there’s a sense of true, doom-filled inescapability; that no matter where our teen protagonists run, the monster will eventually catch up with them. People sometimes refer to the plot as an analogy for STIs or for surviving sexual violence, and we get why they do — the movie’s monster is transferred to its next target via sex. But regardless of how you interpret it, It Follows is sure to serve up some serious, and seriously creative, scares.\n\n7. The Hills Have Eyes (2005)\n\nBoth the 2006 and 1977 versions of The Hills Have Eyes are totally worth watching, and they’ll both leave you pretty terrified. The film follows the Carter family as they are driving through the southwest portion of the U.S. When their car breaks down, they become the victims of a group of people who aim to torture them.\n\n10. Get Out (2017)\n\nYou had to know this one was coming. Jordan Peele’s Get Out made an instant, genre-changing hit out of a story that needed, and still needs, to be told: the horrors of white liberalism. In his Oscar-winning directorial debut, Peele peeled back the curtain on “progressive” whiteness, offering a necessary critique on everything from the pitfalls of white feminism to the kinds of racist, anti-Black microaggressions that still run rampant. Plus, it just hit all the right scary movie notes. We’re pretty sure Get Out will stay on our list of most iconic horror movies for decades to come.\n\n11. The Blair Witch Project (1999)\n\nThe Blair Witch Project earns a space towards the end of this list solely for being SO scary during its time. This was before “found footage” movies became popular, so it really felt like we were watching something that had really taken place. Plus, who can forget that ending scene?!\n\n14. Paranormal Activity (2009)\n\nOkay, so technically this is like a zillion movies, but the Paranormal Activity films are pretty terrifying, namely numbers 1 and 3. The first Paranormal Activity movie was probably so scary because it was the first of its kind, and we’re still not over the last ten minutes of the third installment. Also, that scene when all the kitchen furniture suddenly appeared on the ceiling? Yeah, we’d burn the haunted house down if that happened to us.\n\n15. Boxing Helena (1993)\n\nSoon after the stunningly beautiful Helena refuses the advances of an obsessed surgeon, she gets into a car accident near his home. The evil doctor then abducts her and keeps her captive in his home, Misery-style, eventually amputating her limbs one by one. In the words of Alison Nastasi, Jennifer Chambers Lynch “created the strangest fairy tale of the ‘90s.”\n\n24. A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night (2014)\n\nTouted as “the first Iranian Vampire Western,” A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night takes place in an abandoned city that is haunted by a vampire. Shot in black-and-white, it contains a lot of frightening imagery that is definitely what nightmares are made of. It was shown at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and was later adapted into a graphic novel.\n\n25. The Nightmare (2015)\n\nThe Nightmare is actually a documentary, but is just as creepy as any fictional thriller on this list. The film focuses on eight people who suffer from sleep paralysis – a condition that results in the inability to move, speak, or react when falling asleep or waking up. Sometimes, this condition also brings hallucinations and frightening visions. Documentary though it may be, it’s still reputed as one of the scariest movies of all time.\n\n32. Gerald's Game (2017)\n\nGerald and his wife head to a remote lake house for a weekend away. He handcuffs her to the bed in preparation for a kinky game, but things take a dark turn when he has a heart attack and Jessie is left with no way to escape her restraints. She can't reach the keys, Gerald can't help her, and she starts seeing apparitions which may or may not be real. Gerald's Game is a Netflix production based on a book by Stephen King, which in and of itself is a good indication the movie is absolutely terrifying.\n\n33. The Conjuring (2013)\n\nThere is no way anyone can watch this movie without having nightmares. Also based on a true story, The Conjuring focuses on real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren as they inspect a home possessed by a dark force. Between that creepy Annabelle doll and the even scarier demon that lurks at the family’s house, we’re pretty sure the lights are staying on for months after watching this one. (P.S. You can actually visit Ed and Lorraine’s creepy occult museum to see Annabelle IRL if you’re into torturing yourself like that.)\n\n40. Candyman (1992, 2021)\n\nCandyman, about a Black man who was horrifically murdered for his relationship with a white woman and who now haunts Chicago’s notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects, has a cult following — but not one without its complications, especially for Black moviegoers. It’s not always clear if the movie is critiquing white saviorism or asking audiences to identify with its white savior-y lead, a “well-intentioned” white academic who investigates the Candyman legend (and leaves a lot of harm in her wake). Either way, for a movie that’s supposedly about the Black experience of public housing, it spends a lot of time telling a white woman’s story. The 2021 sequel, featuring Jordan Peele and Nia DaCosta as writers and DaCosta as director — making her the first Black woman to direct a horror movie from a major studio — moved to correct that.\n\n41. I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)\n\nA group of teens commits murder and hides the evidence—but someone knows what they did as is out to make them pay. This scary movie has some of the best stars of the '90s, including Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., Ryan Phillippe, and Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\n42. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998)\n\nThe bad news: The killer from I Know What You Did Last Summer still knows what everyone did last summer, and he's back for more blood. The good news: This sequel is almost as good as the original.\n\n43. Hellraiser (1987)\n\n“It’s the best movie ever,” says my roommate. If that’s not enough of an argument to sway you, know that Hellraiser is one of those underrated horror movies that is increasingly currying favor today as a low-budget cult classic. The whole franchise is based on a short story written by the same dude behind Candyman, and it features an evil villain, Pinhead, who’s more complex than some other slasher scions. The costumes and makeup are a whole mood, and the story itself, about pain and pleasure, is decidedly dark. Press play if you’re into gore, and hit skip on this one if you aren’t.\n\n58. Ringu (1998)\n\nRingu is the original Japanese version of The Ring. And yeah, we are still traumatized from that shot of Samara climbing out of the well and through the TV at the end of The Ring but believe it or not, the Japanese version is even scarier. You’re welcome.\n\n59. Prevenge (2016)\n\nAlice Lowe directs and stars in this original comedy-horror film about a pregnant woman on a killing spree, under the mind control of her unborn fetus who seeks to avenge its father’s death.\n\n60. When a Stranger Calls (1979)\n\nThe tagline of this movie was “every babysitter’s nightmare becomes real,” which is why we’re pretty sure you shouldn’t watch this if you have any upcoming nighttime child-care gigs booked. In it, a high school student gets some disturbing phone calls while babysitting, and we won’t spoil the twist for you if you’ve somehow escaped knowledge of it. What we will end with is saying that the original is a cult classic for a reason; you can skip the 2006 Camilla Belle remake.\n\n67. Night of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nLike zombie movies? Then you should definitely give this George A. Romero-directed horror classic — credited as the first modern zombie movie — a whirl. It did the whole rag-tag-group-defends-itself-from-flesh-eaters shtick first. And it also did that while pushing the horror movie genre forward in more ways than one; in his Night of the Living Dead role, Duane Jones became one of the first Black actors to have a lead role in a mainstream horror movie.\n\n68. La Llorona (2019)\n\nLa Llorona is a Guatemalan horror movie that uses a popular Latin American legend of the same name — about a ghostly figure who drowned her children and haunts waterways — to tell a story about indigenous genocide, gender, and class. In other words: Yes, this movie is making a (worthwhile) point, but even if it wasn’t, it’s got enough chills and scares to be worth watching."
