He contorts his body, moans, and in one scene his face melts off and a skinless arm emerges out of his mouth to attempt to strangle a woman. This is all meant to be funny, but it's also creepy. People, including teenagers, are threatened by men with guns. A man shoots at a family and attacks them with household objects. A car chase results in several cars crashing. Police officers point guns at teenagers, and CIA operatives shoot tasers at and conduct tests on the ghost. A man and a woman both fall out of house windows. People get thrown around by the ghost. A woman says she'd rather swallow razor blades than give someone some information they're asking for. A man is killed and buried.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nPositive Role Models\n\nsome\n\nKevin shows great compassion for Ernest, selflessly working to help him uncover his past and \"cross over.\" Ernest also stands up for and defends Kevin. Kevin's brother and even his dad Frank push him around and tease him. Frank has run through a series of get-rich-quick schemes, disappointing his family, but he's a loving father and husband. Kevin's mom also stands up for her sons. Joy is a stellar student who's unafraid of her peers. Characters break laws and wreak havoc in pursuit of their goals. Leslie does the right thing. People jump on bandwagon trends and can get carried away.\n\nParents need to know that We Have a Ghost is a dramatic comedy about a Black family that moves into a house and discovers it's haunted by an older White man, played by David Harbour. The teenage son, Kevin (Jahi Di'Allo Winston), befriends the ghost and shows compassion in trying to help him figure out how he died so he can \"cross over.\" The ghost isn't scary, but sometimes he purposely tries to scare the living. These scenes can get creepy, like when the ghost contorts his body, melts his face, or tries to strangle a woman with a skinless arm that emerges from inside his mouth. Meanwhile, living adults, including police officers and CIA operatives, chase, threaten, shoot at, and try to capture or kill the ghosts and others, including teenagers. Violence involves guns, tasers, car chases, car crashes, people getting knocked over and hit over the head, and a man who is killed and buried. One man appears drunk, and another is said to have been a heavy drinker. Language includes \"f--k,\" \"s--t,\" \"a--hole,\" \"bitch,\" \"douchebag,\" \"d--k,\" and more. Teen kissing and references to \"getting laid,\" strippers, boners, and dry humping. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails."
