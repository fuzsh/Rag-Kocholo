        "text": "If horror is your preferred literary genre, then you’ve come to the right place. It’s certainly one of mine, as I’ve spent a truly mind-boggling amount of hours reading well into the pitch-black night about chestnut-obsessed serial killers, massive (and massively haunted) homes, and monstrous creatures lurking in the desert. But of all the scary stories I’ve been possessed by while feeling gallons of adrenaline coursing through my system with each turn of the page, a few stand out as being particularly messed up.\n\nLike, royally fucked up books. The ones that are so gruesome, so bafflingly freaky, that they’ve taken up permanent real estate in my brain over the years. So, from a doomed trip to meet the parents, to a haunted IKEA — yes, I said “a haunted IKEA” — may I present the most disturbing books I’ve had the (unfortunate) (but also fortunate?) (I need therapy) pleasure of reading.\n\n10. I’m Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid\n\nLet’s start off light, shall we? (And hopefully, by describing this odd, freaky little book as “light,” it should give you an indication of what to expect from the rest of this list.) Iain Reid’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things is short and weird. I can’t even properly explain how very weird, and deeply, deeply unnerving this book about a couple’s trip out to the country to meet his parents is without giving away key pieces of the plot. But I’ll just say that when news that this book was being adapted into a Netflix film started floating around the internet a few years back, I decided to give it a go, and I’m so glad I did. It’s trippy and disorienting in an A24 movie kind of way, if that’s at all your vibe.\n\n9. Cabin at the End of the World by Paul G. Tremblay\n\nOne of my favorite things about the horror genre is how it’s able to distill core themes about our everyday lives – good vs. evil, inclusion vs. exclusion, emotion vs. reason — into scenarios so terrifying that it doesn’t feel like a lesson being preached at you from a pulpit on high. Instead, it feels like an important message wrapped inside entertaining, thought-provoking nightmare upon nightmare with a scarred-for-life-flavored cherry on top. What more could you want in a book, honestly?\n\nThat is very much the vibe of Paul Tremblay’s Cabin at the End of the World, which mashes together a violent home invasion with a looming apocalypse. It introduces 7-year-old Wen and her fathers, Eric and Andrew, who are taking a family vacation at their remote New Hampshire cabin. With no cell service and the closest neighbors over two miles down the road, it’s a city-dweller’s unplugged paradise . . . up until a group of eerie strangers appear on their doorstep, triggering a grisly confrontation and a heaping amount of “what the fuck?!”\n\nIt’s not so much gory as existentially upsetting — the decisions Andrew and Eric are forced to grapple with are so bleak it immediately hooked its claws into my psyche. For weeks after I finished this one, I’d find myself staring into space just wondering about the characters and their fates and the why of it all.\n\n8. Horrorstör by Grady Hendrix\n\nOn the surface, the fact that I’ve been so traumatized by a book about a haunted IKEA knock-off feels . . . well, embarrassing. I can’t lie. But this is Grady Hendrix we’re talking about — author of the excellent My Best Friend’s Exorcism, The Southern Book Club’s Guide For Slaying Vampires, and more — who mixes pulp and camp into his horror like the best of ‘em. Horrorstör is a comment on capitalism, sure, but it’s also just a really, really good and inventive twist on the classic haunted house story.\n\nWhen a group of employees are forced to work a nine-hour dusk-till-dawn shift at the ORSK furniture superstore in Cleveland in an attempt to catch whoever’s been vandalizing merchandise overnight, they encounter far worse things than teenagers knocking over Kjerring bookshelves or shattering Glans water goblets. It’s an evening of pure, undiluted terror, brought to life with Hendrix’s descriptive language and deranged imagination. I haven’t been able to scrub certain visuals from my brain since reading (and I also haven’t stepped foot in an IKEA, either).\n\nAlso, pro-tip: if you do decide to grab this book, absolutely spring for the physical copy!!! It’s designed to look like a real-life IKEA manual, from the French flaps inside the covers to furniture design drawings scattered throughout (that get more and more sinister the deeper you get into the story). So, so cool.\n\n7. The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes\n\nIf you’ve attempted to watch the Apple+ adaptation of The Shining Girls and it didn’t click with you, please still give the novel a try — if you want to be freaked the fuck out, of course. Per the publisher, here’s the synopsis (because I’m lazy):\n\n“In Depression-era Chicago, Harper Curtis finds a key to a house that opens on to other times. But it comes at a cost. He has to kill the shining girls: bright young women, burning with potential. Curtis stalks them through their lives across different eras until, in 1989, one of his victims, Kirby Mazrachi, survives and starts hunting him back. Working with a former homicide reporter who is falling for her, Kirby races against time and reason to unravel an impossible mystery.”\n\nThis is a book that, as a woman, punched me directly in the gut. There’s graphic violence and gore throughout (a brutal scene involving a dog — the worst horror trope— had me in tears), but what really stuck with me was the notion that, across time women have never been, and are still unable to, escape the men who want to hurt us. No matter how smart, inventive, beautiful, courageous, and/or [insert literally any other adjective here] we are. It’s this endless cycle that goes on and on and on. That’s what disturbed me about this one.\n\n5. Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage and The Push by Ashley Audrain\n\nWhen we talk about “evil kids” in horror, The Omen, Pet Sematary, or The Exorcist might come to mind. These novels by Zoje Stage and Ashley Audrain are more in the vein of We Need to Talk About Kevin, with no supernatural elements to be found. In the case of Baby Teeth, Hanna, one of the evil kids in question, is just cruel down to her bones without any demonic possession to rely on as an excuse. While her father and pretty much everyone else she meets view the silent 7-year-old as a little angel, her mother Suzette is the target of Hanna’s twisted, increasingly sinister games. The Push has a very similar plot, again focusing on a woman whose daughter very clearly seems to want to kill her (as well as her baby brother). With their health and sanity waning by the day, each of the mothers in these stories start to fear that their seemingly innocent daughters are anything but, resulting in a battle of wills that pushes familial bonds to their breaking points.\n\nBoth are tense AF, and great, messed-up looks at parenthood and everything that can go wrong that should leave any new or expectant moms and dads a little shaken. (You can take my word for it, since I read The Push while pregnant with my own daughter, and it kept me up at night.) There’s no guarantee to parenting — the idea that the little human beings we grow and raise and pour love into will not end up perfect isn’t a new concept by any means, but this story explores the worst case scenario to chilling effect.\n\n4. The Raft by Stephen King\n\nThis one features in Stephen King’s 1985 short story collection, Skeleton Crew (after first making an appearance as a booklet included with Gallery in 1982). While I’ve read most of King’s big horror hits — It, The Stand, The Shining, Salem’s Lot, etc. — it’s funny which of his titles have actually succeeded in spooking me as well as being good stories. Later, one of his recent books, is another that surprised me with how much it affected me. But back to The Raft, which I read for the first time when I was 10 or 11-years-old (and likely explains why I found it so freaky — sue me!!!!).\n\nThe set-up, on its face, is honestly kind of silly, similar to Horrorstör — a pair of college-aged couples decide to go swimming in a random pond hidden off the side of a road, but discover they can’t leave the raft in the middle of it without risking getting eaten (absorbed?) by a malevolent blob of an oil slick that shoots through the water after them. A blob!!! I swear, though, King manages to make this blob nearly as scary as the shark in Peter Benchley’s Jaws.\n\nThere are a lot of issues with this story, especially its problematic depictions of women (an issue a lot of King’s work suffers from, if we’re being honest). But if you can get past that, it’s a rite of passage tale (another King calling card) incorporating themes of the pitfalls of entering adulthood (and maybe even the ferocity of nature) that is just horrifying to read. Seriously gruesome.\n\n3. The Troop by Nick Cutter and The Deep by Nick Cutter\n\nThe funny thing about Nick Cutter is, you can be marveling over his beautifully-bleak observations about the human condition, or the phenomenal way he puts together sentences, and then a page later you’re considering throwing your book across the room rather than finish reading one of the grossest, goriest scenes you’ve ever encountered. So yeah, The Troop and The Deep are a RIDE.\n\nIn the former, Cutter’s horror novel drops us onto a small, remote island off the coast of Canada, where a Boy Scout troop and their lone adult leader have been left to fend for themselves for the weekend. It’s supposed to be a fun-filled few days of survival techniques and bonding and whatever else you do when you don’t have your phone or Wi-Fi. Unfortunately for everyone involved, a mysterious visitor infected with something sinister washes up on shore, and things go downhill, fast. Way downhill. Like, down the hill and straight to the darkest pits of hell. (There’s one scene involving a turtle that I absolutely could not read. It was that disgusting and disturbing.)\n\nThe Deep is far more f*cked up, in my opinion. In fact I actually wasn’t able to even finish it, which almost never happens. I loathe not finishing a book. And as such I very rarely do so, unless things are truly dire, which ended up being the case with Cutter’s 2015 novel when I realized things were very obviously leading to another brutal animal death. For what it’s worth, The Deep has been hailed as the perfect mix of The Abyss and The Shining, and I was genuinely excited to ~dive~ into this one (el oh el) at first. I enjoyed what I read for the most part (I got to around 65 percent), especially how successful Cutter is at creating such an intensely claustrophobic sense of terror as the main character enters an isolated underwater lab down in the Mariana Trench. So, if you’re made of stronger stuff than I am, I actually would still recommend it. What I’d read up until that point was freaky as hell, and had set up some really interesting (and potentially supernatural?) twists and turns to come. Alas!\n\n2. Devolution by Max Brooks\n\n“How can anyone possibly be scared of Bigfoot,” I wondered innocently as I bought Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Rainier Sasquatch Massacre. “What’s so scary about an overgrown ape?” Well, as it turns out, A LOT OF THINGS. While reading detailed descriptions about violently mutilated corpses is gross, sure, what really stuck with me about this novel from World War Z author Max Brooks (and gave me two nights-worth of nightmares) is the genuinely spine-tingling feeling of being hunted. Of being watched. Of being prey. It’s not something we, as humans, experience all that often, right? Here, through the main character’s journal entries, we look through the eyes of the gazelle about to become lunch for a lion (only, the gazelle is a bunch of spoiled rich people and the lion is a giant, mythical creature that smells like rotten eggs). Unexpectedly excellent.\n\n1. Tender Is the Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica\n\nYeah, so Tender Is the Flesh is — without a doubt — the most disturbing book I’ve ever read, but I can also see why it’s gotten so much acclaim. I loved it AND it made me sick. (For real, though — I became a vegetarian for about three months after reading it, el oh el).\n\nSo, the rundown: an infectious virus has made all animal meat poisonous to humans, so instead of everyone deciding to forgo eating meat, the government initiates the “transition,” aka eating human meat—“special meat”— is now legal. (cue gags) Marcos, a meat factory exec, leads us through this nauseating new world, showing us how the sausage gets made in truly disgusting detail. Things take a horrifying shift when he’s given a “gift” of a live female specimen from a coworker, forcing him to confront his own morals. Is he better than his friends and family who gleefully accepted their new reality? Or is he just as bad, if not worse?\n\nThis is both a horror novel and an excellent, razor-sharp commentary on our very real world’s relationship to consumption. It’s also — mercifully — a quick read. Highly (and only) recommend to those with strong stomachs."
