        "text": "2023 was a unique year for horror, with films ranging from microbudget fare to Hollywood sequels making headlines. Before revealing the top spots, here are some honorable mentions:\n\n“Saw X” — Even though it’s the 10th chapter in the long-running franchise, “Saw X” takes a decidedly back-to-basics approach by going back in time and making the menacing Jigsaw killer, John Kramer, the protagonist. After he’s duped into paying for a fake miracle surgery to cure his cancer, Kramer seeks revenge on the faux doctors in the only way he knows how. The twists are plentiful and the traps are stomach-churning, and by going back in time, the film dodges some of the overly-complicated plotting of previous chapters.\n\n“M3GAN” — Although it was saddled with a PG-13 rating, America’s new favorite killer doll proved to be a box office sensation and a fun theatrical watch. Owing plenty to the 2019 reboot of “Child’s Play,” this tech-gone-wrong feature was filled with enough viral moments and GIF-able kills to keep the momentum going through a thin plot. Hopefully the sequel will capitalize more off of Allison Williams’ strong performance and create an even darker experience.\n\n“Sick” — “Scream” creator Kevin Williamson co-wrote this low-profile COVID movie, a cozy mystery that felt right at home on streaming. Set primarily in one location, the claustrophobia of the central house made for a bloodthirsty experience able to gloss over budgetary restrictions. Although the ending got a little crazy, it’s nice to see a throwback slasher go for broke, with Williamson clearly having a ball again."
