        "text": "A Christmas Carol\n\nOne of the most memorable adaptations of A Christmas Carol is a short, animated film of the same name. Made in 1971 by animation icons Richard Williams, Ken Harris and Chuck Jones, this is by far the most eerie and dark version of the much-filmed Dickens classic. Despite being condensed to 25 minutes, this… Read more: A Christmas Carol\n\nAssault on Precinct 13\n\nI went through an enjoyable spate of watching early John Carpenter movies. Dark Star is an endearing ultra-low budget movie which highlights the emerging talent of Carpenter and Dan O’Bannon and will likely always have a place in college sci-fi film festivals. But it’s too unpolished and uneven for me to recommend. In contrast,… Read more: Assault on Precinct 13\n\nCash on Demand\n\nHammer Studios sometimes ventured out of the horror genre with impressive results, as I described in my recommendation of Taste of Fear, Another fine example, which ranks as one of the best B-movies in British history in any genre, is the suspenseful bank heist picture Cash on Demand. Made as cheaply as chips in… Read more: Cash on Demand\n\nCurse of the Demon\n\nDirector Jacques Tourneur didn’t make many movies and is largely forgotten today, but he has a cult following of which I am a part. He made horror films such as I Walked with a Zombie, film noirs such as Out of the Past, and films that exist somewhere in between, such as 1957’s suspenseful… Read more: Curse of the Demon\n\nDial M for Murder\n\nI have recommended a clutch of Hitchcock films (Notorious, Psycho, The 39 Steps, and The Lodger), but omitted some of his best known. Some of his classic films (e.g., Rear Window) have been written about so much that I can’ t think of anything novel to add. Others exceed my powers: I’ve seen Vertigo… Read more: Dial M for Murder\n\nDr. Terror’s House of Horrors\n\nHammer Studies is deservedly admired for the generally fine horror and suspense movies it began producing in the 1950s (including my recommendations The Devil Rides Out and Taste of Fear). But a lesser known British studio, Amicus Productions, was also productively tilling the same soil. Most notably, it revived the horror anthology form created… Read more: Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors\n\nForgotten Draculas **Triple Feature**\n\nOther perhaps than The Bible and The Sherlock Holmes stories, no book has inspired as many movies as Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Everyone knows the famous Bela Lugosi version, but few people are aware of the versions I am recommending here. Count Dracula was broadcast on BBC in 1977, and is perhaps closer to the… Read more: Forgotten Draculas **Triple Feature**\n\nGrip of the Strangler\n\nWhen Jean Kent died, I decided to watch one of her films that I had never seen, and came away happy that I did. In one of her many roles as a naughty British lass, Kent is a chanteuse/madam threatened by a serial killer apparently risen from the grave in this week’s film recommendation:… Read more: Grip of the Strangler\n\nHouse on Haunted Hill\n\nProducer/director William Castle was part film maker and part carnival barker, being famous for gimmicks such as placing nurses in theater lobbies ostensibly to aid any viewers who were overcome with fright, wiring seats to give mild shocks when a monstrous “Tingler” came on the screen, and, for this week’s film, pioneering “Emergo” technology… Read more: House on Haunted Hill\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 Version)\n\nFor political paranoia, it’s hard to top a movie that is at once a sci-fi chiller, a B-movie classic, and an utterly unnerving destruction of any ability you may have to trust the people around you. It’s the legendary original adaptation of Jack Finney’s Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Made for peanuts in 1956,… Read more: Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 Version)\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 Version)\n\nWhen I recommend multiple adaptations of the same story, I typically package them as double or triple features. But in this case, the remake of a classic film I have recommended is so well-made and so distinctly its own work of art that I grant it an essay of its own: the 1978 version… Read more: Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 Version)\n\nIt\n\nMost made-for-television movies are disappointing. Most movies based on Stephen King books, likewise. But here’s a nightmare-inducing film that overturns both those rules: The 1990 adaptation of It. Ask an adult who saw it many years ago what they remember and you may hear, after a shudder, the half-whispered words “That clown…”. The plot… Read more: It\n\nKiss Me Deadly\n\nThey? A wonderful word. And who are they? They’re the nameless ones who kill people for the Great Whatsit. Does it exist? Who cares? Everyone everywhere is so involved in the fruitless search for what? In 1955, detective film noirs were nearing the end of their magnificent cycle, with seemingly little fresh to say.… Read more: Kiss Me Deadly\n\nLa Maschera del Demonio\n\nAmerican film fans probably associate Italy first with spaghetti westerns, and next with romances or white telephone films. Few realize that Bel Paese is also the source of some chilling horror fare, including the 1960 film that put Mario Bava on the map: La Maschera del Demonio. The story opens with a witch (Barbara… Read more: La Maschera del Demonio\n\nLes Yeux Sans Visage\n\nIn the decades immediately following the war, French film makers didn’t produce many horror movies, but when they did they took more risks than studios in other countries who simply revived classic monsters or reworked hoary ghost stories. Among the most compelling and influential of such productions shocked audiences when it was released in… Read more: Les Yeux Sans Visage\n\nLured\n\nNo doubt you have often said “I’d love to watch a 1947 Douglas Sirk movie starring Lucille Ball and Boris Karloff that was a remake of a French film and was re-made again a half century later with Lucy’s part played by Al Pacino.” Okay, you’ve never said that, but nonetheless I gave you… Read more: Lured\n\nMän Som Hatar Kvinnor\n\nThe left-wing Swedish author Stieg Larsson had a strange and remarkable life. As a teenager, he witnessed some of his friends commit gang rape, and was haunted thereafter both by guilt about his failure to intervene and the omnipresence of violence against women. As a journalist he was unknown outside of Sweden when he… Read more: Män Som Hatar Kvinnor\n\nMasque of the Red Death\n\nLow budget film genius Roger Corman once said the two films he was proudest of were The Intruder (a searing film about racism and civil rights which I recommended here) and the superb horror movie Masque of the Red Death. Corman had been enchanted by Edgar Allen Poe stories since reading The Fall of… Read more: Masque of the Red Death\n\nMurder by the Clock\n\nIn its early days, Hollywood turned out some engaging films about ghoulies, ghosties, long-legged beasties and things that go bump in the night. Let me offer an admittedly off-beat film recommendation from the early days of talkies: 1931’s Murder by the Clock. The plot centers on the Endicotts, a wealthy family in decline. The… Read more: Murder by the Clock\n\nMy Name is Julia Ross and Dead of Winter **Double Feature**\n\nThe 1941 novel The Woman in Red has been used as the basis of a film twice, with a four-decade gap between versions. As a special double feature, I recommend both adaptations: 1945’s My Name is Julia Ross and 1987’s Dead Of Winter. My Name is Julia Ross was a modestly budgeted Columbia production… Read more: My Name is Julia Ross and Dead of Winter **Double Feature**\n\nNight of the Eagle\n\nFritz Leiber Jr. was a talented fantasy, science fiction and horror writer who is mainly remembered for the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser books, which surprisingly have never been adapted for the cinema. In contrast, Leiber’s Conjure Wife has served as the basis of multiple movies, including the fine 1962 film Night of the… Read more: Night of the Eagle\n\nNight Slaves and The Screaming Woman **Double Feature**\n\nI generally don’t recommend made-for-TV movies because they generally aren’t worth watching (With some exceptions, such as Stephen King’s It). But there was a quality series of such films in the 1970s known as the “ABC Movie of the Week”. It gave audiences memorable moments such as Karen Black being stalked by an evil… Read more: Night Slaves and The Screaming Woman **Double Feature**\n\nObsession\n\nIn my recommendation of Dear Murderer, I described my fondness forBritish films in which brutal people say awful things with perfect manners and diction. Another fine example of the “Terribly sorry old chap, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to kill you” school of Brit Noir is 1949’s Obsession. Like Dear Murderer, the… Read more: Obsession\n\nOnibaba\n\nWhen movie aficionados think of Japan, their minds typically turn to Akira Kurosawa. That’s understandable, as one could make a plausible case for him being the best director in the history of cinema. But Kurosawa is far from the only brilliant filmmaker to hail from the Land of the Rising Sun. Another is… Read more: Onibaba\n\nPsycho\n\nPart of Alfred Hitchcock’s magnificence as a filmmaker stemmed from his restlessness. He ruled 1950s cinema, delighting both audiences and critics with big budget, suspense-and-romance movies shot in glossy color. The studio heads at Paramount Pictures expected that for the final film he was contracted to shoot for them, he would go back to… Read more: Psycho\n\nSeven Days to Noon\n\nI make no secret of my disdain for flabby filmmaking. Many modern movies (e.g., almost every superhero movie of recent years) would be significantly better with a merciless edit of tiresome exposition, distracting subplots, saggy scenes, wordy dialogue, soulless CGI, and other forms of artistic bloat. I can hear the whines already “But I… Read more: Seven Days to Noon\n\nSuspiria\n\nItalian producer/director/writer Dario Argento has been an international force in horror films for half a century. His “art house slasher movies” began incorporating supernatural elements in the mid-1970s (e.g., the psychic character in Deep Red) and went further in that direction in his best film, the ultra-stylish, ultra-bloody, and ultra nerve-jangling Suspiria. The plot:… Read more: Suspiria\n\nTales of Terror\n\nLow budget whiz Roger Corman revered Edgar Allen Poe and brought his stories to a new generation through film. The best known is probably Masque of the Red Death (my recommendation here), but most of them are rewarding, including Tales of Terror. This 1962 film is a trilogy of stories based on four different… Read more: Tales of Terror\n\nTarantula\n\n“Invasion of the Giant-Sized X” films were almost their own genre in the 1950s. Many of them were wretched (Attack of the 50 Foot Woman being generally considered the nadir), but some of them stand the test of time. If forced to choose my favorite giant insect film I would go with Them!, but… Read more: Tarantula\n\nTaste of Fear\n\nLondon-based Hammer Films had a fertile and fiscally rewarding period in the 1950s and 1960s styling itself as the British second coming of the old Universal Studios Monster Movies. They gave Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy quite a workout, relying on generally solid and scary scripts, a stable of dependable stage-trained actors, not-bad special… Read more: Taste of Fear\n\nThe 39 Steps\n\nAlfred Hitchcock had a successful directing career in Britain that preceded his American super-stardom. Hitchcock fans rightfully consider the 1935 comedy-romance-thriller The 39 Steps among the very best works of the Master’s “British period”. Robert Donat cuts a dash as Mr. Hannay, the hero of the film, who tries to save England from the… Read more: The 39 Steps\n\nThe Body Snatcher\n\nAt RKO during World War II, Ukrainian-American producer Val Lewton developed a signature horror film style that influenced many subsequent filmmakers and also helped launch some notable Hollywood careers (e.g., Directors Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and Mark Robson). Lewton didn’t have the big budgets that let Universal Studios parade all those magnificent monsters across… Read more: The Body Snatcher\n\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nFilm buffs are one of the few groups of people who have extremely positive associations with the words “Weimar Republic”. The German film industry had an embarrassment of talent and explosive creativity in the 1920s. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is one of a number of innovative German movies of the era that profoundly… Read more: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\n\nThe Cat and the Canary\n\nGod bless film restorers. When I first saw the Hollywood film that established the template for haunted house movies, I thought it was an above average flick, but I couldn’t recommend it because the scratched up, herky-jerky quality of the available print detracted so much from the viewing experience. But cinematic magicians at the… Read more: The Cat and the Canary\n\nThe Changeling\n\nBecause haunted house movies have been a staple of cinema for nearly a century, it’s hard for filmmakers to find fresh ways to grip audiences with that mixture of cobwebs, dark hallways, creaking doors, and restless spirits that makes for an enjoyably horrifying night at the movies. In 1980, a Canadian film nevertheless managed… Read more: The Changeling\n\nThe Devil Rides Out\n\nIf you have a chance to make a deal with Satan, you might consider asking for Dennis Wheatley’s book sales and film royalties. Among Wheatley’s many best sellers were a series of thrillers featuring the Duke de Richleau and his three loyal friends Simon Aaron, Rex Van Ryn, and Richard Eaton (Wheatley loosely modelled… Read more: The Devil Rides Out\n\nThe Hands of Orlac\n\nThe idea that a possession or even more creepily a body part of a dead person can take over the life of its living owner has appeared in fairy tales and ghost stories for centuries. In cinema, the touchstone story of this sort is Maurice Renard’s 1920 novel Les Mains d’Orlac, which has been… Read more: The Hands of Orlac\n\nThe Hitch-Hiker\n\nIda Lupino was a central figure in the breaking of the all-male lock on the Hollywood director’s chair. While she was looking for a new project to make with her then-husband Collier Young, she met one of the men who had been kidnapped and forced to drive through Mexico by spree killer Billy Cook.… Read more: The Hitch-Hiker\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles (1959)\n\nHound of the Baskervilles has a special place in The Sherlock Holmes canon. Arthur Conan Doyle’s story is substantially longer than the typical Holmes outing, allowing him to weave two distinct mystery tales together. It’s also remarkable for putting Watson at center stage for a significant part of the book, allowing the sidekick a… Read more: The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959)\n\nThe Howling (Plus a Trivia Quiz!)\n\nThere may be only one film that’s more packed with references to other horror films than Scream: Joe Dante’s 1981 cult favorite, The Howling. Originally intended as a straight-ahead werewolf film, it was changed significantly in tone by a late-arriving co-screenwriter, the ever-creative John Sayles. Sayles kept the scary bits, but added a pile… Read more: The Howling (Plus a Trivia Quiz!)\n\nThe Innocents\n\nMany an eerie film has been described as a “spine-tingling” experience, but few live up to that description literally for most cineastes. The movie that did that to me more than any other, giving me physical shivers like a bucket of ice down my back, is The Innocents. Producer/Director Richard Clayton’s 1961 art house… Read more: The Innocents\n\nThe Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane\n\nHollywood superstar Jodie Foster had a remarkable 1976, with five movies hitting the theaters. They showcased her talent and poise — both startling for an actress who has just become a teenager — and also the tendency of 1970s cinema to lionize teenage liberation while at the same time exploiting it through sexualization. Foster’s… Read more: The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane\n\nThe Lodger **Double Feature**\n\nI had long wanted to experience Alfred Hitchcock’s first foray into suspense, 1927’s The Lodger (sometimes subtitled “A Story of the London Fog”), but could never get through the film because the available prints were so beat up as to make it virtually unwatchable. To the rescue came British Film Institute, which despite the… Read more: The Lodger **Double Feature**\n\nThe Man Who Laughs\n\nA woman has seen my face, and yet may love me. When people recall Universal Studio’s famous run of monster movies, they generally think of the fine films that began appearing in the 1930s (e.g., Dracula, Frankenstein, et al). But those talkies are actually the second generation of what producer Carl Laemmle began in… Read more: The Man Who Laughs\n\nThe Most Dangerous Game\n\nOne Halloween, I was looking for a lurid and creepy pre-code film to recommend. I was tempted by White Zombie but like many films of the period, the existing prints are sadly too beaten up to make the film an enjoyable experience. But then I found a movie that is not only better purely… Read more: The Most Dangerous Game\n\nThe Night Stalker and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde **Double Feature**\n\nI’m a fan of the horror and science fiction work of writer Richard Matheson and Producer/Director Dan Curtis, including films on which they collaborated, like the electrifying Amelia segment of Trilogy of Terror (My recommendation here) Their admirers could argue forever about which of their films were the most entertaining, but purely in terms… Read more: The Night Stalker and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde **Double Feature**\n\nThe Parallax View\n\nThe horrifying assassinations of the 1960s generated countless conspiracy theories that continued to rattle about in the 1970s, particularly after Watergate further damaged the public’s faith in once-respected institutions. During this period, Alan J. Pakula was arguably the film maker who most effectively translated the public’s anxieties onto the screen. The two best known… Read more: The Parallax View\n\nThe Silent Partner\n\nAmong bank heist movies are some gems that inject a clever plot twist or perspective that livens up the otherwise familiar contours of the subgenre, including Inside Man, Charley Varrick, and JCVD. In 1978, a small Canadian film earned a place among such worthies by crafting a story that is as much a character… Read more: The Silent Partner\n\nThe Wicker Man\n\nNot long after the Callan TV show ended (My recommendation here), Edward Woodward starred in an unconventional low-budget horror film that has no monsters or ghosts, includes almost no night time scenes, blood, gore or special effects, yet is unquestionably harrowing: 1973’s The Wicker Man. The plot: Uptight, devout and dedicated Police Sergeant Howie… Read more: The Wicker Man\n\nThem!\n\nBefore Aliens, before Starship Troopers, before The Swarm, even before Tarantula (my recommendation here), Hollywood discovered that bigging up bugs into a threat to humanity could translate a prevalent human anxiety into a nerve-jangling cinematic experience. The year was 1954 and the movie has since became revered as a trendsetting sci-fi classic: Them! As… Read more: Them!\n\nThree Adaptations of I Am Legend\n\nOne of the best books I read in 2018 was the sci-fi/horror classic I am Legend by Richard Matheson. Matheson wrote it in 1954, years before he became famous as one of the creative forces behind The Twilight Zone. It’s a grim, powerful, novel about isolation and trauma, centering on Robert Neville, the last… Read more: Three Adaptations of I Am Legend\n\nTightrope\n\nLong before Louisiana started offering massive tax credits to attract Hollywood productions, the state was a popular setting for crime dramas. Some played off the haunting atmosphere of the bayous (e.g., the mediocre adaptations of James Lee Burke’s Dave Robicheaux novels, Heaven’s Prisoners and In the Electric Mist) whereas others were built around New… Read more: Tightrope\n\nTrilogy of Terror – Amelia\n\n“Doll horror” is almost its own cinematic sub-genre. Villains like the murderous clown doll in Poltergeist, the knife-wielding Chucky, and the ventriloquist’s dummy in Dead of Night, all scared the pants off of audiences. Let me recommend another triumph of the subgenre: The Amelia segment of the 1975 movie Trilogy of Terror. Trilogy of… Read more: Trilogy of Terror – Amelia\n\nUnman, Wittering and Zigo\n\nI have recommended the film Flirting, in which sadistic masters torment the new students in a boys’ school. I now turn the tables by recommending a film in which a new teacher John Ebony (David Hemmings) and his wife Silvia (Carolyn Seymour) are terrorized by the fifth form from hell. The last three students… Read more: Unman, Wittering and Zigo\n\nVampyr\n\nSome film historians consider Carl Theodor Dreyer cinema’s most visionary director. His talent is on vivid, memorable display in the pioneering 1932 horror classic Vampyr. The story, which Dreyer and co-writer Christen Jul adapted in part from the writings of Sheridan Le Fanu of Carmilla fame, concerns a student of the occult named Allan… Read more: Vampyr"
