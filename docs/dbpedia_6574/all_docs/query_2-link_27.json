        "text": "You could dress up with your beau for some trick or treating, or you could just snuggle up with a fall cocktail and a spooky Halloween flick. Pardon us while we go with what’s behind door number two. We can’t, err, mask our excitement for the holiday that demands its revelers to partake in as many activities that scare them to the bone as they can, like reading chilling short stories and witch-centric books, or spending two hours with blood thirsty vampires. But our all-time favorite way of getting into the spirit of All Hallow’s Eve (besides a good playlist) is to turn the lights down low and turn up the volume on a good ol' ghost movie, featuring specters along the scale from friendly to horrifying.\n\nScroll through for some of the most unnerving supernatural films and thrillers on Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu and beyond. Catch up on the original Candyman before Nia DaCosta's highly anticipated remake arrives to terrify you, or bask in a slow-burn like . Recent movies like Netflix's His House mix social issues with ghost stories. But, of course, the most haunting ghost movies of all are the ones supposedly based on true stories, like the classic paranormal movie . And, if you prefer your frights a little more PG, we have great movies for kids starring \"nice\" ghosts, like Casper, and some comedies for you, too.\n\nDeAnna Janes is a freelance writer and editor for a number of sites, including Harper’s BAZAAR, Tasting Table, Fast Company and Brit + Co, and is a passionate supporter of animal causes, copy savant, movie dork and reckless connoisseur of all holidays. A native Texan living in NYC since 2005, Janes has a degree in journalism from Texas A&M and got her start in media at US Weekly before moving on to O Magazine, and eventually becoming the entertainment editor of the once-loved, now-shuttered DailyCandy.
