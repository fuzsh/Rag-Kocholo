        "text": "Trick or treat? Here‚Äôs a treat for you‚Ä¶\n\nTo celebrate the October 15th release of Halloween Kills, the new film in the blockbuster horror series from Universal Pictures, Miramax and Blumhouse‚ÄìMessenger, Instagram, and Facebook are releasing a brand-new Movie Mate‚Ñ¢ chat experience featuring the franchise‚Äôs iconic star, Jamie Lee Curtis!\n\nIn 2018, David Gordon Green‚Äôs Halloween, starring Jamie Lee Curtis, set a new record for the biggest opening weekend in history for a horror film featuring an actress in a leading role. In Halloween Kills, Michael Myers resumes his ritual bloodbath, but as Curtis‚Äô Laurie Strode prepares to defend herself against him, she inspires a vigilante mob to rise up and hunt Michael down once and for all.\n\nWe believe Halloween screams and scares should be shared with friends and fam. Starting today, Movie Mate‚Ñ¢, Messenger‚Äôs first-of-its-kind ‚Äúsecond screen‚Äù chat experience, is available for Halloween (2018), and for Halloween Kills, playing in theaters and streaming only on Peacock, on October 15th.\n\nTune in as Movie Mate‚Ñ¢ answers movie watchers‚Äô burning questions in real time (with a little help from Jamie Lee Curtis) and offers never-before-seen photos and footage, so you‚Äôll feel like a superfan, even if it‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôve dared to see a Halloween flick. To access the Halloween Movie Mate‚Ñ¢ experience on Messenger, head to the Halloween Movie Facebook page and click ‚Äòsend message‚Äô to begin the chat experience or type ‚ÄòHalloween Movie Mate‚Äô in the searchbar of the Messenger app. On Instagram, send a DM to @HalloweenMovie to start the experience.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to be continuing our partnership with Universal by bringing films from the iconic Halloween franchise to the Movie Mate‚Ñ¢ experience. There‚Äôs no doubt scary movies are more enjoyable with friends, so for this experience you‚Äôll have the scream queen herself, Jaime Lee Curtis, along for the show. With the Movie Mate‚Ñ¢ experience now available on both Messenger and Instagram, even more fans can enhance their movie nights with this immersive and interactive second-screen experience.‚Äù said Nicky Bell VP, Global Head of Facebook Creative Shop.\n\nBe sure to check out new Movie Mate‚Ñ¢ experiences and features in the coming months that will immerse you in whichever movie or tv show you‚Äôre tuning into. Boo! From all of us at Messenger, Happy Halloween! üéÉ"
