He was introduced to film industry by the famous director Peraala in his action film Aavesha (1990) co-starring Shankar Nag, Geetha and Bhavya. He was paired with yet another debutant Shivaranjini in this film. The film went on to become success at the box-office. This was quickly followed by the epic blockbuster war film Muthina Haara directed by Rajendra Singh Babu and starred Vishnuvardhan and Suhasini. He played the son role of Vishnuvardhan who gets killed in the war. The film was one of the milestone success in Kannada cinema.\n\nFollowing his initial brief roles, Ramkumar came back in 1993 through the film Gejje Naada in a lead role opposite a newcomer Shwetha. The film was declared a musical hit with his performance being lauded. This was followed by a devotional biographical film Bhagawan Sri Saibaba which had an ensemble cast. In 1994, he starred in B. C. Patil's story Poorna Sathya which failed at the box-office. The years 1995 and 1996 saw his maximum number of films releasing of which only Kavya, Thayi Illada Thavaru, Thavarina Thottilu and Gaaya proved to be successful. His other films were completely wash outs with back to back failures."
