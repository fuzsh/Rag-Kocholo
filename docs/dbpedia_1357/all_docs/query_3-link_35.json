        "text": "Funke Akindele will forever remain grateful to Mo Abudu. For giving her the first opportunity to direct a film. This might be surprising to you, but permit me to inform you that Funke Akindele‚Äôs directorial debut was with EbonyLife‚Äôs film titled ‚ÄúYour Excellency‚Äù in 2019. But today, Funke Akindele has gone on to become the highest-grossing film director in Nollywood with her film ‚ÄúA Tribe Called Judah‚Äù. So, as you proceed with your film project this week, let me ask you. üìå Which new actor are you casting? üìå Which new director are you giving a chance? üìå Which new editor are you banking on? Remember, you were once like them, full of ideas but hoping for opportunities to showcase them. Take a chance on at least one creative this week and you might just have shone a light on another SUPERSTAR.

Call us on 0734 777 778 and let us hold your hand in this journey. #talantainstitute #talantamasterclass #elimikanambogi\n\nmy next short film is a drama. unlike other drama films, mine really focuses more on realistic situations. i watch a lot of movies and feel honesty is really missing in many of them regardless of genre. so i try to find stories that need to be explored more truthfully. sometimes I'll just watch something on the big screen or whatever, and i think \"ok, this is really fake. i don't buy that performance. i don't agree with that line statement, etc.\" so when i work with actors, i really enforce the honesty otherwise i won't waste my time on the set. so the story, the actors, and even the sets have a real value or purpose in my movies. i call my actors' performances \"documentary-style acting\" because i want every scene to be 100% accurate. they still look like movies but unlike other movies, i really make sure when you do watch them, you really forget you are watching an actor and feel like this is really happening right now like a documentary."
