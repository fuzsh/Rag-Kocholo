        "text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. — Thomas Lane, a former Minneapolis police officer who held down George Floyd’s legs as he gasped for air while dying under the knee of another officer, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on Thursday.\n\nA federal judge in St. Paul handed down the sentence to Mr. Lane several months after a jury found him guilty of violating Mr. Floyd’s rights by not providing him with medical care after Derek Chauvin, the other officer, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. Mr. Lane, who is also waiting to be sentenced over a state manslaughter charge, will be the second officer imprisoned over Mr. Floyd’s death, which set off a summer of protests across the United States in 2020.\n\nMr. Lane’s sentence showed that the judge, Paul Magnuson, was willing to imprison a police officer who was not primarily responsible for Mr. Floyd’s death, though the sentence imposed was less than half as long as what prosecutors had sought. Mr. Floyd’s relatives had asked the judge to impose the maximum prison term possible and said afterward that they were upset by the sentence.\n\n“It’s insulting that he didn’t get the maximum amount of time,” said Philonise Floyd, one of Mr. Floyd’s brothers, adding: “If it was me and that was accessory to murder, they would’ve gave me the maximum amount of time. And you’re a police officer who was sworn to protect, who took an oath, and you didn’t get the maximum amount of time.”"
