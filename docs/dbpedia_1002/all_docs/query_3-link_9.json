        "text": "I grew up in North Harrow, attending Pinner Park and then Hatch End High Schools.\n\nI’ve lived in Rayners Lane and South Harrow and am living with my young family in central Harrow.\n\nBefore I was elected I was a teacher in a school nearby.\n\nMy children were both born recently at Northwick Park Hospital and we can use Alexandra Avenue Walk-In Centre and local GPs.\n\nWhen Labour was in Government I was Minister for International Development and responsible for Britain’s aid to Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka, and then was Minister for Africa. I was also Minister for Trade leading on trade negotiations with the European Union and other countries such as India, Singapore and China.\n\nBefore I went into Government I campaigned for investment in wind and solar power, have championed co-operatives; particularly housing and financial services co-operatives, and was Chair of the Co-op Party in Parliament until 2019.\n\nSince the April 2020 I have served on Labour’s Front Bench as Shadow Minister for International Trade.\n\nIn spare moments I like to go running and am always training for my next go at the Harrow Half-Marathon."
