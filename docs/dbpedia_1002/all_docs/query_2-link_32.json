        "text": "Lane and two other former Minneapolis officers were convicted by a federal jury in February.\n\nBy Stephen Montemayor\n\nJuly 21, 2022 at 5:11PM\n\nThomas Lane pleaded guilty in May and agreed to a sentence of three years in a separate state case. (Hennepin County Sheriff's Office/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\nA federal judge sentenced former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane to 2½ years in prison in the federal civil rights case linked to the 2020 killing of George Floyd — delivering a lighter sentence than what prosecutors had urged.\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson handed down the 30-month sentence during an hourlong hearing in St. Paul.\n\n\"This is a very serious offense wherein a life was lost,\" Magnuson said before sentencing Lane. \"The fact that you did not get up and remove [Derek] Chauvin from Mr. Floyd when Mr. Floyd became unresponsive is a violation of the law.\"\n\nYet Magnuson — who called Lane \"a person of outstanding character\" and held up a large stack of 145 letters sent to the judge in support of Lane — acknowledged a lesser culpability in causing Floyd's death.\n\nOne of four officers charged both in state and federal court in connection with Floyd's May 25, 2020, murder, Lane held Floyd's legs as Chauvin knelt on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. Lane twice asked if the officers should reposition Floyd and later attempted CPR after paramedics loaded Floyd into an ambulance. But prosecutors argued that he did not do enough to aid Floyd.\n\nEarl Gray, Lane's attorney, previously asked for a 27-month sentence, noting that his client had an \"impeccable\" character. Federal prosecutors sought a sentence of between 5¼ and 6½ years in prison for Lane, well below the more than 20-year sentence that Magnuson imposed on Chauvin earlier this month.\n\n\"It is fair and reasonable for a police officer to act when they both appreciate the seriousness of the situation and have the training to make a difference,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Manda Sertich said in court Thursday. \"But there has to be a line where blindly following a senior officer's lead even for the newest officers cannot be acceptable and that line is surely crossed when someone is dying slowly in front of the new officer.\"\n\nAfter a 21-day trial, Lane and former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were found guilty by a jury in February of violating Floyd's civil rights while acting in their capacity as law enforcement officers. Both Kueng and Lane were convicted of charges tied to their failure to give Floyd medical care. Kueng and Thao were also convicted on charges related to not trying to stop Chauvin from using excessive force.\n\nabout the writer\n\nStephen Montemayor\n\nReporter\n\nStephen Montemayor covers federal courts and law enforcement.
