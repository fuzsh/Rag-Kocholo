        "text": "The TFTA Agreement is Long Overdue and here what happens if we get this working! COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) Agreement would be monumental step towards economic integration and growth across Africa. ðŸ’¼ Widening Our Market, Boosting Our Economy ðŸ’¼ The TFTA Agreement opens up a single market of 13 countries (at the moment), providing African businesses with access to new opportunities. This is crucial for growth, especially when considering the relatively small populations of individual African countries compared to global powers like the USA and the EU ðŸ“Š The Power of Numbers: Comparing Markets ðŸ“Š Kenya: Population of ~53 million USA: Population of ~331 million EU: Population of ~450 million With the TFTA, African countries can combine their markets, significantly boosting our collective buying power and economic potential. Imagine the impact of trading freely across borders with a combined population of over 700 million! Hitting plateaus by start ups and established business will decrease as they enter into new markets! ðŸŒ± Fueling Economic Growth ðŸŒ± Increased Trade: The removal of tariffs and trade barriers will lead to a surge in intra-African trade. Market Expansion: Businesses can now access a broader customer base, leading to higher sales and revenue. Investment Opportunities: A more integrated market attracts both local and international investments, fostering economic growth. ðŸ“ˆ Looking Forward to a Prosperous Future ðŸ“ˆ The TFTA Agreement is a game-changer for African trade and needs to be implemented to the fullest. We expect that in the future that the whole of Africa can trade freely. Itâ€™s time to leverage this opportunity to expand our markets, increase our economic growth, and enhance our global competitiveness. ðŸ’¬ Join the Conversation! ðŸ’¬ What are your thoughts on the TFTA Agreement?
