        "text": "Newly elected Labour MP Fred Thomas has vowed to make rebuilding the NHS a priority when he arrives in Westminster. The former Royal Marine sensationally unseated Tory Johnny Mercer in Plymouth Moor View, with a majority of 5,604.\n\nMr Thomas, who won with 17,665 votes, said he had been delighted with a positive campaign and pledged to start delivering for his constituents in the north of the city. He said the NHS was a priority for Keir Starmer’s newly elected Labour Government and for him in the city - with Derriford Hospital being in his constituency.\n\nHe said improving public services generally were a key objective - and bringing down energy bills.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nPlymouth General Election results\n\nTories cling on in South West Devon\n\nMr Thomas said: “The campaign has been really positive, it’s been an absolute joy to talk to thousands of residents throughout the campaign over the last six weeks, and over the last year, we’ve been knocking on doors all year.\n\n“So it’s been an absolute pleasure. My priority is setting up my constituency office and my parliamentary office so I can start delivering for constituents as soon as possible and once we are up and running I want to be part of the Labour Government, changing people’s lives, getting the NHS back on its feet, and bringing down energy bills.”\n\nWhen asked specifically about Plymouth, Mr Thomas said: “I’m in this for the public service , I’m from a public services background, so getting our public services back on their feet, particularly the NHS will be my number one priority.”"
