        "text": "Former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane was sentenced to three years in prison Wednesday for aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd.\n\nLane pleaded guilty to the state charge in May. He also was convicted in February on federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights, for which he's serving a 2½ year sentence at a low-security federal prison camp in Littleton, Colorado.\n\nLane appeared at his sentencing hearing Wednesday via video from Federal Correctional Institution Englewood. As part of his plea deal, he will serve his state sentence in federal prison at the same time as his federal sentence.\n\nLane held down Floyd's legs as former officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck during an attempted arrest on May 25, 2020. Former officers J. Alexander Kueng knelt on Floyd's back and Tou Thao kept bystanders away during the restraint, which was captured on bystander video.\n\nThe killing sparked global protests over racial justice and police brutality.\n\nImpact of protests: A look at how cities, states are responding to police brutality\n\nKueng and Thao were also convicted on federal civil rights charges and sentenced to three years and 3½ years in prison respectively.\n\nThey are not yet serving their federal sentences and are expected to go on trial on state charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in October after rejecting plea deals. As part of Lane's plea agreement, the more serious count of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder against was dropped.\n\nChauvin was found guilty of murder and manslaughter and sentenced to 22½ years in prison in 2021. He pleaded guilty to violating Floyd's civil rights in federal court in December and is serving his state and federal sentences concurrently.\n\nMore: Derek Chauvin gets 21-year federal sentence for violating George Floyd's civil rights\n\nTrial of ex-officers in George Floyd's death: Was it their duty to intervene?\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"
