        "text": "LITTLETON, Colo. (KTTC) – A former Minneapolis police officer has completed his federal sentence of two-and-a-half years for his role in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nThomas Lane is incarcerated at the Englewood Federal Prison facility in Littleton, Colorado and has now completed his sentencing requirements after pleading guilty to depriving Floyd of his civil rights in May of 2020.\n\nLane also pleaded guilty to state charges of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in connection with Floyd’s death. Lane was sentenced to three years in prison to be served concurrently with his federal charges as part of the plea agreement.\n\nMinnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) spokesperson Shannon Loehrke confirmed to KTTC’s sister station in the Twin Cities KARE 11 that Lane has completed his federal sentence and the DOC is contracting with the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to continue to house Lane in Colorado while he completes his Minnesota sentence.\n\nLane is scheduled to be released from prison to supervision on Aug. 20, 2024. His full sentence, including supervision, ends on Aug. 20, 2025.\n\nFloyd died after Officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the ground with a knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe.\n\nFellow officers Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, along with Lane, were convicted of violating Floyd’s civil rights in a federal trial in February of 2022 by not intervening when Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck.\n\nAll three officers were also charged with denying Floyd his right to medical care.\n\nDerek Chauvin was sentenced to 22.5 years after being convicted of second-degree manslaughter, second-degree murder and third-degree murder for Floyd’s death. In May 2022, a federal judge gave Chauvin a 21 year sentence after accepting the terms of Chauvin’s plea agreement for the federal civil rights case.\n\nFind stories like this and more, in our apps."
