Born on October 29, 1942, in Jackson, TN, Tom was the son of John A. and Mary Harrell Lane.\n\nTom married the love of his life, Lavon Cotter, on October 29, 1966, in East Peoria. Together, they raised three children: Tom (Genenda) Lane Jr., of Peoria; Valeri (Eric) Burgess of Mossville, IL; and Vicki (Mark) Badura of Powell, WY. Tom was a devoted family man, always putting his family first. He was a source of strength, wisdom, and love for his wife, children, and five grandchildren: Jordon, Peyton, Zayda, Reigan, and Logun. His love also extended to his sister, Barbara (Cleon) Brewer, of Mossville, IL, and his brother, Robert Lane, of Peoria Heights, IL. His parents and two brothers John “Sonny” Lane Jr. and James R.
