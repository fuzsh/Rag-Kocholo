        "text": "Labour’s Gareth Thomas has kept hold of the Harrow West seat with a reduced majority of 6,642 on a 56.85 per cent turnout. The constituency has been represented by Mr Thomas MP since he was first elected back in 1997.\n\nMr Thomas MP praised his fellow candidates for their ‘courage’ to stand for a seat in parliament and thanked residents of Harrow West for ‘once again putting their trust’ in him to represent them in parliament.\n\nAddressing the crowd following his win, Mr Thomas MP said: “Throughout the course of the campaign, what has become very clear is the people of Harrow West, like I expect the rest of the country, are desperate for change.”\n\nHe added: “There are some in this country that think we should be independent of our politics, I am absolutely determined not to be independent about the people of Harrow West.\n\n“I will always be on their side, […] always determined to represent them and seek the very best for them in Westminster and beyond.”\n\nCreated in 1945, the constituency covers the Harrow Council wards of Harrow, Wealdstone, Headstone, Rayners Lane, and South Harrow. The seat had previously been held by the Tories from its inception until Labour’s 1997 landslide victory.\n\nIn 2019, Mr Thomas retained the seat with a majority of 8,692 and 52.4 per cent of the vote share (25,132 votes). The Conservative candidate came in second place with 34.4 per cent of the vote. Tory Abbas Merali made ground on the Labour incumbent but ultimately came up short.\n\nMr Thomas has previously held three government positions, as Minister of State at: The Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department of Trade, Investment and Consumer Affairs, and the Department for International Development.\n\nFull result:\n\nGareth Thomas, LAB – 19,833\n\nAbbas Merali, CON – 13,191\n\nPamela Fitzpatrick, IND – 4,120\n\nMichael Beavis, REFORM – 2,639\n\nChris Noyce, LIB DEM- 2,404\n\nRupert Nepal George, GREEN – 2,438\n\nBharatkumar Patel, IND – 616"
