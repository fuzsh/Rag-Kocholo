        "text": "UPDATE 2/24/22 6:00 p.m. EST: Thomas Lane has been convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights when failing to receive medical help as Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on the neck of Floyd, causing him to suffocate and die. He was not charged with failing to intervene like the other two officers on-site as he did attempt to get Chauvin to stop partway through. The separate trial for his charge of second degree murder will commence in June.\n\nUPDATE 6/10 6:00 p.m. EST: Thomas Lane was been released on bail on Wednesday, June 10, according to Hennepin County Jail documents obtained by HollywoodLife. The fired officer posted his $750k bail after his family set up a donation website to raise funds for his legal defense team. Thomas Lane’s release is conditional and he faces a maximum sentence of up to 40 years in prison if he’s convicted.\n\nUPDATE 6/5 3:00pm EST: Two days after Thomas Lane, Tou Thao, and J. Alexander Kueng were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, the Minneapolis has banned the use of chokeholds by police. The agreement, which comes in conjunction with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, means that any officer is required to immediately report the use of neck restraint or chokehold to their commander or their commander’s superiors.\n\nIf an officer sees a colleague try to chokehold anyone, they must intervene verbally, or physically if necessary. Failure to do so means they could face punishment as severe as the officer committing the prohibited action, according to the Associated Press. Additionally, the police chief or a deputy chief must authorize any use of chemical agents, rubber bullets, flash-bangs, batons, and marking rounds.\n\nUPDATE 6/4 3:20pm EST: A judge set bail at $1,000,000 apiece for Lane along with Tou Thou and J. Alexander Kueng on Thursday, June 4, while they made their first appearance in court. Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with 2nd degree murder in the death of George Floyd, has his set at $500,000.\n\nFollowing the wave of peaceful protests (and violent police clashes) over the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers, former cop Thomas Lane, 37, was arrested for his involvement in the fatal arrest. Previously, ex-officer Derek Chauvin — the man identified as the one kneeling across George’s neck while he pleaded, “please, please, I can’t breathe – was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder. and manslaughter. Now, Thomas Lane, who helped restrain George, has been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced the charges in a June 3 press conference: “We’re here today because George Floyd is not here. He should be here. He should be alive but he’s not.” He went on to say, “Today I filed an amended complaint that charges former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with murder in the second degree for the death of George Floyd. I believe the evidence available to us now supports the stronger charge of second-degree murder.” (Aiding and abetting second-degree murder is punishable by up to 40 years in prison while aiding and abetting manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.)\n\n“Second, today arrest warrants were issued for former Minneapolis police officers J. A. King, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. Finally, I’d like to announce that today Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman and I have filed a complaint that charges police officer King, Lane and Thao with aiding and abetting murder in the second degree, a felony offense. I strongly believe that these developments are in the interests of justice for Mr. Floyd, his family, our community and our state.”\n\nORIGINAL: The death of George Floyd sparked a wave of demonstrations dubbed the “Fed Up-Rising.” Millions flooding the streets across the country demanding justice for George, while also calling for increased criminal justice reforms. As the country deals with the fallout of yet another black man killed by the police, here’s what you need to know about Thomas Lane.\n\n1. He’s the grandson of a detective.\n\nThomas Lane was one of the four police officers fired on May 26. He is a Twin Cities native, according to the Star Tribune. An anonymous relative described Thomas to the publication as “compassionate and amusing and insightful.” He was married in 2018, and excited to continue his family’s law enforcement legacy. His grandfather was Donald M. Mealey, a Minneapolis police detective who died in 2008 at 92. Other relatives also worked for the Minneapolis police. Thomas received his law enforcement license las August.\n\n“He doesn’t have a bad bone in his body,” the relative told the Star Tribune of Lane. “This is just a terrible event and I feel bad for the lives lost and the Floyd family.”\n\n2. He was one of the first officers on the scene.\n\nOfficers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng arrived at the Cup Foods around 8:08 pm after someone called 911 to report that a man bought merchandise with a counterfeit $20 bill, according to a criminal complaint filed by the Hennepin County Attorney. According to the document obtained by HollywoodLife, which details the final moments of George Floyd’s life, Lane and Keung approached George, who was seated in his car around the corner from the store.\n\n3. Officer Lane was the one who put George in handcuffs.\n\n“As Officer Lane began speaking with Mr. Floyd, he pulled his gun out and pointed it at Mr. Floyd’s open window and directed Mr. Floyd to show his hands,” according to the criminal complaint. “When Mr. Floyd put his hands in the steering wheel, Lane put his gun back in its holster.” Officer Lane then ordered George out of the car, “put his hands on Mr. Floyd, and pulled him out of the car,” per the complaint. It was then when Officer Lane handcuffed George.\n\n4. Officer Lane held George’s legs.\n\nMPD Officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa arrived in a separate car around 8:14 pm. They “made several attempts” to get George into the backseat of squad car 320. During this incident, George “went to the ground face down and still handcuffed.” Officer Keung held George’s back while Officer Lane held the man’s legs.\n\n5. He expressed concern during the arrest.\n\nGeorge claimed he was claustrophobic as the officers were arresting him, and while standing outside of the cop car, “began staying and repeating that he could not breathe.” When George was on the ground and pleading for help, Officer Lane asked, “should we roll him on his side?” Officer Chauvin said, according to the complaint, “No, staying put where we got him.” Officer Lane then said, “I am worried about excited delirium of whatever.” Officer Chauvin said, per the complaint, “That’s why we have him on his stomach.” At 8:24 pm, George Floyd stopped moving. An ambulance with emergency medical personnel arrived to take George to a hospital. He was later pronounced dead at the Hennepin County Medical Center."
