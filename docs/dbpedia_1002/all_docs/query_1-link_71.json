        "text": "The Blue Jays' biggest need this trade deadline is a right-handed bat to balance out the lineup, bring some slug against southpaws, and better fill the team's 26th roster spot.\n\nNationals outfielder Lane Thomas could do exactly that. That's not the only reason he's an ideal target for the Jays at the upcoming August 1st deadline:\n\nThe Fit Is Obvious\n\nLet's not bury the lede here, Thomas absolutely demolishes lefties. The 27-year-old hits .361 with a .630 slugging percentage against the weak side of the platoon, smacking 17 extra-base hits in just 119 at-bats this year.\n\nNot only would Thomas immediately become Toronto's best hitter against lefties, he'd be the second-best southpaw masher in the American League. Only Luis Robert (1.056) has a higher vs LHP OPS in the AL right now. Stick Thomas in the middle of Toronto's lineup and the lefty woes should go away.\n\nWith a history at all three outfield positions, Thomas could act as the team's fourth outfielder (and top pinch hitter) against righties and regular in the lineup against lefties. The team could DH Thomas, or push him into left field and give Whit Merrifield a few days off his feet vs LHP.\n\nControl, Control, Control\n\nThe Atkins regime has dabbled in the rental market before, acquiring Brad Hand and Jonathan Villar (whoops) at previous trade deadlines. But, the Jays have more had a penchant for the long-term deadline adds.\n\nBy acquiring Ross Stripling, José Berríos, Whit Merrifield, and others at recent deadlines, the Jays have filled deadline holes and shopped for the following season, at the same time. This deadline should be no different.\n\nThe Jays will return five starters and plenty of relievers next season, but they're set to lose a bevy of bats to free agency (Kevin Kiermaier, Brandon Belt, Matt Chapman to name a few). Bringing in a guy like Thomas, with two years of team control remaining after 2023, could help mitigate those potential offensive losses. Fill a need for now and for later.\n\nWhat Would Thomas Cost?\n\nWith Thomas raking at the plate and controllable for a few more years, he's not going to come cheap.\n\nNationals GM Mike Rizzo is publicly gassing up Thomas' value on the market, saying he's an \"all-star caliber player.\" The 27-year-old's actual trade value probably lies somewhere between the recently traded outfielders Daulton Varsho and Joey Gallo. Varsho (with four years of team control) was swapped to Toronto for the Jays' No. 1 prospect and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. last offseason while Gallo (with 1.5 years of control) went from Texas to New York a few summers ago, earning back the Yankees' No. 14, No. 15, No. 23, and No. 28 prospects.\n\nYes, there's a wide chasm between those two valuations. But, the range tells us Thomas' price would likely involve one of the Blue Jays' higher-ranked prospects (Tucker Toman, Addison Barger, or Sem Robberse?) and some lower throw-ins."
