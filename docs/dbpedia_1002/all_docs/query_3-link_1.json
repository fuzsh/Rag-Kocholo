Two years later Lane entered his master’s inn, maybe with the favour of another of Rowdon’s servants, Robert Cole. Lane’s connexion with Rowdon was probably influential in securing him a place on the council of Lord Berkeley, who bequeathed him an annuity of £3. As a practising lawyer Lane retained his Lincoln’s Inn chambers until his death, leaving his son their contents. He was employed by Cromwell in local affairs.\n\nAs his father had done earlier, Lane held office under Gloucester abbey, and at its dissolution he became steward to the dean and chapter of the new cathedral. In a will dated 4 Oct. 1544 he asked to be buried near his parents in the north aisle of the cathedral under the image of St. Sonday. Shortly before his death on the following 2 Dec., when he was living in the parish of St. John the Baptist, Lane was assessed for subsidy on lands and fees worth £40. His widow married as her third husband Richard Pate. Although he is known to have sat only in the Parliament of 1539, it is possible that Lane had been returned in 1536, the first Parliament to meet after he is known to have become recorder, or even that he had been by-elected to the Parliament of 1529 in place of John Rawlins who died in 1532, and he is likely to have been re-elected in 1542. His successor as recorder, Richard Morgan, was to sit in the three Parliaments which met during his tenure.\n\nRef Volumes: 1509-1558\n\nAuthor: A. D.K. Hawkyard\n\nNotes"
