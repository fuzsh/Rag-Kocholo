        "text": "DETROIT — On Tuesday’s edition of the Cleveland Baseball Talk podcast, Paul Hoynes and Joe Noga break down the Guardians’ trade for outfielder Lane Thomas, and what the club gave up in order to get the right-handed hitting speedster.\n\nThey also look back at a big night for José Ramírez at the plate against Detroit and ahead to the final hours before the MLB trade deadline.\n\nListen and read along with an AI-generated transcript of the podcast below.\n\nMore Guardians coverage\n\nTwins complete doubleheader sweep with 6-3 win over Guardians; losing streak at seven straight\n\nGuardians, Minnesota Twins starting lineups (Game 2) for Aug. 9, 2024: Game 116\n\nStephen Vogt explains Guardians’ transactions on transactional Friday\n\nRead the automated transcript of today’s podcast below. Because it’s a computer-generated transcript, it may contain errors and misspellings.\n\nJoe Noga (00:14):\n\nWelcome back to another edition of the Cleveland Baseball Talk podcast. I’m Joe Noga, joined by Paul Hoynes Hoey. The Guardians finally strike at the trade deadline Monday night. Just as the game was getting underway in Detroit, the guardians announced a trade with the Washington Nationals. They acquire Rightfielder Lane Thomas from Washington in exchange for three prospects including number eight overall prospect, Alex Clemy six. Six Lefty, who was the second round pick of the guardians in last year’s draft, along with Jose Tenna and Raphael Ramirez, Jr. Another infield at Low a Lynchburg Zi. Just your immediate reaction to the trade and what it means for the guardians moving forward.\n\nPaul Hoynes (01:05):\n\nYeah, I think they got their guide, Joe. They needed somebody to lengthen the lineup. They needed a right-handed hitter to balance the lineup and they needed kind of an injection of power and speed and Lane Thomas delivers on all three fronts.\n\nJoe Noga (01:22):\n\nYou mentioned speed, Thomas third in the National League, 28 Steels also caught 12 times the most of the National League, but this is a guy who fits the profile here. He can put the bat on the ball this year. His power numbers may have sagged a little bit, 28 home runs last season, but now he seems to be fitting more of that contact profile at least this season. Does he match up and fit in the guardian’s lineup the way that the other hitters on Cleveland’s roster seem to?\n\nPaul Hoynes (02:00):\n\nYeah, I think so. Joan, I think he might end a carousel in right field where they’ve used nine different guys trying to find a guy, a consistent source of run production. Thomas can perhaps really kind of take over there and see, get the lion’s share of the at bats. Now I don’t know what that means to the rest of the roster, but they brought this guy in for a reason. They want to play him. He did miss what, about a month early in the season, the end of April to the end of May with the knee injury. Perhaps that is sap, some power from him, but it looks like he’s on a roll right now. They’re getting him while he’s hot.\n\nJoe Noga (02:45):\n\nYeah, 25 consecutive games reaching base for Thomas right now. Eight home runs, 40 RBI is a 2 53 average and a 7 38 OPS in just 300 at bats. But you’re right, this is a guy who looks like he can play gold glove defense out in right field. He was a finalist a couple years back in the National League in right field. You mentioned the other guys on the roster. They’ve got John Kenzie Noel, who’s been playing a good right field, has been an extra base hits machine when he gets the chance to start. And then they’ve got Will Brennan, who’s also coming off an injury and hasn’t really seemed to recover from his time away with the ribcage injury that he suffered, hasn’t really sort of seemed to find himself since then. Moving forward, as they get deeper into the season, does this mean that there’s a roster move coming maybe when they get Lane Thomas on, somebody has to go or do they reshuffle things and try to keep everybody around?\n\nPaul Hoynes (03:59):\n\nWell, that’s a great question because Steven Vo loves to play. Everybody loves to keep everyone involved, but obviously they got to make a move, Joe. They got to create a spot on the roster for ‘em. Will Brennan has three options left, so I mean if he is the guy that could send him down, but that roster is so young and these guys have so many options that I don’t think they’re going to have a problem creating a spot for him.\n\nJoe Noga (04:30):\n\nThe other thing about Thomas that is attracted to the guardians, he has a year of control beyond this season. He’s arbitration eligible next year in 2025, doesn’t become a free agent until 2026, so his salary isn’t going to break the bank for Cleveland. Really, this seems like a pretty guardian’s front office move in terms of the kind of guy that they target and would like to bring into the organization.\n\nPaul Hoynes (05:01):\n\nYeah, no doubt about it. This is a guy that kind of fits the profile of what they were looking for. I think the main goal going into the trade deadline was to find a starter for the rotation. If they couldn’t do that, then they switched to the offense. The offense has slumped, to be honest, over the last three weeks or so, they needed an injection of some life. I think Lane Thomas brings that and the deadlines isn’t until 6:00 PM tonight, Joe, so there’s still time to add an arm.\n\nJoe Noga (05:40):\n\nYeah, we talked to Chris Antony after the game last night and he said that they’re not done pursuing, so it might not be the last trade that they make prior to the deadline. It is just will a deal for a starting picture materialize. And that’s been difficult and Antonette sort of prefaced everything last week by saying we know that the market out there for starting pitching is going to be a difficult one. It’s one of the reasons why they brought in Matt Boyd when they did as he continues to get closer to maybe making it an appearance for Cleveland at some point in the next couple of weeks. But if they’re not able to go after another starting pitcher, could they maybe add another bat? Is that something that’s on the table as well?\n\nPaul Hoynes (06:27):\n\nI think everything’s on the table right now. They have an opportunity to improve this ball club. The team, they know this is a special season, kind of an out of nowhere season where they’ve caught a lot of teams by surprise. They played very, very well and I don’t think you can waste that. So if they can find another area where they can help this club, maybe a short stop, maybe an infielder with a little more impact with the bat that could help them, I think they’d be foolish not to pursue that.\n\nJoe Noga (07:02):\n\nAnd we talked to Jose Ramirez, we talked to Tanner Bobby last night. Obviously this is a move that was welcomed by the clubhouse as well for the front office to sort of show that faith that they recognize that this is a team that needs maybe a little bit of a boost and that they believe that this team can go out there and contend for a championship. The message that it sends to the players is an important one as well.\n\nPaul Hoynes (07:30):\n\nYeah, yeah, definitely. And you need to do that as a front office when you have the right situation, you have to show that you have confidence in the ball club. You think they can win. You think they not only can win, but they can do some damage in the postseason and that’s why you make a move like this. So I think it’ll be well received in the locker room by everyone who isn’t affected by it, who isn’t directly affected by it. A who loses playing time, B, who loses their spot on the roster\n\nJoe Noga (08:08):\n\nAs far as they finally make a move to trade away a middle infielder as far as they had this backlog, this stockpile of middle infielders guys like Tenna who can play up the middle play really good defense and we’re just coming into sort of their own as hitters 10 is a guy who had a little bit of experience with the Major League club, probably the most major league ready out of any of the guys included in the deal going back to Washington. But Chris Antonette said after the game, this one hurts what they had to give up in this deal. Don’t take it lightly because they did deal away Prospect Capital in this Tenna being obviously the most veteran of the group, but Alex Clemy, 19 years old, six foot six lanky left-hander who was putting up good strikeout numbers at Lynchburg in his first full season. In the pros, he’s your number eight prospect according to MLB pipeline and now he’ll be with the Washington Nationals. Obviously not a move that they like to make in dealing a pitcher with a lot of upside, but he was attractive enough to Washington to pry away Lane Thomas.\n\nPaul Hoynes (09:32):\n\nYeah, we were talking about it yesterday, Joe, if you make a good deal, if you make a trade, it should hurt both sides. Now, I don’t know how much this hurt Washington, but I think he was a fan. Thomas was a fan favorite over there. The people really liked him. He played a great right field. He had a ton of assist over the last two years, but they’re kind of rebuilding. They’re headed in a different direction with Cleveland, we all know how they treasure their prospects. They paid Clemy a $2.3 million signing bonus last year, went over slot to keep him from going to college. So that shows you how much they thought of him. And Tania, I loved the way Tania was swinging the bat at Columbus. 17 doubles, 17 home runs. He’s not a real big guy, but he has some pop. So yeah, I mean I think they had to give something to get something\n\nJoe Noga (10:30):\n\nAnd really sending these guys to Washington, not making a deal within the division as a lot of people were looking at some of the names that were available from teams like Chicago or the White Sox and Detroit. You’re not sending a guy out who will come back to bite you 13 times a year in the division. It’s just you might see him once a year in a three game series with the balance schedule. So it doesn’t hurt in that way as sort of a reminder. But if Clemy or if Tenna or if Ramirez, go on and find success, that’s okay as long as Lane Thomas comes in and does what you’re hoping that he’ll be able to come in and do.\n\nPaul Hoynes (11:16):\n\nYeah, even if Lane Thomas is only here for what through 2025, if he helps you get to the postseason this year, make a good run in the postseason, perhaps you’re able to sign him to a multi-year deal next year and he becomes a fixture in right field. I mean he gives you some stability in that right field spot. So that’s all you can ask for. That’s what you’re trading for right now. You’re trading for immediate help right now against what may or may not be immediate help. I mean help down the road for the nationals.\n\nJoe Noga (12:00):\n\nWe saw a couple of names come off the board in terms of trade candidates that might’ve fit for the guardians. Eric, Ty being the big one, he went to St. Louis. We also saw Jack Flaherty get pulled out of his start against Cleveland last night and the speculation was he would be traded at some point in the very near future. That still could happen before six o’clock. But it helped the guardians because they didn’t have to face Jack Flaherty who’d been pretty tough on him this year in last night’s game. Last night’s game, of course eight to four, the guardians come out and win Jose Ramirez with a big two home run game. Just basically Jose Ramirez going out there and doing Jose Ramirez things, three extra base hits gets the offense started with a double in the first inning. Tanner Bibe gives him six pretty strong innings, gets a little tired there in the seventh inning, gives up a couple of runs. But in general, overall, that was pretty much how the guardians were hoping that last night’s game would go.\n\nPaul Hoynes (13:07):\n\nYeah, they finally beat the tires on a bullpen game. A bullpen game. I don’t think that was really planned by Detroit, but Joe, I’m still expecting to see Flaherty walk across a diamond sometime today and put on a Cleveland uniform. I that’s, I think that would top now that would make a good haul before the trade deadline.\n\nJoe Noga (13:31):\n\nYeah, if they’re able to do that, they absolutely win the trade deadline with moves like that. Bringing in a guy like a Jack Flaherty as a rental would be the ideal situation for Cleveland last night’s game, Jose Ramirez, 451 foot home run in his second at bat off of Detroit rookie, Brian Salmons, who was making his major league debut in Relief. Salmon goes on to pitch seven and a third innings the most relief innings for a Tiger’s rookie in a debut since 2002. Andy Hecker against Cleveland also back then. So really Sam’s did a nice job, still gave up five runs bone Nailer, adds a three run home run of his own. Later on in the game, the offense looks like it responded to this sort of trade deadline situation. Maybe the trade sort of released some pressure. The pressure valve is open as the guardians headers go up to the plate thinking, Hey, we’ve got to relax because the front office is making moves.\n\nPaul Hoynes (14:56):\n\nWhat Josh Naer back in the lineup for the first time since before last weekend after sitting against the Phillies, he gets two hits. He gets a single right out of the box in the first thinning. Paul Naer, like you said, hits what a three run Homer in the sixth. And then of course, like you were saying, Joe Ramirez always seems to save his best for the Tigers and those two home runs tied him with kind of an important slugger in Cleveland history.\n\nJoe Noga (15:29):\n\nYeah, he’s number two on the list right now with tied with Bell 242 career home runs. Every time Jose has a game like he did last night, we can just rattle off the list of categories and all time lists that he has been climbing for Cleveland next on the list, Jim Tomi, he’s 95 home runs away from becoming Cleveland’s all time home run leader. Again, the trajectory that Jose Ramirez is on, if he continues the way has been for the last decade. By the time all is said and done, he’s going to own every record in Cleveland baseball history or at least be top two or three in every category.\n\nPaul Hoynes (16:16):\n\nAnd he’s doing it the hard way. Joe, listen to these numbers. Bell hit his 242 home runs in 913 games. Tony hit his 337 home runs with Cleveland in 1,399 games. Jose’s hit 2 42 in 1,396 games. So if he’s going to catch Tony, it’s not going to come easy. He’s going to have to play every day and kind of grind it out as he has his whole career in Cleveland.\n\nJoe Noga (16:47):\n\nAnd you talk about two different players or two sort of different personalities or different in stature. Albert Bell and Jose Ramirez can’t have been more different in the way they approach the game, and yet these guys had the same number of home runs for Cleveland.\n\nPaul Hoynes (17:07):\n\nAlbert Bell just was, well, he played with those great Cleveland teams in the 1990s. He was the focal point of that lineup, that lineup that just terrified hitters. And he was Darth Vader in that lineup. He was Darth Vader. The rest of that lineup was like the Beatles, and he was Darth Vader in the middle of that lineup because he scared everyone, not just the opposition but his own teammates. And Jose is just one of those guys that just fits into the lineup. He is going to be there every day. He doesn’t say boo, he doesn’t bother anybody. He’s a switch hitter. You can’t platoon him. He just shows up every day. He plays gold glove defense, but at the same time, the offense revolves around him, just like those 1990s teams that their offense revolved around Bell.\n\nJoe Noga (18:05):\n\nSo what does that make Jose? Yoda, I mean Yoda. Yeah, but I mean we saw\n\nPaul Hoynes (18:12):\n\nAbout the ears.\n\nJoe Noga (18:14):\n\nYeah. Okay. But I mean if I really want to do a nerdy deep dive here, I could just tell you how in the prequel series, Yoda actually busts out the lights saber and he’s jumping all over the place and spinning and jumping. That’s more Jose like than the decrepit Yoda that we saw in Empire Strikes Back. But the nerds can follow me on Twitter. I’ll post more about that later. As far as today’s game, obviously you’ve got Gavin Williams going for The Guardians. The Tigers still haven’t announced a starter. It won’t be Flaherty, we know that for sure. But getting out of Detroit with a two game sweep sort of stunning the Tigers in the final two meetings of the season and just sort of punching them in the mouth that way would be nice. Going into an off day for the Guardians.\n\nPaul Hoynes (19:06):\n\nYeah, the Tigers looked a little deflated to me, Joe, after they take Flaherty out of the rotation, he’s not going to start. They know he’s getting traded. It was kind of like the white flag going up in the Detroit clubhouse and they kind came out that way. Cleveland jumped right on him and the game was over in the first inning. I had that feeling. But this is a tough Tiger team. I think it would be great if they could come out beat ‘em tonight. You’re coming off that big weekend in Philly where you took two out of three and like you said, Joe, then you’ve got some momentum going into the off day and then you’ve got a really, really tough home stand with Baltimore and Arizona.\n\nJoe Noga (19:51):\n\nYeah, it should be a fun and interesting weekend, but to get there first, you got to get through a pesky Detroit team is a good way of putting it. Steven v walked by us in the hallway outside the Guardian’s clubhouse yesterday, and he said one of the things he’s fond of saying is, there’s no bad days in major league baseball. There’s only good days in great days. And he said, you know what? It take today from a good day to a great day, a three spot in the first inning. And sure enough, they go out and they get, we’re sort of counting them down in the press box. We’re looking at each other going, well, there’s one run, there’s two runs. They got to the third run and we all just sort of looked at each other and said, wait, did he know something? Did he leap the script there before the game?\n\n(20:36):\n\nWhat was going on? It was just really interesting vote came out and he said, three runs in the first will get us going. And sure enough they did. So if only it were that easy, hoey, if only it were that easy. As we approach the trade deadline, we will be on high alert for the next few hours here in Detroit and we will bring you all of the action and all the results as we find them out with the guardians and their approach to the trade deadline. We’ll talk to you again tomorrow on the off day and we’ll check in with you then. Good deal, Joe.\n\nGot a question you want answered on the podcast?
