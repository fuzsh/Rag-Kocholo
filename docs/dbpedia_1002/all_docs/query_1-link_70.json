        "text": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Guardians addressed their sometimes sputtering offense ahead of the trade deadline.\n\nWhile they continue to scour the market to bolster their starting rotation, the AL Central leaders acquired experienced outfielder Lane Thomas from the Washington Nationals on Monday in exchange for three prospects.\n\n“Versatile outfielder, a guy that’s capable of playing center field, right field and to contribute offensively, defensively and on the bases,” Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said in Detroit after Cleveland’s 8-4 win.\n\nCleveland sent minor league left-hander Alex Clemmey to the Nationals along with infielders José Tena and Rafael Ramirez Jr. for the 28-year-old Thomas, who is batting .253 in 77 games this season.\n\nThomas has a $5.45 million salary, is eligible for arbitration next winter and can become a free agent after the 2025 World Series. He can immediately help the Guardians, who have been rotating several young players in right field. He also gives the Guardians some speed and a defensive presence.\n\nDespite leading their division most of the season, the Guardians have struggled to score since before the All-Star break. They’ve been shut out since times since July 8, and recently went through a stretch in which they scored two runs or fewer in eight of 12 games.\n\nIt’s been a long time since the Guardians had stability in right field. Will Brennan had held the starting job before he was slowed by injury and Cleveland has used rookies Angel Martínez and Jhonkensy Noel in right.\n\nThomas might also fit in the No. 2 spot behind leadoff hitter Steven Kwan and ahead of All-Stars José Ramírez and Josh Naylor.\n\nThomas is third in the NL with 28 steals and his 24 outfield assists since the start of last season are the most in the major leagues. He has eight homers, 40 RBIs and has reached base in 25 straight games, the longest active streak in the majors.\n\nCleveland is one of several contenders looking for a starter before Tuesday’s 6 p.m. EDT trade deadline.\n\n“We’re definitely not done pursuing things,” Antonetti said. “Whether or not that leads to another deal or more deals, it’s really hard to forecast, but we’ll continue to try to be active and see if there are other opportunities.”\n\nThomas was drafted by Toronto in 2014. He was traded to St. Louis in 2017 and appeared in 84 games for the Cardinals from 2019-21, then was dealt to Washington for left-hander Jon Lester.\n\nIn four seasons with the Nationals, Thomas batted .257 with 60 homers, 205 RBIs and 60 stolen bases.\n\nClemmey, 19, was a second-round pick by Cleveland last season, and considered one of its top pitching prospects.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Clemmey went 1-4 with a 4.67 ERA in 19 starts for Class A Lynchburg. He struck out 97 in 69 1/3 innings and held opponents to a .214 average.\n\nTena made his major league debut with the Guardians last season. He currently leads Cleveland’s minor league system with 110 hits, and the 23-year-old is second with 17 homers and 63 RBIs. He had 14 steals at Triple-A Columbus.\n\nTena can play shortstop, second base and third.\n\nRamirez, 19, is playing in his first full minor league season and is hitting .187 in 54 games.\n\n“We gave up three players that we think have a chance to go out and have bright futures,” Antonetti said. “It’s painful to make deals like this, but this was one we felt we had to make.”\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
