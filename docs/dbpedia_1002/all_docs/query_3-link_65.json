        "text": "All four of the police officers involved in George Floyd’s death during his arrest in Minneapolis last week have now been charged, as widespread protests continue across the US.\n\nThe four officers had been fired, but Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Mr Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes, had previously been the only person involved in the killing to be charged. His charge has now been elevated to second-degree murder.\n\nSecond wave unlikely – but expect a ‘bump’ in cases, says scientist\n\nVulnerable Britons left confused by sudden changes to shielding rules\n\nThe current lockdown rules in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland explained\n\nWho can book a coronavirus test under new UK rules\n\nNHS Test and Trace: How UK contact tracing system works\n\nThe three other officers at the scene – Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFloyd ‘should be here’\n\nThe new charges were sought by Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison, who called the protests triggered by Mr Floyd’s death “dramatic and necessary”, adding that the 46-year-old “should be here and he is not”.\n\n“His life had value, and we will seek justice,” said Mr Ellison, who warned that getting convictions would be hard and that the public pressure could not impact his decisions.\n\nHundreds of protesters were in New York City’s Washington Square Park when the charges were announced.\n\nBenjamin Crump, a lawyer for Mr Floyd’s family, called it “a bittersweet moment” and “a significant step forward on the road to justice”.\n\nMr Crump said Mr Ellison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Mr Floyd’s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted.\n\nOngoing protests\n\nOn Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office released the full autopsy report on Mr Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for Covid-19, but was apparently asymptomatic.\n\nThe report was released with the family’s permission after summary findings on Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers.\n\nSome of the rockiness of the days since Mr Floyd’s death on 25 May dissipated on Tuesday night, with demonstrations continuing around the country, but without major reports of violence.\n\nCurfews and efforts by protesters to contain earlier flare-ups of lawlessness were credited with preventing more widespread damage to businesses in New York and other cities overnight.\n\n“Last night we took a step forward in moving out of this difficult period we’ve had the last few days and moving to a better time,” New York mayor Bill de Blasio said.\n\nNew York police said they arrested about 280 people on protest-related charges on Tuesday night, compared with 700 a day earlier.\n\nNationwide, the number arrested in connection to the unrest rose to more than 9,000.\n\nAt least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being clarified.\n\nAdditional reporting from Press Association"
