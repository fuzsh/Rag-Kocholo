        "text": "As everyone has said a member got fired for having grass on him through an airport (which he has said since he did on purpose as he needed to get caught). He did a documentary on Channel 4 a few months back where they followed him through drug rehab, dont know if anyone saw it, he was big big into drugs.\n\nThey got dropped. The girls formed a band called Sisters of something like that, nothing came of that.\n\nThey then reformed as Big Brovaz with the guy who used to take drugs but is now clean. One of the guys refused to come back so they went on without him. They released Hangin' Around which sampled Rainy Days and Mondays by the Carpenters in May 2006 and that flopped so now its anyones guess but no doubt they will vanish.\n\nShame as they were ok when they first came about\n\n0"
