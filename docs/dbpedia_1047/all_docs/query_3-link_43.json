        "text": "Ending the ‘R&B is dead’ conversation once and for all… Why do some argue R&B is dead when there are many signs it’s thriving?\n\nIt feels like every few months, there’s a Twitter / social media row over whether or not R&B is dead. After Diddy brought the conversation back in summer 2022, over on our TikTok, we shared the video below recently to address the question that just won’t quite go away.\n\nIt’s no secret that we’re massively towards R&B and Soul music. And as stans of the genre, we are excited by the evolution that, R&B in particular, has made over time to its current state in 2024. While some say R&B barely exists anymore, others say its time has passed. But we believe that R&B music continues to be in its prime, evolving in the most exciting ways. So what’s the state of play? Can R&B / Soul in 2024 be said to be thriving or is it ‘dead’?\n\nDiddy & the ‘R&B is Dead’ debate\n\nOne of the most recent flare ups of the public debate on whether or not “R&B is dead” came about in 2022 when Diddy declared it was dead. In a live with producer, Timbaland, he emphatically declared “R&B is dead”. In a follow up Breakfast Club interview, he explained that the genre has become too focused on “sampling and remixing old records” and had lost the emotional depth and authenticity that defined classic R&B. Diddy’s comments sparked a lively debate among music fans and critics, with some agreeing that R&B had lost its way and others arguing that the genre was alive and well.\n\nOver here in the UK, the fate of R&B has been much debated. Most recently this happened when the BRITS failed to nominate any R&B acts in the Best Pop / R&B category, after merging two very different genres. We spoke to Vice about this unfortunate situation over here.\n\nThe Argument for R&B’s Demise\n\nOne of the main criticisms of contemporary R&B is that it has become too focused on production and technology, with artists relying heavily on autotune and other digital effects to achieve a polished sound.\n\nAnother criticism of contemporary R&B is that it has become too homogenized, with many artists producing music that sounds similar to one another. Critics argue that this lack of diversity and originality has contributed to the genre’s decline in popularity and cultural relevance.\n\nAnother theory that pops up a fair bit is the R&B doesn’t even really exist anymore. This was the thought expressed in February 2020 by rapper Young M.A. M.A. tweeted “Music don’t feel the same because we barely have R&B, … R&B brung that balance to music.. now everything is leanin one way smh so it gets played out quick! We need R&B for the balance no kap!”\n\nMusic don’t feel the same because we barely have R&B, … R&B brung that balance to music.. now everything is leanin one way smh so it gets played out quick! We need R&B for the balance no kap!\n\n— Young M.A (@YoungMAMusic) February 24, 2020\n\nThe Argument for R&B in 2024\n\nDespite these criticisms, there are many reasons to believe that R&B is not dead, but rather evolving and flourishing in new and exciting ways.\n\nWe must, of course, take exception to the view shared by the likes of Diddy and Young M.A. We have many a playlist to definitively prove there’s a lot of exceptional R&B music out there. No, it doesn’t sound the same as it did in the ’90s and ’00s. Why would it? Good music is supposed to be progressive – to move the sound of music forward. But still, there’s no denying that there is plenty of music steeped in the roots and sounds of R&B. It has simply evolved for the times, borrowing from modern influences and genres. Contemporary R&B is rich and diverse.\n\nThe Diversity and Range of Contemporary R&B\n\nIn 2024, the genre’s spectrum is at the height of its evolution and is more diverse than ever before! There’s an array of artists delivering quality tunes influenced by a mix of sounds, whilst simultaneously drawing from the soulful heart of R&B. We explore the main sub-genres of R&B today here but even these house a vide array of sounds and artists.\n\nFrom more ‘mainstream’ contemporary R&B (Sza & Summer Walker), to Neo-Soul (Cleo Sol, Ari Lennox, SiR), to R&B with electronic influences (Kelela, KAYTRANADA, Sampha). Contemporary / modern Jazz is also a current sound being weaved into R&B, through the likes of Ego Ella May and Theo Crocker. Furthermore, Alternative R&B (Ojerime, Ravyn Lenae, Q) and Indie Soul (SAULT, Hiatus Kaiyote) are taking R&B into new waters.\n\nMoreover, this trend of expansion of the sound of Soul music is only likely to continue. Across genres, artists are increasingly genre-bending and fusing, refusing the traditional confines of genre. In our opinion, this is what music is supposed to do – evolve in rich, unconventional ways. Gen-Z especially has eschewed genre so those looking for R&B that feels just like it used to are unlikely to.\n\nThe generational divide\n\nIn fact it often feels like this is at the core of the debate here. Older R&B fans who are unable to invest time in music discovery looking for popular music that sounds like the R&B they love. As R&B and music / media in general has become increasingly fragmented, this is harder to find. As a result, they reach the conclusion that R&B is dead. But in reality, R&B is not dead, it simply sounds different from the 90s/00s, as with other genres. The sound of R&B, as with all other culturally relevant genres, has evolved over time. And yes, it isn’t sitting at the top of the charts as much as it once did.\n\nYet creatively and culturally, R&B is thriving in the so-called ‘underground’. And it is popular across age groups. Indeed R&B is reported to be the most popular genre after Hip Hop / Rap among Gen Z.\n\nA sidenote on commercial success and R&B\n\nR&B was wildly popular in mainstream music in the early 00’s. To some, that was the last time this was so. Nearing 2010, several pioneers of R&B transitioned to other genres for a while, including dance music, and a version of Pop that drew from R&B and Hip Hop. Think Usher’s DJ’s Got Us Falling In Love Again and Chris Brown’s Look At Me Now / Beautiful People.\n\nAlthough R&B does not dominate the charts like it used to, there are wildly successful commercial artists, who are either explicitly R&B or very much owe musical inspiration to the genre. Childish Gambino, Solange, Ella Mai, SZA, Frank Ocean, Jorja Smith and H.E.R. Also, Bryson Tiller’s debut album, Trap Soul, incorporates heavy Trap, whilst also being truly R&B. This personifies how the genre has developed to encapsulate variety over time.\n\nFrank Ocean, for example, is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential R&B artists of the past decade, thanks to his unique blend of experimental sounds, introspective lyrics, and soulful vocals. His 2012 album, Channel Orange received widespread critical acclaim and was certified platinum. His 2016 Blonde was even more so, cementing his status as a mainstream cult favourite. So much so that in 2023, he headlined, arguably, the world’s most prestigious festival stage, Coachella.\n\nThe renaissance of R&B in the mainstream – SZA, Summer Walker, Steve lacy\n\nIn addition to Frank Ocean, several other contemporary R&B artists have achieved ‘mainstream’ commercial success in the past few years. R&B is having a commercial renaissance or comeback.\n\nSZA\n\nSZA’s debut album, Ctrl, was released in 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. Ctrl debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 and earned a platinum certification. But SZA’s 2022 SOS is a monster success, it sat at the top of the Billboard 200 for over 8 weeks. SOS also spawned several hits and currently sits at the top of the albums chart for 18 weeks.\n\nSummer Walker\n\nSummer Walker is another artist who has made waves in the R&B scene in recent years, thanks to her soulful vocals and introspective lyrics. Walker’s debut album, Over It, was released in 2019 and quickly became a commercial and critical success, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200 and earning a platinum certification. Her 2021 follow-up, Still Over It, claimed the #1 spot. Still Over It also made a record as the most successful streaming debut week for an R&B artist at the time.\n\nSteve Lacy\n\nSteve Lacy is yet another example. An R&B artist and producer, who has gained a following for his innovative and experimental sound. Lacy first gained prominence as a member of the alternative R&B band, The Internet, before launching a solo career in 2017. His debut album, Gemini Rights is a delightful blend of funk, R&B, Rock and Pop influences. His breakout single, Bad Habits, peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThese artists, along with many others, demonstrate that R&B is far from dead. In fact it is thriving in new and exciting ways. Artists continue to push the boundaries of the genre and explore new sonic and lyrical territory. And notably, its paying off commercially.\n\nThis is in fact true in more ways than one. R&B is at the root of the success of a lot of today’s pop music. In terms of the sounds many of the most successful pop albums look for inspiration. But also in terms of the songwriters and producers at the helm of making the most successful music out.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, with all of this being said, the question stands is R&B dead in 2024? The simple answer is of course ‘NO’. We can conclude that in many ways, traditional R&B / Soul has given way to a super-genre with several sub-genres that draw from the richness of the traditional sound. R&B is richer in diversity. However sweet melodies, rhythm and the indescribable essence of Soul remains at its core. This diversity, as well as, the commercial success of artists like SZA and Steve Lacy, demonstrates that R&B is far from dead.\n\nAt The Blues Project, we love the full tapestry of modern R&B and Soul. From Alternative R&B, Neo-Soul and other sounds inspiring the artists under these categories. We are here for all modern forms of R&B and Soul music. We stan them all!"
