        "text": "Since 2017, Fender Play has been helping musicians learn new songs and skills. In addition to Rock, Pop, Country, Folk, and Blues; R&B / Soul is now a Fender Play Path that musicians can follow to discover how to play the music within one of their favorite genres.\n\nWhether youâre a fan of classic R&B / Soul legends like Aretha Franklin or Curtis Mayfield, or more enraptured by Neo-Soul artists like Alicia Keys and modern R&B singer-songwriters like H.E.R., Fender Play helps you to learn to play their music at your own pace with bite-sized lessons. In addition to learning to play some of your favorite R&B / Soul songs, youâll also learn many of the techniques that give this genre its unique flavor.\n\nThe new R&B / Soul path is broken into five different levels, helping guitarists learn fundamentals first before expanding their musical education. Taught by experienced instructors who have played with some of the top names in Soul and R&B, youâll learn from the best in a way thatâs easily accessible to players of all levels, and have a chance to put that knowledge to the test in a variety of songs.\n\nStart learning to play R&B / Soul with Fender Play.\n\nLearn More About Classic Soul and R&B\n\nBoth Soul and R&B have a rich musical history. Both have played a role in influencing popular music and also have a long lineage connecting them to even older musical genres. Both Soul and R&B, like Blues, speak to what it means to be alive â to struggle, to love and lose, as well as the triumph of the human spirit. While Blues speaks to what it means to feel downtrodden, Soul and R&B donât ignore those feelings, but also uplift and celebrate life without sugar coating it.\n\nSimilarities and Differences Between Soul and R&B Music\n\nSoul and R&B are two distinct, yet related genres, laying the foundation for American music and influencing other genres. R&B is the abbreviated name for ârhythm and blues,â originating within Black communities and blending Jazz, Blues, and later Afro-Cuban rhythms.\n\nIts mix of rollicking uptempo and winding sensuality made R&B such a hit and influential force in popular music. Over time, classic R&B morphed into what is now known as âContemporary R&B,â merging the genre with funk, soul, and hip hop.\n\nSoul also has its roots in the African-American community, and was heavily steeped in gospel music at its start, weaving in elements of jazz and merging with R&B â turning it into a more secular and less spirituality-based genre. Motown Records became one of the premiere labels to catapult Soul into the mainstream, typified by layered vocal harmonies.\n\nWhile the Motown sound of Detroit was key to the Soul music movement, there were countless other styles of soul ranging from southern Memphis soul punctuated by the sound of a Hammond organ to horn-peppered Philadelphia soul. Classic soul also gave way to merge with funk and other genres in the â70s. In keeping with that evolution, today, the eclectic Neo Soul movement continues to push boundaries and bend genres into something fresh, unique, and continually experimental.\n\nR&B and Soul Guitar Techniques and Skills\n\nLearning to play Soul and R&B is ideal for guitarists who either want to sing as they play, with chord changes signaling emotional shifts in a song and playing around with tempo, or focus more on the intricacies of rhythm and apply various techniques.\n\nWhile rock and punk may rely on simple power chords and guitar solos, rhythm guitar is the backbone of Soul and R&B. Many classic Soul and R&B hits made use of piano and organ â however, those chords translate just as well to guitar.\n\nSoul and R&B songs tend to use more chords than other paths â giving guitarists opportunities to learn and play rich chord voicings, such as 7th chords and suspended chords â also known as sus chords. Sus chords omit certain notes from a standard major chord, transforming that chord in a way that either gives it a zingier brightness or adds dimension to music. Similarly, 7th chords also add tension to music â allowing the music to truly tell a story, one of the hallmarks of the Soul and R&B genres.\n\nBy learning to play different chord voicings, guitarists of all levels can add more punch to their playing and deepen knowledge of their instrument.\n\nBut learning to play Soul and R&B involves more than just chords. There are various techniques that amp up the rhythm aspect of R&B. Palm muting, percussive strumming, and accented strumming are just a few of the techniques youâll pick up when you plug in and start down this path.\n\nClassic R&B and Soul Artists: Learn to Play the Greats on Guitar\n\nBoth Soul and R&B share a common lineage and are close cousins even in their more modern incarnations. Learning about the artists who put Soul and R&B on the map can give you a firm foundation in Americaâs own musical history â pulling from blues and jazzâs influence on Soul and R&B pioneers, who, in turn, inspired many of todayâs top artists\n\nIf youâre learning to play Soul and R&B, you canât go wrong with the classics. Start your education by grounding yourself in the songs of Sam Cooke â sometimes referred to as the King of Soul. An ideal song for beginners to learn, Cookeâs âBring It On Home to Meâ uses easy chords for beginners, including the G, C, and D major chords, and is perfect for learning to sing along while strumming. For a more challenging piece from the soul legendâs catalog, intermediate and more advanced guitarists can try their hand at playing âTwistinâ the Night Away.â Cookeâs 1962 classic still uses the G, C, and D major chords â but are also joined by another mainstay, the E Minor (Em) chord. The more rhythmic elements of soul and R&B guitar playing can be heard on this song, making use of string muting and backbeat strumming for a more percussive feel.\n\nSam Cooke had a profound influence on many of the performers of his day. Dubbed the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, got her start singing Gospel at her fatherâs church, but cited Cooke as one of her influences during the early years of her career. With a powerful voice that commanded âRespect,â Arethaâs career spanned nearly 60 years. From her debut in 1960, to her 1980s resurgence with such hits as âWhoâs Zoominâ Whoâ and âFreeway of Loveâ all the way into the 21st century with her reinterpretations of other pop artist tunes, Aretha Franklin put her stamp on not just Soul, but countless other genres. In addition to her instantly recognizable vocals, Aretha was also a talented pianist.\n\nAnother influence on Aretha Franklin was singer / pianist Ray Charles, whose memorable âWhatâd I Sayâ features a pack of 7th chords â a mainstay of Soul and R&B.\n\nNo education in classic Soul and R&B would be complete without paying homage to the Godfather of Soul himself, James Brown. While his high octane brand of soul was flavored with horns, James Brownâs band played host to some of the most innovative guitarists in the R&B and funk landscape, including Nafloyd Scott, Phelps âCatfishâ Collins (brother of legendary bassist Bootsie Collins), and Jimmy Nolen to name a few.\n\nLearn to Play â70s Soul, Neo Soul, and Contemporary R&B\n\nBerry Gordyâs Motown Records became a driving force of music during the 1960s, giving a hefty dose of the signature Detroit sound with vocal harmonies. This spilled over into the â70s, with Motown launching the careers of such artists as the Jackson 5 and Stevie Wonder who staked their claim in the converging worlds of Soul and R&B.\n\nAlthough Stevie Wonder began his career in the â60s, he truly came into his own and was a driving force in propelling the new sound of Soul and R&B to the forefront of popular music in the â70s, releasing a string of albums that highlighted his innovative songwriting style â including Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. Even when he was covering songs written by other artists, such as âFor Once In My Life,â Stevie Wonder put his own unique stamp on them, changing the tempo and making songs more soulful by way of incorporating unexpected chords.\n\nAs the call for social change grew stronger, so did that voice in music. Artists like Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye wove calls for justice into the fabric of their songs. Mayfieldâs inspirational âMove On Upâ makes great use of chord anticipation and swiftly switching between chords. On the flipside, his gritty âPushermanâ from the film Super Fly, offers guitarists more of a chance to play some tasty leads, complete with string bends.\n\nMarvin Gaye also became one of the most recognizable voices in Soul and R&B, with the sexy âLetâs Get It Onâ heightening the mood with chord anticipation alongside a simple progression. Gaye also touched on such (still relevant) social issues in âMercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)â and âWhatâs Going Onâ, making use of syncopated strumming and alternate strumming alongside several 7th and Sus chords.\n\nAs with any genre, Soul and R&B evolved throughout the â80s, â90s, and all the way into the 21st century. Contemporary R&B and Neo Soul artists like Alicia Keys, Amerie, and H.E.R. continue to fly the flag â breathing new life into the genre, continuing its evolution while still staying true to its roots.\n\nAlicia Keys' soulful vocals and piano are an ideal springboard for guitarists to reinterpret in their own way. Built around an Em chord, âFallinââ is a great song for beginners to learn, taking it slow, sensual and easy with a half-note strum throughout. For intermediate players who want a chance to strut their chord knowledge, Alicia Keysâ âIf I Ainât Got Youâ incorporates a handful of 7th chords for an old school throwback sound to classic R&B with more of a modern edge. While Keys uses this technique on piano, guitarists have a chance to learn the traditional walk-up and walk-down technique that delivers a cool, winding feel.\n\nSinger-songwriter H.E.R. is yet another modern R&B / Soul artist whose prolific work â despite only having exploded onto the scene in 2016. Influenced by Aretha Franklin and Alicia Keys, H.E.R. is a multi-instrumentalist, whose knowledge of piano, guitar, and percussion â on top of her distinctive vocals â makes her a dynamic force in modern music, bridging an appreciation for classic Soul and R&B with a modern edge. Songs like âI Canât Breatheâ call to mind the social consciousness and battle cry for justice of Marvin Gaye, while H.E.R.âs wistful âCouldâve Beenâ tinkers around with unexpected chords that pack an emotional wallop in this song.\n\nStart Playing More R&B and Soul Songs with Fender Play"
