        "text": "Stepback! 90’s vs 00’s featuring:\n\nFive, S Club, Atomic Kitten, Fatman Scoop, Shayne Ward, Blazin’ Squad, Big Brovaz, Booty Luv, 911\n\nTwo massive decades in music will go head to head in the ultimate arena tour at the Brighton Centre on 29th November. Stepback! 90’s Vs 00’s is the ultimate clash of the titans as acts from two iconic decades go head-to-head on stage in the ultimate throwback night! Tickets go on general sale on Friday 12th April at 9am from HERE.\n\nEverybody loves a comeback, and there is no return to the pop universe more triumphant than the return of these nine bands. They sound-tracked the pop explosion of the late nineties and noughties and now they are returning, to do it all again – but bigger and bolder than ever before. Pop is back in a big way, so sound the nostalgia gong and lets get the party well and truly started!\n\nPromoter James Penny said:\n\n“The appetite for nostalgia has never been stronger, and we are thrilled to present this full on throwback fest across UK Arenas this autumn! This tour promises to be a massive hit. It will be a glamorous, action-packed extravaganza with no skimping on the sequins or dance moves. Stepback! 90’s Vs 00’s is going to be unmissable for any pop fan – a retro party like never before!! We are excited to add more dates to the tour! The demand has been amazing! ”\n\nSince winning the UK X Factor in 2005 Shayne Ward has released three albums, played London’s O2 Arena, sold over 3 million albums, achieved a staggering 14 Platinum discs, had number one albums in 9 countries, rocked West End audiences and ice-skated back onto Saturday night TV. Shayne is, still to this date, the most successful solo male X Factor winner. Shane made an emotional departure from Coronation Street earlier in the year after his character Aidan Connor tragically ended his own life. He’s now focusing on a range of film and music projects and makes a welcome return to the stage!\n\nAtomic Kitten remain one of Europe’s most-loved groups. From the moment they burst onto the scene with their debut single ‘Right Now’, the girls have been wowing audiences around the world, picking up awards and becoming the first all girl group to hit No.1 in the singles, albums and DVD charts simultaneously. With a string of No.1 and Top Ten hits, top band awards, Atomic Kitten have become synonymous with fun and some of the best pop tunes of a generation. Party like it’s 1999 to smash hits ‘Whole Again’ and ‘Eternal Flame’!\n\n5ive are the British boy band who dominated the charts – and the hearts of their adoring fans – during the 90’s. Back in the day British boy band 5ive had everyone ‘getting down’. The heartthrobs topped the pop charts with hits like ‘Slam Dunk (Da Funk)’, ‘When the Lights Go Out’, ‘Everybody Get Up’, ‘If Ya Gettin’ Down’, and ‘Keep On Movin’’. Their perfect harmonies, heartfelt lyrics and approachable, laddish personalities helped them build a huge fan-base who still come out on force to support the guys whenever they perform.\n\nLet’s face it there ain’t no party like an S Club party! The group originally formed back in 1998 by Spice Girls Manager Simon Fuller topped the charts with hit singles such as: ‘Bring It All Back’, ‘Never Had A Dream Come True’, ‘Don’t Stop Movin’, ‘Have You Ever’ and ‘Reach’. S Club 7 took over the world of pop and television, with chart-topping records over 20 years ago. 90 million people viewed their TV show and the UK still loves them so! In our hearts and minds, Tina’s still doing her dance, Jon’s found romance, Paul’s gettin’ down on some floor and Hannah’s happily screaming for more, while Bradley’s swinging, Rachel’s doing her thing and Jo definitely still has the flow.\n\nFatman Scoop is notorious for shouting his name and requesting that you do whatever he tells you… so put your damn hands up! Whether it’s Scoop’s rambunctious baritone hyping a track or video cameos for P.Diddy, 50 Cent, or David Guetta Scoop’s booming voice, catchy hooks, electrifying energy and charismatic presence never go unnoticed. Get ready to “make some noise” as the man responsible for early Noughties mega hit Be Faithful makes a return to the stage. “You got a 50-dollar bill, get ya hands up,” “Single ladies, I can’t hear y’all,” “Single ladies, make noise!”\n\nThey hit the big time back in 2002 and 16 years later Blazin’ Squad are making the ultimate comeback. Noughties hip-hop legends Blazin’ Squad were propelled back to fame after the arrival of Marcel aka Rocky B on 2017’s Love Island. And one thing is for sure; the UK has rediscovered the need to Flip Reverse things every now and again. Back in 2002 even music snobs were hard-pressed to resist the pop charm of the teen band’s chart-topping debut single ‘Crossroads’. ‘Flip Reverse’ also holds huge nostalgic charm for many.And now, the multi-million selling Blazin’ Squad are back!\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, Boys and girls, It is my pleasure to introduce to you all ….. the return of Big Brovaz. MOBO Award winners Big Brovaz were an acclaimed R&B group from London. The band hit the ground running quickly clocking up plenty of fans and playing tours around Europe with the group’s biggest single ‘Nu Flow’, becoming a huge hit all around Europe making the top 3 in the UK while remaining in the top 75 for four months. Get ready as Big Bro take over the show once again!\n\nBooty Luv were the duo behind smash hit ‘Boogie 2nite’. The track spent a whopping 23 weeks inside the UK Top 75. Featuring dual lead vocals from former Big Brovaz members Cherise Roberts and Nadia Shepherd, Boogie 2nite was and still is a huge club anthem. Signed to dance label Hed Kandi, the duo followed up that success with a second single, a cover of Luther Vandross’ ‘Shine’, and dance hit ‘Some Kinda Rush’.\n\nGet your body shakin’, 911 are making a come back! It’s over 20 years since they released that crazy, knee-swinging track ‘Bodyshakin’, and the boys are ready to do it all over again. The band were formed in 1995 and scored their first Top Ten hit in May 1996 with the single ‘Don’t Make Me Wait’. 9 more successive hits followed including Top 5 singles ‘More Than A Woman’, their massive signature anthem ‘Bodyshakin’ and their first UK number one ‘A Little Bit More’.\n\nStepback 90’s vs 00’s – will take place at the Brighton Centre on Friday 29th November 2019 and tickets go on general sale on Friday 12th April at 9am from the Brighton Centre Box Office: 0844 8471515 / www.brightoncentre.co.uk\n\nMore information on the other Stepback! 90’s vs 00’s UK tour dates and tickets HERE."
