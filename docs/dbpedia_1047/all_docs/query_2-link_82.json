Big Brovaz aint had a top 10 hit for 3 years now and aint even had a top 40 single for 2 years now so i can only see this single as a good thing as its tipped for top 10 , mabey even top 5 and will get some interest for the band again\n\nScOtty2oo6 said:\n\nthe girls are still part of big brovaz , its just a side project to try get some interest in big brovaz again before the launch of their new comeback big brovaz thang which is their best thing in years , plus they've still got this delayed 2nd album planned for 2007 which has been due for a couple of years now.
