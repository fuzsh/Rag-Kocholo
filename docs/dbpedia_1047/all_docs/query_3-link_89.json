        "text": "Rhythm and blues Stylistic origins Jazz\n\nBlues (esp. electric)\n\nTrad pop\n\nGospel Cultural origins 1940s United States Typical instruments Guitar - Bass - Harmonica - Trumpet - Saxophone - Drum kit - Piano - Organ - Keyboard Derivative forms Contemporary R&B - Reggae - Ska - Rock and roll - Funk Subgenres Doo wop Fusion genres Soul music - Rockabilly\n\nRhythm and blues (also known as R&B or RnB) is a popular music genre combining jazz, gospel, and blues influences, first performed by African American artists. It is now performed worldwide by people of many cultures and ethnic groups.\n\nWriter/producer Robert Palmer defined \"rhythm & blues as a catchall term referring to any music that was made by and for black Americans.\" He has used the term R&B as a synonym for jump blues. Lawrence Cohn, author of Nothing but the Blues, writes that rhythm and blues was an umbrella term invented for industry convenience. According to him, the term embraced all black music except classical music and religious music, unless a gospel song sold enough to break into the charts.\n\nLate 1940s\n\nIn 1947, the term rhythm and blues was coined as a musical marketing term in the United States by Jerry Wexler of Billboard magazine. It replaced the term race music, which originally came from within the black community, but was deemed offensive in the postwar world. In that year, Louis Jordan dominated the top five listings of the R&B charts with three songs, and two of the top five songs were based on the boogie-woogie rhythms that had come to prominence during the 1940s.\n\nJordan's band, the Tympany Five (formed in 1938), consisted of him on saxophone and vocals, along with musicians on trumpet, tenor saxophone, piano, bass and drums.Lawrence Cohn described the music as \"grittier than his boogie-era jazz-tinged blues\". Robert Palmer described it as \"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\". Jordan's cool music, along with that of Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Billy Wright, and Wynonie Harris, is now also referred to as jump blues.\n\nIn 1948, RCA Victor was marketing black music under the name Blues and Rhythm. That year found the Wynonie Harris remake of Roy Brown's original 1947 recording \" Good Rockin' Tonight\" in the #2 spot, following band leader Sonny Thompson's \"Long Gone\" at #1.\n\nIn 1949, the term rhythm and blues replaced the Billboard category Harlem Hit Parade. Also in that year, \"The Huckle-Buck\", recorded by band leader and saxophonist Paul Williams, was the #1 R&B tune, remaining on top of the charts for nearly the entire year. Written by musician and arranger Andy Gibson, the song was described as a \"dirty boogie\" because it was risque and raunchy. Paul Williams and His Hucklebuckers' concerts were sweaty riotous affairs that got shut down on more than one occasion. Their lyrics, by Roy Alfred (who later co-wrote the 1955 hit \" (The) Rock and Roll Waltz\"), were mildly sexually suggestive, and one teenager from Philadelphia said \"That Hucklebuck was a very nasty dance.\" Also in 1949, a new version of a 1920s blues song, \" Ain't Nobody's Business\" was a #4 hit for Jimmy Witherspoon, and Louis Jordan and the Tympany Five once again made the top 5 with \" Saturday Night Fish Fry\".\n\nEarly to mid 1950s\n\nWorking with African American musicians, Greek American Johnny Otis, who had signed with the Newark, New Jersey-based Savoy Records, produced many R&B hits in 1951, including: \"Double Crossing Blues\", \"Mistrustin' Blues\" and \"Cupid's Boogie\", all of which hit number one that year. Otis scored ten top ten hits that year. Other hits include: \"Gee Baby\", \"Mambo Boogie\" and \"All Nite Long\". The Clovers, a vocal trio who sang a distinctive sounding combination of blues and gospel, had the #5 hit of the year with \"Don't You Know I Love You\" on Atlantic Records. Also in July 1951, Cleveland, Ohio DJ Alan Freed started a late-night radio show called \"The Moondog Rock Roll House Party\" on WJW-AM (850). Freed's show was sponsored by Fred Mintz, whose R&B record store had a primarily African American clientele. Freed began referring to the rhythm and blues music he played as rock and roll.\n\nRuth Brown, on the Atlantic Records label, placed hits in the top 5 every year from 1951 through 1954: \" Teardrops from My Eyes\", \"Five, Ten, Fifteen Hours\", \"(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean\" and \" What a Dream\". Faye Adams‘s \"Shake a Hand\" made it to #2 in 1952. In 1953, the R&B record-buying public made Willie Mae Thornton's original recording of Leiber and Stoller's Hound Dog the #3 hit that year. That same year The Orioles, a doo-wop group, had the #4 hit of the year with Crying in the Chapel.\n\nIn 1954 The Chords' \" Sh-Boom\" became the first hit to cross over from the R&B chart to hit the top 10 early in the year. Late in the year, and into 1955, \" Hearts of Stone\" by The Charms made the top 20.\n\nMid to late 1950s\n\nFats Domino made the top 30 of the pop charts in 1952 and 1953, then the top 10 with \" Ain't That a Shame\". Ray Charles came to national prominence in 1955 with \" I Got a Woman\". It was an upfront use of gospel music conventions in an R&B context. Big Bill Broonzy said of Charles' music: \"He's mixing the blues with the spirituals... I know that's wrong.\" At the urging of Leonard Chess at Chess Records, Chuck Berry had reworked a fiddle tune with a long history, \" Ida Red\". The resulting \" Maybellene\" was not only a #3 hit on the R&B charts that year, but it also reached into the top 30 on the pop charts. Alan Freed, who had moved to the much larger market of New York City, helped the record become popular with white teenagers. Freed had been given part of the writers' credit by Chess in return for his promotional activities; a common practice at the time. Also at Chess Records in 1955, Bo Diddley's debut record \" Bo Diddley\"/\" I'm A Man\" climbed to #2 on the R&B charts and popularized the Bo Diddley beat.\n\nIn 1956 an R&B \"Top Stars of '56\" tour took place. With headliners Al Hibbler, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and Carl Perkins, whose \" Blue Suede Shoes\" was very popular with R&B music buyers. Some of the performers completing the bill were Chuck Berry, Cathy Carr, Shirley & Lee, Della Reese, the Cleftones, and the Spaniels with Illinois Jacquet's \"Big Rockin' Rhythm Nand. Cities visited by the tour included Columbia, SC, Annapolis, MD, Pittsburgh, PA, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, NY, into Canada, and through the mid Western US ending in Texas. In Columbia the concert ended with a near riot as Perkins began his first song as the closing act. Perkins is quoted as saying, \"It was dangerous. Lot of kids got hurt. There was a lot of rioting going on, just crazy, man! The music drove 'em insane.\" In Annapolis 70,000 to 50,000 people tried to attend a sold out performance with 8,000 seats. Roads were clogged for seven hours.\n\nTwo Elvis Presley records made the R&B top five in 1957: \" Jailhouse Rock\"/\"Treat Me Nice\" at #1, and \" All Shook Up\" at #5, an unprecedented acceptance of a non- African American artist into a music category known for being created by blacks. Nat King Cole, a former jazz pianist who had had #1 and #2 hits on the pop charts in the early 1950s (\" Mona Lisa\" at #2 in 1950 and \" Too Young\" at #1 in 1951), had a record in the top 5 in the R&B charts in 1958, \"Looking Back\"/\"Do I Like It\".\n\nIn 1959, two black-owned record labels, one of which would become hugely successful, made their debut: Sam Cooke's Sar, and Berry Gordy's Motown Records. Brook Benton was at the top of the R&B charts in 1959 and 1960 with one #1 and two #2 hits. Benton had a certain warmth in his voice that attracted a wide variety of listeners, and his ballads led to comparisons with performers such as Cole, Sinatra and Tony Bennett.\n\n1960s- Present\n\nSam Cooke‘s #5 hit \" Chain Gang\" is indicative of R&B in 1960, as is Chubby Checker's #5 hit \" The Twist\". By the early 1960s, the music industry category previously known as rhythm and blues was being called soul music, and similar music by white artists was labeled blue eyed soul.\n\nMotown had its first million-selling single in 1960 with The Miracles' \" Shop Around\". In 1961, Stax Records had its first hit with Carla Thomas' pop-influenced \"Gee Whiz! (Look at His Eyes), which featured violins, piano, drums and backup singers.\" Its next major hit, the Mar-Keys' instrumental \" Last Night\", was released the same year. \"Last Night\" introduced the rawer Memphis soul sound, built around horns, electric organs, guitars, and drums, which became the sound the Stax would be most noted for."
