        "text": "With a deep personal connection to R&B music rooted in my Black queer identity, upbringing in the golden age of R&B (1997- 2011) and PhD which focused on R&B music and Black Queer women R&B artist, I am uniquely positioned to provide insight into the top up-and-coming R&B artists to watch in 2024.\n\nFrom classical piano style records featuring arpeggiated chords and classical-flavoured string arrangements layered on to melismatic gospel-styled vocals to voices heavily altered with autotune a â la 2008, todayâs R&B is characterised by artists that are obsessed with innovation and bringing disparate musical influences together.\n\nThis new age of R&B garners its distinct sound from aggressively pulling away from the conventional boundaries of contemporary and traditional R&B and trading the genreâs defining chord progressions for a synthetic coolness that champions edgier, genre-bending production, whilst maintaining soulful melodies.\n\nSwelling debates regarding whether the genre is alive, or dead seem like a distant fever dream as R&B is taking centre stage not only in the hearts of the genreâs loyalists but also in the hearts of those who once turned their backs on the genre labelling it as âdeadâ. Todayâs R&B is musically ambitious, lyrically complex and alluring, it is calling listeners back to the bedroom and the dark misty clubs found in Hype Williams music videos, in other words, R&B seems to have gotten its groove back.\n\nWhat has made todayâs R&B so addictive is the ways that it speaks to and embodies the shifting and fluid nature of the contemporary consciousness that the genreâs loyalists have begun to adopt. The rawness with which up-and-coming R&B artists muse about life, love and everything in between is a bright, shiny mirror for its audience to truly see themselves and the 14 artists listed below are amongst those holding that mirror up.\n\n2. Natanya\n\nGenres: Jazz R&B, Pop R&B\n\nListen to them if you like: Amy Winehouse and Jean Deaux\n\nLondon-based Natanya is a half Nigerian and half Trinidadian songstress. Like many other artists of her generation, Natanya burst onto the scene via Tiktok with her catchy single âFoolishâ which is infused with early 2000s romantic Latin pop sounds. Natanya didnât take the hype that was building around her lightly as last year she released an impressive self-written six-track debut project entitled Sorrow At Sunrise. Both written by Natanya, the stand-out singles from her debut are âAngelâ and â23â. I saw Natanya perform at Cross The Tracks festival in May 2023 and was very impressed with the way that she was able to make the stage her own. Natanya joins new R&B starlet Destin Conrad as a support act for his summer European tour and Iâm sure she will pick up more fans along the way.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\n3. Cari\n\nGenre: Alternative R&B\n\nListen to them if you like: Brandy, Tracy Chapman and James Fauntleroy\n\nA self-proclaimed music hoarder, Cari is one of those elusive artists who only release music occasionally but when she does it is incredible. If you look in the right places on SoundCloud you may find snippets of Cariâs excellent covers over the years, the best one being her cover of Alex Isleyâs 2012 single âInto Orbitâ.\n\nLast year Cari decided to peel back the cover of elusiveness and release her debut single âColder in Juneâ. Produced by Melo-Zed , âColder in Juneâ is a haunting guitar-led record that not only demonstrates the subtlety of Cariâs pen but also indicates Brandyâs long-lasting influence over this new generation of R&B artists. Cari has followed up on her first single with the release of her second single entitled ' Over & Over'. Cari has mused about wanting to push UK R&B forward with her music, if both of her singles are anything to go by it shows that UK R&B is not only going in the right direction, but it is also in safe hands.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\n5. Rae Khalil\n\nGenre: R&B\n\nListen to them if you like: Anderson .Paak\n\nRecent Def Jam and Apeshit signee Rae Khalil has emerged as a front-runner for the new age artist who can not only sing but also rap pretty well. I first heard Khalil on CARRTOONSâ 2020 album Saturday Morning on the record âFather- Alt. Version and was impressed by her ability to draw listeners in with her smooth vocal and gritty rap verse. Khalil has the rare ability to effortlessly fuse contemporary soul, R&B, and pop elements with timeless hip-hop influences, weaving together euphoric production and compelling storytelling.\n\nHaving already won a Grammy in 2021 for her contribution to .Paakâs âLockdownâ, it is no surprise that she has received shoutouts and co-signs from Hip-Hop heavyweights such as Common and Queen Latifah.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\n6. Kali Claire\n\nGenre: R&B\n\nListen to them if you like: Mahalia and Kehlani\n\nI first came across Kali Claire when she opened for India Shawn at her debut London show in June of 2023. Across a series of praised EPs and singles, her distinctive songwriting navigates seamlessly between R&B, futuristic pop, and soulful, cinematic ballads. Not only is Claire a brilliant singer and songwriter, but she has also honed her craft as a producer and engineer.\n\nLike many other singers and producers of her generation, Claire records a lot of her songs at her home studio and regularly shares how she has made some of her songs with her followers on TikTok to give them special insight into her creative process.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\n7. boistory\n\nGenre: R&B, Alternative R&B, experimental afro-R&B\n\nListen to them if you like: Santi and Tay Iwar\n\nBorn in London to Ghanaian and Nigerian parents, Boistory's talent lies in bridging smoothness with rawness. Combining R&B, Afrobeats, and electronica, he stood out as a potent voice in an Afro-R&B scene that was beginning to influence the global R&B scene. Boistory took great pride in defying the conventions of R&B and being more experimental with his musical expression.\n\nReleased earlier this year, his single âBEBEâ featuring Nigerian AltÃ© artist Odunsi (The Engine) is a brilliant example of Boistoryâs ability to combine R&B and AltÃ© sounds with genuine flair and originality.\n\nUnfortunately Boistory passed away earlier this month but he left a powerful and distinct legacy that will continue to live on.\n\nListen on Spotify\n\n14. Tyler Daley\n\nGenre: R&B, lo-fi R&B, Soul\n\nListen to them if you like: Omar and Jordan Rakei\n\nTyler Daley, also known as one-half of the acclaimed Children of Zeus embarks on his journey as a solo artist with his debut project Son of Zeusâ. Daleyâs solo work is an amalgamation of nostalgic reverence for pirate radio, infused with a diverse array of influences spanning roots reggae, street soul, and R&B, while infusing a contemporary twist through his affinity for hip-hop. Daley's debut serves as a personal narrative, that brings its audience closer to him not only as an artist but also as man. Described as an embodiment of the soulful Zeus sound, Daleyâs music encapsulates a fusion of gritty low-fi soul, hip-hop, and R&B."
