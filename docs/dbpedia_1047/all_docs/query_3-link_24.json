        "text": "By SELENA SEABROOKS\n\nThe Dallas Examiner\n\nRhythm and blues, often called R&B, originated in the 1940s when it replaced “race music” and was used as the general marketing term for all African American music, except gospel music. It was strongly influenced by jazz, jump blues and Black gospel music. R&B also influenced jazz in return. Musicians paid little attention to the distinctions between jazz and rhythm and blues and frequently recorded both genres. At the time, most R&B studio musicians were jazz musicians and many jazz musicians were R&B veterans.\n\nAll that jazz\n\n“Jazz music is the power of now. There is no script. It’s a conversation. The emotion is given to you by musicians as they make split-second decisions to fulfill what they feel the moment requires,” jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis once stated.\n\nJazz music first appeared in the late 19th and early 20th century. It evolved from a mixture of Black and White folk music, with roots in West Africa and Europe. The rhythmic and structural elements of jazz derived primarily from West African traditions taken to the North American continent by slaves. These elements encountered European musical elements, such as conventional instruments like the trumpet, string bass and piano.\n\nThe city of New Orleans played a significant role in the development of jazz. Due to the city’s diverse population, people of African, French, Caribbean, Italian, German, Mexican, American Indian and English descent interacted with one another. Because of this, African American musical traditions were mixed with others, and jazz emerged from a blend of ragtime, marches, blues, gospel and other genres of music.\n\nInitially, jazz was mainly for dancing, but later, it became something people sat and listened to. The first jazz recordings were made in 1917. After this, jazz developed rapidly and spread widely. In the 1920s, the center of jazz moved from New Orleans to Chicago and New York. Jazz became so popular in the 1920s that the time period is often called the “Jazz Age.” This was also during the time of prohibition when the selling of alcohol was illegal. During the Jazz Age, illegal clubs called “speakeasies” opened across the U.S. and featured jazz music and dancing and sold alcohol. During this time, many jazz musicians and bands became famous.\n\nBrilliant Black musicians like Louis Armstrong, Duck Ellington, Charlie Parker and Miles Davis led the evolution of jazz, and different jazz styles developed. Those styles included traditional jazz, swing bebop, cool jazz, jazz-rock and other subgenres. At the same time, jazz began to spread outside of the U.S. to parts of the world.\n\nRhythm and blues\n\nIn the 1940s, R&B music exploded in urban cities like New York, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and Los Angeles – cities that had seen an increase in Black Americans due to the Great Migration.\n\nThe 1950s served as the premier decade for classic rhythm and blues. During this time, R&B brands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and oftentimes, background vocalists. Lyrical themes usually encapsulated African American experiences of pain, quests for freedom and joy, and the triumphs and failures of relationships, economics and aspirations.\n\nThe meaning of R&B underwent several shifts. In the early 1950s, R&B was frequently applied to blues records. In the mid-1950s, R&B contributed to the development of rock and roll, and the term was used to refer to music that developed from and incorporated electric blues, gospel and soul music. In the 1960s and 1970s, several British bands, such as the Rolling Stones and the Who, began to be referred to and promoted as R&B bands. By the end of the 1970s, the term rhythm and blues was used as a blanket term for soul and funk music. R&B musicians experimented with syncopated rhythms and more Afrocentric lyrical content during this decade. Artists like Isaac Hayes and Al Green mixed gospel music, African rhythms, and expanded instrumentations into R&B. This led to the development of funk and disco.\n\nThe 1980s brought a newer form of R&B, known as contemporary R&B, which combined rhythm and blues with elements of pop, soul, funk, disco, hip-hop and electronic music. Although it shared some traits with the original R&B genre, contemporary R&B differed in unique ways. It pushed away from guitars and moved toward a smoother sound geared toward dance clubs and urban radio. R&B artists like Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey made vocal virtuosity an integral part of the genre. During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, music producers like Teddy Riley and Bernard Belle introduced the “new jack swing,” which incorporated hip-hop into R&B, blurring the line between the two genres. Artists like New Edition, Keith Sweat, Boddy Brown and Heavy D had taken over R&B charts.\n\nArtists continued to incorporate hip-hop into R&B in the 1990s, creating the emergence of hip-hop soul, which saw R&B move from the dancefloor to a more downbeat, slow pace. R&B artists like Toni Braxton, TLC, Usher, Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill racked up hits and Grammys by emphasizing melismatic, soulful singing and catchy melodies. The combination of R&B and hip-hop continues to the present day. For example, artists like Bryson Tiller and Drake often produce albums that are equal parts singing and rapping.\n\nNotably, R&B has changed and evolved since its introduction in the 1940s. Throughout time, R&B has regularly topped charts, making it one of the most commercially successful genres of music. Present-day R&B remains one of the most popular genres in American music."
