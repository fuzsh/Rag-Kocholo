        "text": "OVER THE LAST couple of weeks, we’ve been making some playlists on DailyEdge.ie’s Spotify account (which is here, if you’d like to follow it).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first one we made was comprised of Songs You Thought Were So Deep When You Were Younger (think: Hero by Enrique Iglesias, What Would You Do by City High, and basically Pink’s entire early discography), the second was a compilation of some amazing Irish women in music to celebrate International Women’s Day 2019 (which we managed to make 4 hours 20 minutes long, with a tracklisting of 69 songs). Then we had a playlist of bops made my Irish people to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, and a playlist called For Anyone Who Spent Too Much Time at Central Bank in their Teens, which left many people feeling personally attacked.\n\nThe final playlist in this series is called Songs That Will Make You Want To Dig Out Your McKenzie Tracksuit, and it features some of the best garage tunes that have been in the charts (which you probably enjoyed when you spent your teen years buying things off the Euro Saver menu so you could spend hours hanging around in a McDonald’s with your mates sending each other songs on your Nokia Music Xpress phones), as well as some songs that will remind you of your teen disco days. The weather’s lovely, so soak up the nostalgia, crack open a can of a generic supermarket own-brand energy drink (as you inexplicably did quite often as a teenager) and enjoy.\n\nHeartbroken (Edit) – T2\n\nBabycakes – 3 Of A Kind\n\nNu Flow – Big Brovaz\n\nMan Dem (feat. Tinchy Stryder) – Chip\n\nAll I Want (Sunship Radio Edit) – Mis-Teeq\n\n21 Seconds – So Solid Crew\n\nChip Diddy Chip – Chip\n\nFix Up, Look Sharp – Dizzee Rascal\n\nFit but You Know It – The Streets\n\nStand Up Tall – Dizzee Rascal\n\nWearing My Rolex – Wiley\n\nDo You Really Like It? – DJ Pied Piper & The Masters of Ceremonies\n\nBody Groove – Architechs, Nana\n\nGotta Get Thru This (D’N'D Radio Edit) – Daniel Bedingfield\n\nRe-Rewind – Artful Dodger (feat.
