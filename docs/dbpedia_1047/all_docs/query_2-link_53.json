        "meta_description": "Big Brovaz is an R&B and hip hop music group from London, England. In their seven-year career they released two studio albums and eight singles. There were three line-up changes with two of the original members leaving halfway through. In 2006, the only two female members launched their own band Booty Luv, which was taking off following the success of their debut single \"Boogie 2nite\". After their second album failed to chart and with low sales of their last two singles, the band decided to split. In May 2012, the four members from the third line-up reformed and toured Australia with S Club 3.",
