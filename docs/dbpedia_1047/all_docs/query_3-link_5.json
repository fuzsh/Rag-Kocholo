        "text": "All you need to know on R&B music: the history of R&B, evolution, sub-genres and artists that have made contemporary R&B what it is today\n\nR&B (Rhythm and Blues) is a genre invented by black American musicians nearly a century ago. R&B is one of the most commercially and culturally important genres of the past century. It’s gone through many changes over the years, but its roots remain. With roots in Jazz and Blues, R&B is known for its use of rhythm and melody, backed by keys, looped drums, synths and strong bass lines.\n\nR&B has spawned countless sub-genres and produced some of the most influential artists in music. R&B’s heritage and influence can be heard, across music genres, but particularly in today’s Pop music. There is simply no contemporary pop music without R&B and its influence.\n\nSo, let’s dive into the rich history of R&B, it’s evolution over the years and explore the sounds and artists that have made it what it is today.\n\nSee also Is R&B Dead in 2023? – Addressing the question that just won’t quite go away\n\nHistory of R&B\n\n1920s – 1940s: Jazz and Blues\n\nThe origins of R&B can be traced back to the Jazz and Blues of the 1920s and 30s. When African American musicians were performing a mixture of Blues, Jazz, and Gospel music in the clubs and juke joints of the South. Singers like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, sang about the hardships of life and the struggle for civil rights. Their music was raw, emotional, and unapologetically black.\n\nIn the 1940s, a new style of R&B emerged, known as jump blues. This sub-genre was characterized by its up-tempo rhythms and catchy melodies. It was the perfect party music and quickly gained popularity among young African Americans. Artists like Louis Jordan and Big Joe Turner were some of the biggest names in jump blues and laid the foundation for the rock and roll music that would come in the 1950s.\n\nSee our list of modern jazz / contemporary jazz artists keeping alive and reinventing the sound of jazz\n\n1950s and 60s: The Golden Age of R&B\n\nThe contemporary sound of R&B really started to take shape in the 1950s and 60s. Crucially, during this time was the rise of doo-wop, a vocal style that relied heavily on harmonies and falsetto singing. Doo-wop groups like The Drifters and The Platters had a string of hits during this time and helped to popularize the sound of R&B.\n\nSoul music also emerges from its Jazz and Blues predecessors. Soul music was a more sophisticated version of R&B that featured emotional vocals, smooth melodies and lush instrumental arrangements. Artists like Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, and Aretha Franklin became icons of the soul music movement. Undeniably, these singers helped define the sound of the era and of this sub-genre of R&B.\n\nCrucially, the 1960s also saw the rise of Motown. Motown is a historic record label that popularised and became synonymous with R&B and Soul Music. Seamlessly bringing R&B and Soul together, Motown artists like The Supremes, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye dominated the charts. Their music became wildly popular and helped bring black music and R&B into the mainstream. Motown was known for its slick, rich production and catchy hooks, and its influence can still be heard in modern R&B music today. Motown alum, Stevie Wonder went on to become the first black winner of Album of the Year at the Grammys.\n\n1970s and 80s: Funk, Disco and New Jack Swing\n\nIn the 1970s, R&B took a turn towards Funk. Credited as an invention of James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, Funk emphasises rhythm and groove over melody. It’s characterised by heavy bass lines and percussion-led rhythms, rather than melody and chord progression. This combination gives the music a distinctly danceable, infectious feel. Importantly, James Brown’s breakout hit, Cold Sweat ushered in a new era of R&B through Funk. Funk bands like Sly and the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic emerged and were hugely influential with many chart successes. Funk remains highly influential in contemporary music, often sampled in hip-hop music and heavily referenced for successful pop albums from Bruno Mars, Lizzo, Dua Lipa.\n\nThe 1970s also saw the rise of Disco, a genre that blended R&B, funk, and electronic music. Disco was popularized by artists like Donna Summer, Chic and The Bee Gees, and was known for its upbeat, danceable rhythms. Disco was a divisive genre, with many seeing it as shallow and commercial, but it nonetheless had a major impact on R&B music and culture.\n\nIn the 1980s, R&B took yet another turn with the rise of new jack swing, a sub-genre that combined R&B with hip-hop and electronic music. New jack swing was characterized by its use of drum machines, synthesizers, and rap verses. It was popularised by the likes of Janet Jackson, Boys II Men, Bel Biv DeVoe and New Edition.\n\n1990s: Mainstream Contemporary R&B, Hip Hop Soul and Neo-Soul\n\nWith the popularity of New Jack Swing, came a mainstream sound in 90s R&B that heavily leaned into contemporary Hip Hop production. Dominated by the likes of TLC, then Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy label signees, Faith Evans, 112 and Mary J Blige. The term ‘Hip Hop Soul’ was originally used to describe this sound.\n\nIn the late 1990s, R&B saw the emergence of Neo-Soul. In contrast to Hip Hop Soul, Neo-Soul emphasizes live instrumentation and the smooth sophisticated melodies of classical Soul music. However, unlike classical Soul, it has heavy Hip Hop drum patterns and influences in how it delivers live instrumentation. It was first popularised by Lauryn Hill in her seminal album ‘The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill’. As Lauryn Hill has never released a sophomore album, the so-called Soulquarian movement became the torch-bearers for Neo-Soul. Producer Questlove and his close collaborators, J-Dilla, D’Angelo, Erykah Badu, Bilal and others brought back depth and emotion to R&B music.\n\nSub-genres of contemporary R&B / Soul Music\n\nIn recent years, R&B has continued to evolve, with artists incorporating elements of electronic dance music, trap, and other genres. Artists like Sza, Summer Walker and Frank Ocean have dominated the charts with their hits that blend R&B roots, soulful vocals with modern production.\n\n30 Best Contemporary R&B Albums of the past decade (2010 to now) 40 Contemporary R&B Artists to Watch 40 Contemporary R&B Songs - a playlist of R&B hits and chart toppers that prove the genre is timelessly relevant today 100 New R&B Songs - An ever-fresh playlist of selects of the most essential new songs in R&B, Soul & Soulful Rap right now R&B Playlists - Our selection of playlists for different moods and moments across the sub-genres of R&B Is R&B Dead in 2023? - Addressing the question that just won’t quite go away\n\nFrom soulful ballads to upbeat dance tracks, R&B has something for everyone.
