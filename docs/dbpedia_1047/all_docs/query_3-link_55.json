        "text": "For decades, the Billboard Hot 100 and Top 40 charts have been populated with rhythm and blues, an American musical genre first developed by Black artists in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nWhat Is R&B (Rhythm and Blues) Music?\n\nR&B stands for Rhythm and Blues. The term was first used in the 1940s to describe a subgenre of jazz, particularly the jazz sung by African Americans. It later became a catch-all phrase that encompassed many types of popular music that were also rhythmically oriented. R&B has had a number of incarnations over the years, but it is generally characterized by a strong rhythmic foundation and an emphasis on vocal melody over instrumental accompaniment.\n\n[sc name=”general”][/sc]\n\nInstruments Used in Making R&B Music\n\nElectric instruments and amplified instruments are often used in R&B.\n\nDrums, bass, a piano or organ, and the guitar are some of the most common . The horn section consists of the saxophone, trumpet, and the trombone.\n\nRhythm and Blues is a type of music that incorporates many genres. When it first originated, it had a heavy beat and was jazz based. Later in the 1900’s, R&B was used as a term for blues, soul and funk. A form of R&B called Contemporary R&B was formed towards the end of the 1900’s and includes elements of Funk, pop and hip hop.\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between Rhythm and Blues, Soul and Funk?\n\nRhythm and blues is a genre of popular music that originated in African American communities in the 1940s. Rhythm and blues was influenced by blues, jazz, gospel music, and country. By the late 1950s, rhythm and blues had become a major part of popular music. The term “rhythm and blues” was first used in the late 1940s by Billboard magazine.\n\nSoul music is a genre of popular music originating in the United States. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement. Soul also became popular around the world as well; it was popular with British bands such as The Beatles for example.\n\nFunk is a style of music characterized by a strong rhythm section that usually consists of electric bass and drums playing repeated lines throughout a song with each line varying slightly from the last. Funk uses a strong bass line along with powerful drumming to create an upbeat sound that often is associated with dancing\n\n3 Characteristics of Classic R&B\n\nClassic R&B of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s is united by several key elements.\n\n1. Strong overlap with rock music\n\nMany of the best R&B acts of this early era were co-categorized as rock ‘n’ roll. These predominantly Black artists in turn inspired many white rock bands, including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\n2. Guitar-based instrumentation\n\nMany of the best R&B acts of this early era were co-categorized as rock ‘n’ roll. These predominantly Black artists in turn inspired many white rock bands, including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.\n\n3. Inspiration from blues and church music\n\nMany early R&B artists were steeped in blues and gospel traditions. Some R&B albums from this era contain openly Christian themes, while others reworked blues standards for contemporary audiences."
