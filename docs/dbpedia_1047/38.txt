Disco Era

The Disco Era marked the dawn of the modern era of dance-based popular music. Growing out of the increasingly groove-oriented sound of early ’70s and funk, disco emphasized the beat above anything else, even the singer and the song. Disco was named after discotheques, clubs that played nothing but music for dancing.

Disco music was introduced to the nightlife scene as a way to escape the rising social and economic issues of the era, such as war, political scandal, gang violence, unemployment, and soaring crime rates. The increasing race riots and homophobia of the 1960s led to unsafe spaces for people of color and members of the gay community. Disco offered a place where people could come together and dance regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Motown, a record label that played a significant role in the development of R&B and soul music, also played a part in the Disco Era. Whitney Houston, a prominent R&B singer, started her career singing backup vocals for disco and soul music artists. Producers such as Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic were also instrumental in the development of the disco sound.

Some notable disco hits include “Real Love” by Mary J. Blige, “Try Again” by Aaliyah, and “How Could You” by Mario. Macy Gray’s debut album, “On How Life Is,” incorporated elements of funk, soul, and disco, and helped to revive interest in the genre in the late 1990s.
