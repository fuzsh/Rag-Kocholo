The location is displayed in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) notation and is stored in decimal degrees with altitude and accuracy. Learn more about the format of resulting data in the location widgets section.\n\nThis question type shows a dialog with the current accuracy and lets the data collector decide when to capture the point. For capturing location without data collector intervention, see start-geopoint. For a geopoint with a user-selected location, see placement-map.\n\nXLSForm with optional parameters\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nhint\n\nparameters\n\ngeopoint\n\ngeopoint_widget\n\nGeopoint widget\n\ngeopoint type\n\ncapture-accuracy=10 warning-accuracy=10 allow-mock-accuracy=true\n\nThere are three parameters that can be used to customize a geopoint question's behavior:\n\ncapture-accuracy: when the device accuracy reaches this value or better, the point will be automatically captured and the dialog will close. If you always want data collectors to make an explicit decision about accepting a point, set this value to 0. Defaults to 5 (meters), a target that can usually be reached by modern devices given enough time. We generally do not recommend setting this value to below 3 (meters) unless you are using an external GPS device. You can also set an accuracy constraint.\n\nwarning-accuracy: when the device accuracy is this value or worse, the dialog is red and displays a message stating that the accuracy is unacceptable. There is no enforcement of the threshold so if a data collector needs to capture a point with an unacceptable accuracy (e.g. because they can't wait any longer), they can do so. Set this value to the same value as capture-accuracy if you generally always want your data collectors to wait until the point is automatically captured. Defaults to 100 (meters), about the length of a city block. In extreme conditions such as under dense forest canopy, any reported accuracy may be considered acceptable. In that case, you can set this value to a very large number.\n\nallow-mock-accuracy: set to true to use an external GPS device that uses the mock GPS provider. Otherwise, any location captured from a mock provider will have an accuracy of 0.\n\nA dialog is used to give data collectors feedback on the location they are capturing:\n\nThe dialog is designed to guide the data collector to capture a point with the best reported accuracy possible. The current accuracy is shown at the top of the dialog (1). A message below it (2) gives a qualitative assessment of the accuracy (e.g. unacceptable, poor) and suggested action (e.g. wait). The progress bar (3) gives a visual representation of progress towards an acceptable accuracy.\n\nThe bottom half of the dialog displays troubleshooting information. The first line (4) shows the accuracy at which the point will be automatically captured. This is configured by the capture-accuracy parameter. You can ask data collectors to watch time elapsed (5) and let you know if it is systematically taking them a long time to get high-accuracy points. This may indicate an issue with their device.\n\nYou can also train data collectors to use time elapsed to take some action. For example, you can let them know to capture any point available after waiting for 2 minutes. Number of satellites (6) can be useful when capturing points outdoors. A low number of satellites (under 4) may indicate that something is wrong with the device or its position. See Improving Location Performance.\n\nTip\n\nYou can use selected-at() to require geopoints meet a particular threshold. For example, if you need points with an accuracy better than 10 meters, use this constraint:\n\nselected-at(${geopoint_widget}, 3) < 10.\n\nThe 3 in the above constraint references accuracy, the fourth space-separated value in the geopoint data type. The selected-at function uses 0-based indexing so you can use 0 to reference latitude, 1 for longitude, and 2 for altitude.\n\nGeopoint with map display¶\n\ntype\n\ngeopoint\n\nappearance\n\nmaps\n\nThe default Geopoint widget does not display a map to the user. When the appearance attribute is maps, the widget displays a map to help the user get oriented and confirm that the selected point is correct and sufficiently accurate.\n\nWhen the device's geolocation is available, it is displayed on the map by a blue cross. A blue shaded circle around the cross represents the accuracy radius of the geolocation. The \"add marker\" button at the top right of the screen can be tapped to add a point at the location indicated by the middle of the blue cross. The selected point is represented by a small circle with a red outline.\n\nWhen the map view is opened again with a selected point, the map is centered on that point. To change the selection, first tap the \"trash\" icon and then select a new point.\n\nFor a geopoint with a location that the user can manually select or adjust, see Geopoint with user-selected location.\n\nXLSForm\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nappearance\n\nhint\n\ngeopoint\n\ngeopoint_widget_maps\n\nGeopoint widget\n\nmaps\n\ngeopoint type with maps appearance\n\nGeopoint with user-selected location¶\n\ntype\n\ngeopoint\n\nappearance\n\nplacement-map\n\nThe default Geopoint widget does not allow the user to place the point anywhere other than the device's current geolocation.\n\nA geopoint with the appearance attribute placement-map allows the user to select any point from a map. The user can either long press to place the point anywhere, or, if the device knows its geolocation, tap on the \"add point\" button at the top right of the screen. The selected point is represented by a small circle with a red outline (see arrow in screenshot).\n\nThe save button saves the selected point and returns to the question screen. If the point was selected by long pressing, the accuracy radius and altitude will both be 0. If the device's geolocation was selected, the accuracy radius will be greater than 0.\n\nWhen the map view is opened again with an existing point, the map is centered on the selected point. To change the selection, first tap the \"trash\" icon and then select a new point.\n\nXLSForm\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nappearance\n\nhint\n\ngeopoint\n\ngeopoint_widget_placementmap\n\nGeopoint widget\n\nplacement-map\n\ngeopoint type with placement-map appearance\n\nGeotrace widget¶\n\ntype\n\ngeotrace\n\nappearance\n\nnone\n\nA series of points. Identical to geoshape except that the first and last point may be different and at least 2 points are required.\n\nPoints can be entered either by tapping the screen to place each point, or by taking readings of the device's geolocation over time. On a map, each coordinate is represented by small circles with red outlines. These are connected by red lines.\n\nTo collect a geotrace, first select the location-recording mode by tapping the \"add point\" button in the upper right side of the screen. The selected mode will be displayed in the gray bar at the bottom of the screen. While point collection is ongoing, the \"add marker\" button changes to a \"pause\" button. The \"back arrow\" button can be used to remove the last-entered point either when actively collecting points or when paused. Any point can be manually moved at any time by tapping on it and dragging it. The mode can only be changed if an existing line is first cleared by tapping the \"trash\" button. Recording must be paused to clear the existing line.\n\nTip\n\nPoints that were entered by tapping or adjusted by dragging will always have an accuracy radius of 0. Points that were read from the device location will never have an accuracy radius of 0.\n\nOnce the trace has been saved, the coordinates of its points will be displayed on the question screen. The trace can be opened for manual editing by tapping to add more points, moving existing points or deleting the last-added point. After a trace has been saved once, it cannot be added to in manual or automatic location recording modes.\n\nThe three location recording modes are:\n\nPlacement by tapping\n\nThe user taps the device to place points.\n\nManual location recording\n\nThe user chooses when to tap the \"record a point\" button at the top of the screen to capture the device geolocation at that moment.\n\nAutomatic location recording\n\nThe user is prompted to select a recording interval and accuracy requirement. If the accuracy requirement is set to None, points are always collected at the recording interval. If the accuracy requirement is set to any other value, a point will only be captured if it meets the requirement. For example, given a recording interval of 20 seconds and an accuracy requirement of 10 meters, the app places a point at the device location every 20 seconds if the location is accurate to 10 meters or better.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you are using Aggregate and you would like to collect more than 5 points at a time, you should increase the database field length to over 255 characters. Otherwise, additional points will be lost.\n\nXLSForm\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nGeoshape¶\n\ntype\n\ngeoshape\n\nappearance\n\nnone\n\nA series of points that form a closed polygon. Identical to geotrace except that the first and last point are always the same and at least 3 points are required.\n\nPoints can be entered either by tapping the screen to place each point, or by taking readings of the device's geolocation over time. On a map, each coordinate is represented by small circles with red outlines. These are connected by red lines.\n\nTo collect a geoshape, first select the location-recording mode by tapping the \"add point\" button in the upper right side of the screen.

Points that were read from the device location will never have an accuracy radius of 0.\n\nOnce the shape has been saved, the coordinates of its points will be displayed on the question screen. The shape can be opened for manual editing by tapping to add more points, moving existing points or deleting the last-added point. After a shape has been saved once, it cannot be added to in manual or automatic location recording modes.\n\nThe three location recording modes are:\n\nPlacement by tapping\n\nThe user taps the device to place points.\n\nManual location recording\n\nThe user chooses when to tap the \"record a point\" button at the top of the screen to capture the device geolocation at that moment.\n\nAutomatic location recording\n\nThe user is prompted to select a recording interval and accuracy requirement.

At the top left of this bar is an icon to represent whether recording is currently ongoing or paused (1). To the right of this icon is the current length of the recording (2).\n\nWarning\n\nPause is only available on Android 7.0 and above. On lower Android versions, the pause button is hidden.\n\nAt the right of the control bar are a pause button (3) and a stop button (4). When the pause button is tapped, recording is temporarily suspended and the button icon changes to a microphone. When the microphone is tapped, recording is resumed. Recording can be paused and resumed as many times as desired. When the stop button is tapped, the recording is ended and can no longer be modified.\n\nRecording status is also displayed below the audio question text. There is a time representing the current length of the recording (5) and a diagram (6) representing the volume of the recording over time. The diagram provides confirmation that the microphone is working and can help a user ensure an even, sufficient volume.\n\nOther questions can be included on the same screen as a built-in recording question. As shown in the screenshot above, this makes it possible to capture quantitative content while recording. To achieve this, put the questions in a field list.\n\nDuring recording, the user is prevented from leaving the current question screen. However, it is safe to use other applications or to lock the device screen.\n\nOnce recording is stopped, the control bar disappears. The recording is made available for playback below the question text.\n\nTo replace the audio captured, first delete the current file and then record again.\n\nIn some rare cases such as the device running out of space, the recording may complete successfully but not be attached to the form. If this happens, a dialog will be displayed explaining that the file is available but needs to be accessed manually. You can find these files in the recordings folder of the Collect directory.

If a quality is specified, the built-in recorder is always used, regardless of Collect settings. If no quality is specified and external app recording has been disabled, normal is used. The available quality values are:\n\nValue\n\nExtension\n\nEncoding\n\nBit rate\n\nSample rate\n\nFile size\n\nnormal\n\n.m4a\n\nAAC\n\n64 kbps\n\n32 kHz\n\n~30 MB/hour\n\nlow\n\n.m4a\n\nAAC\n\n24 kbps\n\n32 kHz\n\n~11 MB/hour\n\nvoice-only\n\n.amr\n\nAMR\n\n12.2 kbps\n\n8 kHz\n\n~5 MB/hour\n\nTip\n\nWe'd recommend only using voice-only for one-on-one interviews in a quiet place as otherwise there might be too much detail loss. low will sound compressed but speech is generally intelligible, even if multiple people are talking at once. normal is similar to typical podcast settings and will sound good on most devices.\n\nIt's a good idea to test the different qualities out with the device (and any other equipment) you'll be using in the field to see which one fits your use case and setup best.\n\nXLSForm\n\nIn the parameters column, write quality= followed by the desired value.\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nparameters\n\naudio\n\nvoice_only_audio\n\nVoice audio\n\nquality=voice-only\n\naudio\n\nnormal_audio\n\nNormal audio\n\nquality=normal\n\nChanging audio quality during form entry¶\n\nIf it's a possibility that an individual question could need different qualities depending on context you can use relevance to switch between them:\n\nXLSForm\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nparameters\n\nrelevance\n\n¶\n\nlist_name\n\nname\n\nlabel\n\nyes_no\n\nyes\n\nYes\n\nyes_no\n\nno\n\nNo\n\nGeolocation at survey start¶\n\nSee also\n\nAudit log geolocation tracking\n\nNote\n\nGeolocation at survey start was added in Collect v1.23 and Central v1.0.0.\n\nThe start-geopoint question type is used to capture a single geolocation in geopoint format when the survey is first started. Questions of type start-geopoint may be given any allowable name. Although it is possible to have more than one start-geopoint question in a form, all will have the same value.\n\nAny time a survey with a start-geopoint question is opened in Collect, the enumerator will see a warning that the form tracks device location. If the device battery is low, or if location tracking needs to be turned off for any reason, you can tap ⋮ ‣ Track location or turn off location providers in Android.\n\nThe first time that a survey with a start-geopoint question is opened, Collect will attempt to read the device's geolocation. The geolocation reading with the highest accuracy received in a 20-second window will be recorded. A location icon will be displayed in the Android status bar while the geolocation is being requested by Collect.\n\nGeolocation is read using data from GPS, WiFi and possibly other signals so this feature should work in most environments.\n\nIf geolocation information is unavailable, the question will be left blank. Reasons for a blank value may include the enumerator turning off location providers, Collect not having location permissions, Google Play Services not being installed, the GPS not having satellite lock and more. No troubleshooting information is provided in the form submission.\n\nIncluding a start-geopoint question may make it faster to get high-accuracy geolocation readings for other location question types by \"warming\" the GPS.\n\nBackground audio recording¶\n\ntype\n\nbackground-audio\n\nAdded in version 1.30: ODK Collect v1.30.0, Central v1.2.0\n\nXLSForm\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nbackground-audio\n\nmy_recording\n\nWhen a form includes a question of type background-audio, audio is recorded while the form is open and attached to the form submission as a single audio file. These recordings can be used for quality assurance, training, transcription, and more. Use background recording instead of an audio question when you want to make sure to record everything that happens during form filling.\n\nBy default, audio files will be saved in the amr format with a bitrate of 12.2 kbps and a sample rate of 8 kHz, resulting in a file size of about 5 MB per hour. These settings correspond to the voice-only quality for audio questions and minimize file size while maintaining reasonable quality for a conversation between two people. You can override that default quality by specifying a value in the parameters column as described for audio questions.\n\nXLSForm\n\n¶\n\ntype\n\nname\n\nparameters\n\nbackground-audio\n\nmy_recording\n\nquality=low\n\nPlanning for background audio recording¶\n\nBefore adding background audio recording to your form, make sure that you have a plan for following local laws around audio recording. We generally recommend including a note at the beginning of the form to remind data collectors and participants that they are being recorded and to describe the purpose of the recording. Depending on the context, you may be required to ask for the consent of every person in speaking range of the microphone.\n\nAdditionally, you should make a plan for using the resulting audio files. Do you have someone who can listen to and make sense of many audio files? Could you get access to speech-to-text capabilities? Also consider whether your data collectors will be able to send audio files. Will they have access to a fast enough Internet connection? Will their Internet plan or number of credits allow them to send all the audio files you expect?\n\nIt can be helpful to combine background audio recording with audit logging to have more context while listening to the recording. Recording starts at the form start and form resume events and stops at the form exit event. You can use the difference between the form start time and the start time of an event to identify how far into the background recording a certain event happened.\n\nBackground audio recording user interface¶\n\nWhile recording is ongoing, an audio status bar is shown at the top of the screen. This bar helps remind data collectors that they are being recorded and provides visual feedback about audio volume.\n\nIf a data collector exits a form and then re-opens it for editing, audio recording is resumed. Audio recording continues as long as the form is open, even if another application is in the foreground or the screen is locked. Note that Collect settings can't be accessed directly from a form that has background recording. The audio file sent to the server will include audio from every time that the form was opened for editing.\n\nTip\n\nAndroid devices can make many sounds during use and these will be included in recordings. We recommend turning off sounds from button presses, camera shutters and notifications before recording.\n\nThere is an override available to data collectors when recording might compromise safety or when consent to record can't be obtained but it's still important to capture some data. When the audio recording option is unchecked, audio recording ends immediately and any previously-recorded audio is deleted. Recording can't be resumed during the current form-filling session. Toggling the audio recording option back on indicates that the next form filling session should be recorded. If audit logging is enabled, a background audio disabled event will be logged if a data collector toggles off recording and a background audio enabled event will be logged if a data collector toggles it back on.\n\nBackground audio recording troubleshooting¶\n\nIn some rare cases such as the device running out of space, the recording may complete successfully but not be attached to the form. If this happens, the recording may be available in the recordings folder of the Collect directory. This folder is never cleared so consider emptying it yourself once you have retrieved its files."
