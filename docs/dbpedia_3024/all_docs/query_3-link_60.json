When you say you’re gonna do something you do it and stick to it and that really means a lot as a dealer and a farmer, so we’re really pleased to work with you guys.\n\nClick the link to hear more about what Will has to say on this episode of Cup of Joe: https://youtu.be/-LtudpBK-V4\n\n“Yields on beans were very strong as we raised some of the best beans we ever have. I have to give a lot of credit to our nemesis, Mother Nature, on the rains that we had all year, but the strong genetics and treatment package from Merschman Seeds was a big component to our success, as well. Our plot was really strong posting some big numbers that was shocking to us. Even the double crops that we planted later than normal were excellent, which surprised us considering what they went through. All in all it was a great year for soybeans.” Excerpt via Agrinews\n\nI was really excited to see all of the new varieties (Merschman Seeds) has out. I think you're going to have a great line up this year. I think if it's a new product it has probably proven itself to Joe, and if he thinks it will work, I trust him, because in the years past, we've had great luck with Merschman beans, and I don't think this year will be any different."
