You will be charged the current admission fee which will be fully refunded when you return within ½ hour, your allotted time to shop.\n\nSeeds\n\nIn 1920 The Gardens started the Benvenuto Seed Company when it began collecting and selling seeds through its annual seed catalogue. Although seeds are no longer collected by our gardeners, all of the seeds sold from our Seed & Gift Store are meticulously hand packaged by our Gift Store staff. The delicate Tibetan Blue Poppy is the only remaining seed type still harvested and supplied by our gardeners, and hand packaged by our staff."
