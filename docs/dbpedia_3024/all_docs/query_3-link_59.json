I'm really looking forward to growing Pawpaws, and love that I can rest assured that they will replace or reimburse my order if they die within this first year. It's a very nice thing to know that I'm not just throwing my money at a company and hoping for the best. With Gurney's, I KNOW that things will go well, because their customer service is excellent. - Dec 01 Source\n\nCan't beat the candy onions from Gurney's seed. They are easy to grow and very sweet mild onions. They also store extremely well. I rarely have to buy onions since my candy onion last from harvest until April and my newly planted ones are often ready for pulling in June. - Dec 05 Source\n\nI have purchased from Gurney's in the past when I had a large garden. After several years without garden space, I am again ready to get dirt under my fingernails. I always had good results with Gurney's seeds in the past, so here I am again! - Dec 02, Source\n\nI know it's not local, but their fruit trees and vines cannot be beat, and I save so much time shopping around. It's done and now I can go on about my business of gardening while I await spring when my order arrives. - Dec 02 Source\n\nGurney's is a great place to get seeds, they have everything that you would need to have a awesome garden. They have almost every seed that you would want everything to veggies, fruits and trees! I would highly recommend ordering from Gurney's seed & nursery co. - Nov 18 Source"
