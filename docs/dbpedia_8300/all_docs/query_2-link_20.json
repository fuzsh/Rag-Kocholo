        "text": "Ruby Philosophy\n\nMatz (Yukihiro Matsumoto), Ruby creator, says:\n\n\"I believe people want to express themselves when they program. They don't want to fight with the language.\"\n\n\"Programming languages must feel natural to programmers.\"\n\n\"I tried to make people enjoy programming and concentrate on the fun and creative part of programming when they use Ruby.\"\n\n\"For me the purpose of life is partly to have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, So Ruby is designed to make programmers happy.\"\n\n\"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python.\""
