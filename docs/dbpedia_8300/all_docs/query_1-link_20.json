        "text": "CoffeeScript Family (& Friends)\n\nCoffeeScript Unfancy JavaScript\n\nCoffeeScript II: The Wrath of Khan Rewrite of the CS compiler\n\nFamily (share genes with CoffeeScript)\n\nCoco A CoffeeScript dialect that aims to be more radical and practical, also acts as a test bed for features that get imported in CoffeeScript.\n\nLiveScript is a fork of Coco that is much more compatible with CoffeeScript, more functional, and with more features.\n\nIcedCoffeeScript A CoffeeScript dialect that adds support for await and defer keywords which simplify async control flow.\n\nParsec CoffeeScript CS based on parser combinators. The project's aim is to add static metaprogramming (i.e. macros + syntax extensibility) to Coffee Script (CS), similar to how Metalua adds such features to Lua. The resulting compiler, once merged with the official compiler, should be usable as a drop-in replacement for it.\n\nContracts.coffee A dialect of CoffeeScript that adds built-in support for contracts.\n\nUberscript, a CoffeeScript fork that adds type annotations which are compiled to Google closure compiler type annotation comments.\n\nToffeeScript A dialect of CoffeeScript that support Asynchronous Syntax and Regexp operator =~\n\nCaffeine A dialect of CoffeeScript that support packages and classes import, useful for browser applications\n\nheap.coffee A dialect of CoffeeScript that offers a C-like type system with manual memory management\n\nEmberScript Ember.js-infused CoffeeScript.\n\nFriends (philosophically related)\n\nKaffeine Enhanced Syntax for JavaScript.\n\nJack Making programming playful.\n\nmove A simpler and cleaner programming language.\n\nMoescript Indent-based language\n\npogoscript language that emphasises readability, handles async control flow nicely, is friendly to domain specific languages and compiles to regular JavaScript\n\nLispyScript A JavaScript with Lispy syntax and Macros.\n\nWisp Wisp is a homoiconic JavaScript dialect with clojure syntax, s-expressions and macros.\n\nHot Cocoa Lisp A Lisp-like language that compiles to JavaScript.\n\nSibilant JavaScript with a lisp.\n\nHam looks very similar to Javascript at first, but offers (hopefully) many useful features\n\nGorillaScript Compile-to-JavaScript language designed to empower the user while attempting to prevent some common errors, offers Macros and optional Typing\n\nRedScript Ruby flavored JavaScript.\n\nDaonode functional logic solver, compiler.\n\nJavaScript Extensions\n\nSecurity enforcing JavaScript\n\nCaja Compiles ES5/strict to ES3 and supports object-capabilities\n\nADsafe Client-side static verifier and API, making third party scripts safe.\n\nFBJS Facebook JavaScript, used for scripting FBML (Facebook Markup Language) gadgets.\n\nJacaranda Static verifier supporting object-capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft Web Sandbox Technology preview of securing web content through isolation.\n\nGatekeeper Microsoft Research project.\n\nDojo Secure Framework for building secure mashups.\n\nLocal.js uses Web Workers to sandbox applications and a RESTful messaging protocol called HTTPL (HTTP Local) to communicate between them\n\nStatic typing\n\nSome of the ones listed below are also statically typed, such as mobl, GWT, JSIL, NS Basic, and Haxe.\n\nDart by Google.
