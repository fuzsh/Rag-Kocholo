        "text": "Abstract Ruby is a popular, dynamic scripting language that aims to\" feel natural to programmers\" and give users the\" freedom to choose\" among many different ways of doing the same thing. While this arguably makes programming in Ruby easier, it makes it hard to build analysis and transformation tools that operate on Ruby source code. In this paper, we present the Ruby Intermediate Language (RIL), a Ruby front-end and intermediate representation that addresses these.\n\nThe two most dominant rising programming dialects in reality, Ruby and Python have many features in common. High-level object-oriented coding, interactive shell, standard libraries, persistence support are some of the common features of Python and Ruby. However, both vary in their approach to solve problems because of their syntax and uses. Power of a language is based on the libraries and popularity defines the frameworks that have been used. This research paper primarily focuses on the frameworks and libraries of Ruby and Python. Ruby on Rails is one of the most powerful framework of Ruby and Django for python. Python is used for many purposes beyond web development such as data science and machine learning computations. A spike in popularity is seen for both Ruby and Python but still the question of “which to be opted” for developing an application becomes a query most of the times. Hence, this research scrutinizes both Ruby and Python in terms of framework and libraries.\n\nBeginners of programming sometimes faced to such situation that they themselves considered to be very poor programmer due to receipt of several types of errors from compilers, interpreters and language processors. But we have to learn and teach programming in some computer languages from lower education to higher one. It is necessary for us to utilize suitable tools for effective learning of current computer language programming. We have designed and implemented a Web application to support program learning of Python and Ruby. With this tool, it will be more fruitful for learners to recognize numbers of errors, error types, and history to change numbers and types of errors in order to gain individual understanding level of programming in Python and Ruby.\n\nThese notes are the by-product of a never-held seminar on the Ruby language. I like the Ruby language: it has a lot of peculiar features, interesting ideas implemented and a lot of features built into the language; it is a complex language, so, while studying the language, I prepared some raw notes for myself, with the idea of a Ruby seminar for my colleagues, but a Python course was more than enough for them, so the seminar was never held.\n\nThis research was performed in order to find out whether a new programming tool (Scratch) could be used to teach programming to novices more effectively. According to Black (2006:109) the problem of teaching programming to novices stands in effectively communicating programming information to students. Therefore, this research argues that certain characteristics of the Scratch program and the Scratch programming environment make it a perfect teaching tool for first year programming students.\n\nTeaching &quot;Principles of Programming Languages&quot; at an undergraduate level in a small liberal arts college is very challenging. Most of the concepts such as grammars, syntax, semantics, are very difficult for students that know only one or two programming languages. This paper discusses a &quot;learning-by-doing&quot; approach used in the author&#39;s &quot;Programming Languages&quot; course since 2002. We present a term project for design and implementation of an interpreter for a simple programming language.\n\nThis is a monograph that discussed on the subject of which programming language better suits an educator's needs to provide an introductory level understanding of computer programming to their students. It develops the case to various programming paradigms and finally draw a conclusion on which language best suits the given action. Finally it leaves the question open to let the reader make her own decision over this matter."
