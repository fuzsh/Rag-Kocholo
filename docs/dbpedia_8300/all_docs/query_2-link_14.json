        "text": "Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in Japan.\n\nRuby embodies syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features and was also influenced by Eiffel and Lisp.[1] It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Therefore, it is similar in varying degrees to, Smalltalk, Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU."
