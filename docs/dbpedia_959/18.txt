On her third studio album, Meredith Andrews continues the sweetly uplifting sound she crafted on Invitation and the Dove Award-winning As Long as It Takes.

Songs such as "Not for a Moment (After All)" define Worth It All and her style in general, reflecting a subtlety and immediacy that make Andrews' approach to praise & worship unique.

This shouldn't be a surprise, given that she's been a songwriter since her high-school days, but nevertheless, it's refreshing.
