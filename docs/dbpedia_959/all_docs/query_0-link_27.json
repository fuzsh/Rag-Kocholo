        "text": "“Look at all the lonely people.”\n\nNearly 60 years ago, The Beatles sang those words as part of their song, “Eleanor Rigby.” While generations have come and gone, the reality remains the same - loneliness is a serious problem for far too many people.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Surgeon General listed loneliness as the greatest threat to Americans’ health. In 2018, the United Kingdom created a Minister of Loneliness as they identified over 200,000 Brits who hadn’t interacted with a friend or relative in over one month. A recent study indicated that 52% of Americans are lonely on a regular basis and 57% eat all of their meals alone.\n\nI’ve lived those data points. Back in 2014, our family had a major crisis and I realized I was drowning in a sea of casual, superficial friendships with other men. While I had guys I’d text and occasionally watch a game with, none of them really knew what was going on in my world and I wasn’t sharing just how much I was struggling with any of them.\n\nIn the years that followed, I worked hard to be more intentional and vulnerable with a handful of men I trusted. Some of those relationships deepened and a few of those men were real anchors during a very challenging season of life. These men encouraged me and I watched God’s promises to be present with me be fulfilled through them.\n\nYet, our family didn’t just survive that season because of the friends we found standing beside us in the storm. We made it through because of the very real and tender care God showed us. We experienced God shepherding our souls and moving in our lives miraculously. It was as if Psalm 23 was happening day-by-day for us.\n\nPsalm 23 is perhaps the most beloved psalm of all time. It is the subject of countless devotions, books, sermons, and songs. One version in particular released in 2018 featuring Josh Sherman. The video of this call-and-response song from People & Songs went viral, racking up 41 million views on YouTube.\n\nPhil King and Meredith Andrews recently released a new version of the song, \"Psalm 23.\" In a post on his website, People & Songs, King shared the motive behind this new release. “We wanted an arrangement of this song that further breaks down the barriers between us and God. So we removed the call and response in hopes of making it even more accessible and usable for worshippers. We wanted each heart to be able sing out in whatever state or place they find themselves; in spite of feelings of isolation, and without a worship leader. The truth is, God promises to never leave us or forsake us.”\n\nListen to Psalm 23 (I Am Not Alone) by Phil King & Meredith Andrews\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Phil King & Meredith Andrews Combat Isolation in \"Psalm 23 (I Am Not Alone)\"\n\nThe lyrics of Psalm 23 invite us to stand on the promises of God and apply them to whatever crisis we are facing today.\n\n“He always guides me\n\nThrough mountains and valleys\n\nHis joy is refreshing\n\nHe restores my soul”\n\nThese lyrics and others translate the six short verses of Psalm 23 into words of comfort and encouragement. There is a very real sense as you listen to the song that you’re asking and allowing God to shepherd your soul in the middle of a hard time.\n\nHowever, the strength of this song (and the psalm from which it draws its name) is that it’s not merely about the challenges of our present. After all, Psalm 23 ends with David’s eyes turned towards the future with hope because of how God has moved in the present.\n\n“Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me\n\nall the days of my life\n\nand I will live in the house of the Lord\n\nForever.”\n\nDavid’s experience with God in the past has set his expectation for life in the future. In Psalm 23, Phil King and Meredith Andrews invite us to declare the same kind of faith-filled expectation.\n\n“Your Spirit lives within me\n\nSo I will walk in Your peace\n\nYour Spirit lives within me\n\nMy victory, my victory”\n\nI confess that it was hardest for me to sing these lyrics. After a battle with anxiety and panic on-and-off for the last seven years, it’s not easy for me to believe that I will walk in peace. I’m navigating some battles today that I’ve wavered within; will I ever see victory here?\n\nRight on the heels of those lyrics and those questions, a line comes in the bridge which allows me to take a deep breath and know that it’s okay. It’s okay that I feel this way and when it comes to what I’m facing, it’s going to be okay. What’s the lyric that shepherded me through those intense feelings and questions?\n\n“Hallelujah, I am not alone (I am not alone, I am not alone)”\n\nLoneliness is so dangerous because we’re more vulnerable to spiritual attack and discouragement when we don’t have a Good Shepherd or good friends on which to lean. But, when we realize we are not alone, our soul sings Hallelujah! Psalm 23:4 is the reminder we need, “Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me.”\n\nSo, even if you’re in a season where your friendships are too few and superficial to feel like they matter, God has not abandoned you. You are not alone. I encourage you to visit Air1.com and play \"Psalm 23\" by Phil King and Meredith Andrews. Put it on repeat for a few minutes if necessary. Read and re-read the six verses of David’s psalm. Meditate on these old and comforting true words.\n\nThough you may feel lonely, you are not alone. You are going to be okay."
