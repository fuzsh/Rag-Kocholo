        "text": "In 1988, David Village graduated from Andrews University with a master’s in physical therapy. Prior to attending Andrews, he was a literature evangelist from 1977 to 1984. After he received his MSPT he worked at the Kettering Medical Center for seven years before returning to Andrews in 1995 to begin teaching for the Department of Physical Therapy.\n\nFor Dave, teaching at a university was not what he had initially imagined as his career. However, 25 years later he has taught numerous courses in kinesiology, general medicine and geriatrics—his area of expertise. He has also served as assistant dean of the College of Health & Human Services.\n\n“Working at Andrews has changed me in many ways,” he says. “Being a professor provided many opportunities to serve the local community through service learning and consultation as well as physical therapy colleagues through research.”\n\nDuring his years at Andrews, Dave found it very satisfying to be part of a team that provides training for students. While he never considered himself an administrator, he also enjoyed assisting the dean of the College of Health & Human Services, Emmanuel Rudatsikira.\n\n“Andrews students are extraordinary,” he says. “Faculty often have the opportunity to counsel and pray with students, but the roles were reversed when my wife became ill and eventually died. Students came by my office to check in on me, let me know they cared, and prayed with me.”\n\nSupport and prayers were not the only things Dave is grateful for. He’s also appreciative of the mentorship he received from Bill Habenicht, Wayne Perry, Kim Ferreira and Rudatsikira.\n\nThroughout his career, Dave has seen each day as a gift from God to try and make the lives of others a little better. “The first two verses I read from the Bible as a young man before conversion are still among my favorites: Romans 8:31 and Phillippians 4:13,” he explains. “The experience that has guided my life and career is the ongoing realization of the passion God has to lead me to His salvation and His power to help me share with others.”\n\nNow that he is retired, Dave plans to stay in the area and contract teach undergraduate courses for the exercise science degree, travel, spend time with family and friends, continue working on his hobbies—gardening and backcountry canoeing in Canada—and help with missions. He is also assisting Terry Dodge Jr. in completing a Sam Campbell documentary film. Dave is engaged to Teri Anzures and says, “I am looking forward to this new journey full of possibilities and adventure.”\n\n“What I will miss the most about Andrews is seeing on a regular basis what God can do through humble, dedicated individuals,” he concludes.\n\nIn 1978, Marjorie Gadway moved to the Berrien Springs area with her husband and children. She applied for a job at Andrews University and was told that the preferred job was not available. Instead, she was offered a position as a supervisor for the Custodial department. “I was kind of scared because I didn’t know what to do,” she explains. “I didn’t know how to be a supervisor.”\n\nMarge was also nervous because she is naturally a shy person. She remembers praying, “Lord, I don’t think I can do it, but you know me better than I know myself and if you think I can do it, I’ll take it.” She says, “Evidently he knew me better than I did because I got the job.”\n\nMarge had not anticipated that she and her family would move from Massachusetts to the Andrews area. She remembers an amusing conversation she had with her daughter who was deciding whether to visit Michigan with a friend. Marjorie and her husband told their daughter to make the trip as she wouldn’t have a chance to see Michigan otherwise.\n\n“We didn’t figure we’d have the opportunity to come here. We were busy at other schools. We didn’t know anyone here,” she says. “When we came we thought we’d only be here three years and then go back to New England.”\n\nNow Marge realizes that the Lord had other plans for her life. At the time of her retirement in November 2019, she had served in her position for 41 years. “I’m so thankful that I did. I couldn’t have had a better job,” she says.\n\nHer typical work day often involved visiting several of the campus buildings under her supervision. While the number of buildings and student workers shifted over the years, Marge most recently supervised seven buildings: Bell Hall, Marsh Hall, Hamel Hall, the Alumni House, Sutherland House, the Horn Museum and the Information Services building. In addition to monitoring the buildings, she would also check on her student workers, replenish any needed supplies and attend meetings with the other supervisors and managers.\n\n“I love the students and that they’re from all over the world. You get to know them and some of their countries. They’re like my kids. Some of them call me mom, some even grandma,” Marge says. “I just love them and the people that I work with, the other supervisors and the manager. They’re my family, my second family.”\n\nMarge has also enjoyed getting to know some of the faculty and staff members in the buildings she supervised. When she visited the buildings she often took the chance to greet those she met.\n\n“It’s such a pleasant place to work, to spend time,” she says. “I like the Christian atmosphere.”\n\nIn retirement, Marge plans to spend time on her hobbies which include sewing and painting. For now, she and her husband are planning to stay in the area, but they may move to be closer to their children in the future.\n\n“I never thought I would be doing what I’m doing now,” says Christine Carlson of her job at the Office of Financial Records as the accounts payable supervisor. “When I started working here, I was an extremely shy person who could hardly pick up a telephone.”\n\nDuring her 33 years at Andrews, Chris has worked in a variety of areas around campus including Dining Services, Keys & Supplies, the University Post Office and, most recently, the Office of Financial Records.\n\nAs the accounts payable supervisor, her responsibilities included ensuring that all the University bills were paid on time, communicating with companies, handling reimbursements, filing records and attending to the needs and concerns of students. “If I get tired of doing one thing, I can always stop and do something else. No day is predictable. It’s like detective work,” she says. “I’ve loved every minute of it.”\n\nChris also worked extensively with training student workers at Financial Records. During the training process she often relied on her own experiences to help students become more comfortable with necessary office skills such as talking on the phone. “I give students a step-by-step guide of what to say. I can understand what they’re going through because I’ve been through that myself,” she says.\n\nThroughout her time here at Andrews, Chris has enjoyed developing meaningful connections with students. She loves baking and often brought cookies to share with the student workers. Even though she is retiring, she hopes to continue doing this.\n\n“I have appreciated so much my students and their relationship with God and concern for others. Watching them grow, from when they come and when they leave, it’s been a real blessing,” she says. “I will miss my students.”\n\nIn addition to her student worker community, Christine has also cherished the support and friendship of her fellow staff members. “Even when things have been difficult, I’ve had support and camaraderie from several people in many of the places that I’ve worked. They all took care of me,” she says.\n\nChris listed several Bible verses that have been an encouragement throughout her career. One of them is Philippians 1:6, which says, “And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns” (NLT).\n\nAfter retiring, Christine will stay in the Berrien Springs area. She hopes to spend more time with her grandchildren and do mission work. Christine plans to use her fabric and yarn to make lap robes, baby blankets and baby outfits for places like homeless shelters, hospitals and nursing homes. She may even volunteer at a soup kitchen. “As long as I can, that’s what I want to be doing,” she says.\n\nDonald and Rebecca May have spent their entire professional careers together at Andrews University for the last 40 years. In fact, their work history at Andrews goes back even further—they found themselves working together at the laundry as freshman students in the fall of 1973. “We initially met in a freshman class and were in a study group together! So our relationship with Andrews goes back 47 years,” says Rebecca.\n\nBoth Rebecca and Don’s parents were committed to Adventist education and joyfully provided them with Adventist education from 1st grade through college. “They held Andrews in such high regard and were so proud when we were both offered positions at Andrews soon after finishing our degrees,” recalls Rebecca. “We were naive to the amazing professional adventure we were about to embark upon!”\n\nIn 1979, Don had just finished a degree in photography from Rochester Institute of Technology when Greg Constantine, then chair of the art department, called to see if he would be interested in teaching photography for the art department and the College of Technology design program. “I will always be grateful to Greg for his confidence in me,” Don says.\n\nDon accepted the position, started the photo program and taught for the next 20 years. He describes this time as some of his favorite years as he enjoyed helping students find their way professionally and academically. During this time Don was mentored by Merlene Ogden in conducting study tours, and he has since led more than a dozen tours during his career.\n\n“There is nothing that compares to having the intense time together with students and colleagues to absorb different cultures, take in the glory of God’s creation and deepen an understanding of academic disciplines,” he explains.\n\nDon was invited by Larry Geraty to provide photography leadership for Andrews archaeological digs. This launched the photo program as part of the broader academic community and was a great opportunity for the students to develop connections that could lead to possible future employment. Many of the photo graduates have since made amazing contributions to the visual life of the Adventist church by filling positions at the Adventist Review, in Adventist healthcare and teaching in Adventist schools.\n\nAfter teaching for 20 years, Don was invited to serve as assistant dean for the College of Arts & Sciences. Initially he also remained in the classroom but transitioned full-time to administration in 2003. “I’m particularly grateful for my professional friendships with Niels-Erik Andreasen and Jack Stout who nurtured my growth and affirmed my abilities to serve in administration,” he says.\n\nDuring his time in administration Don carried out a variety of activities such as assisting with University strategic planning, student retention initiatives, the freshman experience, student success initiatives and serving at-risk students. His career evolved, and he retired as assistant provost for undergraduate initiatives.\n\n“Achievements I look back on with satisfaction include developing the photo degree program, photo tours that morphed into general education tours, iVue, May Express, and First Stop. My contact with students and their parents to smooth an academic journey was always my greatest privilege,” Don says.\n\nOver the past 12 years Don has also had the opportunity to be the director of the Andrews Core Experience (general education). He has enjoyed working with his colleagues in this critical part of the academic experience.\n\nRebecca’s Andrews career began in the red brick house that was the former president’s residence. There she served as secretary to the director of Public Relations. “I was destined to immerse myself in the history of this campus right from my first day of employment! The longevity of my employment at Andrews has provided a rich opportunity to meet the leaders and support staff who have, with God’s guidance, made Andrews University what it is today,” she says.\n\nRebecca remembers standing on the porch of the office/house with two former presidents and occupants of the house, Percy Christian, for whom that home was built, and Floyd Rittenhouse and hearing their stories and laughter about “the good old days.”\n\n“It’s amazing to think that I was personally acquainted with seven of our presidents and worked on inauguration ceremonies for three of them,” she says.\n\nIn 1986, Rebecca moved to the other red brick house on campus where she became director of Alumni Services. The job description had been recently expanded and she found herself developing programming, friendships and plans with alumni across the country and globe. She also worked with auspicious volunteers from the campus community including Steve Vitrano, Leona Running, Paul Hamel, Loren Hamel, Daniel Augsburger, the Hamblin family and Paul Kantor.\n\nRebecca was always fascinated to hear stories of Andrews’ earlier days as Emmanuel Missionary College. She even had the opportunity to meet the great-great-granddaughter of J.N. Andrews. “Over the years my soul has been knitted to the story and physical spaces of this amazing place,” Rebecca explains. “It has been such a blessing that my career here has provided the flexibility and opportunity to nurture my passion of Adventist education at Andrews University with its rich history.”\n\nSome of these opportunities she has been involved in include helping the University celebrate institutional anniversaries, unveilings, ribbon-cuttings, reunions and transitions. “I am deeply moved and get misty-eyed to see how God’s providence has been with us at each crossroad—and we know He will be faithful to our future! It hit me the other day that I have lived 47 of the 60 years of history of this institution called Andrews University! Yep—time to retire!” Rebecca says.\n\nAfter 18 years at the Alumni House, Rebecca moved back to “the other house” to serve as director of University Relations. She continued to love working with special events for the campus, finding ways to build campus community, affirming the accomplishments of employees, and inspiring faculty, staff, students and visitors with the history of Andrews as well as the huge potential to faithfully fulfill Andrews’ leadership role in Adventist education in the future.\n\n“No other Adventist institution has the potential to create World Changers like Andrews does,” Rebecca says. She also believes it is time for young professionals to use their skills and passion within Adventist education and hopes that her retirement will be helpful in making room for this.\n\nBoth Rebecca and Don have thoroughly enjoyed their careers at Andrews. “During 40 years of service to this campus, we are blessed with dozens of deep friendships nurtured over the years among colleagues, students, church members, and even throughout the world. Truly this has been our beloved community. We thank God for these relationships,” Rebecca says.\n\nDon and Rebecca have no immediate intention to leave the Southwest Michigan area, though they may seek warmer weather during any polar vortex. They both intend to be supportive to the new generation of Adventist professionals who will be shaping the future of Adventist higher education.\n\n“It’s all strangely exciting to imagine we have arrived at this time of our lives. We have started making lists of what we hope to do and be at this stage. Can’t wait to see what God has in store!” they say.\n\nGary Gray first came to Andrews in the fall of 1977 and enrolled in the Master of Divinity program. He considers himself deeply blessed to have studied with a stellar group of theologians—Fritz Guy, James Cox, Larry Geraty, Ivan Blazen, Walter Douglas, Daniel Augsburger, Abraham Terian, Steve Vitrano—who taught him how to think theologically, read the text carefully and evaluate theological ideas responsibly.\n\nWhen Gary left in December of 1979, pulling a trailer behind his car because he had acquired too many books, he had no idea he would be returning in the fall of 1990 to teach in the English department. Or that he would acquire so many more books. Gary had attended the University of Massachusetts/Boston to study literature because one of his college English teachers had inspired him. He says, “I wasn’t looking for a teaching job. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to learn that Andrews provided a stunning job benefit: a wife who was also an English teacher!”\n\nNot long into his Andrews tenure, Gary offhandedly joked that he and his wife, Meredith Jones Gray, should teach a course on the literature of love. After Stella Greig (then chair of the Department of English) stopped laughing, she urged the development of just such a class. Over the years, Gary and Meredith have taught some of the major texts in western literature on the topic of love.\n\n“Team teaching seemed to work for us,” says Gary, “so we also developed a course on C.S. Lewis. We realized that my wife had read his literary works and I had read some of his theological essays. With our students, we read both and enjoyed making connections between the two.”\n\nGary quickly discovered that Gary Land, a colleague in the history department, shared his fascination with the American game of baseball. They conceived of creating a class in which they would read and analyze some of the literary texts that had grown up with the game over the years. One of their major objectives was to get students interested in books, and they reasoned that baseball texts might just help students discover the pleasures of reading.\n\nGary’s background in both theology and literature suggested another obvious course: Biblical Literature. “Over the years of teaching this course, I have tried to connect the literary elements of the sacred text to theological and spiritual insights,” says Gary. “Hence, seeing the poetry as poetry, understanding how the imagery works, and probing the depths of similes and metaphors, etc., certainly helped to strengthen my faith; I hope it did for the students as well.”\n\nTeaching at Andrews also gave Gary the opportunity to focus his initially vague interest in nature literature and its “founding father” Henry David Thoreau. Gary comments, “I have discovered that his (and many other nature writers’) profound commitment to our environment strongly connected with my SDA heritage of seeing nature as a gift from a benevolent Creator. I also came to appreciate why my biology major father was so fascinated by the world of nature. And why he took me on so many Sabbath afternoon walks in which he did not ‘preach’ to me about the beauty of nature; I guess he assumed I would eventually ‘get it.’ Finally, after way too many years, I am starting to ‘get it.’”\n\nIn retirement, Gary hopes to buy more books with all the extra money he will have and maybe even find time to read one or two.\n\nAs a young man, Carey Carscallen envisioned himself becoming a shop teacher, so he completed his undergraduate degree in industrial education at Walla Walla University. While in school, he went to Zambia as a student missionary, doing maintenance and construction at Yuka Hospital. He was later asked to go back to Yuka Hospital for another year, which he gladly did.\n\nBecause of his service in Zambia, Carey was called to set up a technical high school in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly the Republic of Zaire).\n\nAfter four years there, Carey transitioned to Rwanda to help build and teach technical classes at the Adventist University of Central Africa. “That’s where my interest in architecture grew—between planning, building the University and teaching construction as well,” Carey explains.\n\nIn 1990, after six years in Rwanda, during which time Carey earned his master’s degree in industrial education, he and his wife Dorothy returned to the U.S. with their three children, and Carey began studying architecture at the University of Idaho. When Carey neared completion of his studies, Lew Siebold, then director of the Division of Architecture at Andrews, contacted him to teach once he finished his Bachelor of Architecture and Master of Architecture.\n\n“They wanted someone with a mission background to carry forward and expand the mission focus of the Division,” Carey says.\n\nTwo years later, Carey began work as assistant professor of architecture at Andrews. Twenty-two years later, he has held several positions within the School of Architecture & Interior Design, serving 18 years as director and dean and, most recently, associate professor.\n\nCarey has been grateful for his colleagues. “I couldn’t have asked for a better group of faculty to work with,” he says. He has enjoyed the service-oriented atmosphere, as well. “We are very overt with our students that the design talent they have been given is not only for self-expression but to serve God by designing spaces that promote the wellbeing of others. And, the buildings can be healthy, pleasing and affordable at the same time,” he says.\n\nWith work, Carey has gone on yearly mission trips. This time with students was one of the highlights of his Andrews experience. “They want to fulfill a mission of their own. They like what they see in our program and they support it strongly,” he says. “It touches you—that we’re able to do something out of the ordinary.”\n\nAnother highlight at Andrews has been reading Romans 12 with the students at the start of each school year. This chapter serves as a guide and reminder to remain humble and true to God.\n\nUnder Carey’s leadership, the Division of Architecture became the School of Architecture, then the School of Architecture & Interior Design. He oversaw the main architecture building expansion and wrote grants for multiple mission projects and the new shop for the school, where students can design and build tiny houses and renovate shipping containers into medical clinics.\n\nIn retirement, Carey will miss working with the students and faculty. He and his wife plan to stay in the area for now. “We want to travel to visit family and go on mission trips. That’s one thing I want to continue whether it’s with Andrews or otherwise.” He remains thankful to God for the opportunities he has been given to serve others.\n\nSpencer Carter first arrived at Andrews in 1973 as a proud alumnus of Northeastern Academy in New York City. He earned his BS in communications and his master’s degree in what was then known as community counseling. After graduation, Spencer worked for nine years as the program director at a local counseling center in St. Joseph, Michigan, and then as an outreach counselor for the state of Michigan’s local Department of Social Services.\n\nDuring this time Spencer stayed active in the Andrews community. Many of his friends were involved there and his wife, Nancy Carter, taught for the nursing department. After the Meier Hall assistant dean, David Knight, transferred to Walla Walla College, Spencer started getting phone calls suggesting that he apply for the job. He prayed about it and felt impressed to look into it.\n\n“The rest is history,” he says. “It was in the back of my mind that I would do something at Andrews at some point. It was crystallized when the opportunity was presented.”\n\nSpencer began as the assistant dean of men for Meier Hall in 1993. This past December, 26.5 years later, he retired as the dean.\n\nHe credits much of his growth and success as a dean to the careful mentorship of Don Murray, former dean of men at Meier Hall. He describes Murray as a visionary and one of the grandfathers of deaning.\n\n“For Murray, residence life and deaning was a place where we could mentor young men and we could encourage them to partner with us toward their success: success academically, success socially and success spiritually. From day one I was introduced to how to build that kind of relationship with students,” Spencer says.\n\nAdditionally, Spencer is very thankful for his counseling background and skills. “It gave me confidence to sit down with students and be willing to listen, facilitate and help direct them toward what needs they had.”\n\nOver the years, Spencer’s favorite aspect of deaning was getting phone calls and emails from his former residents to tell him about their careers, marriages and children. “Those are precious moments that I’ll never forget,” he says.\n\nSpencer is also grateful for the relationships he built with his coworkers, including his fellow deans and Frances Faehner, vice president for Campus & Student Life. For him, Faehner consistently demonstrated quality leadership with an emphasis on care. “As a team we were together through the highs and lows. We got a chance to see each other’s hearts,” he says. Being an active part of this team is what Spencer will miss the most in retirement.\n\n“The time I’ve spent here has been the biggest blessing in my professional life. I learned a lot about leadership, a lot about myself and a lot about programming,” Spencer reflects. “I learned a lot about God’s leading and guidance—how when we are committed to letting Him guide and lead us, He will give us opportunities to be a blessing. That’s always been my prayer, ‘Can I be a blessing to somebody?’”\n\nNow that he is retired, Spencer will remain in the area with his wife. He plans to enjoy vacations, work on several projects and remain active in his local church.\n\nIn honor of Spencer’s dedicated service at Andrews University, the chapel in Meier Hall was recently named the Spencer Carter Chapel.\n\nRita Pusey always knew she wanted a job or career that involved service. She received her BS in education from Andrews University in 1972 and then started her career as a faculty member and girls dean at Union Springs Academy in New York state. When her children were born, family became a priority.\n\n“I left the professional world for a while to be a full-time mom and during that time did some work as a substitute teacher and licensed daycare provider. I went back to full-time work when my youngest was 8 years old,” says Rita. She worked for 13 years at the Edward Lowe Foundation in Cassopolis, Michigan, before her current position as an administrative assistant in the Doctor of Ministry program at Andrews.\n\nWhen Rita transitioned from a secular work environment to Andrews University she noticed the difference. “It seemed like a rare privilege to attend chapels and staff worship as a part of my work day. To be free to drop everything to pray together with staff or students—whether for their needs or mine—has been a wonderful thing,” she says.\n\nMany things have changed at Andrews over the course of Rita’s employment, both in the physical building of the Seminary and in Rita’s work teams. When she was hired, the program had only one director and herself. Now there is a director, four full-time staff and a graduate assistant. There were slightly over 100 students in the program when she began, and currently there are about 350 ministry professionals at varying stages in the program. She has worked with four directors during her tenure, and Rita states, “I have learned valuable things and appreciated working with each one.”\n\nRita’s job has been to guide and assist students through their educational program but, Rita adds, “Many times they have graciously ministered to me. The job involves a great deal of tedious detail that must be conscientiously attended to, but the purpose of it was to take care of people who are ‘working on the front lines.’ That is our part in the bigger picture, and it is a privilege.”\n\nShe has greatly appreciated the nurturing work environment and wonderful colleagues who have become her good friends. She relates one event in particular. “When my son-in-law was killed in a plane crash and I needed to take extended time off to support my daughter, my colleagues pooled some of their vacation time and donated it to me. What they did was unexpected and a loving gift that was very meaningful to me.”\n\nRita will remain in the area to tend to the needs of her 99-year-old mother and assist her building contractor-spouse with a major church renovation as well as renovations to their own house. She also hopes to support the evangelistic efforts of a Bible worker and literature evangelist who are providing leadership for outreach in their local community. Gardening, camping, hiking, biking and visiting their children and other family members across the country are in the plans, as are working on creative projects using a family archive of photos spanning several generations and writing stories of family history to accompany the photos.\n\nShe has been asked to provide occasional support with special projects for the DMin program on a contract as-needed basis, so she hopes to not completely “disappear” from Andrews quite yet.\n\nAbout seven and a half years ago, Margaret Howell saw a posting for employment on the School of Social Work’s website at Andrews University. She applied and became an assistant professor of social work. She also worked as the director of the graduate dual-degree social work program, coordinator of the school’s social work program, and faculty clinical trauma facilitator.\n\nBefore coming to Andrews, Margaret had worked in clinical social work and as a psychotherapist in a private practice. She also worked at Atlantic Union College as an associate professor of social work, lecturer in the theology department, and director of counseling services. Margaret had previously attended Andrews as a Seminary student and her son was a student at Andrews before she came.\n\n“I’ve always been driven by compassion for defenseless people, particularly children. I want God to use me to make a positive difference in people’s lives,” she says.\n\nThis drive to help others is evident in Margaret’s dedication to social work. Her favorite quote reflects this attitude: “I shall pass this way but once; any good that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being; let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.” (Etienne de Grellet, Quaker missionary)\n\nMargaret applied this passion to her work at Andrews. While here she helped to grow the dual-degree program between the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary and the School of Social Work—a project she had long been interested in doing. She also helped in the process of gaining state approval for the department and worked at trauma training graduate students.\n\nMargaret describes her time at Andrews as a growing process. “My areas of expertise have been strengthened, and it has been an energetic learning environment for me,” she says.\n\nNow that she is retired, Margaret is planning to stay in the area and do some consulting. She is enjoying her free time, reading, traveling more, spending time with her family, going to the gym and writing.\n\nMargaret will miss interacting with students and her coworkers even though she is enjoying retirement. “It’s a process, and I have to remind myself of that after working for so many years. I pray for the next steps in this process,” she says.\n\n“I’ve always found joy in every job I ever did,” says Keith Mattingly of his 40-year experience at Andrews. “What I particularly enjoyed is being able to play a role in effecting change that brings joy and improvement to other people’s lives.”\n\nDuring his time at Andrews, Keith taught in and chaired the Department of Religion & Biblical Languages, served as dean of the College of Arts & Sciences (CAS), and most recently was associate provost and dean of undergraduate education.\n\nKeith had never thought of being a teacher. He was pastoring at a church in Florida when his wife Margarita received an invitation to teach in the physics department in 1979. “She had sacrificed her career up till then to support me and I decided that it was her turn for me to support her even though there was no promise of employment by Andrews administration,” he says. That same year, though, he began teaching in the religion department.\n\nSince then, he has taught 25 different classes, including Issues in the Great Controversy, which he taught 35 times. Keith also started two classes which previously had not been offered to students in the religion department: Beginning Hebrew and Hermeneutics.\n\n“I really enjoyed teaching, it was very special,” he says. “I certainly had a great time with students in all my classes. In checking the record I’ve had the great privilege of teaching 5,741 students.”\n\nIn addition to teaching, Keith was involved in Chapel Choices, a program which provided multiple small groups for students to join. “I really enjoyed organizing and seeing to it that they worked,” he says.\n\nHe also served as the executive director of the Jordan Field School at Tall Hisban, Jordan, for two summers with Øystein LaBianca, senior director and professor of anthropology.\n\nKeith values the connections he formed with students during his time at Andrews and the relationships he witnessed between students. “I am often reminded of relationships built when I have the privilege to officiate at couples’ weddings,” he says. “It is especially pleasant to see students who have become somebody—we as teachers always want to see our students do better than we did,” he adds.\n\nHe appreciates, too, the staff who contributed to his positive experience at Andrews. “In terms of staff, I’ve enjoyed working with friends from Custodial, Grounds, Plant Services, University Communication, and ITS whose support made a gigantic positive difference in my career at Andrews University,” Keith says. “My peers in the religion department were great partners. The CAS dean’s office staff always exceeded my expectations, and without them I would never have lasted as the CAS dean.”\n\nWhile attending Broadview Academy in Illinois, Greg Offenback loved working on the 400-acre farm they operated so he decided to attend Andrews University to obtain a degree in agriculture. During his final quarter at Andrews in the winter of 1978, he received a phone call from Bernard Andersen, then department chair and farm manager. Greg says, “When he asked me if I would like to join the staff, he did not have to ask me twice! Bernard was very patient, kind and willing to work alongside the other staff, and we became great friends.”\n\nHe began working for the farm/dairy operation as an equipment operator in March of 1978, primarily operating and maintaining farm equipment, planting and harvesting crops for the dairy herd, and teaching classes in farm equipment and irrigation. In 1988 he became the field crops manager.\n\nIn August of 1992, Greg moved across the street to Transportation, where his primary job was operating heavy equipment used for maintaining roads and sidewalks, snow removal, underground utilities and excavation. He also drove buses and trucks, logging hundreds of thousands of miles to areas all across North America.\n\n“Aside from the day-to-day activities of the job,” Greg says, “working alongside and making friendships with others at the University and in the surrounding community has had the biggest impact on me. Even those who have been my superiors were more like friends than just a boss.”\n\nHe continues, “As a boy and young man a strong work ethic was instilled in me by various people, including my grandfather and academy farm managers. I have tried to maintain that work ethic. Family was the other aspect of life that has always been important. Sometimes the two conflicted with each other, and it could be a challenge to keep a balance between work and family.”\n\nSumming up his time at Andrews, Greg reflects, “If there is one thing I have learned it is that the only constant in life, besides our God, is change. Over the years there have been many changes at Andrews in personnel, administration, the physical plant, and even my job responsibilities. I have learned that rather than reject change to accept it and make the best of it. Often everything works out for the better. I am still learning this lesson every day.”\n\nGreg misses many of the day-to-day aspects of his jobs at Andrews, such as the planting and harvesting of crops that he did in his early years, but most of all he misses the people. Since he lives nearby, he still stops in and helps out from time to time with various activities.\n\nIn retirement, Greg most enjoys being in control of his own schedule, with more time to enjoy his many interests and hobbies. Those include motorcycle riding, antique farm engines and tractors, collecting and restoring vintage outboard motors, boating on lake Michigan and other inland lakes and rivers, and camping in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He and his wife plan to stay at their country acreage nearby and enjoy spending time with their two children, children’s spouses and five grandchildren who also live in the area.\n\n“It was one of those deals where it’s like you come to a fork in the road and you have to make a choice,” says Max Jardine, HVAC foreman and master electrician. “I made the choice to become an electrician, and I haven’t regretted it.”\n\nBefore beginning his career, Max attended Andrews for one year and took electrical classes. He returned to his home country Canada, participated in an apprenticeship program and earned his journeyman electrical license.\n\nDuring his years at Andrews, Max worked as an electrical foreman for approximately 10 years before switching to work at the power plant and HVAC.\n\nMax never assumed that this was the path his career would follow. “To be honest, I grew up around horses. I thought I would have a career in training horses,” he says.\n\nAlthough not expected, Max believes that God intended for him to be at Andrews. Max values the wisdom of Solomon in Proverbs and believes that wisdom is an important factor in any career. “If you want a guidebook on how to walk with God, you can’t beat the wisdom of Solomon,” he says.\n\nA particular memory which stands out to Max is the regular worship sessions Plant Services holds in the mornings—these include a song service, time to share prayer requests and then praying for each other. It provides a sense of community for the staff. “I enjoy waking up and coming there,” says Max. “That’s what makes you closer as a family, having worship together and starting the day off right.”\n\nPlaying basketball during intramurals with Andrews students was another source of fond memories for Max. “It’s kind of neat just to be able to still be out there doing that,” he says. “I wouldn’t have had the opportunity if I wasn’t at Andrews.”\n\nMax will miss the people he interacted with during his time at Andrews. “I guess the biggest thing it’s taught me is that it’s nice to have a family,” he says. “I’ve had some great people I’ve been able to work with. I can’t say enough about the impact. It has been a blessing to me. I’m glad for my time here.”\n\nIn retirement, Max may continue to make use of his contractor and electrical licenses. He also plans to go skiing with his wife in Utah."
