        "text": "It’s been a busy couple years for Meredith Andrews since her debut project, “The Invitation” released in April, 2007. She’s had top five singles, Dove Award Nominations and has toured the country with some of CCM’s finest (Aaron Shust, Brandon Heath, WinterJam, and an upcoming Fall 2009 tour with Michael W. Smith). Meredith has followed her heart for missions in Haiti and India, continued to pursue her passion for the church as Worship Leader at Chicago’s Harvest Bible Chapel, as well as recording her second project, “As Long As It Takes.” Heavily influenced by new experiences and by the people she’s met along the way, this body of work combines the power and passion of her amazing vocals with her heart for God and the people He places in her path."
