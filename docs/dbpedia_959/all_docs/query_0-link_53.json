The program begins with Craig Courtney’s poignant setting of A Better Resurrection by poet Christina Rossetti, and it is immediately followed by Johann Sebastian Bach’s Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten (“Ring forth, o songs, resound, you strings!”).\n\nThe contrast in emotions and musical styles from one piece to the other continues throughout the concert, concluding with Tom Trenney’s arrangement of Kathleen Thomerson’s hymn: I Want to Walk As a Child of the Light. The centerpiece of the concert is Elaine Hagenberg’s multi-movement work Illuminare; a multi-movement composition that express splendor, love, darkness, melodic tenderness, and radiance. The concert presentation of Illuminare is a Michiana premiere performance conducted by Cyril Punay. Mr. Punay is the assistant choral director during professor Stephen Zork’s spring semester sabbatical.\n\nThe Andrews University Singers & University Chorale are pleased to collaborate with members of the Andrews University Symphony Orchestra (Dr. Marc Elysée, conductor) for the presentation “From Darkness into Light”.
