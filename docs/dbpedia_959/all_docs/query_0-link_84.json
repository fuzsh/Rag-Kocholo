        "text": "With a knack for brokering luxury properties, Tal and Oren Alexander, brothers who worked as real estate agents, rose as high as the New York City penthouses they sold.\n\nThey built an image as jet-setting bachelors, filling their social media feeds with photos from Wimbledon, Art Basel and the beach in Mykonos. They took calls in between ice baths after sessions with their personal trainers. Their traditional good looks and magnetism attracted ultrarich clients who propelled the brothers past thousands of other agents to the very top of the ranks at Douglas Elliman, one of the largest real estate brokerages in the country.\n\nBut as the brothers partied and sold co-ops and condos from Manhattan to Miami, they were quietly earning another reputation: Accusations that they drugged and sexually assaulted women were spreading throughout the world of high-end real estate.\n\nStill, Tal and Oren continued to climb. They secured rarefied status in 2019 when they helped broker the sale of a nearly $240 million penthouse â€” at the time, the most expensive residential sale in United States history. By 2022, they had co-founded their own real estate brokerage, Official.\n\nThen in June, their reign as real estate princes ended. What had long been shared among brokers finally spilled into public view, after The Real Deal, a real estate trade publication, first reported that women had filed lawsuits against the brothers.\n\nTwo women sued Oren, 37, for assault, along with his twin, Alon Alexander, 37, who did not work in real estate but frequently socialized with his brothers. A third woman sued the twins as well as their older brother, Tal, 38. The brothers have denied all allegations of sexual assault, but Tal and Oren resigned from their own company.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
