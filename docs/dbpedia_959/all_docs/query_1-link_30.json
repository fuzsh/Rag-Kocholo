        "text": "For the week of Jan 22nd, 2024\n\nI’m not sure how they do it … you know people with Type A personalities. The ones that are so good at planning things out way in advance. The ones who get frustrated by people like me (Type B personalities) that are lucky if they plan days in advance. Perhaps their world is more predictable than mine. I remember someone asking me once what I was going to do in the coming week. I told them that it would be easier to get to the end of the week and tell them what I had done. Don’t get me wrong, I start every week with a “To Do” list, it’s just that sometimes I start the next week with the same list. It’s hard for me to know in advance what I will actually get done. The reality is, there is “limited visibility” regarding the future in my line of work. Life happens, ministry is needed, and I respond. And, I’m OK with that.\n\nI wonder sometimes what it might be like to be able to have a clear view of what is coming so that I could make a plan and see it through on schedule. I also wonder what it’s like for those who need life to be predictable … to be able to see out ahead … when the future is not so clear.\n\nEven I, who is pretty comfortable with the adventure of not knowing what is ahead, has admitted before that I don’t like driving behind large vehicles (I have a Prius so most vehicles fit this description). When I’m driving, I don’t like surprises. The deeply hidden “A” personality in me surfaces as much as that is physically possible, because I like to be able to anticipate whether or not I will need to slow down, change lanes, or change directions. In those moments I feel as though I have a sense of how other “A’s” feel.\n\nI knew as soon as I walked out of the house today, that visibility was going to be an issue. Seeing ahead was off the table. Anticipating my next move was out of the question. A dense fog had settled in across the Chicagoland area, and visibility was low. It was so thick in spots that I didn’t know if there was a vehicle in front of me, much less whether it was large or small. Life (aka my car) in those moments came to a crawl. Though I knew my intended destination, I could not be sure of my exact location or whether I was even headed in the right direction. There was one particular moment when traffic actually came to a complete stop, and I didn’t know when or if I’d be able to proceed. Call it coincidence, but in the very moment that my car’s wheels came to a stop, the song that began to play (I had my phone set to “shuffle”) was “I Surrender All.”\n\nI’d like to say that my ability to go through life flying by the seat of my pants, not knowing what might happen next, and not being overcome with anxiety has everything to do with my deep faith in God, but, if I’m being honest, it’s more likely the result of an annoying (to some) personality trait. That said, life isn’t just about road hazards and planned itineraries. To the contrary, life is full of crossroads, important decisions, uncertainties, unforeseen events … things for which a clear view of what lies ahead would be helpful, but things which are also often shrouded in dense “fog.” Those are the times when faith is all that we have. The knowledge that God is present with us. The fog may or may not lift, but we are not alone. It is in those moments when we experience “limited visibility,” that we are encouraged to surrender … not our uniqueness … not our giftedness … not our agency … but rather our fear and anxiety … our feelings of loneliness and abandonment … our sense of urgency for quick fixes.\n\nRemember, God sees what we cannot!\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Jan 15th, 2024\n\nYears ago, my family traveled to Paris for vacation in celebration of our girls’ respective graduations from college and high school. While on the trip, we took the opportunity to venture to the top of the Eiffel Tower. If ever there was a time to use the phrase “the view from here…” that was it. Short of being in a plane, it was the highest I had been (or ever hoped to be) off the ground. And, it was truly amazing. It was a clear day, and you could literally see for miles… in all directions.\n\nOn any given “typical” day in life, the view is much more limited. Even if there are no clouds or fog … even if the sun is shining…even when standing in the middle of a vast field where no trees are in sight… our view is limited. It’s limited by our life circumstances, our life experiences, our pre-conceived notions, our ability (or inability) to put the experience into words, and our willingness (or lack thereof) to be awed, surprised, transformed.\n\nThe reality is that we see what we want to see … what we have been conditioned to see … no matter where we stand or sit.\n\nLike the “nations” mentioned in the Judgment of the Nations (Matt 25:37-40 NRSVUE), we ask, when was it that we saw [those who were] hungry … or thirsty…? When was it that we saw … a stranger or [someone who was] naked …? When did we [see persons] sick or in prison? Though, if we leave the house on any given day, we encounter people who fit all of those categories, we are likely to miss them. Either we are not looking, or we choose not to see. That’s right, “seeing” is a choice.\n\nIn the 10th chapter of the Matthew’s gospel the disciples come to Jesus and ask why he speaks to the people in parables. His response to them is that the people have eyes but don’t see … ears but don’t hear. They see and hear what they want to see and hear. But to his disciples he says, “blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears, for they hear. Truly I tell you , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it…”\n\nIf we fail to see “it.” we will apparently not be alone, but neither will we be part of that to which God is calling us … creating a space in this world where the worth of all persons is a shared reality, rather than just one of a list of things found in a statement of belief … a space where the view is one of love and forgiveness, grace and mercy, justice and equality, unity and diversity, reconciliation and healing.\n\nWhat is the view from where you stand? Is it beauty and wholeness as far as the eye can see? Or, are there things awaiting notice, needing attention, requiring change? Is there hunger, thirst, isolation, nakedness, illness, imprisonment?\n\nIf the view from here is all darkness, you will likely drown in despair, but if the view from here is all butterflies and roses, you are likely missing something… perhaps even Christ.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Jan 8th, 2024\n\nIt’s kind of sad perhaps, but I, nearing 60 years old, still “play” the alphabet game when on a long road trip, or caught in rush hour traffic. If you’ve ever been on a long trip as a child, or with children, you have probably played the alphabet game, or something like it. Actually designed for more than one “player,” the purpose of the game is to find and call out the letters of the alphabet … in order from “a” to “z” … and to be the first to complete the alphabet. Any source is acceptable (license plates, bill boards, road signs, sides of trucks, mud flaps … anywhere letters appear. Of course, when there is only one person “playing,” calling out is not necessary.\n\nThe game is actually a great way to pass the time and/or to overcome boredom. It requires paying close attention to one’s surroundings, and can lead to seeing things you might otherwise miss. You might be surprised at some of the places that letters appear. And, as you might expect, there are certain letters that are available in abundance and others that are very hard to come by (J, Q, Z, and sometimes V) … especially in remote places. Consequently, there are times when the game goes fairly quickly, and other times when it seems the game will never come be over.\n\nLife can be a lot like the alphabet game. There are times when we go through life with all of the “letters” (answers, resources, gifts and talents, words of comfort, etc.) available to us right when we need them … everything in the proper order. But, there are also times when the one “letter” we need is nowhere to be found … hampering our ability to move forward … making it seemingly impossible to complete a task or achieve our intended/desired goal.\n\nHere’s the thing, some games have rules that are “set in stone.” Some games are competitive in nature, and lack the flexibility to find a better way. But, some games don’t require competition and actually work better when players work together. The same is true for life. In fact, although society would tell us that life, by nature and for the sake of survival, is necessarily competitive, we were created to be in community and to work together for the good of all. (I’ll pause for a minute to allow the more competitive readers among us to finish rolling their eyes.)\n\nI would actually argue that there are some “rules” in life that are set in stone … love God, love your neighbor as yourself, pray for your enemies, forgive and forgive again, take nourishment, remain hydrated, get adequate sleep/rest, don’t cause harm to another, and pay your taxes. (I know, I may have missed a couple, but you get the idea). I would also argue, however, that many other rules are manmade and therefore flexible.\n\nImagine a version of the alphabet game where the goal was to work together to complete the alphabet as many times as possible during the duration of the trip… where instead of being in competition for the “letters” … especially the difficult to find letters … we combined our efforts, shared our “letters,” and celebrated our victories together. Now, imagine that same approach to life.\n\nUnrealistic … possibly, but isn’t it worth a try?\n\nPossible … absolutely, but only if it gets started somewhere. How about with us!? That’s a “game” we all can play … children, adults (even those approaching, or long past, 60)\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Jan 1st, 2024\n\nOn Thursday of last week, December 28th, there were churches around the world that celebrated or acknowledged what is known as “Holy Innocents Day.” It is a day in which many in the church universal remember the children (all males under the age of one) who were killed at the order of King Herod. It is a story found in the Gospel of Matthew following the birth of Jesus. And, though it is an extension of the birth narrative, it is more a tale that shows what can happen when fear and envy and insecurity are allowed to thrive in our hearts… when power and control become the object of our desire and when the fragility of such desires are threatened by the smallest of things … even a child.\n\nYou and I are not kings and queens. We do not have power over kingdoms. One might think that the things we do control are of such little consequence that we might never fear the loss of those things enough to add to the list of “holy innocents” in an effort to hold on to them. But when we are challenged … when the things we value (family, possessions, rights, etc.) are in danger … the “mama bear” comes out … in all of us. In those moments, thoughts of peace fall to the wayside… concern for others takes a back seat. Our instincts kick in and we protect what is ours with a ferocity that does not consider fallout, collateral damage, lost relationships, or the presence of “holy innocents.” Those reactions are, of course, justifiable … or so we convince ourselves. But what about the little things we do unintentionally … things that don’t leave a visible mark, but hurt just the same.\n\nThe reality is that every decision and/or action that we make, or fail to make has the potential to leave “holy innocents” in its wake. That is not to say that we kill innocent children with those thoughts and actions, but simply that our thoughts and actions always affect others in some way.\n\nThe official Day of Holy Innocents has come and gone for this year, but the number of God’s children who keep being added to the list will continue to grow as long as there are those who put power and control over people and collaboration … self over “other” … “us” over “them.”\n\nA change has to start somewhere. Perhaps, in this new year, we all could just take a couple of minutes each day to pray for the “holy innocents” (adults and children) of our world (past and present) and to attempt to “see” them as our brothers and sisters, worthy of our compassion and attention. Maybe we could even take a moment to consider the ways in which we may have contributed to the number of holy innocents through our actions or inactions … through the things we said or didn’t say. I dare say that through our care and attention, we could begin to bring about change … one holy innocent at a time.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Dec 25th, 2023\n\nAs we close out this year and prepare for the unlimited possibilities awaiting us in 2024, it is good for us to find a balance between remembering all that has transpired, good and bad, in our lives over the past year, and maintaining our hopes and dreams for what can be. In order to bridge the gap between past and future we need to be consider what matters most.\n\nIn Community of Christ, we know that it is ultimately Christ’s mission that matters most. That said, there are many tangible ways to get at that. I found the following in the most recent edition of the Magnolia Journal. It is the Magnolia Manifesto, and it is entitled “We Believe:”\n\n“We believe in home, that it should restore us from today and ready us for tomorrow. We believe in friendship, because friends who feel like family are the best kind of friends, and that nothing matters more than family. We believe in seeking the balance between hustle and rest and learning to find contentment in both. We believe everyone deserves a seat at the table and everyone has a story worth telling. We believe in human kindness, knowing we are made better when we all work together. We believe in courage, in cartwheeling past our comfort zones and trying something a little bit scary every day. We believe that failure needn’t be a negative thing; rather, we learn from our mistakes and fail smarter next time. We believe in doing good work that matters and, in choosing that, nudging others toward doing the same. We believe that newer isn’t always better and that it’s time for the pendulum of trend to swing back to the basics. We believe in unearthing beauty, however hidden or subtle it might be. We believe that each day is a gift and that everyday miracles are scattered about if only we have eyes to see, and of all heroic pursuits large or small, we believe there may be none greater than a life well loved.[i]\n\nYou may or may not agree with all of the statements found in the Magnolia Manifesto. That’s OK. What is important is that you take time to reflect on the things in which you do believe, and then to be intentional about making them a part of how you choose to approach life going forward.\n\nWhat are your “non-negotiables?” How is it that you contribute to the building of God’s peaceable reign on earth? How might you need to shift your thinking or alter the way you engage others and the world in order for your others to know what you believe without you having to tell them?\n\nI encourage you to take some time to carefully consider these questions as well as your responses … not for the sake of creating new year’s resolutions that will disappear after a couple of weeks … but rather for the sake of transforming our world.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\n[i] Joanna and Chip Gaines, Editors, Magnolia Journal, November (Winter) 2023. (Des Moines, IA: Meredith Operations Corp.), 108.\n\nFor the week of Dec 18th, 2023\n\nIf you’ve been reading my blog for very long, or you’ve heard me speak, you may have heard me talk say, “be careful what you sing!” I think that we often simply sing along with familiar songs, whether they be on the radio or out of the hymnal, without thinking about the words. Like many things, after we do them so many times, they become more habit than intention.\n\nSongs on the radio might only require caution if you listen to non-“rents” stations. For those who have no idea what a “rents” station or playlist is, that’s a station or playlist that you use when your parents are around (no swear words, no “inappropriate” references to women, body parts, late night activities… you get the idea). Hymns, however, are more likely to require caution … at least they ought to. That’s because hymns often include words of commitment, promises to act, heartfelt confessions, and the like.\n\nHere’s the thing, even though I have told others to be cautious, I still find phrases in songs that I have sung hundreds of times which surprise me… phrases that have come out of my mouth but apparently never passed through my brain … before or after. Such a phrase hit me this past week as I was listening to Christmas music on the radio. Now, a couple of things… first, I realize that the phrase is not from the scriptures and didn’t come from God, and, second, I’m probably the only person who has never picked up on the implications of the phrase, but…here goes…\n\nThe song is “Joy to the World,” and the phrase that captured my attention for the first time ever is from the third verse:\n\nHe rules the world with truth and grace, and makes the nations prove the glories of his righteousness and wonders of his love, and wonders of his love, and wonders, and wonders of his love.\n\nThe phrase … “He… makes the nations prove the glories of his righteousness and wonders of his love.” With a little digging (thank you internet) it seems that there has been a lot written about the hymn in general and this phrase in specific. I wish I had a good excuse as to why it took me so long to pick up on the challenge I find in this phrase… God has done, and continues to do, marvelous things in our world, and in our lives … but because God has chosen not to force our hand, or require us to choose God, the world has often chosen other gods. Perhaps it is because they remain unconvinced regarding the glories and wonders of God. Is there a chance that what the “world” has seen from those who call upon God’s name has not been all that glorious or wonderful? Unfortunately, the answer is yes… at least for many of the non-believers I have met and with whom I have talked.\n\nWords of Counsel given to Community of Christ in 2013 encourage us to “not just speak and sing of Zion. Live, love, and share as Zion.” (Doctrine and Covenants 165:6a). I believe the same can be said about joy. It is not enough to sing about joy to the world. We must also live, and love and share with the world the joy we know because we have been transformed by the glories and wonders of God’s love and grace.\n\nAs we close in on Christmas, consider letting your gift to the “world” (or at least to those you encounter on a daily basis) be living proof of the transforming power of God in your life … the source of your true joy!\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Dec 11th, 2023\n\nIn the last week, I have gained some new insights into myself and my need to approach patience differently. For some, perhaps, patience comes naturally. I have certainly known people in my life who exhibited great amounts of patience with others (yes… “others” includes me.) I guess I’ve just always thought that patience is like athletic or musical ability… some people have it and some people don’t. I’ve heard tell that there are persons whose “natural” ability is so natural that practice is not even necessary. One thing is certain, I’ll never know for sure since I’m not one of those people.\n\nThat said, I have been able to develop new skills throughout life … with practice, aspiration, and intentionality. That’s where my new insights into self and patience come into play. In most things, children being one exception, my “natural” level of patience is somewhere in between my natural athletic ability and my natural musical ability… nearly non-existent. I do believe, however, that even I have the ability to grow in patience… but not without those three key elements … practice, aspiration, and intentionality.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I forget sometimes that what is “obvious” to me, is not always obvious to others. I should know better. I can’t even count the times when it has been me for whom something was not obvious. So why then, you might ask (I certainly did) did it take me a couple of days into my recent visit back home to realize that I was allowing myself to get frustrated with having to explain myself over and over again regarding … in my mind … an extremely simple task. That’s easy … because I’m human, and I forget.\n\nI forget that we are all on a journey. We have all traveled different paths to get where we are physically, emotionally, and spiritually. We have all had different life experiences that have informed and possibly transformed our beliefs and understandings about life … the way we see the world and each other. I’ve written before about the passage in scripture where Jesus tells Peter that he must go above and beyond with forgiveness, forgiving others “seventy-seven times” (Matt 18:22). I’m learning that the same may be true for our exercising of patience with one another.\n\nWe live in a crazy time where division is prominent. It seems that we are encouraged by outside forces to focus on the things that divide us… withdraw into our own spaces … surround ourselves with those who affirm our convictions… and demand our rights regardless of what it might cost others … even those we love. However, we (you and I) can aspire to something better … something more hope-filled … something more loving. There are certainly plenty of opportunities to practice patience with one another (even regarding the simplest of tasks)… remembering the things that are most important … our connections … our relationships … our common humanity and the fact that we are all children of God.\n\nNo doubt, for some of us at least, it will not come\n\nnaturally. It will take intentionality.\n\nBut, whatever it takes, it will be worth it. We are worth it. Those we love are\n\nworth it. And, if Jesus has anything to say about it, even those who “trespass\n\nagainst us” are worth it.\n\nI encourage you to pay attention to how you respond to “frustrating” encounters this week. Take time to consider the life circumstances, worldview, physical and mental ability, and even the culture of the one(s) who are causing your frustration. Maybe you, like me, will gain some new insights.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Dec 4th, 2023\n\nThis first appeared in From the Desk of… n December 2017. Today I passed a bell ringer that was the exact opposite of the one described here, and it reminded me of how much difference a “bell ringer” can make in your day … perhaps even your life…\n\nWe’ve all seen them…and avoided them! They come out during the holiday season and run interference at our most popular stores. Last week, after arriving at the grocery store near my home, I sat in the car and watched for a little bit. I wanted to see how people respond to the Salvation Army bell ringer. My interest was peaked specifically because this was not the average bell ringer…you know the ones that stand by the bucket ringing their bell and looking at people as if they hated being there just as much as the passersby hated them being there…\n\nJanice (not pictured above, and name changed to protect the enthusiastic) sang, danced, and greeted every guest with a sincere “MERRY CHRISTMAS!” Though it was hard to avoid making eye contact with her, the number of people who managed to do so was astounding. It’s interesting how many women had apparently lost something in their purse right before they got to the door and entered while looking for the missing item(s)…or the number of people who found something in the upper right corner of the door frame so captivating that they had to stare…in the direction opposite of Janice.\n\nIn spite of the rejection, Janice didn’t give up. Her smile never cracked. Her singing and dancing continued on cue (not to be confused with “on key”… LOL). She would not be dissuaded from her task. She was determined to bring joy into the lives of others.\n\nA few days ago, in the midst of a bit of a frustrating day, I stopped at a different store (several miles from the first) only to find a dancing, singing, joy-filled bell ringer awaiting my entry. Yes…it was Janice and the only thing that had changed was her location. I stopped to talk to her, and asked her why she had changed locations, and though she never answered that question (perhaps she was too joyful for the clientele of the first store), she seemed amazed that someone had recognized her…and even more so that someone took the time to speak to her. But I wanted her to know that her enthusiastic presence was just what I needed that day. She thanked me, gave me a hug, and wished me an extra special Merry Christmas.\n\nThe point of me telling this story is that I was reminded in the moment how the simple act of “noticing” the presence of a person may mean more to them (and us) than we can ever imagine. Let’s face it, there are lots of “nameless” and/or “faceless” people in our communities…people who have been made to feel that they don’t matter or that they are not as good as others…and they don’t all ring bells at Christmas. They live in our neighborhoods, go to school with our children, work in our offices, and sit beside us in our pews.\n\nThis week, I challenge you to think about the “bell ringers” in your life. Who is it that causes you to search in your bag or stare at the door frame when entering a store? Maybe they dance a little crazy or sing off key. Perhaps they stand by their bucket waiting for you to toss in your loose change. But, more importantly, maybe they are a glimpse of Emanuel… “God with us”…sent by God to see if we’ll notice.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Nov 27th, 2023\n\nA new cycle of the Christian year began this week. A time of waiting has commenced. It is supposed to be a time of anticipation and expectation filled with hope and peace and joy and love, but sometimes I wonder if those feelings are lost in the holiday hubbub. That may even seem natural since, In any other circumstance, it might seem odd to equate a time of waiting with such positive feelings. Anxiety might seem more appropriate. And, it doesn’t help that our culture tells us we don’t have to wait…even that we ought not to wait. After all, we now have the ability to obtain what we want as well as what we need with the click of a button. We don’t even have to leave the house. If we plan it right, we can have “it” the same day … two days at the most.\n\nSo why wait? Why are we willing to accept the waiting of Advent, when that’s not how we most often approach life? Perhaps it’s because we already know how the story turns out. This is a story we’ve heard before. We know what’s next without having to “turn the page.” There are no surprises. We know that the “package” that is on its way will be exactly as advertised. There is no return policy because none is needed. In the end, the problem with knowing how the story ends is that it allows us to take the “waiting” for granted… so much so that we’re not actually waiting at all… at least not for that which the Advent season promises.\n\nI heard a story a few days ago. It was a story told by a young woman who had experienced homelessness as a child. She, her younger sister, and their mother were homeless for a little over a year during her time in middle school. In telling her story, she related the sense of desperation she had felt each day while sitting in the shelter waiting for food … waiting to find out if they would receive a temporary housing placement … waiting, not knowing what to expect on the next page of their story, much less how the story would “end.” For her and her family, waiting wasn’t a season with a pre-set happy ending, it was a way of life, and it rarely included hope, or peace, or joy … or even love.\n\nIt is my hope and prayer this Advent season that you will think about those whose whole life is spent waiting … for acceptance, for food, for shelter … to have hope, to know peace, to experience joy, and to be loved. Take time during Advent to do a little waiting yourself. If necessary, pretend you don’t know how the story turns out. Live with a sense of anticipation and hopeful expectation. Let yourself be surprised by what’s on the next page.\n\nThe Christmas story has been written for a long time, but in your waiting you may find a few surprises that birth something new in your heart. Remember, your story is still being written.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Nov 20th, 2023\n\nWe’ve often joked in our family that if you do it once, it’s tradition. Needless to say, we have started many traditions in our family. So many, as a matter of fact, that it’s hard to remember them all. But one thing that remains strong in our memories is that all of our traditions include doing something fun or special together as a family. Of course, life changes … the kids grow up and start their own families (and their own traditions) … and we learn to adapt … creating new traditions (aka…. excuses to make more memories together) that fit the changing world and our changing circumstances.\n\nWhen our children were young, we thought traditions needed to be big events … providing some wow factor that our children would look forward to with great anticipation. In those early days, “big events” were synonymous with “costly,” so we had to pick and choose carefully. However, one of our cherished traditions, which started when our kids were 14 and 6, was to drive an hour on Thanksgiving night in order to be at a huge outlet mall at midnight when Black Friday began, and then stay up all night shopping and browsing (more browsing than shopping). It was made special by the booths serving free hot chocolate, the rush of finding amazing “one-night-only” deals, and the carolers that strolled through the crowd with their joyous tunes.\n\nWe continued that tradition for fifteen years … long after the hot chocolate was no longer free, the deals started days if not weeks in advance, and carolers were no where to be found. With the kids “grown,” hot chocolate was replaced with a mid-morning (3am) break at our favorite coffee shop, and the outlet mall was replaced with targeted, well thought out treasure hunting in specifically identified stores scattered around town. Now, of course, “Black Friday” happens mostly online. But, I like to think that, even if the stores still opened, we’re smart enough to choose our traditions and our together time more wisely. No more all-nighters … just quality time together over a meal or a cup of coffee, around a fire, playing a rousing game of Bananagrams, or simply by way of phone or internet.\n\nIn spite of our changing lives, our family still has the tradition of staying connected. It’s a tradition that is vital to the well-being of every human being, because we are created to be in community. Not everyone has a traditional family like ours, but I hope and pray that most can (and should) have those they identify as “family.” We’ve learned that “big event” doesn’t have to mean costly. Rather, it can be as simple as a picnic at a favorite park, coming together to bake cookies, carving out time for a weekly video phone chat, sending postcards to loved ones from random places, having a gingerbread house decorating contest, taking a drive to look at Christmas lights … anything … as long as you stay connected.\n\nAt Thanksgiving, I am especially mindful of just how blessed we are. Our family grieves for those around the world who are battered by war, poverty, oppression, food and water insecurity, abuse, global warming, and countless numbers of other things. We are keenly aware that we have suffered none of those things, and that we have a responsibility as Christian disciples, not to mention fellow human beings, to do what we can to make our world more just and inclusive.\n\nEven as I write this, I realize that it is easy for us to talk about tradition in grand terms because we have the freedom and resources to do so. For this reason, I do not take family or traditions for granted. So whomever you consider to be your “family,” make a plan to connect with them. If possible, make it a regular “big event.” Who knows, it may become one of your favorite traditions.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Nov 13th, 2023\n\nAs the headlines continue to be filled with stories of war, division, and mass destruction around the globe … as many of us quietly watch while hundreds and thousands of people lose their lives in atrocities carried out by others in response to conflicts and disputes that have existed since before their birth … and as the definition of what constitutes an “enemy” is expanding before our eyes at a record pace in response to the blatant disregard for others … the command of Jesus to “love your enemies” seems to be slipping from our grasp and our consciousness.\n\nMy own personal journey of discipleship has led me to be in concerted prayer for those on both sides of the conflicts that are commanding global attention, yet seem not to have clear paths to resolution. It is in that context of struggle that I offer these words which are taken from Bishop Jake Owenby’s blog, “A Jesus-Shaped Life: A Reflection on Matthew 16:13-20.”\n\n“After Sunday worship at one of the congregations in my diocese, I met with the church’s leadership for the standard review of finances, attendance figures, evangelism strategies, and the like. One of the leaders was visibly angry. He said nothing until we came to the “Other Business” item at the end of the agenda. Referring to my sermon, he said, “Where do you get off telling us to love our enemies? They’re our enemies! They’re dangerous. We have to defend ourselves.”\n\nTaken aback, I couldn’t think of anything to say. Several seconds passed. The priest of the parish broke the silence. “The Bishop was quoting Jesus. Those words are from the Sermon on the Mount. It’s in Matthew’s Gospel.” My critic didn’t respond, but he was still fuming and remained unconvinced.\n\nJesus is neither a coercive drill sergeant nor a micromanaging boss. He is a wise friend. Wisdom is the art of navigating life’s complexities. Nobody is born wise. And advanced age does not guarantee wisdom. Nevertheless, we acquire wisdom over time if we acquire it at all. Opening our heart, mind, and soul to a person who possesses wisdom is crucial to learning it. We become wise by patterning our lives on how a wise person walks through this world on their ordinary days. How they think, feel, and act in a variety of situations.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that the wise don’t merely observe the world around them and figure out its patterns all on their own. Instead, they spend a lifetime connecting with the very source of the creation’s deep, governing algorithm. Their lives are shaped by the habitual practices of worship, prayer, study, works of mercy, and the pursuit of justice. These practices open us to God’s presence in our everyday lives.\n\nIn other words, Jesus shows us how to live. What he teaches us in the Sermon on the Mount and in his many parables and by his personal example may upend some of our fiercely-held assumptions or rein in some of our strongest impulses. But when we recognize that we need a mentor to be fully human—to live into being the image of God we were created to be—we’re admitting that there’s much that we do not know and more than a few things that we’ve gotten wrong along the way. God knows that we’re a work in progress. That’s why repentance is one of Christianity’s traditional practices. We need to admit our missteps and shortsightedness to ourselves over and over. Not to get God off our backs. But to accept the helping hand we’re always being mercifully offered. Besides, once we finally realize that God has accepted us all along, loving our imperfect self gets a lot easier.\n\nIn short, I suppose that we say who Jesus is by living a Jesus shaped life. By passing on to our neighbor the love that God keeps giving us no matter what.”[i]\n\nI don’t know who you might consider to be your “enemies.” Hopefully, the list is short. Either way, it is my prayer that you (and I) can live a Jesus-shaped life … admitting the things we don’t know, seeking knowledge and understanding of the suffering and struggle of others, and finding ways to love the lovable and the “unlovable” (aka. Our enemies).\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\n[i] Bishop Jake Owensby, “The Jesus Shaped Life,”https://jakeowensby.com/2023/08/18/a-jesus-shaped-life/.\n\nFor the week of Nov 6th, 2023\n\nWho knows why certain things happen to people? Some would say God planned it … some would call it fate … some say coincidence. Personally, I can only say that I don’t know. However, no matter what we find to be a suitable answer for any given incident or event in our life or in the lives of the ones we love, there is one thing that I believe … God is always present with us in the midst of the events of our lives, and often helps us to find hope, comfort and light if we will only open ourselves to the moving of God’s spirit.\n\nHere’s an example…\n\nAs I went about my usual mid-week duties, I couldn’t help but notice how many times someone switched lanes (often without a signal) on short notice and into a gap that was not intended for their vehicle. Granted, I spend an inordinate amount of time in the car on Wednesdays, so the odds of this happening are higher than on other days. That said, I believe that today was worse than usual.\n\nBecause I’m not typically a conspiracy theorist, I don’t believe (at least not deep down) that these people were doing this to aggravate me personally, and I don’t believe that God put them in my way. I don’t even believe that I deserved this behavior because I wasn’t living “right.” I did consider, at one point, however, stopping my car and getting out to see if someone had put a sign on my car requesting that people cut me off and then slow down. If it hadn’t been raining … who knows?\n\nAnd then there was that inner voice (more like a fleeting thought) that said, “slow down.” Each time someone filled the gap between myself and the vehicle in front of me, I had to slow in order to avoid an accident. There were a couple of times when I had to come to a complete stop. Though my heart wanted to offer grace, my mind kept trying to rationalize why the other driver felt it necessary to drive the way they did … dangerously … without thought of others … selfishly seeking to get “there” first. So much for grace. But God knows my heart and my mind, and, in time, I wondered if maybe, though… again, I don’t believe God made them do it, God might be encouraging me and nudging me to take the hint … to slow down … to make space for others.\n\nFor those who prefer to be the center of things, this should be good news. Rather than allowing me to obsess about how the actions of the others were inconveniencing me, God was helping me to turn the focus on me and see the teachable moments in the events of my life so that I might use them to be a better disciple, a better companion, a better father, a better minister, a better person. Imagine that … they drive like maniacs and I’m the one that has something to learn. Not to worry, I’m sure God can do the same for you if you’re open to it. You see, God doesn’t have to physically intervene in our lives to move us toward our created purpose. All God has to do is accompany us through life’s challenges, joys and struggles … which God does … and quietly nudge, prompt, and encourage us to acknowledge our shortcomings, admit our need to grow, open our hearts to receive, and offer our lives in service to God and the building of God’s kingdom. It is there… in centering ourselves in God, not in judging others … that we find the hope, comfort and light that God has promised us.\n\nMaybe it doesn’t matter why things happen. Maybe what matters is what we learn from those things, and how those things affect how we move forward. So… slow down. Listen to God. Make space for others. And… what the heck … focus on yourself for a few minutes. In the end, you’ll be better prepared to handle life, walk with God, and fulfill your God-given purpose.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Oct 30th, 2023\n\nIt was not your normal All Hallow’s Eve (Halloween). Though our family has had a tradition for the last 20 years to set up a fire pit in the driveway and sit around the fire while we wait for the children to come seeking candy, I can’t remember a Halloween in recent history where the fire was a necessity rather than just a fun thing to do. This year, however, it was necessary. At least for those brave enough (or dumb enough depending on your perspective) to hang out outside for the duration of the event.\n\nI realize that Halloween is not a “holiday” that everyone celebrates, but I loved it as a child, and I love it still. As a child, I loved it because I think it was the only time we were allowed to have candy … certainly it was the only time we were allowed to have that much candy). I love it now because there is nothing better for the soul than to see children so happy and excited. The wide-eyed joy of a child when they hold their bag open and hear the candy making its landing, is something that brings me joy. And we don’t limit our candy to children. Anyone, as long as they are in some kind of costume … even a mask, can have candy.\n\nThis particular year, my wife and I joined our daughter and son-in-law at their new home. It was their first Halloween, as a married couple and as home owners. Because of the freezing temperatures and falling snow, there were some candy seekers who seemed more drawn to the fire than to the candy. My son-in-law jokingly told some of the older kids that they could either have candy or get warm by the fire. Some of them were actually willing to sacrifice the candy and stand by the fire. In the end, they got both. There were even a few who returned a couple of times for additional warmth.\n\nAs we neared the end of the trick-or-treat time “window,” and the number of passers by started to dwindle, we were surprised when a group of high-school aged young men in costume made their way to the fire. They too got their candy, and lingered by the fire for an extra minute or two. Then, as they left, we noticed an individual standing with their bike out at the sidewalk, rubbing their hands together, glancing toward the fire, but apparently not feeling comfortable to come up the drive to where we were sitting … perhaps because they were not part of the trick-or-treat crowd.\n\nWe invited the person to come up and get warm. As it turns out, the person was a young adult … a young woman who probably thought the fire was only for us or for those who were out gathering treats. She quickly accepted our invitation, and joined us beside the fire. Her smile was just as broad and her appreciation just as deep (perhaps deeper) as the children who had received candy.\n\nThis young woman had not come with a bag seeking handouts. All she longed for was an invitation to join our circle and benefit from the warmth and welcome that she found there. She had no expectations of us, nor we of her. She only stayed for a brief time. All that we know about her is that she had forgotten her gloves at home, and that she still had a bit of a ride ahead of her.\n\nAs I watched her return to her bike with a smile on her face, I couldn’t help but think about all those in our world that could benefit from an invitation to join the circle of warmth and welcome that we know as companions on the journey with Christ … even for a brief period … without expectations, without judgement … no costume or mask required.\n\nWho is waiting for your invitation to come and share the warmth that you have found in community with Christ? Will they need a costume or a mask in order reap the benefits of what you have to offer?\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Oct 23rd, 2023\n\nTraveling around the interstates and highways that pass through the Chicagoland area, I see so many billboards. Because I often travel the same ways week after week, I’ve gotten to the point where I rarely even pay attention to them. Some, because they have no bearing on my life, but mostly because they’ve just become a part of the “landscape.”\n\nToday, however, one that has been around for a while stood out for me. This particular billboard advertised a religious attraction, but it wasn’t because of the billboard’s inherent religious nature nor the attraction it was promoting that drew me in. It was the words, “Make the Journey.” You might ask yourself why that phrase would capture the attention of a person that spends a lot of time on the road. Perhaps you too are one that gets a lot of “car time.” Here’s the thing, I make a lot of “trips” here and there, running errands, visiting people and congregations, and addressing the needs of others, but I rarely take the time to make “the journey.” There are even times when I arrive at a place I’ve been to so many times that I didn’t even think about how to get there… I just did. One minute I’m leaving my house, and the next, I’m arriving at a location 30 or more miles away, with little or no recognition of the things I’ve passed along the way.\n\nBut, as I passed the billboard today, it was as if something or someone was telling me to slow down, pay attention, listen, watch, take note … don’t just “get there,” make the journey. All day, the phrase floated in my mind… like a tune of a song that get’s stuck in your brain and won’t let go. My response, at least initially, was, “I don’t have time to slow down, or make a journey for that matter.” And then I had an encounter with the cashier at the supermarket where I had stopped to buy the food for our weekly food program. The “encounter” began as I waited in line for my turn to check out. I watched as this woman took time to make each customer … even the one that interrupted her mid-customer to ask a question … feel that they were the only person in the store and the only task on her list for the day. Some might have been frustrated by the fact that she didn’t just hurry and do her job, and perhaps on any other day I might have joined them in their frustration. However, today was anything but frustrated. I left wondering if that was her way of “making the journey.” I wondered if taking the time to show interest in others, instead of giving in to the press of other tasks, made as much of a difference in those with whom she interacted as it did in me.\n\nI have always marveled at how unshakable Jesus was when encountering persons in need while on the way to attend to some other pressing task. Even though his disciples tried to get him to move along … to make the trip, Jesus always seemed to choose instead to “make the journey.”\n\nI don’t know about you, but it’s something from which I would do well to learn.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Oct 16th, 2023\n\nI’m always looking for signs of hope in today’s chaotic and oft divided world. It is especially exciting to me when that hope is made manifest through the lives of young people. Let me explain…\n\nAs a church leader, I find myself spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how the church is being called to live out its purpose in a 21st century, post-pandemic, context. If there weren’t already enough reasons why church was losing its relevance to younger generations, the pandemic proved that they (we) could survive isolation, or at least compensate for it by creating community in new ways … ways that didn’t necessarily require “church” community. Being a technologically savvy generation allowed young adults to easily transition into new ways of being together … ways that make space for everyone to belong and to be themselves … without fear of judgement.\n\nQuite honestly, those types of communities … those ways of being … are hard to find within the church. I believe that every one of us, regardless of our age, long for that kind of community. But, when we are together in church, we feel we have to be a certain way … to have things all together … to judge others quickly, lest they judge us first! (Wait a minute… I think what Jesus said was, “Do not judge, so that you may not be judged. For the judgment you give will be the judgment you get, and the measure you give will be the measure you get.” Matt 7:1-2 NRSV).\n\nWhat if we could be together without judgement? What if we left that to God, and spent our energy on finding ways to build one another up, celebrate one another’s triumphs, encourage one another in times of trouble, and rejoice in the fact that we have those with whom we can share life?\n\nLast weekend, I was at yet another wedding. The wedding was for one of my daughter’s closest childhood friends. It just so happens that the bride’s family are some of our closest friends as well, because of the time we spent together in community. One of the best parts of the wedding event for me was the reconnection with people who played a significant role in our lives and the lives of our children for 10 years. Though we have been gone from that place for 10 years, it was as if time had stood still. For the older adults in the crowd, though that reunion was awesome, it was not unexpected. With the exception of the inevitable effects of age, not much had changed for us.\n\nFor our children (now adults in their own right), however, much had changed… engagements, weddings, college graduations, careers, cross-country moves. And yet, they too picked up where they had left off. The absolute highlight of the weekend was when, between two popular dance tunes, the DJ played “Big House” by Audio Adrenaline. It had been a camp favorite for these young folks from elementary through high school. As soon as the song began to play, the energy level skyrocketed. In an instant, we were back at camp. But something was different. I watched as the group naturally expanded to include the newly added significant others. No one was left out. Everyone belonged. It was impossible to tell the “camp kids” from the “new arrivals.”\n\nNot only did that night fill me with hope as I watched those young adults, now living in far flung places in various walks of life, it confirmed for me that God’s house is truly a “big, big house” in which everyone can find welcome no matter where life takes them. It proved to me that the time spent in building sacred community is never wasted. And, it challenged me to make sure my life mirrors that hope and the unlimited welcome of God’s “Big House.”\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Oct 9th, 2023\n\nSo let’s be clear… I did not, obviously, experience The Great Depression, nor am I a Depression Baby… by a long shot. Let’s also be clear, I am by no means a hoarder. That said, it seems that no mater what size house I live in, I am more than able to fill it with the things that family members have either collected, saved for posterity, found impossible to let go of … just in case, or apparently bought because it was too good of a deal to pass up. (Notice that none of those “reasons” include the word need.)\n\nGrowing up, it was things like magazines. I’m pretty sure my mother had every Southern Living and Good Housekeeping ever published. Then, of course, there were all the sentimental pieces (furniture, jewelry, china, silverware, and clothing (and I’m not talking about stuff that might come back in style!) left behind by previous generations. And, I’m not judging. Yes, I have a couple of items passed down from great-grandparents. Though my wife has told me many times that to get rid of something doesn’t mean you don’t love the person to whom it belonged. But still…\n\nAs a parent… until our last move three years ago, our storage room was filled with every drawing, school paper, report card, etc. that either of our daughters had produced. There were boxes of clothing packed up and saved…by size… from our first daughter in case any future child might be interested. Who wouldn’t assume that children born eight years apart would be interested in the same clothing styles? Even if not, surely the next generation could use them…right? Well, according to our daughters, the answer is an unequivocal NO! Needless to say, those items did not come with us in the last move.\n\nSo, how did our current house start filling up? Could it be “just wants and needs?” Well, some of it has to do with needs. Most of it, however, has to do with “just wants,” as in “I just want it.”\n\nI’d like to say that I am alone in my “collecting,” but one need not go far from home to see that I am, in fact, not alone. As I drive around the Chicagoland area, I cannot help but notice the amount of land mass that it taken up by self-storage companies. They are everywhere and they come in all shapes and sizes. You might expect to see them in densely populated urban areas where houses are small and yards are smaller… or where homes don’t have basements. But, that is not the case. There are more self-storage properties than there are grocery stores.\n\nAgain, I’m not judging … anyone other than myself. I don’t have a storage unit now, but I have in the past. I know that I have way more than I need. I often pass it off by saying that I am blessed, but the reality is, I’m more than blessed. I’m spoiled. It’s easy for me to look at billionaires and wonder, how much could they possibly need to acquire before they’re happy?” But, aren’t I the same? Perhaps I need to give some intentional thought to Jesus’ words as recorded in Mathew 6:19-21:\n\n“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust[b] consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\nI don’t want my heart collecting dust in a storage room, or even in a nearby closet. If I’m going to let it be about “just wants,” I need to let it be about what God just wants… not only for me, but for everyone and everything in God’s creation.\n\nHow about you… where is your heart?\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Oct 2nd, 2023\n\nIt was a beautiful Sunday morning. My destination was not unfamiliar nor was the normal path that I took to get there, but on this day, I decided to put the address in the GPS and see what path it would choose for me. To my surprise, the recommended path was not the path that I would have normally taken. In fact, the GPS directed me down back (country) roads. I was totally dependent on the GPS as I had no idea where I was most of the time.\n\nIt was an early morning ride, so there was no traffic at all. There was a light fog hovering over the fields of corn and soy beans. The sky was bright blue and the colors of literally everything were accentuated and enhanced by the uninhibited rising sun. There were some picturesque and even breath-taking views as I wound my way through a place I had never been. Even though I knew the rush and chaos of city and suburban life was probably just beyond my line of sight, it truly seemed hundreds of miles away.\n\nNow if you’ve ever been for a country drive through farmland, you know that there are mostly wide open spaces where trees are few and far between. Such was the case on this morning. However, at one particular point in the drive, I came upon what appeared to be a large forest, but in reality was only a large stand (about an acre) of trees and surrounding undergrowth. The minute it came into view, I was immediately reminded of the phrase “you can’t see the forest for the trees.”\n\nOf course, that phrase it not typically used as a compliment. Rather, it reminds us that we too often get caught up in the minutia or details of a issue, project, or problem that we are unable to see the larger picture. Ironically, in that moment, it was both the “forest” as a whole that caught me attention… not the individual trees. Here in this “forest” was an incredible display of diversity, and, I would argue, a sacred “community.” There were trees of all sizes and shapes and varieties. There were numerous shades of green and other bright fall colors, and some trees whose limbs were already bare. There were trees bent by wind and age, and others that stood tall and straight. And below the trees was a similar diversity of undergrowth and young saplings.\n\nThe image that was created was one of beauty, but to the casual onlooker and to the naked eye, it might easily be mistaken for something much less than it was. Here was a representation of a supportive and effective community. The root systems of those trees were surely as vastly diverse as the trees they upheld… each one not only supporting its tree but other surrounding trees as well. The undergrowth, part of the forest least favored and most likely to be removed, was not only providing protection against soil erosion, it was also serving as a cover for the decaying ground cover that provides nutrients essential to the health of the whole ecosystem. Each one of the diverse participants in the community contributing in different yet critical ways to the beauty I was able to witness.\n\nWe can learn a lesson from the forest and the trees. In order to form sacred community and create the “beauty” of a world where all can thrive (which we believe to be God’s will and plan for creation), we need diversity … we need each one to fulfill the purpose for which they have been created, utilizing their giftedness for the health of the whole … and, we need to work together. When we allow our stories and our lives to be woven together, we form a strong “root system” that supports the community .\n\nCan’t see the forest for the trees? Remember, if it weren’t for the trees (and the undergrowth, and even decaying ground cover for that matter) there would be no forest.\n\nWatch for a “forest” this week, and pay close attention to all that is needed to work together to create beauty.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Sept 25th, 2023\n\nPrior to becoming a full-time minister, I spent a number of years in the restaurant/hospitality industry. During those years, I worked in a variety of different roles, for a variety of different restaurants. However, it was in the last restaurant for which I worked that I learned the true value of great customer service. It was there that I saw first hand the benefit of treating each person who entered the restaurant with dignity … as a guest rather than a customer. In fact, my mentor in those days shared that he treated every shift as if he were hosting a gathering in his home, and everyone (with the exception of the employees of course) was his guest.\n\nI believe it was because of his philosophy, and the policies of the company which supported his philosophy, that we had as many “regulars” as we did occasional visitors. Rarely was there a meal time that guests didn’t have at least a short wait for a table. Not surprising since the food was good and the hospitality was even better.\n\nIt’s a fairly well-known fact in the hospitality industry that in order for a restaurant (especially a locally owned restaurant) to thrive if not simply survive, it needs that “thing” that sets it apart. In most cases, that “thing” is a memorable specialty food item or cuisine. One of the reasons I never attempted to open my own restaurant was the fact that I didn’t have a specialty. That said, I was reminded this past weekend that there might just be another “thing” that would might be just as helpful. Let’s be clear, it’s not a new thing, it just happens to be a thing that is hard to find. My mentor knew the secret to success all those years ago. People just want to be treated like they matter … maybe even a little special.\n\nThe reminder came when my wife and I entered a café at a high-end club which we wouldn’t otherwise have been able to enjoy, had it not been for the incredible generosity of a good friend. Here we were, two “fish out of water,” trying not to stand out. We were greeted warmly, ushered to a table, and taken care of as if we owned the place. Our every need was met with incredible professionalism and without any hint of judgement as to our status or worthiness to be there. Watching the employees interact with other guests confirmed that everyone was treated the same, and It felt really good.\n\nWe live in a world where our differences have come to hold more weight than the things we have in common. We are divided by more things than we can count (skin color, gender identity, economic status, religion, political affiliation, age, geography, and the list goes on). It seems that every day there are new labels being created in order to lift up one group while holding down another. But it doesn’t have to be that way!\n\nThe reality is that we are all God’s children… worthy of love and acceptance, dignity and respect … valued by God beyond our wildest dreams … created for the purpose of experiencing joy and abundant life in concert and cooperation with one another and with creation. What if everyone could have an experience like my wife and I had? What if we always treated one another as guests and family (loving family, not quarreling siblings)? Heck, even being treated as customers would be better than being treated as objects to be put down and/or discarded.\n\nAll this time I had the “thing” within me that could have made my dream for my own thriving restaurant a reality. And, all this time we’ve had the “thing” within us to make God’s dream for a thriving, mutually enriching world a reality. We just need to start using that “thing” (a belief in the worth of all persons and a knowledge of God’s unconditional love for all of creation) to bring God’s dream to life.\n\nThe Isley Brothers said it well … “It’s your thing, do what you want to do.” Better yet, do what God wants you to do.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Sept 18th, 2023\n\nWhen I was a child, I was taught that church is where God is. And, because our family was at church at least twice a week (Sunday morning and Wednesday nights), that is when I expected to encounter God … if at all. Consequently, I didn’t look for, or listen for, God outside the church walls. Now that I’m all grown up (in age at least) and have served in ministry for the last 30+ years, I have, of course, learned that God is never far. As a matter of fact, when I am paying attention, God “shows up” quite often.\n\nAdmittedly, I can go days without an identifiable moment where God’s presence is made obvious… not because God has taken a break, but because I have allowed my attention and focus to be centered elsewhere. Ironically, perhaps, “elsewhere” is usually on church business… or should I say church “busy-ness?” It’s hard to believe that getting caught up in the business of God “stuff” can actually distract one from God’s presence is they are not careful.\n\nAnd then there are weeks like this week. It started with a Sunday sermon focus scripture, Romans 14:1-12, in which the Apostle Paul encourages the church in Rome to welcome those who are weak in the faith (that includes not only persons new to the faith, but also those who have been around a while but have become too comfortable with the status quo). In the passage, Paul acknowledges that members of the community will likely disagree, but most of the things about which they disagree (what to eat, what day to worship, what color carpet to use, etc) will be insignificant in the grand scheme of things. After all, what matters is that we love God and love neighbor as ourselves. As I prepared my sermon for that day, I was constantly running across examples of “neighbors” who didn’t feel loved or accepted … those who didn’t belong.\n\nDays later, while packing bags outside the church for a weekly food program, I had the opportunity to sit down and talk with a young man who had fallen on hard times. It was clear that the young man needed someone with whom he could talk because the conversation was neither quick nor superficial. During our talk, I topic of having a support system came up. I asked him if he belonged to a supportive community (family or church). He said he was estranged from his family because of previous poor decisions on his part, and he wasn’t a part of church because “people like [him] don’t fit in with church people.” He didn’t feel that he belonged. Of course, I told him he was loved by God and would be accepted at the church where I was working, but even after our time together, it was pretty clear that he wasn’t convinced. That had not been his experience.\n\nAnd then today … I was on the road for a prolonged period of time and was listening to a podcast whose description sounded interesting enough to get me to try it out. The podcast was produced by a group from San Diego, CA called Sojourn Grace Collective. Apparently, the group is in its last days, and as a part of their most recent podcast they played a couple of “gratitude moments” from persons who were thankful for the welcoming and inclusive safe space this ministry had created for people who otherwise have not felt that they “belonged” where Christianity is concerned. One of the persons sharing a “gratitude moment” shared six very profound (what I would call gospel-connected, divinely-inspired) words that they would take away from their time participating with this ministry. The words were, “If you are breathing, you belong.”\n\nIf you are, or ever have been, struggling with the thought that you aren’t good enough, haven’t done enough of the right things, or have done too many of the wrong things to have seen or heard from God, first look in the mirror and you will see God because you have been created in the image of God. Then, hear this … it doesn’t matter what you believe, what you wear, how much you earn, who you love, what you’ve done or not done in your past … you are a beloved child of God. If you are breathing… you belong!!\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Sept 11th, 2023\n\nI have often told my children that they can’t control how people will treat them, they can only control how they choose to respond. Perhaps you’ve heard the story of the Potatoes, the Eggs and the Coffee Beans. It seems that it’s been around for a long time, and there are many variations to the story. Being a visual person, I appreciated the image that this story creates. It was the first time I had heard the story. The following includes a version of the story and comes from beginwithyes.com…\n\nEvery day that we live on this earth we make choices. Things happen, we make decisions, and that shapes our life. It’s that simple, but do we put enough thought into how we react to things that happen to us? Sometimes we’re so busy that we just react rather that think. As with many things, a slight pause will create a moment of increased awareness of the words we choose to speak or the actions we choose to take. This affects every single aspect of our lives, and it’s especially true in relationships.\n\nHere’s a short story to help you remember that how we respond to situations is our choice…\n\nOnce upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn’t know how she was going to make it. She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.\n\nHer father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot. He then let them sit and boil without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He took the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup.\n\nTurning to her, he asked. “What do you see?” “Potatoes, eggs and coffee,” she hastily replied. “Look closer”, he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.\n\n“Father, what does this mean?” she asked.\n\nHe explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity – the boiling water. However, each one reacted differently. The potato went in strong, hard and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak. The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard. However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.\n\n“Which one are you?” he asked his daughter. “When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean?”\n\nThe moral of the story: In life, things happen around us, and things happen to us. The only thing that truly matters is your choice of how you react to it and what you make of it. Learn, adapt and choose to make the best of each experience.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Sept 4th, 2023\n\nSeemingly small insignificant leaks can become cause of major issues if left untended. Take it from a guy who came home from a work trip recently to find some “minor” water stains on the wood laminate flooring of our downstairs bathroom. For the record, I am fully aware that wood laminate flooring is not the best idea for a bathroom, but it’s what was there when we bought the house a couple of years ago. And, until the leak, it was fine… until it wasn’t.\n\nAt first glance, I thought it would be a simple fix requiring the replacement of the toilet’s wax ring… a job I estimated would take 15-20 minutes. Of course, I realized there was a chance that a small area of flooring might have to be repaired/replaced since the laminate flooring was likely to have absorbed water, creating a perfect environment for mold growth. However, even taking into account the time that would be required to go to the store and purchase a few replacement floor pieces, the job still shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours. If only the flooring was still available, but it wasn’t. And, to top it off, the flooring didn’t end at the door to the bathroom. I was going to have to find another solution altogether. Now I was looking at a days-long project minimum.\n\nLet me be clear, the bathroom hadn’t flooded, but what started with a small insignificant leak ultimately required not minutes or hours or days to repair. It took weeks. Baseboards, cabinet, and countertop had to be removed so that the whole bathroom floor could be replaced with tile. Wall paint messed up by the removal of caulk had to be repaired and repainted, and adjustments had to be made to account for the new floor height. If only I had noticed the leak a little sooner. Argh!\n\nSure, I could have cut corners along the way. For instance, I probably could have found flooring that was a close match to the original. It would have, after all, been mostly concealed by the replacement of the toilet. But, I just wasn’t willing to settle for “good enough.” I’m actually glad I took the time to do it right… to get the right materials and to carefully attend to every detail so that the floor would withstand future leaks without becoming a problem.\n\nI’m sure you won’t be surprised, but this whole thing got me thinking. This time about relationships. It doesn’t take a “flood” to do major damage to our relationships. Sometimes a small insignificant “leak” can cause just as much damage as a flood. Like the leak in my bathroom, the damage isn’t always clearly visible. Sometimes it eats away at the foundation of the relationship, absorbing negativity and creating favorable environments for spores of resentment, anger, and even hate to grow and multiply.\n\nHealthy relationships require that the right foundation (flooring) be laid, and that attention to detail be paid along the way… not just when “stains” begin to appear. Even though it took a long time, I was able to fix the problems in my bathroom. That may not always be the case with our relationships.\n\nLet’s face it, “leaks” are going to happen. We’re going to mess up. We’re going to say things we wish we hadn’t, or things we never intended to be hurtful. We’re going to do things (or not do things) that will undermine our relationships … because we’re human. And because we’re busy humans there will be times when stains may begin to form. What’s important is that we don’t let them go untended. Leaks don’t often stop on their own, and stains don’t typically go away. The sooner we catch the leaks, though, the more likely we will be able to stop them. The sooner we address the stains, the more likely we will be able to remove them.\n\nGod created us to be in relationship. If we start with the right materials and attend to the details, our relationships are more likely to withstand the leaks without becoming a problem. Trust me, it’s worth the time and effort.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Aug 28th, 2023\n\nI remember a conversation with close friends many years ago in which we discussed what our outside spending limit was for a pet. Our friend’s dog was dealing with some health issues at the time and they were struggling with how much they were willing to spend for treatment… for a pet. Given that both we and our friends were young and relatively new to our careers (that’s code language for “we didn’t make a lot of money”), it may not come as a surprise that our threshold was pretty low. Basically, we were willing to get the necessary annual required vaccinations, but if anything “serious” came along … well…\n\nFast forward 20 plus years to where we are now. This week, one of my days started off with a trip to the veterinarian because our puppy had a number of issues that needed to be addressed. I won’t bore you with the details, but suffice it to say that had the old spending thresholds remained in place, our pup would have been available for immediate adoption. I did find myself half-jokingly asking him if he thought he was worth the expense. He looked up at me with his adorable eyes and loving smile as if to say, “must you ask?”\n\nThe truth is, with few exceptions, our family is full of avid dog lovers. Because of that, and our shared affinity for adorable Instagram posts that feature dogs (especially puppies, Labrador retrievers, or Golden Retrievers), we are often sharing posts back and forth in an unspoken competition to see who can find the most adorable or funny or inspirational. While taking a moment to browse through my feed this morning, I ran across an inspiring post meant to describe humans with pets (as you will see, “pet owners” doesn’t apply here).\n\nAccompanying the images of a golden retriever named “Maui” was the following voiceover…\n\n“In Hawaiian, you don’t call yourself your pet’s owner. You are their “Kahu.” Kahu has many meanings. Among them, guardian, protector, steward, beloved attendant…basically someone entrusted with the safekeeping of something precious, something cherished. What a kahu protects is not their property, what they protect is a part of their soul.”[i]\n\nOf course, it solidified my resolve and justified my expenditure (there was no way I would put him up for adoption!). His adoption into our family is a lifelong covenant.\n\nThe post also reminded me of the immense worth of all of creation in God’s sight. The Holy Spirit is, by this definition, our “Kahu.” We are the “something precious… something cherished.” We have been adopted into the family of God and it is a lifetime (forever) covenant. There is no price to high to pay, no threshold by which God’s love for us will be bound our limited. God is a part of us and we are a part of God. God would never put to us the question, “do you think you’re worth the expense?” We need not use our “puppy dog eyes” or our beaming smile to gain God’s love and protection.\n\nIf anything, it is us who find ourselves wondering whether or not we are worth it. And, in our wonder, God says, “must you ask?”\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\n[i] Instagram, @maui_thegoldenpup\n\nFor the week of Aug 21st, 2023\n\nI have always been pretty good at directions… finding my way from one place to another, and, once I’ve been there, remembering the way back. Twenty years ago, however, I found myself assigned to an area of the United States where some of the cities were difficult to navigate. Towns and communities were nestled in valleys surrounded by meandering ridges that all looked the same. Rather than neatly arranged intersections where two streets cross at perpendicular angles, I found myself encountering intersections where three or more roads came together at the same place. Lucky for me, GPS technology for general use was became available around the same time. And I quickly became dependent on GPS technology to keep me from getting lost in those cities. I now use the GPS every time I get in the car, though it is often for the purpose of getting an ETA for my trip.\n\nSeveral years ago, my wife began using an app on her phone to replace her GPS. I was hesitant to switch over because I was used to the GPS and had rarely been led astray. It had nothing to do with the fact that if I switched, I would have to admit that my wife found “a better way.” Well, I recently used the app and found it’s “real time” suggestions for alternative routes to be very helpful. Apparently, the app can see the bigger picture and, because it knows where traffic jams, construction, and slow downs are, it is constantly evaluating other routes and making suggestions for altering your path.\n\nRecently, I was headed to an event with family and friends, and, even though I had been to the venue many times and was very familiar with how to get there, I decided to use the highly recommended app and to follow it no matter where it led. (For the record, I also put the venue in my GPS so that I could compare ETAs). Suffice it to say that the question, “why are we going this way?,’ was expressed numerous times during the trip. We were directed down side roads … led on and off the freeway … and generally taken on a behind the scenes tour of the city. There is no way I would have been able to repeat the route in reverse, nor explain the reasoning behind the directional choices. But… we made it to the venue without delay and ahead of the time suggested by the GPS.\n\nWho knows what time we would have arrived if we went the way we usually go? But my guess is that if we had gone the way we thought we were supposed to go, we would have been late the event venue.\n\nThe same is true in our journey with God. In a recent Instagram post, @russelldafourth, tells of a similar GPS experience he had while taking his dad to a doctor’s appointment. In the post, he comes to the realization at “this is kind of like how God does us. We think we know the way. And, because we think we know the way, when God [leads] our lives in a direction that we never thought we would go. We start thinking that we’re further behind… we’re not going to get where we’re supposed to get. What I love about God is [God’s] vision is not like our vision. We can only see to the corner, but God sees around the corner. We can only see to the mountain, but God sees over the mountain. So there are some things that God is [leading] us to and because we don’t understand it, we think that we’re being delayed… To trust God is not just to trust [God’s] plan for your life, but also to trust [God’s] route and [God’s] timing.”\n\nAre you set in your ways, or are you willing to place your trust in the ultimate GPS (God’s Positioning System)? With a little faith and trust, there’s not telling what you might encounter along the way that you otherwise would have missed.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of Aug 14th, 2023\n\nSomeone recently sent me an Instagram “reel” that I thought was worth sharing. Though I believe it’s a message that is generally beneficial to everyone, I think it is especially important for those attempting to maintain spiritual health and wholeness. It’s also important for those, like you and I, attempting to bring to reality God’s peaceable kingdom.\n\nIn the Instagram Reel…\n\nA professor, holding a glass of water, asks his students,\n\n“How heavy is this glass of water?” Several students take a guess at the weight\n\nof the glass. “8oz… 12 oz… 16 oz.” Then, the professor continues…\n\n“The absolute weight of the glass doesn’t matter. It depends\n\non how long I hold on to it.\n\nIf I hold it for a minute nothing happens.\n\nIf I hold it up for an hour, my arm begins to ache.\n\nIf I hold it all day long, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed.\n\nWell, the weight of the glass hasn’t changed, but the longer I hold on to it the heavier it becomes.\n\nThe stresses and the worries of life are like this glass of water.\n\nIf you think about them for a little while, there’s no problem.\n\nIf you think about them a little bit longer, it begins to hurt.\n\nIf you think about them all day long, you’ll feel paralyzed … incapable of doing anything.\n\nAlways remember, put the glass down.”[i]\n\nLong ago, someone told me that when we refuse to forgive, we give up a part of ourselves. One might argue that, when a relationship is broken because of a misunderstanding or a hurtful word or deed, both parties suffer. But the reality is that it is the one who cannot or will not forgive … the one who holds the grudge … that suffers the most. One might also argue that they can just move on… that the relationship doesn’t matter … that they are better off without the offender in their lives. And, to a certain degree that may be true. However, it is also true that the lingering anger, envy, or hurt on to which one holds takes space in their hearts and souls that might otherwise be occupied by love, grace, and generosity.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I have experienced that personally. Some time ago, I had a disagreement of sorts with a group of people. For a while following the incident, both sides (yes that includes me) held on to the hurt and the idea that any fault lay with the other person(s). Fate and circumstance did not allow for either side to simply move on. Continued encounters were inevitable. And, with each encounter, the hurt and disappointment were combined with anxiety. I can’t speak for the others involved, but for me, it became a block to my ability to engage in ministry with the same joy I experienced in other settings. By not “putting down my glass” (aka offering grace and forgiveness), I was in some ways paralyzed. I was essentially giving away a part of myself, and, as a consequence, I and my ministry were suffering. The day finally came when I could set pride aside and admit that it was time to forgive and to ask for forgiveness. It was time to put down the “glass.” All I can say is that the result was liberating. The part of my heart that I had allowed to be held hostage by another was returned… the possibility of reconciliation became a reality.\n\nIs there a “glass” that you need to put down? Are you willing to set aside your pride and listen to the call of the Holy Spirit reminding you of the power of grace and forgiveness? What part of yourself might you reclaim by making space in your heart for love, grace, and generosity instead of anger, envy, and hurt?\n\nDon’t wait to put down your glass. It’s only you that you are hurting!\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\n[i]\n\nInstagram, “How much water is in this glass?,” @thequotecircles, (UK).\n\nForthe week of Aug 7th, 2023\n\nToday I was listening to a favorite podcast. In the most recent episode, one of the storytellers told of doing magic tricks for his nephew at a family gathering. After several tricks and lots of questions from his nephew, the man decided to show his nephew how the “magic” was done. He ended the encounter by telling his nephew that it’s just a trick… there is no magic.\n\nLater, reflecting on his own life journey and an experience he had as a teenager while exploring his native culture and religion, wished he had a chance to go back and tell his nephew something different. To get the story, you’ll have to listen to the podcast, but suffice it to say that the experience included faith and trust as well as an unexplainable outcome. It had been a life changing experience for the storyteller, but as a professor it was also an experience that he couldn’t explain amidst his current belief in science and reason.\n\nThe storyteller, in revealing the secrets of his magic “tricks,” had contributed to diminishing his nephew’s sense of awe as well as his trust in the possibility of the unbelievable, the unexplainable, and the unseen. We all live in a world where we are encouraged to discount what cannot be proven or explained. And yet, our faith tells us that we must not discount those things. At the heart of our faith is a God who cannot be proven … a God who is famous for showing up in unbelievable and unexplainable ways … a God who cannot be seen (at least not in a single expression or physical presence) … a God who typically shows up in unexpected places and people and circumstances. It is, to a large extent, the mystery of God … the unknowable-ness, and the unexplainable-ness … that makes God God.\n\n“Now faith is the assuranceof things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen…By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.” (Hebrews 11:1,3 NRSVUE)\n\nMagic as we know it, the use of illusions to create a desired perspective or altered reality, is in fact a trick or series of tricks intended to entertain and draw us in. God, on the other hand, uses neither illusions nor trickery to draw us in. God does not set out to entertain. God only seeks to reconcile the world to God’s self by being God… a task which is full of mystery and awe … and perhaps even a little “magic.” (aka miracles).\n\nAre you one who looks at life with a sense of awe? Do you allow yourself to be made “speechless”… to have your breath taken away by the unexpected mystery of God? Do you leave room in your life and beliefs for a little “magic?” Or, are you one who has no time or patience for the unknown and unexplainable? I, for one, don’t want a God that is explainable or predictable or even completely knowable. With a God like that, what need would there be for God? We could do it all on our own. Sure, some think that’s possible, but I think not.\n\nThe podcast’s storyteller ends by saying that he wishes he could have a do over with his nephew. He wishes he could tell him…\n\n“A lot of decisions you’re going to have to make in life… the safe route is the best route to go. But there are going to be those moments when you’ve got to take that leap of faith, because there is “magic.” And, when the time is right it will find you.”[i]\n\nWe will all have a lot of decisions to make in life. As the Body of Christ, the safe route is to take a step out in faith … to follow God’s lead. Because there is “magic,” and when the time is right, it will find you.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\n[i] Chenjerai\n\nKumanyika, “Occasional Magic,” The Moth Radio Hour podcast. August 9, 2023. https://themoth.org/radio-hour/occasional-magic\n\nFor the week of July 31st, 2023\n\nThere are lots of reasons why we do the things we do. We do things because they bring us joy (or they bring joy to someone we love), because they offer a sense of adventure, because someone asked us or encouraged us or pressured us to, because it felt “right,” or because there was nothing better to do. I wonder though how often, when asked the question “Why did you do that?,” our answer is “When God tells you to do something, don’t hesitate!”\n\nYesterday, I took the time to go and see the movie, The Sound of Freedom. While at camps this summer, I had heard several people talk about the importance of the movie, and the need for everyone to see it. There is much to be learned and taken from the movie, and I would agree that it is something people should strongly consider seeing (some things are just made more real when they are not simply a statistic on a page). That said, it was the line, “When God tells you to do something, don’t hesitate!” that resonated with me, and has been in my head ever since.\n\nI wish I could say that I have never hesitated when feeling the promptings of God to do something. If I’m being honest, there are times when I’ve done much more (or much less, depending on your perspective) than hesitate. In some instances, I have flat out ignored the gentle nudgings I have sensed. And in other instances, I have reached into my arsenal of excuses… I’m not good enough. I’m not strong enough. I’m imagining it. Someone else will do it. That’s not my area of giftedness. I already do enough. I’m too busy today… maybe tomorrow. Sound familiar?\n\nI too often like the little comfort zone in which I live. Surely, it has it’s own share of chaos and trials and mishaps, but they are familiar because they are mine. There is too much unknown in other people’s issues. Too many questions to ask. Too many risks to take. What if I become emotionally drawn in by it? What if I connect with someone that is able to dismantle the protective walls that I’ve so carefully constructed?\n\nTo those questions Christ answers,\n\n12 Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. 13 I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.\n\n15 “If you love me, you will keep my commandments. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate,[h] to be with you forever. 17 This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him because he abides with you, and he will be in you. (John 14: 12-17, NRSVUE)\n\nI had heard that The Sound of Freedom was not a “feel-good” movie, and let me just say that it lives up to that reputation. Unfortunately, there is a lot in our world that doesn’t feel good. Often, however, it is to those things that God calls us.\n\nMany will probably avoid seeing the movie, or movies like it, because they cannot stand to see children (or anyone for that matter) being hurt. I understand that. I really do. Just know that God will not leave you alone in those things to which you are called.\n\nWhen God tells you to do something… don’t hesitate!\n\nBlessings, Blake\n\nFor the week of July 24th, 2023\n\nWhen I began in ministry thirty years ago, one of the trending self-help courses was Stephen Covey’s “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.”[i] Habit five was one that really resonated with me. It was, “Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.”[ii] For years, I used that as a sort of mantra, and I did everything in my power to help others see the importance of that habit. I truly believed that not only would I be a better person and minister if I followed that principle in my own life, I also believed that the world would be a better place if everyone incorporated it in their lives. For the record, I still believe that it is important.\n\nHowever, over time, I have found that something more is needed. Perhaps it’s only me, but I have found that there are times when true understanding is not possible. With the exponential increase in access to global information in real time, we have opened conversations to things never before considered. Advancing technologies have opened doors to things that have otherwise been unthinkable/impossible. The ability to talk about things previously forbidden due to cultural “norms” has increased our awareness of the possibilities as well as the struggles surrounding real life topics like sexual orientation, gender identity, gender roles, racial diversity, cultural diversity, welcome and inclusion… just to name a few.\n\nThe inability to fully understand the life experience and context of another is not only a church issue. It is a wider cultural issue. Because we do not and cannot understand, we seem to be giving up. It’s as if there is no longer a reason to even come to the table. Walking a mile in the shoes of another doesn’t work when the shoes just don’t fit. As a result, we have replaced “seeking understanding” with seeking reasons and rationalizations (aka excuses) for why we don’t even try to meet others at the table.\n\nIn an effort to clarify what is important, the writer of the Gospel According to Matthew writes, “…seek first the kingdom of God and God’s righteousness.” (Matt 6:33 NRSV). In the absence of understanding, I have found the best way to accomplish this is to seek first to listen … really listen … to the scriptures, of course, but also to the voices of those who have gone before, and to the voices of those who struggle to be heard now. I believe that God’s righteousness demands that we not simply ignore or devalue what we cannot understand. Much of what God has done and is doing would qualify to be discarded if we did.\n\nUltimately, we are called to create sacred community (the peaceable kingdom of God on earth), and that cannot be done if we do not seek first to listen… a task that also requires us to …\n\n“Put away from [us] all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven [us].” (Ephesians 4:33 NRSV)\n\nI spent the last two weeks at family camps in which I had several opportunities to “seek first to listen.” As far as I know, no minds were changed, but hearts were transformed as we experienced the value of being heard. In those moments of connection and listening, God helped us create space for one another and remember our deeper calling to participate in Christ’s mission.\n\nWhat will you “seek first” this week that will allow you to meet others at God’s table?\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\n[i] Stephen R. Covey, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, (New York: Free Press, 1989)\n\n[ii]\n\nIbid.\n\nFor the week of July 3rd, 2023\n\nHaving grown up in the South, I am well-acquainted with the idea and practice of hospitality. Everyone knows that you should always be ready to welcome a guest unannounced … right? Even if the guest arrives at mealtime, there should always be enough to share, and an extra chair to pull up to the table. Back “in the day,” it was not unusual to drop in on friends for a visit. My friends were always welcome to stay for dinner, and I could count on the same hospitality being offered to me in a similar situation. There was always an open, even if “unspoken,” invitation to anyone.\n\nBut, times have changed (even in the South I imagine). Life is busier. People aren’t able to be quite as spontaneous as they used to be. And, with busier life styles, you’re less likely to catch someone at home if you just drop by unannounced. Needless to say, good old-fashioned hospitality is hard to come by. One might say that any hospitality these days is “radical hospitality.”\n\nTruly radical hospitality, however, is more than welcoming friends who drop in, whether expected or not. Radical hospitality in the scriptures means welcoming the stranger … the outcast, the widow, the orphan, the undesirable, the sinner, the immigrant, the other. It goes against common sense and comfort, and, in today’s world, perhaps even safety. I wonder if, given the violence that has become rampant in our world today, Jesus would raise the bar in deciding to whom hospitality ought to be offered. Probably not.\n\nRecently, my daughter’s hospitality got put to the test in a very unexpected way. She and her husband recently moved into their new home. They were very excited to get everything put in its place and get the house prepared to welcome guests. Although my daughter had received guests at the small townhome she owned prior to getting married, the “accommodations” were quite limited. Their new home came with an actual “guest room,” so there would finally be room to show true hospitality … maybe even radical hospitality …after all of the boxes were emptied.\n\nMuch to their chagrin, however, “guests” showed up, both unannounced and unexpected, and made themselves right at home. The guests were a pair of Robins who very quickly built a nest on top of the porch light by the front door. Not only that, but within 24 hours of the beginning of the project, there were three eggs in the porch light nest as well as eggs in two other hanging plants between the door and the driveway. Like it or not, they were there to stay.\n\nSuffice it to say, my daughter is not a big fan of birds … especially ones that have become gate keepers to the front entrance of their home. The fact that the nest was allowed to stay had nothing to do with radical hospitality. She simply could not bring herself to remove the nest and eggs. However, the minute the baby birds are able to fly… all bets are off. For now, they accommodate their guests by entering and exiting the house via alternative paths and allowing them the space that they need.\n\nAs Christians, we are called to offer radical hospitality, and though it doesn’t mean we have to become bird lovers, it does mean that we may have to accommodate others in ways that are a little uncomfortable to us … ways that cause us to adjust our routine. After all, it’s usually only for a short time. And though, in the moment, the costs (emotionally and/or financially) seem unbearable, the resulting joy is priceless.\n\nMaybe you’re not one to share your home with others… especially strangers … but you can find ways to share radical hospitality with others in ways that could change a life. Who knows, it might even change yours.\n\nBlessings,\n\nBlake\n\nFor the week of June 26th, 2023\n\nBack when I was in middle school and high school, I was a very active member of the Boy Scouts of America. And, yes, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. And though I realize that the program has changed significantly and the organization itself has had issues, I have many positive memories from the experiences I had during those years. Besides the goal of becoming an Eagle Scout, it was especially important, for me, to earn what was then called the “God and Country” medal (I think this particular medal has been replaced by others like “God and Life,” “God and Church,” etc.), because it represented two very important parts of my life… being a Christian, and being patriotic … loving God and loving country.\n\nI didn’t think too deeply about the implications of being a Christian and a patriot at the time, I just knew that I loved God and I was a good, law-abiding citizen. I knew, because I had been told time and again, that I had rights, and privileges and freedoms because I was American. To say that I loved my life (my family, my friends, my church, and even my country) would not be a stretch. To say that I took it for granted that everyone had what I had would also not be a stretch. I wouldn’t know until years later just how privileged I was and how insulated I had been from all of the negative things many people experience on a daily basis. Even once I was introduced to persons who were considered as “other” or who experienced life in ways “other” than the way I did, I didn’t see a disconnect between my Christian beliefs and the flag to which I pledged allegiance. Perhaps that is because, there doesn’t have to be a disconnect.\n\nThe Boy Scout Oath includes a promise to “do m"
