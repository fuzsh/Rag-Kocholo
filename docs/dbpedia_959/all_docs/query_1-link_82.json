        "text": "Chris Smither\n\nSunday August 18 6:00pm doors / 7:00pm show\n\nGet Tickets Here - 32.00 - LAWN SEATS\n\nHoning a synthesis of folk and blues for 50 years, Smither is truly an American original. Reviewers and fans from around the world, including Rolling Stone and The New York Times, agree that Chris continues to be a profound songwriter, a blistering guitarist, and intense performer as he draws deeply from the blues, American folk music, modern poets and humanist philosophers. Oh, and he just so happened to pen the Bonnie Raitt classic, “Love Me Like a Man” at the ripe old age of 16!\n\nNEW YORK TIMES: Mr. Smither has taken the blues in a direction entirely his own: stoic existential ruminations sung in a pained, weathered moan and set to quietly virtuosic guitar.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS: Wise words pour forth from Chris Smither – observations and aphorisms, similes and internal rhymes, run-on sentences and concise quips, all in a conversational flow. The careful construction of Smither’s lyrics is a thing of beauty and the bedrock of his bluesy folk music. Smither is an excellent acoustic guitarist and first-rate foot-stomper.\n\nNATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: [Smither] taps his foot to keep the rhythm, much like the late blues legend John Lee Hooker. His finger-picked guitar lines are sleek, unhurried and insistent. And then there’s the voice – equal parts gravel and molasses.\n\nROLLING STONE: Bathed in the flickering glow of passing headlights and neon bar signs, Smither’s roots are as blue as they come. There is plenty of misty Louisiana and Lightnin’ Hopkins in Smither’s weathered singing and unhurried picking. So fine.\n\nwww.chrissmither.com\n\nJim Lauderdale\n\nMonday Sept 2 (Labor Day) 6:00pm doors / 7:00pm show\n\nGet Tickets Here -37.00\n\nAt any given time, you’re likely to find Jim Lauderdale making music, whether he’s laying down a new track in the studio or working through a spontaneous melody at his home in Nashville. And if he’s not actively crafting new music, he’s certainly thinking about it. “It's a constant challenge to try to keep making better and better records, write better and better songs. I still always feel like I'm a developing artist,” he says. This may be a surprising sentiment from a man who’s won two Grammys, released 34 full-length albums, and taken home the Americana Music Association’s coveted Wagonmaster Award. But forthcoming album Game Changer is convincing evidence that the North Carolina native is only continuing to hone his craft.\n\nOperating under his own label, Sky Crunch Records, for the first time since 2016, Lauderdale recorded Game Changer at the renowned Blackbird Studios in Nashville, co-producing the release with Jay Weaver and pulling from songs he’d written over the last several years. “There's a mixture on this record of uplifting songs and, at the same time, songs of heartbreak and despair—because that's part of life as well,” he says. “In the country song world especially, that's always been part of it. That’s real life.”\n\nLauderdale would know: He’s been a vital part of the country music ecosystem since 1991, when he released his debut album and began penning songs for an impressively long roster of country music greats. “When I was a teenager wanting to be a bluegrass banjo player, I never would have imagined that I would get to work with people like Ralph Stanley, Robert Hunter, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Emmylou Harris, Elvis Costello, Lucinda Williams and John Oates ,” he muses. “Getting to work with them inspires me greatly to this day, and I know it always will.” ,” he muses. “Getting to work with them inspires me greatly to this day, and I know it always will.”\n\nJim Kweskin w/ Samoa Wilson\n\nSunday Oct 6 - 6:00pm doors / 7:00pm show\n\nGet Tickets Here - $32.00\n\nJim Kweskin is the founder of the legendary 1960s Jim Kweskin Jug Band with Fritz Richmond, Geoff Muldaur, Maria Muldaur, Mel Lyman and Bruno Wolfe. During the five years they were together, they successfully transformed the sounds of pre-World War II rural music into a springboard for their good-humored performances. Their imitators were legion, including a San Francisco jug band that became the Grateful Dead, a Los Angeles jug band that became the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and a New York jug band that became the Lovin' Spoonful. No other group attained their unique blend of youthful energy and antiquarian expertise, tight musicianship, loose camaraderie, and infectious swing.\n\nThese days Jim is best known as a singer and bandleader, but he also created one of the bedrock guitar styles of the folk revival, adapting the ragtime-blues fingerpicking of artists like Mississippi John Hurt and Pink Anderson to the more complex chords of pop and jazz. He has maintained a remarkably consistent musical vision since his jug band days, continuing to explore traditional folk and blues with the sophisticated sensibility of a jazz musician, and jazz with the communal simplicity of a folk artist. He has recorded many solo ventures, as a member of the U and I band, with band-mate Geoff Muldaur, with Samoa Wilson, with The Texas Sheiks as well as performing and recording with a wide variety of well-known musicians such as Maria Muldaur, John Sebastian, David Grisman, Cindy Cashdollar, Happy Traum, Meredith Axelrod, Juli Crockett and Samoa Wilson, to name a few.\n\nJim Kweskin's shows radiate charm, humor, sophistication and talent. Jim sings a collection of familiar songs by Benny Goodman, Johnny Mercer, the Sons of the Pioneers, Fats Waller, and Somethin' Smith & the Redheads. There's an endearing sense of good humor to Kweskin's interpretations that makes his performances a delight. Because of his vast repertoire and love of the music, Kweskin is recognized as one of the best interpreters of the great American songbook.\n\nRhett Miller (From Old 97s)\n\nSunday Oct 13 - 4:00pm doors / 5:00pm show\n\nGet Tickets Here - $42.00\n\nTexas native Rhett Miller is perhaps best known as the frontman of the Dallas-based alt-country band the Old 97’s, although he has also pursued a critically acclaimed solo career. Formed in 1993, the Old 97’s built a devoted following with their brash blend of country and power pop influences. Old 97s front man, Rhett Miller, doesn't fit into a mold, nor does his music. A native of Austin, Texas, he got his start with the Old 97's in Dallas, and they've since released 12 studio albums. Powered by Miller's distinct voice combined with clever yet vulnerable lyrics, they were pegged alt-country in the '90s and stood at the forefront of that movement, touring incessantly and gaining popularity with songs like \"Barrier Reef\" and the fan favorite \"Timebomb.\"\n\nRegarding his dual career as a band member and solo artist, he said, \"I get to have the best of both worlds, I get to be in a rock band that plays in front of big crowds every once in a while, and I also get to play as a solo artist where the crowd can be hundreds of people but it still becomes this intimate moment where you can tell a story and sing a song.\"\n\nHere’s Rhett live at World Cafe on YouTube\n\nBilly Wylder\n\nSunday June 16 6:00pm doors / 7:00pm show\n\nFrom the front-lines at Standing Rock to the archaic streets of Jerusalem, the Sahel Desert to Carnegie Hall, music has been the source of strength for Billy Wylder. The band features Avi Salloway (Bombino/Hey Mama) joined by an inspired cast of singular artists who have performed across five continents including concerts at Coachella, Newport Folk Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Montreal Jazz Fest, Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center.\n\nBilly Wylder released their seminal third album, Trying to Get Free (Sand & Gold Records), on August 25, 2023. The music weaves together American folk and rock with sensibilities from the Sahara Desert, exploring new musical space akin to Devendra Banhart, Beck, and Tinariwen. Billy Wylder’s new recordings evoke musical evolutions built on grooves informed by ancient African rhythms, art-rock textures, expansive guitars, violins, synths, and drum machines. Salloway’s lyrics flow with inspiration from mythical songwriting hero Leonard Cohen, while threading together more abstract imagery reminiscent of Thom Yorke.\n\nOn the new record, Billy Wylder grapples with some of the most critical questions of our time. What is freedom? Has the American dream died? What is truth and what is truly important to us? The band knows that it takes courage to follow your dreams, to create your own sense of purpose and meaning while living in a society where the media and politics relentlessly project fear, hatred, division, and consumerism. Billy Wylder’s live shows are known for bringing together diverse audiences and building community through uplifting performances, movement, and a sense of universal goodwill. The global band includes musicians from Vermont, Cuba, Peru, and Chicago.\n\nBilly Wylder has toured extensively, performing and collaborating with renowned artists including Jack Johnson, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Bombino, The Low Anthem, and Pete Seeger.\n\n“A sense of mystery and majesty.” –No Depression\n\n“Songs that sound impossibly up-to-minute while remaining steeped in tradition.” –PopMatters\n\nTouring band:\n\nAvi Salloway (vocals, guitar), Rob Flax (violin, synth, vocals), Jennifer Giammanco (bass, vocals), Ricardo Guerra (drums, vocals)\n\nLinks:Website:\n\nbillywlder.com\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/billywylder\n\nMusic Video: https://youtu.be/drdkdWgfQU0\n\nLive Video: https://youtu.be/CIKfPPbp1cQ + https://youtu.be/R2it0GL82rw\n\nListen here: https://linktr.ee/billywyldermusic\n\nJon Stetson - America’s Master Mentalist\n\nJune 23, 2024 - 6:00pm doors / 7:00pm show\n\nButcher Baglio and Estes\n\nSunday July 7 - 6:00pm Doors / 7:00pm show\n\nThree legendary Boston rockers return to The Barn for the third time this summer forr an entrancing night of acoustic music.. Sal Baglio’s Stompers, The Estes Boys and Jon Butcher Axis have been an important part of the Boston music scene for many years.\n\nLead singer for the seminal 80’s rock and roll band The Stompers, Sal Baglio has continued to hone his craft, writing original songs for the past fifteen years. His one-man carnival ride includes his new album Music For Abandoned Amusement Parks. Part music, part storytelling, Sal’s show is pure musical memory theatre. Anyone who ever ran to a music store, rushed home to their turntables, read ALL of the liner notes of their favorite bands will be transported by Mr. Baglio’s stories, original songs, AND cover songs featured in his performance.\n\nWith a Grammy nomination, 19 national and international releases to date, hit videos in steady rotation on MTV and VH1, arena tours supporting the likes of The J. Geils Band, Rush, Def Leppard, Scorpions and INXS, film scores and music licensing for hit cable and TV shows such as Shameless (Showtime), The Simpsons (FOX), The Sopranos and Six Feet Under (HBO), and guest appearances on the EXPERIENCE HENDRIX TOUR, Jon Butcher continues to write and perform to this day, further cementing his reputation as one of the most creative and accomplished musicians to ever come out of Boston. www.jonbutcher.com\n\nAllen Estes has co-written songs with: Tammy Wynette, Shania Twain, David Mallet and many more, and has opened for Bonnie Raitt, Tim McGraw, Reba MacIntire, Robert Palmer to name just a few. He is also writing and recording new music. This will be a great night of original songs re-imagined, as well as songs from the great American Music catalog.\n\nHere’s BBE at the Shalin Liu in Rockport YouTube\n\nFreebo and Alice Howe Band\n\nSunday August 11th- 6:00pm doors / 7:00pm show\n\nAlice Howe and Freebo present a unique study in contrasts, bringing together a rising voice in Americana music and a venerable rock, folk, and blues icon. Each a compelling performer in their own right, they both lead and support each other in their well-crafted songs with flawless harmonies and tasteful instrumentation. They have worked as creative collaborators in the studio and on stage since 2017. Freebo weaves his unique fretless bass stylings into Alice’s superb vocals for a presentation with undeniable chemistry.\n\nTo hear Alice Howe sing is to be enraptured by the natural, unaffected beauty of her voice. There’s no artifice, no histrionics — just honest, authentic, emotionally resonant singing in the tradition of the roots music that shaped her. On Circumstance, her second and latest album, the Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter guitarist displays her vocal prowess and introspective writing in abundance, mining both her heart and her musical tastes for a deep, personal journey across an Americana soundscape dotted with blues, folk, country, soul and rock. Recorded in two sessions at the legendary Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where Etta James and Wilson Pickett once shook the walls, the record channels their spirits with 11 stirring tracks that pull no punches diving into the vagaries of the heart and her own personal journey. As an old soul inside a 30-something millennial, Alice puts her stamp on Americana’s venerable strands with 10 standout originals evoking both the classic singer-songwriters and the seminal music that once filled airwaves, roadhouses and juke joints.\n\nFreebo is best known for his decade of touring and recording with Bonnie Raitt, and has distinguished himself as one of the great bassists of our time, playing on records with CSN, Maria Muldaur, John Mayall, Ringo Starr, Dr. John, and Neil Young as well as appearing on Saturday Night Live, The Midnight Special, The Muppet Show, and in concert with the legendary Spinal Tap. Not willing to simply rest on those achievements, Freebo delved more deeply into his creativity and has become a highly regarded singer/songwriter, now working on his 6th full-length solo CD. A multi award winner and finalist in numerous songwriting contests, Freebo’s music reflects his compassionate concern for the world and people around him, and his lyrics and open stage banter have helped him connect with listeners worldwide. A live musical experience with Freebo is astute, insightful, clever, and truly melodic.\n\nhttps://www.alicehowe.com\n\nhttps://www.freebomusic.com\n\nAmy Fairchild and Thomas Juliano House Concert\n\nSaturday February 24, 2024\n\nDoors 6:00pm\n\nMusic 7:00pm\n\nTicket includes a complimentary bowl of our own house-made Gumbo.

It most certainly is American roots music and it is music born of the black and mixed race French speaking Creoles of South Louisiana. It’s exhilarating and as complex and diverse as the Creoles. It’s also more than just one rhythm and one tempo. Sure it’s about dancing; “less dancing please”, said no-one ever! But, it’s also about grooving in place and dancing freely. It’s definitely about the vocal performance as well. Terrance’s lead vocals and the stunning three part harmonies of he, Danny and Stan – are proof positive that vocal performances matter – a lot! Zydeco is dynamic and evolving – remaining relevant to allow its artists to express themselves within their genre without constraints.\n\nSimien is as knowledgable about this music genre as anyone alive today, because he’s now been touring and recording professionally, as a band leader almost as long as any zydeco artist in history! Fact not fiction. With one exception -the Queen, Ida Guillory! In fact he’s only one of a handful from a generation with a direct link to the pioneers of contemporary zydeco who with the exception of the Queen, Ida Guillory (born in 1929) have all passed on. When Simien started his band in high school in 1981, he was one of only 3 young zydeco artists performing the music as all the others were 20+ years older than he was. Another little known fact for those not as knowledgeable about the history of zydeco, Simien is one of those young emerging artists who was responsible for the 1990’s renaissance of zydeco music.\n\nWe will have a special menu of all New Orleans food available for purchase before the show.

The two shared a love of music, especially Bruce Springsteen and named their band The Magic Rats, after a character in Springsteen's song \"Jungleland.\"\n\nHe brought his love of American artists such as Woody Guthrie, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Chuck Berry, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Tom Waits, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and more with him to Cork, Ireland, where he spent his junior year of college. To help pass the time he learned how to play the songs on guitar and on November 18, 1985 he made his debut as a busker—a street singer—in Cork City, Ireland.\n\nAfter several false starts he started to gain notice around Portland, Maine and in 1990 released his debut cassette, The Promise. Only a few songs off this album, \"Sweet Summertime\", \"Lonesome Highway\" and \"Wrecking Ball\" still occasionally get played in concert. The original tape has unfortunately been lost, and only copies remain.\n\nThat was followed a year later by Looks Good from the Road, recorded with his rock band, The Moxie Men. By the end of the year they were the darlings of the Portland press and touted as one of the bands \"most likely to succeed.\"\n\nHowever, Cleaves's solo acoustic side took over and in 1991 he moved with his wife, Karen, to Austin, Texas. In 1992, he was a winner of the prestigious New Folk competition at the Kerrville Folk Festival, an award previously given to such artists as Nanci Griffith, Robert Earl Keen, Amy Fairchild and Steve Earle.\n\nBill and I are doing a cooking class together, - Intro to Gumbo 101.

While Fulks' best-known songs are often bitingly funny, he also has a gift for writing incisive, evocative material in the country and pop traditions. As time has passed, he's built on the irreverent old-school twang of 1996's Country Love Songs, moving toward the tougher roots rock sound of 1998's Let's Kill Saturday Night and the eclectic, ambitious pop of 2001's Couples in Trouble. With the spare, acoustic sound and stark storytelling of 2013's Gone Away Backward and 2016's Upland Stories, Fulks received some of the strongest reviews of his career, and the latter album earned him his first Grammy Award nomination.\n\nNew York Times: “Mr. Fulks is more than a songwriter. He's a gifted guitarist, a soulful singer with an expressive honky-tonk tenor, and he's a natural performer. But what really sets him apart is his songwriting.”\n\nJournal of Country Music: “Walking to the beat of a different drum, singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks has carved a path between punk iconoclasm and country traditionalism, the Sundowners and Steve Albini, Bloodshot and Geffen, Chicago and Nashville.”\n\nSPIN: “The most underappreciated singer-songwriter in America.”\n\nChicago Tribune: “Robbie Fulks is hotter than a Gatling gun! A masterly, multifaceted songwriter who can belt out hip-shaking honky tonk, honeydew pop and chilling little ballads with an unrivaled skill and spirit. So good, he's scary.”\n\nSunday August 7, 2022\n\nAztec Two-Step 2.0\n\n$31.00\n\nTICKETS ON \"The Store\" PAGE\n\nAztec Two-Step 2.0\n\nSunday August 21, 2022\n\nKenny White\n\nw/ special guest Amy Fairchild\n\n$31.00\n\nTICKETS ON \"The Store\" PAGE\n\nFinally, one of our most requested artists returns to The Farmstand! Astonished audiences often ask KENNY WHITE after a live performance, “How come I’ve never heard of you?” when in fact, the pianist, singer/songwriter, producer and arranger has been very well known in the NYC recording scene for decades. KENNY WHITE comes to the world of the touring singer-songwriter following a long and successful musical journey. An accomplished pianist, who also performs on guitar, Kenny has now become more known for his clever lyrics. LONG LIST OF PRIORS, his aptly named current album, is the latest collection of original songs: snapshots of the human condition. Audiences often comment that a Kenny White concert moves them to laughter and tears — sometimes within the same song! “If Mark Twain could sing and play piano like a virtuoso, his name would be Kenny White.” –Stu Kuby, The Strand, Hudson Falls, NY. Kenny recently completed an 18-month tour performing his original songs while traveling as the opener for Stephen Stills & Judy Collins, and has toured for many years with Cheryl Wheeler.

Formed in 1993, the Old 97’s built a devoted following with their brash blend of country and power pop influences. Old 97s front man, Rhett Miller, doesn't fit into a mold, nor does his music. A native of Austin, Texas, he got his start with the Old 97's in Dallas, and they've since released 12 studio albums. Powered by Miller's distinct voice combined with clever yet vulnerable lyrics, they were pegged alt-country in the '90s and stood at the forefront of that movement, touring incessantly and gaining popularity with songs like \"Barrier Reef\" and the fan favorite \"Timebomb.\"\n\nRegarding his dual career as a band member and solo artist, he said, \"I get to have the best of both worlds, I get to be in a rock band that plays in front of big crowds every once in a while, and I also get to play as a solo artist where the crowd can be hundreds of people but it still becomes this intimate moment where you can tell a story and sing a song.\"\n\nHere’s Rhett live at World Cafe on YouTube"
