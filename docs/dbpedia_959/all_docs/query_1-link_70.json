        "text": "Columbus, Ohio USA\n\nReturn to Homepage www.shortnorth.com\n\nFritz the Nite Owl Jazz\n\nThis is an Archive\n\nShort North Gazette columnist 1999 - 2009\n\nSo what's he doing now?\n\nThe latest episode of \"Nite Owl Theatre\" and Nite Owl merchandise can be found at FritzLives.com\n\nVisi www.facebook.com/niteowltheatre\n\nVisit www.fritzlives.com\n\nemail niteowltv@yahoo.com\n\nRead a October 31, 2006 profile on Fritz in the Chillicothe Gazette\n\nHere is some YouTube stuff: www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_bMYwNPnoE&feature=channel_video_title\n\nWant to learn more about this guy? http://m.homestead.com/m.html\n\nJazz Review Archive (below) 1999-2009\n\nDecember 2009\n\nHOLIDAY CDS NEW AND OLD COMBINE TO MAKE THE SEASON MERRY AND BRIGHT!\n\nCheery Ghost of Christmas past visits the Nite Owl on 50th On-Air Anniversary\n\nAs the old song states “funny how time slips away...” Not only has another year slipped by, but the Ghost of Christmas Past materialized from the mind-mists of yesteryear to remind me that this year, I wrap up 50 years of broadcasting jazz and writing about it in Central Ohio. Mid-November of 1959, when I started my first on-air gig on WMNI-AM, seems like only yesterday. It was followed by air-work at numerous other stations, radio and TV, along with writing newspaper jazz reviews. I’ve enjoyed almost every minute, never considered it a job, and have always been pleased and grateful for the support of the listeners, viewers, and readers. So my thanks and best wishes to all of you. Couldna’ done it without youse!\n\nHoliday jazz was/still is one of the highlights of the gig. Each year, I look forward with enthusiasm to hear how the many creative jazz artists will bring new dimensions and approaches to my favorite carols.\n\nA few of my all-time highlights over the years (I dig ’em even in July) are “England’s Carol” (aka: “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” ) by the Modern Jazz Quartet, “Merry Christmas Baby” by Etta Jones, “Silent Night” by Kenny Burrell, “I Bought You A Plastic Star For Your Aluminum Tree” by Michael Franks, “Happy Holidays” by Manhattan Transfer, “The Christmas Song” by Nat King Cole, “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” by harpist Corky Hale, “Twas The Night Before Hanukkah,” by Cantor Kenny Ellis, “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?” by Nancy Wilson, and “The Nutcracker Suite” by Les Brown, to name a very few. You can definitely count on hearing these, as you have in the past, along with many others, new and old, on my shows this season, including:\n\nCarla Bley: Carla’s Christmas Carols (WATT/35 Records-BOO13428-02)\n\nBoundless imagination combined with masterful technical prowess, have established Carla Bley as one of the most innovative, exciting, freewheeling, idiosyncratic, unpredictable, theatrical and sometimes-irreverent, solid-jazz pianists on the planet. She earned and sharpened her formidable chops with such innovative players as vibist Gary Burton and bassist Charlie Haden. She’s equally adept as a player, composer, arranger, or leader, fronting a small group or big band. Whatever the style – be it straight-ahead, swing, bop, post-bop, free, or avant-garde – Carla handles it with ease, style, and unlimited creativity.\n\n‘Tis no wonder then that her venture into the realm of familiar holiday music is fresh, new, unusual, unpredictable, interesting, and a captivating listening experience. Her superb arrangements are augmented by the bass of Steve Swallow, and the German Partyka Brass Quintet, whose members provide trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone, French horn, and tuba, along with glockenspiel, chimes, and bass trombone. The overall sound combines the best of jazz, traditional and classical. Heavy swingers are counterbalanced superbly with the more peaceful, introspective approaches.\n\n“The Christmas Song,” “O Tannenbaum,” “Away in a Manger,” and Carla’s original, “Jesus Maria” are treated with elegant reverence, while her expanded excursion into “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,” combines Dickens with the Duke. ‘Tis one of the many highlights in the program. You’ll go a long time before you hear a more playful and fun-filled version of “Jingle Bells,” featuring the festive sounds of the brass quintet, solidly grounded by the oom-pa-pa of the tuba. The program concludes with Steve Swallow’s performance of “O Holy Night” on electric bass, leading into an inspirational, contemplative “Joy to the World.”\n\nAlexis Cole: The Greatest Gift (Motema Records: MTM-26)\n\nVariety, innovation, creativity, warmth, and holiday cheer are the hallmarks of this festive collection by Alexis Cole. She’s a contralto, which is the deepest female singing voice. Characterized by a rich, smooth, velvety elegance, she brings all of those qualities to this holiday treat, which combines eight religious traditionals with three pop standards and two originals.\n\nHer mellow voice is augmented on various tracks with combinations of a solid jazz sextet, strings, and three vocal groups: St. Paul Children’s Choir, the St. James Quartet, and the Broadway Kids Singers.\n\nHighlights, both vocal and instrumental, abound throughout, including a nostalgia-inducing “Christmas Time Is Here,” a gently swinging “Away in a Manger,” and her churchy, bloozy original, “Jesus is the Best Part of Christmas,” which features some great sax by Don Braden, and answers the question, “What Does Christmas Mean To You?”\n\nIn addition to the superb music, sales of the album benefit World Bicycle Relief, which provides access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities to needy countries. The collection has a strong local connection: Producer Todd Barkan and featured violinist Christian Howes, are both originally from, and worked prolifically, in Columbus.\n\nCorky Hale: Harp! The Herald Angels Swing ( Laser Light # 12-536)\n\nIf there is one instrument that is superbly suited to the sounds of the season and to jazz, it is the harp, heard frequently in classical music but infrequently in pop and other secular forms. Harpo Marx, Dorothy Ashby and Deborah Henson-Conant are three of the best-known harpists; they are joined by Corky Hale, who also excels on piano and celeste, which she also adds to this thoroughly enjoyable program.\n\nHer overall sound could best be described as “Olde English swing,” conjuring visions of The First Christmas, combined with the worlds of Tiny Tim, goose and figgy pudding for dinner, Ralphie’s Red Ryder BB gun, and an elegant, modern jazz club on Christmas Eve.\n\nWhile every track is a wintry-winner, I particularly enjoyed her bright, easy-swingin’ harp versions of “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” and “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” which were balanced with reverent-reminiscence by the combination of celeste and piano on “Auld Lang Syne/New Years Eve.”\n\nNovember 2009\n\nSINGER SETS ROMANTIC MOOD AND CONJURES JOHNNY RAY\n\nGive the gift of jazz for the holidays\n\nFor the reasonably organized, take-care-of-business-promptly people, this column will be timely, and possibly of interest for those who have jazz aficionados on their holiday gift list and are seeking suggestions. For the procrastinators, it could be a last-minute bailout, finding an enjoyable, timeless gift of jazz.\n\nSo, for both groups, read on.\n\nDue to the many approaches, styles, and sounds in jazz – from simple swingers to the more complex and sometimes unusual, coupled with any given listener’s personal preferences, your purchasing problem can be difficult. However, over the years, in this column and on my radio show, I’ve only written about and aired jazz CDs that I personally enjoy; CDs that may not be the “greatest-ever-recorded,” but nonetheless have a “timeless, undated” quality that will continue to please for years to come. If you’re online, check out the numerous selections I’ve written about since 1999 and still recommend at shortnorth.com. If you’re not online, here are a few recent releases that should please a wide range of listeners.\n\nThe Heart and Soul of Mel Carter (CSP Records-42239-8)\n\nMel Carter, who operates in the upper-baritone register à la Jon Hendricks, presents a program of romantic jazz that explores all the elements of “love found, love savored, love lost.” Backed by a septet throughout, he’s as big and bright or intimate and emotional as dramatized by the lyrics.\n\nThe title track, “Heart and Soul,” is rivaled only by “Chopsticks” as the one song that just about anyone can pound out on the piano. I, as one of those pounders, had forgotten that the song, as originally written by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, is a laid-back, gently swinging celebration of finding that special someone. Carter recaptures the real sentiment and mood.\n\nAt the other end of the emotional spectrum is “Cry,“ a song I hadn’t thought about or heard for years; a huge hit with teens in the early 1950s, a song that gave singer Johnny Ray international fame. People today still remember that parents in those days were shocked and perplexed by Presley; they’ve forgotten that these same parents displayed equal dismay for Johnny Ray, aka musically as “Mr. Emotion.” That bit of pop-music trivia aside, this update by Carter evokes all the heartache and despair experienced in the lyrics “If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye, it’s no secret you’ll feel better if you cry…” A bit corny, granted, but still a melancholy and memorable meander down melody lane. Some great guitar by Grant Geissman and alto sax by Fred Jackson up the jazz ante from the original instrumentation. This was my favorite track on the album.\n\nOther superb selections include modernized versions of Arthur Prysock’s “I Worry About You,” Alice Faye’s 1943 Oscar-winning “You’ll Never Know,” Dinah Washington’s “If It’s the Last Thing I Do,” and Buddy Johnson’s “Baby I’m Yours.” If mellow male jazz singing is the thing, you won’t go wrong with this.\n\nChuck Owen and the Jazz Surge: The Comet’s Tail (Mama Records: MAA-1038)\n\nThis collection presents a cooking-on-all-burners 17-piece jazz orchestra, the Jazz Surge, directed by Chuck Owens, performing new, internationally created arrangements of compositions by the late, legendary saxophonist Michael Brecker, who was equally revered by fans of fusion, mainstream, and post-bop. He was a major player on the jazz scene ever since his work with Horace Silver in the 1960s, leading to a double-Grammy win in the ‘90s. Building on the work of John Coltrane, Brecker’s hard-edged tone and creative approach established him as one of the important influences on modern tenor men.\n\nTo amplify this superb tribute to his musical contributions, the Surge-roster adds such well-known Brecker collaborators as his brother Randy on trumpet and flugelhorn, Joe Lovano and Dave Liebman on saxophones, Mike Stern on guitar, Mike Mainieri on vibes, and Danny Gottlieb on drums, to name a few.\n\nA roaring, uptempo scorcher, “Peep” opens things up and sets the mood for the seven powerhouse performances that follow, all ranging in length from 6 to 12-plus minutes. “Slings and Arrows” sustains the excitement and features some torrid tenor work by Jack Wilson, along with dynamic drumming by Gottlieb. Counterbalancing these and other rousers are such moodier and introspective pieces as “How Long ‘Til the Sun,” highlighted by the flugelhorn playing of brother Randy, and “Everything Happens When You’re Gone,” featuring sensitive sax by Lovano.\n\nWhile not the CD for new jazz listeners, this will surely please those who enjoy the edgier, more-complex approach.\n\nThe Reese Project: Eastern Standard Time (In The Groove Records:CD-1006)\n\nI’ve heard some unusual instrumentations before, but this was a combination that was completely new – a quartet featuring fresh flute and mellow cello out front, played by Tom and Laurie Reese respectively, backed by guitar and drums, amplified by a guest percussionist. The overall sound is bright, airy, refreshing: the selection of songs an imaginative mix of originals and standards.\n\n“Just Friends” is one of those favorites that has been recorded innumerable times by musicians of all inclinations. Familiar as it is, the briskly imaginative take here makes it as modern as tomorrow, and also establishes the unique sound created by the group, which works equally well on their bloozier, more melancholy version of “When Sunny Gets Blue” and their latin-lite take on “Black Orpheus.”\n\nThe bright, happily moving “Heads-Up and Gone” is highlighted with the rarely heard sound of “swingin’ cello,” which contrasts dramatically with the more traditional “cello noir” approach used on “Moment in Blue.”\n\nOctober 2009\n\nOLD PROS NEVER DIE, THEY JUST PLAY AWAY\n\nSax Legend, Bass Baron, Guitar Genius, and Vibrant Vocalist Outstanding in October\n\nIf there was an All-Star Hall of Fame for saxophone players, “Old Pro” James Moody would be a charter member. On the national scene since his days with the Dizzy Gillespie Band in the mid-‘40s, Moody’s great sense of time, warm personal tone, improvisational skills, and ability to absorb and master the new trends and approaches to jazz as they appeared over the years have kept him in the front ranks for well over 60 years. His rendition of “I’m in the Mood for Love” in the early ‘50s was a big hit, which became even bigger after the King Pleasure vocalese version “Moody’s Mood For Love.” Young saxmen and singers still “borrow” quotes from both versions.\n\nThis experience, imagination, and formidable technique are infinitely evident on his latest release:\n\nJames Moody: Moody 4A (IPO Recordings)\n\nThis set was recorded on the first day of a two-day session. Hence the title, Moody 4A. Day two of the session will be released in the foreseeable, logically titled Moody 4B.\n\nBacked by his long-time bass player, Todd Coolman, along with special guests Kenny Barron on piano and Lewis Nash on drums, the Moody 4 quartet brings new life and verve to a group of jazz classics and familiar standards. The opener, “Secret Love,” gets a “Blues March” approach in which Moody’s rapid-fire improvisations include snippets from Grofe’s “On The Trail” and Gillespie’s “BeBop.”\n\nKenny Barron’s brisk “Voyage” is counterbalanced perfectly by a dreamy, romantic rendition of “Round Midnight.” Other innovations include a piano-sax duet on “East of the Sun,” a gently exotic, erotic, bossa-based tryst with “Stella By Starlight” and a straight-ahead romp with Benny Golson’s “Stablemates.” Things wrap up in waltz time with an easy-swingin’ “Bye Bye Blackbird.”\n\nFor the multitudes of Moody minions of all ages, Moody 4A is dynamic proof that this Old Pro still has the creative chops, creativity and mastery of his instrument to rival (or outplay) anyone on the bandstand today.\n\nBrian Bromberg: It Is What It Is (Artistry Music: ART-7019)\n\nLike most non-musicians, I assumed there were only two types of bass: acoustic and electric. Never did I dream there were so many versions-variations of the instrument until I heard this CD. On this set, Brian Bromberg, one of the most talented and renowned bass players on the planet, unleashes and uses his full arsenal.\n\nThe listener will hear the tenor bass, 5-string bass, 4-string bass, hollow body piccolo bass, solid body piccolo bass, upright bass, fretless bass, steel string acoustic piccolo bass, BSX5 string electric upright bass, nylon string acoustic piccolo bass, and steel string solid body piccolo bass with overdrive guitar sound. Whew!! Not only does Bromberg use all of these instruments, he frequently uses three or more per track. Bassists will love, learn, and borrow from this CD for years.\n\nIn addition to his bastion of basses, he’s backed on various tracks by groups ranging from quintets to a 13-piece big band, boasting such well-known heavyweight guests as Gerald Albright, Rick Braun, Randy Brecker, George Duke, Jeff Lorber, Eric Marienthal, Dave Weckl, and Patrice Rushen, to name a few.\n\nWhile I thought that there were some outstanding guitar solos on the CD, the liner notes informed me that “There are no guitar melodies or guitar solos on this recording. All melodies and solos that sound like guitar are played by Brian on piccolo basses, which are basses with strings that are tuned to the register of a guitar.”\n\nGranted, while all of this sounds to be “tech-talk,” the CD cooks from open to close. A funky big band opens things up with a rousing version of the title track, followed by, three tracks later, a mellow, introspective 6-piece group with strings. Add a short tenor bass solo, a 12-piece outing on the TV theme from “Sanford and Son” a few easy strollers, and some laid-back loungers leading to the closer, a 10-piece band havin’ funky fun on “Slap Happy.”\n\nJoe Beck and Laura Theodore: Golden Earrings (Whaling City Sound: WCS- 049)\n\nIn all the years I’ve been writing this column, I’ve never re-reviewed a CD I had written about before.\n\nBut, there’s a first time for everything. So, once again, I’ll mention this outstanding jazz-guitar-vocal-collaboration of Joe Beck and Laura Theodore, which I covered in the February 2008 issue of the Gazette. Check out shortnorth.com for specific details.\n\nThis superb CD was initially released on a small, not overly well-distributed label. Thus, not many people were able to find it, buy it, appreciate it. Fortunately, it is now available on a major, easily accessible label.\n\nThis was the last recording for late guitar genius Joe Beck, whose playing is, as usual, outstanding – amplified admirably by the creative jazz vocal interpretations of the four-octave-ranged Laura Theodore. If you appreciate great guitar and sensational singing, you’ll enjoy this CD, which is a homage to the collaborations of Peggy Lee and her guitarist husband, Dave Barbour.\n\nThe title track is from a 1947 movie starring Oscar-winner Ray Milland and the iconic Marlene Dietrich. The movie, not a musical, involved gypsy espionage in World War II. Murvyn Vye sang the title song, which became a super hit internationally when covered on record by Peggy Lee shortly thereafter.\n\nAs a bit of trivia for the movie mavens in the crowd, Milland won the Best Actor Oscar in 1945 for his powerful performance in the Billy Wilder film “The Lost Weekend,” which also won for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.\n\nSeptember 2009\n\nGUITAR, BASS, AND BIG BAND CDS STAND OUT IN SEPTEMBER!\n\nDiversity dominates and defines the many sounds of jazz\n\nIn columns past, I’ve bemoaned the fact that one particular instrument or sound usually dominates the many monthly promotional CDs I receive for use on my radio show and this column. For whatever reason, be it intelligent design or cosmic coincidence, far too often I get too much of the same thing at the same time. One month it’s nothing but piano trios, another month female vocalists, trumpeters, saxmen, organists, Latin, whatever. Makes putting together a radio show or jazz review column a challenge of creative complexity – how not to broadcast or write about music that’s all of one type. Granted, it’s easier than lifting cement blocks off a truck in 99-degree heat, but it is a challenge.\n\nFortunately there are exceptions to everything and the releases I review this time around represent a marvelously varied collection of musical sounds, group sizes, approach, and complexity. So, assuming you enjoy a reasonably wide range of jazz styles, chances are one or more of these will stimulate your jazz sensibilities.\n\nGrant Geissman Cool Man Cool (Futurism Records: FR-2054)\n\nWhile you may not recognize the Geissman name as fast as you would that of Wes Montgomery, Barney Kessell, George Benson, and others, you will recognize much of his work. He is the co-writer with Dennis C. Brown for the underscores on the hit CBS series Two and a Half Men for which he co-wrote the show theme, which earned him a Grammy Nomination.\n\nYou’ve also heard his guitar playing and writing on such popular shows as Monk, Mad Men, and Dawson’s Creek to name a very few. A quick Internet search on his name will tell you more about this phenomenal guitarist than you probably want to know. In addition, many sites provide more than an ample sample of his dynamic musicianship.\n\nOn this, his 15th CD, he utilizes all of his talents: writing, playing, arranging, and producing. The result is a highly diverse presentation of jazz styles and sounds: scorching bebop, Latin, ballads, shuffle blues, and organ-fueled funk, to name a few. In addition, in the course of 14 tracks, he utilizes, depending on the needs of the songs, groups that range in size from his basic quintet up to guest-laden nonets.\n\nAdded to the wide range of sounds, he includes guest stars galore. Among the legendary players who appear hither and yon, are such familiar jazz heavyweights as Chick Corea, Chuck Mangione, Tom Scott, Patrice Rushen, Russell Ferrante and others. Superb liner notes and individual track personnel credits allow you to see how many players are involved and who they are.\n\nGeissman states the concept and title track of the production quite succinctly: “Cool Music I like to play; Cool People I like to play with.” This cool minor blues opener is followed by the greasy, gospel-funk-fortified “Chicken Shack Jack,” featuring the big-toned, soulful sax of Scott (Tom, who appears again later).\n\n“Chuck and Chick” is a Latin-flavored waltz showcasing the talents of guests Chuck Mangione, Chick Corea, and Russell Ferrante, pianist and founder of The Yellowjackets, who gets more solo space on the next track, “Even If...”\n\nUnpredictability, surprise, and variety follow, with excursions into the ‘30s with tuba, gypsy violins, and accordian; exotic jungle Polynesian-Hawaiian, Nyaw-leans, calypso, bop, and shuffle-swing are also well-presented in this outstandingly diverse collection.\n\nChristian McBride and Inside Straight Kind of Brown ( Mack Avenue: Mac-1047)\n\nMcBride is an All-Star, Hall of Fame, heavyweight bass player who has impressed modern andiences for over two decades. He currently serves as the co-director of the New York City Jazz Museum of Harlem. He has played Columbus a number of times to both critic and audience raves, and has led or appeared on countless CDs produced by the most prestigious players ever.\n\nFor this outing, he put together an unusual quintet comprised of bass, drums, piano, sax, and vibes, which he leads dynamically through an imaginative, well-balanced blend of 10 tunes, including seven of his originals.\n\nThe group name, Inside Straight, refers to both a difficult-to-get, usually winnable poker hand, and a homage to the title of the last CD produced by the legendary Cannonball Adderly.\n\n“Brother Mister” is a medium tempo, funky opener and sets the mood for the music to follow. He explores the lyrical on “Starbeam,” visits the blues on “Used ‘Ta Could,” waltzes the group through “Uncle James,” and soars his way, all stops out, for the ultra-uptempo flagwaver “Stick And Move.”\n\nMark Buselli An Old Soul (Owl Studios: OWL-00130)\n\nWhile the powerhouse 16-piece Buselli-Wallarab Jazz Orchestra is featured on this CD, the production this time around is primarily the work of arranger, conducter, trumpeter, flugelhornist Mark Buselli. Co-leader and trombonist Brent Wallarab appears on only one track and left most of the work to his compadre, Buselli.\n\nFor this set, Buselli, director of jazz studies at Ball State amplifies his big band with a 13-piece string section and vocalist Kelleen Strutz, who lends her powerful or subtle voice to five of the 11 selections.\n\nThings open up with a rousing rendition of the standard “My Shining Hour,” followed by an easy-walkin’ Buselli original, “135 B. Chiswick,” showcasing Mark’s fluglehorn and terrific work by bassman Jack Helsley.\n\nA moody-but-melodic “Chelsea Bridge” is counterbalanced perfectly by the hard-swinging “Artificial Bebop,” which conjures Woody’s “Four Brothers” and later works by Supersax. Of particular interest and appeal is the Charles Mingus classic “Fables of Faubus,” usually performed in an almost dirge-like tempo, but here as an uptempo, colorful, and humorous romp.\n\nAugust 2009\n\nSEPTUAGENARIAN SINGERS-SWINGERS EXUDE ENERGY AND EXPERIENCE\n\nDavid “Fathead” Newman, Johnnie Bassett, Elli Fordyce, all in their 70s, still young in sound and style\n\nIt was the late, great Bette Davis who once summed up the challenges of aging, when she proclaimed“Getting’ old ain’t for sissies!” She was referring to the multitudes of seniors, who, despite numerous health and other problems still remain active in volunteer, charity and church work, golf, tennis, swimming pools, dance clubs, travel tours and more.\n\nIn the entertainment world, one earful of singers Johnnie Basset and Elli Fordyce and sax-legend David “Fathead” Newman – all in their 70s – prove her point. Sissies they ain’t – hall-of-fame, industrial-strength, hard-core jazz swingers they are – as exemplified by their current CD presentations. A new listener, not familiar with their bios, would assume, based on their power, prowess, energy, and musicianship, that these were well-established young pros, probably in their mid-30s. Their advantage is that they offer the energy of the young, augmented by the musical techniques- experience-wisdom gained by years of performing.\n\nJohnnie Bassett: The Gentleman is Back (Mack Avenue: SLY-3003)\n\nJohnnie Bassett has been on the blues-jazz scene for over 50 of his 73 years. His hard drivin’, soulful singing and guitar style combines the energy of jump blues, Delta roots, and citified jazz/blues. Over the years, he’s backed up or performed with such legends as Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix, John Lee Hooker, Smokey Robinson and many others.\n\nThis current CD, his first since 1997 for a variety of reasons, is a prime example of his musical approach. As he explains, “I like jump-type stuff because it gives you energy. The people need upbeat music to help take them to a better place. I know I do, that’s why I play upbeat blues.”\n\nHe couldn’t have described the overall effect of this presentation better.\n\nHis basic trio of B-3, bass, and drums is augmented on nine of the 11 tracks by the jazz power of The Motor City Horns (two trumpets, sax, and trombone) and other special guests. The program is an invigorating blend of grooves. “Keep Your Hands Off My Baby” has that good-time party feeling; “A Woman’s Got Ways” and “I’m Lost” are moody and soulful; the streetwise wisdom of “Nice Guys Finish Last” is sage advice for bachelors lookin’ for romance (“…I know a woman’s needs come first – and nice guys finish last.”)\n\nGranted, Ray Charles owns “Georgia On My Mind,” but Johnnie’s version is one of the best runner-ups.\n\nMy personal favorite, which I dedicate to all the voluptuaries, size 8 and over, is the sly, humorous-but-accurate “Meat On Them Bones.” Those who appreciate the art of Rubens, Cabanel, Titian, and Reni will know whereof he sings.\n\nAs most musicians know, “You can’t lose when you play the blues!” Listeners will discover “They can’t lose when they add this energizing, timeless CD to their collections.\n\n”David “Fathead” Newman: The Blessing (High Note: HCD-7195)\n\nOriginally an alto sax player, David “Fathead” Newman began his professional career with local groups while still in high school. Due to the many R&B gigs at that time, he added tenor and baritone sax to his arsenal. However, in 1952, after two years in college, studying theology and music, he left to work with T-Bone Walker. In 1954, he joined the Ray Charles Band on Bari, but soon, due to his strong beat, big warm tone, personal and funky stylings, became the star tenor player. So much so that in 1959, Atlantic Records produced his first album, Fathead: Ray Charles Presents ‘Fathead,’ followed by many other albums for Atlantic.\n\nTwelve years with Charles led to 10 years with Herbie Mann and other performances with such diverse artists as Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Dr. John and others. In 1980, he went completely on his own as a leader and recorded numerous award-winning and popular albums.\n\nThe Blessing, sadly, was his last. He recorded it in December 2008, and went to that “ Great Jam Session In The Sky” in January 2009. Hearing the CD, however, one would not have suspected his health had gone bad. The strength, energy, musicianship, imagination is evident on every track.\n\nBacked by vibes, piano, guitar, bass, and drums, he opens with a walkin’ bluesy Milt Jackson tune, “SKJ,” followed by two sensual, sub-toned romantic ballads, “Someone To Watch Over Me,” and one of the best\n\ninstrumental versions of “As Time Goes By.” Steve Nelson on vibes is outstanding on both. A bit of bossa, bop, noir, introspection, and inspirational Newman-flute round out the diverse and enthralling program.\n\nElli Fordyce Sings Songs Spun of Gold (Fordyce Music: FM-002)\n\nElli Fordyce doesn’t rush into things. A veteran and respected jazz singer in cabarets, live theatre, film, and TV, (with career-interruptions here and there, ie: an auto-truck accident, recovery, family concerns, etc.), she finally got around to recording her first CD last year, at age 72. Its incredible popularity led to this CD in which she combines all of her formidable talents to bring fresh warmth, swing, style, and artistic jazz sensitivity to 17 “songs spun of gold.”\n\nThe introspective longing she evokes on “Wee Small Hours” is as evocative, intimate and lonely as an Edward Hopper painting, counterbalanced perfectly by the optimism, verve, and swing of “Pick Yourself Up.” Her captivating voice, jazz sensibilities and interpretations, wide variety of tunes, and superb support from her musicians make Fordyce a formidable force in the front rank of jazz vocalists today.

This concept presents the original single CD versions of these recordings – but now expanded, amplified, and augmented with previously unreleased tracks from the original recording sessions, longer versions of the original selections, verbal interplay between the musicians and producers, false starts on some, material that provided the initial concept for the originals, and much more. The result is a longer, more-complete two-disc set sure to please aficionados of the original vinyl releases as well as those who are experiencing these classic performances for the first time.\n\nAt this point however, an admonition, advice, warning to those interested in buying these releases. Be sure to see the words “LEGACY EDITION” printed on the front cover art, which is otherwise completely identical to the original single vinyl/CD release. Your pal, da Owl, don’t want you to end up with another single CD copy of an album you already have.\n\nThe series started a few months ago with the presentation of Kind of Blue by Miles Davis (reviewed in our April Edition). It continues superbly with “Legacy Editions” for three of Columbia’s most popular, innovative, timeless recordings ever – by Dave Brubeck, Charles Mingus and, coming-back-for-seconds, Miles Davis.\n\nDave Brubeck: Time Out: Legacy Edition (Columbia-Legacy-88697-53434-2)\n\nAmong its many innovations, Time Out was an exploration of unusual time signature experiments. While up to this point (1959) most jazz time was played 4-beats-to-the-measure, Brubeck presented music in such hitherto rarely used time signatures as 5/4 in the classic track “Take Five” (by the way, not written by Brubeck but by his Altoman, Paul Desmond), 9/8 in “Blue Rondo à la Turk,” and many other beats for other selections.\n\nTime Out was the first jazz album to sell over one-million copies, and best represents the classic Brubeck sound and approach: clean, spare playing with the light, airy, icy-blue Desmond alto over Brubeck’s elegant, modern chords.\n\nThe expanded Legacy Edition contains the basic Brubeckians – altoman Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright, and drummer Joe Morello in almost an hour’s worth of previously unreleased material from recordings at various Newport Jazz Festivals. To my ears, the expanded, looser versions of “Take Five” and “Blue Rondo” heard here far surpass the originals on Time Out. Why Columbia never released these sessions before is a mystery to me. They are sensational and present Brubeck at his best!\n\nWhile advanced, sophisticated, and unusual for its time in the late ‘50s, this CD (unlike the others listed below) is an excellent introduction to newbie-listeners unfamiliar with the wide range and appeal of modern jazz. As an added bonus, the retail/commercial copies of the Legacy Edition include a DVD of the performances, not included with my radio sample. However, since it’s Brubeck, Desmond et al, I can only assume it’s great – making for a superb audio-video presentation, and definitely a collectors’ item.\n\nCharles Mingus: Mingus Ah Um: Legacy Edition (Columbia-Legacy-88597-53436-2)\n\nThis was the first Mingus CD I purchased after being introduced to him by Jean Shepherd (narrator, writer, performer in the magnificent movie “A Christmas Story”) on the Mingus CD The Clown (Atlantic-1260, vintage 1958 – whatever). It is considered by most Mingus aficionados as one of his five most representative and singular recordings.\n\nMingus, an outstanding bassist, composer, and bandleader, wrote music too individualistic for categorization. However, it is instantly recognizable upon hearing. It combines all of the stormy, emotional, dissonant, churchy, atonal, dissonant, past-present-and-future sounds of jazz. It is a combination of Duke Ellington and free jazz, unique in voicing, turbulence, intensity and changeability.\n\nAmong the many innovative sounds one will experience in Ah Um is the double-time drumming of Dannie Richmond in the churchy-shouting “Better Git It In Your Soul,” the satirical, minstrel show vaudevillity of “Fables of Faubus,” and the blues-ballad homage to sax-legend Lester Young in “Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,” highlighted by an outstanding solo by tenorman Booker Ervin.\n\nThis new Legacy Edition contains three bonus tracks and three alternate takes from the original Ah Um release, along with the complete, related-in-sound-approach-style-and-concept album Mingus Dynasty, which includes a bonus track from that production.\n\nCumulatively, the various groups heard range from seven to nine players, and feature superb work and solos by such well-known all-stars as saxmen John Handy, and Shafi Hadi, vibist Teddy Charles, pianists Horace Parlan and Roland Hanna, trombonist Jimmy Knepper, and others.\n\nMiles Davis: Sketches of Spain: Legacy Edition (Columbia-Legacy-88697-53435-2)\n\nThis was the third collaboration between Miles Davis and arranger-conductor Gil Evans which presents, once again, Miles as the only soloist, augmented by an orchestral setting. Unlike the first two sessions, this one is more classically oriented, and swings less. The compositions are all Spanish/Andulsian flamencos, melancholy melodies filled with longing and loneliness, yet with a blues-jazz undertone that accommodates the unique Davis sound.\n\nThis Legacy Edition contains the original album plus all the outtakes, rehearsal and alternate takes of the music, and in one instance a track, “Teo” featuring the Davis Quintet: John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb – a creation from 1961, that strongly resembles Miles’ future solo approach, phrasing, and melodic content used later on Sketches.\n\nWhile not the album to introduce one to the music of Miles Davis, this Legacy Edition is sure to please the serious collectors who found Sketches of Spain to be one of his most emotionally involving works.\n\nJune 2009\n\nTEENAGE SAX-MISTRESS, VETERAN B-3 BURNER, TOWERING TRUMPETER DOMINATE CURRENT JAZZ CDS!\n\nArtists blend golden age jazz basics with 21st-century innovations\n\nWhatever your preferences in jazz, chances are, one or all of these recent releases will light your fires, immolate your imaginations, burn your backsides with their inspirational innovations on the many, diversified, ever-changing-evolving sounds and approaches to jazz.\n\nThree highly diverse musicians, in age, instrumentation, and style, offer jazz listeners of yesterday, today, and tomorrow a multitude of jazz sounds that are sure to please even the most critical and discriminating ears.\n\nGrace Kelly: Mood Changes (PAZZ: 16-9)\n\nThis is the fifth and finest CD yet produced by Ms. Kelly, the 16-year-old sax-ation who started her professional recording career at age 12 in 2004. Her second CD, at age 13, a two-disc set, Times Two, debuted a year later. Every Road I Walked, presented in 2006, gave her the first of her ASCAP Foundation Awards and an invitation to perform with the Boston Pops. You can read my review of this recording in the May 2007 issue of the Short North Gazette. Her fourth outing GRACEfulLEE found her co-starring, and holding her own, with alto-sax legend Lee Konitz, one of her idols and influences.\n\nOn Mood Changes, she continues to expand her triple-threat talents as a musician, singer, and composer, adding tenor and soprano saxes to her arsenal of instruments, and on two tracks, a deeper, more mature approach to her vocalizing and writing, particularly on her original introspective composition “But Life Goes On.” She wrote four originals for the 10-song album, the others by such as Lennon-McCartney, Bill Withers, Rogers & Hammerstein to name a few.\n\nHer debut on tenor sax is equally mature and impressive. Her composition “Tender Madness” blends romance, sadness, and softness. A bossa-based “It Might As Well Be Spring” not only showcases her ease as a vocalist but also a light, breezy sax-sound that reflects her homage to Stan Getz, another influence in her development.\n\nShe opens the set with an upbeat original “Happy Theme Song” which establishes her abilities as a hardcore, industrial-strength swinger on her primary axe, the alto sax. It also introduces the solid swing of her backing musicians on various tracks: trumpet, piano, bass, guitar, drums, and trombone.\n\nWhile every selection is enjoyable, I particularly liked the jam session, high-speed, party-vibe the group evoked on “I’ll Remember April,” the slow, dancin’-romancin’ groove of “Ain’t No Sunshine,” and the the upbeat 7/4 romp on the CD closer, “I Want To Be Happy.”\n\n“Papa” John DeFrancesco: Big Shot (Savant: SCD-2098)\n\nThere have been a number of famous “family” jazzmen, with internationally iconic names such as Adderly, Marsalis, Montgomery, Harper, and Heath, to name a few. Included on the list is DeFrancesco, headed up by patriarch “Papa” John who headlines this set on a burnin’ B-3, aided and abetted by sons, Joey (probably the B-3 man on the scene today) on acoustic and electric pianos, and John, Jr., who holds his own on guitar with “the ol’ man” and “famous brother.”\n\nAdd a tenor sax, bass, and drums, and you have an organ-led sextet that burns the joint down on a smokin’ set of organ classics and original works. Granted, this ain’t one of the “10 Greatest Jazz Albums of All Time,” but it is timeless – a delight to hear today and equally pleasing for the foreseeable decades.\n\nThings open up with an easy-walkin’ “Red Top,” a classic of the genre written years ago by Gene Ammons. The groove is relaxed, danceable, and funky. Joey on electric piano ups the tempo on his intro to The Doors “Riders on the Storm,” which has Papa and tenor bringing a quiet rumble to the proceedings. The title track is funky and cooks up to its name, with “Nola” equaling it in tempo and fire. “Down Home,” one of four tracks written by guitarist John, is a classic slow blues.\n\nBig Shot by the DeFrancescos is ample proof of the adage, “The family that plays together, stays together.”\n\nSean Jones: The Search Within (Mack Avenue Records: MAC-1044)\n\nAdmittedly, more readers on seeing the name “Sean Jones” will think of the Cleveland Browns’ player recently acquired by the Philadelphia Eagles to replace Brian Dawkins for the upcoming ‘09 season. So be it. The name’s the same – but there’s another Sean Jones, a musician, who’s as formidable on trumpet as his counterpart is on safety.\n\nOn this, his fifth album, Jones balances the inward with the outward, a superb blend of introspection, philosophy, and straight-ahead jazz.\n\nThe title tune is in three sections. It opens the album and sets the mood, reappears midway to elaborate, and closes the set with introspection and reflection.\n\nAlong the way, you’ll enjoy an ultra-up-tempo workout on “Transitions,” an equally exciting quintet version of “Sean Jones Comes Down,” a noir ballad, “The Ambitious Violet,” inspired by poet/philosopher Khalil Gibran, a waltz, with vocal, dealing with unreturned love, “Letter of Resignation,” and a playful, time-changing R&B romp “Sunday Reflections.”\n\nAdding to Jones’ trumpet, the basic group includes tenor and alto saxes, piano, bass and drums, with special guests on harmonica, flute, and percussion, and on one track, a vocalist.\n\nWhile this is not the album I’d use to introduce a novice to the world of jazz, it is a performance that will prove to be enjoyable, intriguing, and worth hearing to those familiar with the form.\n\nMay 2009\n\nBURNIN' B-3 + BIG PHAT BAND = TOTAL JAZZ EXCITEMENT!\n\nRarely heard combination scores on every track!\n\nGranted, this is not the first time the flame and fire of the B-3 has co-starred with the bold energy of a roarin’ big band. Organ masters such as Jimmy Smith, Hank Marr, Bobby Floyd and numerous others have added their talents to the big band sound on many occasions. And, while the combination has been heard before, it hasn’t been heard that often, nor on a regular basis. B-3’s generally stick with a trio or quartet lineup; big bands usually are self-contained units with an occasional guest-vocalist or instrumentalist to add to their sound.\n\nSo, as a fan of both the B-3 and the big band, this latest team-up is a winner in every respect: a CD that will easily pass the test of time and provide great listening for years to come.\n\nDave Siebels with Gordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band (PBGL: 786052-8111-2)\n\nDave Siebels is an outstanding keyboardist, arranger, composer, and Emmy Award winner for his TV musical scores. As a player, he’s worked with such heavyweights as Ray Charles, B.B. King and Joe Williams, to name a few.\n\nGordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band features 18 first-rank jazz artists, including Eric Marienthal, Grant Geissman, Wayne Bergeron, Andy Martin and others, including leader-pianist-saxman Goodwin, who already has 11 Grammy nominations on his musical resumé.\n\nThe set opens big, bold and brash, with rousing interplay between the B-3 and the band. Everyone goes all-out – on every note and run. Superlative solos by guitarist Geissman and tenorman Brian Scanlon, along with tight ensemble work by all, makes this track an intense introduction to the musical excitement to follow.\n\nFunk follows on track two. Streetwise and urban, it’s outstanding in its unison ensemble work, along with down-and-dirty drum and bass, and a honkin’, bar-walkin’ solo by altoman Marienthal.\n\nTrack three proves what every musician knows: “You can’t lose when you play the blues!” It’s a happy, walkin’ blooz groove which evolves into a rompin’, stompin’ workout for the band and trombonist Andy Martin.\n\nWorks by Neil Hefti, Stevie Wonder, along with original compositions by Siebels keep the set enjoyable and unpredictable. A powerhouse presentation of Lalo Schifrin’s “The Cat,” while great at almost four minutes, should have been at least twice as long – one of the few times when “less-is-more” gives way to Mae West’s admonition, “You can’t get too much of a good thing.”\n\nThe Blue Note 7: Mosaic (Blue Note: 50999-2-28123-2-2)\n\n70 years have passed since Alfred Lion and Frank Wolff founded the internationally known and respected Blue Note Record Label, famous for discovering, promoting, and recording great artists playing pure jazz.\n\nTo commemorate their 70th Anniversary, the label put together a septet of all-stars to create this dynamic tribute: Nicholas Payton on trumpet, Steve Wilson on alto, Ravi Coltrane on tenor, Peter Bernstein on guitar, Bill Charlap on piano, Peter Washington on bass, and Lewis Nash on drums.\n\nThe eight compositions selected are equally impressive, with works by such stellar Blue Note artists as Cedar Walton, Joe Henderson, McCoy Tyner, Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson, Duke Pearson, and Horace Silver.\n\nThe set opens with the title track, “Mosaic,” a spirited rouser composed by Walton and a major hit for Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. Everyone cooks on this, with outstanding ensemble and solo contributions by all.\n\nJoe Henderson’s “Inner Urge” is rhythmically inventive, balanced nicely by the grace and beauty of McCoy Tyner’s “Search For Peace.” The variety continues with a sprightly outing on Monk’s “Criss Cross,” ultimately wrapping up with a brisk, funky workout on Horace Silver’s “The Outlaw.” The other selections are lilting and poetic, bloozy shuffles, latin, and noir-moody, making this a jazzily righteous way to say, “Happy 70th Anniversary, Blue Note!\n\nJust a Little Taste: Al Hood Plays The Writing of Dave Hanson (ahood@du.edu)\n\n“Grace, elegance, peace, beauty, introspection” are words that describe this outstanding program. Notice that the word “boring” does not appear.\n\nGranted, this is not the CD you’ll put on the player for your next brawl; it is however one that will satisfy completely when you need some music to enhance your Garbo-ish “I Vant To Be Alone” moods and moments.\n\nEssentially, the CD is a trumpet lead in front of a 10-piece string orchestra. On various selections you’ll hear trumpeter Al Hood and pianist Dave Hanson as the only out-front soloists, while on others, they’re joined by bass, drums, oboe, flute, French horn, clarinet, and saxes. This is “orchestral jazz,“ a form, while used occasionally, is neither commonplace nor standard for either players or listeners.\n\nTrumpeter Hood instantly acknowledges his trumpet influences, and evokes them all, which explains the CD title, “Just A Little Taste.”\n\nA languid, lush’n’lazy homage is paid to trumpet legend, Clifford Brown on the CD opener, “I Remember Clifford,” the jazz classic written by Benny Golson. “Pure Imagination“ follows. It’s a bright, buoyant visit to “Willie Wonka’s Chocolate Factory” and rivals the megahit from that show, “The Candy Man.”\n\nShimmering strings and mellow flugelhorn highlight “In The Wee Small Hours of the Morning,” while “Ceora,” a composition by trumpet legend Lee Morgan evokes both Morgan and Brown.\n\nThe title track is the only up-tempo track on the set: a boppish, exuberant romp that features an impressive, swinging “brass choir” sound in some sections.\n\nApril 2009\n\nCLASSIC MILES, GOODWIN SWING, WRIGHT-EOUS SAX HIGHLIGHT APRIL JAZZ RELEASES\n\nDiversity of discs offers jazz for every listening taste\n\nUsually da Owl jazz-grousing bemoans the fact that for some reason, the international CD producers tend to release similarly instrumented or themed albums at the same time. So, one month, I’ll get new CDs featuring nine trumpet players, another month, 15 guitar trios, another month, eight sax players, seven bop bassists, six Latino sextets, and a piano in a pear tree – all of which make programming my Sunday show a difficulty. I can’t, and don’t want, any one instrument, style, tempo, or sound to dominate my meager three-hour airtime.\n\nSurprisingly, enjoyably, the March-April releases proved to be different in that, for once, a wide range of styles, instrumentations and jazz concepts arrived at the intergalactically renowned Nite Owl Jazz Entertainment Megaplex and Pleasuredome. Three of the best, most-diverse were ...\n\nMiles Davis: Kind of Blue (Legacy Edition) (Columbia/Legacy: 88697-45885-2)\n\nThis timeless CD is universally regarded, respected, and revered by jazz critics and audiences alike. It is the best-selling jazz album ever and rated #12 in “Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.” The music is spontaneous, with an expressive, sustained mood, great solos by all, evoking instant communication with first-time and traditional jazz listeners alike.\n\nMore importantly, this is the CD that essentially moved jazz beyond bebop. It introduced the new concept of modal jazz to a vast audience; a CD that in style, approach, construction, sound, and new musical concepts has influenced just about every jazz player, critic, composer, educator, and listener ever since.\n\nRecorded in March 1959, it features Miles’ first great sextet featuring Cannonball Adderly on alto, John Coltrane on tenor, Bill Evans or Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Jimmy Cobb, now the only surviving menber of the group, on drums.\n\nThis two-disc “Legacy Edition” is an affordable alternative to the expensive, lavishly designed 12-inch-slipcased box-set of the Kind Of Blue 50th Anniversary Collectors Edition presented last year.\n\nOn Disc-1, the five tunes that made up the initial 1959 vinyl release are presented as on the original, along with the addition of a complete, slightly longer, alternative take on “Flamenco Sketches,” followed by such extras as a series of studio sequences for the original five titles and one “false start” for “Freddy The Freeloader.”\n\nDisc-2 goes back to sessions recorded in 1958, featuring, now rightfully united for the first time on one CD, the only studio recording sessions made by this iconic sextet. As an added bonus, there’s a “previously released in unauthorized form” 17-minutes-plus version of “So What,” (minus Cannonball) recorded in Holland in 1960.\n\nUndeniably, this Legacy Edition is a CD that should be a part of every jazz collection.\n\nSwing Masters: Vol. 2: Benny – King of Swing (Dare Records: DRR-200202-2)\n\nThe jazz style known as swing was the most popular music of the mid-‘30s to late-‘40s. It had been around for a while before it was propelled into national popularity by the Benny Goodman Band in a 1935 performance at the Palomar Ballroom. It was big band jazz in the black style à la Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Benny Moten and others, in those days, primarily known only to audiences in Harlem, Kansas City, and Chicago. Goodman, plus radio, college students, ballrooms and national concerts all contributed to his title as “King of Swing.” The music was smooth, driving, flawlessly played, highly disciplined jazz at its best.\n\nThese same qualities are evident in this homage program by the Swing Masters, a 13-piece band, six of whom were members of various Goodman Bands, including leader-clarinetist Ken Peplowski, who dynamically re-creates the fragile tone, liquid sound, blooziness, and upper-register wail originally so easily presented by Goodman-the-Great.\n\nThe charts are very close to the originals – tweaked, changed only slightly, to add a dash of 21st-century ambience to the original ‘40s swing sound – the result being both authentic ‘40s with the overtly dated elements removed.\n\nFourteen of “Benny’s Biggest” are included in the set, the highlight being an almost 12-minute version of the Louis Prima composition “Sing, Sing, Sing,” an instant, internationally revered showpiece at Goodman’s 1939 Carnegie Hall appearance, primarily due to the drumming of Gene Krupa, whose takes on that tune are still quoted today. Drummer Chuck Redd faces and answers the Krupa challenge with power, style, and imagination – keeping Krupa constant but adding a few modern touches of his own.\n\nNancy Wright - with the Tony Monaco Trio: Moanin’ (Chicken Coup Records: CCP-7013)\n\nI’ve been a fan of the tenor-sax/B-3 quartet for as long as I’ve had ears. So it was great to hear this debut CD from Nancy Wright, an Ohio native, who originally waitressed at Gilly’s in Dayton on weeknights, but sat in as guest-tenor sax for the big name jazz players who performed on weekends.\n\nHer tenor personifies that big-toned, warm, sexy-sensual, blooze-drenched sound so familiar to fans of Houston Person, Gene Ammons, and Ben Webster, to name a few of her influences.\n\nShe soulfully shows her prowess on blues, ballads, bop, and boogooloo on 10 trax, four of which she wrote, the others by such outstanding composers as Bobby Timmons, Gigi Gryce, Cole Porter and others.\n\nShe’s aided and abetted on this superbly swingin’ program by CD-producer Tony Monaco, who burns on the B-3, Robert Kraut on guitar, and Louis Tsamous on drums.\n\nFebruary 2009\n\nJAZZ WITH FRITZ: 50TH YEAR ON COLUMBUS RADIO!\n\nTimeless CDs reverently recalled, remembered, recommended\n\nPossibly, perhaps, perchance it was the L-tryptophan in the Thanksgiving turkey, the rush of the holidays, or even, maybe, an overdose of dark-chocolate-infused cookies and candies that caused me to overlook my most recent career chapter: namely, the start of my 50th year on Columbus radio this past November, with jazz always a major part of my airwork.\n\nIn the course of those years, I played music in a variety of formats: pop, rock, Top-40, classical, adult-contemporary and folk to name a few. However, whatever the format, even on TV, I was always able to work some jazz into it or had a separate “stand alone” jazz program on the side. My current show, “Nite Owl Jazz” started its 8th year on Smooth Jazz WJZA-WJZK-FM in January and will start its 18th consecutive year on the air in Central Ohio in mid-April.\n\nWhile jazz, as with most other art forms, has changed and evolved over the years, there are countless albums that are timeless – albums that sound as fresh, new, and good today as when they were originally recorded. I’ve heard, shared, and played many of these for my audiences.\n\nHere are a very few of the older great “sounds-recalled” CDs that you’ll still enjoy today, listed by artist, CD title, label, and catalogue number. Bear in mind, however, I’m not saying these are the greatest jazz albums ever recorded, only that these were terrific listening back then, are now, and will be 10 years from now.\n\nTeddy Edwards: Good Gravy (Contemporary OJCCD-661-2 (S-7592))\n\nTeddy Edwards, along with Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray, was one of the top three young tenor sax players of the late ‘40s. Teddy’s “tenor duel” with “Long-Tall-Dexter” was a milestone in jazz and helped give both players legendary status. While many other tenor men were “inner-directed” and seemed to “play for themselves,” Teddy was always communicative; when he plays it seems like he’s talking to you.\n\nWhile just about any of his albums are worth having, Good Gravy from 1962 is my favorite. The opening title track, written by Teddy (as were three others), was used as the theme for many of my radio and TV shows. It “walks” warmly in a medium groove and sets the tone for the varied jazz delights that follow, including four brisk swingers, a Latin-lope, and two sensual ballads: “Stairway to the Stars” and one of the most gorgeously played versions of “Laura” ever recorded. On various tracks he’s backed by such jazz heavyweights as Phineas Newborn, Jr., Danny Horton, Leroy Vinnegar and Milt Turner.\n\nAs a side note, Teddy’s label, Contemporary, is outstanding. Just about everything they produced-released was “A-plus-with-clusters” in content, production, sound.\n\nJimmy Smith: Sum Serious Blues (Milestone-MCD-9207-2)\n\nAs with Teddy, there ain’t no such thing as a Jimmy Smith CD that’s not worth hearing.\n\nHe always has his “mojo/roog-o-later” workin’ and cookin’ to da max. From the many superb Smith sessions available, I have a fondness for this one. ’Tis somewhat unusual in that it is one of the CDs that present the B-3 burner fronting a 10-piece all-star band, featuring such hall-of-famers as George Bohanan, Oscar Brashear, Buddy Collette, Phillip Upchurch, and Andy Simpkins, to name just five. In addition, in the eight-song program, there are three bluesy vocals, one of which is sung by Jimmy himself.\n\nYou’ll go a long time before you hear a more impressive, good-time sound than the title track.\n\nIt opens big, with everyone wailin’ and walkin’ for eight minutes of solid swingin’ jazz, highlighted by Smith’s smokin’ B-3, tight ensemble sections, and outstanding solos. If you ain’t clappin’ your hands, tappin’ your foot while this is playing, check your pulse, you may have died.\n\nWhile each of the eight lengthy tracks is a winner, I had a particular fondness for Jimmy’s soulful vocal on “Hurry Change, If You’re Comin’,” his classic organ solo on his original composition “The Sermon,” Mick Martin’s harmonica work on “Moof’s Blues,” and the hiply humorous Marlena Shaw vocal on “You’ve Changed.”\n\nGreg Abate Quintet: Featuring Richie Cole: Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (Candid-CCD-79715)\n\nGreg Abate and Richie Cole are household names in the world of jazz, but not beyond. Both are heavyweight, hall-of-fame Bebop saxmeisters in the front rank; both have innumerable audience and critically acclaimed recordings and live performances to their credit.\n\nOn this set, recorded live at Chan’s, a Chinese restaurant in Abate’s hometown of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, in 1994, the two saxmen present blues, ballads, and bop as they should be played and heard.\n\nAbate demonstrates his prowess on soprano, alto, tenor, bari, and flute throughout the program, while Cole burns strictly on alto. They roar-soar on dueling altos through the blazing opener, “Fast Lane Rhythm,” which gives each incendiary solos and tight unison collaborations. It’s bop at its best, rivaled easily by their work on their two-alto bop-tized workouts on “Chan’s House of Jazz” and “Parallel.” These are my two favorite trax on the album, both showing unmistakable Charlie Parker influences.\n\nA taste of West-coast Blue-Bop, some loping-Latin and two romantic, sensual, steam-the-windows, fog-your-lenses ballads contribute to the overall variety and “listen anytime” appeal of this crowd-pleasing performance. ‘Tis good that the hometown Woonsocketians got to hear it live; equally good that Candid Records had the taste and foresight to record and release it for everyone, everywhere, to enjoy for years to come.\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nSWING SOUNDS FINE TO START '09!\n\nHampton, Goodman, and Krupa honored in new series\n\nIn the early days of dance-jazz, it was two-beats-to-the-bar with strings and sweetness. However, by the late-1920s, audiences wanted an edgier, smoother, more sophisticated sound. So, two beats increased to four, and the groups now featured horns, syncopation, improvisation, and other innovations. Due to the smooth-but-exciting rhythms, the music became known as “swing.”\n\nIt was equally enjoyable as music for dancing or just listening. (“I give it a nine and you can dance to it.”)\n\nThis new sound fascinated audiences from the beginning, but a 1935 Palomar Ballroom appearance by Benny Goodman propelled the style to national renown and popularity. From the mid-1930s until the early-fifties, swing eclipsed all other types of music in audience acceptance and sales. This was the only time when the people ranked jazz as America’s most popular music.\n\nIn addition, elements of swing influenced numerous singers, including Sinatra, Torme, Lee, Cole, Eckstein, Bennett, London, and such current artists as Lavay Smith, Brian Setzer, Royal Crown Revue, and Squirrel Nut Zippers.\n\nGranted, swing hasn’t held a top position in music for over five decades, but it still has a respectably sized audience of all ages who enjoy its sound, style, and evolution over the years. These are the people who will thoroughly thrill to the “new-for-the-New-Year” Swing Masters Series, which pays tribute to the timeless sounds of the swing greats.\n\nThe series in unique in many ways. In addition to re-recording the numerous hits, many of the seven musicians who make up Swing Masters actually performed with the legendary musicians honored in the recordings.\n\nThree individual CDs introduce the series. The Swing Masters pay homage to the music of Benny Goodman in Vol. 2: The King of Swing, available January 13, followed by Vol. 3: Gene Krupa: Jazz Pioneer on February 10, and the currently available:\n\nSwing Masters: Vol. 1: Happy Birthday: Lionel: (DARE Records: DRR200200-2)\n\nLionel Hampton first recorded with Louis Armstrong in 1930. He was the first musician to improvise and record on the vibraphone and gained international fame as a member of the Benny Goodman Band in 1936. Throughout his career, he was universally recognized as a jazz pioneer, legend, icon, innovator, and leader in the world of swing. He performed actively until his death at age 94 in 2002, but his musicianship lives on, as heard on this lively collection.\n\nVeteran vibist Chuck Redd, a member of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra, has the honor and challenge of re-creating the Hampton sound, approach, and style. He does this easily, breezily on each of the 15 tracks, romping his way through some of Hampton’s most exciting and memorable solos, as heard on “Flying Home,” “Airmail Special,” and “Runnin’ Wild,” to name just three. He’s mellow and bloozy on the Hampton-composed “Red Top,” light, hip, and humorous on Lionel’s “Hey Ba Ba Re Bop,” which features a classic vocal by group-guest Janis Siegal on loan from Manhattan Transfer.\n\nThe authenticity of the solidly swingin’ Hampton sound is ensured in that four of the seven musicians were members of Lionel’s band: Ken Peplowski on clarinet and tenor, Warren Vache on trumpet, Frank Vignola on guitar, John Bunch on piano. Along with vibist Redd, the group features the bass and drums of Pete Coco and Rich Zukor. Added guests include violinist Aaron Weinstein and vocalists Mark Kibble of Take 6 and Jane Monheit.\n\nIf swing’s your thing, you’ll go a long time before you hear better than this.\n\nFrank Derrick: The Beat Goes On (JazzedMedia: JM-1035)\n\n‘Tis rare to encounter a jazz album that covers so many of the jazz bases: blues, ballads, bop – big band, Latin, swing – and group size. In its 12 tracks, this CD easily does the job.\n\nIn an unusual twist, six tunes are performed by a powerhouse 17-piece big band, the other six by an all-star quintet: the common denominator being the leader, drummer Frank Derrick. Saxman Billy Ross, trumpeter Melton Mustafa, pianist George Caldwell, and bassist Chuck Bergeron are just a few of the heavyweights who contribute.\n\nThe selections honor Derrick’s drumming idols, Buddy Rich, Art Blakey, Max Roach, and Roy Haynes. As with the Hampton CD above, Derrick doesn’t just copy his influences, rather, he evokes their sound and approach, while adding his own personal innovations.\n\nThe set opens with a blistering big band blast on “And Away We Go,” the theme for a TV show, performed by Rich. The quintet counters with an imaginative outing on the Derrick-composed “Conquest,” which conjures Blakey. Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo Ala Turk” balances the 9/8-time with its 4/4 transitions, and adds a fresh feel to this jazz classic.\n\nThe title track by Sonny and Cher cooks on all burners, and is one of my favorites – equaled by the modern dance work by Richard Rodgers, “Slaughter On Tenth Avenue.” I first saw this work, at age 14, danced by Gene Kelly and the spectacularly cantilevered Vera Ellen in the classic 1948 MGM musical “Words and Music.” I fell instantly in love with Vera in her yellow t-shirt and slit skirt, along with the music. While Derrick can’t duplicate Ms. Ellen, he easily handles the 6/8 time with the swing, mystery, and excitement of the original.\n\nDecember 2008\n\nNEW HOLIDAY JAZZ DECKS THE HALLS WITH SWINGS SO JOLLY !\n\nCurrent crop of CDs great for giving or adding a festive sound to your home\n\nGood Grief! I just wrapped up my Holiday card-sending and gift-giving for Christmas 1996, and already it’s time to do it again. One of these years I may catch up (but not bloody likely, as da Owl don’t like to rush into things).\n\nNevertheless, for those of you who are more practical, punctual, and in-the-present, here are a few jazz CDs that will please any jazz lover on your gift list. All are recent albums issued in the last month or two, so chances are excellent that your recipient does not have them.\n\nJazz-guitar fanatics will go bonkers for:\n\nDon Hales: Unified String Theory (Chicken Coup Records: CCP 7011)\n\nDon Hales is, and has been for years, one of Central Ohio’s semi-hidden jazz treasures. A guitarist with champion chops, ‘tis a puzzlement that he’s not been recorded more often. So be it. On this swingin’ session, he displays, on all eight tracks, his complete mastery of the fretboard.\n\nBacked by B-3 burner Tony Monaco, who produced the CD, along with Andy Woodson on bass, Kris Keith on flute and tenor, and Matt Wagner on drums, Don displays his incredible prowess as he glides and romps his way through a superb selection of six Hales-composed originals and two semi-standards by others.\n\nMood, tempo, style, and approach vary track-to-track, giving the set an exciting and unpredictable variety. In addition, all the players get ample space to display their considerable talents as sidemen and soloists.\n\nAmong the many highlights are the opener, a straight-ahead swinger, “Strawberries-Raspberries,” followed by a light, funky bossa “Seaweed Song,” featuring fabulous fluting by Keith along with the fluid fingering of Hales and an easy-flowing groove by all. “Breath of the Blues,” which closes the set, is a superb, nearly 11-minute-long exploration of one of the jazz basics.\n\nBig band enthusiasts will go a long time before they hear a better collection than:\n\nGordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band: Act Your Age (Immergent Records: 281147-2)\n\nThis 17-piece powerhouse, led by pianist-saxman Gordon Goodwin, is fast becoming one of the most critically acclaimed and popular big bands on the planet. In this 12-song program, they roar or purr their way through songs written by such heavyweights as Herbie Hancock, Maurice White, Kern & Harbach, Chick Corea, and Dave Grusin, along with six originals by Goodwin.\n\nThe many full-band ensemble passages are totally tight and exhilarating, amplified by superb solos by such renowned players as Eric Marienthal, Lee Ritenour, Chick Corea, Nathan East, Andy Martin, Wayne Bergeron and on one track, courtesy of magic, or perchance modern recording technology, the legendary, late-great-piano-colossus Art Tatum!\n\nEvery track is outstanding. Among my favorites are a rousing, carousing re-meeting with “Watermelon Man,” the funky title track, “Act Your Age,” and the foot-tapping, finger-snapping “Backrow Politics.”\n\nIn addition to the CD, the set includes a DVD, which contains the complete musical program with on-screen liner notes, live concert videos featuring some music not heard on the CD, track-by-track commentaries with photos, interviews with some of the musicians and much more. As a jazz audio-video gift to a big band booster, or as timeless enjoyment for you, this CD and DVD can’t be beat!\n\nChildren of all ages will thoroughly enjoy:\n\nMr. Rogers Swings! Holly Yarbrough Sings the Fred Rogers Songbook (Vintage Discs.com)\n\nThis absolutely charming collection includes 16 of the favorite songs written by, and featured on The Mr. Rogers TV Show. Backed by a superb nine-piece band, with outstanding jazz arrangements, singer Holly Yarbrough brings new life and goodwill to these marvelous compositions written by Fred Rogers. From the opening “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” to the closing “It’s Such a Good Feeling,” the easy-going amiability and warmth of Mr. Rogers is re-established with swing and style.\n\nAs for new takes on some of your traditional Holiday favorites, both religious and popular, try:\n\nTyphanie Monique, Neal Alger & Friends: Yuletide Groove TYME-002\n\nWhile singer Typhanie Monique and guitarist Neal Alger usually peform as a duo, this outing finds them in a variety of groups, ranging from their basic duo to sextet. In addition to covering 10 of the more familiar carols, they also add such rarely heard but no less-holiday-oriented songs as “Happy Christmas (War Is Over)” by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, performed in a funk-groove style, featuring the always-exciting B-3 of guest Tony Monaco. “Someday At Christmas,” by Stevie Wonder, is set in a soulful-groove by the duo, who become warm and cuddly on “A Merrier Christmas” composed by none other than Thelonious Monk. The CD closer, “Goodnight, Wherever You Are,” features some fine vocal support from Monaco, who also “plays pretty for the people” with a dreamy solo.\n\nA full sextet romps on “Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree,” but gets sassy and salsa-splashed for “Santa Baby,” which also boasts some superb trumpet work by guest Victor Garcia. “The Little Drummer Boy” is street-wise, jazzy, and hip-hop, thanks to the beatboxing of guest JAQ, while the Charlie Brown favorite, “Christmas Time Is Here,” is both mellow and bright. A quartet swings for “We Three Kings,” and the weatherperson’s meteorologically correct terminology for a frigid forecast, “Baby It’s Cold Outside.”\n\nNovember 2008\n\nFAMOUS JAZZ ORCHESTRA MAKES DREAMS COME TRUE FOR BIG BAND LOVERS! Master chef/orchestra leader Vaughn Wiester cooks creatively on latest live recording\n\n“Dreams Come True” is not only a great title for this rousing, recently released recording by the Famous Jazz Orchestra, it’s also an accurate three-word description of FJO leader, Vaughn Wiester’s, musical career which began while a high school student in Mount Vernon, Ohio.\n\nThere, thanks to his music teacher Bob Bechtel, Vaughn was introduced to the sounds of big, bold brass and innovative chords as created by Stan Kenton. He continued his musical journey as a trombonist in the Navy.\n\nHe returned to life as a landlubber in 1968 and enrolled as a music major at The Ohio State University. In addition to his studies, he played professional-paying gigs with the Dave Workman Blues Band and many other local and regional groups.\n\nIn 1972, he became a player-arranger for the Jazz Arts Group (now the Columbus Jazz Orchestra), then led by its founder, Ray Eubanks. This was followed by a two-year stay as a player and arranger for the Woody Herman Band in 1974. While with Herman, he performed on two internationally released albums and arranged other charts, which included a highly acclaimed arrangement of the Charles Mingus classic “Duke Ellington’s Sound of Love.”\n\nReturning to Columbus, he performed, taught, and arranged for the Dave Wheeler Contemporary Music Workshop. In 1977 he joined the faculty at Capital University, teaching courses in jazz arranging and jazz history. He also directed Capital’s award-winning Big Band Sound Big Band. This 17-year run was interspersed with playing and arranging for the world-renowned Terry Waldo Ragtime Orchestra.\n\nWiester was inducted as an Honorary Member of the national music fraternity, Phi Mu Alpha, in 1992, the same year he founded the Famous Jazz Orchestra, which was applauded by big band aficionados in countless appearances, the most notable being a continuous 11-year run (every Monday night) at the Columbus Music Hall, owned and directed by Becky Ogden. You’ll hear and feel the energy and excitement of these Music Hall performances, recorded live this year and last, on:\n\nDreams Come True: Vaughn Wiester’s Famous Jazz Orchestra: More Live Recordings! (CoJAZZ-CJ-1038)\n\nBriefly, the CD’s title reflects Vaughn’s optimistic “Dreams-to-Reality” beliefs in that three of the tracks are arrangements-commissions specifically created for him and the FJO by Bill Holman (one of Wiester’s musical heroes/major influences), Bill Matthieu, and Roland Paolucci who co-commissioned to Holman a composition titled “Theme And Variations #3.” The complete “Dreams Come True” story is fully recounted in Wiester’s informative liner notes, which also include the 22-piece orchestra’s roster and the outstanding soloists on each of the 14 tracks.\n\nThe mood, tone, and thrust of the set opens with an industrial-strength swinger, “Boo Boo Be Doop.” This is a tune that Bill Holman wrote for Stan Kenton in 1952, which he restored exclusively for the FJO. Missing from the musical scene for nearly 50-years, it cooks on all burners, with great ensemble passages and individual solos.\n\nThe tempo mellows a bit for “Wailin’ In The Woodshed,” from the Woody Herman bandbook, but roars again on the straight-ahead Thad Jones compostition, “Interloper.”\n\nSuffice it to say, every track is a winner, but special mention must be made about “Theme and Variations #3.” This unique composition features varying tempos and moods and is full orchestra throughout, with no solos whatever. It had its premier performance in Columbus, with the iconic Bill Holman himself leading the orchestra.\n\nFor the big band fanatic on any of your gift lists, birthday, anniversary, holiday, whatever, this is the perfect present.\n\nAs a final note, the Famous Jazz Orchestra can be seen, heard, enjoyed live every Monday night, 7:30 to 11 p.m. at the Columbus Maennerchor, 966 South High St., in German Village.\n\nThe Memphis Hang: Jim Shearer and Charlie Wood Summit Records: DCD-502\n\nAs the lowest-pitched brass instrument, the sound from both the tuba and the sousaphone is essentially the same – warm, full, and rich – providing the low, bottom-end range for all types of music.\n\nThe main difference between a tuba and a sousaphone is the shape. The tuba resembles an extra-large baritone horn. It is arm-held if the player is standing, or rests on one’s lap or a tuba-stand if the player is sitting. The sousaphone is larger, wraps around the player’s body and is supported by one’s shoulder, making it much easier to hold and play.\n\nGenerally, the tuba is most often used in classical concert music, Dixieland, traditional German-folk and other forms. The sousaphone, while it could (and often, does) participate in the same types of music, is most often found in marching bands. Thus, it will ALWAYS be a sousaphone that “dots the i” in the script Ohio. So much for The Owl’s tuba-sousaphone overview.\n\nRarely is the tuba used as a lead instrument. But, there are exceptions to everything, and it’s the tuba that frontlines this totally swinging set for which tuba-leader Jim Shearer put together an unusual sextet, comprised of himself on tuba, co-leader Wood on B-3 and vocals, trumpet, harmonica, guitar, and drums. It expands to a septet on one track with acoustic bass.\n\nThe overall sound is quite unlike anything you may have heard in other jazz combos, but it works in all cases. Imaginative tuba solos highlight every track. The 11-selections range from Thelonious Monk through Big Bill Broonzy to Leonard Bernstein/Steven Sondheim. Now that’s variety, which the group handles with breeze and ease!\n\nSeptember 2008\n\nBURNING B-3 BY BOBBY PIERCE SETS ORGAN-JAZZ FANS AFIRE! Central Ohio keyboard master releases his first new CD in 34 years\n\nWhile he’s been absent from the Central Ohio music scene for over three decades, most long-time local jazz fans are still in awe of and enthusiastically remember Bobby Pierce, organist, pianist, keyboardist, composer, and singer.\n\nBobby’s Columbus roots and musical education run deep: a piano-playing mother, private local lessons, formal schooling along with music at St. Dominic’s, Champion Jr. High, and Columbus East; his first local recording and airplay on WVKO Radio in his early teens; B-3 and piano gigs at all of the Central Ohio jazz clubs in the mid-60s through the early-70s and a dash beyond.\n\nHe and his boyhood, neighborhood pal, the late great pianist Geoff Tyus, spent many of their teen hours at the Lyon & Healy Music Store experimenting with the B-3. Geoff (with formal keyboard education at OSU and subsequent fame, started his studies as a young adult, after his stint as a Navy Seal) always acknowledged Bobby as his primary inspiration to pursue music as a career.\n\nSimilarly, Bobby never hesitates to mention and honor his many mentors, teachers, inspirations: Mr. Lanier at Champion Jr. High, Ted Turner at East in the early years, along with Central Ohio’s B-3 giants Hank Marr, Don Patterson, and Uncle Dave, to name a very few who generously gave advice, technical tips, moral support and inspiration in helping Bobby develop his own unique sound and approach.\n\nA few loose, possibly-not-consecutive adventures on his road since leaving Columbus include military service, road trips as an organist, pianist and/or vocalist with such jazz giants as James Moody, Sonny Stitt, Gene Ammons, along with uncountable studio backups for Etta James, Benny King, The Four Tops, Joe Williams, Dionne Warwick and others, which ultimately led to his first international album as a leader in 1972, Introducing Bobby Pierce on Cobblestone Records, followed in 1974 with New York on the Muse label.\n\nInternational tours with Ernie Andrews, Eddie Harris and Henry Franklin, studio work as a player for O.C. Smith, Harry “Sweets” Edison, Teddy Edwards and Joe Sample, movie and TV appearances as an on-screen performer or soundtrack musician in many shows, including Living Single, Red Shoes Diaries, The Rat Pack, Nutty Professor 2, and Becker, along with countless other live performances and musical projects have filled his years since leaving Columbus. As he states in his CD liner notes, “It would take another thirty-four years to tell you where I’ve been.”\n\nThus, while active musically, he’s not recorded a set featuring himself as leader, arranger, creator til now, 34 years after his initial albums from ‘72 and ‘74. The results of this long-overdue resurgence as a headliner can be heard and enjoyed on:\n\nBOBBY PIERCE: The Long Road Back (Doodlin Records: DR-008)\n\nBacked by a trio of tenor sax, guitar, and drums, Bobby works his way through four of his original compositions and four familiar standards. The opener, “Bobby’s Back,” is an easy-strollin’, feel-good blues romp. Guitarist Frank Potenza and tenor man Ricky Woodard’s happy solos are punctuated perfectly by Pierce-ing accents and fills before Bobby takes center stage and shows his considerable skills with some rapid multi-note improvisations and sustains which he manipulates with ease. It’s a great opener and moodsetter for the excitement to follow.\n\nThe tempo picks up for “One for Duff and Dink,” highlighted by Bobby’s unique chording and a crisp drum solo by Clarence Johnson. “Frenchie” combines earthy, soul-funk with hard bop, which contrasts nicely with a heartfelt, sensual, pensive treatment of “The Good Life.” I’ve heard many fine versions of this tune; Bobby’s is one of the best. The CD’s title track cooks from note one, with all players at their fiery best.\n\nOne of my favorites is Stevie Wonder‘s “Seems So Long,” the only vocal in the eight-song set, a romantic reminder that Bobby can sing with the best. This is timeless B-3 quartet jazz at its grooviest. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another 34 years for a sequel!\n\nDAVID BERGER OCTET: I Had the Craziest Dream: The Music of Harry Warren (Such Sweet Thunder: SST-2206)\n\nIt takes great arranging to make an eight-piece group (an octet) sound like a small big band or a big small band, but that’s exactly what David Berger and his Sultans of Swing do in this listener-friendly collection of incredibly familiar tunes by Harry Warren, one of the songwriter-icons included in The Great American Songbook. A pop (as opposed to a jazz) composer, most of his creations easily lend themselves to solid jazz interpretations, as demonstrated in this delightful collection.\n\nThe set opens with a bright, modern take on “Jeepers Creepers,” a song Louis Armstrong originally sang to a racehorse in a long-forgotten movie cartoon. It’s followed by a romantic instrumental version of “You’ll Never Know,” the Oscar-winning song for 1943, which became the theme song for the awesome actress-singer Alice Faye.\n\nThe CD teems with highlights galore: a swinging but relaxed “I Had the Craziest Dream,” a noir visit to the “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” the warm and touching trumpet work of Brian “Fletch” Pareschi on the melancholy “Serenade in Blue.”\n\nWho’da thought “The Gold Diggers’ song (aka:“We’re in The Money”) would work as a BeBop flagwaver, or that “I Only Have Eyes For You” could evolve into such a straight-ahead swinger? And, even Judy Garland would admit you’ll go a long time before you have a groovier ride “On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe,” with Berger’s easy, chugging, locomotive lope. This one’s for you AAO (All Aboard Ohio). Newbies and Nostalgia-buffs alike will definitely want this one in their CD collections.\n\nAugust 2008\n\nWILLIE & WYNTON: BROTHERS IN BLUES! Two diverse musical icons meet in rarely explored jazz-country\n\nAwesome amazement was an understatement when I opened my latest packet of CDs from Blue Note Records this month. People in my presence said they could actually HEAR my eyebrows rise in surprise. High on my list of unexpected collaborations was this CD:\n\nWillie Nelson – Wynton Marsalis: Two Men with the Blues (Blue Note 50999-5-04454-2-4)\n\nHowever, since the sub-theme of my Nite Owl Jazz radio show is “E-X-P-A-N-D your musical horizons – take the blinders off your ears – for what’s new in Jazz for the 21st Century,” I put my “you-gotta-be-kidding-with-this” attitude aside.\n\nI gave the CD an attentive and open-minded listen and was delighted with the musical results: an intriguing and enjoyable visit to the hitherto relatively unexplored soundscape of jazz-country – a mix that was equal parts down-home Nashville, uptown New York City, and Bourbon Street New Orleans, all drenched in the basics of the blues, aided and abetted with a slather of swing, a minimum of melancholy, and a helping of humor.\n\nThe CD is a recording of an event called “Willie Nelson Sings The Blues.” It was part of the “Singers Over Manhattan Series” presented in January 2007 by Jazz at Lincoln Center, for which Wynton Marsalis is a major producer-programmer.\n\nThis was a historic summit meeting of diverse American Music icons, Willie and Wynton, two of the most significant figures in modern-day country music and jazz. Both are multiple Grammy and other award winners; both are regarded as artistic innovators and leaders in their respective fields; both discovered a common ground in the basic American music, the blues. Hence, this concert.\n\nOn stage for the event were Nelson, in his “outlaw” basic-black Southwestern threads, along with his longtime sideman, harmonica-virtuoso Mickey Raphael in a suit. They were accompanied by the always elegantly attired Marsalis and his equally spiffy-suited quartet: pianist Dan Nimmer, bassist Carlos Henriquez, drummer Ali Jackson, and saxman Walter Blanding. Their music blended as well as their sartorial sensibilities.\n\nThe opener, “Bright Lights, Big City,” sets the mood of big-city-meets-country. Wailing harmonica, cool trumpet, raunchy sax, and a dash of boogie woogie add to Willie’s vocalization and bluesy guitar. The mood changes to smoky and sensual for the Nelson-composed “Night Life,” with Wynton at his warmest in a blues-ballad mode, synergized by Raphael’s high and lonesome harmonica. “Caledonia,” usually a big band flag waver, gets a cooler and more restrained treatment, while “Rainy Day Blues” is walkin’ and boppish, with Blanding’s sax taking us to 52nd Street, and a Tower Of Power horn section.\n\nTwo Hoagy Carmichael classics, “Stardust” and “Georgia On My Mind,” are songs that have been performed by hundreds of other artists, but Nelson, with his intimate and heartfelt interpretation, makes them his own.\n\n“Basin Street Blues” gets a classic treatment by all. Willie rivals every jazz-blues singer ever to perform the classic “Ain’t Nobody’s Business.” In addition to his half-talkin’, half-singin’ rendition, he gets some added vocal interaction from Wynton. Add a “Texas-tenor” solo to the delight, and you get a great intro to the happy, inspiring, Gospel-grooved set-closer, “That’s All.”\n\nOther than the innovative, unexpected pairing of the primary participants, no new musical grounds were presented. However, if you like Willie, Wynton, country, jazz, and/or blues, you’ll like this set. It’s “in the pocket,” timeless, listen-and-enjoy-anytime: a solid, enjoyable collaboration first track to finish!\n\nTHE STEIN BROTHERS QUINTET: Quixotic: (JazzEd Media: JM-1034)\n\nMy Owl-Ears have always been open to the bright, buoyant sounds of BeBop, marvelously presented by two newcomers to the world of Jazz: the Stein Brothers, in this, their debut recording, reminiscent of, and influenced by such groups as led by Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Bird, Diz, Bud, and Barry Harris, one of their mentors, to name a few.\n\nThese bop-based brothers add a slightly new twist to the music of their predecessors. Instead of a frontline of trumpet and sax, they present a two-sax lead with Asher Stein on alto and brother Alex on tenor. Their approach varies to a degree: Asher on alto is lighter, more-ethereal, as opposed to the more-soulful, sensual-tenor of brother Alex. This variance adds immeasurably to the overall group sound.\n\nThey’re backed by pianist Mferghu (I haven’t the vaguest as to how his name is pronounced, but so what? The guy knows how to manipulate a keyboard.), bassist Doug Largent and drummer Joe Blaxx. In addition, four of the other tracks feature guest appearances by trumpeter Duane Eubanks and trombonist Jonathan Voltzok, who add even more depth and variety to an already great-sounding group. Seven of the 12 tunes are never-before-heard originals by the Steins and Mferghu, along with standards by The Gershwins, Arlen-Mercer, and others.\n\nThe opening title track, “Quixotic,” combines the fire of Latin with the ice of cool, which lets the listener know that even though the concepts are historically traditional, the performances and arrangements are 21st Century.\n\nTrumpet and trombone join the quintet for a breezily boppish interpretation of the Barry Harris composition, “And So I Love You,” followed by one of the best instrumental versions of George Gershwin’s “Embraceable You,” featuring a sensual, soulful, steamy, sub-toned tenor open by Alex.\n\nAs with Willie and Wynton, no completely new sounds are presented here, but as with the aforementioned, this debut CD will easily stand the test of time and be an uplifting, musically mood-enhancing jazz experience for years to come.\n\nJULY 2008\n\nFEATHER TICKLES JAZZ BONE AND FUNNY BONE: Swing, satire, and lyrical hip humor highlight her new CD\n\nSome singers discover the world of jazz as they grow; others are born into it. Singer Lorraine Feather is one of the latter. Her father, Leonard Feather, is world-renowned as a jazz writer, reviewer, and music producer. His Encyclopedia of Jazz is one of the definitive and most-often-used reference books on the subject. Her mother, Jane, was a professional big band singer whose roommate in the early days was Peggy Lee. The legendary Billie Holiday is her godmother. The established stars, the young lions, the jazz leaders of the future were regular visitors. To her, “jazz” and “home” were synonymous.\n\nTheatre courses at Los Angeles City College prompted her return to NYC to pursue an acting career. She toured, did a few off-Broadway shows, and eventually appeared in the Broadway production of Jesus Christ Superstar. However, her major role in the World of Theatre was that of unemployed actress and waitress in innumerable restaurants, which motivated her to give singing a shot. From that point on, it was a slow but steady rise into the world of professional musicians.\n\nAlong the way, she sang backup for Petula Clark and Grand Funk Railroad, made her recording debut on an album for Concord Records, wrote original lyrics for such instrumental jazz classics as Ellington’s “Rockin’ in Rhythm,” the Yellowjackets’ “Ballad of the Whale,” and Horace Henderson’s “Big John’s Special,” which was featured in the Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell movie Swing Shift.\n\nHer lyrics for Disney movies and television, PBS, MGM, and other diverse productions (such as the opening ceremonies for the 1996 Summer Olympics) earned for her seven EMMY nominations over the years.\n\nHer singing career paralleled the success of her writing, with movie soundtrack vocal contributions to Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy, Bette Midler‘s For The Boys, and many others, numerous club and concert appearances, along with at least seven outstanding CDs, the latest being:\n\nLORRAINE FEATHER: Language JazzEd Media: JM-1032\n\nWhile most other jazz songs and singers deal with “love-found, lost, remembered,” Feather’s lyrics explore areas, problems and situations never before dealt with in song. The opener “Traffic and Weather” is a bright, brisk, tongue-in-cheek salute to that ubiquitous, inseparable pair heard on just about every morning radio show on the planet. A funky beat with ultrahip lyrics, delivered in Lorraine’s crisp, swingin’ style, counterbalanced nicely by guest Tierney Sutton, make this one a standout.\n\nThe subtle, somewhat laid-back “We Appreciate Your Patience” incorporates every mind-numbing, frustrating cliché rendered by those automated, computer-generated humanoids one hears while on “hold” waiting for a live customer service rep.\n\nSports cliches as a metaphor for life, misplaced car keys, waitressing, and the passing nature of fame are other familiar contemporary problems lyricized by Lorraine in her hip, humorous, and jazzy style.\n\nFor balance and variety, Feather adds a few guests along the way, including Yellowjackets’ pianist, Russell Ferrante, and Manhattan Transfer’s Cheryl Bentyne and Janis Seigel. And, in a more traditional mode, you’ll be emotionally touched by the bittersweet memories evoked in “I Love New York at Christmas,” the beauty of an elegant waltz evoking Strayhorn-Ellington, “In Flower,” and the romance of the closer, a gorgeous love ballad, a duet with pianist Michael Lang, “Making It Up As We Go Along.”\n\nCNY JAZZ ORCHESTRA: Then, Now & Again CNY Jazz Orchestra: cny-102\n\nThe Central New York (CNY) Jazz Orchestra was established in 1996 in Syracuse as a not-for-profit regional jazz orchestra to serve as a year-round provider of jazz to the Upstate and Central New York populace, with concerts, workshops, cabaret, festival and scholastic presentations.\n\nIt took ‘em 12 years, but this powerhouse big band recently released their debut CD. And what a big band treat it is! An assemblage of 17 jazz heavyweights, swingin’ their way through a 10-tune collection of originals and standards.\n\nConsiderate of your personal big band favorites – Basie, Herman, Jones-Lewis, Ferguson, whoever – here’s a CD that will please just about any taste.\n\nWho’da thought, or better yet, (conjure the Don Adams/Maxwell Smart voice) “Would you believe” the theme from TV’s Get Smart could lend itself to such a dynamic jazz presentation? It does indeed, complete with quotes from other TV themes of the times. A delight in all areas.\n\nThe Miles Davis/Ron Carter tune “Eighty One” features a trombone lead and a shimmering brass choir in an easy mid-tempo lope, which contrasts nicely with the melancholy elegance of the Gershwins’ “I Loves You Porgy,” highlighted by a show-stopping trumpet solo by Jeff Stockham, backed by blues-drenched ensemble sections by the entire band.\n\nThe theme from NPR’s “All Things Considered” swings solidly, as does the moving, multi-textured “Shimmer,” featuring fantastic French Horn jazz by the aforementioned Jeff Stockham, well-known as a member of the T.S. Monk Octet.\n\nEverything on this CD is a winner, but, for da Owl (unashamedly addicted to romantic-nostalgia), I melted at their laid-back closer, “Mister Sandman,” done in that easy, Basie “Li’l Darlin’” groove. This track alone was worth the price of the album.\n\nJUNE 2008\n\nLOCAL PLAYER TIM CUMMISKEY EXPANDS THE TRADITION OF GREAT JAZZ GUITAR\n\nLegendary Hank Marr in his final recording\n\nUnlike the trumpet, clarinet, piano, and drums, the guitar was not originally used as a leading or solo instrument in the early jazz bands. It was considered by most groups, regardless of size, primarily a rhythm instrument, but, thanks to its more sophisticated, mellower sound, was a logical replacement for the usually raucous, tinnier-sounding banjo.\n\nIt was Paris in the early ‘30s when a Belgian guitarist, Django Reinhardt, combined his Gypsy folk roots, the string band format of European popular music, and American jazz to create a unique sound that presented the acoustic guitar as a leading instrument. He was regarded as jazz musician of his time, equally outstanding whether demonstrating his explosive speed on the up-tempo swingers or his tender elegance and introspection on ballads. His outstanding technique was made even more-memorable in that he had lost two fingers of his left hand some years earlier. He was one of the earliest artists to be internationally known by his first name only. Woody Allen’s 1999 movie, Sweet and Lowdown, featuring a memorable jazz-guitar soundtrack, dealt specifically on the impact Django had, worldwide, on the jazz guitarists of the day.\n\nWhile Django was unique and astonished the jazz world with his acoustic guitar, it was the development of the electric guitar amplifier in the mid-’30s that allowed the guitar to stand out from the roar of big band brass and reeds, and rival them with sizzling solos and improvisation.\n\nA few others had experimented with the potential of the electric guitar early on, but Charlie Christian is the musician generally regarded as the first and most influential innovator on the instrument. As a member of Benny Goodman’s Sextet in 1939, he was the first to feature single-string solos, experiment with new harmonies and sounds. When bebop arrived shortly thereafter, Christian made the electric guitar a major solo instrument that could phrase like a sax, or equal a pianist’s right hand.\n\nHis prowess, concepts, and techniques influenced countless others, each of whom added their own creativity to expand the sound and versatility of the instrument. These included Barney Kessell, whom many regard, even today, as the most rhythmically vital guitarist in modern jazz. Jim Hall and Joe Pass added elements of classical elegance and introspection; Wes Montgomery’s innovative use of his thumb instead of guitar pick gave him considerable speed, the nickname “The Golden Thumb,” a softer, rounded, bluesier sound, and the ability to improvise in octaves.\n\nIn addition, 93-year-old Les Paul, regarded by most as “the father of modern electric guitar” played jazz occasionally, but his technical innovations and new recording techniques contributed immensely to the evolution and popularity of the instrument, and have been used to some degree by just about every amplified player to date.\n\nThese Christian-and-Paul-influenced guitarists and their descendants continue to inspire the best players of today.\n\nOne of these is Tim Cummiskey, a Central Ohioan known nationally as a highly talented player, equally at ease as a leader or sideman, in small groups or large. In addition to his performance abilities, he is also an educator, currently a member of the Jazz Studies faculty at The Ohio State University School of Music. He conducts numerous guitar clinics, contributes articles to Downbeat, Jazz Improv, and Just Jazz Guitar Magazine. His book “Learning Tunes Workout,” published by Mel Bay is available at Amazon.com.\n\nHe has been the leader on three CDs, the two most recent being:\n\nTHE TIM CUMMISKEY TRIO : Redeeming The Time – Hank Marr and Jim Rupp; TIM CUMMISKEY AND JACK WILKINS: Kindred – Andy Woodson and Jim Rupp\n\nThese two CDs vary considerably in sound and setting. Both however, demonstrate Cummiskey’s total command of the instrument, his formidable technique, improvisational abilities, and his skills as either a leader or sideman.\n\nRedeeming the Time is earthy and blues-drenched. Cummiskey balances his mellower, bluesier sound with his brighter, crisper attack. In addition, this CD has historical significance in that it is the last session recorded by the popular and iconic B-3 legend, the late, great Hank Marr, who, not surprisingly, is magnificent throughout. Both are supported by the dynamic drums of Jim Rupp. Cummiskey brings all of his jazz guitar concepts to this, one of the historically great B-3 configurations. Outstanding tracks, showing the harmonic challenge for Hank and Tim are heard on “Invitation,” “Inner Urge,” and their soulful, bluesy, co-written original, “Hank’s Riff.”\n\nKindred is brighter and more sophisticated due to the two-guitar front line, with guest-guitarist Jack Wilkins challenging, supporting, interchanging ideas with Cummiskey. Wilkins has been in the front ranks of jazz for over 40 years. Influenced by Reinhardt, Christian, Montgomery, and Pass, he’s known for his flawless technique and imaginative chordal approach, which counterpoint dramatically with Tim’s single line improvisations and chord explorations. Bassist Andy Woodson lays down a great bottom rhythm line, abetted again by the drums of the rousing Rupp. Outstanding tracks include “Like Someone I Know,” and “Body and Soul,” which demonstrate the interaction and empathy between the two players. This is one of the great jazz guitar duo recordings ever!\n\nBoth CDs present a solid, varied selection of tunes: jazz swingers, pop standards, and originals. If great jazz guitar is your passion, Cummiskey and company will satisfy to the nth!\n\nMAY 2008\n\nTHREE AMERICAN JAZZ MASTERS OUTSTANDING AS GUEST STARS\n\nSenior Citizens Jones, Heath, Hampton still swing like they’re in their twenties!\n\nWhile the mass public is probably not familiar with their names, just about every jazz fan on the planet recognizes these three longtime Hall of Fame performers: pianist Hank Jones, saxman Jimmy Heath, and the elegantly christened Locksley Wellington Hampton, best known by his nickname “Slide,” (which describes his profession) – one of the few left-handed trombonists in the universe.\n\nAll three have been big favorites with critics and audiences on the national/international jazz scene for well over a half-century; all three have been leaders or powerhouse sidemen on innumerable albums; all three have won countless awards, including multiple Grammy nominations, and most-prestigious of all, being named a “Jazz Master” by the National Endowment of the Arts.\n\nThey are all from musically oriented families, but only Jones and Heath have immediate family members who also enjoy mass national/international renown. The two younger brothers of Hank Jones – Thad, a trumpeter-composer-arranger big band leader, and Elvin, a super-drummer with such as Charles Mingus, Gil Evans and Miles Davis – easily rival their brother Hank in critical and audience acclaim.\n\nSimilarly Jimmy Heath’s older brother, Percy, is revered as the bassist for the incomparable MJQ (Modern Jazz Quartet), while his younger brother, Al, was a phenomenally successful drummer in numerous groups, including those of the Adderly Brothers and John Coltrane. Jimmy's son, Mtume, was percussionist for Herbie Hancock, and later, led his own successful urban contemporary-funk group, self-named \"Mtume.\"\n\nHank Jones is one of the few pianists equally at home in swing, bop, and pop. His imagination, taste, effortless technique, and perfection-of-touch make him a favorite as a leader of his own groups, a sideman with such legends as Charlie Parker and Artie Shaw, and an invigorating, inspirational accompanist to numerous vocalists, including Ella Fitzgerald, Billy Eckstein, and currently, Roberta Gambarini, a relatively new singer, with whom he now co-stars, supports, and accompanies on:\n\nYou Are There: ROBERTA GAMBARINI & HANK JONES (Emarcy-80010622-02)\n\nGambarini, born and raised in Turin, Italy, began as a clarinet player at age 12, but due to her clear alto voice, and inherent jazz talents, switched "
