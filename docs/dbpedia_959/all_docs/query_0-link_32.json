Sloan Foundation today announced selected titles for the second year of the Science + Literature program. The initiative identifies three books annually that deepen readers’ understanding of science and technology and focuses on highlighting the diversity of voices in contemporary science and technology writing. Authors receive a $10,000 cash prize, are celebrated at a ceremony in March, and will be featured in associated national public programming. The titles are selected by a committee of five scientific and literary experts, also announced today. The program is made possible by a three-year, $525,000 grant from the Sloan Foundation.\n\nThe three selected titles—all authored by queer writers of color—include a hybrid chapbook, a novel, and an essay collection. A blend of lyrical science writing, prose poem, and autofiction, Sabrina Imbler’s chapbook Dyke (geology) juxtaposes the lifecycles—and dating cycles—of both Hawaiian volcanoes and a queer human narrator, as they erupt and reveal new understandings of each other. Brandon Taylor’s debut novel Real Life follows Wallace, a queer Black man from Alabama who is pursuing a biochemistry degree in the Midwest, as he questions the pursuit of a career in science and what it means to live a “real life” in an environment steeped with racism, isolation, and repressed trauma. In Blockchain Chicken Farm: And Other Stories of Tech in China’s Countryside, Xiaowei R. Wang examines the intersection of politics, agriculture, and technology in China’s rural revitalization strategy. Wang shares case studies and personal stories—including their own family’s—to portray the knowns and unknowns of a rapidly changing world influenced by artificial intelligence and power.\n\n“These deeply engaging works—from stories rooted in science journalism and lived experiences to fictional narratives rich with scientific understanding—demonstrate the many ways in which science and technology permeate our everyday lives,” said Ruth Dickey, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. “This year’s selected titles contribute to a national conversation around the importance of diverse scientific writing and are sure to offer something for every kind of reader.”\n\n“We are delighted to join the National Book Foundation in recognizing these three powerful and unique writers engaging with scientific themes and characters across poetry, fiction, and nonfiction,” said Doron Weber, Vice President and Program Director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. “Science seeks to uncover universal truths about nature, but every human being’s lived experience is different and these gifted storytellers shine a light on the complex inner lives of their characters as they explore the mysteries of the external world. We’re proud to add these outstanding authors to Sloan’s nationwide book program, which has supported over 200 books from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winner American Prometheus and Margot Lee Shetterly’s Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race to this year’s Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology by Chris Miller and Vagina Obscura: An Anatomical Voyage by Rachel E. Gross.”\n\nAn in-person ceremony will be held on Wednesday, March 22, 2023, featuring readings and conversation with the selected authors. This year’s ceremony will be free and open to the public, and is presented in partnership with The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a distinguished private college of art, architecture and engineering founded in 1859 by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper.\n\nThe 2023 selection committee includes authors and scientists whose work across fields make science and the humanities more accessible for everyone. Ben Green is a postdoctoral scholar in the Michigan Society of Fellows and the author of The Smart Enough City: Putting Technology in Its Place to Reclaim our Urban Future; J. Drew Lanham is a Professor of Wildlife Ecology at Clemson University, a 2022 MacArthur Fellow, and the author of The Home Place: Memoirs of a Colored Man’s Love Affair with Nature; Latif Nasser is the host of WNYC’s Radiolab and Netflix’s Connected; Aimee Nezhukumatathil (Chair) is the author of World of Wonders: In Praise of Fireflies, Whale Sharks, & Other Astonishments and poetry editor of Sierra magazine; and Weike Wang is the author of Chemistry and Joan Is Okay, and is a National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 honoree.\n\n“Now in its second year, Science + Literature continues to identify books and writers that break down complex scientific concepts through exceptional storytelling,” said David Steinberger, Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Book Foundation. “We are grateful to the Sloan Foundation, this year’s selection committee, and our national programming partners, whose generous support makes Science + Literature possible.”\n\nPublic events featuring the selected authors will take place in cities across the country in Spring 2023 following the March ceremony, including with partners at the Chicago Humanities Festival in Chicago, IL, which connects people to the ideas that shape and define us, and promotes the lifelong exploration of what it means to be human; the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in Los Angeles, CA, which, since 1996 has gathered writers, poets, artists, filmmakers, musicians, and emerging storytellers; and Boise State University, a public research university in Boise, ID focused on student success with an innovation mindset.

In April 2022, regrants were made to 313 nonprofit literary arts organizations and publishers.\n\nAcross both funding cycles, data was collected from applicants, which included information about finances, programs and publications, and reach. In preparation for the second funding cycle, LAEF worked with WolfBrown, a consulting firm that assists cultural organizations with expertise in market research, program design, and evaluation, to strengthen and expand its data collection effort. WolfBrown then analyzed the data collected and produced, in partnership with LAEF, a first-of-its-kind report on the nonprofit literary arts field.\n\nDownload the 2022 Literary Arts Emergency Fund Impact Report.\n\n(Credit: 2022 Literary Arts Emergency Fund Impact Report, Literary Arts Emergency Fund, established and administered by Academy of American Poets, Community of Literary Magazine & Presses, and National Book Foundation.)\n\nWatch an Information Session Hosted by the Literary Arts Emergency Fund About the Report.\n\nThe report, which focuses on data collected from the 410 literary organizations and publishers that applied to the fund in 2021, offers a detailed and compelling look at the tremendous cultural impact of nonprofit literary organizations and publishers and, at the same time, the financial precarity they face.\n\nWhile “literary culture” often brings to mind commercial publishing, bookstores, and libraries, the report demonstrates the unique contributions that nonprofit literary organizations and publishers make to literature and the larger arts and culture sector in the US. For example, in 2021 alone these organizations and publishers reached 220.3 million individuals through programs and publications; provided $22 million to writers; and employed 2,546 individuals, many of whom are writers.\n\nThe report also reveals that nonprofit literary arts organizations and publishers, to a large extent, exist with meager budgets, few staff, and little or no cash reserves. This is especially true for nonprofit publishers and those organizations that are led by BIPOC staff and serve historically underrepresented groups.\n\nFor additional information about funding challenges faced by the literary arts field, in 2021, Inside Philanthropy (independent and distinct from LAEF) produced the report “Giving for Writing & Literature” (behind a paywall), which notes that, “Philanthropic giving for writing and literature is minuscule relative to other artistic disciplines.”\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Literary Arts Emergency Fund awarded one-time, unrestricted emergency grants from $5,000 to $50,000. Grant amounts were determined by the following factors: financial need and projected loss due to COVID-19; budget size; diversity, equity, and inclusion as it relates to an organization’s staff and board; poets and writers contracted with; audiences served; geographic location; and an organization’s ability to continue offering programming.\n\nEligible applicants included:\n\nLiterary arts organizations and publishers* AND\n\nIncorporated nonprofits with 501(c)3 status OR a fiscal agent AND\n\nBased in the United States, U.S. territories, or Tribal lands\n\n*Because financial losses experienced by nonprofit literary arts organizations and publishers were substantial and emergency relief was limited, libraries, museums, book arts organizations, humanities councils, centers for the book, residencies, playwriting organizations, author’s homes, and organizations devoted to championing the legacy of an individual writer were ineligible.\n\nDecisions about the eligibility of applications as determined by the three managing organizations were final.\n\nApplications were reviewed by independent panelists who were named on the three managing organizations’ websites. Panel ratings formed the basis for funding. Award decisions were approved and finalized by members of the Board of Directors of the three managing organizations.\n\nFunding through the Literary Arts Emergency Fund has closed. All applicant organizations from the most recent round were notified whether or not they received funding via Submittable on Monday, April 11, 2022.\n\nThe Literary Arts Emergency Fund is made possible the Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe Emmy-nominated producer and activist will be the master of ceremonies for the 2022 National Book Awards\n\nThe National Book Foundation, presenter of the National Book Awards, announced Padma Lakshmi, award-winning television host and New York Times bestselling author, will host the 73rd National Book Awards on November 16, 2022.\n\n“The National Book Awards Ceremony is the highlight of our work each year celebrating exceptional literature,” said Ruth Dickey, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. “We are honored that Padma Lakshmi will bring her passion for books, storytellers, and human connection to this year’s in-person Benefit Dinner.”\n\nLakshmi is the creator, host, and executive producer of the critically acclaimed Hulu series Taste the Nation; host and executive producer of Top Chef; bestselling author of multiple cookbooks, a memoir, and a children’s book; the co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America; and an advocate for immigrants’ rights, women’s rights, and food justice.\n\nOn November 16, Lakshmi will serve as master of ceremonies for the National Book Awards Ceremony, where the Winners in the categories of Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Translated Literature, and Young People’s Literature will be announced.

Art Spiegelman will be recognized with the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, presented by Neil Gaiman, and Tracie D.
