The BBC SSO plays with spirit and finesse for their Associate Conductor.\n\nAntonín Dvořák: Piano Trio No 3\n\nShaham Wallfisch Erez trio\n\nNimbus Records NI5952\n\nRelease: 2 June 2023\n\nAntonín Dvořák (1841-1904) was a prolific and versatile composer who made richly diverse contributions to practically every genre of classical music. As a violist and keyboard player, he had a particular affinity with chamber music composition. Some of his chamber outputs held significance at crucial milestones in his career, as the items on this disc clearly corroborate. Dvořák began to compose his Sonatina Op.100 in 1893 and completed it the same year, dedicating it ‘to my children’ after taking into consideration his 15 year old daughters piano playing abilities, and 10 year olds sons violin. It was ‘intended for young people…but grown-ups, too, may not be unwilling to amuse themselves with it.’\n\nElgar Oratorios 6CD Set - The Dream of Gerontius, The Apostles, The Kingdom\n\nHallé Orchestra / Mark Elder\n\nHallé CDHLD7561 (6 CDs)\n\nRelease: 2 June 2023\n\nMark Elder has long been hailed for his interpretation of the works of Sir Edward Elgar. This special release box set celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the Hallé label and marks Hallé’s Elgar oratorios festival at the Bridgewater Hall in June 2023. This box set brings together Elgar’s three major oratorios. The multiple award-winning recordings feature the highly acclaimed Hallé Chorus and Youth Choir as well as vocalists, Alice Coote, Paul Groves, Bryn Terfel, Rebecca Evans, Jacques Imbrailo, David Kempster, Brindley Sherratt, Claire Rutter, Susan Bickley, John Hudson and Iain Paterson.\n\nRameau Re-Imagined\n\nEdward Higginbottom, organ; Holly Teague, soprano; Felix Higginbottom, percussion\n\nCRD Records CRD3543\n\nRelease: 2 June 2023\n\nThis programme is the Re-imagining of Rameau as Organist: not removing any works from the harpsichord repertory, but allowing some of them, arguably the more theatrical, to take on a new life and identity as organ music. The works in this collection have been taken mainly from Rameau’s two major harpsichord collections – Pieces de clavecin 1724 and Nouvelles suites de pieces de clavecin 1729/30.\n\n26 MAY 2023\n\nCésar Franck: Piano Trio & Quintet, Violin Sonata - Louis Vierne: Piano Quintet\n\nTrio Wanderer, Catherine Montier & Christophe Gaugué\n\nharmonia mundi HMM902318.19 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nThe Trio Wanderer follows up its multi-award-winning Schumann set with an exploration of the fascinating world of César Franck. The gulf between his youthful trios and the prodigious works of his maturity reveals a fundamental turning point in the history of French chamber music. Continuing along the trail that Franck blazed with such brio, Louis Vierne’s deeply moving Quintet offers an echo of the older man’s work.\n\nMen and Angels - 21st Century Choral Works\n\nThe Ramsey Singers / Mark Fenton\n\nUlysses Arts UA 230020\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nFirst recordings of contemporary choral works by Philip Stopford, Kerena Briggs, James Lavino, Lucy Walker, Alec Roth, Ben Ponniah, Jeremy Woodside, Sarah MacDonald and Jonathan Rathbone\n\nDaigo Hanada: Journey Through Memories\n\nUMG Japan\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nJourney Through Memories is a recollection of Daigo's life. When he first played piano as a child, he was stunned by its volume. He found the muffler felt attached to the piano and fell in love with the warm sound that enveloped his anxious heart, which established his current musical style.\n\nBecause\n\nReginald Mobley, countertenor; Baptiste Trotignon, piano\n\nAlpha Classics ALPHA936\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nDuring the long era when Bach, Mozart and Beethoven were creating the musical canon of Western Europe, the songs of African slaves resounded in the colonies on the other side of the Atlantic, expressing pain and longing, but also joy and the desire for freedom. As the origin of many musical forms associated with the United States of America, including jazz, gospel, blues, soul, funk, indeed all Afro-American music, the repertoire of 'Spirituals'\n\nare true hymns to resilience, whose beauty and strength of both lyrics and music symbolise hope and faith in humanity. This project’s aim is to do justice to this musical heritage and to honour its past performers. The American countertenor Reginald Mobley, a rising figure in baroque music, notably under the direction of John Eliot Gardiner, and the French pianist Baptiste Trotignon, winner of numerous awards (Victoires du Jazz, Django d'Or) have combined their talents and sensibilities to celebrate these spirituals and the\n\nmusic of Black composers and poets in a programme entitled \"Because\". A gathering of songs arranged or written by composers including H T Burleigh and Florence Price, most often\n\nre-composed with great freedom by the two performers. Very evocative traditional melodies (such as \"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\", \"Deep river\" and other anonymous \"gospel songs\") are mixed with the improvised piano, in an interactive and organic way.\n\nIsata Kanneh-Mason: Childhood Tales - Mozart, Dohnányi, Debussy, Schumann\n\nIsata Kanneh-Mason, piano; Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nContinuing her developing legacy with Decca Classics that began in 2019, Isata Kanneh-Mason’s third album album uses Dolby Atmos Technology to capture Isata’s signature virtuosic flair. The eldest of the famous musical siblings, Isata’s first memory of playing the piano was as a five-year-old on holiday in the Caribbean and sitting in front of her grandparents’ instrument. With a reputation for inventive programs, expressive performance, and accomplished technique, Isata is in increasing demand nationally and internationally, and was the only classical artist to appear in TIDAL’s 2023 Rising Artists to Watch. Isata evokes the magic of childhood in this charming collection of nostalgic music. The album is centered around Ernő Dohnányi’s rarely performed Variations on a Nursery Song, expanding the well-known Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star into a truly virtuosic work which takes the theme through eleven musical variations and a fugal finale. Subtitled “for the enjoyment of friends of humor, to the annoyance of others”, it saw great success when it was introduced in the U.K. in the 1910s, with its witty, kaleidoscopic mix making this a concert favorite for many years afterwards before falling out of fashion – it was subsequently performed almost every year at the Proms from 1920s to 1950s. Isata is joined by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with whom she previously recorded Clara Schumann’s Piano Concerto for her 2019 album Romance on Decca. From a young age, Isata has had a special affinity with Mozart and recalls playing the composer’s Variations on the French song, “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman,” with the same recognizable melody transformed through twelve sophisticated and inventive variations. Composed by Mozart when he was around Isata’s age, it is the perfect showpiece to pair with the Dohnányi.\n\nIkarus Among the Stars - Music of Debra Kaye\n\nVarious performers\n\nNavona Records NV6521\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nThere are many composers who intertwine eclectic influences into one coherent picture, but few people do it as ambitiously and convincingly as New York City based composer Debra Kaye. On Ikarus Among the Stars, she vibrantly explores themes both real and surreal, perpetual and fleeting, nonchalant, and profound. Kaye's sources of inspiration are unnumbered; it seems there is nothing which she cannot turn into a composition. The works presented (two of them multiple award winners) draw their inspiration from Spanish poetry, real-life tragedy, and from the pieces of fellow contemporary composers. All of these sources are woven together by Kaye's measured choice of tonality, and the resulting tapestry is remarkable.\n\nAdolphe Adam: Orfa - Romantic Ballet in Two Acts\n\nKalina Hristova, Vesela Trichkova, Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra / Dario Salvi\n\nNaxos 8.574478\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nOrfa was Adolphe Adam’s penultimate ballet, with an intriguing scenario based on Nordic mythology. It shares analogies with Hesiod’s Theogony and Wagner’s Ring cycle in depicting the struggle between the older gods (Loki) and younger gods (Odin). Full of archetypal Romantic elements, Orfa was mounted with the lavish stage spectacle for which the Paris Opera was famous, and featured Fanny Cerrito in the title role. Adam’s writing shows increasingly vivid orchestral imagination, drama and tonal colour, with roles for several instrumental soloists. This first recording uses a new edition copied from Adam’s original manuscript score held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n\nJose Antônio de Almeida Prado: Sinfonia dos Orixás; Pequenos funerais cantantes\n\nClarissa Cabral, Sabah Teixeira, Sao Paulo Symphony Choir, Sao Paulo Symphony Orchestra , Neil Thomson\n\nNaxos 8.574411\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nJose Antônio de Almeida Prado was one of the most admired Brazilian composers of his time. The two stylistically diverse works featured on this album exemplify different creative periods in the composer’s life. The prize-winning Pequenos funerais cantantes, which was Almeida Prado’s breakthrough as a composer, is a lament full of unique soundworlds forged from different combinations of choral and orchestral writing. The superbly orchestrated Sinfonia dos OrixAs takes as its subject the Orishas (deities in the Yoruba religion) – and is a personal tribute to the rich Afro-Brazilian religious traditions, a sumptuous melodic and rhythmic feast celebrating the forces of nature.\n\nLigeti: Études; Capriccios\n\nHan Chen, piano\n\nNaxos 8.574397\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nLigeti’s etudes redefined the piano’s tonal possibilities and are considered one of his major creative achievements, as well as being one of the most significant sets of piano studies of the 20th century. They inevitably draw on influences from the past such as Chopin and Debussy, but avoid any sense of eclecticism. Ligeti’s often spectacularly virtuoso use of complex rhythms and geometric patterns proceeds from simple core ideas to create music that is ‘neither “avant-garde” nor “traditional”, neither tonal nor atonal’, and always backed by that glint of humour in the composer’s eye.\n\nImre Szechenyi: Dances for Piano; Serenade in A minor\n\nGyorgy Lazar, piano; Istvan Kassai, piano\n\nNaxos 8.574506\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nImre Szechenyi was a distinguished diplomat who rose to become the Austro-Hungarian ambassador to Berlin, retaining the friendship and admiration of a gallery of leading figures of the age: Liszt, Johann Strauss II, Suppe, Waldteufel, Bismarck, and many others. He was also a pianist and composer, and his diplomatic career ran parallel to his musical life. Szechenyi’s metier was the dance, and his series of polkas, mazurkas and serenades – infectiously engaging and ardently lyrical – were popular pieces in their day but are now little known. orchestrations of many of these dances were made by the composer but five that were never scored for orchestra are included here.\n\nKorean Tapestry – Korean Art Songs by Leading Korean Women Composers\n\nKyoung Cho, soprano; Won Cho, bass; Eun-Hee Park, piano\n\nNaxos 8.579129\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nA love for vocal music has maintained its presence throughout Korea’s turbulent history, and Ga-Gok or ‘Art Song’ has long offered opportunities to convey personal sentiments and messages through lyrical settings of the nation’s poetry. Today’s often deeply expressive Korean art songs uniquely combine traditional Korean/Asian musical elements within the structure of Western music. They feature the finest examples of solo and duet songs by leading Korean female composers, thus providing new insights into Korean society and its modern musical culture.\n\nGreat Composers in Words and Music: Tchaikovsky\n\nLucy Scott, Davinia Caddy\n\nNaxos 8.578369\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nThe Great Composers in Words and Music series consists of mini-biographies read by acclaimed actors and illustrated with musical excerpts. The biographies are full of fascinating detail and anecdote, and have been written in a highly approachable style by Davinia Caddy. Is there any music more instantly recognisable and beautifully scored than Tchaikovsky’s wildly popular ballet Swan Lake? These and other works have become enduring classics, yet they were not uncontroversial in Tchaikovsky’s day, and there are those that still wonder if his style is fundamentally European or ardently Russian. Find out more about Tchaikovsky’s childhood obsession with music, his turbulent relationships with friends and colleagues, and how he overcame the deepest of personal crises to transcend all with a creative ambition that has left us with some of the greatest music ever written. The narrative is illustrated with musical excerpts from Piano Concerto No. 1, Symphonies Nos. 4 and 6, the 1812 Overture, The Nutcracker, Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty, among others.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven: Piano Concerto Nos 2 & 3\n\nFriedrich Wuhrer, piano; Pro Musica Orchestra Stuttgart / Walther Davisson\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3003CD\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nViennese pianist Friedrich Wuhrer studied piano with Franz Schmidt and composition with Joseph Marx. Admired by Pfitzner and Reger, who dedicated works to him, Wuhrer had a strong interest in contemporary composers but on disc his major recordings include the first nominally complete cycle of Schubert's piano sonatas and the Beethoven piano concertos. These recordings of Piano Concertos Nos. 2 and 3 were taped in Stuttgart with conductor Walther Davisson, a distinguished erstwhile violinist, and originally released in 1956. A few years later, during London concerts, a critic wrote of Wuhrer’s ‘magnificent playing in Beethoven using a tremendous range of dynamics and completely without resort to special effects’, qualities that apply equally to these classic Vox recordings.\n\nRITMO - The Chick Corea Symphony Tribute\n\nADDA Simfònica, Josep Vicent, Emilio Solla\n\nWarner Classics / Erato\n\nRelease: 26 May 2023\n\nConceived and produced by ADDA Symphony Orchestra’s Music Director Josep Vincent, RITMO is a celebration of Chick Corea’s music and its tremendous influence in contemporary Jazz and its fusion with Latin music. The programme features performances from five-time Grammy Award-winning saxophonist Paquito D’Rivera and flamenco singer and saxophonist Antonio Lizana, with arrangements by Latin Grammy Award-winning pianist-composer Emilio Solla.\n\n19 MAY 2023\n\nThe Bevan Family Consort - Vidi Speciosam - Sacred Choral Music\n\nSignum SIGCD746\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nConducted by Graham Ross, this is a collection of choral masterpieces recorded by the Bevan Family Consort. The ensemble includes sister-sopranos Mary and Sophie Bevan and others from the second generation of cousins of the Bevan Family Choir, who released their first recording in 1975. This album is dedicated to former Choir conductor David Bevan, who died in 2021, and consists of music that was introduced to members of the Consort by him. It is a celebration of his memory and legacy amid this special family of musicians.\n\nWinged Dreams - Live Sessions\n\nAbilene\n\nSignum SIGCD748\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nAbilene is a group of musicians whose compositions pair classical and contemporary elements to tell a story. Shaped by the influence of great composers, authors and spirited conversation, their artistry is driven by the belief that music should elevate the soul.\n\nKate Gentile: b i o m e i.i\n\nMembers of International Contemporary Ensemble\n\nObliquity Records\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nDrummer and composer Kate Gentile releases b i o m e i.i, a new album featuring members of International Contemporary Ensemble with the composer on drums and percussion on new label Obliquity Records. The album consists of one 13-movement piece for seven musicians showcasing Gentile’s richly detailed and imaginative composing, with improvisation woven throughout. The piece was commissioned by International Contemporary Ensemble and first performed on 26 May 2022 at Roulette Intermedium in Brooklyn, NY. \"There's a kind of Conway Game of Life thing going on in Kate's music,” said pianist Cory Smythe, “one clear, imaginative, precise idea set into just the right relationship with another, and an extraordinary ecosystem of writhing musical forms comes to life. It seems like an impossible feat to get right even once, and yet part of the dizzying, dazzling brilliance of b i o m e i.i is that Kate achieves it over and over again, and with Darwinian abundance. For me, performing on this project was like transforming into a series of pulsing organs, shuffling limb-parts. Somehow Kate managed to turn the International Contemporary Ensemble into a menagerie of oozing, skittering, flapping sonic symbionts.” In creating a sound that was both abstract and alien, Gentile began with making titles based purely on alphabetical preferences; invented words that were sonically and visually pleasing. After the music was composed, the internal logic of the music inspired a backstory of invented meaning for the titles. The liner notes for b i o m e i.i include a glossary of terms, accompanied by drawings and diagrams. Many definitions refer to other definitions, creating a reference web reflecting the musical connections between tracks while painting a picture of a biome on an alien moon. Gentile said, “This music absolutely did not need any non-music subject matter attached to it, but I welcomed the extra layer.” Gentile cites the magical qualities of Bernard Parmegiani, Ikue Mori, and Ches Smith’s Congs for Brums as some of the influences for the album. “Ultimately, with this album, I’m just luxuriating in many things I like,” Gentile said, “harmonies and rhythms that are pleasing to me, tactile sonic textures, invented alien worlds, weird semi-psychedelic visual art...it’s music that I want to really ‘live in’ for a while.”\n\nIan Venables and Ralph Vaughan Williams: Portraits of a Mind\n\nAlessandro Fisher, tenor; William Vann, piano; The Navarra Quartet\n\nAlbion Records ALBCD057\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\n2022 marked Vaughan Williams’s 150th birthday, for which The Ralph Vaughan Williams Society commissioned a new work from Ian Venables, one of Britain’s most distinguished composers and a master of song composition. He has created a song cycle, Portraits of a Mind, using the same forces (tenor, piano and string quartet) as those specified for Vaughan Williams’s song cycle On Wenlock Edge. The work paints a series of five portraits of Vaughan Williams by setting poets associated with him: George Meredith (The Lark Ascending, of course); Ursula Vaughan Williams; Robert Louis Stevenson; Christina Rossetti; and Walt Whitman. On Wenlock Edge is the ideal companion for this recording – but we knew that Vaughan Williams’s Four Hymns were also arranged for tenor, piano and string quartet in 1925, and performed by Steuart Wilson and others. That score is lost, so we commissioned Iain Farrington to create a modern replacement.\n\nLiya Petrova - Momentum 1 : Walton, Respighi\n\nLiya Petrova, violin; Royal Philharmonic Orchestra / Duncan Ward; Adam Laloum, piano\n\nMirare MIR670\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nBulgarian-born violinist Liya Petrova joined the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Duncan Ward last September to record the first of two albums - this one, with the Walton concerto, and the second featuring the Korngold concerto which will be released in 2024 (alongside a live performance with the RPO). This CD also features Respighi's Violin Sonata in B minor, P 110.\n\nReminiscence\n\nSimon Bürki, piano\n\nAparté AP317\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nAparté is proud to release the debut album of Swiss pianist Simon Bürki. Born in 2000, Bürki has won many international competitions and is currently studying at the Juilliard School with Sergei Babayan. His debut recording features works by Rachmaninov – 2023 marks the 150th anniversary of the composer’s birth – and Scriabin, Tchaikovsky, Liszt and Schumann.\n\nRise Up – Luca Brugnoli - A Voice to be Heard\n\nLuca Brugnoli, Alice Platten, The Hennessey Brown Music Collective, Robert Lewis\n\nConvivium Records CR084\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nAt just 9 years of age Luca had already toured the world with Libera Boys Choir. A featured soloist on Aled Jones' track Vespera and Kurt Bestors' Ave Maria, he has also been invited to perform at many charity events. In 2022 Luca was Runner Up in BBC Young Chorister of The Year. He has a large following on social media and high praise from industry professionals including Katherine Jenkins, who claimed he \"has a God-given voice\". This debut album directed by Robert Lewis with The Hennessey Brown Music Collective includes many fresh arrangements of Luca’s favourite music.\n\nSaverio Mercadante: Messa Solenne for soloists, male chorus and orchestra\n\nFrancesco Meli, Matteo Lippi, Mario Cassi, Nicola Ulivieri, Francesco Biraga, Giovanni Battista Fabris, Francesco Aliberti, Orchestra e Coro dell’Opera Carlo Felice Genova / Fabrizio Callai\n\nDynamic CDS7986\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nIn the last decade, research in the Genoa archives has revealed a series of important manuscripts, one of which is Saverio Mercadante’s Messa solenne. This magnificent score requires four vocal soloists, a male choir – women were then forbidden to sing in church – and a large orchestra with extensive concertante roles for cor anglais and violin. It was premiered in January 1868, two years before Mercadante’s death, and shows the composer’s artistic maturity at its peak: opulent orchestration, extensive counterpoint, intricate instrumental textures, rich lyricism and fugal mastery. This world première recording amplifies the significance of the Genoese musical tradition.\n\nRichard Wagner: Tristan und Isolde – an orchestral passion - Symphonic compilation arranged by Henk de Vlieger\n\nStaatskapelle Weimar / Hansjorg Albrecht\n\nOehms Classics OC1729\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThis new recording from the Staatskapelle Weimar under Hansjorg Albrecht presents a rarely heard compilation of Richard Wagner’s themes from Tristan und Isolde, arranged for orchestra by Henk de Vlieger (b. 1953). This is Hansjorg Albrecht's follow-up Wagner recording to his album Der Ring Ohne Worte (OC1872). The Staatkapelle Weimar dates back to 1491, making it one of the oldest orchestras in the world, and one that is more than familiar with the works of Richard Wagner.\n\nFolk Songs of the British Isles - includes The Last Rose of Summer, Down by the Salley Gardens and The Foggy, Foggy Dew\n\nJanis Kelly, Yvonne Howard, Elaine Delmar, Wynne Evans, Nicky Spence, Mark Llewelyn Evans, Kevin Whately, Fiona Kelly, Jean Kelly, Caroline McCausland, Michael Pollock, John Wilson\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD0668\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nSOMM Recordings is pleased to announce a musical journey around the four nations of the United Kingdom with Folk Songs of the British Isles. Celebrating the “living, breathing heritage of British and Irish folksong down the ages”, the twenty-seven-track recital features soprano Janis Kelly, mezzos Yvonne Howard and Maria Jagusz, tenors Nicky Spence and Wynne Evans, baritone Mark Llewelyn Evans, jazz doyenne Elaine Delmar and actor-singer Kevin Whately. Fiona Kelly (flute), Jean Kelly (harp) and pianists Michael Pollock and John Wilson provide instrumental contributions with singer Caroline McCausland accompanying herself on guitar. Much-loved songs include She Moved Through the Fair, The Last Rose of Summer, The Foggy, Foggy Dew and Down by the Salley Gardens. Local colour is provided by songs such as Blaydon Races, Skye Boat Song, Sosban Fach and The Oak and the Ash while the entirely new Song for Gwyn (words by Christopher Morley, music by John Wilson) tributes Gwyn Williams, former Principal Viola with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, which he joined in 1965 and where he played for conductors Hugo Rignold, Louis Fremaux and Sir Simon Rattle. Royalties will be donated to the Gwyn Williams Bursary Fund which supports young violists at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire.\n\nEvery Living Creature - choral music by Kenneth Leighton\n\nLondinium, Rebecca Lea, Nina Bennet, Ciara Hendrick, Nick Pritchard, Finchley Children’s Music Group, Andrew Griffiths, Grace Rossiter\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD0667\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nSOMM Recordings is delighted to announce the label return of the chamber choir Londinium and director Andrew Griffiths wi th Every Living Creature, a recital of choral music by Kenneth Leighton on the 35th anniversary of his death featuring five premiere recordings. The album unearths a number of significant works by this important British composer, including the extraordinary, eight-movement Laudes Animantium, a 25-minute work for double choir, soloists and children’s chorus, as well as a superb setting of John Donne’s Nativitie and the charming Three Carols (1948). Also featured are the partsong London Town and three more sacred works: Lord, When the Sense of Thy Sweet Grace, An evening hymn and A Hymn to the Trinity. Five of the pieces are heard on disc for the first time; the remaining four have been recorded only once before. Londinium is joined by soloists Rebecca Lea and Nina Bennet (sopranos), Ciara Hendrick (mezzo-soprano), Nick Pritchard (tenor) and, in the finale of Laudes Animantium, the choir of Finchley Children’s Music Group. In his insightful booklet notes, Griffiths writes: “It is rare to find a choral singer who does not enjoy performing Leighton’s works. His music is rooted in rigorous part-writing and counterpoint, and alive with invigorating rhythm, motivic interplay and piquant dissonance, underlaid with a deeply lyrical instinct and an exquisite sensitivity to the meaning and colour of text”.\n\nScarlatti, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann\n\nZhu Xiao-Mei, piano\n\nAccentus Music ACC80580 (5 CDs)\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nZhu Xiao-Mei has taken an important place in the classical music world, not least in view of her valuable interpretations of Johann Sebastian Bach's music. This CD box set combines key works for pianist composed by Scarlatti, Haydn and Mozart as well as Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann. These recordings attest to her ability to express a wide range of styles and epochs through her unique artistic vision and tonal sensitivity. Recorded between 1995 and 2011, they are the result of an intense exploration of the different characters of the six composers and are indicative of their interpreter's Œuvre.\n\nEudice Shapiro - Brahms, Bloch, Bartok and Stravinsky\n\nEudice Shapiro, violin; Brooks Smith, Ralph Berkowitz, Paul Weston Orchestra / Paul Weston\n\nBiddulph Recordings 85026-2 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThis 2-CD set features solo recordings by the remarkable American violinist Eudice Shapiro. Shapiro attended the Curtis Institute of Music, and was the only female student in Efrem Zimbalist’s class. After graduating in 1936, she moved to Los Angeles, where she was a highly sought-after free-lance violinist, playing as leader in recording sessions of Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee and Pat Boone. In addition to performing as soloist, Shapiro was the leader of the American Art Quartet. She also served as the concertmistress of the RKO and Paramount film studios, and can be heard in such films as For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Apartment, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and Around the World in 80 Days. As the noted critic Henry Roth remarked through the medium of the cinema, “her recorded playing in solo passages has been heard by an audience far greater than any other woman in history.” The recordings featured in this 2-CD set include the complete Brahms violin sonatas, works by Bloch, Bartok, Milhaud and Ravel, as well as two Stravinsky pieces sanctioned by the composer himself.\n\nAlexander Scriabin: Visionary and Poet\n\nDaniela Roma, piano\n\nDynamic CDS7984\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThe enigmatic Alexander Scriabin, mystic and herald of new music, was taught composition by Arensky and Taneyev and piano by Safonov. His earliest works, presented on this album, belong to a stage of development much influenced by Chopin and Liszt. The Preludes, Op. 13, whether ` or playful, contain explicit references to Chopin but also moments of visionary originality that presage his future modernity. Complex harmony can be heard in the famous etude in C sharp minor, while the epic ardour of the Fantasie in B minor is another indication of the staggering advances to come.\n\nAlvin Lucier: Swing Bridge; Sizzles\n\nAustin Buckett, Australian Art Orchestra\n\nMode Records MOD-CD-312\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThis release brings together two works by Alvin Lucier centered on the pipe organ, a perfect instrument for Lucier’s compositional practice. Both are first recordings. “Swing Bridge” was commissioned by this record’s ensemble, the Australian Art Orchestra, for the Melbourne Town Hall Grand Organ. The score requires that specific pipes be removed from the organ and run into three specially constructed offset chests, each accommodating two pipes (six pitches total). These pipes are manipulated by three or more performers, known as ‘pipe wavers.’ The organ and pipe wavers are accompanied by the ensemble who create long tones microtonally associated to the organ. For “Sizzles” the composer writes: “Drums of various sizes are randomly placed throughout the performance space. Fine materials such as lentils, chickpeas, and candy hearts are sprinkled on the drumheads. As low organ tones are sounded, the skins of the drums vibrate sympathetically, causing the drums to sound and the material to move. Each drum is individually amplified with a contact or air microphone and a separate amplifier.”\n\nGerard Pape: Heliophonie - Electroacoustic Works, Vol 1\n\nGerard Pape\n\nMode Records MOD-CD-338\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThis release gathers two electroacoustic works by Gerard Pape. Dedicated to the late composer Ana-Maria Avram, Vers la lumière II (2017) is an electroacoustic meditation on the afterlife as a kind of continually evolving sonic universe within which the spirit floats freely, carried along in the arms of the sound itself. Pape weaves a slowly evolving lullaby made of complex and ethereal timbral utterances. Each cry seems to stretch out into eternity, the extremely long release of each sound seems to reach toward a future that never arrives. The sound material is derived entirely from samples of a Waterphone, a remarkable instrument invented in the 1960s by american artist Richard Waters. The instrument functions on the principle of a steel resonator containing a small amount of water which is surrounded by a series of various sized bronze rods which can be struck or bowed, creating an arrangement of overtones. Commissioned to mark the occasion of the total solar eclipse on 29 March 2006, Heliophonie follows a strict temporal structure that is inspired by studies in astrophysies describing the various stages of the evolution of the sun. Both works are first recordings.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi: Messa da Requiem\n\nLeipziger Universitatschor, Mendelssohnorchester Leipzig, Viktorija Kaminskaite, Marie Henriette Reinhold, Andre Khamasmie, Wolf Matthias Friedrich, David Timm\n\nRondeau Productions ROP6196\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThe mantra of historical performance practice has long since prevailed in classical music. Hardly any listener is left amazed by the sound of the harpsichord in Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier or the bright cornetts in Monteverdi’s works. When it comes to Giuseppe Verdi’s works, this aspect is relatively new since, by the end of the 19th century, the modern orchestra had supposedly become firmly established. With the Mendelssohn Orchestra, which specializes in historical performance practice, David Timm has an ensemble at his disposal that can recreate the timbres intended by the composer down to the last detail. Therefore, this recording of the Requiem is particularly captivating due to the mixture of youthful choral voices, great vocal soloists and an instrumentation as Verdi had in mind.\n\nJacob van Eyck: Der Fluyten Lust-hof\n\nSimon Borutzki, recorders\n\nRondeau Productions Klanglogo KL154748-7 (7 CDs)\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThe Fluyten Lust-hof is the most extensive collection of pieces for a wind instrument ever created. During the period of transition from the Renaissance to the Baroque, the bell expert and recorder virtuoso, Jacob van Eyck, blind from birth, dictated his approximately 150 diminutions of well-known church and folk melodies in order that they could be published. With this monumental complete recording, Simon Borutzki, with 26 recorders, presents a multi-layered universe of sound: from the deep, rich voices of the low tenor recorders to the twinkling, effervescent virtuosity of the Sopranino. Evergreens such as 'Amarilli mia bella', 'Flow my tears' and 'Questa dolce sirena' are found alongside free preludes, an echo fantasy, the 'Batali' battle scene, and the chirruping English nightingale.\n\nRoland Moser: Violoncello solo e in duo\n\nKathi Gohl Moser, Anton Kernjak, Helena Winkelman, Conrad Steinmann, Matthias Arter\n\nSolo Musica SM429\n\nRelease: 19 May 2023\n\nThe CD includes Moser's most important works for violoncello with and without accompaniment. Moser - one of the most renowned Swiss composers - explores new tonal systems and the dialogue between sound and language with a never-ending spirit of research. Almost like a sound-sealing alchemist, he develops new playing techniques that reveal astonishing sound phenomena. Thomas Meyer on the CD: \"When was the last time I heard such intimate music! The loving togetherness is, as it were, the prerequisite for most of the pieces on this CD, for the composer is composing here for the cellist with whom he has long shared life (...), for Kathi Gohl Moser.\" Roman Brotbeck on Moser: \"... Moser (...) pays attention to clarity. Better to say too little than too much, better to remain precise in the little than to become diffuse with too much information. However, this has nothing to do with new simplicity. What is clear and few, precisely because it is understood, very quickly becomes very complex.” Heinz Holliger: \"Great music, insanely well played.\"\n\n12 MAY 2023\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach: The Complete Works for Keyboard, Vol 8: Köthen, 1717-1723 - For Maria Barbara\n\nBenjamin Alard, harpsichord, clavichord\n\nharmonia mundi HMM902469.71 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nEagerly pursuing his exploration of Bach’s corpus for solo keyboard, Benjamin Alard focuses here on works associated with the composer’s first wife, Maria Barbara, and her untimely death in 1720. This instalment includes both the Inventions and Sinfonias, a collection of teaching pieces brimming with freshness and invention, and the prodigious French Suites, one of the peaks of Bach’s years in Cöthen.\n\nNielsen: Violin Concerto; Symphony No 4\n\nJames Ehnes, violin; Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra / Edward Gardner\n\nChandos CHSA 5311 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nNielsen’s epic Violin Concerto was premiered in Copenhagen in February 1912, by violinist Peder Moller. Nominally the work is set in two movements; both open with a slow section and move to a faster one. Whilst unusual, this could be seen as a more usual fast – slow – fast three movement form, but with an extensive slow introduction to the first movement. The music moves quickly from one idea to the next, and overall has a bold, playful and optimistic feel. In stark contrast, although written only a few years later, the fourth symphony is more cohesive and unified as a work. Written against the background of the first world war, the work is a celebration of life itself. Just before the premier in 1916, Nielsen described it as: ‘Music is Life, and, like it, inextinguishable.’ Composed in the usual four movement form, each movement continues from the last without a break. The final movement features two sets of timpani battling each other across the orchestra. The recording was made in Bergen’s Grieghallen, in Surround Sound, and is available as a hybrid SACD and in Spatial Audio.\n\nEchoes\n\nOrchestra of the Swan\n\nSignum SIGCD732\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nFor their third release on Signum, Orchestra of the Swan complete their cycle of mixtape albums. This disc includes works by Bach and Philip Glass arranged by Artistic Director David Le Page. Resident Orchestra at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, The Courtyard Hereford, Warwick Hall and the Stratford Play House, Orchestra of the Swan are one of the most sought-after ensembles in the UK today.\n\nSoundscapes of Restoration - Music, Sonifications and Field Recordings\n\nThe Coastal Futures Conservatory; Matthew Burtner; EcoSono Ensemble\n\nRavello Records RR8090\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nOn the coasts of the Atlantic, sparrows whistle atop the trees, Eastern winds whisper through spartina grasses, and fiddler crabs skitter within their sandy burrows — a great symphony of shorelines soon to be left incomplete. As rising sea levels continue to threaten coastal reefs, shores, and the hundreds of lifeforms inhabiting them, the Coastal Conservatory urges us to consider our efforts of restoration and offers us an avenue for restoring coastal futures, a meditation on the music of the most integral barriers to the ever-pressing Atlantic. Soundscapes of Restoration is both an exploration and a reflection, a listening experience that leaves one changed with the desire to make change further. It is a journey that cannot, and should not, be forgotten.\n\nPavel Chesnokov: Sacred Choral Music\n\nJessica Kinney, Natalie Manning, Tom Butler, St John’s Voices, Cambridge University Chamber Choir, Graham Walker\n\nNaxos 8.574496\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nPavel Chesnokov studied with Taneyev, Ippolitov-Ivanov and Conus in Moscow and was an admired choral director in the city. He wrote more than 500 choral works, the majority of them sacred. His contribution to music for the Divine Liturgy was immense and he wrote two settings of the All-Night Vigil, the second of which is heard here, rich in chant melodies, and full of grandeur and Romantic lyricism. His smaller-scale works show a refined and perceptive use of texture and sonority, often capturing the essence of chant without direct quotation.\n\nJohn Corigliano: Complete Solo Piano Music\n\nPhilip Edward Fischer, piano; Albany Symphony / David Alan Miller\n\nNaxos 8.559930\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nJohn Corigliano’s music has been commissioned, performed, and recorded by some of the most prominent orchestras, soloists, and chamber musicians in the world. He is the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, five GRAMMY Awards, the Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition, and an Oscar. The Piano Concerto ranges in expression between lyricism and atonality and is extremely virtuosic and theatrical, while the competition piece Fantasia on an Ostinato investigates the performer’s imagination and musicality through minimalist techniques. The devilish discipline of etude Fantasy contrasts with the improvisatory origins of Winging It, while Prelude for Paul echoes the soul of Rachmaninov.\n\nCarl Czerny: Piano Concertinos\n\nRosemary Tuck, piano; English Chamber Orchestra / Richard Bonynge\n\nNaxos 8.574458\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nCarl Czerny found fame and fortune in 19th-century Vienna by writing fashionable and popular works as well as developing techniques for the newly emerging piano with his numerous etudes. Much of Czerny’s concert music for piano was considered ‘wild and almost unplayable’ in his day, but these world premiere recordings reveal inspired melodic writing, great skill in orchestration and colourful virtuoso challenges in a programme that includes his final Concertino, Op 650.\n\nHaydn: Piano Trios Nos 5, 6, 7 and 13, Vol 8\n\nAquinas Piano Trio\n\nNaxos 8.574391\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nAs one of the most celebrated composers of the late 18th century, Joseph Haydn can lay claim to being ‘father of the piano trio’ alongside that of other genres established in his lifetime such as the symphony and the string quartet. The delightful Divertimento in C major is a youthful work, but the later piano trios recorded here take on a heightened sophistication. Strings and keyboard are given a new independence of character in exquisitely crafted works such as the C minor Trio, with its ‘numerous and sometimes spectacular modulations’, and oscillating enharmonic key changes that foreshadow Schubert can be heard in the Trio in D.\n\nReginald Smith Brindle: Complete Works for Solo Guitar, 1 – El Polifemo de oro; Variants; Memento\n\nDuilio Meucci, guitar\n\nNaxos 8.574476\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nAlthough Smith Brindle composed a variety of works including an opera, he is best known for his guitar music. The poetic and lyrical Etruscan Preludes express the mystery of an ancient and lost civilisation, while the enigmatic El Polifemo de oro expresses poet and playwright Federico García Lorca’s attribution of occult powers to the guitar. From the beautifully expressive Nocturne to the extreme effects of Percussion Piece (from Guitarcosmos, Vol. 3 ), the sheer virtuosity of invention in Smith Brindle’s guitar music led Julian Bream to commend his diversity of style and clarity of intention.\n\nTranquillo III\n\nPianoBasso\n\nNaxos Sweden 8.574555\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nPianoBasso is a duo that consists of pianist and arranger Thomas Gustavsson and double bassist Andreas Gustafson. Their goal has from the very beginning been to perform classical music in their personal way, which has meant that they do not always follow the usual norms for this genre. ”I have always liked playing music from the classical piano repertoire, but there has also been a lot of other music that I have wanted to play, but there were no arrangements for the piano. On one occasion I was commissioned to play Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem at a memorial service. The only piano arrangement I found was written by piano equilibrist Franz List, and I thought it felt too bombastic for the occasion. So instead, I made my own arrangement where I focused on cherishing the melody and letting the harmonics get the sorrowful purity that the piece needed. This became the very first seed for PianoBasso.\n\nAnders Lonne Gronseth: Inner View\n\nAnders Lonne Gronseth, extended Multiverse\n\nNXN Recordings NXN2010\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nInner View is the follow up to the exciting Outer View by Anders Lonne Gronseth and Multiverse. Their music is in many ways almost academic, but the immense quality of the musicians and their excellent flow makes this a unique listening experience.\n\nPaul von Klenau: Concertos; Symphony No 8\n\nZiyu He, Soren Rastogi, Singapore Symphony Orchestra / Hans Graf\n\nDacapo 8.224744\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nThis album presents a glimpse of Paul von Klenau’s vast collection of music created during the Second World War when he produced works, almost obsessively, until his passing in 1946. The album includes first recordings of Klenau’s Violin Concerto, Piano Concerto and Symphony No 8, showcasing his mastery of both tonal and atonal sonorities, his distinctive introspective style, and his exceptional talent for venturing into uncharted musical realms.\n\nThe Complete Beethoven Piano Concertos\n\nGarrick Ohlsson, piano; Grand Teton Music Festival Orchestra / Donald Runnicles\n\nReference Recordings FR-751SACD (3 SACDs)\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nReference Recordings is proud to present The Complete Beethoven Piano Concertos played by Grammy-winning Garrick Ohlsson, performing with the Grand Teton Music Festival Orchestra, conducted by Donald Runnicles. This album was recorded during live Festival performances in July 2022. A student of the late Claudio Arrau, Ohlsson is especially noted for his masterly performances of the works of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, as well as the Romantic repertoire. To-date, he is the only American ever to win first prize in the International Chopin Piano Competition. Ohlsson has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning one in 2008 for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without Orchestra) for Beethoven Sonatas, Vol 3. This new recording represents a pinnacle in his career. More than sixty years since its humble beginnings performing in a tent at the base of the Tetons, the Festival is now sought after for both listeners and performers alike as a destination to experience the finest in classical music throughout the summer. The Grand Teton Music Festival Orchestra consists of top talent from across the world, including more than 220 musicians from ninety orchestras and sixty-five institutions of higher learning, many performing together each summer for over twenty-five years. The Festival, founded in 1962, also welcomes yearly some of the most sought-after soloists and visiting artists in classical music today. Under the baton of Runnicles since 2005, these musicians come together to gather inspiration from the mountain setting and to provide spectacular music for Festival audiences. In addition to being Music Director of GTMF, Runnicles is General Music Director of the Deutsche Oper Berlin (DOB) since 2009, and in his final season as Principal Guest Conductor of the Atlanta Symphony since 2001. Runnicles enjoys close and enduring relationships with many of the most significant opera companies and symphony orchestras. His recording of Wagner arias with Jonas Kaufmann and the Orchestra of the Deutsche Oper Berlin won the 2013 Gramophone prize for Best Vocal Recording, and his recording of Janaček’s Jenůfa with the Orchestra and Chorus of the Deutsche Oper Berlin was nominated for a 2016 Grammy award for Best Opera Recording.\n\nFrom Jewish Life\n\nJascha Nemtsov, Wolfgang Meyer, Tabea Zimmermann, Helene Schneidermann, David Geringas, Ingolf Turban\n\nSWR Classic SWR19434CD (5 CDs)\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nIt was apparently Rimsky-Korsakov, himself a member of the “Mighty Handful” of Russian nationalist composers, who encouraged his students at the St. Petersburg Conservatory to go out and collect Jewish folk music and music sung in the synagogues, getting thus the ball rolling for a specific Jewish classical music. The movement led in 1908 to the founding of the St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music and, in 1923, of the Society for Jewish Music in Moscow. The success of the latter and its members was however, short-lived. The antisemitic, anti-cosmopolitan forces that started to brew under the new soviet regime led many potential members of the society to emigrate. The ones that remained were forced to focus on proletarian themes and, even when complying to the requirements, still found themselves often repressed or incarcerated outright. The last notable concert with the society’s music in the Soviet Union took place in Moscow, in April of 1929. Most of this music had then lain dormant for decades until the pianist Jascha Nemtsov (himself the son of a Gulag survivor) and his musical collaborators unearthed it in the last few years of the 20th century. The present collection contains on five discs the recordings – many of them world premieres – realized between 1999 and 2004.\n\nRachmaninov: Suites for Two Pianos & Works for Piano Trio\n\nBarbara Karaskiewicz, Michal Rot, Huberman Piano Trio\n\nDivine Art DDX21101\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nA new album of chamber works by Sergei Rachmaninov. This outstanding recording was made at two venues in Poland: the lodź Academy of Music, and the Czestochowa Philharmony. The principal performer is pianist Barbara Karaskiewicz who has made several highly praised recordings for Divine Art (and before that the esteemed Polish label Acte Preable). She performs two piano duos with her musical partner Michal Rot. The chamber works are played by the Huberman Piano Trio whose Divine Art recording of20th Century Chamber music was also acclaimed by critics. Both the performances and the perfectly engineered recording offer a sumptuous program of Rachmaninov that will delight listeners. The Huberman Trio was formed at the initiative of Barbara Karaskiewicz, named in honour of the great Polish artist Bronislav Huberman, famed for his performances and transcriptions of works by Chopin and others.\n\nJ S Bach: Tranquillity\n\nJonathan Phillips, piano\n\nDivine Art DDX21102\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nLike all great composers, Bach wrote lively dynamic pieces for keyboard as well as in his cantatas etc. But he also produced many wonderful gentle and peaceful works and many of these are collected by pianist Jonathan Phillips in his new album 'Tranquillity'. This CD contains music for anyone hoping to gain an overriding sense of stillness, calm, contemplation and reverence. Bach’s music has radiance, luminosity, divinity, serenity, and timeless beauty. Jonathan has broadcast for the BBC, Russian and Italian and Swedish TV and radio, and given recitals all over the UK, Europe and former Soviet Union. Jonathan was interviewed by John Humphries and played live on Radio Four’s Today programme following a full-page feature article in the Guardian Arts Section about the preparation and performance of the Rachmaninoff 3rd Piano Concerto he gave in London in 2003.\n\nAnthology - Contemporary music for saxophones - Julian Arguëlles, Andy Scott, Graham Ross, Larry Goves, Steve Jackson, Gary Carpenter, Meriel Price\n\nAnthony Brown, Carl Raven, Ben Powell, Larry Goves, Daniel Brew, Grant Russell, Louise Stevens\n\nDivine Art Metier MEX77101\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nDebut recording by virtuoso saxophonist Anthony Brown including seven world première recordings of brand new commissioned works for the saxophone. Each work has its own unique sound world, offering different, exciting new duo and solo works. The performers and composers on this disc represent some of the major influences that have impacted Anthony’s career to date, including teachers, colleagues and friends. These virtuosic works explore the range and characters that the 4 main saxophones (soprano, alto, tenor and baritone) have to offer. The sound world of the contemporary saxophone is explored in great depth, with influences ranging from jazz, film, poetry, electronic music, and theatre. Each work was commissioned especially for this project and has taken 5 years to complete. The disc was recorded between Nov 2021-Jan 2022 at Halle St. Michael’s, Ancoats, by Joe Riser.\n\nPaul Whitty: The Morning\n\n[rout], Icebreaker\n\nDivine Art Metier MEX77113\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nThree new works from composer Paul Whitty written for new music ensembles [rout] and Icebreaker. The Morning includes: 'Nature is a language' – can’t you read? written for Icebreaker - a reorganisation or reconstruction of materials from Michael Gordon’s Yo Shakespeare, a classic of visceral, driving rhythmic patterns from Icebreaker’s repertoire. The reorganisation here is by turns sparsely then densely populated with points of sound and fragments of grit and noise generated by overheard field recordings, that lurch into life then vanish. 'I was bored before I even began' is an exploration of the sounding surfaces of instruments wielded by members of [rout] and each fitted with a contact microphone and routed to guitar pedals. 'The Morning' is a reconstructed, reorganised, reconstituted misreading of Thomas Arne’s Cantata No.5 developed as part of Vauxhall Pleasure, a project developed with Anna Best, and investigating the sonic archaeology of the Vauxhall Cross Gyratory, former site of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens where, for a time, Arne was composer in residence. Paul Whitty is a founder, along with the composers Sam Hayden and Paul Newland, of the ensemble [rout], which has made concert tours in the UK, appearing on BBC Radio 3’s contemporary music programme Hear and Now, on a BMIC Cutting Edge concert tour, at the ICA and at the Huddersfield Festival.\n\nMartha Argerich Live, Vol 14: Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Zurich Recital 1977\n\nMartha Argerich, North German Radio Orchestra, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Moshe Atzmon, Charles Dutoit\n\nDoremi DHR-82034 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nThe eminent Martha Argerich is one of the most loved and admired classical pianists of all time. She quickly gained and maintained world-wide reputation for her exciting performances. This set is the 14th volume of Doremi's special series of live performances and broadcasts featuring the artistry of the young Martha Argerich. Most items are first release ever. These performances are live recordings from her concerts in Hamburg in 1976 and in Geneva in 1973, and from her Zurich Recital of 1977.\n\nIda Presti & Alexandre Lagoya, Vol 2 - Isaac Albeniz, Joaquin Malats, Federico Morenotorroba, Nicolo Paganini, Manuel Maria Ponce, Enrique Granados, Domenico Scarlatti, Matteo Carcassi, Luigi Boccherini, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco\n\nIda Presti, Alexandre Lagoya, Andrew Dawes, Orford Quartet\n\nDoremi DHR-8140 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 12 May 2023\n\nThis exciting new release features the 2nd volume of Doremi's special series dedicated to the legendary guitarists Ida Presti and Alexandre Lagoya. These performances include unreissued solo, duo & chamber recordings made between 1937 and 1969, as well as the live broadcast of 1962 featuring Mario Castelnuovo Tedesco's Concerto for Two Guitars.\n\n5 MAY 2023\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor: Piano Works\n\nLuke Welch, piano\n\nSelf-released\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nA collection of rarely performed solo piano pieces by the famed black British composer, in addition to first recordings.\n\nPierre Sancan: A Musical Tribute\n\nJean-Efflam Bavouzet, piano; Adam Walker, flute; BBC Philharmonic Orchestra / Yan Pascal Tortelier\n\nChandos CHAN 20154\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nPierre Sancan was a tremendously influential figure in French musical life, as a composer, pianist, teacher and conductor, but remains relatively unknown outside France. Born in Mazamet in 1916 - the same year as Dutilleux - he received his early musical training in Morocco and later Toulouse. He entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1934 where he studied with Jean Gallon, conducting with Charles Munch and Roger Desormière, piano with Yves Nat, and composition with Henri Busser. He won the Prix de Rome in 1943, and eventually joined the staff in 1956, teaching there until his retirement in 1985. A list of his piano students reads like a who’s who of French pianists and includes Michel Beroff, Jean-Bernard Pommier, Daniel Varsano, Jacques Rouvier, Jean-Philippe Collard and Jean-Efflam Bavouzet. Yan Pascal Tortelier, whilst not a direct student of Sancan, attended the Paris conservatoire whilst he was in post, and remembers his influence ‘of course though his extraordinary pianistic imagination but even more so by his physical allure and overwhelming personality.’ This programme of the Piano concerto, orchestral works, works for solo piano and the flute Sonatine (played by Adam Walker) serves as a personal tribute to Sancan from both pianist and conductor, and will hopefully help to raise awareness of this gifted composer.\n\nShadow Dances – British Works for Flute\n\nAdam Walker, flute; Huw Watkins, piano\n\nChandos CHAN 20265\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nFor his second album for Chandos, the flute virtuoso Adam Walker explores the music of British composers with pianist Huw Watkins. Vaughan Williams’ Suite de ballet was commissioned by the French flute virtuoso Louis Fleury (who had given the first performance of Debussy’s Syrinx). The work uses eighteenth-century French dance forms, a common practice in ‘neo-classical’ composition. Bax’s Four Pieces rescue music from an abandoned ballet originally conceived for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. Sir Lennox Berkeley’s Sonatina was originally written for treble recorder; James Galway’s championship of the piece made it a staple of the flute repertoire. Howard Fergusson’s Three Sketches were composed intermittently over a period of twenty years. The theme of the third piece is a Hindu melody, ‘Koyaliňya bole ambuvaň’ (Cuckoos sing in the mango tree). Sonatas by York Bowen and William Alwyn complete this varied and engaging programme.\n\nBen Vida: The Beat My Head Hit\n\nBen Vida, vocals, electronics; Nina Dante, vocals; Yarn/Wire\n\nShelter Press SP145\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nComposer Ben Vida and New York-based percussion and piano quartet Yarn/Wire release their album The Beat My Head Hit. Featuring the music and vocals of composer Ben Vida and the vocals of Nina Dante, the five pieces that make up the album were developed with Yarn/Wire over the last four years, deriving from Vida’s 2018 performance for four voices and electronics And So Now at BAM in Brooklyn. The material evolved in the studio during a process that Vida refers to as “creating a meta-voice out of the blending of our four voices”. Russell Greenberg and Laura Barger from Yarn/Wire, along with Vida and Dante, created a sustained presence that became the backbone of the title track - a language that brought the group to a place of breathing in unison. The Beat My Head Hit finds peace in the periphery, a comfort in negative spaces and exhales. There is excitement in subtle harmonies, ambient stillness, restrained melodies, and heightened atmospheres. \"Russell and I started a conversation about having me write something for YarnWire years ago,” Ben Vida said. “There were a number of directions it might have gone, but once we zoned in on me creating a vocal piece where we would all add our voices, that clearly was the path to take. From that point on we went from a composer/ensemble vibe to just kind of being a band. We took our time developing this work and every step of the way the grain became finer and the piece became more mesmerizing.\"\n\nAn Englishman Abroad\n\nLa Serenissima / Adrian Chandler\n\nSignum SIGCD751 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThis disc celebrates the life and work of Italian Baroque composer Nicola Matteis the Younger. Also featured is music by Vivaldi, Purcell, Telemann, Brescianello and Caldara, most of which are world-premiere recordings. La Serenissima are one of the finest classical music ensembles working in the UK. Specialising in Italian Baroque repertoire, they have performed internationally and released a string of critically acclaimed albums since 2003.\n\nPiano Music of Francisco Mignone\n\nMartin Jones, piano\n\nNimbus Records NI8113\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nNimbus is releasing the first in a three-part project of South American Piano Music, with this being 20th century Brazilian music. Each feature the works of composers Francisco Mignone, Radames Gnatalli and Oscar FernAndez, each performed by esteemed Pianist Martin Jones. Although Mignone wrote a large number of pieces for piano solo, his preference had always been for the orchestra, and for solo song. In his works for the piano the search for orchestral colour and texture is clearly evident in his use of ornamentation, spaced chords and explorations at the extreme ends of the keyboard. His focus on piano composition tended to be sporadic, producing many pieces in the 1940s, almost nothing in the 50s and early 60s, and eventually a return to larger forms, in particular the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sonatas. His works for piano solo fall into some natural groupings, four sonatinas and four sonatas, more than thirty waltzes, and the nine Lendas sertanejas. Of the remaining pieces two-thirds are written in a predominantly 19th century European language, and the remainder reflect the influence of Brazilian folklore, in rhythm and form.\n\nSongs of Max Kowalski\n\nSimon Wallfisch, baritone; Camille Butcher, soprano; Edward Ruston, piano\n\nNimbus Records NI8112\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nSongs of Max Kowlaski is a Nimbus Records New release featuring Baritone Simon Wallfisch, Soprano Camille Butcher and Pianist Edward Rushton. Presented here are Songs of Max Kowalski (1882-1956), whose life and career can be described in two main segments: the first in Germany until 1939, and thereafter in England. Kowalski’s output of more than 250 Lieder reflects the tonal and formal aesthetics of the late 19th century. His songs have been performed, premiered and recorded by prominent singers and pianists, and around one third were published by reputable German and Austrian companies. Kowalski’s songs are nearly all in German, yet they represent a wide range of poetic styles, subjects, and periods, as well as cultural, linguistic, and spiritual origins.\n\nBeethoven & Beyond\n\nMaría Dueñas, violin; Wiener Symphoniker / Manfred Honeck\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nFor her Deutsche Grammophon debut, rising star María Dueñas has chosen the Beethoven Violin Concerto, the most musically demanding of all violin concertos, as its centerpiece. Recorded live at Vienna’s prestigious Musikverein, María has composed her own cadenzas for the violin concerto. The album also includes works by Kreisler, Saint-Saëns, Spohr, Wieniawski and Ysaÿe, as well as Beethoven cadenzas by the same composers.\n\nBritten Bruch Violin Concertos\n\nKerson Long, violin; Philharmonia Orchestra / Patrick Hahn\n\nAlpha Classics ALPHA946\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nOn his second album for Alpha Classics, rising star violinist Kerson Leong juxtaposes the Violin Concertos of Benjamin Britten and Max Bruch. This unusual pairing is a reflection on the journey from one extreme of expression to another. Bruch’s In Memoriam is the perfect bridge between them. “The Britten expresses a raw and exposed experience, while the Bruch is comforting and uplifting. After the last few years in which the world has experienced much difficulty and uncertainty due to pandemic, war, and crisis, recording this album in London in January 2022 with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Patrick Hahn was a profoundly cathartic moment. It is in the spirit of catharsis that I offer this album.” - Kerson Leong\n\nDvořák: Symphony No 7; Rhapsody in A minor\n\nMusica Florea / Marek Stryncl\n\nArta F10280\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nMusica Florea conducted by Marek Stryncl began their period instrument series of Dvořák's Symphonies with a two disc set of Symphonies 7 and 8. When stocks ran out this recording vanished from the Arta catalogue. Rather than repress more copies, it was decided to make new recordings. Why has Marek Stryncl decided to remake his interpretation of Dvořák's Symphony No 7? \"I have come to believe,\" he says, \"that our interpretation of this work was not romantic enough. It clung to the legacy and influence of conductor Vaclav Talich who at the end of his life said that he would perform Antonin Dvořák's works without all this romantic overlay.\" This album commences with a substantial extra: the Rhapsody in A Minor, Op 14, B 44. It is an early work dating from 1874. Inspired by the example of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies, Dvorak later began to call it a Symphonic Poem - but did not provide any programme. Ten years after composing the Rhapsody, Dvořák created his Symphony No 7 in D minor, Op 70, B 141. Commissioned by the Philharmonic Society of London, Dvořák conducted its premiere. British critics thought Dvořák the equal of Brahms, while even surpassing him in strength and richness of musical thought.\n\nZelenka: Missa Charitatis & Litaniae Xaverianae\n\nGabriela Eibenova, soprano; Jonathan Mayenschein, counter-tenor; Tobias Hunger, tenor; Martin Schicketanz, bass; Wolf Matthias Friedrich, bass; Jiri Miroslav Prochazka, bass; Ensemble Inegal / Adam Viktora\n\nNibiru 01732231\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThe Zelenka Experts, Ensemble Inegal, directed by Adam Viktora, continue their ongoing series with Zelenka's Missa Charitatis, ZWV 10 and Litaniae Xaverianae, ZWV 154. In common with Zelenka's usual pratice, both of these pieces would be composed for a particular service during the church year. For these Zelenka called upon extra musicians, in consequence the Mass and Litaniae have richer textures. The Litaniae Xaverianae date from 1723. They are written during Zelenka's early years in Prague, for the feast of St Frantisek Xaversky, a leading Jesuit missionary. Zelenka's Missa Charitatis, composed around 1727, falls into the most important period of his career, by which time he was fully absorbed into the musical life of Dresden. Ensemble Inegal, directed by Adam Viktora perform on period instruments. The disc comes with high production values - detailed programme notes and the sung texts in Latin, Czech, English, German and French.\n\nReiko Füting: Mechthild\n\nHanna Herfurtner, soprano; Olive Stahn, soprano; Susi Wirth, narrator; AuditivVokal Dresden; Ensemble Adapter / Olaf Katzer\n\nNew Focus Recordings\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nA Contemporary Opera Set to a Libretto by theologian Christian Lehnert about Beguine mystic Mechthild von Magdeburg. New York-based German composer Reiko Füting releases the world premiere recording of his opera Mechthild, with libretto by poet and theologian Christian Lehnert, on New Focus Recordings. Füting’s opera, which was inspired by the Medieval 'mystery play', premiered in Magdeburg, Germany, 16-18 September 2022, marking the occasion of the ceremonial reopening of the monastery church and the north wing in the art museum Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen Magdeburg. The cross-genre production combines medieval and contemporary music in a sound space and is dedicated to Mechthild von Magdeburg, a Christian medieval mystic and proponent of asceticism, and an important personality in the city's history. The premiere featured sopranos Olivia Stahn and Hannah Herfurtner, actress Susi Wirth, AuditivVokal Dresden, Ensemble Adapter, and New York-based New Chamber Ballet, with Olaf Katzer conducting. In addition, the performance included live-painting by Helge Leiberg and contemporary interviews of homeless people spoken by high school students of the Hegelgymnasium Magdeburg.\n\nGustav Mahler: Symphony No 9\n\nMinnesota Orchestra / Osmo Vänskä\n\nBIS BIS2476 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nFor the latest instalment in their Mahler series, the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of Osmo Vänskä presents what many consider to be the pinnacle of the Austrian composer’s entire work, the Ninth Symphony, his last completed After a vast and emotionally intense first movement that shows an astonishing fluidity of form, theme, texture and tonality, ‘the most glorious thing Mahler has written’ according to Alban Berg, the second movement brings joy and playfulness and seems to evoke both an urban Straussian world and folk music cultures. To the bitter irony and anger of the third movement the last movement, a mystical Adagio, seems to respond with ineffable tenderness. Often regarded as the composer’s monumental both in terms of scale and emotional scope leave taking of the world, the Ninth Symphony can also be understood as a requiem for his daughter who died a few years before, an acknowledgment of the transience of life, a memorial to Vienna, an evocation of fading Austrian and Bohemian landscapes, a homage to a vanishing European cultural world.\n\nFallen to Dust\n\nJames Newby, baritone; Joseph Middleton, piano\n\nBIS BIS2595 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nJames Newby wished to dedicate his second disc on BIS to his sister Laura who passed away in 2015, her daughter and his mother. After singing Gerald Finzi’s ‘Fear no more the heat o’ the sun’ at her funeral, he felt it fitting that the cycle from which it is taken, Let us Garlands Bring , would form the centrepiece of the programme. Alongside this cycle, pianist Joseph Middleton and Newby have designed a programme of English songs that reflect on themes of loss, grief and death but also joy, love and healing with varying styles, sound worlds and atmospheres. George Butterworth, Rebecca Clarke, Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten, Liza Lehmann and Errollyn Wallen are just some of the composers who complete the programme, including Arthur Somervell with his cycle ‘A Shropshire Lad’. Like Heinrich Heine’s poems that Schumann used for his famous cycle Dichterliebe, these poems by Alfred Edward Housman deal withunrequited love in first person lyrics. This disc ends on a lighter note with the whimsical song, ‘The Green eyed Dragon’ by Wolseley Charles, which often concludes live performances as an encore.\n\nMeditatio II – music for mixed choir\n\nSchola Cantorum / Hordur Askelsson\n\nBIS BIS2618 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nWith Meditatio I released in 2016, the Schola Cantorum Reykjavicensis and Hordur Askelsson presented music commemorating the departed. Recorded some six years later, Meditatio II similarly contains compositions that interpret man’s thoughts and feelings about death, and celebrate the immobility and beauty found in age old church texts such as Ave verum corpus, In paradisum, Lux æternaand Agnus Dei . With one exception, the fifteen works for mixed a cappella choir none longer than 6 minutes were written in the 21st century, and they originate in America and Europe. Seven Icelandic composers are represented, five of them from current or former members of the Schola Cantorum. Peaceful rather than desolate, these refined miniatures unfold over slow rhythms, coated with nuances that rarely go beyond the mezzo forte. This disc also includes an impressive arrangement of Sofdu unga Astin min’, a traditional and bittersweet Icelandic lullaby, here sung without words. Founded in 1996 by Hordur Askelsson , who has remained its artistic director to this day, the Schola Cantorum Reykjavicensis is comprised of 21 singers and has appeared on a number of BIS recordings.\n\nBeethoven and Berwald Septets\n\nWigmore Soloists\n\nBIS BIS2707 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nFor their latest project on BIS, the Wigmore Soloists perform two works with unusual instrumentation: Beethoven ’s and Berwald ’s septets for violin, viola, cello, double bass, clarinet, bassoon and horn. If the young Beethoven did not aspire to profundity in his own Septet, he nevertheless managed to create a fine balance between light heartedness and substance. In the tradition of serenade, this work in six movements represents Beethoven at his most warm hearted and relaxed, yet his compositional craft and subtlety are typically sharp. As the septet achieved such fame during his lifetime, Beethoven eventually became irritated by its popularity, which he said overshadowed more mature works. Best known for his symphonies, Swedish composer Franz Berwald also composed a septet that is in no way imitative of Beethoven’s. Berwald had his own voice and his own musical expression, and his artful handling of the wind instruments deserves praises. Thanks to its attractive transparency, Berwald’s Septet consistently exudes freshness thanks to its endearing musical humour and ranks as the finest of his chamber compositions.\n\nSzymanowski: Mythes – music for violin and piano\n\nSueye Park, violin; Roland Pontinen, piano\n\nBIS BIS2652 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nLush, impressionistic, exotic, erotically charged even, Karol Szymanowski’s music appears as a world in its own right, a refuge from the harshest aspects of reality, but also a place in which, paradoxically, the dreamer can find the strength and solace needed to cope with the real world and is drawn into an alternative, heightened state of consciousness. Sueye Park and Roland Pontinen take us on a journey through the Polish composer’s works for violin and piano. While the early Violin Sonata in D minor already shows Szymanowski’s precocious talent in writing for violin, the Romance in D major and the Nocturne et Tarantelle indicate the emergence of a feverish and exotic atmosphere as well as the musical expression of physical intoxication, a characteristic of the composer’s mature works. Mythes (1915) represents Szymanowski at the zenith of his artistry, creating ‘a new mode of expression for the violin’ and through this an other worldly musical language. La Berceuse d’Aïtacho Enia concludes this disc in a dreamy yet troubled mood, as if the pains of the real world had ultimately found a way to reach us.\n\nArmenian Cello Concertos - Khachaturian, Babajanian, Petrossian\n\nAlexander Chaushian, cello; Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra / Eduard Topchjan\n\nBIS BIS2648\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nRecorded in the Aram Khachaturian Concert Hall in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, this disc offers an opportunity to sample music by Armenian composers, here represented by three works for cello and orchestra, and is in a way a follow up to the 2011 release [BIS 1849] which was also devoted to concertante works for cello by Armenian composers. The programme opens with Aram Khachaturian, whose 1946 concerto, which contains many Armenian and Georgian folkloric allusions and rhythmic dances like those of the Ashoug, has been described as being closer to a symphony with cello than to a concerto. The second work, Arno Babajanian’s Cello Concerto, is permeated by specific intonation rooted in Armenian folk music and folklore. The disc concludes with the cello concerto by the French composer of Armenian origin, Michel Petrossian, a work from 2022 entitled 8.4, an allusion to the book of Genesis, chapter 8, verse 4, where Mount Ararat is first mentioned. The work glorifies the symbolic and spiritual aspect of Ararat, the ‘sacred mountain’, and integrates Armenian and Byzantine liturgical chants. The UK based Alexander Chaushian, cello soloist in all of these works, is Armenian by birth, and has secured the expert support of the Armenian National Philharmonic Orchestra under its principal conductor Eduard Topchjan.\n\nBach: Cantatas\n\nAkademie fur Alte Musik Berlin, Michael Volle, Gaechinger Cantorey, Thomanerchor Leipzig, Sachsisches Barockorchester, Hans-Christoph Rademann, Gotthold Schwarz\n\nAccentus Music ACC80571 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThis CD box set features interpretations of Johann Sebastian Bach's cantatas by three outstanding choirs and orchestras. In collaboration with the Akademie fur Alte Musik Berlin, one of the world's leading orchestras specializing in historical performance practice, Michael Volle presents a recording of Bach's cantatas for solo bass. Hans-Christoph Rademann and the Gaechinger Cantorey contrast the dramatic works BWV 19 & 149 with the peaceful and intimate cantatas BWV 169 & 158 in their Naumburg recording. In a third recording, the Saxon Baroque Orchestra and the St. Thomas Choir Leipzig, conducted by 17th Thomaskantor Gotthold Schwarz, interpret the well-known choral cantatas BWV 33, 17 & 99 from Bach's time in Leipzig.\n\nTchaikovsky: Symphony No 5; Franz Liszt: Mazeppa\n\nSymphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks / Zubin Mehta\n\nBR Klassik 900207\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThe Indian conductor Zubin Mehta is closely associated with the city of Munich and the orchestras based there. From 1998 to 2006, he was General Music Director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, and has similarly close ties with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's 2018 Asian tour with Zubin Mehta was voted No. 1 in the \"10 Top Concerts 2018\" by Japanese critics. In January 2020, he conducted the memorial concert of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus for their late chief conductor Mariss Jansons. This BR-KLASSIK CD features recordings of concerts on February 28 and March 1, 2013 in the Philharmonie im Gasteig.\n\nBruckner: Symphony No 4 - 1888 Version\n\nORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra / Markus Poschner\n\nCapriccio C8085\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThe most comprehensive Bruckner Symphonies cycle, including all nineteen available versions. Bruckner’s frantic revisions of his symphonies Nos 3, 4 and 8 followed his disappointment with Hermann Levi’s rejection of the original version of the Eighth Symphony. Helping in this large-scale effort to revise the works were some of Bruckner’s former students – Franz and Joseph Schalk, Ferdinand Lowe, Max von Oberleithner and Cyrill Hynai. The result was that the reputation of these versions – especially the final version of the Fourth – became tarnished as something not quite Echt-Bruckner. It wasn’t until the discovery of photographs of the 1888 version’s manuscript score, and the subsequent publication of Benjamin Korstvedt’s edition of the work, that it became clear that this late edition really did reflect Bruckner’s intentions. To ears familiar with the even better-known 1881 version, the result might sound mystifying, even troubling, but it also surprises with many particularly exquisite passages!\n\nPenderecki: String Quartets; Clarinet Quartet; String Trio\n\nJan Jakub Bokun, clarinet; Meccore String Quartet\n\nCapriccio C5493\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nKrzysztof Penderecki’s works for (string) quartet neatly encapsulate the composer’s stylistic breadth as they track the development of Poland’s most important modern composer throughout his sixty-year career. From the avant-garde rhythmical study that is Quartet No. 1, via an ode to Webern to the elder Penderecki’s neo-Romantic, Schubertian Clarinet Quartet, this collection comprises all his chamber music for three and four strings, even the early neo-Baroque outlier Three Pieces, adapted from his film score for the steamy 1964 movie The Saragossa Manuscript.\n\nMalek Jandali: Concertos\n\nAnthony McGill, Rachel Barton Pine, ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, Marin Alsop\n\nCedille Records CDR90000220\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nClarinetist Anthony McGill and violinist Rachel Barton Pine are featured soloists on a new recording of two concertos composed in response to societal injustices by Syrian composer Malek Jandali, performed by the ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and led by Marin Alsop, a champion of the composer’s work. Malek Jandali, called “deeply enigmatic” by Gramophone, has been praised for writing “heart-rending melodies, lush orchestration, clever transitions and creative textures” (American Record Guide). His repertoire, which ranges from chamber music to large scale orchestral works, integrates Middle-Eastern modes into Western classical forms and harmony. Rachel Barton Pine, “an exciting, boundary-defying performer” (The Washington Post), performs Jandali’s Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (2014), a work that honors “all women who thrive with courage” according to the composer. Jandali’s concerto is in recognition of the women of Syria, continuing his aim to preserve the cultural heritage of his homeland. The Violin Concerto incorporates Syrian melodies and idioms into Jandali’s Western-inspired harmonies and forms. Jandali calls upon an array of Syrian and Arabic music forms and folk melodies including multiple samā’i and bashraf (instrumental pieces), and longa (dances), from different maqam (modes). He also makes use of the oud (Arabic lute) in his symphonic scoring to infuse the work with the authentic sound and feeling of Syria. A particularly notable samā’i inspired by traditional Syrian folk music from the area along the Silk Road Is used for a “Women’s Theme.” This theme is representative of the folk music that is a source of comfort and healing for unjustly detained, peaceful Syrian activists and other women and mothers living in fear. Jandali’s Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra (2021) is dedicated to its performer Anthony McGill (“the total package…stylish, passionate and limitlessly fluent on the clarinet,” Bachtrack), “in memory of all victims of injustice.” McGill says of the work, ”In the midst of the pain and the violence and injustice in the world all we are left with is the ability to pour our hearts and our souls into something more beautiful, into something more powerful, so it can communicate throughout all time and live on.” Like all of Jandali’s works, the clarinet concerto is infused with ancient themes from Jandali’s homeland as a means of preservation. Jandali explores variations on themes from old and traditional Syrian musical forms and modalities, with striking musical effects and wide ranging highs and lows in the orchestral writing.\n\nGeorg Philipp Telemann: Schwanengesang – The Last Orchestral Works\n\nLa Stagione Frankfurt / Michael Schneider\n\nCPO 555533-2 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nIn 1834, the autograph collector Georg Poelchau discovered the musical estate of Georg Michael Telemann, the grandson of Georg Philipp Telemann, on the tower of the Riga Cathedral. This estate, in turn, consisted mostly of score autographs of the grandfather. Part of this treasure is a bundle of nine manuscripts by Telemann from the 1760s as well as the fragment of a letter with a note by the composer: \"I was willing to let my pen rest for a while, because I felt a noticeable decrease in my face; however, a newspaper journal fell into my hands, where I read: the Serene Landgrave of Darmstadt would be celebrating your name festival on August 25. I immediately got into an enthusiasm, and made the draft for pieces coming here...\". This collection of overtures, symphonies and divertimenti, Telemann's swan song from the 86th year of his life, \"is certainly one of the most peculiar and enigmatic, rare and wonderful pieces that has sprung from this musical genealogy - it is a true musical chamber of wonders\" (Wolfgang Hirschmann). With the first complete recording of this Darmstadt volume, a long-cherished wish of Michael Schneider, La Stagione and myself comes true!\n\nCarl Stamitz: Clarinet Concertos Nos. 1, 6 & 8\n\nPaul Meyer, clarinet, direction; Kurpfalzisches Kammerorchester\n\nCPO 555415-2\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\n\"Paul Meyer celebrates the enchanting preciousness of the Mannheim School with immense brilliance and temperament,\" wrote FonoForum in 2019 on the release of the first CD of clarinet concerto recordings by Carl Stamitz. Now Vol. 2 has been released with Concertos 1, 6 and 8 (numbered after Friedrich Carl Kaiser) and they also prove to be immensely virtuosic and effective. All the concertos are interpreted by Paul Meyer, who is not only one of the outstanding and best-known clarinetists in the world, he also shows his conducting qualities here. Concerto No. 1 is one of the best known and most popular works by Stamitz. It fascinates with its virtuosic arrangement through extreme interval leaps and the lively, dance-like elements. Similar in the eighth concerto are the range, the signal motives in the corner movements, the syncopations to the cadenza, and the virtuosic shaping. Stamitz again demonstrates the wide range of technical and compositional possibilities.\n\nWilhelm Berger: Symphony Op 71; Konzertstuck Op 43a\n\nOliver Triendl, piano; Wurttembergische Philharmonie Reutlingen / Clemens Schuldt\n\nCPO 555462-2\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nLike most of the other composers from the circle of the so-called Berlin academics, Wilhelm Berger developed a masterly compositional skill. Stylistically, his music is close to Johannes Brahms, but through occasional use of dissonant harmonies and a preference for contrapuntal compositional techniques, it also points ahead to Max Reger, who succeeded Berger as Meiningen Court Kapellmeister. Considering his short lifetime, the composer's catalog of works is very extensive, with over 100 opus numbers, and his output was highly respected long after his death. His Konzertstuck Op 43a remained unprinted - or cannot be acquired in print to this day. It is by no means a virtuoso concerto that places the piano soloist and his technical abilities in the sole spotlight. Instead, the composer sees the piano as an orchestral, ie polyphonic, instrument that can independently create both voluminous and dense movements. Ten years after the concert piece, Wilhelm Berger put the finishing touches to his most extensive orchestral work to date, the First Symphony in B flat major, Op 71, which was to bring lasting success.\n\nLeopold I: Missa pro defunctis; Tres Lectiones; Motetto de Septem Doloribus Beatae Mariae Virginis\n\nWeser-Renaissance Bremen / Manfred Cordes\n\nCPO 555078-2\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nWhen Margarita Theresa, Emperor Leopold's first wife, died on March 12, 1673, it was a bitter loss for the 33-year-old monarch. He tried to process his grief through music and the intense Missa pro defunctis was composed. This requiem is one of Leopold's most elaborate and personal works, composed for five singing voices and a large instrumental ensemble consisting of two silent tines, three trombones, four violas, and basso continuo. Leopold chose as the key the so-called second tone (related to the modern G minor), as it has been used since the sixteenth century for 'afflicted and sad things'. As was common in 17th century music, the musical figures that interpret the text are also numerous. Impressive! And even in the case of the Tres Lectiones, it could not be due to reverence alone if these pieces were still played by the court orchestra well into the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nRobert Kahn, Vincent d’Indy: Trios for Piano, Clarinet & Cello\n\nBawandi Trio\n\nCPO 555596-2\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nFor the project of the newly founded clarinet trio called \"Bawandi\" the three young musicians Mario Haring, Alexandre Castro-Balbi and Patrick Hollich came together. They designed a diverse, highly interesting program with a clear focus, namely the rediscovery and reinterpretation of the works of two composers who had fallen into oblivion: the Jewish Robert Kahn, who had fled into exile, and Cesar Franck's successor as president at the Societe de National de Musique Vincent d'Indy. Both Kahn and d'Indy were recognized and highly esteemed composers during their lifetimes, but due to the circumstances of their environment - as different as both personalities and circumstances were - they became less important. Both composers deserve to be looked at from a new perspective. That is why this new production was created on the highest musical level. A young ensemble that deserves full attention.\n\nDomenico Sarro, Filippo Colle, Federigo Fiorillo, Gennaro Manna: Marvels of the 18th century in Naples – Symphonies & Violin Concertos\n\nFabrizio Falasca, violin; La Real Cappella di Napoli / Ivano Caiazza\n\nCPO 555315-2\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThe Neapolitan school of the eighteenth century is one of the most glorious moments of Neapolitan cultural life. A characteristic feature of the Neapolitan school is the opera buffa. Two theaters were mainly dedicated to it in the 18th century, the Fiorentini and the San Bartolomeo, but with the arrival of King Charles of Bourbon in Naples, people began to think on a larger scale: the San Bartolomeo was demolished and the Real Teatro di San Carlo was built. It was immediately a \"place of excellence\", both for the magnificence of the building and for its artistic quality. The Real Cappella in Naples was founded in the middle of the sixteenth century and the most important composers and artists of the period composed for it, including Pergolesi, Porpora, Scarlatti, etc. The current orchestra \"Real Cappella\", composed of musicians from the Teatro di San Carlo, was inspired by this particular historical period and the goal is to raise awareness of almost forgotten Neapolitan masterpieces of the eighteenth century. Thus, our new release features two symphonies by Domenico Sarro and Gennaro Manna with the Real Cappella, and two violin concertos from the period by Filippo Colle and Federigo Fiorillo with the fascinating Italian violinist Fabrizio Falasca. There are real gems to be discovered here!\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Symphonies Nos 34, 35 & 36\n\nSlovak Sinfonietta / Matthias Manasi\n\nHanssler Classic HC22078\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nMatthias Manasi is rated as one of the most sought-after and most outstanding conductors of his generation, earning himself a distinguished name both on the Opera and concert podiums. With a diverse repertoire range he is recognized for his knowledgeable and insightful interpretations, en compassing the great symphonic and operatic repertoire, contemporary scores, and historically informed performances. He is celebrated for the extraordinary combination of precision and temperament of his conducting and the convincing depth of his musical understanding, The Austrian newspaper 'Heute' wrote after a concert: \"Matthias Manasi delivered an outstanding performance in the legendary, heavenly acoustics of the Golden Hall of the Musikvere in Vienna\". The 'Factanet Rome' wrote after a concert: \"It was a great interpretation that added value to Manasi's work and that proclaims him as one of the most important conductors of our time\".\n\nBirds with Roots – Songs for Voice, Viola & Piano - Sarah Nemtsov, Johannes Brahms, Janot Roskin, Adolf Busch, Walter Zimmermann\n\nTehila Nini Goldstein, Julia Rebekka Adler, Jascha Nemtsov\n\nHanssler Classic HC22079\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nBrahms composed his \"Geistliches Wiegenlied\" in 1863 as a wedding present for two friends of his, the famous violinist Joseph Joachim and contralto Amalie Schneeweiss. Brahms and Joachim both loved the sound of the viola, a chamber instrument that was only just developing a concert repertoire. This Classical composition was the starting point for the programme of the present CD, which combines original works for trio from three centuries in the formation voice - viola - piano, including two specially written vocal cycles by Sarah Nemtsov and Walter Zimmermann. The programme represents a kind of musical engagement with themes that are gaining new relevance today: persecution and expulsion, homelessness and homesickness. The texts and their settings sometimes enter into an unexpected dialogue.\n\nJohanna Muller-Hermann: Piano Quintet Op 31; Violin Sonata Op 5\n\nOliver Triendl, Daniel Gaede, Nina Karmonl, Benedikt Schneider, Antoaneta Emanuilova\n\nHanssler Classic HC22082\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThe chamber music of Johanna Muller-Hermann is distinguished by its focus on pure melody, which often gives the music a lyrical character, but which she is quite willing to interrupt with stringent use of rhythm and contrast.\n\nC P E Bach: Piano Concertos & Other Works for Solo Piano\n\nOrazio Sciortino, piano; Orchestra di Padova e del Veneto\n\nHanssler Classic HC23008\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach and the keyboard concerto - a lifelong relationship, challenging and exhausting, altogether fruitful, brilliant, and even spectacular into the bargain. As a 19-year-old (under the eyes of his father, so to speak) he wrote in Leipzig his first keyboard concerto; at the age of 74 in Hamburg he finished, in the year of his death, his last example of the genre. In-between lies a treasury of fifty keyboard concertos, colossal and fathomless. It is a wonder that this uncommonly rich and stylistically influential genre of the composer is only now coming to light. Of all the genres of composition, C P E Bach's keyboard concertos have guarded their secret longest as unpublished music - that is, precisely the genre of works that qualify as the most personal and most advanced of his compositional oeuvre. He himself says of this: \"Because I have had to create most of my works for particular persons and for the public, I have therein always been more constrained than with the few pieces which I prepared just for myself. Among all my works, especially for keyboard, are just a few ... concertos, which I composed with total freedom and for my own use.\"\n\nGrazyna Bacewicz: Piano Concerto; Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra; Overture; Music for Strings, Trumpets and Percussion\n\nPeter Jablonski, piano; Elisabeth Brauß, piano; Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra / Nicholas Collon\n\nOndine ODE1427-2\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThe music of Grazyna Bacewicz (1909–1969) has been enjoying a revival during the past two decades. Bacewicz was an outstanding figure in twentieth-century music, a major Polish composer and a versatile musician. This album by the award-winning pianist Peter Jablonski, pianist Elisabeth Brauß, the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and conductor Nicholas Collon includes some rarely recorded gems: the composer’s Piano Concerto together with the late Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in its first digital recording. Also included is the composer’s homage to Bartok, Music for Strings, Trumpets and Percussion, as well as the composer’s early exuberant Overture written during the German occupation of Poland.\n\nGorecki: Church Songs, Op 84\n\nPolish Chamber Choir / Jan Lukaszewski\n\nOndine ODE1428-2D (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nHenryk Mikolaj Gorecki (1933–2010) achieved an international success in the mid-1990s, with his Symphony No. 3, “Symphony of Sorrowful Songs”. Since then, Gorecki’s name has been associated almost exclusively with this piece. However, his music is much more than this one brilliant work. Gorecki never looked at musical fashions, but consistently created his own sound universe. In the 1980s Gorecki, feeling misunderstood, stepped back from the official concert life in Poland. He reached out to simple folk and church melodies, making their choral arrangements. He treated them with a great devotion and humility. In 1985, the composer drew on traditional church songs collected in the 19th-century Śpiewnik kościelny (Church Songbook) by Jan Siedlecki. He first selected five songs from it, which made up the cycle of five Marian Songs, Op. 54, for mixed choir a cappella. A year later, Gorecki decided to compile other church songs of various character and associated with different liturgical seasons. This led to a collection of twenty Church Songs for a cappella choir today known as his Op. 84. Apart from two, the songs were not published during composer’s lifetime. This album by the Polish Chamber Choir led by Jan lukaszewski offers this choral gem for the first time sang in Latin.\n\nEugen Engel: Grete Minde\n\nMarko Pantelic, Kristi Anna Isene, Jan Arik Redmer, Raffaela Lintl, Jadwiga Postrozna, Zoltan Nyari, Paul Sketris, Johannes Stermann, Opernchor des Theaters Magdeburg, Magdeburgische Philharmonie / Anna Skryleva\n\nOrfeo C260352 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nThis recording of Eugen Engel’s opera Grete Minde documents an extraordinary event: as the only opera by the formerly unknown composer, it had to wait until 13 February 2022 for its premiere at Theater Magdeburg, almost 90 years after its completion and 80 years after the death of its creator. This deferred debut was preceded by years of behind-the-scenes work, including the compilation of musical material from the handwritten manuscript, as well as biographical research on Engel himself. The fact that only a few historical references to him exist is partly due to the fact that music was not his main profession; the primary cause, however, stems from the persecution and murder of almost his entire family during the Shoah (Holocaust). The accompanying booklet to this 2-Discs live recording of the opera’s premiere contains liner notes by head dramaturge Ulrike Schroder, artist biographies, and the full libretto in both German and English.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Cosi fan tutte; Le nozze di Figaro; Don Giovanni; Die Zauberflote; Der Schauspieldirektor - Complete Recordings\n\nLisa della Casa, Hilde Guden, Christa Ludwig, Edith Wiens, Kurt Bohme, Cesare Siepi, Deon van der Walt, Wiener Staatsopernchor, Wiener Philharmoniker, Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Karl Bohm, Josef Krips, Erich Kleiber, Ferdinand Leitner\n\nProfil PH23005 (10 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nMozart's operas are unique. They have inspired people for generations and captivate with their diversity and virtuosity. Mozart's music is as diverse as his operas: the most varied themes and emotions. His music is unique and expressive. It is so full of joie de vivre, beauty and emotion that it captivates people. Mozart's operas are a true masterpiece and a real treat for every music lover.\n\nAnton Bruckner: Symphonies 3-9\n\nNDR Sinfonieorchester, Munchner Philharmoniker / Gunter Wand\n\nProfil PH23012 (8 CDs)\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nGunter Wand (1912-2002) left us dozens of gramophone records: complete symphonic cycles and impressive live recordings of his concerts with the NDR Symphony Orchestra and the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The archetypical anti-star all his life and for that very reason under-appreciated, th is conductor only attained international recognition in his old age as an unequalled interpreter of classical music. Accordingly, most of these multiple-award-winning benchmark recordings date from his later years. Gunter Wand's Bruckner recordings are critically acclaimed; a best-of-collection of his legendary Bruckner-Interpretations (1985-2000) on eight CDs.\n\nBrahms by Arrangement, Vol 2: Orchestrations by Robin Holloway - Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann\n\nBBC Symphony Orchestra / Paul Mann\n\nToccata Classics TOCC0450\n\nRelease: 5 May 2023\n\nComposers who orchestrate the music of earlier colleagues often serve them best when they add something of themselves to the work in hand.
