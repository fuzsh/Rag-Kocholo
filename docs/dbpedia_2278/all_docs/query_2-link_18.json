At that time, his father was teaching in St. Peterâs Catholic Primary School,Bambui. He taught here for aboutseven years, from 1965 to 1972. Then he was transferred to Nkar Parish in Kumbo Diocese,specifically in C.S Vekovi. Here,Hedid his Primary One. We were in Vekovi for abouttwo years, then his father was transferred to C.S Sop.While in Sop Parish, we lived in our family house, in a small village called Tavirer. Here,Hedid his Primary Two in a school called C.S Nkarkui, a catholic school in one of the mission stations of Sop Parish. His father did not last long in Sop Parish. He was transferred to C.S Baba I, one of the mission stations of Ndop Parish at that time. He taught in Baba 1 from about 1976-1982. It was in C.S BabaHethatHecompleted his primary education from 1976-1981. While in Baba 1,He had his First Communion and received the sacrament of Confirmation.\n\nJust before completing his primary education,Hetold his father thatHefelt called to the priesthood. He welcomed this with great joy. He wanted to send me to Bishop Rogan College Small Soppo,but he could not meet up with the financial requirement because two of his sisters were already schooling in St Augustineâs College, Nso.After seeking the advice of some of his close friends, he decided to send me to Government High School Kumbo.Hewas admitted into this institutionforthe academic year1982/1983 anddid both the first and second cyclesin the same school obtaining both his O/L and A/L GCE.Hegraduated from this school in 1989. Upon completion of his high school education,Heapplied for the priesthood under the Archdiocese of Bamenda.Hewas sent by his bishop, Archbishop Paul Verdzekov, to Bishop Rogan College, Small Soppo, Buea, as a prospective seminarian.Hewas not alone, there were other fellow prospective seminarians with me. As prospective seminarians we taught and followed the school programme of minor seminarians. In addition, we had classes in Latin and Pidgin English.

In June 1997,Hewas ordained a deacon and on 15th April1998,Hewas ordained a priest, together with Fr. Gregory CheoNgwa and Fr Bonaventure Ndong. That same yearHewas sent to Esu Parish, a newly created Parish together with Fr Isaiah Fru Benedict as pioneer priests of the parish. It was a good experience laying the formation of the new parish given the many challenges associated with beginning a new parish. More challenging were the mission station treks to Furawa area that were very tedious but very fulfilling. His stay in Esu lasted from 1998-2000. From EsuHewas transferred to Bafut Parish. Pastoral work there was intense. Fr Joseph NchituandHehada heavy pastoral workload: morethan 20 mission stations, catholic primary schools, the Girls Vocational Secondary School and the Franciscan Tertiary Sisters.Hedid not last long in Bafut. After one yearHewas appointed Parish Priest of Widikum Parish.\n\nÂ\n\nHe served for six years in Widikum Parish, from 2001-2007. For those who knowWidikum Parish they will agree with me that it is a parish of pastoral challenges especially in terms of difficult terrains and distant mission stations. The Menka and Ambelle areas are particularly challenging. It was always a joy reaching out to people in these areas. It is one of those parishes in the archdiocese,that to his thinking, completes seminary formation. Of recent,Menka has been created a Parish. While in Widikum ParishHewas appointed the Dean of Widikum Deanery.\n\nIn 2007He was transferred to the St John Mary Vianney Spiritual Formation Centre, Bafut. Here,Heserved as a Bursar, Spiritual Director and Vocationsâ Director for the Archdiocese of Bamenda for 6 years. With a team of religious we organized visits to parishes in the archdiocese during which we meet vocation groups and spoke in each parish community about vocations. These visits had a very big impact on promoting and raising awareness on vocations. While in Vianney CentreHe accompanied the candidates as Spiritual Director, taught and worked on the accounts of the Centre.Healso personally decidedto reach out to catholic students in COTEC Bafutand involved students from the Centre to teach doctrine and prepare those who were in need of the sacraments. Priests of the Centre were permanent priests who celebrated daily and Sunday masses at St Albertâs Comprehensive College, (SACC)Bafut, a school run by Marist Brothers of the Schools.\n\nIn 2013,He was transferred to KedjomKeku as Parish Priest. Here,Heworked for one year and was sent for further studies to Florence, in Italy, whereHestudied dogmatic theology for 7 years at the end of whichHewas appointed as formator in St Thomas Aquinasâ Major Seminary, Bambui whereHeam serving presently, teaching dogmatic theology and the father in-charge of compound care."
