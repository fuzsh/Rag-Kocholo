        "text": "Archbishop Julio Murat, Apostolic Nuncio to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea was the chief celebrant of Thursday’s ceremony attended by Archbishop Andrew Nkea of the Bamenda Archdiocese, Bishops, and high-ranking Members of Government.\n\nThe installation and canonical possession of the fifth Diocesan Bishop of Buea took place at the Divine Mercy Co-cathedral in line with Canon 382 §1 which states, “One promoted as bishop cannot assume the exercise of the office entrusted to him before he has taken canonical possession of the diocese. Nevertheless, he is able to exercise offices which he already had in the same diocese at the time of promotion, without prejudice to the prescript of Can. 409, §2”.\n\nCanon 382 §2 adds that: “Unless he is prevented by a legitimate impediment, one promoted to the office of a diocesan bishop must take canonical possession of his diocese within four months of receipt of the apostolic letter if he has not already been consecrated a bishop; if he has already been consecrated, within two months from receipt of this letter.”\n\nIn the present case, Bishop Michael was already consecrated Bishop on March 25, 2017, and thus it is in line with canon law that he takes possession on Thursday, February 25, 2020, since he received his letter on January 5, 2021.\n\nDespite the soaring positive cases of COVID-19 in the country, the ceremony still went on in a bid to respect Canon 382§4 which states that: “It is strongly recommended that the taking of canonical possession be done within a liturgical act in the cathedral church with the clergy and people gathered together.”\n\nFinally, Can. 383 §1 states: “In exercising the function of a pastor, a diocesan bishop is to show himself concerned for all the Christian faithful entrusted to his care, of whatever age, condition, or nationality they are, whether living in the territory or staying there temporarily; he is also to extend an apostolic spirit to those who are not able to make sufficient use of ordinary pastoral care because of the condition of their life and to those who no longer practice their religion.”\n\nAs Apostolic Administrator of Buea Diocese, Bishop Michael Bibi had already begun to show concern for all the Christians faithful of Buea Diocese to the extent that some are already calling him the “Travelling Bishop”, An appellation that depicts his zeal to be close to all the faithful having visited all the parishes even those in crisis-hit areas.\n\nSome he has visited more than twice. I am definitely sure that he will continue with that pastoral zeal.\n\nWho is Bishop Bibi?\n\nBishop Michael Miabesue Bibi was born on July 28, 1971, at Bamessing, in the Archdiocese of Bamenda. He is presently 49. He has been a priest for 20 years, and a bishop for 3 years.\n\nOn April 26, 2000, at 28, he was ordained Priest for the Archdiocese of Bamenda at St. Joseph, Cathedral, Bamenda by the then Archbishop of Bamenda: Archbishop Paul Verdzekov.\n\nHe holds a master’s degree in Theology, with a specialization in Catechetic from Maryvale Institute in Birmingham, England.\n\nHe is also an alumnus of St. Thomas Aquinas Major Seminary of Bambui in Bamenda where he studied Philosophy and Theology.\n\nAs a priest, he served as Chaplain of the Sacred Heart College, Mankon, Assistant Archdiocesan Financial Secretary, and Special Assistant to the Archbishop and Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Bamenda.\n\nOn January 24, 2017, at 45, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Bamenda, Cameroon, and Titular Bishop of Amudarsa, by Pope Francis at the request of the then Archbishop of Bamenda, Archbishop Cornelius Fontem Esua in congruence with the Code of Canon Law, Can. 403 §1 which states: “When the pastoral needs of a diocese suggest it, one or more auxiliary bishops are to be appointed at the request of the diocesan bishop. An auxiliary bishop does not possess the right of succession.”\n\nOn March 25, 2017, at 45, he was consecrated as the Titular Bishop of Amudarsa and Auxiliary Bishop of Bamenda, Cameroon.\n\nCanon 375 §2 states: “Through episcopal consecration itself, bishops receive with the function of sanctifying also the functions of teaching and governing; by their nature, however, these can only be exercised in hierarchical communion with the head and members of the college.”\n\nAt his Episcopal Consecration, the Principal Consecrator was Archbishop Cornelius Fontem Esua, Archbishop of Bamenda, while the Principal Co-\n\nConsecrators were Bishop Agapitus Enuyehnyoh Nfon, Bishop of Kumba, and Bishop George Nkuo, Bishop of Kumbo.\n\nCanon 375 §1 states: “Bishops, who by divine institution succeed to the place of the Apostles through the Holy Spirit who has been given to them, are constituted pastors in the Church so that they are teachers of doctrine, priests of sacred worship, and ministers of governance.”\n\nOn December 28, 2019, at the age of 48, he was appointed Apostolic Administrator of Buea, and he zealously served until January 5, 2021.\n\nOn January 5, 2021, at the age of 49, he was appointed Diocesan Bishop of Buea, Cameroon by the Holy Father Pope Francis.\n\nCanon 376 states: “Bishops to whom the care of some diocese is entrusted are called diocesan; others are called titular.” The appointment was published by the Holy See Press Office on Tuesday, January 5 as follows: “Resignations and Appointments, 05.01.2021. Appointment of the bishop of Buea, Cameroon. The Holy Father has appointed Bishop Michael Miabesue Bibi, until now titular of Amudarsa and auxiliary of the metropolitan archdiocese of Bamenda, as bishop of the diocese of Buea, Cameroon.”\n\nCanon 377 §1states: “The Supreme Pontiff freely appoints bishops or confirms those legitimately elected.”"
