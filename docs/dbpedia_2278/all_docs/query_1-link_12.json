        "text": "14 - 08.10.2005\n\nSUMMARY\n\n♦ COMMEMORATION OF THE XL ANNIVERSARY OF THE INSTITUTION OF THE SYNOD OF BISHOPS\n\nThis afternoon, Saturday, 8 October 2005, at 4:30 p.m. with the prayer Adsumus, the Special General Congregation for the Commemoration of the XL Anniversary of the Institution of the Synod of Bishops began.\n\nIn the opening, the Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, H. Exc. Most Rev. Msg. Nikola ETEROVIĆ introduced the works with the following discourse:\n\nSynod of Bishops: privileged Expression of the episcopal collegiality\n\nMost Holy father, Venerable Synodal Fathers, Dear brothers and Sisters\n\nIt is a great grace of the one and Triune God to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Synod of bishops during a Synodal Assembly. This providential coincidence locates the participants at this commemorative act in medias res. In fact, it is superfluous to describe in detail the synodal activity to those who are actively taking part in it.\n\nHowever, the 40th anniversary of the Synod of Bishops is an opportunity to study further in depth the theological and legal nature of this institution which, created during Vatican Council II, tried to maintain the spirit and methodology of work adapted to its properties. Not entering the concrete results, a theme which exceeds these words for the occasion, for 4 decades, the synod of bishops has had the great merit to develop the synodal dimension of the corpus episcoporum, to foment episcopal collegiality among the Bishops and with the Holy father, Bishop of Rome and head of the college itself in an environment of deep ecclesial communion. In the synodal Assemblies real episcopal collegiality is experienced, although in a different way to ecumenical councils.\n\nBefore listening to the words of their Eminences the Speakers, I wish to indicate some statistical data concerning the Synod of Bishops.\n\nEstablished on 15 September 1965, the synod of bishops has up to now had 4 Presidents, four popes: Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. His Holiness benedict XVI is presiding over the Synod of bishops for the first time. During the brief pontificate, John Paul I, practically had no time to exercise the office of President of the Synod. Hence, Paul VI and John Paul II are two Roman Pontiffs who marked the history of the synod of bishops. Out of 11 Ordinary general Assemblies, celebrated till now, 4 were held during the pontificate of the servant of God Paul VI, respectively in 1967, in 1971, in 1974 and in 1977. The same pontiff held an Extraordinary general assembly in 1969.\n\nBy number of synodal assemblies celebrated, the Servant of God, John Paul II can be called the Synod Pope. He presided over 6 ordinary general Assemblies, in 1980, in 1983, in 1987, in 1990, in 1994 and in 2001; an Extraordinary general Assembly in 1985, and 8 Special Assemblies: 1980 for Holland; 1991 for Europe; 1994 for Africa; 1995 for Lebanon; 1997 for America; 1998 for Asia; 1998 for Oceania and 1999 for Europe.\n\nIn its now illustrious history, the Synod of Bishops had 4 Secretary generals: from 1967 to 1979 His Exc. the Most Rev Msg. Ladislao Rubin; from 1979 to 1985 His Exc.the Most Rev. Msg. Jozef Tomko; from 1985 to 2004 His Em. Card. Jan Pieter Schotte, C.I.C.M.. From 11 February 2004, this office has been covered by His Exc. The Most Rev. Msg. Nikola Eterovic.\n\nThe result of the synodal experiences have been, besides other things, 8 post-synodal Apostolic exhortations: Evangelii nuntiandi; catechesi tradendae; Familiaris consortio; reconciliatio et paenitentia; Christifideles laici; Pastores dabo vobis; Vita consecrata e Pastores gregis.\n\nThen, one has to mention 6 post-Synodal Apostolic Exhoirdation of the Special Assemblies:Ecclesia in Africa; A New Hope for Lebanon; Ecclesia in America; Ecclesia in Asia; Ecclesia in Oceania; Ecclesia in Europa.\n\nThe aforementioned documents have had a great influence on the life of the catholic church.\n\nIn all 21 synodal Assemblies 3, 972 Fathers participated, of whom 2,474 in 11 General Assemblies, 311 in 2 Extraordinary General Assemblies and 1,187 in Special ones. The more reduced number concerns the Synod for holland with 19 Synodal Fathers. The highest number refers to the current 11th Ordinary general Assembly with 256 Synodal fathers.\n\nThe Synod of Bishops has had the privilege that two cardinals, who are relator generals, of the Ordinary general Assemblies, respectively of 1974 and of 1980, became Popes. They refer to His. Em. Card. Karol Wojtyla and, then, His Em. Card. Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nDuring the 40 years the Synod of Bishops has undergone various amendments in the working methodology. In this assembly we are experiencing the last one, done according to the wise indications of the Holy father Benedict XVI, who has great synodal experience.\n\nThe Synod of bishops is at the service of the ecclesial communion through the episcopal college whose head is the Bishop of Rome. Since the Church is always alive and young, through the grace of the Holy spirit, so also the Synod of bishops remains open to the inspiration of the Spirit of the risen Lord and is present in His church, in particular in the sacrament of the Eucharist, for the glory of god the father and the salvation of the world.\n\nThe tangible sign of the SynodÂs youth is also the fact that over half of the Synodal fathers of the XI Ordinary general Assembly take part for the first time in a synodal assembly. This is a sign of hope for the future of the Church which, in spite of adversities of various nature, full of trust in divine providence, continues to carry out the mission entrusted to her by the Lord Jesus:ÂGo, therefore, make disciples of all nations; baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy SpiritÂ (Mt 28:19).\n\n[00201-02.04] [NNNNN] [Original text: Italian]\n\nThe following reports and communications were presented in the Hall:\n\nI.

REPORTS\n\n● The Synod of Bishops is 40 years old - Theological aspects of the Synod of Bishops\n\nH. Em. Card. Jozef TOMKO, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples; President of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses\n\nCardinal Jozef Tomko, the President of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses, begins his report with an introduction, giving his experiences pertaining to the Synod of Bishops and his participation in the various Synods of the past. He then continues with various points about the Synod of Bishops, which was instituted by Paul VI with the motu proprio ÂApostolica sollicitudoÂ. Later, John Paul II consolidated the autonomy and increased the authority and collegiality of the Synod. The Synod of Bishops was instituted as a Âpermanent council of Bishops for the Universal ChurchÂ, subject directly to the Pope and has its nature as a natural ecclesiastic institution, representing all the Catholic Episcopacy, and perpetual by nature. The finalities are to give information and advice; and may deliberate on certain matters, with the Roman Pontiff ratifying the SynodÂs decisions. The theological foundation of the Synod of Bishops can be found in the unity of the Church expressed by the life of communion of the local churches and the collegiality between all the Bishops (communio et collegialitas).The Synod of Bishops represents the Catholic Episcopacy in the whole world in a moral and manifest way, its decisions are consultive and may become deliberative only by mandate of the Supreme Pontiff. As for the consulting aspect of the Synod of Bishops, John Paul II goes beyond the formal and juridical aspects of the Synod vote and places it in the context of the Church as an organism of communion of faith. In conclusion, Cardinal Tomko compares the Synod of Bishops to a heart, a marvelous ecclesial osmosis that has been going on for the past forty years.\n\n[Presentation - 00164-02.04] [NNNNN] [Original text: Italian]\n\n● Four decades of institutional development - Legal aspects of the Synod of Bishops\n\nH. Em. Card. Péter ERDŐ, Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest\n\nThe Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, His Em. Cardinal Peter ERDÖ, during the XI Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, commented on the theme: Four Decades of Institutional Development - Juridical Aspects on the Synod of BishopsÂ. In the above report, he referred to the particular juridical nature and physiognomy of the Synod of Bishops, following the current Canon Law. Cardinal ERDÖ underlined the functions and the manifestations that were achieved by the Synod during the past decades, placing a special emphasis on some fundamental points of its development and on the main points of its ministry. He also indicated the role that the Synod has in the promotion of Episcopal collegiality and communion between the Bishops, as well as in the study and the solution on problems concerning the mission of the Church in todayÂs world. The Archbishop also underlined the importance of the Synod as a consulting organism for the Pope; also analyzing the merit of the Synod as an Assembly in favor of relationships between the Pope and the Bishops and of them altogether, facilitating the analysis of the questions relative to the different episcopal conferences in the context of the Universal Church.\n\nIn the same report, the functions of the Synod were defined, explaining the differences between general, extraordinary and special, and the relationship between the Pope and the Synod was made clearer, underlining the merit of the Synod, inasmuch as it deals with themes concerning faith and traditions, observing and the consolidation of the discipline of the Church, the reality of the Sacraments and the mission of the Church in general, and the particular sensitivity in dealing with themes of daily life.\n\nThe usefulness of the Synod was illustrated by Cardinal Peter ERDÖ, due to the opportunity to present moral principles applied to the social order and the ability to judge human actions, when this is demanded by the fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of souls.\n\n[Presentation - 00135-02.02] [NNNNN] [Original text: Italian]\n\nII. NOTICES\n\n● Particular Synod for Batavia - Special Assembly for the Netherlands\n\nH. Em. Card. Adrianus SIMONIS, Archbishop of Utrecht (Member of the synodal Assembly)\n\nThe intervention by His Em. Cardinal Adrianus Simonis, Archbishop of Utrecht, starts with the events that, from the ÂCouncil of NoordwijkerhoutÂ,lead to the convocation, in the Vatican, from January 14th to the 31st 1980, of the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the theme of ÂThe Pastoral Situation in the NetherlandsÂ. The author notes that this convocation was originated from an intuition by Cardinal Willebrands and Pope John Paul II, who knew how to foresee the problems posed to the Church in the Netherlands in the areas of faith, doctrine, morals and discipline. And that this could have negatively influenced the Church in its entirety. He gives a brief retrospect on the participation and the results of the Synod in question. The text concludes with a rapid presentation of welcome of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Synod - which, in the majority of occasions, were not accepted - as well as the Post Synodal work, which reality has reaffirmed. In fact, todayÂs generations are marked, in a greater way, by the polarization that characterized the years of the convocation of the ÂCouncil of NoordwijkerhoutÂ and only wish to be Catholics in communion with the universal Church.\n\n[Presentation - 00124-02.02] [NNNNN] [Original text: Italian]\n\n● Convocation of the Special Assembly - Special Assembly for Africa\n\nH.Exc. Most. Rev. Msg. Paul VERDZEKOV, Archbishop of Bamenda\n\n(Member of the synodal Assembly and of the post-synodal Council)\n\nAlmost twenty-four years after the decision of Pope Paul VI to establish the Synod of Bishops, his Successor, Pope John Paul II, announced on 6 January 1989, the Solemnity of the Epiphany, that he decided to convoke a Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. It was his desire right from the very onset, Âto ensure that this Synod would be authentically and unequivocally African. At the same time, it was of fundamental importance that the Special Assembly should be celebrated in full communion with the universal Church.Â To this Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops, Pope John Paul II assigned the following theme: ÂThe Church in Africa and her Evangelising Mission Towards the Year 2000: ÂYou shall be my witnessesÂ (Acts 1:8).Â\n\nIn the eyes of Pope John Paul II, it seemed appropriate to convoke this Special Assembly for the purpose of promoting Âan organic pastoral solidarity throughout Africa and the adjacent Islands.Â He added, furthermore, that in preparation for the Special Assembly, all concerned Âshould cover all the important aspects of the life of the Church in Africa, and in particular should include evangelization, inculturation, dialogue, pastoral care in social areas and the means of social communications.Â\n\nPreparation for the Special Assembly, and the celebration of the Special Assembly itself, achieved a great deal to raise awareness and consciousness about the unity of the Catholic Church in every part of the African continent. In particular, African Catholics became more conscious of the unity of Catholics of North Africa and of Egypt with the Catholics of all the countries of the Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAFRICA HAS CHANGED SINCE THE SPECIAL ASSEMBLY\n\nIn an Address presented to the Twelfth Plenary Assembly of SECAM held at Mondo Migliore, near Rome, in October 200, five years after the promulgation of the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Africa, Cardinal Jan Pieter Schotte, the then-General Secretary of the Synod of Bishops, said, inter alia:\n\nÂOf the fifty-three African countries, seventeen, or one-third, have been the object of armed conflicts of varying length and varying intensity, but which have once again sown death and desolation on this continent. Cardinal Schotte went on to cite Pope John Paul II who manifestly spoke of this political situation, saying: ÂToday, in the greatest silence, intimidation and killing still continue....I wish to address the political leaders of these countries: if violent attainment of power becomes the norm, if democratic representation is systematically put aside, if corruption and the arms trade continue to rage, then Africa will never experience peace or development.\n\nWHAT HAS THE CHURCH IN AFRICA DONE WITH THE POST-SYNODAL APOSTOLIC EXHORTATION ECCLESIA IN AFRICA?\n\nIn an effort to implement the guidelines and Orientations given by Pope John Paul II in Ecclesia in Africa, the Church in Africa has striven, over the last ten years, to carry out what the Special Assembly prescribed with regard to Evangelisation, namely: Proclamation, Inculturation, Dialogue, Justice and Peace and the Media of Social Communication.\n\nMindful of the fact that only 14% of the total population of Africa was made up of Catholics ten years ago, the Church in Africa has striven, over the last ten years, to intensify its Proclamation of the Gospel to Non-Christians, increasingly and unceasingly updating her channels for that Proclamation. Mindful of ChristÂs mandate: ÂGo, therefore, make disciples of all nationsÂ (Mt 28:19), the Church in Africa has recognised, over the last ten years, that the Proclamation of the Gospel is meant for all the people of Africa, without exception.\n\nWith regard to Inculturation, namely, the process b y which Catechesis takes flesh in the various African cultures, the Church in Africa has certainly endeavoured to carry out the clear Orientations of the Special Assembly in this regard,. Two fundamental criteria of genuine Inculturation have ever been kept in mind by African bishops, namely, compatibility with the Gospel and communion with the Universal Church.\n\nWith regard to the Liturgy in particular, it must be recognised that errors have indeed occurred, here and there, out of ignorance of what Ecclesia in Africa actually said about Inculturation. While such few and scattered errors certainly need to be firmly corrected, the overall picture, with regard to Inculturation, especially in the Liturgy, demonstrates that over the last ten years, the Church in Africa has endeavoured to be uncompromisingly faithful to the following words of Pope John Paul II addressed to the Bishops of Kenya in May 1980:\n\nÂBy respecting, preserving and fostering the particular riches and values of your peopleÂs cultural heritage, you will be in a position to lead them to a better understanding of the mystery of Christ, which is also to be lived in the noble, concrete and daily experience of African life. There is no question of adulterating the Word of God, or emptying the Cross of its power (cf. 1 Cor 1:17), but rather of bringing Christ into the very centre of African life and of lifting up all African life to Christ. Thus, not only is Christianity relevant to Africa, but Christ, in the Members of his Body, is African.Â\n\nWith regard to Dialogue, the Church in Africa has certainly endeavoured, ever since the publication of Ecclesia in Africa ten years ago, to foster and encourage better relationships and cooperation with other Christian Churches and Ecclesial Communities. Wherever possible, the Church in Africa has concretely manifested her willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation with Islamic Communities.\n\nWith regard to dialogue with African Traditional Religion, the Particular Churches of Africa have certainly striven over the last ten years, in different ways, to follow the Orientations of Ecclesia in Africa. In this Dialogue with Adherents of African Traditional Religion, the African Bishops, while openly rejoicing on account of the innumerable Âseeds of the WordÂ which they contain, and on account of the fact that they can constitute a preparation for the Gospel, have, nevertheless, been mindful at all times of the following words of Pope Paul VI:\n\nÂWe wish to point out, above all today, that neither respect for these religions nor the complexity of the questions raised, is an invitation to the Church to withhold from these non-Christians the proclamation of Christ. On the contrary the Church holds that these multitudes have the right to know the riches of the mystery of Christ....Â\n\nIn the realm of Justice and Peace, the Church in Africa has certainly striven to be Âthe voice of the voicelessÂ as demanded by the Special Assembly. Active Justice and Peace Commissions have been set up in most Parishes, in most Particular Churches, and at the level of several Episcopal Conferences.\n\nFinally, with regard to the Means of Social Communication, ÂEcclesia in AfricaÂ certainly gave our Particular Churches much needed impulsion towards active evangelising action in the world of the Media which are more recognised as a cultural world of its own and in need of being evangelised.\n\nTHE CHURCH IN AFRICA HAS CHANGED SINCE THE PROMULGATION OF ECCLESIA IN AFRICA\n\nThe Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation ÂEcclesia in AfricaÂ, came twenty-six years later, in harmonious continuity with the famous phrase pronounced by Pope Paul VI in Rubaga Cathedral, Uganda, on 31 July 1969: ÂBy now, you Africans are missionaries to yourselves. The Church of Christ is well and truly planted on this blessed soil.Â The Pontiff was addressing the closing session of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM).\n\nIn an Address given by the current Chairman of SECAM at Notre Dame University, Indianapolis, on 3 March 2005, we are informed that Âthe African Church itself has taken a new face since 1994...In the ten years between 1994 and 2004...about 65% of the African episcopate has been replaced since our last Synod ten years ago.Â\n\nIn his Address to the Plenary Assembly of SECAM in October, 2300, Cardinal Jan Pieter Schotte made the following pertinent observation:\n\nÂWhile on the one hand, the rapidity of Episcopal renewal is a cause of joy because of the new sap that is flowing in the veins of the episcopal body and the fountain fo youth which it is procuring for it, on the other hand, it implies a certain apprehension, for most of the new Pastors have not fully participated in the Synod. Now the implementation of the resolutions of ÂEcclesia in AfricaÂ require first of all, a change in mentality in order to go beyond ethnic ideologyÂeach Pastor taking pains to act in such a way that each of his faithful feels truly a member in a total capacity of the ChurchÂFamily of GodÂto combat the corruption in society and to encourage civil peace.Â\n\nAt the General Audience on Wednesday, 22 June 2005, the Successor of St. Peter, Benedict XVI, received the Members of the Special Council for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. To all, Pope Benedict XVI said, inter alia:\n\nÂIn a special way, I greet the Members of the Special Council for Africa of the Synod of Bishops who are meeting during these days at the General Secretariat of the Synod. Confirming what my venerable and dear Predecessor, Pope John Paul II, had decided on 13 November last year, I wish to announce my intention to convoke the Second Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for Africa. I have the hope that such an Assembly will give a new impetus to evangelisation on the African Continent, to a consolidation and growth of the Church and to the promotion of reconciliation and peace.Â\n\nThe decision of our Holy Father Pope Benedict XVI, to convoke, in the future, the Second Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for Africa, in harmonious continuity with the First Special Assembly, happily meets the hopes, desires and prayers of the Catholics of the African Continent.\n\n[Integral text - 00123-01.06] [NNNNN] [Testo originale: inglese]\n\n● The Synod of Bishops in its Special Assembly for Lebanon - Special Assembly for Lebanon\n\nH.Exc. Most. Rev. Msg. Cyrille Salim BUSTROS, of the Missionary Society of Saint Paul, Archbishop of Newton, United States of America (Relator General of the synodal Assembly and member of the post-synodal Council)\n\nThe text by the Synodal Father H. Exc. Most Rev. Msg. Cyril Salim Bustros on ÂThe Synod of Bishops in the Special Assembly for LebanonÂ presents a reflection on the outcome of the Assembly gathered around Pope John Paul II in November of 1995, written in the form of a report. Starting with the causes for the conflict between Christians and Muslims that occurred in Beirut in 1975, he shows the reasons for the convocation of the Synodal meeting and the reactions of the Apostolic Exhortation ÂNew Hope for LebanonÂ, promulgated by Pope John Paul II on May 10th 1997. The Apostolic Exhortation by the Holy Father was welcomed by all of Lebanese society, civil and religious. The presence at the Synod of the Orthodox, Protestant and Muslim (Shiite, Sunnite and Druze) Delegations thus witnessed the unity and the spirit of collaboration that Lebanese society must pursue in the spirit of dialogue and conviviality between the religions. Lebanon, John Paul II stated, is more than a nation, it is a message, for the Orient and for the West, of conviviality and of collaboration between the various religions. The report presents, finally, the results of the social changes that emerged from the Synodal reflections and from the encounter between Muslims and Christians.\n\n[Presentation - 00162-02.04] [NNNNN] [Original text: French]\n\n●Fruits of the Synod of America - Special Assembly for America\n\nH. Em. Card. Juan SANDOVAL ÍÑIGUEZ, Archbishop of Guadalajara (Relator General of the synodal Assembly and member of the post-synodal Council)\n\nIn the text by the Synodal Father His Em. Cardinal Juan Sandoval Iñiguez titledÂFruits of the Synod for AmericaÂ, the main aspects of the various phases of the Synod on the theme: ÂEncounter with the Living Jesus Christ, the Way to Conversion, Communion and Solidarity in AmericaÂ, were mentioned, as well as the reflections emerging from it. The Synod, convoked by Pope John Paul II in 1994, in preparation for the Great Jubilee, was celebrated in the Vatican from November 16th to December 12th of 1997. About the preparatory phases of the Synod work, the elements of unity between the two Churches present emerged, the most recent on the United States of America and Canada and the one on South America. The first of these common elements is faith in Christ. During the course of the work of this Synod and afterwards, we can see the rise of mutual respect, of a spirit of collaboration between the parts, the knowledge of the common problems and an exchange of spiritual and material gifts, fruits of the spirit so hoped for by the Synod. Some examples of post-Synodal work were also mentioned, which revealed the will to put into practice the spirit of unity and communion expressed in the Synod. This also deals with the welcoming and the application of the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation, ÂEcclesia in AmericaÂ, signed by Pope John Paul II in 1999. After its publication, all over the Continent, Plenary Assemblies followed, to study pastoral proposals and common projects animated by a spirit of solidarity. Finally, there is a list of some experiences deemed of particular significance, such as the one promoted by the Bishops of the Dioceses at the border between Mexico and the United States, which organized reunions on the migrants.\n\n[Presentation - 00137-02.04] [NNNNN] [Original text: Spanish]\n\n● Some positive results of the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops - Special Assembly for Asia\n\nH. Em. Card. Paul SHAN KUO-HSI, S.I., Bishop of Kaohsiung, (Relator General of the synodal Assembly and member of the post-synodal Council)\n\nFOREWORD\n\nI was asked to present a report on the positive results of the The Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops. To present a brief but also comprehensive report on all the positive results seems difficult, not only because the time given to me is too short, but also because there is a great variety of particular Churches with different Apostolic traditions, liturgies, spiritualities, theological schools, missionary activities, etc., not to mention their socio-economical, geo-political, cultural and racial differences. I choose, therefore, to highlight only some positive results on the following three thological areas, namely Christological, Pneumatological and Ecclesiological for which the Synod Fathers have had special concerns.\n\n1. ON CHRISTOLOGICAL AREA: 'THE UNIQUENESS AND UNIVERSALITY OF SALVATION IN JESUS' (\"Ecclesia in Asia\" n.14)\n\nThis fundamental article of the Christian faith has been challenged in the last decades even by some Christian theologians. They proposed their arguments from two sources. One source is the statistical fact that there are so many great religions, such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity in Asia, except in the Philippines is still a tiny minority after two thousand years of Jesus' birth. Another source is from the Vatican Council II's document\"Lumen Gentium\" (n.16) on the salvation of the non-Christians. Their conclusion from both arguments is that Jesus Christ is not the unique but one of many saviours.\n\nHere is not the proper place to discuss and refute the above mentioned arguments against the uniqueness and universality of salvation in Jesus, but only to present a brief report on the positive result of the Special Assembly in this special Christological area. To my own knowledge, all the particular Churches in Asia under the leadership of their Bishops now are grasping the above mentioned article of doctrine of faith more firmly than before the Special Assembly. And the few people, who provoked the arguments against the article of faith, are keeping quiet either in teaching or in writing.\n\n2. ON PNEUMATOLOGICAL AREA: 'THE SPIRIT IS NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHRIST' (\"ECCLESIA IN ASIA' N.l6)\n\nThe tendency of the above mentioned few people to separate the activity of the Holy Spirit from that of Christ would jeopardize the truth of Jesus as the unique Saviour of all. Most of them who proposed that the Holy Spirit as an alternative to Christ works separately through the other religions for the salvation of people, would like to promote more easily the interreligious dialogue.\n\nIt is not the proper purpose of this paper to discuss and refute the above mentioned tendency, but only to present the positive result of the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops in the Pneumatological area. After the publication of \"Ecclesia in Asia\", at least I have not read any new books or articles contrary to the consensus of the Synod Fathers and teaching of \"Ecclesia in Asia\" in regard to the pneumatological theology.\n\n3. ON ECCLESIASTICAL AREA: 'THE UNION AND UNITY OF TIlE CATHOLIC CHURCH' (\"ECCLESIA IN ASIA\" DO. 24-28)\n\nCommunion and unity are the characteristics of the Catholic Church. But some political powers in Asia assume the very internal affairs of communion and unity of the Catholic Church as their own national affairs. Their main purpose of doing this is to create an \"Independent Church\" modeled on that of the Anglican Church.\n\nThe great concern of the Synod Fathers for the above mentioned danger is reflected very clearly in the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation \"Ecclesia in Asia\" (nn. 24-28). After the publication of \"Ecclesia in Asia\", both the particular Churches and the political powers know very well that the bottomline of the Catholic Church's doctrine of faith on communion and unity cannot be compromised, though the danger is not yet over. But there are signs that the position of the political powers on this area is mitigated as little bit lately.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn a very short time and limited space I have pointed out some positive results of the Special Assembly for Asia of the Synod of Bishops on the above mentioned three theological areas. There are many other positive results in many other areas, such as pastoral, missionary, social, charitable, etc. If you want to know more, you can read my longer report.\n\n[Integral text - 00163-02.06] [NNNNN] [Original text: English]\n\n● The Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for Oceania - Special Assembly for Oceania H.Exc. Most. Rev. Msg. John Atcherley DEW, Archbishop of Wellington (Member of the Special Assembly) read the text of Cardinal Thomas S. Williams, Archbishop Emeritus of Wellington (President Delegate of the Special Assembly)\n\nCardinal Jozef Tomko, the President of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses, begins his report with an introduction, giving his experiences pertaining to the Synod of Bishops and his participation in the various Synods of the past. He then continues with various points about the Synod of Bishops, which was instituted by Paul VI with the motu proprio ÂApostolica sollicitudoÂ. Later, John Paul II consolidated the autonomy and increased the authority and collegiality of the Synod. The Synod of Bishops was instituted as a Âpermanent council of Bishops for the Universal ChurchÂ, subject directly to the Pope and has its nature as a natural ecclesiastic institution, representing all the Catholic Episcopacy, and perpetual by nature. The finalities are to give information and advice; and may deliberate on certain matters, with the Roman Pontiff ratifying the SynodÂs decisions. The theological foundation of the Synod of Bishops can be found in the unity of the Church expressed by the life of communion of the local churches and the collegiality between all the Bishops (communio et collegialitas).The Synod of Bishops represents the Catholic Episcopacy in the whole world in a moral and manifest way, its decisions are consultive and may become deliberative only by mandate of the Supreme Pontiff. As for the consulting aspect of the Synod of Bishops, John Paul II goes beyond the formal and juridical aspects of the Synod vote and places it in the context of the Church as an organism of communion of faith. In conclusion, Cardinal Tomko compares the Synod of Bishops to a heart, a marvelous ecclesial osmosis that has been going on for the past forty years.\n\n[Presentation - 00164-02.04] [NNNNN] [Original text: Italian]\n\n● II Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops - I and II Special Assemblies for Europe\n\nH. Em. Card. Antonio María ROUCO VARELA, Archbishop of Madrid (Relator General of the II Special Assembly and member of the post-synodal Council)\n\nHis Em. Cardinal Rouco Varela speaks about the Special Assembly for Europe II of the Synod of Bishops, on the theme: ÂJesus Christ, Alive in His Church, the Source of Hope for EuropeÂ, which took place in the Vatican from October 1st to the 23rd 1999. He was the General Relator and stated that Âit was an authentic event of the ChurchÂ, underlining the opportunity that would have allowed the reflection on the situation in Europe, almost an examination of the conscience, which the celebration of the Great Jubilee for the Year 2000 had invited the whole Catholic Church.\n\nThe 288 participants, of all ages and coming from all the European countries, all spoke the languages of Europe, coming from the most diverse situations, more than half of them had never been a part of a Synodal Assembly and did not know each other. Yet this did not stop them from\n\nfinding a renewed and tangible Catholic unity, Cardinal Varela underlined, as well as a harmony on the diagnosis of the European situation in which, after the geo-political reunification, was possible to better perceive the spiritual damages caused by the immanent humanism in its different ideological versions. Therefore, being Âthe hour of truth for Europe, this was the right time for the Hour of the Gospel... the hour for the renewed proclamation of the kerygmaÂ and, on this point, the conviction of the Synodal Fathers was clear and full of hope. Even in Europe there was the need to start again from the beginning, from an essential and clear proposal of the Mystery of Christ. The fact that the sacramental life of the Church is, in part, inseparable from new evangelization was also underlined, because Christian life emerges from the Eucharist and from the other sacraments.\n\nThe new evangelization, Cardinal Varela continues, has its instruments and its style: dialogue. Dialogue with culture and society through adequate institutions such as schools and Universities, the health and political institutions, those for aide, ecumenical dialogue between the different Christian professions, in particular the need for mutual understanding and charity between the Catholics and the Orthodox, dialogue between the new movements and the ecclesial communities as instruments that the Holy Spirit gave to the Church for the new evangelization and the old institutions and all were invited to communion with the Bishop in the local Church.\n\nCardinal Varela concluded by asserting that Old Europe was expecting words for the future and hope and that the Synod of 1999 and the Apostolic Exhortation ÂEcclesia in EuropaÂ, signed by John Paul II on June 28th 2003, answered with a proposal and an appealÂ Jesus Christ and conversion to the One who has the Word of Eternal Life.\n\n[Presentation - 00136-02.03] [NNNNN] [Original text: Spanish]"
