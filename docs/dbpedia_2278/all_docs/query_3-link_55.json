        "text": "Views\n\nNkuv Affair\n\nArchbishop Esua expressed his full intentions as Chief Pastor to advocate doctrinal views on issues like the Nkuv Affair. Quite a good number of the prominent members of the World Apostolate of Fatima (The Blue Army) became ring leaders of the unorthodox Nkuv devotion, since the latter was in some wishful and unclear manner associated with the Fatima apparitions. lieutenant was on account of this association that the 13th of every month, and most especially the 13th of May, was taken as the official day of prayer for the Nkuvites.\n\nSince the 7th of October 1997, when Archbishop Esua, then Bishop of Kumbo Diocese issued a Pastoral Letter declaring the falsehood and unorthodoxy of the Nkuv Affair and outlining the criteria for determining the authenticity of Marian apparitions, some of its adherents have withdrawn and regained full communion with the Local Church, some adhere both to Nkuv and to the Church, and some have publicly excluded themselves from the Church and pledged allegiance to Nkuv, forming what we can now refer to as a section However, the group is gradually dying out.\n\nOn the Sacrament of Marriage and Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\n\nArchbishop Esua and the other Bishops of the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province (BAPEC), issued a letter to all Christian Faithful concerning the Sacrament of Marriage and Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. All the Bishops requested that before the Publication of Marriage banns, couples must present to the Parish Priest a valid and authentic medical certificate showing that they have done the Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome screening. While the Church continues to educate people on how Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome can be prevented from spreading into the society, the Bishops reiterated the Church stand on the Matter.\n\nThe Church does not allow or advocate the use of condoms as a way of preventing the spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The Church\"s solution is Chastity for those who are not Married, Fidelity to one\"s partner for married couples who are not infected and Abstinence from sexual intercourse for married couples if at least one partner is infected."
