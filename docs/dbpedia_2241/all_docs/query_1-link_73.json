        "text": "â€” A former Arkansas State Police sergeant who now is a Faulkner County justice of the peace said he submitted his own DNA under a fictitious name in 2000 as part of an investigation into the still-unsolved 1990 rape and beating death of a Greenbrier woman.\n\nJerry Roberts said he used a cigarette to turn in his own DNA rather than that of his then-ailing brother, who owned a business beside the video store where victim Pamela Faye Felkins worked.\n\nAuthorities said Roberts' brother, Ed Roberts, was not a serious suspect, but they needed to rule him out because he worked so closely to Felkins. Ed Roberts later submitted his own DNA and was officially cleared.\n\nRoberts, who said he retired from the state police in November 2001, defended his actions in interviews Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"I did what I thought was best at the time, and it was legal in an effort to pursue the truth,\" Roberts said. \"I still think it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nBut Faulkner County Sheriff Karl Byrd said Roberts' actions were improper and hurt the investigation.\n\n\"It created a defense\" for anyone who might ever be charged in the crime, said Byrd, who became sheriff in January 2007. \"The defense can use it now,\" posing the question of, \"If you tainted that, what elsewould you have tainted?\"\n\nByrd is a Democrat planning to seek re-election. Roberts is a Republican who announced Tuesday that he has formed an exploratory committee to see if there is support for him to run for sheriff.\n\nByrd has been a target of Roberts' criticism since 2008, both over sheriff's office funding and the Felkins investigation.\n\nH.G. Foster, who was the prosecutor in Faulkner County in 2000 and now works for the Arkansas Office of the Prosecutor Coordinator, said Friday that he had \"heard the rumor\" about Roberts' actions but had not known it to be fact.\n\nFoster declined comment on Roberts' actions but said in general, \"Anytime anybody involved in a criminal investigation puts something down that isn't true or says something that isn't true, No. 1, it's a bad thing, and No. 2, it absolutely can cause huge problems in the actual resolution of the case and any subsequent prosecution.\"\n\nAsked if it is illegal to submit DNA under a fictitious name, Foster said, \"It would depend on the circumstances. ... It has to be addressed in the context of what you're doing.\"\n\nJack McQuary, who works with the coordinator's office and was asked in June by Prosecuting Attorney Marcus Vaden to assist in the Felkins investigation, said he and Vaden \"did not care to comment on [Roberts'] actions.\"\n\nMcQuary said they want \"to protect the integrity of the investigation.\"\n\nRick Gallagher, assistant director of the state Crime Laboratory, said it is not that office's place to say if the use of a fictitious name on a DNA sample is legal or justified. He said his office takes the information provided by authorities and deals only with science.\n\nRoberts said he submitted his DNA \"to pursue the truth,\" to \"protect the innocent\" - his brother - and to prevent the task force from breaking up over anger if they learned that member Bobby Brown had asked Roberts to get a DNA sample from Ed Roberts.\n\nRoberts, who was chairman of a multiagency task force investigating the Felkins murder, said Brown \"came up with this idea about doing this [fictitious name] deal\" for the DNA when they were in a smoking area of the sheriff's office in 2000.\n\n\"He suggested we could send mine under\" a fictitious name, which Roberts said he subsequently made up himself.\n\nRoberts said he noticed then-Sheriff Marty Montgomery nearby and asked Montgomery his opinion. \"And Marty said, 'Yeah, I think that would be the best way to handle it,'\" Roberts added.\n\nBrown, now a jail administrator and sheriff's office major, and Montgomery, now director of the Arkansas State Hospital's police department, disputed Roberts' account.\n\n\"We didn't agree to nothing like that. That was all him,\" said Brown, who is no longer involved in the Felkins investigation.\n\nRoberts said he placed a cigarette he had smoked inside a brown envelope as Montgomery watched.\n\n\"I licked the envelope. I sealed it. I put my fingerprints all over it. I wrote on the back\" the fictitious Hispanic name and put the date of birth as 9-16-51, with each number being one lower than Roberts' own date of birth, 10-17-52, Roberts said.\n\nRoberts said he made sure his DNA and fingerprints were on the envelope because he feared Brown might move the DNA sample to another envelope and put Ed Roberts' name on it.\n\nThen, Roberts said, \"it would have looked like I was trying to protect [a] guilty person. So, I covered that by having the sheriff witness it. ... My DNA would not have been on the seal\" if Brown had switched the envelope.\n\nRoberts said he gave the envelope to Brown to submit to the Crime Lab.\n\nExperts can use a sibling's DNA to determine if a sample is a close match, Montgomery noted.\n\n\"If he [Roberts] had submitted it under his own name, that would have been the best thing and something I would have recommended\" due to the illness of Roberts' brother, Montgomery said. But Montgomery said he never agreed to putting a fictitious name on the sample.\n\n\"That is not something you do on any investigation,\" he said. \"It makes it appear you're trying to cover something up.\"\n\nBrown said he didn't know Roberts had submitted his ownDNA until after results showed the sample did not match DNA from the Felkins crime.\n\nBrown said he had asked Roberts to get the brother's DNA and that Robertsagreed. \"Jerry didn't want to make his brother mad,\" Brown said. \"So, he was just going to get one of his [brother's] cigarette butts and submit it.\"\n\nBrown said he later was taking other DNA samples to the Crime Lab and asked Roberts where his brother's sample was.\n\n\"He said, 'I submitted that already,'\" Brown said Friday. \"I said, 'No, you didn't.' He said, 'I used an alias, which was a Hispanic name.' And then that really kind of upset me because you're submitting evidence to the Crime Lab that's not true. ... Later, he said he did not submit his brother's DNA but his own.He said it's in the same gene family.\"\n\nBrown said, \"I think my feelings on that [at the time] were why would somebody do something so stupid that would mess up the case. ... Short of getting a confession, you won't ever get a conviction. ... If I was a [defense] attorney, I would jump on this for free.\"\n\nBrown said he believes Roberts, who no longer is on the task force, could have continued to keep the truth from officials if the DNA sample had come back a match.\n\n\"That would have been a scientific impossibility,\" Roberts countered, since it would have meant he killed Felkins, and he said he did not.\n\nBut Byrd said, \"There are so many improper implications that could have resulted from what [Roberts] did, it is amazing.\"\n\nIt could have messed up another person's life had there been a DNA match and a person with that fictitious name and the stated date of birth, Byrd said.\n\nRoberts disagreed. \"There's no way anybody could have been harmed by this,\" he said. \"If it would have turned up that they could not clear [the fictitious name], I would have went to my brother and we wouldhave got his DNA and submitted it.\"\n\nRoberts said his brother didn't know about the matter at the time.\n\nByrd said the brother was \"extremely cooperative\" when he later asked him for a sample.\n\nRoberts said he told Byrd what he had done in 2001 after Byrd - then a state police investigator - was assigned to Faulkner County.\n\nRoberts said Brown, Byrd, Vaden and Foster are involved in a cover-up to protect the personRoberts believes killed Felkins.\n\nFoster said cover-up allegations are \"standard fare\" against elected prosecutors and that he had confidence in the prosecutor's office then and now. Byrd and Brown denied being part of a cover-up.\n\nByrd said Roberts \"has thrown things out there that have hurt the integrity of the case. He has done everything under the sun, and it's all for political gain.\"\n\nBut Roberts said he has \"a moral obligation\" to run forsheriff because that is the only way Felkins-case evidence - including a bloody mattress he said was found in 2000 - will be handled properly and sent to the state.\n\nHe also wants to oppose corruption in other cases, he said.\n\nByrd declined to discuss specific evidence but said, \"Apparently previous investigators decided [the mattress] shouldn't have been sent there. [Roberts] had every bit of power to send it [to the state]\" when he was taskforce chairman but didn't."
