        "text": "Boulder County Assessor Jerry Roberts is resigning effective Jan. 25.\n\n“I have not come to this decision lightly, but personal responsibilities involving my family have made this decision necessary,” Roberts wrote to Boulder County commissioners, who will appoint his successor.\n\nRoberts said in a Wednesday interview that that will include helping care for his 92-year-old mother, who lives with Roberts and his wife, Lorri Park.\n\nHis current term as assessor, an elected county government position, wouldn’t conclude until the end of 2018. His January retirement will create a vacancy the commissioners will have to fill by appointing someone to fill that post for the coming two years.\n\nRoberts has recommended that the commissioners name his chief deputy, Cindy Braddock, to be his successor.\n\nRoberts, a Boulder Democrat, was himself appointed assessor in July 2007 to fill a vacancy created when his predecessor, Cindy Domenico, left the assessor’s office to become a Boulder County commissioner.\n\nRoberts won a November 2010 election to stay in the assessor’s post for the remainder of Domenico’s term as assessor. He then won re-election to the post in 2010 and 2014 and could have run for a final, full four-year term in November 2018.\n\nRoberts, who’s worked in one capacity or another in the Boulder County Assessor’s Office for 36 years, was Domenico’s chief deputy assessor prior to the county commissioners’ July 2007 appointment to head the office.\n\n“We worked together for a long time,” Domenico said Wednesday. “I’ve always considered him a dear friend and a mentor.”\n\nDomenico said Roberts has been “a very thoughtful and positive person in a tough job.”\n\nThe county assessor’s office appraises the values of real estate, with the assigned values then becoming the basis of the owners’ local property taxes.\n\nRoberts said in his letter to the county commissioners that the office “is responsible for” assessing “over 118,000 properties, including residential, highly complex commercial properties, vacant land, agricultural and business personal property.\n\n“It is important that the leader that replaces me have an understanding of the state statutes, the certification process, mass appraisal methods, as well as the challenges of the appeals process and the licensing requirements our appraisers must adhere to in their positions,” he wrote.\n\nHe said that’s why he was recommending that Braddock be appointed assessor."
