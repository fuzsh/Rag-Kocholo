        "text": "The Massachusetts Minutemen have been hard at work recruiting the Transfer Portal this off-season and while they have identified numerous targets for their board, given the fluid nature of transfers with the Portal sometimes a player becomes available unexpectedly and you have to react accordingly. That was certainly the case with former Arizona linebacker Jerry Roberts, who just committed to the Minutemen off his recent official visit to Amherst:\n\nRoberts had initially decided to stay in Tucson and use his NCAA-granted seventh season with the Wildcats but a change with the coaching staff had Roberts reevaluating his options. He entered the Portal and was promptly offered by UMass and Don Brown & Keith Dudzinski, his former defensive coaches with UA and he didn't take long to decide that playing for them once again was his preferred option.\n\nRoberts is also the older brother of 2023 UMass signee Jyree Roberts, also a Mike linebacker, and the chance to play with his brother was the icing on the cake when he told us why UMass was the move for him following his commitment.\n\n\"The campus and coaching staff were amazing,\" Roberts said. \"After playing for Coach Brown at Arizona I felt as if it was the right fit, especially playing in a defense of his caliber. So I thought 'why not?' and I get another chance to play for him in a top notch defense again. Also with my little brother attending UMass I thought it would be a great thing to teach him and lead him in the right path. Especially with me trying to make it to the NFL and him trying to become a starter on the field.\"\n\nRoberts' 78 tackles were second on the Wildcats last season (their leader had 79) and his old-school MLB mentality translates to the field in everything he does.\n\n\"I bring an aggressive. true Mike linebacker attitude as a downhill run stopper,\" Roberts said. \"I'm great in pass coverage, able to recognize offensive schemes and tendencies. Also I'm a vocal leader whether it’s practice or a game; a true leader of the defense, running the show.\"\n\nRoberts will be enrolling this month with UMass and he is looking forward to getting started and getting back to campus, a place that really impressed him on his official visit earlier this month.\n\n\"What stood out to me [on the visit] were that facilities are top notch,\" Roberts said. \"Quite frankly better than some Power 5 programs. Also the surrounding area that was within a 15-20 minute radius was extremely nice environment-wise. The campus was huge and new. As far as the staff, they treated me as family. It felt as if I've known them my whole life. With the coaching experience we have I can’t wait to experience a great season under them.\"\n\nJerry's opportunity to play with Jyree was a major factor for him, and he really wants to set his brother on the right path, similar to his own, ideally with a degree and a shot at the pros at the end of it.\n\n\"Getting a chance to play with your younger brother is amazing,\" Roberts said. \"It’s like who wouldn’t want a chance to teach their younger sibling the game inside and out, helping him perfect his craft but also learning from him as well. But this also makes it a lot easier for my family to come watch some games since we both are here.\"\n\nRoberts' veteran leadership and experience will be huge for UMass in 2023 as they look to take their next step forward under Brown and his staff. Roberts can't wait for Minutemen fans to see what he and the defense can do for this program next season.\n\n\"[UMass fans] are going to get an outgoing, fun to be around and energetic person,\" Roberts said. \"I come ready to work and compete every single day. I’m all for the fans and making sure they have a great experience with the players, so if you see me on campus don’t hesitate to say 'hi' either.\"\n\nAdding Roberts late in the Portal window really ended up as a coup for UMass. They get a veteran Power 5 starter for his final season and he can step right into the role that Jalen Mackie filled last season. The family and coaching connections made it happen and sometimes you need those things in order to grab a player you might not otherwise have gotten.\n\nThat's some good fortune for UMass which they haven't always had in recruiting but they certainly weren't going to let it go past them this time. Roberts can be a game-changer for a defense that already took a significant step forward last season under Brown and Dudzinski. He is an old-school 'backer and that is something UMass will always need anchoring the middle of their defense. He can also be invaluable to not only his younger brother but other young LBs like Tyler Martin who can have another season learning from a seasoned veteran.\n\nUMass has done a very good job recruiting the Portal this cycle and it shows in the talent they've accrued. Roberts may only have one season left but he is going to be going all-out with his goal of making the pros on the horizon. He'll be a motivated leader for the Minutemen and they should all look to follow his example."
