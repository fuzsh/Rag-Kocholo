        "text": "üåü Impressive Digital Day in Rotkreuz! üåü I had the privilege of attending the Digital Day in Rotkreuz this week, and I must say, it was an incredible experience! The program was complete, and the schedule was well-organized. Digital Day 2024 at Rotkreuz was an inspiring gathering of industry leaders, experts, and enthusiasts. We explored the latest trends, technologies, and opportunities to leverage the power of digital in our ever-evolving world. The event moderated by amazing Dr. Heiko Visarius featured engaging keynotes, interactive activities, and insightful sessions: One of the highlights was the keynote by Prof. em. Dr. rer. nat. Lutz J√§ncke from the University of Zurich. His insights into the transition from the Stone Age to the digital world were truly fascinating. Another captivating keynote focused on the future of Oncology Care. Matthias Bodmer , Healthcare Solutions Lead. We also had the pleasure of hearing from Paul Strijbos, Senior Principal Neurotech Innovation Leader, who discussed the development and use of fit-for-purpose digital health technology. If this topic sparks your interest, be sure to stay tuned for more information. Last but not least, Dr. Caroline Lustenberger from ETHZ and Herencia delivered a captivating keynote on Sleep Research and its applications in Alzheimer's and Cardiovascular diseases. If this piques your curiosity, you can find more details on our program subsite. One highlight was the presence of Thomas H. Zurbuchen , Ex NASA Associate Administrator, who shared invaluable lessons on navigating high-risk environments and drawing parallels between space exploration and healthcare advancements. üåå The focus and concept of the Digital Day were truly inspiring. We are in a time where digital technology is evolving rapidly, and by discussing these topics, we are paving the way for innovative solutions. It's an opportunity to make a digital impact, upskill ourselves, and create value for Roche. #DigitalDay2024 #DigitalInnovation #RocheImpact #DigitalDay #Innovation #Roche #Networking #Rotkreuz\n\nAs we orbit into a new year, we reflect on the incredible journey we've travelled together. üåüSome of the Past Year's Highlights: üí†The historic size of the Slovak Space Ecosystem: the largest-ever space ecosystem in Slovakia, with growing engagement and interest in European & international collaboration. üí†Emerging Space Conference & European Industry Summit: Bringing together hundreds of professionals from around the world, particularly advancing collaboration between the emerging and well-established space ecosystems of Europe. üí†Spaceport Incubator: The successful 2nd batch of our incubation program led to the creation of seven innovative projects.

In the spirit of renewal and growth, as a \"disruptor and visionary\" as I've been called lately (yes, I'm taking on these titles as a badge of honour! üòÅ), I'm thrilled to share that alongside celebrating the Lunar New Year, we're also embarking on a journey of transformation in healthcare. Just as the dragon symbolizes vitality and resilience, our commitment to revolutionizing healthcare, echoes these qualities. üöÄ Today, we're not just marking a new lunar cycle; we're also training our very own \"healthcare dragon\" ‚Äì a metaphor for our dedication to innovation, collaboration, and excellence in healthcare information management. Just like taming a dragon requires skill, patience, and courage, navigating the complexities of healthcare demands a similar approach. Together, we're cultivating a culture of continuous learning and improvement, where every challenge is an opportunity to soar to new heights. Whether it's embracing cutting-edge technologies, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, or championing patient-centric care, our aim is clear: to empower individuals and communities to lead healthier, happier lives. üåü MY911 Inc. (Canada) wishes you a new year of amazing health, prosperity, good fortune, and boundless possibilities! #LunarNewYear #YearOfTheDragon #HealthcareInnovation #Transformation #Empowerment #awareness #peaceofmind #convenience #emergencypreparedness #healthfirst\n\nTo celebrate the Lunar New Year, we've asked a couple of teammates to share their traditions with us, namely, Natalie Lam and Anastasia Krecklow. Natalie, Senior Analyst of Investments, explains, \"The day consists of everyone passing around red envelopes to spread good luck and fortune. Typically, the whole family wears red to represent good fortune and success. Family traditions consist of eating vegetarian food, holding a tea ceremony for parents and grandparents, and spending the evening enjoying each other‚Äôs company.\" Anastasia, District Team Lead, recounts, \"Ukrainians have a lot of superstitious beliefs about what actions bring luck to our lives and what actions can scare luck away. We always know the lunar symbols of the upcoming year. Modern Ukrainians believe having an item associated with the Lunar New Year animal will bring good luck to their homes.\" Read more: https://lnkd.in/gyJtrTyE Will you be celebrating the Lunar New Year?

It was interesting to hear from experts what the (current) key criteria are to create a successful life sciences cluster, including: access to teaching hospitals, academia, research institutions, transport links, affordable housing, power (and backup power) supply. The need for investment into the wider infrastructure for the players in UK life sciences to thrive is clearly a hot topic and it will be interesting to see what the new Labour government can promise (and deliver!) to encourage this. Some other key takeaways from the event: the influence of AI and data centres on the advances of UK life sciences and tech will be huge; it‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúlocation location location‚Äù but more like ‚Äúinfrastructure infrastructure infrastructure‚Äù with a growing interest in areas outside the golden triangle (so don‚Äôt ignore the corridors that link Oxford and Cambridge to London); UK life sciences players need space - space to grow into, space to store, space to collaborate; and the main theme of the day was flexibility at all levels, from incubators to developers to landlords to investors, this is a growing and changing industry and what was important to occupiers even two years ago is different today. There is a real need for connection and collaboration within UK life sciences and tech to create thriving ecosystems.\n\nWhat a great way to start the week, with the huge privilege of attending and speaking at the Health from Space conference in Cannes, France.
