        "text": "Gladys School, age 85, passed away surrounded by her loving family on Wednesday, April 11, 2007, at Brewster Village in Appleton. She was born in Wrightstown on February 20, 1922, daughter of the late George and Marie (Verbeten) Lamers. She married Paul T. School on February 8, 1944 in Wrightstown; he preceded her in death in June of 2006. The couple lived in Hollandtown for most of their married life, moving to their current home in 1947. Gladys was a member of St. Francis Catholic Church in Hollandtown. In her younger years, she worked as a staff writer for the DePere Journal, and was also a member of the Urban Klister Post #436 of the American Legion Auxiliary in Wrightstown.\n\nGladys was a daughter, sister, loving wife and mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and maker of a home extraordinaire. She was a woman who could truly ‚Äúbake‚Äù someone happy.\n\nSurvivors include four daughters: Sandy VandeLoo of Eau Claire and her special friend Jack; Lois (Mark) Brown of Kaukauna; Peg (John) Roberts of Oregon, Wisconsin; and Paula (Alex) Zarenko of Gibsonia, Pennsylvania; two sons: Jim (Theresa) School of Menasha and Mike (Wendy) School of Chippewa Falls; ten grandchildren: Laurie (Todd) Edelman, Rick (Sarah) VandeLoo, Michael VandeLoo, Jody Bangart and his fianc√©e Diane, Jill Hegy, Becky (Mike) Dreyer, Jerry Roberts, David Roberts, Kristina Zarenko, and Eric Zarenko; a step-granddaughter: Kendra Tolliver; eleven great-grandchildren: Emily, Megan, and Abby Edelman; Sam, Alex, and Noah VandeLoo; Marissa, Alix, Kinsey, and Tyler Hegy; and Trinity Dreyer. Gladys is also survived by five sisters: Judy Schaeuble of Kaukauna, Isabelle Brochtrup of Little Chute, Toni (Dan) Vander Loop of Kaukauna, Betty (John) Maney of Texas, and Ruth (Jerry) Gerhartz of Racine; several of Paul‚Äôs brothers and sisters: Eleanor Oppelt, Rita (Roland) VandeHey, Louis (Arlene) School, Bob (Elaine) School, and Art (Marie) School; as well as many wonderful nieces and nephews on both sides of the family. Gladys was preceded in death by her parents, her husband Paul, her son Jerry, brothers Robert Lamers and Roy (Mildred) Lamers, brothers-in-law Pat Schaeuble, Roland Brochtrup, Howard (Evelyn) School, John Oppelt, Roy Potter, and Raymond Micke; two sisters-in-law: Ardie School and Florence (Stan) Budzinski; and nephews Nicholas Micke and Terry Schaeuble.\n\nThe funeral liturgy for Gladys will be held at 10:00 AM on Monday, April 16, 2007 at ST. FRANCIS CATHOLIC CHURCH in Hollandtown, with Fr. Bill VandeLoo officiating. Interment will follow in the parish cemetery. Friends may call at the funeral home on Sunday from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM and again Monday morning at the church from 9:00 AM until 10:00 AM. There will be an American Legion Auxiliary service at 4:45 PM Sunday at the funeral home and a parish prayer and scripture service at 5:00 PM.\n\nThe entire staff of caregivers at Brewster Village provided excellent and compassionate care. We thank each of you. Thanks also to Deborah Schultz, Gladys‚Äô physician, who was simply amazing. The family also extends their gratitude to the many special friends and neighbors who cared for both Paul and Gladys over the years. Your kindness will never be forgotten by our family.\n\nGladys was a warm and generous woman whose home was always open to family and friends. No one was a stranger to her. She will be remembered as a fun-loving woman who also enjoyed making a little mischief from time to time! Mom loved playing a good hand of Rummy with anyone who dared to take her on. She was a huge part of our lives and we will never stop missing her."
