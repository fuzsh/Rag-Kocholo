Jerry and Terry Roberts are one year apart, and growing up, they played at different levels of the Bay City League.

Now at Cathedral Prep, the Roberts cousins are making big plays for the Ramblers' defense.

"We've grown up playing football since we were six years old," Jerry Roberts said. "My dad has always coached me and his name is Jerry also. Terry's dad is also Terry, and it's great to have a cousin on the field with me. He had a big interception against Bishop McDevitt and I said, 'There goes my little cousin doing his thing.' "

The two will get one more year together as Jerry is a junior linebacker and Terry is a sophomore defensive back, but the two are looking to help Cathedral Prep win its third state championship Friday at 7 p.m. against Philadelphia powerhouse Imhotep Charter.

"It's great to have them on the team," Prep coach Mike Mischler said about Jerry and Terry Roberts. "We have Jerry Roberts Sr. (assistant defensive line coach) on staff, and Jerry's defensive performance as a linebacker has been spectacular this year. He's one of the all-time leading tacklers for a single season in school history, and he's unselfish. We moved him to outside linebacker, and he's done things that some of our other guys can't. That's made a huge difference on the defense."

Jerry Roberts has 111 tackles this season, including 13 for a loss. He has three sacks, two interceptions and one forced fumble. Jerry Roberts is sixth in Prep history in tackles and could pass Jake Plonski (2012) and Jim Scharrer (1992), who have 118 and 119 tackles, respectively, with one more big performance Friday.

Terry Roberts, who rotates into the secondary, has four interceptions this season, including two of the biggest plays of the year.

He grabbed a momentum-changing interception against Conneaut in the District 10 Class AAA championship before picking off a pass in the final minutes of the PIAA semifinals against Bishop McDevitt to prevent the potentially game-winning touchdown.

"It's been great having my cousin out there because he's there to motivate me and push me," Terry Roberts said. "When I get down, he tells me to forget it and keep playing hard. Against McDevitt, I knew they were coming my way because they had trips (three receivers) on one side and I was lined up with Kobay White on the other side. I met the quarterback eye-to-eye and was able to make the play."

The two also have a cousin on offense in starting senior wide receiver Koran Williams and relatives in Sidney and Malano Jones.

- Prep will host a send-off Thursday at 9:30 a.m. in the H. David Bowes Auditorium. The Ramblers will conduct a walkthrough at State College High School at 3 p.m. Thursday before having a final walkthrough Friday at 11:30 a.m. at Bishop McDevitt High School. Prep and Imhotep Charter will kick off Friday at 7 p.m. at HersheyPark Stadium.

- Farrell's send-off is scheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m. The Steelers will take on Bishop Guilfoyle at 1 p.m. Friday in Hershey for the PIAA Class A championship.

Bishop Guilfoyle is on a 31-game winning streak, including a 19-18 upset of powerhouse Clairton in the 2014 state championship game.

- Imhotep Charter is returning to Hershey for the first time since 2013. The Panthers were routed by WPIAL champion South Fayette 41-0 in the Class AA championship before moving up to Class AAA last fall. Imhotep Charter was beaten by eventual state champion Archbishop Wood 42-34 in the District 12 championship in 2014.

- District 10 will send two teams to the PIAA football championships in the same year for the third time.

In 1991, Cathedral Prep and Strong Vincent each played for a state title but at different sites. Strong Vincent defeated Conestoga Valley 29-20 in the Class AAA game at Lackawanna County Stadium. Prep lost to Central Bucks West 26-14 in the Class AAAA game at Mansion Park in Altoona.

D-10 also had two teams compete for state titles in 2006 and both were at Hersheypark Stadium.

General McLane won the Class AAA game over Pottsville, 28-23, while West Middlesex lost 56-14 in the Class A game to Southern Columbia.

- Bishop McDevitt quarterback Tayvon Bowers had a big game Friday with 352 passing yards. It is the second-most passing yards allowed in one game in Prep history, according to school historian Dan Brabender. The record is 375 passing yards in 2003 by St. Ignatius quarterback Brian Hoyer, who is now with the Houston Texans.

Bryce Hall, a Virginia recruit, became the first 200-yard receiver against Prep with 219 yards. The previous record was 175 yards by David Ferris of St. Francis (N.Y.) in 2001.
