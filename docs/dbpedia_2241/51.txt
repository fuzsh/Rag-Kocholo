Raymond "Jerry" Roberts - one of the last of a top World War Two codebreaking team at Bletchley Park - has died, aged 93, following a short illness.

Capt Roberts, from Liphook, Hampshire, was part of a group that cracked the German High Command's Tunny code at the British codebreaking centre.

Their decrypts made it possible to read Hitler's own messages during the war.

The team is credited with helping to shorten the war by at least two years.

Capt Roberts joined Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, as a German linguist and was among four founder members of the Testery section - named after its head Ralph Tester.

Their target was to crack a system known as Tunny, which carried the messages of Hitler's top generals and even the Fuhrer himself.

The system used four times as many encryption wheels as the famous Enigma machine - which carried military communications.

Reminiscing years after WW2 - when he could finally talk about his work - Capt Roberts said he had taken delight in reading Hitler's messages, sometimes even before the intended recipient.

He described the intelligence the team had gathered as "gold dust" in a 2013 BBC interview.

"We were breaking 90% of the German traffic through '41 to '45", Capt Roberts recalled in one interview.

"We worked for three years on Tunny material and were breaking - at a conservative estimate - just under 64,000 top-line messages."

He added it had been "an exciting time" whenever the team "started getting a break on a message and seeing it through".
