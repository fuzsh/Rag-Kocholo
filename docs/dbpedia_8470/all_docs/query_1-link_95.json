But while Montaigne always moves forward, Florio winds back on himself and scrunches his sentences into ever tighter baroque spirals until their meaning disappears in a puff of syntax. The real magic happens when the two writers meet. Montaigne's earthiness holds Florio's convolutions in check, while Florio gives Montaigne an Elizabethan English quality, as well as a lot of sheer fun.\n\n—Sarah Bakewell, How to Live, or, A Life of Montaigne\n\n[Montaigne] was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man.\n\n—William Hazlitt\n\nThat such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on Earth.\n\n—Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nMontaigne is the frankest and honestest of all writers.\n\n—Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nI defy any reader of Montaigne not to put down the book at some point and say with incredulity: \"How did he know all that about me?\"\n\n—Bernard Levin, The Times (London)\n\nSo much have I made him my own, that it seems he is my very self.\n\n—Andre Gide\n\nHere is a 'you' in which 'I' is reflected; here is where all distance is abolished.\n\n—Stefan Zweig\n\nIt is not in Montaigne but in myself that I find everything I see there.\n\n—Blaise Pascal"
