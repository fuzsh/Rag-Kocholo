        "text": "Click here to read part one to learn about who and what influenced Pascal’s thought!\n\nClick here to read part two on Pascal’s thought regarding happiness, contingency, and paradox!\n\nIn my opinion, Pascal qua existentialist is most clear and insightful when he deals with the themes of death and boredom—two ideas that are inextricably linked for him, as for Heidegger. Personally, this is where I find his thinking to be the best. One aphorism opens with the phrase “Fascinatio nugacitatis,” which translates to something like “a fascination with triviality,” where he continues, “That passion may not harm us, let us act as if we had only eight hours to live” (§203). The idea expressed here is not new or original; it has been said time again by countless thinkers, that we should live as though it were our last day, etc. But what is essential here is the underlying assumption: When we are cognizant of death, Pascal assumes we will no longer be swayed by our emotions, but will instantly see what is important. As soon as we become aware of our mortality, we will drop everything not worth our time. Death brings us lucidity, it makes us see things clearer: No longer will we be “fascinated with triviality.” We will “wake up” to life.\n\nDeath is what individuates us. Like a knife, death excises everything but ourselves, so that only we—our innermost depths—remain. “We are fools to depend on the society of our fellow-men,” Pascal mutters, “We shall die alone” (§211). When our day comes, even if we are surrounded by friends and family, it is we who have to say goodbye, ultimately. Whether alone or in company, we are always existentially isolated; we are trapped within this body of ourselves, unable to reach out, to stand outside ourselves. We may touch, we may empathize, but we can never really connect with someone. What are other people going to do? They may postpone death through medical intervention, but death will come anyway, not just to us, but to them, too. What Pascal is getting at, is that everyone will die, and nobody can help that. It may be more comforting to be with others, but that will not change the fact of the matter. As Heidegger will say, my death is mine alone. What is not said explicitly by Pascal will be said later on by Heidegger, which is that the reason we do not fear death is because we de-individuate it, because we do not believe it will happen to us, because we only ever see it happen to others; death just becomes a subject of talk, but nothing real in itself.\n\nHowever, this is abstract, and, in fact, Pascal went further than Heidegger ever would in this regard: “Diversion.—As men are not able to fight against death, misery, ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy, not to think of them at all” (§168). The psychologist in Pascal shines through here. Our avoidance of the thought of death stems from our abhorrence to it. Death is a dreadful thing about which to think, it is painful, it is discomforting; therefore, we need to repress it, to push it back, to close the curtains on it, that we may stay safe and secluded within the comfort of everyday life. We shut the doors on death to keep it out, so to speak. How specifically? As Pascal indicates: Through diversion.\n\nWe need to take some time to truly appreciate this diagnosis of Pascal’s. Diversion—the French term used in the Pensées is “divertissement,” which still happens to carry itself over into English as its own word. When I hear the word diversion, I hear its military use, its strategic connotation: A diversion is a distraction, a maneuver carried out in order to take attention away from what is really going on. The very word diversion has as its root the verb divert, meaning “to turn away.” Thus, through diversion, we take up something, an activity of some sort, to distract ourselves from, to take our minds off of, what is really going on—namely, that we are on the way to death, that we are mortal, that our time is limited. The cleverness here is impeccable, for Pascal is arguing that diversions, or amusements, are what keep our thoughts away from death so that we can enjoy life while it lasts. As long we keep ourselves busy, we are under the sway of fascinatio nugacitatis, the fascination with triviality. Here is why:\n\nWeariness.—Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depths of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair (§131).\n\nIn our discussion of Pascal’s views on happiness, we ran into the idea of busyness, keeping oneself occupied at all times. The reason why is because, when we are idle, we slip into contemplation, the eventual result of which is melancholy. This viewpoint is actually encapsulated pretty well by Captain Beatty in Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, when he says, “Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide-rule, measure, and equate the universe, which just won’t be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely” (Bradbury 54). We recall, here, Pascal’s terror at the emptiness of the sky. Here is a man who spent the first half of his life trying to unlock nature’s secrets, only to realize he had been forsaken. Meanwhile, most Europeans who were not geniuses were living their day-to-day lives, trying to make ends meet. Who can we assume was happier? I think we can safely say the average European, notwithstanding, of course, the threat of religious violence or disease that was always looming in the 17th-century. If we look at the people, not their conditions, then certainly the one who gives less thought to his life is happier than the one who gives more thought to it. This Pascal knew. It matters not what we do, just as long as we are always doing something, whatever it takes not to set our eyes on death.\n\nToday, little has changed: Whenever I bring up the topic of solitude, my friends always talk about how horrible it is, how painful being alone with their thoughts is—they cannot stand to be by themselves for even five minutes. I suppose Pascal was right in seeing this not as some sort of historical malady, but rather as our very condition. The psychologist Ernest Becker, fittingly, wrote a famous book called The Denial of Death defending this thesis. A famous—arguably the most famous—passage in the Pensées declares the following: “I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber” (§139).\n\nSo what does diversion look like? Pascal’s Jansenist beliefs made him incredibly ascetic, so much so that, at the end of his life, he wore a chastity belt and forbade any signs of affection in his presence. Appropriately, then, Pascal showed disdain for anything worldly, even things as innocuous as playing sports or watching a movie. If it prevents us from thinking about our condition, then it is trivial; it is diversionary. I agree with Pascal to an extent here, although I think it is also fair to call his claims a little extreme, but this is excusable because of his circumstances.\n\nThink of our love of parties. People love being with a huge crowd of people where they can lose themselves, forgetting their problems as they drink the night away, or do drugs to take the strain off a hard day, completely in the present, without inhibitions—they are living life to the fullest, seizing the day, leaving without regrets. But more importantly, they are not thinking about death. At a party, there is life; a great party is great because it is animated, it is animat-ing, it fills us with vivacity. There, there is no room for death, for we are there to live. But if we take a step back, then what we are really doing is abusing ourselves, our bodies and our minds. We are mistreating ourselves, neglecting our condition in a state of forgetfulness, “tranquility,” as Heidegger described it. Sure, partying or having fun is pleasurable, and we can all use it from time to time, but it distracts us from coming to grips with ourselves. We are avoiding thinking about death, and this is to our detriment, Pascal believes. He has no patience for today’s libertines, those who indulge themselves at whatever chance they get, pursuing a life of pleasure:\n\n[W]e condemn those who live without thought of the ultimate end of life, who let themselves be guided by their own inclinations and their own pleasures without reflection and without concern, and, as if they could annihilate eternity by turning away their thought from it, think only of making themselves happy for the moment… This resting in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who pass their life in it must be made to feel its extravagance and stupidity, by having it shown to them, so that they may be confounded by the sight of their folly (§195).\n\nThe biggest criticism is that the ignorant person assumes “they could annihilate eternity by turning their thought from it,” when they are merely overlooking it. As such, we are like infants without a sense of object permanence, playing peekaboo: When the hands close, all is fine, but we are suddenly startled as soon as they open, revealing the grim reality of death, catching us off-guard. Death is always lurking, a latent possibility, and we never know when it will strike. Those who choose to divert and distract themselves are wasting their lives away, led “unconsciously to death” (§171); the reason I use this harsh wording is because attention must be drawn to the “unconscious” part. Think about Netflix: Who does not love it? Collectively, people watch millions of hours of television daily—ponder that! This is what Pascal is referring to, viz., that “diversion… leads us unconsciously to death”; lying on our deathbeds, we will ask, “Where did all my time go?” The answer: Diversions such as Netflix. Hence, “unconsciously,” because it consumes us just as much as we consume it.\n\nConsider, too, the example of a drug addict who hits “rock bottom,” a phrase we use to indicate when someone has reached the lowest depths and achieves a moment of clarity. At this moment, the addict realizes the damage they have done to themselves, and they confront, honestly and really, the fact of death—their death—whereupon they decide that enough is enough, so they resolve to pick themselves up and go sober. Such, I imagine, is what Pascal meant by “having it [the extravagance and stupidity of ignorance] shown to them, so that they may be confounded by the sight of their folly.” A perspective evident in Heidegger. It is only when the hedonist realizes (1) the vanity of pleasure and (2) their mortality that they can begin to understand and devote themselves to what Pascal calls “the ultimate end of life,” or salvation, which can only come from an honest appraisal of oneself, followed by the commitment to humble and purify oneself, morally and spiritually, by looking inward. Ian P. McGreal puts it this way: “In the brief moment when we are on earth, suspended between the infinities of space and time, it is too dangerous to refuse to recognize our situation… When we realize our situation we will also realize that knowing the answer can make an inordinate difference—an eternal difference, in understanding why we are here, and what we can achieve.”[1] Yet regarding the hedonists, Pascal clarifies,\n\nTheir error does not lie in seeking excitement, if they seek it only as a diversion; the evil is that they seek it as if the possession of the objects of their quest would make them really happy. In this respect it is right to call their quest a vain one… They do not know that it the chase, and not the quarry, which they seek (§139).\n\nThere seems to be a continuation of man’s greatness here: Man is great because he acknowledges his own wretchedness, just as diversion is unobjectionable if it pursued “only as diversion.” These days, we are fond of saying, “It’s the journey, not the destination”—and this is at what Pascal is getting. Pleasure, he said, comes from occupation. Falsely, the Sybarite, the pleasure-seeker, attaches happiness to the object of their search, the destination, whereas it is the journey, the search itself, which brings happiness. But while Pascal seems to justify diversion here as long as we are conscious of ourselves doing it, that is, as long as we know it to be vain, it is pretty much nullified when we remember that he also said that we have an “inability to reach the good by our own efforts.”\n\nFundamentally, diversion is insufficient for achieving happiness in Pascal’s eyes because it is external and dependent, meaning it is unstable. As a means of reaching fulfillment, diversion is an activity that is not intrinsic to us, and we have no control over its outcome. By intrinsic, I mean that diversion is not something we can find in ourselves. If we try to entertain ourselves without anything, then we inevitably end up thinking about death, and that is what we are trying to avoid! Thus, we need something at hand, but we can never count on that unconditionally. Our mood, where we are, who else is involved, etc.—these are all variables that risk upsetting and derailing our entertainment, and so divertissement turns out to be undependable\n\nExistential psychologist Peter Koestenbaum said of Pascal, “In the last analysis, Pascal’s view of the condition de l’homme as inconstance, ennui, inquiétude [inconstancy, weariness, unrest] is perhaps more accurate than Heidegger’s equivalent Sein-zum-Tode [being-toward-death].”[2] This is because Pascal, foremost, understands “the fragility of human life,” and provides “a constant reminder of something most men know when they think about it [their mortality] but which they often wish to forget,” coupled with “[a] sense of the contingency of life, of uncertainty about its duration.” It is not as if we do not know we will die; it is just that we “wish to forget” it—”wish” because, in the end, it lies outside our power, and we can only dream of immortality [3]. But as much as possible, we need to be awakened from this dream, and Pascal is the one to administer this salutary solution.\n\nFinally, we end by looking at Pascal’s theory of knowledge, and how it is limited in man. Regarding epistemology, Pascal is once again torn, this time between skepticism, which teaches that truth is relative and impossible, and dogmatism, which teaches that truth is absolute and certain. He associates skepticism, or Pyrrhonism as he alternately called it, invoking its ancient roots, with the modern essayist Michel de Montaigne, who espoused this way of viewing truth; and he associates dogmatism with Stoicism, the ancient Greco-Roman philosophy that was making a comeback in his day. Where the skeptics prized humility, seeing truth as unattainable, the Stoics prized pride, seeing truth as something attainable, and attaching it to a way of life. Based on what we know about Pascal’s thought—that he considered man to be worthy of both pride and humility, but mostly humility—we might assume he tried to synthesize the two approaches and find common ground; however, this was impossible. There is no possible way to reconcile an undiscoverable truth with a means to apprehend truth. It simply will not work. To have the two coexist, would amount to a contradiction. If both will not work, then one must, certainly. Which one, then?\n\n“Nature confutes the skeptics, and reason confutes the dogmatists,” Pascal writes disappointingly (§434). The life of the skeptic is foiled by his very existence. Common sense will not allow skepticism. To doubt, there must be something to doubt—and this much is indubitable. Basically, Pascal is saying in the first half what G.E. Moore would write almost 300 years later when making his own reply to skepticism in “Proof of the External World” (1939): “Here is one hand.” As much as we profess to disbelieve in the world, it is impossible, Pascal contends, to truly do so; the presence of it, its obviousness, is overwhelming. Conversely, the dogmatic approach does not hold its own, either, particularly when put under pressure by reason. Philosophers have given a whole host of reasons why we should doubt our knowledge: The skeptics, naturally, with their distrust of the senses; Descartes, with his classic outline of the Dream Argument and Evil Demon hypothesis; and Berkeley, who claimed, “To be, is to be perceived,” just to name a few. Whatever we can come up with, be it a logical proof or an external object, can be subjected to rigorous examination, and in some form refuted or mistrusted. What we are left with is an abyss. There appears to be no way to know—or not to know.\n\nAnd so Pascal declares skepticism the winner. Why? Well, the very fact that there is skepticism, seems to justify it. If knowledge truly were not doubtable, if it were absolute as the dogmatists make it out to be, then doubt would not cross our minds; the fact that we do doubt, lends credence to the skeptic position; otherwise, it would not exist. Simply put, we cannot know everything. This rightly causes anguish. We cannot help but search for knowledge, in spite of the impossibility hereof. It is an endless quest.\n\nWhile on this quest, we must be wary: “Two extremes: to exclude reason, to admit reason only” (§253). When we leave out reason, we become dogmatic, adhering to whatever we hear without questioning it, which causes closed-mindedness; simultaneously, we ought not to rely solely on reason, for it is limited, and it risks suffocating us with rigidity and lifelessness. For this reason, Pascal came to favor intuition over intellect, anticipating the philosophy of Henri Bergson, who like Pascal was religious and tried to define the limits of scientific thought.\n\nPascal’s skepticism becomes obvious when, building off of Montaigne, he declares there are no universal truths. We act according to custom, to what is socially accepted, because tradition is sturdy and time-tested. Thus, in the ancient Sophistical debate of law (nomos, νομος) versus nature (physis, φυσις), Pascal sides with nomos, convention, believing nurture to be more formidable than nature. This only applies to society, though. Individually, nature proves to be more effective than nurture.\n\nBecause he preferred intuition to any other source of insight, and because he was an irrationalist, Pascal located the closest source of truth inside man, whence his most famous (his second most being about sitting by oneself in a room) quote: “The heart [le cœur] has its reasons, which reason does not know” (§277). It is easy to interpret this quote, as many have—myself included—in terms of love, due to the use of “heart,” yet he is not writing about love here, but knowledge; you would not be wrong to connote it with emotion, however. Indeed, Pascal is communicating that the heart, meaning not just (a) emotion, but also (b) our core, is our main go-to for knowledge, which is why we say, for example, “Follow your heart,” or “Trust your gut”—in both cases, we are usually not referring to these functions literally, but to their inwardness, their being situated at our core, our center, where lie our most cherished values. In addition, to speak of the heart as “ha[ving] its reasons” that are inaccessible to Reason itself, is to claim, first, that the heart is not wholly arational, or else it would have its “feelings,” and not reasons; and second, that the heart is hereby higher than Reason in going beyond it, to the point of being incomprehensible to it. Obviously, then, Reason would not be able to understand the heart—the two work at different levels. Therefore, rationality cannot prove what the heart tells us; we have to trust it completely, with our whole selves.\n\nLe cœur, faith, is therefore Absurd, just like Kierkegaard said. Others might think us crazy to follow our hearts, and, in truth, it is a crazy thing to do, but that is exactly why we have to do it with 100% commitment. This enables Pascal to say, “It is the heart that experiences God, and not the reason. This, then, is faith: God felt by the heart, not by the reason” (§278). Pascal, like Kierkegaard, was a fideist, maintaining that knowledge is grounded in faith, which is why he attacked Descartes’ argument for God, based entirely on metaphysics—the argument rested on reason, not the heart. Will Durant ties up Pascal’s convictions well: “In our hearts we feel… that it would be the greatest of all blasphemies to think that life and the universe have no meaning. God and the meaning of life must be felt by the heart, rather than reason.”[4] Having faith becomes a necessity, an ought, because without faith, we lose the will to live, we lose the sense that life has meaning, and this, truly, is wretched.\n\nHopefully, by this exploration of Pascal’s Pensées, I have accomplished the task I set out in the introduction: To show that Pascal is, in fact, an existentialist thinker whose thought has a deeply critical bearing on our everyday lives. We have seen how Pascal, influenced by his pessimistic Jansenist morals and early scientific career, went from an eager experimenter to an anxious Christian concerned with his salvation, troubled by the shortness of life, and its apparent vanity. By turning inward, by rejecting the world, he came to his inner essence, at which point he decided to write out his thoughts on the human condition. From this man, we learn the uncomfortable truth of existence: That happiness usually falls outside our control, that we constantly look for ways to keep ourselves busy, that we sacrifice authenticity for superficial appearances, that we are at once insignificant in the Universe and significant in our own worlds, that we fear death so much that we never live, that we hate solitude, that our knowledge is limited, and that, sometimes, we just need a little faith—it need not be religious. If you ever have the chance, get yourself a copy of the Pensées and flip through it out of order, because most of the aphorisms are short, but they are enough to keep you up at night, such is their brilliance and honesty. If there is one last thing we should take from Pascal, something of existential import, then it is that actions speak louder than words. Pascal was a man of his words. Until his death, he embraced pain and suffering, as befit a “proper Christian,” in his eyes, “which is no small achievement”[5].\n\n[1] McGreal, Great Thinkers of the Western World, p. 211c\n\n[2] Koestenbaum, The Vitality of Death, p. 33\n\n[3] Magill, Masterpieces of World Philosophy in Summary Form, p. 415b\n\n[4] Durant, The Story of Civilization, Vol. 8, p. 64\n\n[5] Magill, op. cit., p. 416c\n\nVarious photos from pexels.com."
