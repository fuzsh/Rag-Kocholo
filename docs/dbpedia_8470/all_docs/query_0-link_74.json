        "text": "Caption\n\n1700 Edition of Montaigne's Essays with coloured portrait frontis. Michel de Montaigne (28 February 1533 - 13 September 1592). Philosopher and aristocrat of the French Renaissance. His \"Essays\" had a direct influence on scientists and philosophers and psychologists across hundreds of years, including Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Albert Hirschman, William Hazlitt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stefan Zweig, Eric Hoffer and even Isaac Asimov. Montaigne's remark, \"Que scay-je?\" (\"What do I know?\") embodied the spirit of doubt at once in one's own perception and observation, - while at the same time regarding it as the only thing to depend on. He had very forward looking views on how a child's curiosity can be harnessed for education by experience rather than rote learning. The 'Essays' is still an insightful read even today."
