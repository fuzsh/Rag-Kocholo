        "text": "Mr. Chandrakant Sampat had some time ago recommended to me “The Corrosion of Character” by Richard Sennett. More recently, I came across another book of Mr. Sennett, “Together”. The book is a multi disciplinary work on the craft of co-operation, relevant and timely in the rising inequalities between the elites and the rest which is being witnessed globally today. I enjoy reading Mr. Sennett works and have more recently ordered “The Fall of Public Man”.\n\nHere is a part from the end of the book, “Together”:\n\n“At the end of his life, the philosopher Michel de Montaigne (1533-92) inserted a question into an essay written many years before: ‘When I am playing with my cat, how do I know she is not playing with me?’ The question summed up Montaigne's long-held conviction that we can never really plumb the inner life of others, be they cats or other human beings. Montaigne's cat can serve as an emblem for the demanding sort of cooperation. My premise about cooperation has been that we frequently don't understand what's passing in the hearts and minds of people with whom we have to work. Yet just as Montaigne kept playing with his enigmatic cat, so too a lack of mutual understanding shouldn't keep us from engaging with others; we want to get something done together.\n\nChateau de Montaigne\n\nMontaigne was a master of dialogical thinking. He was born the year Holbein painted The Ambassadors. Like Holbein's young emissaries to Britain, the young Montaigne had a political education as a member of the parlement of Bordeaux – a regional council of notables; like these two emissaries, he came to know the religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants close up. The civil wars of religion in the mid-sixteenth century convulsed the Bordeaux region, and threatened the village in which his family's own domains lay; tribalism of the religious kind led to the burning of enemy fields, the starvation-siege of towns, and random, terrorist murder. While Montaigne took the side of the Protestant leader Henri de Navarre, his heart was neither in religious dogma nor in professional politics. In 1570, two years after the death of his father, he retired to his estate, and even further within it to a tower within the south-east corner of the chateau, where he set up a room in which to think and to write. In this chamber, he began both to experiment with writing in a dialogical way and to think through its application to everyday cooperation.\n\nAlthough he had retired to an intimate stage, and spent much of his time on the wine-making which supported the estate, he had not withdrawn mentally and emotionally from concern with the wider world. The great friend of his youth, Etienne de La Boetie, had written a “Discourse on Voluntary Servitude” (probably in 1553, at the age of twenty-two), a study of the blind desire to obey, and Montaigne elaborated many of its precepts in his own writings. The religious wars had implanted in both young men a horror of the craving for faith, for service to an abstract principle or to a charismatic leader. Had the two friends lived a century later, the theatrics of Louis XIV would have embodied for them the state's effort to induce passive, voluntary submission among a crowd of spectators to a leader. Had they lived in our own time, the charismatic despots of the twentieth century would equally have posed, to Montaigne and La Boetie, the threat of passive obedience. After La Boetie's early death, Montaigne continued to champion his friend's alternative idea of building political engagement from the ground up, based on ordinary cooperation in a community.\n\nMontaigne was a seigneur who availed himself fully of his historic privileges, so that he certainly cannot be likened to a radical community organizer in the modern sense, yet he studied how the communal life around him was organized, hoping to gather from casual chats, the rituals surrounding wine-making and the care of dependants on his estate how La Boetie's project of participation built from the ground up might be realized.\n\nMontaigne's emblematic, enigmatic cat lay at the heart of this project. What passes in the minds of those with whom we cooperate? Around this question Montaigne associated other aspects of practising cooperation: dialogic practices which are skilled, informal and empathic. Great writers usually inspire in us the sentiment that they are our contemporaries, speaking directly to us, and of course there's a danger in this. Still, Montaigne had a prophetic grasp about what these elements of cooperation entail.\n\nBlaise Pascal\n\nBlaise Pascal singled out Montaigne as 'the incomparable author of “the art of conversation”’. The 'art' of conversing is for Montaigne in fact the skill of being a good listener, a matter of attending both to what people declare and to what they assume; in one essay, Montaigne likens the skilled listener to a detective. He detested Bernard Williams's 'fetish of assertion' on the speaker's part. Fierce assertion directly suppresses the listener, Montaigne says; the debater demands only assent. In his essay, Montaigne observes that, in society more largely, the declaration of a speaker's superior knowledge and authority arouses doubt in a listener about his or her own powers of judgement; the evil of passive submission follows from feeling cowed.\n\nMontaigne disputes that the skilled detection of what others mean but do not say is the province of exceptional minds; this detective and contemplative skill, he insists, is a potentiality in all human beings, one suppressed by assertions of authority. The idea of everyday diplomacy would have made sense to him for just this reason; once freed from top-down commands, people require skill in keeping silent, in showing tact, in that lightening of differences which Castiglione called sprezzatura – at least this was so between Catholics and Protestants in the town next to Montaigne's estate when political authority collapsed as a result of the nation's religious wars; only the vigilant practice of everyday diplomacy allowed people in the town to carry on with life on the streets.\n\nAs a man moving around his local community, Montaigne enjoyed what we have called dialogic conversations more than dialectical arguments, tinged as all disputes were for him with the threat of descent into violence. He practised dialogics in his writing; his essays bounce from subject to subject, seeming to wander at times, yet the reader finishes each with the sense that the author has opened up a topic in unexpected ways, rather than narrowly scored points.\n\n'Dialogics' is in fact a modern name for a very old narrative practice; the ancient historian Herodotus employs it, creating a mosaic of fragments which, as in Montaigne's essays, produce a coherent large form. But Montaigne was, I think, the first to deploy this literary practice with a certain cunning: narrating in bits and pieces will suppress readerly aggression. By dissipating emotional temperature in the reader, as in an essay on cruelty, he hopes, ironically, to make the vices of cruelty stand out more in their sheer unreasonableness; he hopes in this way that, as he says, the reader will 'unlearn evil'. For Montaigne, this was the point of dialogics -looking at things in the round to see the many sides of any issue or practice, the shifting focus making people cooler and more objective in their reactions.\n\nAs a man of his time, Montaigne was entranced by skill of a technical sort. Rather than the elaborate astronomical devices resting on Holbein's table, Montaigne was interested in more everyday crafts, such as carpenters' lathes, new culinary tools like clockwork spits for roasting, and above all he was fascinated by plumbing; water pumps for ornamental fountains and cattle basins seem particularly to have fascinated him. These prosaic interests become incorporated into a pair of essays, 'Habit' and 'Same Design: Different Outcomes'. Habits, he says, steady a skill, but the rule of unchanging habit is a tyranny; good habits are those 'designs' left free to produce different 'outcomes'. This precept applies equally, he argues, to machines and to men. It seems obvious to him, and so he leaves it as just a stray observation. We've sought to show that by modulating their habits people become more interactive, both in exploring objects and in engaging with one another. The craft ideal has governed our exploration of making and repairing physical things and social relations.\n\nMontaigne was, Sarah Bakewell observes, the philosopher par excellence of modesty, particularly the self-restraint which helps people to engage with others. Modesty encapsulates Montaigne's idea of civility, but his version little resembles the account of civility given by Norbert Elias. As a man, Montaigne was easy in his body, and wrote frequently about it, going into details about how his urine smells or when he likes to shit. Modesty without shame: Montaigne's idea of civility is in part that, if we can be easy with ourselves, we can be easy with other people. In a late essay he writes of informality, ‘in whatever position they are placed, men pile up and arrange themselves by moving and shuffling about, just as a group of objects thrown into a bag find their own way to join and fit together, often better than they could have been arranged deliberately.’\n\n'Our self', Montaigne writes in an essay on vanity, 'is an object full of dissatisfaction, we can see there nothing but wretchedness and vanity.' Yet this is not a counsel to engage in Luther's anguished self-struggle: 'so as not to dishearten us, Nature has very conveniently cast the action of our sight outwards.’ Curiosity can 'hearten' us to look beyond ourselves. Looking outward makes for a better social bond than imagining others are reflected in ourselves, or as though society itself was constructed as a room of mirrors. But looking outward is a skill people have to learn.\n\nMontaigne thinks empathy rather than sympathy is the cardinal social virtue. In the record he kept of life on his small country estate, he constantly compares his habits and tastes with those of his neighbours and workers; of course he is interested in the similarities, but he takes particular note of their peculiarities: to get along together, all will have to attend to mutual differences and dissonances.\n\nTaking an interest in others, on their own terms, is perhaps the most radical aspect of Montaigne's writing. His was an age of hierarchy in which inequalities of rank seemed to separate seigneurs and servants into separate species, and Montaigne is not free of this attitude; nonetheless, he is curious. It's often said that Montaigne is one of the first writers to dwell on his own personal self; this is true but incomplete. His method of self-knowledge is to compare and to contrast; he stages differentiating encounters and exchanges again and again in the pages of his essays. Frequently he is gratified by his own distinctiveness, but almost as often, as with his cat, he is perplexed by what makes others different.\n\nThe Scientific Instruments on Holbein’s Table\n\nLike Holbein's table, Montaigne's cat was an emblem fashioned at the dawn of the modern era to convey a set of possibilities; the table represented in part new ways of making things, the cat represented new ways of living together. The cat's backstory is Montaigne's, and La Boetie's, politics: cooperative life, freed of command from the top. What happened to these promises of modernity? In a pregnant phrase, the modern social philosopher Bruno Latour declares, ‘We have never been modern.’ He means specifically that society has failed to come to grips with the technologies it has created; nearly four centuries after Holbein, the tools on the table remain mystical objects. As concerns cooperation, I'd amend Latour's declaration: we have yet to be modern; Montaigne's cat represents human capabilities society has yet to nurture.\n\nThe twentieth century perverted cooperation in the name of solidarity. The regimes which spoke in the name of unity were not only tyrannies; the very desire for solidarity invites command and manipulation from the top. The perverse power of solidarity, in its us-against-them form, remains alive in the civil societies of liberal democracies, as in European attitudes toward ethnic immigrants who seem to threaten social solidarity, or in American demands for a return to 'family values'; the perverse power of solidarity makes itself felt early among children, reaching into the way they make friends and construct outsiders.\n\nSolidarity has been the Left's traditional response to the evils of capitalism. Cooperation in itself has not figured much as a strategy for resistance. Though the emphasis is in one way realistic, it has also sapped the strength of the Left. The new forms of capitalism emphasize short-term labour and institutional fragmentation; the effect of this economic system has been that workers cannot sustain supportive social relations with one another. In the West, the distance between the elite and the mass is increasing, as inequality grows more pronounced in neo-liberal regimes like those of Britain and the United States; members of these societies have less and less a fate to share in common. The new capitalism permits power to detach itself from authority, the elite living in global detachment from responsibilities to others on the ground, especially during times of economic crisis. Under these conditions, as ordinary people are driven back on themselves, it's no wonder they crave solidarity of some sort – which the destructive solidarity of us-against-them is tailor-made to provide.\n\nAfrican Ritual Dance\n\nIt's little wonder also that a distinctive character type has been bred by this crossing of political and economic power, a character type seeking to relieve experiences of anxiety. Individualism of the sort Tocqueville describes might seem to La Boetie, were he alive today, a new kind of voluntary servitude, the individual in thrall to his or her own anxieties, searching for a sense of security in the familiar. But the word 'individualism' names, I believe, a social absence as well as a personal impulse: ritual is absent. Ritual's role in all human cultures is to relieve and resolve anxiety, by turning people outward in shared, symbolic acts; modern society has weakened those ritual ties. Secular rituals, particularly rituals whose point is cooperation itself, have proved too feeble to provide that support.\n\nJacob Burckhardt"
