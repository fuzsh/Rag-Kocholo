        "text": "So, are we all Montaignes now? In many ways, yes.\n\nFew of us write long books of essays, and even fewer of us immerse ourselves in classical and historical sources until they become indistinguishable from our very selves. But we are curious, well-informed, well-connected, introspective and hyper-communicative. We never tire of talking about the things that go through our heads. The diversity of cultural perspectives is a familiar idea to us, in a way it wasn't in the 16th century, and many take it for granted that truth is relative. We know about psychology: about unconscious drives, repressed memories, hormones, and moods. We don't expect ourselves to be rational all the time. We apparently forgive ourselves a lot of bad behaviour, on the excuse that it's the fault of our upbringing or genes. Do we really need Montaigne to tell us to relax, accept our mistakes, go with the flow, and gaze fascinated at ourselves all day?\n\nThe line of people who have considered Montaigne a bad influence on humanity is a long one. The 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal was disturbed by his scepticism and easy acceptance of human fallibility. For Pascal, the last thing people need is self-acceptance: they need a spiritually elevating image of themselves to aspire to. Later, the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche branded the Essays dangerous on the grounds that they were too enjoyable to read. By giving pleasure, Montaigne dulled his readers' reason, then seduced them into his own lax ways.\n\nOther writers attacked Montaigne's digressiveness, self-obsession and all-embracing doubt for similar reasons. The underlying accusation tends to be that he reflects us as we are, not as we should be. Perhaps reading Montaigne is like sitting an exam, making a hash of most of the answers, yet being given a shining \"A\" just for turning up. Is this what we want from our philosophers? Can we learn from this kind of writing?\n\nI think we can, and I also think it is a mistake to read Montaigne's forgiving, descriptive style of philosophy as either lazy or lacking in moral force. He himself said that there is nothing harder than tracing the movements of a mind accurately and honestly. Moreover, in describing what he found in human nature, he also searched for ways of living well with that nature. For all our 21st-century self-awareness, we are no better (or worse) at these two tasks than human beings ever were. If he feeds some of our fashionable vices, he also reminds us of unfashionable virtues.\n\nTo take just one example of how we can derive wisdom from Montaigne: his Essays give us a wealth of anecdotes exploring ways of resolving violent confrontations. As a teenager in Bordeaux, Montaigne had witnessed one such scene, which apparently stayed with him for life. Riots had broken out following a new tax imposed in 1548, and an angry mob besieged the home of the city's lieutenant-general Tristan de Moneins. Ignoring friends' advice to stay indoors, he went out to meet them. This showed courage, but he failed to see it through with a show of authority and confidence. Shocked by seeing their aggression close-up, Moneins fawned and pleaded with the crowd. They responded by tearing him to pieces. Montaigne never forgot this, and he suggested that Moneins might have survived had he either behaved more boldly, or bowed to his fear and stayed in hiding. The mixture of the two was unwise, and fatal.\n\nMontaigne filled his book with similar scenes, each having a different twist. Many examples came from his classical reading – stories of battles, sieges, challenges and rebellions, with thoughts on what could be learned from them. Others were from his own life. Once, he was robbed in a forest by bandits who wanted to hold him captive for further ransom. Betraying no fear, he stood before them and announced that whatever they did they would never get any more money. He looked like he meant it, so they believed him and backed down. On other occasions, he chose a less defiant approach. A group of maverick soldiers inveigled their way into his home as guests, planning to ransack it. Montaigne guessed what they were up to, but offered his hospitality with such open friendliness that their captain warmed to him. He changed his mind and the gang left him in peace.\n\nMontaigne's analyses of these situations is psychological, but also moral. He wanted to find solutions that enable everyone both to survive and to remain fully human. Appealing confidently to an opponent's shared humanity does not always work (nothing always works), but it is both honourable and practical: it is a better way than most.\n\nCase studies such as these were the fruit of a lifetime of reading and experience, mingled with Montaigne's distinctive sensibility. As we read, we contribute similar ingredients of our own. For example, reading Montaigne gave me a new way of thinking about the famous Tiananmen Square scene of 1989, when a lone protester, shopping bag in hand, stopped a line of tanks by standing in front of them, showing neither fear nor anger. Was it because he trusted the first tank driver as a human being that he was able to stop the whole battalion? I have often wondered what was in the protester's head; now I wonder at least as much about what was in the tank driver's head.\n\nTo read Montaigne is constantly to bring our own experience of life to bear, and some of our era's collective experience too. We each tease out our own strands of philosophy from what he has to say. This series has plucked at just a few of those strands, the ones that appeal most to me – Montaigne's ways of dealing with fear and grief, his attitude to faith and doubt, his ability to share others' perspectives, his ethics of fellow-feeling, his use of writing to cultivate presence of mind, and now his moral psychology of conflict and trust.\n\n\"There is nothing so beautiful and legitimate as to play the man well and properly\", wrote Montaigne in the closing chapter of the Essays; \"no knowledge so hard to acquire as the knowledge of how to live this life well and naturally. And the most barbarous of our maladies is to despise our being.\" I can think of worse ways of going into the second decade of the 21st century than with such thoughts in mind."
