        "text": "Blaise Pascal has been viewed as a major modern philosopher but today is being increasingly ignored. One of my passions is philosophy and I was shocked to discover that the famous Pascal was totally ignored in the popular “Philosophy: 100 Essential Thinkers” (2010) and “The Story of Philosophy” by Bryan Magee (1998) and “The Oxford Companion to Philosophy” (1995). However, he does merit a four page entry by RH Popkin (Emeritus Philosophy Professor, Washington University-St. Louis, MO) in “Great Thinkers of the Western World” (1992) and a substantial write-up in Wikipedia. Even a Google search on the word Pascal first lists the scientific unit of pressure named in his honour. This essay will examine this major omission of Pascal from the ranks of the principal philosophers of Western Europe. We shall show that he annoyed too many powerful people both then and later, so it was easier to omit him than confront his radical, independent philosophical/religious thinking, while acknowledging his major mathematical achievements and minor scientific research.\n\nAn apt title for a longer essay on Blaise Pascal-the French, seventeenth century scientist, mathematician, philosopher and theologist-developed along a chronological line, could be: from nothing to nothing. The first 'nothing' plays a pivotal role in one of his earliest contributions to the field of physics, and concerns the discussion about the possibility of a vacuum in nature. For more than two thousand years, first by the Aristotelian philosophy of nature, then subsequently supported by Christian theology and philosophy, the existence of nothing, a pure void within the plenitude of being was considered as an impossibility, an odd idea contradicting the widely shared conviction that nature abhors a vacuum. Of course, Pascal was not the first to perform experiments with tubes filled with mercury, water or wine to produce the remarkable creation of seemingly-as we know now thanks to those experiments, also really-empty spaces within those tubes. He may not have been the first to conduct these experiments (Torricelli and Galileo preceded him), reading the reports and discussions of the experiments, reveals Pascal's tenacity. 2 Therein he is not directly arguing in favour or against the philosophically problematic idea of empty space; relying on the impossible idea of a vacuum, he explains the phenomena observed. This eventually allows him to conclude that the lowering of liquids in a tube, turned upside down in a vessel containing the same liquid and producing the vacuum in the upper part of the tube, is entirely due to air pressure. Which is indeed, as Alexandre Koyré once put it, a remarkable way of explaining the real via the impossible 3 , that is via the counter-intuitive idea of a natural nothingness. Taking a leap from the scientific observations and calculations stemming from the early stages of Pascal's adult life, to the months preceding his premature death in 1662 at the 1 Blaise Pascal, Pensées, trans. A.J. Krailsheimer, London: Penguin 1966, 240. This English translation relies on Louis Lafuma's edition of the Pensées. Following a common practice in referring to Pensées, the number of the pensée will be added, according to the Lafuma, Léon Brunschvicg and Philippe Sellier editions, respectively. The motto above is taken from: Laf. 656 / Br. 368 / Sel. 743. 2 See Dominique Descotes, 'Pascal. Le calcul et la théologie', in: Pour la science, 16 (2003), 1-93. 3 Alexandre Koyré, Etudes d'histoire de la pensée scientifique. Paris: Gallimard, 1966, 185-186.\n\nThe essay is a comparative look at Descartes' and Pascal's epistemology. For so vast a topic, I shall confine myself to comparing three crucial epistemological topics, through which I hope to evince Descartes' and Pascal's differences and points of contact. Firstly, I will concentrate on the philosophers' engagement with skepticism, which, for each, had different functions and motivations. Secondly, the thinkers' relation to Reason shall be examined, since it is the fulcrum of their thought—and the main aspect that separates them. Lastly, I will examine each philosopher's theist epistemology; this section, of course, will focus on how and by what means Descartes and Pascal set out to prove God's existence. The latter aspect shall take us back to each philosopher's relationship to Doubt: the title, \" The Giants of Doubt \", in fact, implies a fundamental link between Descartes and Pascal through Doubt. In addition, and most importantly, the contrast between the two thinkers' epistemology inaugurates a decisive scission in modern thought of enormous repercussion: Descartes' sturdy rationalism initiated the great branch of modern scientific inquiry , while Pascal's appeal to the power of intuition and feelings would eventually be the precursor of the reaction to the enlightenment that invested Europe by the second half of the eighteenth century. This departure of thought, which in my view may be traced back to them, has not been the common conceit of the history of philosophy: the reaction to the enlightenment has customarily been regarded as stemming from its internal contradictions or at best from its more radical doctrines. The essay shall show that these strands of thought were both parallel and born out of the antithetical epistemologies of Descartes and Pascal."
