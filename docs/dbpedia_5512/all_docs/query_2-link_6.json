        "text": "Wikipedia Biographical Summary:\n\n\"...Gilbert Belnap (December 22, 1821 - February 26, 1899) was a Mormon pioneer, LDS Church leader, and an early colonizer of Ogden, Utah, Fort Lemhi, Idaho and Hooper, Utah...\"\n\n\"...Born in Port Hope, Ontario, Upper Canada, Belnap, the grandson of American Revolutionary War veteran Jesse Belnap, was orphaned at age 11. Attaching himself to an American company of light horse rangers as first sergeant, he was taken as prison-of-war in the Upper Canada Rebellion. Following his release, he eventually made his way to Kirtland, Ohio, where he was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1842...\"\n\n\"...Belnap married Adaline Knight, daughter of early LDS Church leader Vinson Knight and Martha McBride, founding member of the LDS Relief Society less than two months before the Mormons' expulsion from Nauvoo...\"\n\n\"...Soon after departing, Belnap lost his second son and child, 13-month-old John McBride Belnap, who died of cholera in 1850 and was buried in his father's tool chest near the Saline Ford at the confluence of Salt Creek and the Platte River along the Oxbow Trail...\"\n\n\"...In 1852 he was sealed to his first wife's first cousin, Henrietta McBride, in plural marriage. He eventually had 17 children, 15 of whom survived to adulthood, and 160 grandchildren...\"\n\n\"...He was selected as the first marshal of Ogden City. He also served as Ogden's first prosecuting attorney and first sexton of the Ogden City Cemetery. He later served as Weber County sheriff and held numerous other community positions, including pound keeper, city attorney, county attorney, county assessor and collector, county court selectman, school district trustee, irrigation company trustee, 1872 Utah state constitutional convention delegate, district census taker, and U.S. mail contract awardee...\""
