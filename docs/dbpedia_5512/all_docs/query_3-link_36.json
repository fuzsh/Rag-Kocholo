        "text": "Gregory John Belnap\n\nNovember 13, 1961 - December 28, 2020\n\nGregory John Belnap of Idaho Falls, Idaho died Monday afternoon, December 28, 2020, surrounded and cared for by family in Utah. For almost three years with patience, tenacity, and courage Greg fought cancer. He loved to make others smile and was defined by his passionate interest in life and relationships with God and the people he loved. He would always say, “My life is in God’s hands.”\n\nGregory John Belnap was born on November 13, 1961 in Ogden, Weber County, Utah to Max and Ora Jean Belnap, and was the youngest of six siblings. He attended Ogden City Schools (Wasatch Elementary and Mt. Ogden Junior High) and graduated from Ogden High School.\n\nGreg once reflected, “Not all of the events of my life have unfolded the way I anticipated. But through it all, I still maintain: ‘God is gracious.’ ‘God is gracious’ is the Hebrew meaning of my middle name, and ‘John’ was chosen because it was the name of both of my grandfathers. ‘Gregory’ is of Greek origin and means ‘watchful one.’”\n\nGreg lived and worked in Utah, Arizona, and Idaho. He worked for Wright Automotive Machine Shop and Parker-Hannefin while earning his associate degree at Weber State College. At that time, Greg enjoyed biking and skiing, but flying lessons at the Ogden Airport were his first priority.\n\nHe moved to Phoenix, then Tempe, Arizona to pursue his education in aeronautics and flight training at Arizona State University, where he was also a student instructor. In Arizona, Greg enjoyed his townhouse, purchased to enable him to live midway between his work at Simula Incorporated and his studies at the university. He attended Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. He also attended an accelerated aeronautics course in Florida.\n\nAfter working many years in Arizona, Greg got a job in the Salt Lake area and bought a townhouse in South Jordan, Utah so he could be closer to his aging parents. In 2016, he moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho and started work at the Idaho National Lab in a new, challenging job. There he continued his hobbies in aeronautics and mechanics. He appreciated the mechanics and design of automobiles and took great pride and care in the ones he owned. Aeronautics was his lifelong passion, and Greg held a pilot license for both single engine and multi-engine planes.\n\nGreg was a volunteer pilot for Flights for Life, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free air transportation of human blood, tissues, and organs to hospitals, blood banks, health-care agencies, and private individuals. The pilots donate their time, skill, and operational costs. By doing this service, Greg maintained his pilot certification, enjoyed his hobby, and served others—a win, win for all.\n\nGreg loved family and made it a priority to spend time with his family during the holidays. He was a mentor for Phoenix Matchpoint—a Christian mentoring program for at-risk youth—and volunteered on projects in Mexico.\n\nAs a child, Greg loved family vacation, and especially enjoyed the trip with his siblings and their spouses to Hawaii to celebrate his parents’ 50th wedding anniversary. He also loved to travel and made many memories traveling with close friends. Greg saw Lake Powell from the top of Rainbow Bridge and swam in the waters of Havasu and Moony Falls at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. He traveled to Brazil, Australia, and London. He said: “Yes! God is gracious. As time, opportunity and finances permit; I have spent my free time flying, skiing, snow-boarding, running, hiking, lifting weights, water-skiing, bicycling, computers, sailing, television and movies.” Greg lived life!\n\nThe family would like to thank healthcare workers in both Idaho Falls and Utah for their compassionate and supportive care.\n\nGreg will be deeply missed by his three sisters, Karen Clarke (Mark), Beverly Johnson, Valene Terry (Robert); many nieces and nephews; three aunts; and many cousins. He is preceded in death by his parents; his sister Janice Garrett; and his brother Douglas Belnap, who died just three days earlier.\n\nDue to COVID-19 restrictions, a private family service will be held on Saturday, January 2, 2021 at 11 am at Lindquist’s Roy Mortuary, 3333 W. 5600 S., Roy, Utah. Friends and family are invited to visit with family on Saturday morning from 9:30 to 10:30 am at the mortuary. Masks and social distancing are required. Those who come for visitation are requested to view the services live on their computers elsewhere, so the Utah state limit of 50 people is respected.\n\nDue to the pandemic, extended family and friends are encouraged to stay safe and view the services live at www.lindquistmortuary.com by scrolling down to the bottom of Greg’s obituary.\n\nInterment will be in the Hooper City Cemetery, 5301 S. 6300 W., Hooper, Utah.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in memory of Gregory John Belnap to the Max Gilbert and Ora Jean Belnap Scholarship Fund, Weber State University Development Office, 1265 Village Dr., Dept. 4018, Ogden, Utah 84408-4018."
