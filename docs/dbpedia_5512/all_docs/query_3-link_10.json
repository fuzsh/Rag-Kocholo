        "text": "Gilbert Belnap was presumably named after an uncle, Gilbert Belnap (1794-1851), who was one of the younger brothers of his father Rosel Belnap (1789-1832). The elder Gilbert Belnap, son of Jesse Belnap (1760-1854) and Eunice Hall (1762-1849), would have been in his mid-twenties when “our” Gilbert Belnap was born. It is unknown after whom this first Gilbert Belnap was named, as the name Gilbert does not appear to have been used previously within the family–at least not on Jesse Belnap’s side of the family. Of the 84 known grandchildren of Jesse Belnap and Eunice Hall, at least 4 grandchildren were named Gilbert, including “our” Gilbert Belnap. These other Gilberts, all of whom would be first cousins of “our” Gilbert Belnap, were:\n\nGilbert Belnap (1812-unknown), son of Jesse Belnap (1781-1849)\n\nGilbert Belnap (1821-1826), son of Ira Belnap (1785-1878)\n\nGilbert Milton Belnap (1837-unknown), son of Ansel Belnap (1787-1870)\n\nTwo great grandchildren of Jesse Belnap and Eunice Hall (but not through Gilbert Belnap)–nephews of Gilbert Belnap–carried the name Gilbert as a middle name: John Gilbert Belnap (1843-1843), son of Gilbert’s oldest brother Jesse Belnap (1807-1887), and Charles Gilbert Wilson (1850-1917), son of Gilbert’s sister Phoebe Rebeckah Belnap.\n\n“Our” Gilbert Belnap has had a number of his male descendants named after him. Ten of Gilbert’s 15 children who grew to adulthood and had children of their own named one of their own children after their father–6.25% of Gilbert’s 160 grandchildren. Interestingly, seven of those 10 grandchildren died in infancy or early childhood, of whom six were born and died prior to Gilbert’s own death. It appears that the name Gilbert, even during Gilbert’s life, rather than being an “unlucky” name, was instead used in memoriam by many of his children to honor their notable father.\n\nSo far, based on current family records, the name of Gilbert has passed down through at least eight generations, starting with “our” Gilbert Belnap. Viewed another way, there is at least one descendant of Gilbert Belnap named “Gilbert” for each of seven successive generations. Here is a list of such currently known “Gilbert Descendants Named Gilbert.” Starting with Generation 3 from Gilbert, individuals are grouped under their respective family branch. To a lesser extent, the names of Gilbert’s father Rosel (more often spelled “Roswell”) and grandfather Jesse have also entered the family naming lexicon.
