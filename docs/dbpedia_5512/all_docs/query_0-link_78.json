Sadler write about the history of Weber County, Utah for the Utah Centennial County History Series. \"Weber County was one of six original countys established in the territory of Utah in 1850, and for a time it bordered California and the Oregon territory. As other Utah counties were created, Weber County was reduced in size. The importance of Weber County was underscored by the Ogden and Weber rivers, which fostered continued growth along their banks. Settlements flourished along these rivers and their tributaries from early times.\" Published by the Utah State Historical Society and the Weber County Commission."
