He was married February 25, 1690-1 to Hannah Ayer, daughter of Nathaniel Ayer and Tamison Turloar (Thurlow ?), who was born December 19, 1672 and died November 17, 1779 at the age of 106 years and 11 months. His occupation was the same as that of his father, a joiner. He lived at Haverhill, Massachusetts. He served in the colonial wars, fought largely against the French Canadians, or the French Indian wars. In land transactions at Haverhill we find record of him between 1693 and 1747. Following the notes by Henry Wykoff Belknap: N. H. Patriot in 1837 says all children except one daughter who died at age 17, lived to an advanced age. An article on longevity in the Annals of the American Academy says they are the longest-lived family on record. When age 105, Hannah Ayer rode from Atkinson, New Hampshire to Plaistow on a pylon behind her son, Obadiah.\n\n\"Actually little is known about Ebenezer, beyond the fact that he worked as a joiner and engaged in a number of land transactions, of which two are worth noting. On October 21, 1693, he sold \"a parcel of meadow granted to me by my father, Samuel Belnap.\" This is the only known record of that gift, which antedated Samuel's gift of his homestead to Ebenezer in 1696. On May 17, 1740, when he was 72 years old, Ebenezer conveyed his own homestead to his youngest son for a consideration stated as 100 pounds (which was so low by comparison with amounts of other transactions as to raise a question about its possible fictitious nature.) As all the deeds for his buying and selling of land were obviously not recorded, the full extent of his transactions is not known, but he was still dealing in land as late as 1747, when 80 years old. We know the exact dates of birth of only his first three children. For the others the approximations shown below are what seem to be reasonable estimates intending to replace the widely varying birth dates that have often been given, circulating without proof.\"\n\nChildren:\n\nSarah, born December 23, 1691, died about 1792, married Isaac Newton on March 20, 1715-6;\n\nHannah, born August 11, 1693, died about 1799, married Thomas Flagg on June 11, 1713;\n\nMary, born January 13, 1694-5, died about 1795, married Nathaniel Merrill before 1716;\n\ndaughter born about 1696 died after 1795, married someone by the name of Cunningham;\n\nJohn, born 1698, died 1799, married Mehitabel Nourse, 1730, secondly he married Ruth Farr on June 10, 1736, and thirdly, Joanna Tainter, on January 3, 1777;\n\nJoseph, born about 1700, died July 20, 1788, married Prudence Morris on March 17, 1724-5;\n\nSamuel, born about 1702 (this is our antecedent) and he died 1757, before June 8th. He married Mary Dickinson on July 9, 1723.\n\nMoses, born about 1704, died March 13, 1803, married Mary Roberds, June 24, 1735 (see Note 1);\n\nAbiah, born about 1707, married Jonathan Roberts on April 6, 1731 (see Note 1);\n\ndaughter, died young;\n\nObadiah, born about 1715, died after October 14, 1803, married first Sarah Mitchell on October 27, 1742, secondly married Mary Dow (widow Marble and before that Widow Roberts).\n\nThe above biography is from the book \"Heritage with Honor, Genealogy and History of the ancestry and descendants of Gilbert Belnap (1821-1899)\" has his birth date as 1677 but then being 80 years old in 1747 making his correct birth date 1667.[1]\n\nSources\n\nâ†‘ W Dean Belnap, Heritage with Honor: Genealogy and History of the ancestry and descendants of Gilbert Belnap (1821-1899), (Bountiful UT: Gilbert Family Organization, 1974), p 88-9, 100-101.
