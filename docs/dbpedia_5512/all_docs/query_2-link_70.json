        "text": "Next morning at 9, I ate breakfast at the Wells, 218 miles from Ogden. We passed over some very barren country but after reaching the Humboldt River, it began to improve. At 5 p.m., we were 419 miles from Ogden at Humboldt Station, where we had supper at 6. We saw a good deal of wild game just before we arrived at Trucky River, the principal kinds being pheasants and elk. At 12, we reached the river. The Trucky River heads in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows down the west slope, watering a good deal of forest. One would judge by the sawmills that it is quite a timber country.\n\nWe reached the Summit Station at daybreak. This was the highest point the railroad reaches in this locality, having an elevation of 7017 feet. From there we began to descend into California and the scenery began to take on the beauty and colors which make California famous. Houses, orchards and vineyards were perched right on top of the mountains. On every side, one could see the marks of the gold diggers. At length we reached the foothills where the rolling slopes melted away into a plain covered with grain and greek oaks as far as the eye could see. All-in-all, it was a sight worth looking at. We got to Sacramento at 9 a.m., 744 miles from Ogden and 140 from San Francisco. As we crossed the Sacramento River, I saw my first steamboat, that is, to be close to one.\n\nThe country here seems to be a great farming district. There are orchards and vineyards in quarter sections, one right after the other. It was a beautiful sight after seeing some of the raw, rough country of Nevada. When we came to the Bay Station, the train was divided equally and half of it was run on each side of the ferryboat, so as to balance it properly. On each side of the boat were four large boilers, each one as large as four ordinary boilers, and in the center were the large engines that furnished the propelling force. When it shoved off, it seemed like a floating island. As we crossed, I noticed that the bay was covered with small fishing boats.\n\nWe arrived at Oakland at 1 p.m., the cars having come 14 miles across the bay. We checked our baggage at the Brooklyn Hotel, got off the train and went on the Oakland ferry. This was more like a ship than the one that ferried the train over, being equipped with life preservers and other regular ship equipment. After completing the three mile voyage from Oakland to San Francisco, we landed on the wharf and were almost deafened by hotel barkers shouting out the names and marvelous qualities of their respective hotels. A policeman asked us which hotel we wished to stop at and we told him the Brooklyn. He hailed a cab for us and we piled in and rattled off to the hotel over the rocky streets. We secured rooms at $0.50 a day. The principal part of the city is made up of business houses, built of stone and from five to seven stories in height. Most of them are fireproof."
