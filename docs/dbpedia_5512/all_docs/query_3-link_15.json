        "text": "Lamar Gilbert Belnap\n\nCLINTON a\" Lamar G. Belnap, 85, our father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend peacefully left this life after a battle with cancer that ended up enveloping his body. Until he was diagnosed, he was proud to tell you he had never spent a night in the hospitala\"even as he was born at home in Ogden, UT, October 14, 1926 to Gilbert Augustus Belnap and Rosetta Nalder. He was raised in the Ogden area attending Ogden schools, graduating from Weber College and the University of Utah.\n\nLamar joined the Navy when he was only 16 years old. He was a veteran of World War II and later in the Korean War was a fighter pilot. He was very patriotica\"always flying that US flag proudly. He was able to begin many a conversation with his cap proudly announcing his service and displaying the ships he served on and airplanes he flew. He faithfully attended ships reunions until the last couple of years.\n\nLamar met his sweetheart, Flora Packer on a blind date and they married June 18, 1954 ion the Salt Lake Temple. They raised five children in Clearfield: Dennis P. Belnap (Layton), Steven K. Belnap (Maricopa, AZ); Larry G. Belnap (Connie) of Layton; Sandy Kruitbosch (Dale) of Clinton; and a son, Kyle L. Belnap (Sheila), who proceeded him in death. He is survived by his loving wife of 57 years, a brother, Dutch Belnap of Ogden, 22 grandchildren and 36 great-grandchildren.\n\nLamar was a hard-working man working two full time jobs for 30 years. He would dress in a suit to work at Hill Air Force Base, come home and change into bib-overalls to work his job at the Railroad. And then in his spare time he sold cars! He was the most organized person one could meet. After retirement Lamar and Flora spent every winter in Yuma meeting some of their closest friends.\n\nHe was an avid golfer, sporting a hole-in-one at the age of 84. Some of his favorite times were golfing with his sons and grandsons. He had a miniature railroad collection, magazine collection, and was an amazing handyman. He was a painter and graphic designer and the best story-teller ever!\n\nLamar served in various positions in the LDS Church. He is well known for his kindness and acts of service. Everyone loved Lamar, but none more than his own grandchildren.\n\nThe family would like to thank Dr. Robert Taylor and Hearts for Hospice for the wonderful care given to Dad especially in his decline.\n\nFuneral services will be held Tuesday, December 27, 2011 at 11 a.m. at the Clinton 17th Ward Chapel, 1828 No. 3000 W., Clinton. Friends may visit family Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. at Lindquist''s Layton Mortuary, 1867 No. Fairfield Road and Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. at the chapel. Interment, Lindquist''s Memorial Gardens of the Wasatch, 1718 Combe Road, So. Ogden."
