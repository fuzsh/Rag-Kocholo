As we delve into the last 24 hours before Jimi Hendrix’s death, a mosaic of events emerges, shedding light on the complexities that marked the final chapter of his life. In the late summer of 1970, Jimi Hendrix, found himself entangled in a web of exhaustion, personal turmoil, and the pressures of his fast-paced life. Amidst relentless tours ( in this case “The Cry of Love Tour”) and a few moments in the recording studio, Jimi Hendrix grappled with various challenges.

Jimi Hendrix’s relationship with manager Mike Jeffery, the demanding schedules, and his struggles with depression and sleepless nights painted a somber backdrop to his final days. Just 3 weeks before his tragic end, Jimi Hendrix delivered a memorable performance at the Isle of Wight Festival, although marked by technical issues, showcased Jimi Hendrix’s resilience as he overcame numerous obstacles.

A week after this event, Jimi Hendrix took the stage in Germany at the Open Air Love & Peace Festival on September 6, 1970 — a performance that would stand as his last major concert before his untimely death. Jimi Hendrix’s final live performance was on September 16, 1970, at Ronnie Scott’s Club in London. This remarkable musical event, where Jimi, Eric, and War united on stage, was vividly recalled by Eric:

Hendrix made his entrance during the second set. There was a crack in the air. I introduced Jimi to the audience … the typical London jazz crowd tried to show indifference as he took the stage, but a ripple of applause greeted the greatest guitar player in the world.” He continued, “The guys in War held their ground as we launched into a triple-time version of ‘Tobacco Road.’ Having Hendrix onstage made [War guitarist Howard Scott] play better than he ever had before. We slid into ‘Mother Earth,’ a beautiful blues written by Memphis Slim. We ended the set with a burning jam. Jimi was flying. And then it was over.

What Happened to Jimi Hendrix in the Hours Before His Death?

The following day, on September 17, Jimi Hendrix woke up late in Monika Danneman’s London hotel. Danneman, his girlfriend at the time, would later play a central role in the events that unfolded. The last-known images of Jimi Hendrix were captured in Danneman’s garden, where he posed with his iconic Stratocaster, “the black beauty.” The day unfolded as they spent time together, immersed in mundane activities like shopping on the streets of London.

Wilson became a vital part of Jimi Hendrix’s life, she has relations beyond him with other rock stars like Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, and Miles Davis. Known as a “super groupie,” her glamorous yet controversial reputation underscored her magnetic pull towards Jimi Hendrix.

As night fell, Jimi Hendrix found himself in the home of strangers, drawn in by an invitation for tea. Unpredictably, the evening took a different course with the inclusion of wine and hash. Danneman, uncomfortable with the situation, left the house with Jimi Hendrix, sparking a heated discussion fueled by her jealousy over the women in Jimi Hendrix’s life.

Back at Danneman’s hotel, Jimi Hendrix took a bath and began crafting what would become his final words in a song titled “The Story of Life.” The lyrics were a poignant reflection of his state of mind:

The story of Jesus so easy to explain After they crucified him, A woman, she claimed his name The story of Jesus The whole Bible knows Went all across the desert And in the middle, he found a rose…

Later in the evening, tensions between Jimi Hendrix and Monika Danneman persisted. She dropped him off at the party they had been invited to but, due to their argument, she left him there. Jimi Hendrix reportedly ate Chinese food and a cocktail of drugs, including an amphetamine tablet, and spent the night in a haze.

From 2 am until his tragic death, only Monika Danneman was present. She claims to be the sole witness to the events that occurred. According to her account, they returned to the hotel, and she made Jimi Hendrix a tuna sandwich before heading to bed—an assertion that subsequent investigations would challenge.

At 6 am, Monika Danneman alleges that Jimi Hendrix was still awake, requesting sleeping pills. She initially insisted he needed to wait. As dawn broke, Danneman took sleeping pills. Jimi, with Monika sleeping, also took sleeping pills. The lethal combination of alcohol, Vesparax, and other substances led to a tragic outcome. Subsequently, Jimi, in an altered state, vomited a mixture of wine and indigestible food, which was aspirated into his lungs.

As the morning sun rose on September 18, 1970, Jimi Hendrix, aged 27, died.
