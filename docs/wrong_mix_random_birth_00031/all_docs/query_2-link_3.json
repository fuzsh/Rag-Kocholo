        "text": "On the evening of September 17, 1970, Eric Clapton walked up the steps to Lyceum Theatre in London. He carried with him a white, left-handed Fender Stratocaster guitar.\n\nThe guitar he held was intended as a gift for Jimi Hendrix, who he'd planned to meet at the theatre.\n\nThe meeting never took place. The guitar remained with Clapton and, several hours later, Hendrix was found dead in his girlfriend's hotel room.\n\nLater, in an interview with the BBC, Clapton claimed he had seen Hendrix that night across the other side of the theatre, sitting in a private box.\n\nIt was a strange recollection given that all the available evidence suggests Hendrix never made it to the Lyceum that night.\n\nBut the Clapton story is just one of many contested versions of Jimi Hendrix's last night alive.\n\nInconsistencies and conspiracies\n\nAccording to Philip Norman, the author of the new book Wild Thing, the key witnesses to events that night are Hendrix's companion, Monika Dannemann, and his friend, musician Eric Burdon.\n\nDannemann repeatedly told conflicting stories about what happened. Having found Hendrix unresponsive, either dead or near death, she claimed she rang an ambulance some time between 9:00am and 11:00am. Later, she insisted Hendrix was alive as he was loaded into the ambulance.\n\nBut that version of events is at odds with Eric Burdon's recollections. He claimed, after a frantic call from Monika, he came to the hotel at dawn just in time to see the ambulance disappearing down the street.\n\nIn the hotel room he found a poetic note penned by Hendrix titled The Story of Life and assumed it to be a suicide note. He then told anyone who cared to listen Hendrix had overdosed intentionally.\n\nAs Philip Norman points out, there are significant inconsistencies in the accounts, most notably over the time the ambulance was called. Both are at odds with the official records which show an ambulance being dispatched at 11:18am.\n\nWith his kind of misinformation circulating, conspiracy theorists had a field day. Some suggested manager Mike Jeffery had organised his death to cash in on a $2 million insurance policy to pay off a debt to the mafia.\n\nOthers put forward the idea the guitar maestro had a death wish and had taken his own life.\n\nOverwhelmed by impossible contradictions\n\nIn truth, the reason Jimi Hendrix died that night might be more straightforward.\n\nAccording to the most recent medical evidence, it was the combination of drugs he chose that created the problem.\n\nIt was a lethal cocktail for a man already in poor physical condition, meaning that when he vomited in his sleep he couldn't clear his airway.\n\nFor all the confusion, though, one thing is clear: the bad decisions he made and the contested versions of his final hours were entirely in keeping with the desperately-chaotic final year of his life.\n\nIn that year, Hendrix was a man trapped by his own success, his life overwhelmed by impossible contradictions.\n\nHere was a black artist whose major audience was white; a performer with a riveting but gimmicky stage act who wanted to be acknowledged as a serious musician; a massively creative talent with a manager who could see nothing but dollar signs.\n\nAs Hendrix's biographer Charles R. Cross puts it so clearly: \"The life he created as a star was as lonely and isolating as his fractured childhood.\"\n\nMusician Juma Sultan, who shared the stage with him at Woodstock, recently told Uncut magazine that Hendrix was trying to create a new type of music.\n\n\"Jimi wanted to take time off â€” maybe a year or so and develop his sound. He was hearing symphonies in his head and he could never get to it because they had him locked into Hey Joe and Foxy Lady,\" Sultan said.\n\nBut in that final year there would be no time off for Hendrix.\n\nThe musician wanted out\n\nIt began with an invitation to play Woodstock. Promoters and the audience expected the wild man they'd seen many times before.\n\nInstead, Hendrix put together a group that reflected his desire to create music with an emphasis on a groove, with a sound that reconnected him with black music.\n\nAccording to Sultan, Hendrix's manager did everything he could to undermine the guitarist's vision, even going out of his way to sabotage a television appearance by the new band.\n\nHendrix's problems didn't end with his manager. As the sounds of Woodstock faded, Hendrix found his past catching up with him in the form of an old management agreement he'd signed with one time manager, Ed Chalpin.\n\nThe answer was to deliver Capitol records an album of new songs. With his Woodstock band floundering and needing to fulfil the contract, he turned to his old army friend Billy Cox and former Electric Flag drummer, Buddy Miles, to play a concert that would be recorded to create the required record.\n\nHe called the group Band of Gypsys. The concerts they played at the Filmore East showcased a new song called Machine Gun with a political message that he announced by saying:\n\n\"We'd like to dedicate this one to such a daggy scene that's going on â€” all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam.\"\n\nNone of this went down well with his manager, who didn't like the politics, or the critics who said the other musicians simply weren't up to the job.\n\nMike Jeffery's answer was to book Hendrix on a punishing touring schedule including concerts halls and festivals. Onstage, the band struggled with sub-standard sound systems, while off-stage the festivals became battle grounds with audiences demanding free concerts and fighting with police.\n\nAs the year rolled on, Hendrix's frustration was evident. Privately, he told friends he wanted out of his contract with Mike Jeffery.\n\nThat wish would not be fulfilled because the manager held the publishing contract for the musician's songs and he was a joint partner in the recording studio Hendrix had built in New York. He was trapped.\n\nThe guitarist's frustration came to a head on a tour of Sweden just a few weeks before he died.\n\nOn the afternoon before his first concert, he swallowed a handful of sleeping tablets. Barely capable of walking, he made it on stage, played two songs and walked off. Back at his hotel, he slumped on the couch and told a journalist:\n\n\"I'm not sure I will live to be 28 years old. I mean, the moment I feel I have nothing more to give musically, I will not be around on the planet anymore, unless I have a wife and children; otherwise I've got nothing to live for.\"\n\nIt was an alarming statement for anyone listening. Clearly his manager wasn't. Just two weeks later Jimi Hendrix was dead.\n\nHow great could he have been?\n\nMany questions remain about his life and his death. Perhaps the most haunting is simply to ask what sort of music might he have given the world had he survived?\n\nHendrix himself told friends he had turned to classical music and hoped he could find musicians that he could write for and play with.\n\nIn the end â€” listening to the recordings he made before his death â€” there are tantalising glimpses of what might have been and always the sound of greatness.\n\nHow great? Perhaps the final word on that question should go to the man who carried the white guitar as a gift for Hendrix on that fateful night 50 years ago.\n\nBack in 1966, Eric Clapton had been the one who'd invited the then unknown musician on stage to jam with his band Cream.\n\nThe blues maestro, on hearing Hendrix play the song Killing Floor, immediately stopped playing and walked off stage.\n\nLighting a cigarette with a shaking hand, he turned to Jimi's manager Chas Chandler and said: \"You told me he was good, but you didn't tell me he was that fucking good.\"\n\nHe was, and he always will be."
