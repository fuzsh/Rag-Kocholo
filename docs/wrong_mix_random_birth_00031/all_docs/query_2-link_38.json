        "text": "When you look at the height of the classic rock era, you canâ€™t help but feel a little heartbroken over the amazing artist. We lost along the way. Legendary guitarists like Terry Kath and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThose two guitarists in particular really looked up to each other and both sadly left this world at too young of an age. Recently there have been photos going around claiming that Jimi Hendrix was on Mackinac Island just before his death.\n\nIn the photo posted on Facebook, it paints a very realistic picture, showing Jimi and one of his bandmates Noel Redding on the dock at Mackinaw Island:\n\nSeptember 7, 1970 - nine days before his death at age 27, the Jimi Hendrix Experience (Hendrix and Noel Redding, with Mitch Mitchell still aboard the ferry) arrive on Mackinac Island to play as an unannounced act for Grand Hotel's Labor Day Jazz Festival, Hendrix's second to the last time he played guitar in public [ Mackinac Babylon photo ]\n\nThis photo, however, is completely false. When you look at the photo you can sense that Jimi is completely out of place, and nobody seems to care the most famous guitarist in the world at the time is just...HANGING OUT on Mackinaw Island.\n\nAlso, these stills of them were taken right off another photo from the 21st of August, 1967 when Jimi and the band were at an airport in London. Also, the date does not add up. On September 7th, 1970, Jimi was in Germany which, according to my notes, is on the other side of the world and nowhere near Mackinaw Island."
