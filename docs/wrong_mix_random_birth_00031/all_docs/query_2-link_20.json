        "text": "Prologue – All the nonsense\n\nI know, this site is a record guide but this subject needs addressing as there is so much rubbish all over the internet about Jimi being murdered. It’s a long page but it was prepared with care to cover all bases. Another page (all about Mike Jeffery) follows it – link at the bottom of the page).\n\nI had read all the startling articles and books that implied that Jimi had been murdered but too many statements were very conflictual. So with an open mind, I decided to sift through all the information available, in an effort and determine what really happened.\n\nI’ve always preferred facts to lies and looking meticulously through all the data (and using plain old common sense) it’s plainly evident that the entire murder theory simply doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. The lies have now become part of Hendrix folklore and we have people all over social media declaring that “Hendrix was murdered by his manager”, “Jimi was a touring slave”, “Jeffery kidnapped Jimi, “Jeffery spiked Jimi at MSG”,…. all totally false as you will see here, but people seem to prefer the myth (or are simply ill-informed) and like to see Jimi as a bullied martyr. As the respected Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro put it in the book Electric Gypsy:\n\n“Again, there is no evidence for such conspiracy theories. As in life, so in death, there were too many people wanting to hold Jimi up as a ‘victim’, a martyr to his genius, done in by evil managers, record companies, hangers-on, dope-dealers, political militants and so on. True, like anybody else in the public eye, Jimi was under inordinate amounts of stress. But to deny him any inner resources of strength to win through, the belief in the power of his own vision and the ability to gain control over his life, is to do Jimi Hendrix a grave disservice.”… “In Gerry Stickell’s words, Jimi’s death was ‘an unfortunate accident’. And almost certainly, that’s what it was.”\n\nSo read on dear visitor and learn the truth about the death of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nI must say first of all that this page only came together thanks to all the painstaking research done over the years by Kathy Etchingham, Michael Fairchild, Caesar Glebbeek, Harry Shapiro, Jerry Hopkins, Tony Brown, Dennis Care, Charles R. Cross, Sharon Lawrence, Ben Valkhoff, Luigi Garuti and others. So thank you guys and gals for all your hard work and dedication. The various books listed in the bibliography at the foot of the page can still be found out there and Kathy’s book, though out of print (and expensive used) has a Kindle edition. Check out the neat assessment of this subject in the Valkhoff/Garuti book “Hendrix 1970: Day By Day”.\n\nConspiracy theory nonsense\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Jimi’s death have been subject to much speculation. Theories abound claiming that it was suicide, an accident and even quite ludicrously that it was a murder conspiracy, instigated by his manager Michael Jeffery! The 2021 events in Washington DC and QAnon disinformation illustrate the lunacy that is born out of conspiracy theory mentalities. Truth denial is becoming widespread, especially in the U.S.A. The same blind refusal of irrefutable facts has also taken hold within the Hendrix fan community over the years thanks to a succession of inaccurate information, blatant money-making lies and also the perverted desire to paint the musician as a helpless victim of the establishment and a machiavellian manager. For some reason, the gullible seem to prefer the tragic, romantic idea of Jimi the martyr to his art. In many cases, it’s not really their fault because so much of the nonsense has crept into several Hendrix books, documentaries and thus into Hendrix folklore. A lot of information-gathering, 20 years after Jimi’s passing, was done under very curious circumstances involving some highly untrustworthy individuals.\n\nAs you will see on this page, many of the people involved in that terrible day when Jimi passed away, give self-contradicting statements about what happened. For example, in his book “Hendrix: The Final Days”, Tony Brown mentions that he interviewed the key witness Monika Dannemann many times in the 80s and she would change her story from one call to the next! As you will see on this page, Jimi’s road crew, Eric Burdon, the ambulancemen, the doctors, a policeman (!),… also changed their stories as they went along, making amateur sleuthing a very difficult task!\n\nSo I realised that within this infuriating tangle of conflicting accounts, there must be a path to understanding what happened on that disastrous morning. The accounts couldn’t all be wrong or invented, and within them led a path to the truth. With this in mind, I set about looking for the accounts which complimented or eliminated another. I must say that this is all only based on the (confused) information that we have so far and the common sense deductions that can be made from it. <\n\nIf any further information becomes available (particularly about what happened at the Samarkand Hotel and the “clean-up” crew) then that would change a lot of assumptions on this page, and I have no problem with that.\n\nCause and effect\n\nAttempted suicide seems unlikely. There are many quotes saying that Jimi was depressed, confused and insecure at this stage (Sharon Lawrence and Kirsten Nefer in particular witnessed this) but others ( Mitch Mitchell, Alan Douglas, Gerry Stickells,…) said that Jimi was generally in good spirits and bursting with fresh ideas and looking forward to getting new projects under way!\n\nHe told Swedish journalist Jorn Rossing Jensen “I feel mentally hollowed.” and to Anne Bjorndal (Morgenposten newspaper) “I am not sure I will live to be 28 years old. I mean, the moment I feel I’ve got nothing more to give musically, I will not be around on this planet anymore, unless I have a wife and children; otherwise I’ve got nothing to live for…”\n\nWhen you read Sharon Lawrence’s book, it also seems that Jimi was very down during that time but Alan Douglas met Jimi in London in September 1970 and found him to be very happy: “No depression, no discontent, nothing. He knew about all the business problems and what everybody was doing, and he was just waiting it out so he could deal with music the way he really wanted to.” “That week he was at his happiest and funniest, and I had the best time I ever had with him.” (from Guitar World Magazine – September 1975).\n\nWhat is apparent however about Jimi’s last months is that his chosen lifestyle had become very erratic and unhealthy with poor sleep cycles and the consumption of great amounts of drugs and alcohol which had sent him into a spiral of paranoia, self-doubt, apathy and what appeared to amount to a bipolar disorder or even mild schizophrenia. Linda Keith: “He had huge mood swings that lasted days and I suspect today he would be diagnosed as bipolar.” (Mojo special 2023).\n\nCarlos Santana, who had witnessed Jimi’s excesses in November 1969 at The Record Plant, NY: “To me, it was a combination of the lifestyle – staying up all night, chicks, too much drugs, all kinds of stuff. It was a combination of all the intensities he felt, along with a lack of discipline.“(2).\n\nBuddy Miles: “To some degree, Hendrix suffered from the drugs he was taking, because he was doing heroin and after a while that will hurt anyone.” (10)\n\nJimi’s girlfriend Carmen Borrero on Jimi’s flirting with heroin: “He started playing with that through the nose.” (5)\n\nJimi’s friend Colette Mimram: “He liked creative drugs but he couldn’t stand heroin. He tried it but it wasn’t what he wanted to do.” (5)\n\nCharles C. Cross: “…in Hawaii, he broke a heroin dependency.” (5)\n\nBrian Auger talking about meeting Jimi in 1970: “…he rolled out some silver paper which he opened up and he snorted what was obviously heroin.” (from my interview with Brian – see Index page).\n\nDon Friedman (promotor of the Randall’s Island festival in 1970): “He was consuming drugs nonstop. He was mixing them. He was drinking. He was smoking grass and snorting coke. He may have had some heroin, because I know there was some in the room; several of those with him were heavily into it.” (12)\n\nReading about Jimi’s confused and unpredictable behaviour during his last few weeks is unsettling and it reveals a man who was gradually losing control. He had relished shooting to international stardom in 1967 and 1968 but Noel remarked how, even then, Jimi would often display anxiety and paranoia (perhaps a symptom of his unstable, violent childhood and his equally hap-hazard and anonymous “chitlin’ circuit” days).\n\nEventually the pressures of being the highest paid rock star of the day got to him. His life became a maelstrom of demands from record companies, management, banks, lawyers, radical groups, ex-lovers with children that he’d fathered, Ed Chalpin, drug pushers, hangers-on,… He couldn’t just run away from his responsibilities, his mounting debts, so he unfortunately was drawn to the escape of various substances, which put him in a very precarious situation. Being “Jimi” Hendrix had become intolerable for him.\n\nAs Tony Brown said in the preface of his book The Last Days: “Anyone with an ounce of common sense could see that Hendrix was heading for a terrible fall.“\n\nHarry Shapiro had this to say about Jimi’s condition when he arrived in London for the short European tour in August/September 1970: “Important… in assessing the events of the coming weeks is the fact that Jimi was physically very run down. His glandular problems earlier in the year were a testament to that and he never had or gave himself the time to recover fully. Jimi’s poor state of physical health was primarily a product of the lifestyle he led.”\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nWhen all the talk of Jimi being murdered started being put about decades ago, I was shocked and intrigued. So I just had to find out more. As I delved into all the interviews, articles, books, videos,… comparing all the data, it became obvious that many statements didn’t fit the undeniable facts, i.e. the medical information. Something didn’t add up and I discovered that a murder simply didn’t take place at all.\n\nIt became evident that it was imperative to start at the hospital, because the procedures that were carried out at that crucial moment tell us everything we need to know about Jimi’s condition.\n\nWorking logically back from those facts permits one to eliminate a great number of false and untrustworthy accounts (the murder, the long-dead Jimi, the lungs full of wine, etc. – all nonsense). So the solution is to begin with the inescapable fact that renders the murder theory immediately obsolete:\n\nSeptember 18th 1970:\n\nJimi certainly WASN’T long-dead on arrival at the hospital\n\nIn the afternoon of September 18th, the police and a hospital spokesperson confirmed to the press that Jimi had passed away in the ambulance (see the above quotes from the press articles). It was also confirmed by the Accident & Emergencies Admissions Officer (Walter Price) at the hospital and confirmed again in the 1990s by the ambulanceman who was at Jimi’s side as the ambulance sped to the hospital with lights and siren according to the driver – so there was obviously a sense of urgency, a living patient. At the November 1970 inquest into Jimi’s death, it was also confirmed that Jimi died in the ambulance.\n\nThis was the reason why, on arrival at the hospital, Jimi was rushed to the Resuscitation Room (or Emergencies Room) in a last ditch attempt to revive him. This simple fact eliminates the popular myth that Jimi had been dead for hours at the Samarkand Hotel. The function of the Resuscitation Room is to perform CPR on people who have just stopped breathing (you’ve seen it movies) and have no pulse BUT might still have a chance of being resuscitated, before the point of no return – brain death. Doctors NEVER attempt to revive long-dead corpses that are six or seven hours gone, simply because of the visible signs of livor mortis (a.k.a. “dependent lividity” – skin discoloration) and rigor mortis (stiffness of the jaw, neck, limbs,…) which would inform them that the person is completely irrecuperable. Lividity can show up in as little as 15 minutes, so if Jimi had been dead for hours, skin discoloration would have been plainly visible to medical personnel. It obviously wasn’t the case.\n\nPrior to admission, arrivals are always triaged and bodies exhibiting such signs are sent directly to the morgue. Jimi obviously exhibited none because the two doctors who examined him in the ambulance decided that he be rushed into the Emergencies Room for immediate resuscitation.\n\nThis simple fact has been somewhat overlooked for decades.\n\nJimi certainly didn’t drown in red wine\n\nA doctor who was on duty the morning that Jimi died received a lot of publicity in the press when he said that he had pumped pints of red wine out of Jimi’s stomach and lungs. He said “The medical staff used an 18 inch metal sucker to try and clear Hendrix’s airway…but it would just fill up with red wine from his stomach”.\n\nThe problem with his story is that at the autopsy, a half-digested meal still in Jimi’s stomach. If his stomach had been pumped, how could a half-digested meal remain for the autopsy? Also, no wine was found to be among that half-digested meal, none at all was mentioned in the autopsy report. Vomit was also found in Jimi’s lungs at the autopsy – which would have been impossible if his lungs had been full of pints of wine (which was all pumped out according to Bannister and his conspiracy theorist fans). Lungs that had been flooded with wine would have left a trace, a residue. None was found at the autopsy.\n\nAll of this shows that the account of Dr. Bannister is pure invention (or the memory of a different case). If we follow Bannister’s account more closely, that wine suctioning was done on another person entirely. Read on.\n\nBannister said that he had a vivid memory of the case. He told two newspapers that the body he watched being worked on was “very long” and that “He was about 10 inches (25.4 centimetres) longer than the trolley”! Hospital trolleys are 6’6″ in length in order to take a fully grown adult, so if the man’s feet were sticking out about 10″ off the end, that would mean a man over 7 feet tall. Jimi was only 5’10” tall! Further proof that Bannister’s account has nothing whatsoever to do with Jimi Hendrix.\n\nHow to explain these lies (or memories of a different case)? It transpired that Bannister was on trial for fraud when he came forward with his ludicrous comments in the 1990s! At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted and struck-off the register as a doctor. So the whole nonsense looks like an attention-grabbing exercise. More about that further down.\n\nThe autopsy\n\nDr. Teare (a Pathologist of The Department of Forensic Medicine at St. George’s Hospital, Westminster) performed the Post Mortem analysis of Jimi’s body. He begins by describing Jimi as a “Well nourished and muscular young adult man.” This reminded me of what Jimi’s road manager Eric Barrett said in Chris Welch’s book: “I never really saw any changes in him during the time I knew him, except that he looked healthier.” Barrett worked for Jimi from 1968 right to the end.\n\nIn the report Dr. Teare states that the cause of death was “inhalation of vomit” and not drowning. Medical authorities understand the difference (unlike the conspiracy theorists). Dr. Teare said of his autopsy at the inquest: “…he had vomit in his air passages.”\n\nThe Coroner’s summing up\n\nFrom Gavin B. Thurston’s typed report: “The cause of death was clearly inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication.”\n\nThe 2016 autopsy review brought further proof – no murder and no wine in Jimi’s lungs\n\nI’ll put this up now to save you a lot of time dear reader. First of all, back in October 1970, the inquest was told that Jimi passed away in the ambulance on the way to the hospital – so this is an established fact. Then in the 90s, during a Scotland Yard reinvestigation into Jimi’s death, pathologist Dr. Rufus Crompton went over the original Post-Mortem report about the stomach contents and he came to the conclusion that Jimi’s time of death was at the same time as stated in the initial report (and not seven to eight hours earlier as the conspiracy theorist likes to think).\n\nFor a second opinion, the police took steps to contact another eminent pathologist and he also confirmed the originally stated time of death.\n\nThen, in 2016, 46 years after Jimi’s passing, Prof. Robert Donald Teare’s original Post-Mortem report was analysed by the highly experienced forensic pathologist Dr. Michael D. Hunter (who has performed over 4000 autopsies to determine cause of death and has testified in several serious criminal trials).\n\nDr. Hunter’s detailed report was presented on the ReelzTV documentary titled “Autopsy – The Last Hours Of Jimi Hendrix”. Over the decades since Jimi’s death, forensic science has greatly evolved and using this accumulated knowledge, Dr. Hunter goes step by step through every aspect of the 1970 autopsy report to reach his conclusion. Also taken into account are some details about Jimi’s last couple of weeks in Europe. Despite the rather tacky, prime-time presentation (and some factual errors about Jimi regarding the events of his last few days in London), the documentary finally provides the irrefutable proof that Jimi Hendrix didn’t drown in wine.\n\nRelating to the conspiracy fantasy that Jimi had been forcibly water-boarded with red wine, Dr. Hunter says that such an aggression would have been revealed in the autopsy by “an elevated level of alcohol in the blood”. This means that the relatively short time of such struggling/drowning is long enough for the fine membranes of the mouth, the nasal cavity, the stomach and the lungs to absorb alcohol in great quantities. Also, if Jimi had lain on the bed for 6 hours with pints of wine inside his lungs and stomach (as the conspiracy theorist claims), alcohol would have seeped through the membranes by natural diffusion (osmosis) into the blood. In his typed report, Prof. Teare had stated “Analysis for ethanol [alcohol] failed to reveal more than 5 mg%.”*. Dr. Hunter points out that that low level is not compatible with drowning in wine.\n\n* The “5 mg%” mention was referred to simply because it was the minimum level of intoxication for a drink/driving offence.\n\nDr. Teare had also stated that Jimi had “100 mg per 100 ml of alcohol in his blood at the time he took the pills.” That alcohol was fully digested during the hours leading up to Jimi’s death in the ambulance and was found in Jimi’s urine at the autopsy (none left in the blood).\n\nAt the inquest, Dr. Teare had been more specific: “100 mil. % alcohol in urine but none in his blood”. The PROOF that Jimi didn’t drown in wine.\n\nAs said earlier, there wasn’t a trace of wine in the fluids that were found in Jimi’s lungs and stomach during Professeur Teare’s original autopsy in September 1970, only vomit.\n\nDr. Hunter also states that if Jimi forcibly drowned in wine, there would be visible signs of struggle/injury, but there were none at all on Jimi. “There’s no evidence of injury on him…. We can pretty much rule out that there is inflicted trauma that resulted in the death…”.\n\nThe real cause of death – sleeping pills and a “black bomber”\n\nDr. Hunter says that Jimi’s heart dilation could have been caused by drug consumption. The autopsy revealed no presence of chemicals that would indicate consumption of LSD, heroin or cocaine but there was a trace of the amphetamine Durophet (street name “Black Bomber”) in Jimi’s urine (given to Jimi by Devon at Pete Kameron’s party) and the presence in Jimi’s blood of the barbiturate quinalbarbitone (from Monika Dannemann’s Vesparax sleeping tablets). Hunter sees the latter as being the actual cause of Jimi’s death saying “I have no doubt that Vesparax is what killed Jimi” and that the inhalation of vomit was not the reason why he died. Jimi’s lungs did inhale vomit but only after the brain had been fatally damaged by the chemicals in the Vesparax tablets – “Jimi Hendrix died, not as a result of him choking on vomit but of polydrug toxicity” which “led to his respiratory failure and his death”.\n\nIn summing up, Dr. Hunter says that from evidence that is there, “we can discount murder.” – just as Dr. Rhufus Compton stated to the BBC in the 90s: “There is no villain” (8).\n\nWater-boarding? Utter nonsense.\n\nIt’s very bizarre that the conspiracy theorist thinks that Jimi died through water-boarding with wine, especially when water-boarding is… a method of torture, not murder!\n\nIt’s a long, drawn-out torture technique and would have left a very obvious criminal footprint – blatant incriminating evidence at the crime scene. No supposed “hit-men” would ever adopt such a messy, easily detectable technique to murder someone. Water-boarding would have left the bed soaked in red wine and we know that when the police visited the flat on the afternoon of the 18th, they found the place to be clean and they even took bedsheets for analysis, so they were obviously soiled. Obviously there was no trace of wine all over the place.\n\nIf anyone had wanted Jimi killed, the perfect crime would have been an overdose injection of heroin for example, which would have gone unnoticed as a crime because of Jimi’s reputation as a drug-taker (not to mention his trial for heroin possession in Toronto a year earlier – for which he was acquited luckily)!\n\nWhat the conspiracy theorist doesn’t understand is that if the intention had been to murder Jimi at the hotel, the murderers would have expected the body to be discovered there and that the police would be summoned. Their water-boarding murder would have been discovered! They couldn’t possibly have imagined that Jimi would be rushed into Casualty at a random hospital for urgent resuscitation!\n\nSo the conspiracy theorist idea that the medical staff at St. Mary Abbot’s and the police were already giving false accounts to the press (as part of a “cover-up”) on the very afternoon that Jimi died is utterly ludicrous.\n\nWhatever, all this “drowning in wine” is nonsense because we have the forensic proof that Jimi didn’t drown in wine at all. As stated above, no wine was seen or detected in Jimi’s body except a little in his urine. What does the conspiracy theorist think? That Bannister flushed Jimi out, then slipped some vomit back inside Jimi? Game over. No wine, no drowning, no murder. Case closed (but I’ll carry on).\n\nJimi’s manager didn’t have a life insurance policy on Hendrix\n\nAnother popular myth. It was Warner Brothers who had drawn up a policy for Jimi (just as they did for all top artists signed to their label) and they would have been the beneficiaries, not Jeffery or anybody else. We have it from good authority (Bob Levine) that Jefferey had tried to get Jimi to sign another life insurance policy but Jimi confirmed that he didn’t sign it (because at the time, he was trying to reduce his ties with his manager).\n\nJimi’s manager wasn’t an ex-MI5/MI6 special agent\n\nAnother fantasy served up for the gullible is that Mike Jeffery was a high-ranking British secret service agent, a spy during his army days. During his 60s/70s music business career, Jeffery was known for his dodgy methods, as being a scheming, ruthless businessman and skilled money-maker. He liked to use methods of intimidation and would brag that he used to be an MI6 operative. The conspiracy theorist prefers to simply trust in Mike Jeffery’s word (of all people). However, detailed research has revealed that he in fact was nothing more than a regular soldier who never rose above the very low rank of Private! Even Jimi attained the higher rank of Private First Class! Jeffery was in fact the Royal Army Education Corps, which was part of the Intelligence Corps. Research has also revealed that while in service, he spent his time on making money schemes such as re-selling newspapers to other servicemen and was even caught out.\n\nThe “Jimi was worked like a slave till he dropped” nonsense\n\nIt’s as if there is a desire among some Hendrix fans and conspiracy lovers to portray Jimi as a weak victim of Jeffery’s machiavellian manipulations, driven to tour until he dropped, worked to death etc. All utter rubbish as it turns out.\n\nIf you look at the timeline, there were only heavy touring periods in the early promotional days of 1967 (as with any band of the era) and a dense period in early 1968 (USA promotion), all of which Jimi loved according to his manager Chas Chandler.\n\nAfter that climb to the top, Jimi toured far less and he made sure that tour gigs were grouped around weekends in order to leave himself time to chill and create during the week. After the last Experience gig in June ’69, Jimi took 10 months (!) off touring and returned in April ’70 for a well-planned (weekends) tour of the States before yet another month without touring, which included a 10-day holiday on the island of Maui! Billy Cox said in a 2022 interview that Jeffery had even made plans for Jimi and the band to spend the month of July on Maui for “R&R”! As said, Jimi only spent 10 days there.\n\nWhen a short tour of Europe came up in September 1970 (only about 10 gigs planned), Jimi was in poor mental shape to cope with it, thanks to his reckless, drug and alcohol crazed lifestyle – however, as pointed out, it wasn’t as if he had been on a gruelling tour schedule prior to that (not since 1968 in fact). While in Europe for that tour, Jimi ordered is road manager Gerry Stickells to organise further tour dates. Also, when Billy Cox fell ill (nervous breakdown), Jeffery proposed to fly the band and crew to Spain for a rest, while they discussed the recruitment of a new bassist and the reconfiguration of the cancelled dates.\n\nSo it is clear hat Jimi was hardly the touring slave that he has become pictured as.\n\nThe web of lies and twisted motivations\n\nOver the decades, so many Hendrix biographers have unfortunately been misled by inaccurate information relating to Jimi’s tragic death. So people merely trusted the books, trusted Bannister. As I will detail below, all the false information stems specifically from the highly suspect accounts of the Dee Mitchell piloted interviews (her fake maiden name was Diana Bonham-Carter), ex-Dr. Bannister’s ludicrous account and roadie Tappy Wright’s (self-confessed) lies.\n\nTo see things more clearly, it is important to look at the sequence of events in detail, to give a better picture of Jimi’s irresponsible and reckless lifestyle and what actually happened on September 17th and 18th 1970.\n\nMonika Dannemann who was with Jimi when he fell into a coma at her rented London flat at The Samarkand Hotel.\n\nOver the years, she spread ridiculous confusion about what actually happened on September 18th 1970,\n\neither through shame or in an effort to shift responsibility towards Jimi.\n\nSo there are the essential facts, to get a clearer picture of what happened.\n\nSummer 1970 – Jimi returns to Europe\n\nJerry Hopkins wrote in his book “Hit & Run – The Jimi Hendrix Story”: “Cocaine or amphetamines started the day, barbiturates or heavy downers like heroin or Quaaludes ended the day, and in between came the recreational drugs: beer and wine and Scotch, LSD, pot, hash, peyote, soma, mushrooms, mescaline, and speedballs made of smack and coke.”\n\nBuddy Miles in the same book: “In those days [1969/1970] he was out there. He just didn’t care… Jimi was into acid heavily at that time, almost every day. Grass, hash, coke, booze, everything. He was a glutton. I hate to say that, but you have to be truthful.”\n\nThat gives some idea of where Jimi’s head was through in 1969/1970.\n\nWorking on his fourth studio album (two years after he’d worked on Electric Ladyland), Jimi was finally making progress by the summer of 1970. However, because of all the problems with the Ed Chalpin case, the lack of touring from mid 1969 to spring 1970, his overspending and the escalating costs of the construction of Electric Lady Studios, the Hendrix organisation was very short of money. So to bring in more funds, a short tour of Europe was organised. There was no other way to bring in funds because Jimi’s fourth album was still being worked on.\n\nThe evening before Jimi left for Europe, he attended the launch party for Electric Lady Studios. He was up all night drinking and smoking and didn’t get any sleep at all. Road manager Eric Barrett flew to London with Jimi and he said that they were still drunk when they arrived at Heathrow Airport. He also got no sleep that first night in London. (12)\n\nRobbie Krieger says in his autobiography that he was next to Jimi on the plane to London for the Isle of Wight festival in August 1970 (The Doors also played there of course) and he remembers that Jimi asked him if he knew where to score drugs in England and to call him if he managed to score (and Jimi wasn’t talking about marijuana according to Krieger).\n\nAs soon as Jimi arrived in London, Kathy Etchingham got a panicked call from Angie Burdon, telling her that Jimi had gone mad. Angie recounted (to Kathy Etchingham) that she and another girl (who?) had been having fun with Jimi who suddenly snapped. He violently banged the girls heads together and smashed up the hotel suite then threw the naked girls out of his bedroom, trapping them in the sitting room.\n\nKathy dashed over there and found a dilapidated Jimi in bed with a fever and with the fire full-on (even though it was a hot day at the time). Kathy recounted that Jimi complained of having a bad cold and that he looked very ill with a cold fever. In 1996, she embellished that a little, telling Musician magazine “He was suffering from a reactive depression from all the problems he had.” In her book, Kathy said: “…it is obvious he was suffering some kind of withdrawal symptoms…” which might well have been from heroin. In his book Charles C. Cross mentions that Jimi had kicked his heroin habit during his 10-day holiday in Hawaii (mid August 1970) because he kept his drug-pushing girlfriend Devon Wilson away. Had he really managed to kick the habit?\n\nJimi’s Post Mortem report gave clues about Jimi’s condition. It revealed that he had a dilated right side of the heart so from what the autopsy says and the fact that Jimi complained of having an unshakable “cold” in the last fortnight of his life.\n\nDoctor Michael D. Hunter (in his 2016 autopsy review) ruled out rheumatic fever but said “It’s possible, given Jimi’s symptoms, that the dilation that we see with his heart is a response to a viral infection.” So Jimi could well have been suffering from the flu.\n\nTo combat the infection, the jet-lag, the lack of sleep, Jimi had three nights ahead of him to get some rest before the Isle Of Wight gig but instead, thrilled to back in good old London where his fame and fortune had begun, he went into full-on party mode.\n\nIn the many interviews with Jimi over the following few days he’d tell one interviewer that he was excited about the many projects that he had on the boiler (his new studio, forming a bigger band, writing a symphony, playing with Gil Evans and Roland Kirk,…) then the next day he’d say to another interviewer “…I feel that I have nothing more to give musically.” Clearly opposite states of mind at the same time. Linda Keith said (in the 2023 Mojo Hendrix special) that she met Jimi the night before he flew to the Isle Of Wight and that he seemed depressed and wanted to move into a new phase of his career. So it’s evident that Jimi was hungry for change.\n\nThe Isle Of Wight Festival and following short tour\n\nOn the evening of August 30th, Folk musician Ralph Mctell recounted that at the Isle Of Wight festival, Jimi was due to be on stage but couldn’t be located. He was eventually found “very out of it in somebody’s garden” near the festival site, according to McTell (7). However, biographer Philip Norman says in his book that was just confusion and that Jimi simply was resting in one of the backstage caravans.\n\nBefore going on stage, Roy Carr of the N.M.E. said that Jimi “shared a catering-size bottle of vodka with friends and journalists” (7). Festival MC Jeff Dexter said “I went out to introduce Jimi, and he said ‘Hang on, I’m not ready’. It took him about 40 minutes to get himself together. He was in a state.” The festival DJ and co-MC Jeff Dexter said of Jimi’s condition “He seemed a bit out of it….a little confused, not in total good nick.” (15)\n\nHis performance at the festival from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. was shambolic and lacklustre (the band hadn’t played together at all since the Hawaii gigs a month earlier). Jimi looked drawn and exhausted. Mitch later confirmed in his autobiography “…it was stupid that we didn’t have some kind of play before IOW. In actual fact we’d been playing quite well on the road [in the U.S.] but to go out cold was a mistake. We were rusty and it showed….whatever the reason was, it was just a lousy performance… I remember we were all really brought down by our performance.”.\n\nRichie Havens met Jimi backstage and was shocked how ill he looked: “He looked like he’d been up for days.” Jimi told Havens about how stressed he was about his music business troubles.\n\nJimi came off stage at the Isle Of Wight at something like 4 a.m. Some eyewitnesses said that Jimi collapsed when he came off stage. He headed for a hotel for some much needed rest, as he was due to play the same day in Stockholm! So did he go and get a good night’s sleep?… not exactly: Jimi’s chauffeur Derek Dyer went to the hotel room a few hours later to take Jimi to the airport and saw that there were two young girls (“…must have been about 16 or 17, I suppose…”) in his bed. (8).\n\nThe evening of that day, Jimi played in Tivoli Gardens, Stockholm and before taking the stage, he was seen to down a bottle of whisky like it was water (8). Noel: “You have to see the film made in Stockholm to believe it. I’d never seen Jimi looking so drunk on stage before.” (Noel was referring to the hand-held black and white video camera footage of parts of the gig). Another patchy performance ensued.\n\nThis was followed by a shoddy performance at Gothenburg. Chas Chandler attended that concert and found Jimi to be a shadow of his former self: “He was wrecked…it was really awful to watch…no discipline at all there.” (11)\n\nAfter the gig he was seen (by Hendrix fan Lars Olssen) leaving with “…one gorgeous-looking girl on his left and another on his right arm.” (1)\n\nIt was after the Gothenburg gig that Cox went to his hotel room and was tempted to try LSD (2). Another account said that he’d drank some punch that had some LSD in the mix. This sent Billy into a spiral of paranoia. Jimi spent the night with one of his many girlfriends Birgitta Moberg, who took a photo of Jimi sleeping, which the ill-informed take to be a photo of Jimi dead.\n\nThe next night came the catastrophic Aarhus gig. When Jimi arrived at the Hotel before the gig, people noticed that he didn’t look well and he was trembling and sweating a lot. He took a handful of downers (Mandrax) to help him to sleep but instead, a stoned and rambling Jimi gave interviews to various journalists (check out the Valkhoff/Garuti 1970: Day By Day book to read the interviews). He told journalist Anne Bjorndal that he was thinking of cancelling the concert. He told another (Hasse Boe) that he hadn’t slept for three days (it’s perfectly clear that his exhaustion had nothing to do with fictional non-stop touring).\n\nHis girlfriend Kirsten Nefer joined Jimi there and described the pitiful state he was in, staggering and rambling about flying saucers. He insisted that she held his hand during the interviews. Kirsten said she was embarrassed about Jimi’s condition.\n\nGerry Stickells remarked how exhausted Jimi was, due to his flu, lack of sleep, drug taking, drinking and partying. He told the organisers that Jimi was too tired to play but they refused to accept it. Remember, this was only day three of the tour (after Jimi’s had had a month off touring including a 10-day holiday in Hawaii).\n\nJimi had to fulfil the contract that he’d committed to. Eye-witnesses said that before the show, Jimi swallowed a handful of sleeping pills (surely his own downers). He had to be helped onto the stage by the roadies. Then a totally wrecked Jimi abandoned the performance after just two songs. He was helped virtually bent-double back to his dressing room (2). Backstage, the concert manager said that Jimi collapsed in his arms and that he had that cold fever. Jimi asked the organisers if they had any cocaine – they had none). Then, instead of finally getting a good night’s sleep, he told his girlfriend of the moment (Kirsten Nefer) that he wanted to talk to her all night. Which they did. In Charles C. Cross’s book she recounts how Jimi rambled and displayed instant mood changes. He said he wouldn’t live past 28 and that he had nothing left to give musically and nothing left to live for unless he had a wife and children. He asked her to marry him (he’d do the same to Monika Dannemann shortly afterwards.\n\nNext up was a gig in Copenhagen, where against all odds, he put on a fantastic performance – one of the best concerts of his career! Before the gig, Kirsten Nefer had taken Jimi home to meet her mother. He had a much needed nap and was given a good meal. This gave Jimi a boost and he played brilliantly at the evening concert. Mitch told Nefer that Jimi hadn’t played that well for years (5). However, before that show, Kirsten said that he’d had a panic attack, locking himself in the dressing room and it took some persuading to get him to go out and perform. Obviously, things were not right in Jimi’s head.\n\nThe following Berlin show was much weaker. Journalist Jörg Flemming remarked “The brilliant magician with the guitar seems exhausted and uninspired… he even forgets his lyrics. He plays as if he’s drunk…”. The next day, Flemming watched Jimi listening to a tape of the performance, repeating to himself “I wasn’t good.” (1)\n\nAnother journalist saw Jimi sniffing and asked if he had a cold. “That’s from snorting, Man.” was Jimi’s reply.\n\nPrior to the concert Jimi told Flemming “In America I was on the road every day for five months…” which of course wasn’t true because he’d played 27 concerts over the 150 days of that period (an average of about 5 gigs a month!) and he’d had a 10 day holiday in Hawaii in August! – see Timeline\n\nBecause of Billy’s worsening condition, Jimi told Jörg Flemming “Berlin and Fehmarn are my last concerts. After that I need a break in London.”\n\nJohn Hiseman of the band Coliseum: “I was with him on the band bus that took the musicians from the airport to the Fehmarn Festival, in North Germany….He was completely gone, completely out of his head on drugs.” Source\n\nHis performance at the Fehmarn pop festival was an improvement but the occasion was marred by bad weather and trouble with aggressive Hells Angels. Billy’s was in a bad way and after the concert he was even hospitalised and given the strong sedative Thorazine. He was then flown back to the states and the rest of the tour was suspended, while the Hendrix crew tried to find a replacement bass player. Noel Redding was called but unfortunately he failed to respond before it was too late. If contact with Noel had been established, the chain of events would have been entirely different. As it was, the tour ground to a halt, leaving further dates simply cancelled.\n\nKaren Davis (a friend of Jimi and Kirsten) about the final days of the short, aborted European tour:“Jimi was acting a bit out of it. He was taking a lot of Mandrax and drinking a lot.”(6) Mandrax (also known as “Mandies”) were strong sedatives/sleeping pills that were highly addictive and banned in 1977. So even before the Samarkand incident, Jimi was downing sedatives with alcohol.\n\nBack to London\n\nRight after the Fehmarn Island concert (September 6th), Jimi and the crew flew back to London. Mitch said “When we go back to London, Jimi seemed depressed.” (1) He went back to the Londonderry Hotel but he was turned away because of the incident with the two girls nine days earlier, so he checked into the Cumberland Hotel instead (11). He didn’t sleep there however, preferring to stay at Debbie Tooney’s Fulham flat (an American friend that he’d met through a friend at the Speakeasy).\n\nKeith Altman interviewed Jimi for the BBC at The Cumberland: “I’d say he was fragile [but] I didn’ find him a depressed state. In fact he was very positive about what he wanted to do. I didn’ find him in a suicidal frame of mind.” (1) It’s clear that Jimi was subject to extreme mood swings.\n\nHe spent a week flitting around town with Kirsten Nefer (and a party at his hotel room on the 13th with Angie Burdon and others present) but from the night of Tuesday, September 15th (after Nefer left for a film role with future James Bond actor George Lazenby) his sleeping hours were spent at a basement apartment of the Samarkand Hotel in Notting Hill, which was being rented by yet another girlfriend named Monika Dannemann. Jimi in fact often used his many girlfriend’s places to escape from the pressure of fans or even his own entourage and management. Apparently, his baggage was at The Cumberland hotel but as always, he had a guitar with him – his favourite “Black Beauty” Strat.\n\nJimi had met first Dannemann in January 1969 while in Dusseldorf. When he flew to England in March 1970 (to try and persuade Kathy Etchingham not to marry Ray Mayer) he called Monika, asking her to see him in London but she was ill and couldn’t make the trip. September 1970 and Jimi renewed contact with her.\n\nVarious reports state that Jimi had proposed marriage to at least three girls around this time: Kirsten Nefer, Monika Dannemann and his Swedish girlfriend Catherina! Jimi was seemingly desperate to find a close companion in his life. Kirsten Nefer said in an interview “Jimi really wanted to get married” but she was aware that Jimi must have said this to many girls. The press got hold of this and blew it all out of proportion, saying that they actually were engaged – which Kirsten firmly denied.\n\nOne of Jimi’s long-term American girlfriends, the possessive and dominating “super groupie” Devon Wilson, heard that Jimi was dating Nefer and was furious. She flew to London on the 12th (with Alan and Stella Douglas) and proceeded to phone Jimi, telling him off. Nefer was witness to this (11).\n\nMonday, September 14th: Daniel Secunda (a Track Records director) said that on that day he dined with Jimi, Alan Douglas and his wife Stella and Devon Wilson and that “Jimi and the girls were so smacked out they barely ate anything or said a word.” Jimi spent the night at Secunda’s flat, in bed with Devon and Stella (according to Secunda).\n\nJournalist Sharon Lawrence was apparently quite a close friend of Jimi’s and she recounts in her book (“Jimi Hendrix: The Man, The Magic, The Truth”) that she met Jimi at Ronnie Scott’s Club (on the night of Tuesday, September 15th) where Eric Burdon & War had a short residency. She describes him as being in a sorry state, not even recognising her for a while! “His face was ashen and his brown eyes appeared exhausted and even frightened. Never had I seen him like this… he said. “Oh Sharon.” He gazed at me and he muttered, “I’m almost gone.”\n\nJimi’s poor condition was confirmed by Burdon and his band saying that Jimi looked “smacked out”. Burdon’s roadie Terry Slater said that Jimi looked disorientated. (11) . Burdon in his book “I Used To Be An Animal”: “He had his guitar with him and was wobbling too much to play.” They politely invited him to come back the next day.\n\nJimi talks to Chas\n\nIt’s said that on Wednesday the 16th of September, Jimi visited Chas Chandler at his Upper Berkeley Street flat (which they had shared for a while in the early London days). Or did he? In an interview with Record Mirror (26/09/1970) Chas said “Last time I saw Jimi was about three months ago, when he called round to my flat. But I spoke to him on the Wednesday before he died.” So perhaps Jimi only phoned Chas on the 16th. Monika is quoted in the book Electric Gypsy saying that Jimi had given Chas the phone number of his ‘secret’ address because he wanted to discuss the idea of Chas managing him (that would mean simply creative management, as before, and not business management, which was purely Jeffery’s domain).\n\nChas had told other journalists that the physical meeting with Jimi had happened back in March (which was in fact when Jimi had been in London briefly).\n\nIn Chris Welch’s book, Chas is again quoted: “I never heard any more about him for three months until two days before he died. He asked me to produce for him again. He rang me again on the Thursday and we got to discussing the design for a cover.” So it definitely looks like they didn’t meet during that final week.\n\nFrom that Record Mirror interview with Chas: “I’d been talking to his lawyer, who is also mine in America [Henry W. Steingarten], and there was talk about my producing him again. From what I hear, there is a lot of Hendrix material available, but it was just that he wasn’t too happy with the way some of it had worked out. That’s where the talks started.” Jimi asked Chas if he could help him beat the new album into shape and he planned to transfer the master tapes from Electric Lady Studios to Olympic. The two planned to meet up the following week to get things moving. However, in the 90s, Chas said he never said those things to the press (about meeting with Jimi in March)! Hells bells.\n\nConfirmation that Jimi had proposed to Monika?\n\nIn the afternoon (or evening according to Monika), they went to a party at Dick Fontaine’s house for Judy Wong’s birthday party. Wong confirmed that Jimi announced to her that he and Monika were going to get married (11).\n\nSly Stone was in London for a gig at The Lyceum on Wednesday evening and Jim Capaldi was in a box with Traffic and he’s said that he met Devon Wilson there. She said that Jimi would be along too but he never showed up. However, Eric Clapton was there and he has said that he saw Jimi in another box at the show. He had brought a gift for Jimi with him (a left-handed Stratocaster) but unfortunately he didn’t manage to meet Jimi after the show).\n\nThen Jimi went again to Ronnie Scott’s (with Monika) and jammed with Eric Burdon & War (the show was taped, eventually surfacing on bootlegs).\n\nIn her book and the many interviews, Monika Dannemann painted quite a rosy picture of Jimi’s last couple of days on planet Earth but even though Jimi had proposed marriage to her (as he’d also done to two other girls!), it is evident from the various eye-witness accounts that things weren’t going at all well between them.\n\nWhat follows of events on Thursday, September 17 right up to the fateful morning of the 18th.\n\nPhillip Harvey, the son of the late British politician Lord Harvey of Prestbury and member of the Parliament for the Conservative party, wrote a detailed affidavit (which emerged in 1995 after the death of Harvey’s father) stating that Harvey and a couple of female friends spent some time with Jimi and Monika at Harvey’s home at 4, Clarkes Mews on the evening of the 17th.\n\nThis is important information as it gives us clues to Monika’s character and state of mind.\n\nIn the late afternoon/early evening, Harvey was driving through London in his left-hand drive 1968 Mustang with a girl named Beth Riley in the front seat with him. At the traffic lights, the girl saw Jimi in Monika’s car and waved. Jimi waved back. According to Riley, Harvey recognised Monika as being an old school friend! He invited Monika and Jimi to his home for a drink but first they followed Jimi to the Cumberland Hotel where he dropped off his shopping, checked his messages and spoke to Mitch Mitchell on the phone. They then followed Harvey to his nearby home, where another girl joined them. Harvey described most of the time spent with Hendrix as “remarkably pleasant” but Dannemann was anti-social and later became violently hostile. The following is an excerpt from Phillip Harvey’s affidavit:\n\n“With the exception of Monika who, as the evening progressed, appeared to me to become more and more upset, we had been having a remarkably pleasant evening, happy and interested in each other’s company. Then about 10:00pm at a particular moment when Jimi had gone to the downstairs cloakroom, Monika quite suddenly, and for no particular apparent reason, got up and stormed down the four steps leading from the reception room, through the double glass doors, past the door to the cloakroom, down the hall and out of the front door into the mews, shouting as she left, “I’m leaving! I’m leaving now! I’ve had enough!” Jimi, who had obviously heard something, quickly came out of the cloakroom and back into the reception room. I explained to him briefly what had happened. He looked at us in a most embarrassed way and raised his eyebrows to the ceiling. He said, “I’d better go and see what’s wrong with her.” He then followed her out into the mews leaving the front door ajar.\n\nIn the kitchen and the hall at the front of the house, I could hear Monika out in the mews shouting at Jimi at the top of her voice, even though the individual words themselves were indistinct. There was even some noise in the reception room at the back of the house. At one point, when Monika’s screaming reached a particular prolonged high peak, I went to the front door to see what was happening. I was genuinely concerned that blows might be struck, and I was also worried that the loud screaming might provoke a complaint to the police from the management of the King Edward VI hospital on the other side of the mews directly opposite the house.\n\nJimi was just standing quietly there in the mews while Monika verbally assaulted him in the most offensive possible way. As I approached them, I remember hearing her shout at him, “You fucking pig!” I interrupted them and suggested that they should come back into the house as I didn’t want the police called. Monika simply carried on shouting at Jimi, telling me viciously to mind my own business. She didn’t seem to care less that she might be disturbing the neighbourhood or, indeed, making a public spectacle of herself. In fact, Clarkes Mews is very quiet, especially at night, and I saw no sign of anybody else in the vicinity. I went back inside the house, leaving the front door open ajar so that they could come back inside the house if they wanted to.\n\nMonika’s haranguing of Jimi continued in my best estimation for about half an hour. I went outside one further time to try and cool things down, and to see if anybody else’s attention had been attracted to the scene, but Monika’s shouting was at such a pitch that I decided not to interfere again. While I did not personally see any blows struck and Jimi, on two occasions I went outside, looked remarkably calm given the viciousness of Monika’s language, the violence in her voice and posture would suggest to me that she might well have struck him during the extended scene. I was actually quite worried that Monika might resort to serious physical violence, but Jimi appeared to me to be a fit man and I thought that, on balance, he was probably quite capable of looking after himself, and I had only just met them earlier that day and didn’t know any details about their relationship.\n\nAt about 10:30 pm Jimi came back into the house alone, and walked into the reception room where Penny, Anne and I were still wondering what was going to happen next. He apologised profusely for Monika’s behaviour and said he was very embarrassed. He said he didn’t really know what was wrong with her but she had obviously had too much to drink. He said that Monika refused to come back into the house and that, as he couldn’t abandon her, he would have to leave with her. He said that my house at 4 Clarkes Mews was the nicest scene he had found in London and that he would definitely visit us again when he got back from the USA which he thought would be in a few weeks’ time…He thanked the two girls and myself for our generous hospitality. I saw him out into the mews and he left with Monika driving the car. Monika was still screaming at Jimi as they left and she did not say a word to me. The time was about 10:40pm.”\n\nIt’s not clear if Jimi and Monika actually stayed at Harvey’s till around 10:30. Monika later said that they returned to the Samarkand between 8 and 8:30 pm. In an article in The Daily Telegraph in 2010, journalist Bryony Gordon said that the mother of an old friend of hers lived in Clark’s Mews at the time and she remembered having seen Jimi in the Mews on the 17th of September. She remembered this because she asked Harvey to move the big American car (a Ford Mustang that she mistook for a “huge Cadillac” that she thought belonged to Jimi) which was blocking her exit. When Harvey emerged to move his Mustang, she saw Jimi drive off with a friend (Monika of course, driving her blue Opel GT Coupé). The woman (Eliza – surname unknown) said that this was at the moment that she was leaving to see a movie (“Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid”, showing on Oxford Street at the time), which would mean that this would have been early evening and not at 10:40 pm).\n\nInteresting to note that Monika’s possessive behaviour was more like that of someone who had been in a relationship for months or years. She had only been with Jimi for 2 days! Jimi must have been wondering what sort of mess he had gotten himself into.\n\nGerry Stickells said that he spoke on the phone to Jimi that evening and found him in “…a great mood…he was to sign the contracts for his German tour in October the next day. We were also talking about doing four dates in the States around Thanksgiving. He said ‘OK, we’ll talk more about that tomorrow when you bring the contracts.” (6)\n\nScotch of St. James?\n\nI read somewhere (source needed) that Eric Clapton said he saw Jimi in a bar that evening but didn’t join him. Eric also told a BBC reporter that he’d seen him in another box at The Lyceum but as far as we know, Jimi didn’t go to the Lyceum that evening (or did he briefly pop in and out? Jim Capaldi of Traffic also said that he saw Jimi there).\n\nPerhaps Eric was confusing the sighting with a visit to the Scotch Of St. James because in June 2011, musician Meic Stevens stated that he was with Jimi at the Scotch and that Clapton was there too! Stevens recounted that Jimi was intrigued by what he was drinking, which was Louis St George Burgundy. Stevens added: “[Hendrix] was drinking lager or some kind of beer and he just poured the wine into the pint glass.” So if this is true, it’s another sign of Jimi’s reckless behaviour.\n\nSleeping pills at The Samarkand\n\nSleeping pills and amphetamine – a deadly mix\n\nDuring the couple of weeks leading up to the accident at the Samarkand Hotel basement apartment, we have numerous accounts mentioning Jimi’s habit of taking sleeping pills/downers in an irresponsible way. When his girlfriend of the moment Kirsten Nefer met up with him before the disastrous Aarhus performance, she found him at the hotel “…staggering, he was really out of it… Jimi talked and talked but it was all gibberish…. Jimi kept acting weird. He told me that he had taken some sleeping tablets that had made him confused and that he hadn’t slept for days.”\n\nAt the hotel after the Aarhus performance, after collapsing then asking for cocaine backstage, Jimi again took sleeping pills at the hotel but didn’t attempt to sleep, telling Kirsten that they had to talk all night – “We talked until about seven in the morning. By that time the effect of the sleeping pills were beginning to wear off.” (6)\n\nA few days later (around September 14th), Jimi took a taxi with Devon Wilson to Roger Daltrey and Heather Taylor house in the Berkshire countryside. Daltrey was out on tour with The Who in Europe but Heather’s friend Catherine James was present and she recounts in her book “Dandelion: Memoir Of A Free Spirit” that they all took LSD: “Jimi could barely stand and repeatedly asked ‘Do you have any Mandrax or some Valium?’ I had already given Jimi two Mandrax, but he had already forgotten he’d even taken them…. he finally passed out cold on the floor.”\n\nCatherine goes on to say: “We’d seen Jimi pretty high in the past, but never like this…. Heather sighed ‘Oh God, what if he ODs here? Roger will kill me.”. (6)\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Romesh Ranganathan (for the latter’s light-hearted television “mis-investigation”) Roger Daltrey talks of how it was a thing, a trend back then to take downers like Mandrax or sleeping pills and that if you got past the sleep inducing effect, you would get a certain “high”. This was perhaps what Jimi was indulging in, along with the LSD, the cocaine, the weed,…but really, what exacerbated his condition was the fact that he was taking amphetamines and barbiturates – uppers and downers… on a day-to-day basis. A recipe for disaster.\n\nIn his autobiography “Lonely Boy” (Windmill Books 2016), Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols talks about spending hours and hours learning the guitar and how much amphetamines helped him with that task: “Some people call them black bombers, others call them black beauties, but either way, you’d better get plenty of Mandrax to take afterwards if you ever want to get to fucking sleep.” Exactly the path Jimi took on September 18th, which would lead to his death.\n\nThe final return to the Samarkand\n\nSo the detailed events above reveal that after flitting haphazardly around London Jimi and Monika returned to The Samarkand Hotel at around between 4 and 5 a.m. on the morning of the 18th.\n\nThe furious arguing between Monika and Jimi wasn’t over apparently. Monika told P.C. Ian Smith (when he took a statement from her on the afternoon of the 18th) that upon their return to the Samarkand flat they had an argument yet again!\n\nP.C. Ian Smith: “She said they had an argument and he’d stormed off to cool down. When he came back, he took some sleeping tablets and went to bed. Then she went out, and when she came back, he’d been sick and she couldn’t wake him” (4)\n\nSo, following the time when Jimi left Pete Kameron’s flat, the visit to meet Alvenia Bridges, the drinks in Soho, the return to The Samarkand (at around 4 or 5 a.m.?) and the further row with Jimi going out to cool off,… a lot of time passed. This would mean that Jimi might have taken the first sleeping pill(s) between 5 and 6 a.m. or even later, all of which in fact lines up with what Monika recounted about that morning.\n\nThe number of pills and when they were taken – a complete mystery\n\nSo much for Monika’s account that they’d had a tranquil night at the flat. Also, personally attacking and screaming at Jimi was hardly the behaviour of someone assigned to get Jimi to The Samarkand Hotel so that he would fall prey to hit-men (as the conspiracy fantasist will claim).\n\nWhat actually happened on their return to the Samarkand is shrouded in mystery and not helped by the multitude of varying accounts from Monika:\n\n1 – Jimi had tried the tablets BEFORE Sept 18th:\n\nGuitarist (September 1995) – “That morning I secretly took a sleeping pill which is something I would never normally do”. Oh really Monika? The pills were prescribed to you!\n\nIn the same article: “I had hidden them in a cupboard but Jimi had already taken one a few days earlier when he couldn’t sleep so he knew the sleeping tablet’s effect. I secretly took one because if he knew I’d taken one he’d immediately take one too”.\n\nIn Electric Gypsy: “…these tablets were not very strong. He had tried them out before and he couldn’t sleep with them.”\n\nIn her own book: “A few days earlier he had taken one of my tablets and it had taken him an hour to fall asleep.”\n\n2 – Jimi took the pills without her knowing\n\nIn The Final Days (P. 152), she tells Sharon Lawrence that she didn’t give Jimi the pills: “…he must have found them in the cupboard”\n\nIn the Daily Sketch, ten days after Jimi’s death, Monika recounted: “I took a sleeping tablet about 7 a.m….I wanted some cigarettes but as Jimi did not like me going out without me telling him, I looked to see if he was awake. He was sleeping normally. Just before I was about to go out, I looked at him again and there was sick on his nose and mouth. He was breathing and his pulse was beating. I checked it with mine and there was no difference. Then I tried to wake him up – but I could not. I then saw that he had taken some of my sleeping tablets…. They are in packets of ten and I thought he had taken the lot but a police officer found one on the floor. He must have taken them shortly after I started to go to sleep.”\n\n3 – Jimi took tablets on the 18th and she was aware of it at the time\n\nIn one account, she said on their return to the flat Jimi suggested taking sleeping pills but she insisted that he should wait a while.\n\nThe Final Days (p 128) – “…he was wide awake and he was then saying he needed to have sleep, so he was thinking of taking sleeping pills…”\n\nThe Final Days (P. 156) – She told P. Weyell of the Coroner’s Office that at 7 a.m. “He took some tablets and went to bed”.\n\n“I was trying to work out why Jimi Had swallowed so many sleeping tablets. The only answer I could find was that after I had fallen asleep he had taken the two tablets he had planned to take earlier.” (1)\n\n– A very revealing quote comes from Monika’s brother Herbert. She phoned him right after the tragic incident and told him that Jimi had taken a handful of pills because “…he wanted to sleep for a day and a half.”\n\n4 – Monika gave Jimi the tablets:\n\n– Six days after Jimi’s death on September 24, an interview with Monika appeared in the German magazine Bild. In the interview Monika said:\n\n“He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets.”\n\n– In Kathy’s book, Monika told Kathy, Mitch and Noel that the pills “were very weak” and that it was she who gave Jimi “some” of her Vesparax tablets and when they seemed to have no effect, she gave him “some more”!!!\n\n5 – Monika also took a pill:\n\n– The Daily Sketch, ten days after Jimi’s death: “I took a sleeping tablet about 7 a.m…”\n\n– At the inquest: “I took a tablet at about 7 a.m.”\n\n– In her own book: “I secretly took one sleeping tablet”\n\n– Electric Gypsy “Monika says that she took a sleeping pill but never saw Jimi take any himself.”\n\n– The Final Days (p 128) – “… I think it was six o’clock or a bit later before I took mine.”\n\nSomewhere within all of Monika’s different accounts lies the truth.\n\nJimi called his doctor in New York\n\nThere is yet another account, this time from Jimi’s friend Buzzy Linhart (who had played vibraphone on “Drifting”). He was in New York when he heard of Jimi’s death. He went to Electric Lady Studios to find out more and received a phone call:\n\n“I picked up the telephone on the receptionist’s desk and it was Dolly Dagger (Devon Wilson) telling me I had to believe her. What she told me was that Jimi had called her the day or so before and told her that he had been up for days. He had talked to his doctor in New York City and the doctor said “You’ve got to get some sleep” – the doctor said “Do you want me to call in some sleeping pills for you to a doctor I know in London?” Jimi said” No, that’s OK, there’s Tuinals in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom here.” They agreed that Jimi- having a great tolerance to this type of drug -would need to take 3 capsules. But this turned out to be the German Tuinals which were the EQUIVALENT of three a piece, so they turned out to have the potency of 9 of his usual Tuinal capsules.” (from Inside The Legacy Of Jimi Hendrix by Joe Viglione and Buzzy Linhart)\n\nIf we are to take Linhart’s/Devon’s account as being factual, Jimi’s U.S. doctor (no idea who that was) gave Jimi the go-ahead to take 3 tablets. The doctor perhaps had only Jimi’s word that the pills were Tuinals. Jimi in fact had Monika’s super strong German prescription Vesparax pills in his hand but perhaps recognised their listed contents and simply called them “Tuinals” (which was the brand name he was familiar with). Vesparax was in fact a combination of secobarbital/brallobarbital/hydroxyzine and Tuinals were composed of only secobarbital) – hence his erroneous assumption about the pills’ potency.\n\nLinhart’s account sounds factual. If he’d wanted to add some spice or extra credibility to his book, he could have said that Jimi phoned him directly, excited about recording together or any old thing.\n\nIn a letter to Harry Shapiro (dated Feb. 28 1992) Dr. Rufus Crompton writes: “Vesparax is indeed as strong as a 200 mg barbiturate capsule. Hendrix may not have realised this. [He] may have realised that he was too high on amphetamine and looked for a barbiturate to bring him down. Not being familiar with Vesparax, he could have taken too much, seriously inhibiting his normal cough reflex, so that when he drank some wine, it went down the wrong way and was not coughed up.”\n\nCrompton was referring to the alcohol that Jimi had been drinking all night at the various locations and obviously not Dr. Bannister’s erroneous account of lungs and stomach full of wine. After that, Dr. Crompton was consulted in the 1994 reinvestigation (triggered by Kathy Etchingham to help Noel) and was presented with all the medical evidence. He stated to the police that Dr. Bannister’s account made no sense (document further down).\n\nThis pill-popping of uppers and downers, after having drunk alcohol all night, is a further illustration of Jimi’s recklessness.\n\nThe normal dose for these German pills was a half to 1 tablet. It is of course known that Jimi had a very high tolerance for drugs. Many people have remarked how Jimi was able to take double or triple doses of various drugs and hardly seem to show any difference in his demeanour. So if Jimi popped 3 Vesparax pills, he might have simply gone off to sleep like a baby. That would leave only 7 pills in the 10-pill blister on the fateful morning of the 18th!\n\nSo if on the 18th Monika took her 1 pill (as she told the police, the inquest and the press on many occasions) and the police found 1 pill near the bed, then that would leave only 5 pills for Jimi to take on the morning of the 18th!! Scoop! Tony Brown pointed out in The Final Days (page 128-129) that it seems unlikely that Monika took a tablet, seeing as the recommended dose of half a tablet induces a good night’s sleep. However Monika says in his book that she did sleep for three hours but awoke and had tried to fall asleep again but couldn’t. She even says that she got up and had breakfast. She has also said that she went out to buy cigarettes (she told Kathy Etchingham that she drove down Queensway to buy them!).\n\nAlso, for all we know, Monika might have been taking 1 of her sleeping pills every night for the past few days! After all, they were prescribed to her! She said in her book (The Inner World Of Jimi Hendrix) “…I did have about forty five prescribed sleeping tablets, in packs of ten, in a large cupboard opposite the bed, they were left over from two operations I had recently undergone in Germany.”\n\nSo this means there could well have been only 3 or 4 tablets in the blister by the 18th! Jimi may have taken only 3 tablets again (as he seems to have taken a couple of days earlier) and got into difficulty because of the added intoxication from the “black bomber” barbiturate taken at Kameron’s party, his alcohol and drug intake and perhaps because of his apparent viral infection and his condition of sleep apnea (see paragraph near end of page).\n\nDr. Rufus Crompton and the number of pills…and “there is no villain”\n\nDuring the 1993 reinvestigation (triggered by the Mitchell/Etchingham research) pathologist Rufus Crompton was asked by detectives to examine the medical evidence. Here is what he told the BBC:\n\n“We are going, to a large extent, on evidence from people which cannot be corroborated one way or the other. For instance, what he ate, what went on the previous evening, whether he went to bed a happy man or not, how many of these pills he took, when he took them,… these are all quite important facts in which we just have to believe what we’re told…My personal opinion is that there is no villain.”(8)\n\nSo after reviewing all the evidence, the Post Mortem Reports, Dr. Crompton found nothing suspicious about Jimi’s death at all.\n\nKathy informs us that Dr. Crompton said that the barbiturate reading in Jimi’s liver was so high that he couldn’t have survived (Dr. Michael D. Hunter later came to the same conclusion). Still, this doesn’t give clear indication of the actual amount of Vesparax pills taken at the Samarkand but Kathy said of Crompton’s analysis:\n\n“…when another pathologist looked into this in 1994, his conclusion was that there was no evidence that he had taken 9 tablets, because the toxicology levels could have been as few as five, to have had those levels. The only person that said he took 9 was the girl herself, Monika Dannemann. There was no evidence that he’d taken 9, he could have taken 5. It would have had the same devastating effect.“\n\nSo folks, you can forget the whole “9 pills” nonsense.\n\nDid Monika deliberately drug Jimi to keep him at the Samarkand?\n\nWas it an innocent mistake?\n\nOn the afternoon of the day Jimi died, Monika told Sharon Lawrence that Jimi had taken her prescription tablets. Sharon asked if Monika had given the tablets to Jimi and she said “No, he must have found them in the bathroom cupboard”. Monika told Sharon that she thought Jimi had taken “about nine” and that the pills were “very weak”! Days later she told Bild magazine that she had given Jimi the pills!\n\nAs stated above, Monika told Kathy Etchingham, Mitch and Noel that the pills “were very weak” and again that it was she who gave Jimi “some” of her Vesparax tablets and when they seemed to have no effect, she gave him “some more”! Also, talking about the events of September 18th his book, Noel Redding (who met Monika in the 90s) says of her: “At about 6 a.m., she says that he complained that there was something wrong and wondered whether someone had slipped him an OD.” This could of course had been another attempt by Monika of deflecting the blame from herself.\n\nSo why had Monika been recounting that Jimi had taken 9 pills without her knowing? This seems to indicate that she was trying to cover her tracks because of the profound guilt that she had let Jimi take her own powerful prescription tablets and this had led to his death. An even worse possibility: in his book “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”, Eric Burdon suggested that after the evening’s arguing, Monika spiked the tuna fish sandwich with Vesparax, not to kill him but in the hope that she could delay his departure from the flat. Kathy Etchingham also supported this theory (as seen in another recent ReelzTV documentary and in the documentary “Hendrix And The Spook”).\n\nAfter their very public argument outside Phillip Harvey’s flat and the nagging at Pete Kameron’s flat and the further argument at the Samarkand, did Monika fear that Jimi would leave her for good? Did her possessive jealousy lead her to deliberately try to knock Jimi out in order to keep him at the flat? Or, did she innocently under-estimate the strength of those tablets? Monika could quite possibly have witnessed Jimi’s high drug tolerance during their time together (back in 1969 and September 1970), and this could have led her to accept the dosage that Jimi took (either alone or given by her).\n\nIf it was a simple error or a miscalculation of a dose to keep Jimi with her, then that would explain Monika’s total panic and her muddled stories, as she tried to cover up the terrible guilt and fear that she was responsible for the death of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nDannemann – the calculated killer?\n\nThe conspiracy theorist believes that Monika was some sort of cool, calculated agent working in league with Jeffery/MI5/COINTELPRO in the plot to assassinate Jimi Hendrix! I kid you not. This is disproved by the accounts of Alvenia Bridges and Eric Burdon. Monika had in fact been in an utter state of panic about Jimi’s situation as she desperately tried to find out if Jimi had a doctor in London. Monika had lied, saying that everything was hunky dory with Jimi that night but those at Harvey’s and Kameron’s flats witnessed a volatile and aggressive Monika, publicly insulting him. Also, when the police visited The Samarkand Hotel in the afternoon of September 18th, they found out that the violent arguing had continued in the flat when the couple had returned after their evening at Kameron’s and in Soho (Jimi had even walked out of the flat to cool off at one point).\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Alvenia Bridges states that when Monika phoned her on that September 18th morning in 1970, “…she was hysterical…hysterical”.\n\nMonika completely broke down after Jimi’s death and I found the proof after an interview I did with ex-Animals guitarist Vic Briggs, which led me to being contacted by his wife Elandra Meredith. On September 18th, Elandra had been summoned (either to the Samarkand or Eric Burdon’s hotel room) to help the hysterically out of control Dannemann:\n\n“The experience that most shook me to the core was finding myself in the house of Jimi Hendrix (sic) right after he died. His distraught girlfriend, Monika Danneman, was pacing back and forth and round and round chain-smoking. The room was thick with smoke and fear and horror.” – “Monika was out of her mind with shock, distraught to the point of madness, pacing like crazy, smoking non stop with trembling hands. She seemed incapable of relating to anything.” – “She was ranting, not sure what said, or what I said, I have the feeling I could not get her attention to even try to calm down”\n\n> My full interview with Elandra Meredith\n\nFinally, if Monika was on a mission to make sure Jimi was at the Samarkand in the early hours of the 18th, for the “hit” (cue laughter) then why had she been nagging, aggressing and arguing with him all evening and all night (as witnessed by many and confirmed by the police)? Hardly the behaviour of a calculated agent for Mike Jeffery as the conspiracy theorist likes to imagine. Jimi could have fled her at any moment.\n\nAlso, if she was a conspirator, why would she create all the fuss phoning around and alerting Judy Wong, Alvenia and Eric, with all the “flat full of drugs” panic? All a conspirator would have to do is sit tight then phone for an ambulance.\n\nIt gets worse. The conspiracy theorist also believes that Alvenia, Burdon, Wong, Stickells, Barrett and Slater were also part of the conspiracy! So were the hospital staff!!So was Scotland Yard!!! So were MI6, the CIA and the Freemasons!!! Seriously nuts.\n\nThe ambulance arrives\n\nAfter calling the ambulance Monika recounted: “The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later. He was still breathing. I was checking his pulse all the time.”\n\nThe ambulance reached the Samarkand Hotel at 11:27 AM.\n\nIn 1991, the two ambulance attendants Reg Jones and John Suau were interviewed by Dee Mitchell and Kathy Etchingham. The accounts were first published in September 1992 in an article by Michael Fairchild in Steve Roby’s Hendrix fanzine Straight Ahead. They were reproduced in two books by Tony Brown (“A Visual Documentary – Omnibus Press 1992 and “The Final Hours” – Rogan House 1997) and brief extracts appeared in Kathy’s own book (“Through Gypsy Eyes” – Victor Gallancz 1998).\n\nThe ambulancemen said that they had the impression that Jimi was already dead at the hotel apartment (ambulance staff are not qualified to determine death). They also said that Dannemann wasn’t at the flat when they arrived (although one of them said, around the same time, that she in fact was!).\n\nFor the record, the following are the accounts that ended up in all the books (via Michael Fairchild’s original Straight Ahead magazine articles), as recounted to Dee and Kathy (and later disowned by ambulanceman John Suau! – see further down).\n\nIt must be pointed out that the ambulancemen interviews presented here were set up by Dee Mitchell, who Kathy Etchingham would soon expose as a libellous, stalking fraud (see her book “Gypsy Eyes”).\n\nJones (ambulance driver): “It was horrific, we arrived at the flat, the door was flung open, nobody about, just the body on the bed. We called out for someone, loads of times, so we walked in. We went into the bedroom, it was dark because the curtains were still pulled, I mean the gas fire was on but you couldn’t see anything, your eyes had to adjust. He was covered in vomit, there was tons of it all over the pillow, black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down, his tongue had fallen back, he was flat on his back you see. The room was dark, we had to pull the curtains. Well we had to get the police, we only had him and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, got the aspirator too. We felt his pulse between his shoulders, pinched his earlobe and nose, showed a light in his eyes, but there was no response at all. I knew he was dead as soon as I walked in the room, you get a feel for it, I can’t explain it, but you do and I knew he was dead. Once the police arrived which seemed like no time at all, we got him off to the hospital as quick as we could. See we just have to keep working on him and we did, my shirt was wringing wet. ‘Cos the ambulances in them days, weren’t equipped like they are now, we had them crazy Wadhams [type of ambulance] in them days, awful they was. We took him to St. Mary Abbots. That don’t have a casualty ward now but in them days it did. That was our designated hospital for the day. There was a ‘bed state’ at St. Charles, you found out at the beginning of your shift what your designated hospital was.”\n\nJones again from Kathy Etchingham’s book: “When we got to the flat, the door was wide open. The body was on the bed, covered in vomit of all colours, black, brown, all over him, all over the pillow. There wasn’t another soul in sight. I went back to the ambulance for an aspirator. We tried to revive him but we couldn’t. The vomit was all dried. He’d been lying there for a long time. There was no heartbeat. He was blue, not breathing and not responding to light or pain. We called the police from the radio in the ambulance. thinking he was dead and that the circumstances were strange. A couple of young policemen turned up and they told us to take him to the hospital.”\n\nReg Jones told Kathy and Dee that the police officers at the Samarkand didn’t call the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) in order to declare the apartment a crime scene, because they couldn’t be bothered with all the paperwork! To them, the body was, to quote Kathy: “…just another dead junkie in Notting Hill”.\n\nSo from this account, it appeared to Jones that Jimi had already passed away. HOWEVER, Jones is also quoted as saying “If there had been no pulse, then I would have attempted resuscitation… I didn’t on this patient, so there was obviously no need to do so” (1). This would mean that Jimi did have a pulse and was still alive!! Which is it Reg?\n\nAlso, Jones also told Mitchell/Etchingham that they drove to the hospital with “full lights and sirens” which obviously means that they were transporting someone in urgent need of medical attention – not an irrecuperable long-dead body. Boom goes the murder theory once again. P.C. Ian Smith said he had no memory of the siren being on as it left the hotel but it could have been put on afterwards of course to clear traffic ahead – as Monika said in her book “The driver used the siren only once, when we encountered heavy traffic.”\n\nJohn Suau (ambulance attendant): Suau had filled in because Jones’s regular partner was off that week. Afterwards, the two men apparently never saw each other again. The following is Suau’s version of events:\n\n“Well I remember we had a hell of a time trying to suck him out (with an aspirator). I mean the vomit was dry, and there was a hell of a lot of it. The aspirators in those days were all right but not like you have today, they couldn’t shift that lot. I mean we knew it was hopeless, nothing would have worked. To tell the truth, I thought it was an overdose. It wasn’t really my business to diagnose, I just had to keep working. There were no bed clothes on top of him. An ambulance crew by law just has to keep on working on him until we get him to the hospital. There was no pulse, no respiration. We got down to the flat, and there was nobody but the body on the bed. So we had to radio for the police from the ambulance. We couldn’t touch anything in the flat. As I say, we knew he was gone, he was on top of the bed dressed, but I didn’t recognize him, don’t know anybody would have recognized him, his mother wouldn’t have recognized him. He was in a pool of vomit, it was everywhere, but we are not doctors, it’s our job to keep trying till we get him to the hospital, we can’t proclaim him dead…I vaguely remember taking a sample of the vomit in a container, because we didn’t know what he had taken. So as soon as the police arrived, we were off. I was in the back with Jimi, Reg drove. When we moved him, the gases were gurgling, you get when someone has died, it wasn’t too pleasant. The vomit was all the way down, we couldn’t have got an airway down. He was flat on his back, it’s a shame he wasn’t on his side because he probably would have pulled through.”\n\nThere is something which throws doubt on these quotes (which are from the Mitchell/Etchingham dossier). They mention masses of vomit (brown and black) all over Jimi and the bed. Where did that great quantity of regurgitated food come from? We know that Jimi only nibbled a few mouthfuls of Chinese food right before he left the gathering at Pete Kameron’s flat and that a half-digested meal (with traces of rice) was still in his stomach at death (Post-Mortem Report). So with so little food consumed during the evening/night and with some of it still in his gut and lungs at the hospital, the notion that Jimi vomited profusely all over the place appears ludicrous (unless he’d had another meal after the party – which doesn’t seem to be the case apart from one bite of a tuna fish sandwich according to Monika).\n\nSuau would later refute the above accounts!\n\nHendrix researcher and ex. Police Superintendent Dennis Care interviewed Suau during his 1993 investigation into the circumstances of Jimi’s death. His report was submitted to Al Hendrix and to Monika Dannemann. His 50 page report remains unpublished but extracts appear in Caesar Glebbeek’s Univibes special “Until We Meet Again”):\n\n“He was on the bed, lying on his back; there was vomit around his mouth, on his chest and some on the pillow cases – not masses of it but more than enough to see what had happened… The patient was still alive, just, but he was pretty far gone… The bladder and bowels had not voided then and neither did they in the ambulance on the journey to the hospital… There was no mess in the ambulance caused by our patient…”\n\nDennis Care showed John Suau what had been published about his presence on the scene at The Samarkand. Here is what Suau had to say about what has been printed and reprinted in the various books:\n\n“I was… shown [on 7 July 1993 by Dennis Care] a copy of what I was alleged to have said when I was interviewed about this matter by two women [Dee and Kathy]… The vast majority of that document* is untrue and does not reflect what I said at that [telephone] interview.”\n\n* The Mitchell/Etchingham files, published in Straight Ahead #43, October 1992; Voodoo Child #27, Summer 1992; Jimi Hendrix: A Visual Documentary by Tony Brown, p. 125; and Hendrix: The Final Days by Tony Brown, p. 137]\n\nIn 1995, Suau was interviewed for the BBC Radio One’s “Wink Of An Eye” broadcast and he said: “There’s a standard procedure especially for someone who’s unconscious. They travel on their side. All the equipment is there at his head if you need to do resuscitation, anything like that, it’s all there ready to use.” This proves that Jimi was still being considered as someone in distress at that point and was certainly not a long-dead corpse (with all the signs of rigor mortis and lividity that that would imply).\n\nSuau also said that Monika did not travel with them to the hospital. “There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else.”\n\n“The casualty” – “Unconscious” – Again, proof that Jimi wasn’t considered to be long-dead. Ambulances never transport dead bodies (unless they die in the ambulance – which as we know was the case with Jimi).\n\nNote that Suau’s and Jones’s accounts make no mention of wine at all (which would have been all over the place if Jimi had been water-boarded). They spoke only of dry vomit which had blocked up Jimi’s airways. If he had been water-boarded with great quantities of wine filling his stomach and lungs then any food/vomit would simply have been flushed/regurgitated out and not left his throat clogged with dry vomit. Again, this shows clearly that the ridiculous “drowned in wine” is well and truly ruled out, even if one believes what Dee and Kathy put together.\n\nALSO – P.C. John Shaw visited the flat later, on the afternoon of the 18th and he stated at the inquest that there was nothing unusual in the flat and that everything was “smart and clean” – which it certainly wouldn’t have been if Jimi had been in a “pool of vomit” or had been waterboarded with wine!\n\nShaw even took the bed sheets away for analysis, which tells us that they must have been stained with vomit (so the “clean-up” crew hadn’t changed the sheets evidently). There is also a quote from a housekeeper at the Samarkand by the name of Lydia Ranvaud: “Two pillow cases were thrown away on the instructions of Mr. Dan Hall but there was really no need to have done this, they merely required washing out…”(1)\n\nSuau also stated that in order to get Jimi up the steps to the street, they used a “Rumbold stretcher” (meaning a type of wheelchair that permets handlers to carry people where a normal stretcher won’t manoeuvre). Again, if Jimi had been long-dead, rigor mortis would have made it impossible to seat him in the chair! So Jimi was obviously still supple.\n\nNote that Monika said that the ambulancemen told her that Jimi would be walking out of the hospital that afternoon (but then Monika said a lot of things).\n\nSo it is evident that the paramedics found Jimi unconscious, in a coma and not dead.\n\nP.C. Ian Smith’s unreliable accounts\n\nOn the morning of the 18th, P.C. Ian Smith had arrived on the scene just as Jimi was being carried out. According to Smith: “The ambulancemen were there, but Jimi was dead … There was really nothing they could do for him.” Smith disputed Dannemann’s claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: “No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi … there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come… But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed… us in. It wasn’t until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix.” However, in a 1990 interview with the Bucks Advertiser, Smith remembers being greeted by Monika at The Samarkand!\n\nIn “The Final Days”, Tony Brown shows that P.C. Ian Smith gave two differing accounts. In one he implies that he went into the flat and saw Jimi on the bed but in a later statement he said “I didn’t see him. I was there as they were carrying him out” ! Hell, if you can’t rely on a police officer to give a clear account, who can you believe?\n\nIn 1993, Dennis Care showed Ian Smith what is in Tony Brown’s books (published in Straight Ahead #43, October 1992; Jimi Hendrix: A Visual Documentary by Tony Brown, p. 125; Hendrix: The Final Days by Tony Brown, p. 139) purported to have been made by him. When shown the statement, Ian Smith immediately disowned it! So nothing that P.C. Smith has said can be taken seriously.\n\nWhat a ridiculous labyrinth of conflicting accounts this case is!\n\nA passer-by sees Jimi alive in the ambulance! – Scoop!\n\nAmerican citizen Michael Glass (born 1939) was living next door to The Samarkand Hotel at the time. He was married to a British woman and was in London working as a researcher for Rolling Stone Magazine, while also taking classes at the Royal College of Art. On Facebook, he revealed that he saw Jimi in the ambulance outside the hotel before it left and he confirms that Jimi was still alive.\n\n“I was there in London when Jimi died. I lived next door to where he was staying. I had just come from the market and was walking by and heard him struggling with strangling. I looked into the ambulance and saw Jimi. It was a major drag.”\n\nSo I contacted Mr. Glass in order to get more details. September 18th 1970 was 54 years ago, so fine details are understandably difficult to remember. Michael didn’t see much but what he did see is vital.\n\nMichael: I was there in London when Jimi died. I was living in Landsdown Crescent in an area called Notting Hill Gate. I lived next door to where he was staying. We were renting a room in this 13-room apartment building.\n\nJHRG: Had you seen Jimi around the hotel before that morning?\n\nMichael: No. I only knew he was living next door. Somebody mentioned it to me.\n\nJHRG: So tell me about that morning.\n\nMichael: I just happened to be walking by. I was coming home from work. I had been to the only supermarket in that area at that time, which was a Safeway and I had two bags of groceries, one in each hand. There was this Indian hotel next door to the apartment house I was living in. As I walked by, I could hear somebody in the back of the ambulance choking, gasping for breath. The back door of the ambulance was open.\n\nJHRG: Had you seen him being lifted into the ambulance?\n\nMichael: No, he was in the ambulance as I was walking by.\n\nJHRG: Were there other people looking in, or just you?\n\nMichael: No, there was nobody else around. Nobody. There were two guys working on him and I looked in and it was Jimi.\n\nJHRG: So you recognised him right away?\n\nMichael: Yeah. I thought well, he was black and I knew he was living next door.\n\nJHRG: Do you remember if his eyes were open?\n\nMichael: No, I didn’t see his face. He was on a gurney. I saw him from the feet on.\n\nJHRG: So he was lying down.\n\nMichael: Yeah.\n\nJHRG: You saw the two men working on Jimi but can you remember a police officer being at the scene too?\n\nMichael: I think there was a policeman arriving as I was leaving.\n\nJHRG: After this, did you see the ambulancemen close the doors and drive away? Did you hear a siren?\n\nMichael: No, I just left. I was living in the next building. I just continued on and went home. I told my wife what I’d seen and that was about it and that day I actually found out that it was Jimi and that he’d died.\n\nSo this crucial eye-witness account confirms what the hospital reported, what was stated at the inquest and what ambulanceman John Suau recounted to private investigator Dennis Care – Jimi was still alive when he was in the ambulance.\n\nMichael also confirms that Jimi wasn’t sitting up in the ambulance as Monika claimed (though a collapsible chair had been used to get Jimi up the steep steps to street level). Monika is nowhere to be seen in Michael’s account, so it seems unlikely that she travelled to the hospital in the ambulance. However Michael didn’t see the doors close or the ambulance leave so she could of course have been gathering her affairs and Jimi’s identity papers in the flat at that particular moment.\n\nDid Monika travel in the ambulance or follow in her car?\n\nWhen interviewed by Dee Mitchell and Kathy Etchingham in the early 90s, it seemed that the ambulancemen had no recollection that Monika was at The Samarkand when they arrived, or that she had travelled with them to the hospital. So it has been assumed that Monika was lying. However, on September 19th 1970, the day after Jimi’s death, David Tune of The Daily Mirror reported “Twenty-three-year-old Monica Dannemann called an ambulance and sat weeping beside him as he was driven to hospital.”. So it’s not as if Monika invented this after the tragedy.\n\nJohn Suau told Dennis Care that what is in the books (Kathy Etchingham, Tony Brown etc.) is untrue and that Monika was at The Samarkand when they arrived and that she either travelled with them to the hospital or followed the ambulance (because he remembered a woman being there at the Admissions desk): “I also remember vaguely a woman at the Admissions Desk; she could only have known where we were taking the patient if she’d come with us or followed us.”\n\nAlso, when Dee Mitchell switched to researching to help Monika (instead of Kathy), she again contacted Suau. In a letter to Monika in 1995 she said: “…the problem is, he said different things all three times… The very first time I spoke to him [during the research with Kathy], he said no one else was in the flat but ‘the little girl’. And when I asked ‘who if anyone, had come in the ambulance with Jimi’, he said ‘I think the little girl did, the little blond girl, yes, she rode in the back of the ambulance.’ ” Was this an invention by Dee as she tried to work her way into Monika’s confidence (as she had previously done with Kathy?).\n\nOver the years, she has been quoted saying that she was in the ambulance or that she “drove with them” (implying in her car) and this seems to be confirmed by Dr. Robert Brown who was the first doctor to attend to Jimi on arrival (Brown later became the national leader of the Australian Greens from 1996 – 2012). In his autobiography “Optimism”, Brown stated that he remembered seeing a “tall blond girl following the trolley carrying Jimi as it was wheeled in from the ambulance.” Also, in an interview on ABC Radio Hobart (Australia/North Tasmania), Brown said that when he saw Jimi being wheeled in on a stretcher: “His girlfriend was trotting up the hill behind him in her high-heels I remember and looking helpless”. Monika wasn’t tall but perhaps her high heels and long blond hair gave her a sleek look.\n\nSo obviously Monika either travelled in the ambulance or followed directly behind in her car. In her book, Monika says “From the hospital, Gerry Stickles, Eric Barrett and Alvenia Bridges took me back to the flat.” Which would obviously mean that she hadn’t followed the ambulance to the hospital in her car (or one of the guys drove her there in her car).\n\nWas Jimi sat up in the ambulance?\n\nAmbulanceman Reg Jones said that to get Jimi up the narrow exterior stairway from the basement flat, “…we put him in a ‘Rumbold’ stretcher – that’s a fold-up chair-like thing with wheels and legs… then we carried him up the steps, into the ambulance and onto the stretcher bed”. Jones was referring to the type of collapsible chairs that ambulance staff use for safely carrying patients up and down stairways. So Monika must have seen Jimi sitting in that chair as he entered the ambulance and assumed that that was how he was transported to the hospital.\n\nMonika would later say that the ambulancemen had sat Jimi up in the ambulance and that is why he choked to death (he should have been laid down with his head to one side).\n\nWhen Hendrix researcher Tony Brown quizzed ambulanceman John Suau about this he replied: “Sit him up? No, you don’t sit people up when they’ve choked. The steps up from the flat were steep, and you had a natural incline on the way up, but no, he wasn’t sat up.” Also, in a BBC Radio One interview (aired September 10, 1995), Suau explained how a person is normally transported in an ambulance: “There’s a standard procedure especially for someone who’s unconscious. They travel on their side. All the equipment is there at his head if you need to do resuscitation, anything like that, it’s all there ready for use.”\n\nSo the suggestion that Jimi was at up in the ambulance has been judged as a fantasy by Monika in an attempt to shift the blame from herself to the ambulance officer. X-Ray engineer (Mr. Waspe) who was on duty at St. Mary Abbot’s that morning told his son David Waspe that at the time, there was a rumour going around the hospital that the ambulancemen had indeed made the fatal error of sitting Jimi up. However, passer-by Michael Glass says that he saw Jimi inside the ambulance and he was lying down as the attendants worked on him.\n\nIs there another clue from an ambulanceman who had teamed up with either Suau or Jones some time later? Charles Todd: “I worked in Fulham as an ambulanceman and often paired with an ‘old timer’, who had transported Jimi to hospital. He was conveyed unconscious, in a chair, with his head unsupported and apparently died from asphyxiation consequent upon vomiting.” (14) However, Todd doesn’t say that his colleague actually said this and he might simply have read about it.\n\nAnother rumour (1):\n\nThis is only hearsay but drummer Winston Wedderburn recounted to musician Keith Bailey (Graham Bond Organisation, Ginger Baker’s Airforce,…) that when he worked as an ambulanceman in the 90s, his female driving partner had worked with Reginald Jones and John Suau in the past. She recounted that to Jones and Suau, Jimi was “just another black drunk” (or words to that effect) who they left on his back in the back of the ambulance.\n\nAmbulance crew covering their error?\n\nIF Jimi had been sat up in the ambulance, one could theorise that the ambulancemen were trying to cover themselves by recounting their stories about Jimi being already dead when they arrived at the Samarkand. These stories might have been concocted even back in 1970 when damaging rumours of their unprofessional conduct which had led to the death of an internationally famous pop star. The two men perhaps kept their stories in mind, right up to their interviews with Mitchell/Etchingham.\n\nIn January 1992, David Smith of the London Ambulance Service interviewed the two ambulancemen and concluded that on September 18, 1970, the two men had “acted in a proper and professional manner” and that nobody had travelled in the ambulance with them. In that case, Dannemann must have followed the ambulance in her car (because she was present at Casualty when Jimi was being wheeled in – witnessed by Dr. Brown).\n\nAll David Smith had to go on of course was what the two men told him. There was no third party or ambulance camera to confirm what the two men recounted! So did Suau and Jones make sure that their stories matched, to avoid any trouble.\n\nHOWEVER, there is more to all this than meets the eye.\n\nThe initial Dee Mitchell/Kathy Etchingham accounts published in various magazines and books have been taken as gospel but we have seen the contradictions in them and the rebuttal of those accounts by John Suau himself! Remembering a day’s work 20 years ago isn’t an exact science of course but was there another reason for the discrepancies in their accounts? Read on\n\nBannister also said the team (and not himself personally according to one of his statements) worked on the body for about half an hour but Dr.Seifert, who was in charge that morning, stated that they only worked on Jimi for a 10 minutes.\n\nIn the time frame of Bannister’s position at the hospital, any number of coloured patients would have been admitted for overdose emergencies. It’s not as if Jimi’s arrival at St. Mary Abbot’s was a unique occasion. Kathy Etchingham once said that the medical staff had treated Jimi like “yet another dead junkie coming into Casualty”. The hospital staff had no idea that this was a rock star in the Resuscitation Room. Bannister didn’t even know who Hendrix was in 1970!\n\nPints of wine held back…by vomit? – The laughable conspiracy theorist’s suggestion\n\nReginald Jones (ambulance driver): “His airway was completely blocked all the way down, his tongue had fallen back"
