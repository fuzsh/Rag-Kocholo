        "text": "We look back at the icon's last ever performance and what tracks he played.\n\nIt's now over half century since the world lost Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe legendary guitarist died on 18 September 1970, tragically becoming a member of the \"Forever 27\" club.\n\nHe was found in a basement apartment in London, having died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates.\n\nThe American guitarist, icon and rock pioneer had many brilliant moments in his short life, including his performance at Woodstock 1969, but what was his swan song?\n\nRadio X looks into the last gig the Purple Haze singer ever played, and just what featured on the setlist.\n\nWhere was Jimi Hendrix's last gig?\n\nSome may think Hendrix's last gig was at the Isle Of Wight Festival, which took place on the British island between 26th and 31st August 1970. However, the musician then went on to play the Open Air Love & Peace Festival in Fehmarn, Germany.\n\nInspired by the Isle Of Wight event, this show was set to take place on an Island set just North East of Hamburh and a few miles from the Danish coast from 4 to 6 September.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't quite the well-oiled machine it thought it would be, and the festival was fraught with problems due to poor organisation and ticket sales. On the Friday, the weather broke and the festival goers who braved the trip had to contend with wind and rain.\n\nOnly a portion of the tickets were sold, and many acts began pulling out of what was beginning to look like a disastrous inaugural event. But luckily Mr. Hendrix had already been paid in advance, so to the island he came...\n\nREAD MORE: What did The Stone Roses play at their last gig?\n\nAccording to a reporrt on the Concerts Wiki, Hendrix didn't play the first night he arrived due to poor weather conditions and an issue with tents being too close to his stage.\n\nJust before 1pm on the Sunday, Jimi finally took to the stage, playing what nobody realised would be his last ever public live performance.\n\nDisgruntled with the festival as a whole and his late showing at first, the crowd are believed to have jeered and booed, but Hendrix soon got them onside, kicking off his performance with a cover of Howling Wolf's Killing Floor.\n\nAfter playing his 1967 track, Spanish Castle Magic, Hendrix launched into his cover of Bob Dylan's All Along The Watchtower.\n\nOpting for his interpretation of Billy Roberts' Hey Joe for track number four, the rocker then played Hey Baby (New Rising Sun), Message of Love and the irresistible Foxy Lady, which was first taken from The Jimi Hendrix Experience's 1967 debut album Are You Experienced.\n\nRed House, Ezy Rider and Freedom were next up on the setlist, shortly followed by his later work, Room Full Of Mirrors.\n\nHendrix's 13-track-setlist ended with a duo of absolute belters, with the guitar legend playing a rendition of Purple Haze and Voodoo Chile (Slight Return), which would have no doubt swept the audience up into a frenzy.\n\nIt might not have been the glitziest of festivals, but thanks to a dodgy bootleg recording by the promoters on site, its memory has been preserved.\n\nOnce the bootleg had resurfaced, it was later mixed and produced into a live album in 2005, entitled Live at the Isle of Fehmarn, ready to be enjoyed by generations of fans born long after Hendrix passed away.\n\nJimi Hendrix's set at the Isle of Fehmarn festival in Germany on Sunday 6th September 1970\n\n1.
