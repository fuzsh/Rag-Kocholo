He was last seen in the hotel on Thursday afternoon cleaning his shoes in his suite.\n\nBut Jimi Hendrix, wrote his own epitaph: When I die, I want people to play my music, go wild, and freak out an' do anything they wanna do.\n\nTours: Jimi Hendrix's London\n\nTours: London 2012\n\nTours: The London Rockstar Death Trail\n\nThemes: Death Music\n\nJimi Hendrix Died Here\n\nThis is where Jimi Hendrix died of a drugs overdose.\n\nRanking This Month: 19/3067\n\nPages Hit This Month: 191\n\nYour Comments:\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nYour email will ONLY be used once, to confirm the publication of your comments.
