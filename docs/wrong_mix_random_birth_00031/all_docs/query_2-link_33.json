        "text": "Two prog rock masters return to record-store shelves and streaming services. August 2024's new music releases also include a celebrated moment from Woodstock and a rare solo album from one of the co-founders of the Rolling Stones.\n\nJon Anderson is releasing his first album of original songs with the Band of Geeks, a group of collaborators he found on YouTube. True follows a few years of touring together behind classic Yes songs. The LP was co-produced by Anderson and Band of Geeks bassist Richie Castellano, who's also in Blue Oyster Cult.\n\nIn a breakthrough moment, Alvin Lee and Ten Years After put on one of the best performances at Woodstock in 1969. Their complete set is now being released for the first time ever. Woodstock 1969 will arrive one day before the 55th anniversary of their appearance.\n\nA new new 10-disc vinyl set titled 8314 Boxed showcases Ian Anderson's solo career, including two sequels to Jethro Tull's prog classic Thick as a Brick. Both 2012's Thick as a Brick 2 and 2014's Homo Erraticus found Anderson once again returning to the fictional character Gerald Bostock.\n\nBill Wyman is set for a comeback. Drive My Car marks the Rolling Stones former bassist's first album in nine years â€“ and just his ninth ever. Wyman wrote or co-wrote five of the LP's 10 songs, rounding out the track listing with songs from the likes of Bob Dylan and John Prine.\n\nMore information on these and other pending rock albums can be found below.
