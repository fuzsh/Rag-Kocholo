        "text": "Jimi Hendrix was murdered by his manager, according to a new book by one of the guitarist's former roadies. James \"Tappy\" Wright has claimed that manager Michael Jeffrey confessed to making Hendrix swallow sleeping pills, because he hoped to collect on his client's life insurance policy.\n\nJeffrey feared being replaced with a new manager, Wright writes in his book Rock Roadie, and decided Hendrix was \"worth more to him dead than alive\". Jeffrey was allegedly the beneficiary oo the guitarist's $2m life insurance policy (worth around £1.2m in 1970).\n\nAccording to Wright, Jeffrey told him about the crime in 1971 – a year after 27-year-old Hendrix was found dead in a London hotel. \"I had to do it, Tappy,\" Wright claims the manager said. \"You understand, don't you? I had to do it. You know damn well what I'm talking about ... We went round to [his] hotel room, got a handful of pills and stuffed them into his mouth ... then poured a few bottles of red wine deep into his windpipe.\"\n\nHendrix was found dead at the Samarkand Hotel on 18 September, 1970. The cause of death was recorded as barbiturate intoxication and inhalation of vomit.\n\n\"I can still hear [the] conversation,\" Wright wrote of Jeffrey's confession, \"see the man I'd known for so much of my life, his face pale, hand clutching at his glass in sudden rage.\"\n\nHendrix's manager died in a plane crash in 1973."
