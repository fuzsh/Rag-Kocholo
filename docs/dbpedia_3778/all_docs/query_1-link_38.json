I was born in Mali, but raised in France. I have worked across Europe, in France, Belgium and Switzerland before coming to the UK in June 2011.\n\nI am currently a midwife at Ealing Hospital NHS Trust, Southall, Middlesex. I am in the midst of becoming a FGM specialist midwife with which, I will be creating an FGM-specific clinic at the hospital. This will be known as \"The Hope Clinic.\" In 2014, I recently became a member of the FGM National Clinical Group.\n\nAderonke Gilbertson RN RM.\n\nAderonke qualified as a nurse in Nigeria and the UK. Since she qualified as a midwife in 1991 she has practiced in all areas of midwifery and took the Foundation Course in Critical Care for Obstetric Patients 2006.

Our predominant non white ethnicity in the area is sub Saharan African. I have also worked for several years in a health centre for asylum seekers and refugees, which is where I first learnt about the phenomenon of FGM and its effects on women. Since then I have presented to medical students about FGM and am committed to raising awareness among my colleagues.\n\nI also work in sexual health and gynaecology  I enjoy the luxury of being able to keep my brain (predominantly) on one part of the body for a whole day - unlike general practice!\n\nI worked in Sri Lanka at the start of the civil war in 1983, and in 2005 I worked in a rural clinic in Guatemala for three months. I am privileged to have travelled a lot over the years  hiking, cycling and backpacking - and have visited countries where FGM is practised. As long as I am fit enough I intend to continue to explore the world  a curiosity about and experience of other cultures helps me to broach difficult subjects with my patients with empathy and respect.\n\nMy partner and I lived and worked in New Zeland from 1994  2006 and we are now back in the UK to care for elderly parents. The opportunities for activism here are great, and there is much work to be done.\n\nGillian Smith MBE\n\nGillian trained as a midwife in Ninewells in Dundee qualifying in 1978. She then practiced as a midwife in Rutherglen Maternity Hospital and spent three years in the Sultanate of Oman, on secondment from Greater Glasgow Health Board. This was a very exciting time as she was part of a team, there to help improve the maternity services. During this time she delivered a number of babies some by breech but considers one of her most exciting experiences delivering triplets vaginally. She also was the first person to do ultrasound on pregnant women in the south of Oman. FGM was regularly carried out on the new born babies in this region.\n\nShe has worked with the RCM in Scotland since 1995 as a National Officer and since April 2008 as Director. She has extensive experience of representing members in different settings. Gillian completed an MSc in Industrial Relations from Stirling University and sits on the Employment Appeals Tribunal in Scotland having been appointed to that in 2003.\n\nGillian sits on Police Scotland HBV working group and also on the Scottish Government working group around FGM.\n\nMarried in 2006 she inherited a ready made family complete with grand-daughter.\n\nDr. Joanne Topping MB ChB FRCOG\n\nI am a Consultant Obstetrician at Liverpool Women's Hospital. Liverpool Women's is one of the largest purpose built maternity units in Europe delivering approximately 8000 women a year. When planning the services at the new hospital we were lucky that to an extent the needs of our established multicultural community was recognised and an antenatal clinic established to serve our ethnic minority population. I am lucky to work with a great multidisciplinary team within this clinic and thus tend to see most of the women who have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nWhilst supporting those who work hard to abolish FGM, my main focus is teaching doctors and midwives how to support those women who have already undergone FGM and offer training to all staff in the techniques used to \" open \" women to allow for safer delivery."
