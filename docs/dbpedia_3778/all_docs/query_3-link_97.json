        "text": "Toks Odebunmi, veteran broadcaster, tells ‘NONYE BEN-NWANKWO about growing up and how he set up Obalende Suya, London\n\nWhy did you leave your broadcasting job in Nigeria here to go to the UK?\n\nWhilst I was here, I had realised early enough I wasn’t going to last on the job. It wasn’t as if I didn’t like it. After all the razzmatazz that comes with the job – a whole lot of girls running after you, you are so popular – and all the other stuff; but then, the reality is how much was I earning then? I started with the likes of John Momoh and the rest. When I decided to go to the UK, I had had three options and they were either I chose federal (NTA) or I worked in an advertising company or travelled abroad.\n\nSo you chose travelling abroad?\n\nYes. I didn’t really know anybody there though I had a friend. I looked into the future and I felt the job as a broadcaster might not deliver the aspiration I had looked forward to as a kid. I had always wanted to get into advertising. I decided it was the best time for me to travel abroad and study something on advertising. I started a course in advertising but then, I have always been an entrepreneur. I just felt I could set up a suya spot. We always go out to buy Suya in Nigeria. So I decided to get into it and it caught fire.\n\nSuya business in Nigeria is usually believed to be meant for ‘abokis,’ didn’t you feel somehow getting into a business that so many people look down on in Nigeria?\n\nI grew up with my mother who was a seasoned trader. She always told me to be proud of whatever I am doing as long as it is legitimate. It doesn’t matter at all. You have educated guys cleaning toilets and doing other odd jobs in the UK. I didn’t have an issue with the suya business at all. I have always been close to the ground. I am a level-headed person. I have never really seen myself as a big celebrity who must be driven in a Rolls Royce. I am a natural person. I don’t arrogate any level of class to whatever I do.\n\nHow did you get into broadcasting?\n\nI actually went straight into broadcasting from high school. I went to Abeokuta Continuing Education Centre after leaving secondary school because I needed to retake some papers. It was there that I got into radio. I discovered I had a fantastic voice. My dad was a chorister and he had a fantastic voice that you could pick out. My father gave me a note to give his friend, Bisi Lawrence, at Radio Lagos. I did and my dad’s friend asked me to go to the News Department. I was proof-reading in that department. Eventually, I was moved to the Current Affairs department where I worked with Segun Babatope, Dele Alake (they were my seniors). Eventually, I found myself on radio. That was how I got into broadcasting. When Lagos Television was set up, I worked in the TV and radio. I was one of the first newscasters in LTV.\n\nHow did you feel back then when people longed to meet you because of your voice?\n\nIt was great! They were days of ‘airmail’ when people would write letters and post them and it would take about one or two weeks before you got the letters. It was fun. I had a lot of admirers and of course, they were all girls. A man is always excited when a woman is crazy about him. It was a thrill for me then.\n\nHow do you see today’s OAPs who fake their accent in order to sound American?\n\nFor you to come near a broadcasting house during our time, you needed to go to the ‘clinic’ which is the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria. All the old school broadcasters including Soni Irabor, myself, John Momoh, we all passed through the school. We were taught Queen’s English. If I take a look at the flavour of broadcasting we have now from a business angle, I would say the stations are giving the audience what would excite them. Marketing is about what sells. Professionally, I would choose the Queen’s English.\n\nWould you remember if you committed blunder while on air?\n\nIt was a live broadcast. I was reading the news and I tried to get rid of a mosquito that perched on my skin. The mosquito was so stubborn. I kept trying but it wasn’t moving. I just had to brush it off and pretend as if nothing happened while I continued reading the news. When you are on radio, it is a different ball game. You can place your two legs on the table and read the news, nobody is watching you. You can get away with anything.\n\nSo have you left broadcasting entirely?\n\nI do voice over. I have not read news in the last three years. I use the voice over to support my charity. I have always loved to support charity. Every time you do things unconditionally and you try to help the less privileged, God pays you back more than five folds. I may not be a typical church goer but I know I get my blessings from giving to charity. God has blessed me with a good voice. It is not a talent. The talent is that I use the voice well. And since He blessed me with this good voice, I think it is proper for me to do something in return by helping the needy.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about growing up?\n\nI come from a humble background. There was the need for me to earn money to support my mother. When I left primary school, I needed to wait for two years before getting into secondary school because I had to wait for my other siblings who were already in secondary school to finish. My mother was a single parent. I grew up very quickly from a boy to a man. I used to sell stuff on the ground at Oyingbo (Lagos) market. I still drive past the exact spot sometimes. My mum used to run a canteen as well. I always helped her to sell at the canteen. I would even go to the shop on Sundays to help her prepare what she would use to cook the next day. I don’t know why people think I am an aje butter. I have tasted the real bottom side of life and I really enjoyed it because it prepared me for almost anything. I didn’t plan to go and do suya in London. I just went there and after a few days, I told my friend that this thing would sell and that was how Obalende Suya came about in the UK.\n\nIn those days of humble beginning, did you ever imagine you would one day become popular?\n\nOf course, not. I couldn’t have thought about that when I was in primary and secondary school. But during my years in broadcasting, I knew it was bound to happen. My mum would always tell me not to get carried away with the fame. I still needed to go to the university, so I didn’t allow the fame to get into my head.\n\nOh, so you went to a university while on the job as a broadcaster?\n\nYes. I trained myself. I had started earning money even before I left secondary school. So when I started working, I had to further my education and I was able to take care of my mother as well. I was very close to her. That was why I bought a house for her. I thought that was the first thing I had to do when I became more successful. I had in planned to get two or three jobs in the UK and get my mother somewhere to live. She had always dreamt of leaving a rented apartment and moving into her own home. By God’s grace, I was able to fulfil her dream before she passed on.\n\nHow was it growing up without a father figure?\n\nI lived with my sister when I was little before I lived with my mother and then, I lived with my brother. My mother had always imbibed in us to make the best out of every opportunity. My mum was very hard working. If you want a child to be fulfilled and quickly take on the challenges of life, then you must take them through it. I grew up with the idea that my mum was a single parent but I would go and visit my father once in a while. But I knew that I had my mum and my siblings.\n\nHow close are you to your father now?\n\nHe is late. He died before I left Nigeria. He used to drive a Mercedes Benz then. I will not say we were very close. It wasn’t as if I hated him. I wouldn’t say there was even a gap. You would realise there is a gap if you had something and it was taken from you. I grew up into something I believe was wholesome. The only thing we would miss about him then was when we had money issues and such things.\n\nDidn’t your mother remarry?\n\nShe didn’t. She dedicated herself to her children.\n\nAt what point did you meet your wife and how easy was it for you to choose her among the number of admirers you had then?\n\nWe met at a party. I still drive past the venue of the party sometimes. She was wearing a red dress. I still call her ‘Lady in Red.’ She knows how to dance. She is from Lagos. She has a carnival spirit in her so she loves dancing a lot. She stood out at the party. It wasn’t as if I was ‘hunting.’ But she was just irresistible. I found her to be very special and original. I just knew when I met her that she was my wife.\n\nDidn’t she give you tough time before she agreed to date you?\n\nTough time? Me? I am a handsome dude! I was in top demand then. I would even joke with her and tell her she was lucky I had time for her. When a guy loves a woman, she knows it. It was just smooth-sailing for us.\n\nWas there any form of racism when you got to the UK?\n\nWhen I got there in 1986, it wasn’t as bad as it was five years or so earlier. It wasn’t visible. I learnt it was bad before we came. But something we could call ‘institutionalised’ racism was still there. We could only do menial jobs. I considered myself as an economic refugee when I got to the UK. I was just there to study, make money and go back to my country. I actually went to the UK on a study leave. I felt I could go there and study and come back home. I had prepared my mind that I would come across racism. But the racism we suffer in the UK is not as heavy as the tribalism we suffer in Nigeria. I had my first suya spot at Elephant and Castle station in the UK. That place is the gateway to South East London where most Nigerians live even till now. I realised that for every 20 persons passing in front of our shop, there would be three blacks and only one of those three might be a Nigerian. I realised that if I had a good number of non Africans passing in front of my shop, I must do something to cater for their needs. There was no point sitting down there and waiting for Nigerians to come and buy suya, we might as well expand. Somebody would come to buy something and you just have boli and suya and you would need to translate what such meals meant. I decided we could be preparing chips as well, after all, everybody eats chips. I decided to employ an English guy. Obviously, we got busier, more people started coming. But some black students came from one university and asked why I should employ a white person when we suffer racism in the UK. I told them the sole purpose of the business was for it to survive. We had had a spate of failed black owned businesses that failed. I told them unless somebody was going to give me grant, I would do all I could to move the business forward, even if it meant using a white man to make money. If at the end, the business didn’t survive, it would have gone down in history that another black person owned a business that went down the drain. When I started, I couldn’t afford to get a shop; I took a caravan and turned it to a shop. We were operating from a make-shift porter cabin. It was from there we grew to afford a shop and restaurants.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Left for my father who was a vulcaniser, the greatest wish was that I ended up an Islamic scholar. Early in life, I was enlisted in a local Quranic school and didn’t get to start any formal education till the age of 10. Even as a young child, I always abhorred injustice and cheating. I took it upon myself to fight for the rights of others. I hated and still hate any form of injustice and I felt that the legal profession offered the platform to be able to forestall cheating and fight for the rights of others.\n\nSo you didn’t consider your father’s choice for you?\n\nI was in Arabic school for the first 10 years of my life and went through all the tutelage including occasional flogging by the teachers. Looking back, I wouldn’t also blame my father for wanting me to be an Islamic scholar. I believe that we exist not just for this world but also hereafter. If you’re oriented in the ways of the word of God through the Holy Quran, you’re not likely to go astray. So, he meant well.\n\nDid he accept your decision to become a lawyer instead of an Islamic scholar?\n\nAs soon as he realised that I was determined to pursue law as a career, his excitement changed and at that time, you could talk of the exploits of Chief Ijaodola, who was then a prominent Offa indigene, ruling the legal waves in Kwara State. He naturally admired Ijaodola and felt that maybe it would not be bad after all if his son turned out to be another Ijaodola. As soon as he knew I had made up my mind to study law, he gave his consent to it and encouraged me. The choice was not entirely an easy one to make given that throughout my primary and secondary school days, I had serious flair for writing. Even in secondary school, I was publishing a magazine called ‘Cuckoo’ and I recall that I had a column called ‘Koboko’ in the magazine. Koboko had no friends and no enemies; it was only interested in telling things the way they were. So I ran into problems with the school authorities several times because I was unsparing in my criticisms. The magazine became very popular in my school – Ansar-u-deen College, Offa and students looked forward to it every week and saved money to buy it. So, I was the President of the Press Club and also that of the Literary and Debating Society in my school. I was representing my school in most competitions; so naturally, I also toyed with the idea of studying mass communication. I also thought about being a diplomat. Eventually I settled for law, largely informed by my desire to correct the ills of the society and fight for others.\n\nDid you have to cram to be a lawyer?\n\nThe legal profession is not as mystical as some people think. Yes, there are a number of books that you have to read but you are allowed to bring these books into the courtroom. As a matter of fact, I’m of the opinion that when lawyers are tested under examination conditions, they should be allowed to come with their books. It doesn’t mean they are going to pass or fail because you can assemble all the books in the world, and still fail to apply those books to the practical realities. You must be able to relate your knowledge to the practical realities.\n\nHow do you sleep at night knowing you might have defended the guilty person?\n\nWell, there is distinction between perception and reality, between conjecture and speculation and the law is not concerned about all that. The law is concerned about proof of a crime beyond reasonable doubt. We cannot sit in the confines of our offices and pronounce anyone guilty of an offence. That will be judgmental. If anyone seeks my services, it will be unethical for me to decline. Again, it will be unethical for me to defend a client who has confessed to me that he has committed an offence. If anyone does that, I know the advice to give. If you approach your job with diligence and conscience, nobody will call you a liar. I’m not saying there are no few bad eggs in the profession who try to breach ethics.\n\nHave you ever regretted taking up a case?\n\nI have never found myself in that situation. For instance, I take up every case out of conviction. I also take up cases with the desire to serve the society and assist my client. I reflect deeply before taking up cases and the few cases I have handled so far, I have never had any regrets. So I don’t have sleepless nights because I don’t cheat clients. I don’t collect money without rendering any services. I’m guided by my conscience.\n\nWhat inspires your dress sense because I once saw a picture of you in an Arabian outfit?\n\nI think my dress sense is informed by the occasion. I look formal when attending a formal occasion and I may also be traditional when attending a traditional occasion. Sometimes I just try to be different and that informed the attire you made reference to. I believe that your appearance determines how you are addressed. I would say I’m a simple dresser, who values neatness and dressing to meet the occasion.\n\nDoes your wife also assist in shopping for you?\n\nI can describe my wife as a jewel of inestimable value. She does most of my shopping for me and I also do most of hers because I’m very fond of her. I have an idea of how I want her to look, so I try to go out of my way to shop for her. I even go to the market to shop for household items for her. I buy assorted meats and stuff like that for her. There is hardly a day I go home to my wife without buying something along however small it is, even if it is a loaf of bread. I believe that your responsibility as a person is determined by how you conduct yourself at home. I also make a lot of sacrifices and I believe in spending time with my family. You can’t be holier than the Pope. I believe that most of the problems we have in the society arise from the breakdown in ethical and moral values, institutions, societal traditions, so everything boils down to the family unit.\n\nSo what happens when your wife doesn’t like a dress you have bought for her or vice versa?\n\nMany a times if I don’t like it, I will pretend to like it. But I must admit that at times when I buy something for her that she doesn’t like, she will be forthright to tell me that she does not like it. I try not to feel bad; I try to learn from such experiences so I will know what to shop for next time. I believe that there must be bonding. So we communicate and try to shower each other with gifts because a marriage is for life while a wedding is just for the day. So you need to continue to oil the relationship. I don’t discuss my wife with a third party. I don’t report her to anybody and she also does not do that, so when we fight, which is occasionally, we settle it between ourselves.\n\nYou are a Muslim, yet you have been talking about one wife. Why do you have one wife?\n\nI have one wife and by the grace of God, I want to keep it that way. Maybe I’ve not married a second wife because I love my wife, maybe because I don’t want to create future problems for her, maybe because I don’t want to have crises at my exit, maybe because I believe you cannot share love equally between two women. I’m a Muslim and I can marry up to four wives provided I can treat them equally. So I want to stick to one wife and God helping me, I don’t want to marry another one. I’m contented with the wife God has given to me.\n\nPeople say lawyers have one vice or the other, which could be womanising, smoking or any other. Which one is yours?\n\nI had my own fair share of women before I got married. I was a ladies’ man before I got married but when I met my wife and saw the good virtues in her; I thought there was no need to look any further. So I’m a born-again in that regard, even though it might be difficult to have extreme loyalty, you can still have absolute respect for your wife. I don’t want to do anything to hurt her feelings. Some people play away matches, I don’t indulge in such. I try as much as possible to stay focused, committed and remain loyal to my wife. I don’t want any future crisis.\n\nCan you still remember the lines you used when you first made your interest known to her?\n\nYes, when I met my wife, I remember using the expression- I developed funny feelings. The first day I saw her, I knew she would be my wife because I actually had an unusual kind of feelings. And I didn’t want to let go. So for me, it was love at first but I don’t know how it was for her. I told her, ‘I want to marry you’. She just laughed. I think I proposed to her the first day and thereafter I started doing the chasing until it eventually ended in marriage.\n\nWhat is your family like? You have not said anything about your children.\n\nBy tradition, we don’t count the number of children. I can identify four for now. My first son is a final year medical student. My second son is going to the final year at the University of Lagos, a law student. My third child is a girl and she has just gained admission to UNILAG to also study law and the last one is in secondary school.\n\nFor the two of them studying law, did you have a hand in it?\n\nI believe in every child being allowed to do what they want to do. So I didn’t influence their decision to study law in any way.\n\nHow many calls do you get daily because you’re often seen on TV or read in the newspapers reacting to issues?\n\nI run a very busy schedule. I practise law and also teach law at the University of Lagos. I’ve been teaching law for close to 15 years and practising law for close to 30 years. I’m also involved in legal commentary. When issues break out, with all modesty, I’m one of the lawyers who are consulted. And I see that as a privilege not to abuse the public space. I believe that a lawyer must contribute ideas to make the society move forward. He must not stand aloof. The advocacy of a lawyer should go beyond the courtroom. So when I’m not practising law, I’m busy teaching law; when I’m not teaching law, I’m involved in one legal commentary or the other. When I’m not giving interviews to one television station or another, I’m busy writing. I maintain columns in some of the newspapers. I’m a very busy person and some of my best friends are journalists because I feel comfortable in their company. As early as 5am, my telephone is ringing. For nearly 30 years now, I’ve not gone on vacation. I’ve always been working. Some people have been imposing it upon me to take a break, telling me that it is not good not to take vacation.\n\nBut I’m constantly tinkering with the idea of becoming great. I want to be a great person. I want to leave my society better than I met it. So I receive between 40 and 50 calls daily from journalists, friends and people with requests for some form of assistance. I’m also conscious of the need to give back to the society.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In this interview with‘NONYE BEN-NWANKWO, the TV presenter talks about her talk show and her growing up days\n\nYou already have a grandchild, could it be that you married early or your child got married early?\n\nI got married at the age of 18. I had my daughter when I was 20. I will be 58 in December and she will be 38 then. I would say we grew up together. We are very good friends.\n\nDo you mean you are above 50?\n\nIt is absolutely the grace of God. I eat a lot. I love food. I eat all kinds of food. But then, I have the discipline to work out. I always find a way to balance it. I have not eaten white rice in almost 20 years, I eat brown rice. I don’t eat eba except once in a while. I cook all my meals, so I know what I want. There are some things I follow but I will not call myself a strict dieter. I found out that when you do all those regimented dieting; you might fall off the wagon. When I was younger, I used to exercise six hours daily.\n\nBut some women no longer bother about their body and look when they clock 50 and feel nobody looks at them again.\n\nDoing it because you want to show off to somebody is the wrong attitude. But for me, this is what I like; this is the way I want to look. My daughter loves me the way I look and she is so proud to show me off. I want to take care of this body that God created. That way, it keeps me going.\n\nYou must love your daughter so much because you keep mentioning her…\n\nShe is my only child, I love her so much.\n\nIs it by choice that she is your only child or what?\n\nI want to say it is by choice. I am not like the typical woman who wants to have a home filled up with children. For me, the more children you have, the more the quality of upbringing drops and the more you spread the attention.\n\nYour opinion is so foreign…\n\nI agree. I know I sound so foreign and my friends tell me I should not have come from this part of the world. But God knows me and this is why He allowed me to marry at 18 and have my child at 20.\n\nWasn’t 18 too young to have been married?\n\nIf I hadn’t married at 18, I don’t think I would have married. I have always known what I wanted. My dad objected but I told him that was what I wanted.\n\nBut then, wouldn’t you have missed your youth since you were already tied down in marriage at such a youthful age?\n\nMy dad was a disciplinarian, so I wasn’t much of a party person then. But I had that liberty when I got married. My ex-husband was a pilot. He was the DJ at the air force mess. Every Friday was disco night. I would dance and dance. He allowed me to enjoy my youth. I got into acting and modelling when I got married. I already had a child when I acted in Mirror in the Sun but most people didn’t know I was married. They didn’t think a married woman would be playing the kind of roles I played.\n\nSo why didn’t you continue with acting?\n\nMy ex-husband had to go to war college. I left with him and I went to school. When he came back and I started my fashion house, he was made the governor and I became the first lady and we went to our state. I came back and I got busier with my fashion house. I still get offers but there are just one or two producers I would want to work with.\n\nWhat inspired your latest TV show, Udy Factor?\n\nI used to have a talk show, His Word Made Flesh, before now and it really touched lives. The show kind of boxed me because it was a Christian show, I couldn’t get sponsors. For six years that we were on air, everything came from my pocket. During that time, I would meet so many people who would just tell me the story of their lives. I found out that these people didn’t really have information on what they were going through. So when I rested the talk show, I stood in front of my mirror and I asked God what next. He said I should start another programme and empower people with information. That was just it. God said He has given me youth so I should start with empowering people with information on how to age gracefully. Eventually, I found out that talking about ageing would also box me into a corner. There are so many things people need information on. The few episodes I recorded, I invited a couple of friends to come and watch. I found out that the programme elicited so many reactions. There was a lot of discourse and argument. But one thing that resonated among them was that they were imparted with information.\n\nHow do you come about the topics you discuss?\n\nI sit with people and I hear the things they talk about. I always pray and God gives me topics. I will talk about incest because it is gaining ground now in our society. Most mothers are not friends with their daughters. Your child cannot open up to you. We will talk about corruption. As much as we are shouting change, we all should make changes in the way we do our things. The man who tampers with the meter at the fuel station is also corrupt. We talk about court injunction. Why would you hide under ‘court injunction’ instead of going to defend yourself? Why would an accused person be easily granted a court injunction? What we really lack in our society is information and Udy Factor is just meant for that. Most men do not even know that they are entitled to alimony when they get divorced from their wives. Alimony is not strictly for women alone. Most divorced women do not even know that the ‘maintenance allowance’ they get from their ex husband can even increase if the status of their ex-husband goes higher.\n\nDo you miss your days as a First Lady?\n\nAbsolutely not! I don’t like all those paraphernalia that come with the title. In fact, I was a different first lady during my time. The first day I got to Akwa Ibom as a first lady, we got to the airport at Calabar and my classmates had come to the airport to welcome me. As soon as I got out of the plane, one of them screamed my name and I screamed her name and I started running to meet her and they all started running towards me. My security details and protocol officers just blocked them and I lambasted them and told them never again should they do such. I used to throw parties for women and tell them not to tie wrappers or wear boubou when coming for my event. I would tell them to dress smart. The office afforded me the opportunity to do something for women. As a first lady, you decide what you want. If you want the paraphernalia or you don’t want people to have access to you, all well and good. Because of the way I looked, most people felt I must be full of myself. But they got to realise eventually that I was so down to earth. I had a lot of fun but really, I don’t miss it.\n\nDon’t you get lonely at times as you are no longer married and your only child lives abroad?\n\nNo. The height of maturity is when you can enjoy your own company. The only people that come to my house are the people I allow to visit me. I love this quiet life. I don’t party. There is so much to read and learn and there is so much to pray and sing praises for. Loneliness is a sign of immaturity.\n\nDid you get closer to God because you had challenges in your marriage?\n\nI want to make it clear to you that I didn’t have challenges in my marriage. It just didn’t work out. My ex and I are very good friends. I am a free-spirited person. I always laugh. But to answer your question, I was a judge at the Face of Africa pageant where Oluchi won. Before I travelled to SA for the event in 1998, I heard a voice that said I should stop whatever I was doing, that He had a work for me. Before then, I was just a Sunday Sunday Christian. I heard the voice three times. I remember somebody asked me who I felt was talking to me and I told the person I think it was God. The person just laughed and said he wondered how God would choose to talk to someone like me that was always wearing miniskirts? In 1999, I dreamt that my fashion house was gutted by fire and two days later, fire actually razed it. I lost N30m in that fire. After that, I started selling my property one after the other because I needed money to go back to fashion. But each time, the money would fizzle out. I set up a fashion house in my house but in one month, my tailors destroyed everything. I just gave out all my sewing machines and I said, ‘God, here I am, what do you want me to do?’ That was how God started working in my life. So it wasn’t really a ‘challenge’ that drove me to God. It was just that God had a purpose for me.\n\nYou don’t cover your head or wear long dresses as a born again, how do you explain that?\n\nOh no! It is my heart with God. Initially when I started the Word Made Flesh, because of the colour of my hair (I have worn this blond colour forever), some people would send me text and say I look like Queen Jezebel. I would just laugh. But then, three months down the line, I was getting incredible emails and text messages. People would tell me I made worshipping God beautiful. Some would say if everybody who worships God dresses like me; it would make it easier for them to worship God. God created the peacock and made it so beautiful. He created the zebra and made it so beautiful. God sculpted the giraffe ad made it so elegant. So why shouldn’t I look good? I see some people and I tell them I don’t want to know the god that made them look and dress the way they do. The God I know is a beautiful God.\n\nAt 58, have you ruled out marriage?\n\nI still get marriage proposals every day. My flesh says no to marriage but I don’t know what God has in stock for me. I will do His will.\n\nSo you are saying men still toast you?\n\nDo I look toastable?\n\nOf course you do.\n\nThen you have your answer! Men still toast me all the time.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
