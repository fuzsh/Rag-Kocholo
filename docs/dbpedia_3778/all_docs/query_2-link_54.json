        "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed the Chief Executive Officer of Channels Television, Mr. John Momoh, as the acting chairman of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) Governing Council.\n\nThe is contained in a letter dated August 21, 2020, and signed by the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono.\n\nThe letter which is titled, ‘Emergency Meeting of the Governing Council of University of Lagos’ with reference number FME/PS/606/C.1/III/129, charged Momoh to convene an emergency council meeting with the objective of approving the nomination of the Acting Vice-Chancellor for the university.\n\nThe letter read in part, “I am directed to request you to convene an emergency meeting of the governing council to consider and, if found suitable, approve the Senate nomination of the Acting Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos in line with the enabling Act.\n\n“You are to preside at the meeting in the absence of the substantive pro-chancellor/chairman of council who has had to recuse himself in line with the visitor’s directives.\n\n“You are to also submit a report on the decision of the council to the visitor through the honorable minister of education immediately thereafter.”\n\nThe authenticity of the letter is being confirmed by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education, Mr. Ben Gong.\n\nGong said, “The letter is authentic. It was approved by the visitor (Buhari).”\n\nMomoh is currently the President of the UNILAG Alumni Association and a veteran journalist.\n\nThe UNILAG Senate had, on Monday, voted Prof. Folasade Ogunsola as the acting VC, making her the first woman to hold such a position in the school’s 58-year history."
