he is a man of infectious zeal, boundless energy and patriotic.\n\n“He was a bridge-builder and an ardent believer in one Nigeria,” he said.\n\nChief Segun Osoba, former governor of Ogun said that the contributions of former Governor Lateef Jakande of Lagos State to the media profession was too monumental to be documented.\n\nOsoba said that Jakande’s success and contributions to journalism exceeded his contributions to government.\n\n“He was the first president of NGE, the first president of NPAN, the first African to be the Chairman of the International Press Institute that is made up of editors all over the world and publishers,’’ he said.\n\nMr. Kabiru Yusuf, President, NPAN said the event was aimed at remembering and celebrating “media titans” who passed on.\n\n“They lived an eventful and impactful life.\n\n“There are traces of them everywhere; in the families that they raised, the colleagues they mentored and the institutions they led.\n\n“That is why we do not think of them in the past tense but in the present and future,’’ Yusuf said.\n\nMr. Nduka Obaigbena, Publisher, Thisday described Malam Wada Maida, Past President, Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) as a quiet operator, who was always effective in his endeavours.\n\nObaigbena added that Maida, who was also a former Managing Director and Chairman of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) helped to revive the NGE in 1988.\n\n“When he left NAN, he built a headquarters for them, organised the entire place and decided to go into private business.\n\n“He was one of the early investors in Daily Trust Newspapers and also the key investor in People’s Daily,’’ he said.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Vanguard Media Ltd, Mr Sam Amuka described the former President of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ), Malam Ismaila Isa, as a man who spent his life servicing other people’s lives and organisations.\n\nHe added that Isa, who was also a patron of the Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), was a blessing to the Nigerian media.\n\n“He used his influence to raise funds to rebuild the new NIJ House in Victoria Island at no cost to the NIJ,’’ he said.\n\nThe Chairman, Channels Television, Mr. John Momoh also paid tributes to the former Director-General, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Mr. Sam Egbuna, whom he described as a thoroughbred journalist whose footprints can be felt in both private and public space.\n\nAccording to Momoh, Egbuna, who was also an Executive Director of Voice of Nigeria (VON), believed in doing the right things, doing things right and practising journalism with integrity.\n\n“He was a living proof on how a fine journalist should be; a good friend to many.’’\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Diamond Publications Ltd, Mr. Lanre Idowu described Mr. Eddie Aderinokun, former Editor, Daily Express as a multi-talented artist, who was at home in journalism but also in music and sports.\n\nIdowu said that Aderinokun was a man of high standards in lifestyle, home life and profession.\n\nHe noted that Aderinokun wrote nine poetries, including ‘Ebony of Snow’, ‘Indigo Tears’ and ‘Dark Things are Here’.\n\nIn his tribute, Mr. Tony Akiotu, Managing Director, Daar Communications Ltd described Mr. Bisi Lawrence, former General Manager, Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation as a man, whose administrative and organisational skills were matchless.\n\nAkiotu said that Lawrence, popularly known as “Biz Law” was an inspiration, an enigma, a man who paid respect to details and one who would settle for nothing less.\n\n“His contribution to sports remains legendary,’’ Akiotu said.\n\nMr. Lade Bonuola, Consultant, Guardian Newspapers Ltd described former Publisher, New Nation, Gbolabo Ogunsanwo, as a man who paid great attention to human capital development, with an assurance of staff keeping their jobs while still schooling.\n\nHe said Ogunsanwo, who was also a former Editor at Sunday Times was known for keeping public officials on their toes by demanding accountability.\n\n(NAN"
