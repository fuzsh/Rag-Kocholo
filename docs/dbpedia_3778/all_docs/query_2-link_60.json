        "text": "\"It will be a relief to get back home,\" says Louis Chambers, a student at Hull, who will be among more than a million students leaving university in the \"travel window\" which has now opened.\n\nBecause of Covid restrictions he has only been able to see his family in Norfolk once this term.\n\nHis university is operating a system of time slots for leaving, to avoid a rush on the roads or public transport.\n\nThe geology student had also arranged a Covid test before the Christmas break.\n\nLouis, a first year student at the University of Hull, will be collected by his parents, with the university running one-hour slots so there are \"not so many leaving at once\".\n\nBut he thinks the Covid testing and travel window have been uncomplicated so far - and he has enjoyed his first term.\n\nThe official travel window is between 3 and 9 December, but many students will have already left. Out of the six in Louis's flat, he said, three had already gone home.\n\nUniversity of Hull student services director Anji Gardiner has been organising the staggered departures.\n\nAs well as slots for those being collected by car - which run from 07:00 to 20:00 GMT - there are coaches being laid on and a booking system for the limited capacity on trains, with the numbers travelling spread out across the week.\n\n\"We want to keep it safe - we didn't want a log-jam of people trying to get home,\" Dr Gardiner said.\n\nBut many students heading home this week will not be returning to their universities for another nine weeks - as the government in England announced a staggered start to next term, with some students not back until 7 February.\n\nThe plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will see students returning over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching.\n\nThe first students returning from 4 to 8 January will be for hands-on, practical courses which are difficult to teach solely online - which will include medicine, nursing and dentistry, sciences which need to use laboratories, and music, dance and drama.\n\nOther subjects, such as English or history, would be taught online at the start of term, with students back between 25 January and 7 February.\n\nStudents will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure.\n\nBefore leaving for Christmas, students have been encouraged to have two tests three days apart - and to travel within 24 hours of receiving a second negative test result.\n\nIn England, about 1.2 million students will be travelling from a university to a home address in another part of the country, including:"
