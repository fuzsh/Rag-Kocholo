        "text": "Celebrating your own is an attitude worth imbibing and that is what this article is all about. I am going to take you on a journey as we take a look at the businessmen behind local brands in Nigeria. The Nigerian market has an avalanche of business brands that have transcended the borders of the country. Some of these brands are household names and are on their way to becoming multinationals.\n\nNigerian local brands have been doing remarkably well over the years as they are constantly evolving and becoming more relevant by the day. The value they offer has made Nigerians content with their products rather than go for foreign brands.\n\nDespite the negative press and the ever-present economic upheavals, Nigerian local brands have been competing favourably with multinationals and have even dwarfed them in some sectors in terms of valuation and perception. Nigerian local brands have not sat back and are satisfied with being local champions. A good number of them are expanding aggressively across the African continent and even beyond.\n\nLocal brands like Dangote Group, Access Bank, Globacom, UBA, GTBank, Zenith Bank, First Bank, etc have settled and are dominating the African market. Indeed, we can say that these brands are not merely domesticated but are major players in the African economic space.\n\nThe names behind the brands\n\nBehind every brand is a name. Every business once started as an idea in a man’s head. The multi-billion dollar companies you see today with sprawling infrastructures across cities were mere ideas in people’s heads. These ideas were put to fruition and today, we get to see and hear the names of these people. These men and women not only started but have worked assiduously to get to where they are today.
