        "text": "Born in Ebem, Ohafia, in the present day Abia State on November 6, 1917, llln world at Ebem Primary School, and later attended Hope Waddell Training Institute, Calabar from 1933 to 1936. Professor Eni Njoku also attended the Yaba High School from 1937 – 1939. He later studied Botany at the University of Manchester in England where he graduated with a First Class Degree in 1947. The following year, he obtained his Master’s degree, and became a P.hD holder in 1957 from the University of London. On return to Nigeria, Professor Eni Njoku became a Lecturer at the University College Ibadan.\n\nAt the University College, Professor Eni Njoku rose to the ranks of the Head of Botany department and as well as the Dean of the Faculty of Sicence. He was later appointed the Chairman of Electricity Corporation of Nigeria in 1956. It was in 1962 that Professor Eni Njoku became famous when he was appointed as the first ever Vice Chancellor of the newly established University of Lagos.\n\nWith this appointment, Professor Eni Njoku made history as the first Nigerian Vice Chancellor of any University in the world. His stay as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos was brought to an end in 1965 when he resigned from the position following the crisis that ensued over his re-appointment.\n\nHaving resigned his position as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Professor Eni Njoku became a visiting Professor at the University of Michigan in the United State of America. Professor Eni Njoku would go on to make another history in 1966 when he was appointed as the first ever Nigerian Vice Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\nWith this appointment, Professor Eni Njoku became not only the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos, and the first Nigerian Vice Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, but also, the first Nigerian to become the Vice Chancellor of two different Federal Universities in the country or anywhere in the world.\n\nProfessor Eni Njoku remained at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka until the outbreak of the civil war in 1967. Sadly, he passed away on December 22, 1974. In his lifetime, Professor Eni Njoku received numerous awards for his outstanding performances including a honorary D.Sc degree from the University of Nigeria in 1964, honorary doctor of law degree from the University of Michigan in 1966, and honorary D.Sc degree by the University of Lagos in 1973. Professor Eni Njoku also served on the Board of the Commonwealth Scientific Committee, the United Nations Advisory Committee on the Application of Science, UNESCO Advisory Committee in Natural Science, and as well as Council of Universities of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nEni Njoku Hostel, UNILAG\n\nMany years after his death, his landmark achievements in the institutions where he served can still be felt. Till date, there is a hostel at the University of Lagos and also the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, named after him. He was well loved and admired by many which was one of the reasons the students at the University of Lagos protested following his resignation as the University’s Vice Chancellor."
