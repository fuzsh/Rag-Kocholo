It is noteworthy that Superbrands Nigeria was franchised and licensed in Nigeria by Masterminds HRSG, which became effective on January 7, 2020.\n\nMeanwhile it released the list of members of the Superbrands Council Nigeria, with Nigeria’s doyen of Advertising, Dr. Abiodun Shobanjo, the Executive Chairman of the Troyka Group, as Chairman of Council. Dr. Biodun Shobanjo has about 50 years work experience in the Marketing Communications Industry with numerous industry awards marking the trail.\n\nThe Council comprise experts, luminaries and academics from the world of branding, marketing, advertising, organizational strategy and business.

Only brands which have been highly rated by the Superbrands Council and through cumulative research are granted the Superbrands Status.\n\nSpeaking on the voting processes, President, Superbrands Nigeria, Sabastine Okeke, said “We will ratify and review all brands in Nigeria across the categories based on the pedigree of the brand in the market, consumers feedback, reliability and the commercial value of the products in the market space stressing that brand integrity and competitiveness would deliver on it’s standards.\n\n“In order to manage voting errors, consumers will not be vulnerable with options adding that data analytics and scoring of brands will be used to validate the status before conferring Superbrands status on the winning brand. Superbrands is expected to push 10million votes to interface with the myriads of brands in the market space,” he added.\n\nHe noted that, 10million votes is the minimum number of votes that is required across all the categories and end users of brands to drive the needed aggressive publicity and earn good reputation in the market as the Superbrands Award winning brand of the year 2020.\n\nSuperbrands remains the world’s largest independent arbiter of branding, and pays tribute to the strongest and most valuable brands in the world through its annual awards, publications and national marketing programmes. As a global organisation which promotes the discipline of branding, Superbrands has launched programmes in about 100 countries including all the key global markets.
