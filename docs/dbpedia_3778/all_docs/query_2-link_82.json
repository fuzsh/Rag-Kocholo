She defeated Prof. Ben Oghojafor, Deputy VC (Development Services) who scored 31 votes while one vote was void.\n\nDr. John Momoh, president of the University of Lagos Alumni Association Worldwide emerged new interim chairman of UNILAG Governing Council last night. His first task was the ratification of the election of the acting VC, Prof Ogunsola.\n\nDaily Sun learnt the governing council meeting was virtual and the only item on agenda was the ratification of Prof Ogunsola.\n\nTop management staff of UNILAG told Daily Sun that the governing council which started its meeting at 11am approved the nomination of Senate acting VC.\n\nMeanwhile, details have emerged how six Federal Government appointees in the council boycotted the meeting. Only eight out of 14 participate in the meeting.\n\nThe Federal Government through the National Universities Commission (NUC) had asked the Registrar/Secretary to Senate and Council to immediately convene a meeting of the two bodies to nominate and confirm the appointment of a new acting VC.\n\nFederal Government nominees that boycotted the emergency council meeting included Bayo Adaralegbe, Rev. Yomi Kasali, Dr. Saminu Dagari, Alhaji Alli Hussien, Mr. Oluwarotimi Shodimu and Mr. Oladejo Azeez, registrar to council."
