        "text": "The recent launch in Lagos of ARISE Television, a sister company of THISDAY Newspapers after a two-year incubation period during which it successfully debuted in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas, shows the resilience of the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief, Nduka Obaigbena and his ability to re-invent himself after every challenge, writes Nseobong Okon-Ekong.\n\nThe venue of the event at the Sky Restaurant situated on the topmost floor of Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos was not only a metaphor for the quality of persons in the gathering, it was also a symbol of what Nduka Obaigbena, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of ARISE Television and THISDAY Newspapers desires for his latest enterprise, ARISE Television, which was formally presented in Nigeria that evening. It was a gathering of champions. Everyone at the event was at the top of their game.\n\nHis aspiration is to take ARISE to the top bracket of global television broadcast. Invitation to the official launch in Nigeria was for a high profile gathering of captains of industry, distinguished professionals, businessmen and public servants. At the get-together were a few distinguished billionaires with combined net-worth of over $50 billion. It was one of those rare occasions that pooled some of Africa’s richest men, including Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Messrs Jim Ovia, Femi Otedola, Oba Otudeko and Tony Elumelu in one room.\n\nAs the guests mixed freely, black-slapping and getting acquainted, jazz musician, Bezhiwa Idakula, better known as Bez filled the atmosphere with sweet sounds of music; largely the kind of melody you could tap your feet or nod your head to, while continuing the conversation with your ally.\n\nOn the right of the room, the glass panel allowed a spectacular view of the scene below. It kind of felt like everyone in the room was standing on top of the world. The glitter of lights on buildings and its reflection on the Kuramo Waters created a solemn panorama for those who wanted to be by themselves, nursing a drink, while looking out of the window.\n\nThe launch was supported by South Atlantic Petroleum whose Executive Vice Chairman, Senator Daisy Danjuma, was also present. Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan of Delta State who delivered a motivating speech ahead of other eminent speakers like Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Messrs Femi Otedola, Tony Elumelu, Emeka Mba, John Momoh, Mrs Maiden Ibru, Mrs. Evelyn Oputu and Senator Udo Udoma praised Obaigbena’s resilience and expressed hope that the television network would change the perception of the world about Africa.\n\nOvia extricated a promise from all the CEOs present to support ARISE with advertising for one year. His proposal was well received and even got the express backing of Dangote.\n\nThe arrival of ARISE Television in Nigeria follows a two-year incubation period during which the television network which is poised to “bring Africa to the world and the world to Africa” successfully debuted in Europe, Middle East and the Americas. Obaigbena, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of ARISE and its sister company, THISDAY Newspapers, described the launch of ARISE in Nigeria as the dawn of a new era and a home-coming.\n\nPopulated with a team of seasoned global journalists with a wide scope of experience, ARISE Television can be viewed on DStv channel 416 and GOtv channel 44 respectively.\n\nMichael Wilson, Global Business Editor, had previously worked for Sky TV for 20 years, said ARISE brings the global business news to a local audience and to make business news that everyone can use. It is important to interpret the global event whether in Europe or America because it has a huge impact on everybody. We are so interconnected. ARISE is interested in ordinary people.”\n\nThe testimony from Deji Badmus, a pioneer staff of ARISE, attests to the fact that it has not been an easy ride. He said the arrival of ARISE was a dream come true he was hopeful that the television network would break boundaries because Obaigbena does not censor what goes out. Badmus is the network’s Lagos correspondent monitoring politics and current affairs.\n\nDescribing his impression when he was first intimated with the vision of the television network, Charles Aniagolu said everyone who heard it was amazed and there was skepticism because of the tremendous money and professionalism involved.\n\nRob Beynon, a former executive producer with ITN and Sky News and now International Head of Operations at ARISE NEWS, said a team of TV news experts had been assembled from around the globe.\n\nLyne Pitts, a former Vice President of NBC News and an Executive Producer with CBS America is heading up the US operation from a vast studio complex in New York. Ms Pitts explained: “We want to present programming that truly reflects the voices of America, not just a small slice but the racial, ethnic and socio-economic diversity of this country. ‘From that perspective, ARISE NEWS will cover all issues education, health, politics and the criminal justice system. From Main Street to Wall Street, from the G8 to the Grammy’s.”\n\nDirector of US News and Operations is award-winning broadcaster Gary Anthony Ramsay who has covered conflicts from Kosovo to Iraq. Nigerian born John Chiahemen, a former Reuters bureau chief, has been appointed Managing Editor – and Head of Africa. David Glencorse, a former Sky News anchorman, international reporter and Royal Television Society award winner, is the Global Editorial Director of the company. Nick Jennings, a former Head of International News at Sky News is Director of News and News Gathering. And Gavin Hill, until recently an award winning ITV producer of documentaries is Director of Features. James Blue, formerly an Emmy and Peabody award-winning producer with ABC News Nightline and NBC Today has been appointed Director of Current Affairs and Special Projects based in Washington. Said Mr Blue: “We want to tell the untold story, the stories of achievement and celebration. So much is happening in the world of business and so much is happening in the world of culture and sports. We want to cover all of that and provide people with stories on our stations they would never see anywhere else.’\n\nJeff Koinange, an Emmy award winning reporter and formerly CNN’s star Africa reporter will be based in Johannesburg as an anchorman and correspondent. Debbye Turner-Bell, a former CBS correspondent (and former Miss America) will be a regular anchor for ARISE America. South African born Heather Scott, a former Sky News anchorwoman and business correspondent, will take on the role of roving anchor and correspondent. And Neil Stainsby, formerly a senior director with the BBC has been appointed Global Lead Director across ARISE NEWS.\n\nObaigbena(pictured above) said: “We will attract a global audience interested in emerging markets, developing countries and evolving politics. With headquarters and bureaux throughout Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas, we are ready to speak to our audience and give them a voice as well.\n\n“We are a new international network established to reflect the new world order not hardwired to the old and built to reflect the modern way news is consumed. Nowhere is this more important than in the emerging economies.”\n\nHe stressed: “There will be no state funding and no state agenda. Our coverage will be balanced, comprehensive and completely independent. “Our efforts will concentrate on robust journalism anchored on imperatives of the marketplace.”\n\nObagbena is a living legend. He has chosen to live an exceptional life and it is both challenging and exciting, for him. He is frequently in the news for many reasons; sometimes for things that are not going so well, as well as for the good turn. Usually, the tricky part is how to get out of difficult situations. Obaigbena is a Nigerian prodigy. His place is assured in the top bracket of Nigerian media history with the likes of Chief Obafemi Awolowo who founded the Nigerian Tribune, Owelle Nnamdi Azikiwe who owned the West African Pilot, Chief Olu Aboderin, initiator of The Punch Newspapers, Mr. Alex Ibru, founder of the Guardian, and Bashorun MKO Abiola, proprietor of the Concord Newspapers.\n\nAfter a lot of badgering on all sides from the demanding task of starting and sustaining publications, he is still standing. Obaigbena has become an adept at going back to the drawing board, each time spanner is thrown in his works. He rolls up his sleeve and gets right back to work in an amazing feat of re-inventing himself, again and again.\n\nIt would be safe to say that it all started at the University of Benin where he earned a degree in Graphic Arts. His interest in the media trade began with his work as a cartoonist for the Nigerian Observer, while he was yet in school.\n\nHe was 28 in 1987 when he founded THISWEEK, a weekly news magazine. Since then, he has kept the template of the THISWEEK model in subsequent enterprise – breaking new grounds with aggressive business sense, flamboyance, recruiting some of the best professionals and injecting into their spirit an unsurpassed can-do mantra that fuels the system, even when the spirit is sometimes weigh down by extraneous circumstance. Apparently, his ambition was fired after working on the special section on sub-Saharan Africa of Time and Newsweek. THISWEEK was modeled after these publications.\n\nAlthough, it could not stand the test of time, THISWEEK was only a forerunner to announce the arrival on the Nigerian, African and global stage of a business magnate that would build one of the continent’s most influential media brand, THISDAY newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper came at a turbulent period in Nigeria’s socio-political history. It was the dark years of the Gen. Sani Abacha military rule and the press was one of the worst hit segments of society. The totalitarian regime proscribed three of the most vibrant publications: Punch, Concord and Guardian. It was at this difficult, yet auspicious period that THISDAY hit the streets.\n\nIf the regime expected it to be cowed, it was mistaken. The publisher himself became a target and after he was freed from a spell in detention, he went into exile and did not return until the demise of Abacha.\n\nTHISDAY is in its 20th year of unbroken run this year as a soar-away success in publishing. The newspaper offers many areas of study in business module for academics and professionals. It has broken many conventions. Before THISDAY, no one attempted to publish a daily newspaper without owing a press. Obaigbena did it! He went to blaze a trail. The newspaper opened the country’s first four-colour presses. THISDAY also started the tradition of circulating one edition of a daily throughout the country, by ensuring simultaneous printing in different parts of the country. The THISDAY phenomenon is captured in two words: ‘robust journalism’.\n\nIt has not been an exactly smooth run. Many unforeseen challenges lay on its path. Its widely acknowledged baptism of fire was in 2002, when Islamic fundamentalists who opposed the staging of the Miss World pageant in Nigeria vented their anger on the property of the publication. Two journalists on its stable, Godwin Agbroko, Abayomi Ogundeji and Samuel Famakinwa have lost their lives in circumstances that suggest persons were after them for doing their jobs. With the rise in insurgency in Nigeria, THISDAY offices in different locations have twice been hit by bomb blasts with resulting loss of lives and property.\n\nThe spirited attempt by THISDAY to establish a presence in South Africa could not be sustained. The life of the newspaper was snuffed out by potential investors who feared the enormous powers it would attain with its success. They stood by and watch in derision as paper struggled and eventually had to stop production after expending over R200 million.\n\nFive years after its launch, THISDAY had garnered enough goodwill and reputation to institute a respected reward platform. The annual THISDAY Awards is a prized plaque very much coveted by winners for celebrating outstanding achievements in good governance, business and professionalism. The award process is managed by the Nigerian affiliate of KPMG, the international auditing firm.\n\nThe successful awards, apparently, encouraged Obaigbena’s venture into promotion of Africa’s cultural asset in music and fashion. In his characteristic energetic style, he eclipsed every other record before him by bringing more international A-list artistes than anyone ever did in one concert in Nigeria. The THISDAY Music Festival set a new standard and provided a platform for local stars to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with global music icons. Its international version was known as Africa Rising. Having staged monumental shows to promote African culture, supporting it with an international quality magazine was the next logical step. Thus was born ARISE magazine! This became a very strong platform to project what is in vogue in Africa through the ARISE Fashion Week. The sheer volume of communication and electronic equipment and the quality of personnel deployed to execute the ARISE Fashion Week and THISDAY Music Festival might have committed Obaigbena’s thoughts to broadcasting.\n\nARISE Television has simple, bold and uncluttered mission, “to champion the voices of emerging and frontier markets. To promote and celebrate all that is African and Afropolitan across all continents, engaging citizens of the world in the biggest stories of the day.”\n\nIt’s another first for Obaigbena. He is the first Nigerian to simultaneously own a thriving newspaper and fledging international television network.\n\nArise.tv"
