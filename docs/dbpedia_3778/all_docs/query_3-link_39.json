        "text": "The University of Lagos Alumni Association came into existence in 1969, four (4) years after the first 41 graduates were turned out of the University that was established in 1962. The idea of the Alumni Association was conceived when it was considered necessary to create an organization that would embrace different generations of the University. The body was expected to play a dominant role in the life of the University by reflecting the views of its graduates.\n\nThe Alumni Association was formally launched on the 16th January, 1970 by the Pro-Chancellor, late Justice J. I. C. Taylor with the late Justice J. S. Mariere, then Chancellor of the University as the Chairman of the occasion. At that epoch making event, Mr. Kayode Anjorin, a 1966 graduate of Business Administration assumed office as the first National President of the Association. To enhance the smooth administration of the Association, the University established the Alumni Relations Unit in the office of the Vice Chancellor with an alumnus as the administrative officer whose mandate was to establish and maintain an enduring link between the University and its graduates, compiling an Alumni list and publishing a newsletter. In recent years, the University has merged the Alumni Relations Unit with the Endowment Unit forming the Office of Advancement under the global dispensation of developmental activities.\n\nOver the years, a lot of positive developments have been recorded in the management and administration of the Association which has since taken over the publication of the magazine “UNILAG ALUMNI” and the newsletter “THE GRADUATE”. The Association has also secured a permanent seat on the University’s Governing Council.\n\nHISTORY OF OUR PAST NATIONAL PRESIDENTS\n\nDuring their tenure and with the active support and encouragement of the University Administration, the Association established Branches and Chapters in various states of the Federation and the FCT, Abuja. Many programmes, including the Alumni Reunion, Annual Lecture series, and Distinguished Alumni Award Ceremony are organized regularly by the Association as part of its activities to encourage interaction among members and promote national discourse. The Association is not only interested in the academic progress of the University; it also recognizes the need to assist in its physical development. To this end, the Association embarked on the building of the Post Graduate Hall of residence in the University some years ago. Although hampered by lack of fund, the first phase attracted a distinguished Alumnus Dr. Erastus Akingbola who donated a four-storey building hostel to the University. Other donors include Dr. D.K. Olukoya (N150 Million for a Research Laboratory), The Sahara Energy Group (N300 Million – Charity Donation), Dr. M. I. Okoro (N5 Million for Chair Endowment).\n\nAbout us\n\nThe University of Lagos Alumni Association came into existence in 1969, four (4) years after the first 41 graduates were turned out of the University that was established in 1962.
