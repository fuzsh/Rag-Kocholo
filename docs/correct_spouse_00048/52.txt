Hong Kong superstar Nicholas Tse spoke about his troubled marriage to actress Cecilia Cheung for the first time on Sunday, almost two weeks after reports surfaced that he had filed for divorce.

Tse admitted that the marriage is in shambles at the premiere of his latest film, "Treasure Inn," in Beijing. "I miss her and love her, but I don't know how to work things out," Tse told a crowd of reporters.

Last week, Cheung broke her silence by blaming Tse for spreading rumors about her. But Tse insists the two still care about each other.

"Although I heard that she criticized me a few days ago, she told me she loved me and missed me so much yesterday through text messages," Tse said.

"I believe her. And I feel confident that whatever our relation is, we'll try hard to create a healthy and stable environment for our kids to grow up in."

Tse and Cheung both grew up with divorced parents, and they were determined not to follow their parents' route when their first son was born. "But now I don't know how to keep our relation going," Tse said.

Tse and Cheung were rumored to have split about a month ago when Tse didn't appear at Cheung's birthday party and Cheung was seen chatting with Edison Chen, with whom she had been involved in a racy photo scandal in 2008. The couple also was reported to be in a long assets dispute. They had two sons during their five-year marriage.
