Cecilia Cheung, 42, split from Nicholas Tse, 42, back in 2011 after five years of marriage.

Though Cecilia and Nicholas were granted joint custody of their two sons, Cecilia took on the role as primary caretaker of Lucas, 15, and Quintus, 12.

According to Hong Kong media, Cecilia receives S$14mil in alimony from Nicholas yearly. Which shouldn't be that shocking since Nicholas is worth an estimated S$190mil.

However, it's been reported that Ceci doesn't touch the money at all, and just saves it all in the bank.

Eldest son Lucas once revealed that his mum has been planning ahead for their future, and saves the alimony on their behalf so they can manage it themselves when they get older.

Cecilia would later share that she plans to pass all the money on to her sons only when she is old as she hopes they can learn to live independently first and not depend on their parents' money.

It should be known that Cecilia hardly needs to depend on Nicholas’ alimony for her family to have a cushy life.

The mum-of-three (she also has a four-year-old son, Marcus, whose father’s identity remains unknown) is extremely capable when it comes to making her own fortune.

Recently, it was reported that she made 20mil yuan (S$3.9mil) from just one live stream session in October.

And last year, she reportedly earned S$10.2mil in endorsement deals and variety show appearances after her very successful stint on Sisters Who Make Waves 2.
