HONG KONG Hong Kong pop star Nicholas Tse has confirmed rumors that he secretly married actress Cecilia Cheung, news reports said Saturday.

Tse and Cheung's romance has dominated Hong Kong's entertainment headlines for months. On Friday, Tse admitted he tied the knot with Cheung after dozens of reporters surrounded him and pressed for an answer, the Apple Daily said.

"I can only say that I have heard a lot of reports today," Tse said, referring to news that the couple married on a Philippine island. "Thanks for everyone's concern. I have married."

Tse then waved his hand briefly to show reporters his wedding ring, the report said.

But Tse, 26, declined to comment on rumors that the two got married because Cheung was pregnant, the Ming Pao Daily News reported.

Tse and Cheung recently starred together in mainland Chinese director Chen Kaige's fantasy epic "The Promise."

Tse was once romantically linked to Chinese pop diva Faye Wong, who is now married to mainland Chinese actor Li Yapeng.
