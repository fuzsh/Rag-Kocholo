        "text": "Thursday February 14, 2008 Hong Kong\n\nNicholas Tse (謝霆鋒) and Cecilia Cheung (張拍芝) have separated as a result of the sex photos scandal that has rocked Hong Kong showbiz, Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, reported today, citing rumours.\n\nPatrick Tse (謝賢), father of Nicholas, refused to comment.\n\nReporters for the newspaper telephoned Deborah Li (狄波拉), Nicholas' mother, but could only get through to voicemail.\n\nThe newspaper quoted sources from the legal profession who said that, even though the couple married in the Philippines, the union and any divorce can be dealt with by Hong Kong jurisdiction because at least one of the couple is a Hong Kong citizen. The legal sources told the newspaper that after one year of separation the couple can file for divorce without citing any particular reason.\n\nThe couple married in September 2006. Last year, in an interview with Squat, batgwa.com's supplement pages, Nicholas said his marriage to Cecilia was \"for life\".\n\nCecilia was implicated by the sex photos scandal when images purportedly of her nude and engaged in sex acts with Edison Chen (陳冠希) started surfacing on the internet over two weeks ago. The photos were allegedly stolen from Edison's computer when it went in for repair.\n\nHong Kong newspapers have rumoured for days that Nicholas was angry and upset because some of the sex photos seem to have been taken just before the couple got married.\n\nThe house the couple shared was vacated two weeks ago and the couple have not been seen in public since the sex photos started leaking.\n\ncredits: batgwa.\n\nI don't really like Cecillia Cheung from the start but knowing her having Nicholas Tse's child. I believe she loves him. Guess she was in a stupid action that time but maybe she doesn't dare to tell Nicholas as she afraid of losing him I think. She thought she could escape from that but unfortunately she can't. She should has told Nicholas first, maybe he could understand. What I am pity off, is the innocent little boy.\n\nThose people who create problem to others are really horrible too.\n\nBut knowing that those actors are doing that really shocking too. I really hope they able to talk it out and settle their problem peacefully. Sometimes media really make big mess for artist who tried to have a happy family.\n\nForgive and take and never a second time. Actually everyone does do mistake and stupid but to realize it quickly and not to happen again.\n\nWish them the best and the others.\n\n@ leelee. apparently, while dating nic tse, she slept with edison and took those pictures. and then nic tse married cecilia not knowin that it happened. and if these pictures were taken close to the time that nic tse and cecilia were getting married, then im pretty sure she really was cheating, cuz who goes straight to marriage without dating first? in this case however, i do think that cecilia reall does love nic because she let him impregnate her and have a child. However, i stilldont blame nicholas for being angry about this."
