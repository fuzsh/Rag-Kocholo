        "text": "Cecilia Cheung’s son, Lucas, reportedly dating 46-year-old ski instructor, causing mother’s distress​\n\nBy\n\nDimsumdaily Hong Kong\n\n-\n\n8:28PM Sun April 7, 2024\n\n230\n\nCecelia Cheung (left) and Lucas (right).\n\nListen\n\n7th April 2024 – (Hong Kong) Cecilia Cheung’s 16-year-old son, Lucas, has allegedly entered into a romantic relationship with a 46-year-old ski instructor, leading to his mother’s distress and subsequent hospitalization. Known for her active presence on social media, Cecilia Cheung has mysteriously disappeared from the online platforms for nearly three months. Could it be that the reported relationship has caused her such frustration that she has refrained from using social media altogether?\n\nCecilia Cheung, now 43 years old, was previously married to fellow actor Nicholas Tse, with whom she has two sons, Lucas and Quintus. Following their divorce, in 2018, she secretly gave birth to her youngest son, Marcus, whose biological father remains unknown. Despite the challenges, Cecilia Cheung has been highly praised as a devoted and capable single mother, successfully raising her three children. There were recent rumours suggesting her possible fourth pregnancy, which may have led her to take a break from work.\n\nCecilia Cheung is widely recognized as an exemplary mother within the industry, making the recent news surrounding Lucas all the more shocking. While she has expressed her openness to her son dating, she reportedly struggles to come to terms with the significant age difference of nearly 30 years between Lucas and the alleged ski instructor. This has undoubtedly caused her considerable distress. As news of the relationship surfaced, it ignited a flurry of discussions among netizens, with some drawing comparisons to the romantic preferences of Lucas’s father, Nicholas Tse, who has been in a relationship with singer Faye Wong, who is over 20 years his senior.\n\nHowever, there are also rational voices among netizens who question the credibility of the rumours. They argue that Lucas, being a second-generation celebrity and possessing handsome looks, would have numerous options when it comes to choosing a girlfriend. Moreover, the rumours originated from an unidentified mainland Chinese blogger who failed to provide substantial evidence to support the claims. Without concrete information about the alleged “ski instructor,” it becomes difficult to ascertain the truth. If people readily believe such rumours, it truly becomes a matter of amusement. Such news can only be categorized as laughable.\n\n​"
