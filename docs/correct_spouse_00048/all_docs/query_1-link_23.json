        "text": "Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung. Photo from Cheung's Instagram\n\nLocal media, as cited by Sinchew, have observed Cheung’s absence from the public eye for a month and attributed her hiatus to her pregnancy.\n\nRumors about the actress’ pregnancy gained traction when Cheung was seen donning a loose coat that concealed her lower body, with an intentional avoidance of revealing her stomach in a video that started surfacing on the Internet in November last year. Noticeable changes in Cheung’s facial features were also observed, with her cheeks appearing fuller compared to her previously slimmer face and more defined chin.\n\nThese changes have fueled widespread speculation, especially considering Cheung’s recent surge in activity, while her rise to fame in mainland China following her appearance on the TV show \"Sisters Who Make Waves\" led to a significant increase in job offers.\n\nEfforts by Chinese media to reach Cheung’s manager for comments on the pregnancy rumors last Thursday have so far gone unanswered.\n\nCheung, 44, is celebrated for her performances in films such as \"The Lion Roars,\" \"King of Comedy,\" and \"The Promise.\"\n\nShe entered into marriage with the 44-year-old actor Nicholas Tse in 2006, and the couple welcomed two sons before their separation in 2011.\n\nCheung had her third son in 2018 and has since kept the identity of his father confidential, sparking both media and public conjecture. There were rumors suggesting media tycoon Sun Donghai as the father of Cheung’s son, however, Sun refuted these claims in September last year and warned of legal action against the propagation of such rumors."
