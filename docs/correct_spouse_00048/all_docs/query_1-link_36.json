        "text": "HONG KONG celebrity couple Cecilia Cheung and Nicholas Tse have confirmed that they will be splitting up, ending weeks of speculation on the status of their five-year marriage.\n\nThe actors broke their silence separately. Tse sent out a statement Friday afternoon hinting at a separation or divorce. He said that he had decided to âproceed with family mattersâ after careful consideration.\n\nPart of his statement read: âToday, I will proceed with family matters. I hope it will bring external speculation to an end, so my family can lead a quiet life and my two sons can grow up healthy and happy.â\n\nTse concluded his statement: âFinally, I am deeply thankful for everything Cecilia Cheung has done in these five years and truly wish her well.â\n\nTse also said at a movie promotion event in Beijing yesterday that he still loves Cheung but âproblems have occurred and it is hard to maintain the marriage.â\n\nTseâs statement came hours after the publication of Cheungâs explosive interview with Oriental Daily, in which she accused him of leaking false information to the public to depict a negative image of her as a gold-digger and troublemaker.\n\nShe also blasted him for being a neglectful husband and father, and told him to âstop pretending to be a good man, a good dad.â\n\nCheung, 31 and Tse, 30, secretly married in the Philippines in 2006 and have two sons, Lucas, 3 and Quintas 1.\n\nMuch has been reported about the celebrity coupleâs marital woes for the month since Cheung reconciled with actor Edison Chen. The two were involved in a highly publicized sex photo scandal in 2008.\n\nCheung, who had remained silent during the past month, finally spoke up Friday and revealed details of their relationship.\n\nBesides claiming that Tse was behind a smear campaign to tarnish her image, she also reasoned that Tse was doing so because he did not want to share his fortune with her.\n\nâBut the truth is, I donât need to depend on him. Iâm not poor. Even if I quit entertainment, I would be okay,â said Cheung.\n\nOn Wednesday, her assistant Andy posted on her microblog a statement by a friend of Cheungâs called Yuki Lee.\n\nIn it, Lee said Tse had been largely absent from his childrenâs lives and that he faces his computer all day without saying a word to his wife and sons.\n\nLee also said Cheung bought Tse a car and a watch worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Lee said: âIf she is really so greedy, would she need to spend so much money on that husband of hers?â\n\nCheungâs manager Emily also spoke up and claimed that she was horrified at how the Tse family had âvilifiedâ Cheung, while the actress suffered in silence to keep the family together.\n\n(SD-Agencies)"
