        "text": "Cecilia Cheung, 41, has been appearing on a lot of Chinese variety shows after her stint on Sisters Who Make Waves 2 made her popularity skyrocket in China.\n\nOn Life Is Beautiful, she had to become an assistant at a bridal boutique for a day.\n\nA bride-to-be noticed Cecilia immediately before confessing that she was extremely nervous about her upcoming wedding.\n\nShe then asked Ceci, who was married to Nicholas Tse for five years, whether nerves got the best of her before she walked down the aisle.\n\nInstead of avoiding the topic, Ceci said: “I didn’t have time to get nervous because I got married too quickly.” Her honesty surprised viewers as she almost never talks about her ex after their divorce in 2011.\n\nNic and Ceci tied the knot in September 2006 while vacationing on a private island in the Philippines.\n\nNic shared in previous interviews that Ceci waited only 10 seconds to accept his proposal, and that the wedding happened so soon after that they only “had time to invite about 10 friends .\n\nPhotos: PBE Media"
