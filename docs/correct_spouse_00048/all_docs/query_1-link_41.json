        "text": "If you've been curious about why Cecilia Cheung has been notoriously private about her relationships (assuming there's any), then this might be the answer you've been seeking.\n\nDuring a chat with fellow Hong Kong actress Sheren Tang, the 41-year-old confessed that she's picky when choosing a partner and explained why she's withholding details of her love life.\n\nShe said: \"I'm picky because I want to find someone who really loves me. But even if I do, I still won't disclose any details publicly because when I did so in the past, I didn't feel like I got a lot of blessings [from people].\"\n\nWith a chuckle, Cecilia said the more she shared, the more people found things to criticise and they weren't happy for her.\n\nSheren agreed, pointing out that people tend to make a mountain out of a molehill when such private affairs are shared.\n\n\"So since I opened myself up in the past and shared my joy with people and they created a mess, I wouldn't want to share anything with them again, even if they do find out somehow,\" she said.\n\nCecilia was in a high-profile relationship with actor-chef Nicholas Tse and they even got married in September 2006. The couple has two sons â€” Lucas and Quintus.\n\nHowever, both Cecilia and Nicholas agreed to a divorce in 2011 and the latter is now romantically linked to Hong Kong singer Faye Wong.\n\nAs for Cecilia, she gave birth to a third son in 2018 but has yet to reveal who the father is.\n\nGuess we'll never know at this rate.\n\nbryanlim@asiaone.com"
