        "text": "21 Feb â€“ While Cecilia Cheung has yet to respond to rumours of her romance with 47-year-old film investor Sun Donghai, her manager Yu Yuk Hing stated that the company will give their full blessings if it was indeed true.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao News, previously, it was reported that the actress has been seeing businessman Sun Donghai, and even stayed at his luxurious villa throughout her filming period in Beijing.\n\nSun, who is 12 years older than the actress, is said to be related to her ex-husband Nicholas Tse, and good friend to her former father-in-law, Patrick Tse.\n\nWhen asked to confirm the rumours, AEG's CEO stated that the company has yet to hear from Cecilia about her relationship.\n\n\"However, we think that this is a good thing. We really hope that she will have her own love life,\" said Yu.\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick Tse recently dismissed reports saying that Sun is a family friend, saying, \"Who is he? I don't know this man. He is not a friend. I meet a lot of people every year, I can't remember everyone clearly.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything [about Cecilia and Sun's relationship],\" he said.\n\n(Photo Source: EuropeChinaDaily.com.cn)"
