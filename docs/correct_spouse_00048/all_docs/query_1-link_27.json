        "text": "Credits to Nicholas Fans-tasy for the news.\n\nEastern New Territories - An Interview with Nicholas Tse on Recent Marriage\n\nOctober 3, 2006\n\nOn October 2, Nicholas accepted an interview where he discussed details of his marriage to Cecilia Cheung. Happiness was clearly plastered all over his face, as his smiles couldn't be contained; this, seen throughout the duration of the interview!\n\nReporter: Was it an unplanned wedding?\n\nNicholas: It wasn't. I had asked her before how she had envisioned her wedding ceremony, and she said she hoped for the light of the sun to cast over the seashore; which is why this time there was the light over the seashore. Before going, I had united with her assistant and told her that the hotel there had a dress code, requiring her to bring a dress over. However, we ended up without shoes, resulting in the two of us wearing sandals at the ceremony. It was a good thing her dress was pretty grand; we could still match. I on the other hand, had worn a white shirt with jeans. I had planned it such that the sun would be setting in the background. One side had the setting of the sun, while the other side had thunder and lightning. For the final act, we watched fireworks, while a live band surrounded us with music. Speaking frankly, it was a pretty romantic atmosphere.\n\nI had actually been planning for this wedding, about one and a half to two months prior. This idea was entirely my own; but I was kept very busy. Besides planning this, I had other things to do. But with the aid from my good friends, Cecilia had no idea that I intended to walk with her ‘down the isle.’ I had taken an airplane to Manila, and from there, taken a personal plane to the island. Seeing that the sunset was in place, I suddenly got down on one knee and asked whether she was willing to be my wife. It took her about 10 seconds before she finally gave me an answer. Those 10 seconds were excruciatingly long; I started to fear she would say no. But in the end, she did accept!\n\nFor this trip, I brought a total of three rings over; one for proposing, and two for the wedding ceremony. Cecilia was the one who had packed my luggage for me - In order to keep this discrete, I had tucked the set of wedding rings into the camera bag because I knew that they wouldn't check in the bag. Throughout the entire ceremony, Cecilia was completely dazed; her eyes had absolutely no focus. After the ceremony ended, we witnessed another couple tie the knot. She was still alittle shocked and surprised that it made her and me lose sight of things. Pointing towards their car, she asked me 'How come their car is decorated?' I too had become dazed,and didn't know how to answer her. It wasn’t until after she had looked back at the photos till she realized that our car actually had beendecorated with the biggest decorations, as compared to theirs!\n\nReporter: Was it because you guys were expecting that you married?\n\nNicholas: There really is no baby. We'll let it happen naturally... it doesn't matter how much we have, but yeah, I'm really anticipating for it which is why I won't give up. Although it doesn't matter boy or girl, but what I really hope for is that our first born will be a boy!\n\nReporters: Will Cecilia retire from the entertainment industry?\n\nNicholas: She will! I'm not forcing her to have children, this was actually her own decision. My wife will be like Hilary Tsui, retiring from the industry so she can focus solely on raising our children!\n\nReporter: Do you believe it was Hilary Tsui who leaked on your marriage?\n\nNicholas: Upon returning to Hk, the first phone call I made was to Eason. The second was to Hilary, so it couldn't have been. They had both known before, and had promised not to speak of it! Because Eason had to prepare for his concert, he was unable to attend the ceremony. He had even joked that at his concert, he would say 'Please don't bother my two friends as they watch the show... oh, I forgot to tell you all that they had gone to get married!'\n\nReporters: Is your mother really angry?\n\nNicholas: I know that as her son, I was quite wrong. But it's a small misunderstanding; my mother won't be angry!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nNicholas Tse Finally Ties the Knot.\n\nSeptember 30, 2006\n\nHaving earlier returned to Hong Kong from their vacation, news spread quickly that the two were expecting a baby and thus wed. Arriving back in Hong Kong yesterday morning, Nicholas Tse personally confirmed the secret marriage. He disclosed; “You’re right, I have gotten married! Thank you for everyone’s concern!”\n\nRumour has it Nicholas and Cecilia, with the witness of good friend Eason Chan, secretly married earlier in the Philippines. News also surfaced that Nicholas and Cecilia were expecting a baby, and thus wed. Early the other day, Nicholas appeared at the airport and was immediately surrounded by reporters. Sporting a pair of sunglasses, Nic kept his left hand hidden while tracking through the airport hall, with the aid of his assistant. It was seen that his left hand was kept tightly in his pocket, clearly hiding the engagement band. When Nic finally stopped to answer reporter’s questions, he suddenly pulled out his left hand, which displayed his wedding ring. In all but a matter of 2 seconds, he lifted his left hand, before once again tucking it away.\n\nThe Expecting of a Baby Leads to Marriage\n\nDuring most of the interview, Nicholas chose not to respond. Keeping in good spirits however, Nicholas continued to display his happiness with blissful smiles. When reporters questioned him on the marriage rumour, he selfishly kept his mouth sealed as he smiled. Persistent for answers, the reporters pressed him again, causing Nicholas to finally disclose; “I’ve seen many of the reports, thank you for all your concern. Yes, I have gotten married. As to the other questions, I don’t want to talk too much into it.” Lifting his left hand from his pockets for two seconds, he displayed his wedding ring. As for the reports that the marriage resulted from the couple supposedly expecting, Nic expressed that he will not respond. Questions continued to persist as they questioned whether Cecilia was expecting a boy or a girl, as well as her likely due date. To this, Nicholas simply responds; “I won’t answer, I won’t respond, I will no longer discuss this…” As to whether Deborah Li knows of his marriage, he expressed that she does. Lastly, the reporters made one last request to see the wedding band again. Nicholas rejected with a simple; ‘there’s no reason to.’\n\nPatrick Tse Gleefully Laughs\n\nJust the other day, Cha Siu Yan discussed on a radio program that he had run into Patrick Tse, and congratulated him on becoming an in-law and grandpa. To this, Patrick responded selfishly with joyful laughter. When asked whether he had witnessed the marriage, he pointed out that the week before, he was in Shanghai playing golf. When asked if he had only recently known of the marriage, he stated that this is a family matter. As for Nicholas’s manager, who appeared on the new town entertainment for an interview; to Nicholas’s secret marriage, she expresses that he had told her of his vacation trip, and had a good idea. On whether or not his marriage will have an affect on his career, she expresses that it will not.\n\nthanks to sweetiepie for the translation\n\nhere's the evidence:\n\nhttp://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2006-09-29/15481268613.html\n\noriginal post reposted from AsianFanatics by memomo08"
