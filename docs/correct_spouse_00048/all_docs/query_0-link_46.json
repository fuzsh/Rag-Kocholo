        "text": "In this article, the family name is Tse. In accordance with Hong Kong custom, their Western-style name is Nicholas and their Chinese-style name is Ting-fung.\n\nNicholas Tse Ting-fung (born 29 August 1980) is a Hong Kong actor, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur and TV chef. Tse debuted as a singer in 1996 before shifting his career focus to acting. He is best known for starring in the films Metade Fumaca (1999), New Police Story (2004), Bodyguards and Assassins (2009), The Stool Pigeon (2010), The Viral Factor (2012), As the Light Goes Out (2014), and Raging Fire (2021), as well as the television series The Proud Twins (2005). For his role in The Stool Pigeon, Tse won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor, making him the first person to have won in the three major acting categories, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best New Performer, at the Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\nTse is the founder of Post Production Office, a Hong Kong-based special effects company. The company was acquired by Digital Domain in 2016, with Tse becoming chairman of Digital Domain in Greater China.\n\nEarly life\n\nTse was born at St.Teresa’s Hospital in Ma Tau Wai, Kowloon on 29 August 1980 to Hong Kong actor Patrick Tse (謝賢) and actress Deborah Lee (狄波拉). His younger sister is Jennifer Tse. Tse moved to Vancouver, Canada at eight. He attended St. George's School, Vancouver, where he was friends with Tablo. They were expelled together for fighting with a racist bully. Tse moved back with his family to Hong Kong and attended Hong Kong International School for one year before dropping out due to low grades in grade 10. For a year he lived in Phoenix, Arizona, but was expelled for his academic underperformance. He studied music in Japan before returning to Hong Kong. He held Hong Kong-Canadian dual citizenship until 2021, when he renounced his Canadian citizenship.\n\nCareer\n\nMusic\n\nIn 1996, Tse was noticed by Albert Yeung, the head of Emperor Entertainment Group, when the 16-year-old was singing at a party for a family friend. In 1997, partly to help clear the debts incurred by his father, Tse signed a record deal with the Fitto label, which would become EEG, and released his first album, My Attitude, to runaway success. He won the Most Popular New Artist Award at the 1997 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Tse released two popular albums, \"VIVA\" and \"玉蝴蝶\" (Jade Butterfly). In 2002, Tse received the World's Best Chinese Artist award at the 2002 World Music Award for the latter.\n\nActing\n\nTse's most notable films include Young and Dangerous: The Prequel (1998), Gen-X Cops (1999), New Police Story (2004) and Invisible Target (2007). Tse's performance in Bodyguards and Assassins (2009) earned him an Asian Film Award at the 4th Asian Film Awards for Best Supporting Actor, and in 2011, Tse received a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor at the 30th Hong Kong Film Awards for The Stool Pigeon (2010).\n\nTse dubbed the character Flik in the Hong Kong version of A Bug's Life (1998). He also lent his voice to the Chinese animation film Lotus Lantern (1999).\n\nTse learned martial arts for the screen from Jackie Chan and Chung Chi Li for films such as Gen-X-Cops and Invisible Target. He also worked with Donnie Yen in the martial arts film Dragon Tiger Gate. Tse is a Wing Chun practitioner, trained by fellow actor and friend Philip Ng.\n\nTse has also starred in TV dramas, such as Aiming High (1998), The Monkey King: Quest for the Sutra (2002), and The Proud Twins (2004).\n\nCooking\n\nTse became a TV chef in 2014, when he launched his food travelogue show Chef Nic. In 2015, he opened a cookie bakery in Hong Kong. In 2016, he launched his own lifestyle and food brand Chef Nic (鋒味).\n\nOn 28 October 2016, Tse was honoured as the first \"Friend of Michelin\" for his positive contribution to the gastronomic scene through his work.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, Tse prepared the dessert course for A Night Among the Stars, a seven course gala dinner with Michelin-star chefs Alain Ducasse, Kwong Wai-keung, Tam Kwok-fung, Fabrice Vulin, Hidemichi Seki, and Noah Sandoval.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTse had an on-and-off relationship with singer Faye Wong from 2000 to 2003.\n\nIn September 2006, Tse announced that he had married Cecilia Cheung in Pamalican, Philippines. They have two sons: Lucas (Chinese: 謝振軒), born on 2 August 2007, and Quintus (Chinese: 謝振南), born on 12 May 2010.
