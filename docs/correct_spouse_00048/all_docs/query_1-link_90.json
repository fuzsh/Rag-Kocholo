The actress has the consent of taking those pictures. Then he told to the media that he hope the girls involve can move on to their lives and live happy.\n\nAfter Cecila saw that from TV, she decide to come out and give her 2cents. She explain how hard it was during that incident and the reason why she come out 1 year later (now) to face the media, she had enough with Edision, she said that Edision is being so \"fake\" and pretend wishing the girls have a better and joy life after, he promised to do the best he can to protect the girls, but Cecila claim that he did nothing to protect them, and what he saying to the media few days ago is just to pretend nice. She couldn't accept it and she said he is just a liar even tho he become christian after the incident.\n\nThat pretty much summarize her interview.
