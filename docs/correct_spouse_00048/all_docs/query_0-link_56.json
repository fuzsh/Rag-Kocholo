        "text": "She says \"waited just to love you. Now that I have found you, don't ever go.\" He sings \"that I put down in words. How wonderful life is, while you're in the world.\" Round and round, when love rekindles, legend continues. Romantic trials and tribulations of pop queen Faye Wong and Hong Kong actor Nicolas Tse surprisingly welcome a dramatic reversal. This May-December couple is back together again after they split 11 years ago, reported by China's Sohu news, which, afterward, has been confirmed by their managers. Falling in love, breaking up, being back togetherâ¦ for decades, every movement of these two lovers has never failed to hit the headlines. Now, let's have a look at this nearly two-decade-long zigzag romance.\n\nOn March 12, 2000, Faye Wong and Nicolas Tse were snapped by Hong Kong media kissing in a pub. A week later they were snapped dating with each other. In June 2000, after attending a party, Wong and Tse left a bar in Hong Kong hand in hand in full view of reporters; their romance was officially exposed.\n\nTheir first break-up was in 2002, when Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung came between them. And Hong Kong media had photographed Tse and Cheung traveling to Thailand together.\n\nIn 2003, they were photographed hand in hand in Beijing. But soon in the same year, they broke up again.\n\nIn November 2005, Wong married Chinese actor Li Yapeng and gave birth to Li Yan a year later.\n\nNicolas Tse married Cecilia Cheung in 2006 and had two sons, Lucas and Quintus.\n\nNicolas Tse ended his five year marriage with Cecilia Cheung in August 2011. Cheung is now in Singapore with their two sons.\n\nIn September 2013, Faye Wong divorced her husband, Mainland actor Li Yapeng and ended their nine year relationship.\n\nAccording to a report by Oriental Daily News, Vicki Zhao, a Mainland actress who is also Faye Wong's good friend, helped the two reconnect. While acting in Nicolas Tse' food show, Zhao told him that he has \"a lock on someone's heart,\" hinting that Wong had never gotten over him.\n\nOn August 8, 2014, Wong's birthday, Tse uploaded a video, in which he played guitar and sang let us be together forever. Netizens think Tse showed his love to Wong by the video.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, Paparazzi took a video of Tse and Wong kissing in her apartment. According to a report on Sohu website, the two stayed at home for four days and were seen acting lovey-dovey. Soon, their managers confirmed their reunion.\n\nIn the song, Tse sings, \"Let us be together forever. Let us be together forever. From the heaven to the hell, I will always be with you. Though we all know it is tough, for love, we do. I will always hold you.\"\n\nã1ãã2ãã3ãã4ãã5ãã6ãã7ãã8ãã9ãã10ãã11ãã12ã"
