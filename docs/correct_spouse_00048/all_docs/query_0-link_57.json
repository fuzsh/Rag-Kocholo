        "text": "Many were excited to hear that Nicholas Tse and Faye Wong were appearing at the 2021 CCTV Mid-Autumn Festival Concert especially since the power couple rarely make public appearances together. Things didn’t quite work out since the two never even shared the same frame that night. Nicholas sat in the audience while Faye sang on stage.\n\nNonetheless, the love story of Nicholas Tse and Faye Wong is one that has unfolded in the public eye over the past two decades. Rumors of their romance first broke in early 2000 and lasted two years. Dating rumors with actress Cecilia Cheung broke in early 2002. Faye Wong tied the knot with actor Li Yapeng in July 2005. Nicholas Tse and Cecilia Cheung get hitched at the luxurious Amanpulo Resort in the Philippines in September 2006. The two subsequently divorced n 2011. They have two sons, Lucas and Quintus. Meanwhile, Faye Wong got divorced in 2013. Faye has two daughters – her oldest, Leah Dou, from her first marriage to singer Dou Wei, and her youngest, Li Yan, from her marriage to Li Yapeng.\n\nNicholas Tse and Faye Wong eventually rekindled their romance in 2014. Despite breakup rumors, occasional sightings of the two have put such rumors to rest. In a recent interview where Nicholas was asked if he’s thought about when he wants to get married, he responded, “I’m not getting married.” Nowadays, Nicholas, 41, and Faye, 52, seem contented to keep a low profile and many are happy for them."
