        "text": "In this article, the family name is Cheung. In accordance with Hong Kong custom, their Western-style name is Cecilia and their Chinese-style name is Pak-chi.\n\nCecilia Cheung Pak-chi (Chinese: 張栢芝; born 24 May 1980) is a Hong Kong actress and cantopop singer. Cheung is considered a \"Sing girl\"—an actress who first received media attention through starring alongside Stephen Chow, and later went on to her own successful career.\n\nBiography\n\nCheung was born in 24 May 1980 at Man Wah Sun Chuen, Jordan, Hong Kong to Davies Shally, who is of half Chinese and half British descent, and Cheung Yan-yung. Her parents divorced when she was nine years old. She was sent to Melbourne to live with her aunt at the age of fourteen and then attended Camberwell Girls Grammar School. She has an elder half-sister, two younger brothers, and a younger half-brother from her father's side.\n\nCareer\n\nHer career began in 1998, when she was cast in a television commercial advertising lemon tea. She caught the attention of Stephen Chow after shooting the ad. Later, Cheung made her film debut as a young nightclub hostess in Stephen Chow's King of Comedy (1999). King of Comedy became the highest grossing local film of the year, and shot Cheung to fame in Hong Kong. She then starred in Fly Me to Polaris (1999), which earned her the award for Best Newcomer at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Cheung also sung the theme song for Fly Me to Polaris, which gained attention among the masses for her singing ability. In the same year, Cheung launched her singing career with her first Cantopop album Any Weather (1999).\n\nCheung made inroads into the Korean market with Failan (2001) co-starring Choi Min-shik. The film earned her a nomination at the Grand Bell Awards for Best Actress. She then starred in the Chinese comedy film The Lion Roars (2002). Cheung impressed the audiences with her portrayal of the independent and spunky heroine, and won the Most Popular Actress award at the Chinese Film Media Awards.\n\nCheung reunited with Derek Yee in the crime thriller One Nite in Mongkok (2004). She was nominated for the Best Actress award at the Hong Kong Film Awards for the third time.\n\nCheung was cast in her first television project, where she played the legendary singer Zhou Xuan in The Wandering Songstress (2008). She was reportedly paid 200,000 yuan per episode to film the drama.\n\nCheung's next few films failed to achieve commercial success and were critically panned.\n\nCheung has earned 70 million HKD in 2014, ranking number nine in the top ten list of Hong Kong's highest (entertainment) celebrity incomes in 2014.\n\nIn early 2021, Cheung joined the second season of Chinese reality series Sisters Who Make Waves, a singing and dancing competition among 30 women with established entertainment careers.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCheung married fellow Hong Kong entertainer Nicholas Tse in a secret wedding ceremony in the Philippines in September 2006. She gave birth to their first son in August 2007 and their second son in May 2010.\n\nOn 23 August 2011, the couple made a public announcement of an agreement to a divorce. They agreed to hold joint custody of their two sons.\n\nCheung announced in a Weibo post from her studio that she had given birth to a third son on 18 November 2018.\n\nIn March 2020, Cheung voiced her support for Xinjiang cotton after several international companies announced that they will no longer purchase cotton from the region due to concerns over Uyghur human rights.\n\nIn June 2021, Cheung revealed on the Chinese variety show Life Is Beautiful 2 to fellow actress and friend Sheren Tang that if she were to enter a new relationship, she would not make it public. On the same show, Cheung revealed she had moved to Shanghai for several months and plans to reside in the city long term due to more work opportunities and to send her children to better schools.\n\nSelected filmography\n\nFilm Year English title Original title Role Notes 1999 King of Comedy 喜劇之王 Lau Piu-piu Fly Me to Polaris 星願 Autumn Yue The Legend of Speed 烈火戰車2極速傳說 Nancy 2000 Tokyo Raiders 東京攻略 Saori Twelve Nights 十二夜 Jeannie Help!!! 辣手回春 Dr. Ho Wing-yan 2001 Wu Yen 鍾無艷 Enchantress / Yin Chun Master Q 2001 老夫子2001 Mandy Everyday is Valentine 情迷大話王 Wonderful Failan 파이란 Failan Shaolin Soccer 少林足球 Dragon Player No. 7 Cameo Para Para Sakura 芭啦芭啦櫻之花 Yuriko Sakurada / Yuriko's granny The Legend of Zu 蜀山傳 Dawn / Enigma 2002 Second Time Around 無限復活 Tina Chow Mighty Baby 絕世好B Boey The Lion Roars 我家有一隻河東獅 Moth Liu 2003 Love Under the Sun 愛在陽光下 Short film Cat and Mouse 老鼠愛上貓 Bai Yutang Honesty 絕種好男人 Didi Wong Running on Karma 大隻佬 Inspector Lee Fung-yee Lost in Time 忘不了 Holly Lam 2004 Fantasia 鬼馬狂想曲 Harmy Bobo Papa Loves You 這個阿爸真爆炸 Customer refused entry to café Cameo One Nite in Mongkok 旺角黑夜 Dan Dan The White Dragon 小白龍情海翻波 Black Phoenix / White Dragon Jr. 2005 Himalaya Singh 喜馬拉亞星 Peacock The Promise 無極 Qing Cheng 2006 The Shopaholics 最愛女人購物狂 Fong Fong-fong My Kung-Fu Sweetheart 野蠻秘笈 Phoenix The 601st Phone Call 第601個電話 Tian You 2011 All's Well, Ends Well 2011 最強囍事 Claire Treasure Hunt 無價之寶 Peggy Jiang Legendary Amazons 楊門女將之軍令如山 Mu Guiying Speed Angels 極速天使 You Mei The Lion Roars 2 河東獅吼2 Wang Yueying 2017 Out of Control 失控·幽靈飛車 Lucy Lin TBA 11th Day and One Night 十一天零一夜\n\nTelevision Year English title Alternative title Role Notes 2008 The Wandering Songstress 天涯歌女 Zhou Xuan 2018 Love Won't Wait 如果，爱 Wan Jialing\n\nDiscography\n\nYear English Title Chinese Title 1999 No Matter How The Weather...Cloudy, Rainy Or Sunny (EP) 任何天氣 Destination 2000 A Brand New Me 不一樣的我 Cecilia Cheung Mandarin Album 張柏芝同名國語專輯 2001 Cecilia Cheung New & Best Collection 張柏芝全新經驗新曲+精選 Party All the Time (Remix Album) Brand New Image 最新形象 2002 Real Me 真我 2003 Colour of Lip (New + Best Collection) 至愛唇色(新曲+精選) 2005 C1\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Award Category Nominated work Results Ref. 2000 19th Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actress Fly Me to Polaris Nominated Best New Performer Won King of Comedy Nominated 2002 39th Grand Bell Awards Best Actress Failan Nominated 2003 3rd Chinese Film Media Awards Most Popular Actress (Hong Kong/Taiwan) The Lion Roars Won 2004 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actress Lost in Time Won Running on Karma Nominated 10th Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award Best Actress Won 4th Chinese Film Media Awards Best Actress (Hong Kong/Taiwan) Nominated Lost in Time Won Most Popular Actress (Hong Kong/Taiwan) Nominated 9th Golden Bauhinia Award Best Actress Won 2005 24th Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actress One Nite in Mongkok Nominated 5th Chinese Film Media Awards Best Actress (Hong Kong/Taiwan) Nominated 2012 1st LeTV Entertainment Awards Most Popular Film Actress (Asia Pacific) N/A Won Most Commercially Valuable Actress N/A Won\n\nSee also"
