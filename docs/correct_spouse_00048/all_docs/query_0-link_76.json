        "text": "Nicholas Tse Ting Fung and Cecilia Cheung Pak Chi's marriage has become a hot topic recently. The media split into two and went to Malaysia and Shenzhen to cover Ting Fung and Pak Chi at work. Pak Chi was rumored to bring their sons to see Ting Fung in Malaysia after her film wrapped. However, yesterday online news claimed that according to Ting Fung's famous musician friend, they were already back together and in contact everyday. They absolutely were not headed for divorce.\n\nYesterday to Sina, a certain famous musician and Tse Ting Fung's good friend revealed that Ting Fung and Pak Chi had a minor scuffle over Pak Chi and Edison Chen Koon Hei's photo on the plane, but actually they already made up and stayed in contact everyday. Divorce rumors were making something out of nothing. As for Pak Chi supposedly withdrawing over 100 million cash from their joint account and suggesting separation, the musician said that the news was false. However he knew Ting Fung was very upset over Pak Chi and Chen Koon Hei's photo, though he has always loved Pak Chi. In the end he still forgave his wife.\n\nEarlier Cha Siu Yan revealed on the radio that Pak Chi was taking Ting Fung to the cleaners. Some said that Ting Fung's mother Deborah Li was the puppet master behind the scene. The musician said that Lai Goo was very upset at the photo incident and blamed Pak Chi, but Lai Goo has forgiven Pak Chi as well. At first Lai Goo indeed complained to Cha Siu Yan, who of course did not let the opportunity to break the news on the radio go. After that, Lai Goo blamed Cha Siu Yan, who now chooses to handle the matter in a low profile. The musician pointed out that he spoke up mainly due to the current media's nonstop speculation. The details that he discussed have been confirmed with people around them.\n\nYesterday Ting Fung continued to work on THE VIRAL FACTOR. First the team blocked off the streets in preparation for a drug store scene. Ting Fung and Jay Chou (Chow Kit Lun) began work around 1PM. Both had injury make up.\n\nDuring the shoot, Chairman Chou in a gree coat first went to the drug store with bandage on his neck and blood stain on his left arm. Later he left the drug store and entered a white vehicle with a lot of medical supply. Chairman Chou also ran into two police officers on patrol.\n\nYesterday Chairman Chou and Ting Fung did not have any scene together. After Chairman Chou completed his shoot, director Dante Lam Chiu Yin worked on Ting Fung's scene. Ting Fung was luckier than Chairman Chou. In the heat he did not have to wear a coat. Only in a black tank top he worked with a tattooed left arm. Ting Fung often studied the script with the team next to the drug store while he waited for his shoot. He appeared to be in decent mood. With almost 200 pedestrians looking on, female fans went to the nearby restaurant to sit and watch Ting Fung and Chairman Chou's shoot. Someone curiously screamed, \"Would Cheung Pak Chi come?\" Perhaps due to the distance Ting Fung could not hear.\n\nSources: takungpao, mingpao, singtao, on.cc\n\nTranslated by: hktopten\n\nSo basically most everything until now was all a bunch of crap from the media? Smh. Also, I wonder if the \"musician\" is Vanness Wu bc he was just in HK and was pictured with Philip Ng on the latter's blog, and they're both friends with Nic soooo...."
