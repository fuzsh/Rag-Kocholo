        "text": "We really don’t know what the future holds for us.\n\nIn April, Nicholas Tse proclaimed to the world in an interview that he loved his wife the most, more than his sons. Later that month, he went up the stage at the Hong Kong Film Awards and told her “you look beautiful tonight.”\n\nIn May, Cecilia Cheung was reported to have met Edison Chen on a flight from Taipei to Hong Kong, and that the ex-lovers who were involved in a photo scandal back in 2008, even sat next to each other.\n\nThus began the downward spiral of the Tse-Cheung romance. I wouldn’t say it was a fairy tale because it was fraught with drama from the love triangle with Faye Wong to the bitter break-up and the reconciliation in 2006 that eventually led to marriage. The union has resulted in two sons: Lucas and Quintus. But after five years of marriage, they are now officially divorced.\n\nAn old Coke commercial of Nic and Cecilia:\n\nThey have released a statement on the divorce, saying their separation was due to personality differences. They are sharing custody of their sons but no mention of division of properties although it took 16 hours of negotiations for them to reach an agreement.\n\nThis statement ends three months of speculation and circus that followed their story from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur to Bejing.\n\nIt is dated August 19 and read as follows:\n\nJoint Statement\n\nWe Cecilia Cheung and Nicholas Tse announce our joint decision to divorce because of personality clashes. We have reached an agreement regarding the divorce.\n\nWe express our heartfelt gratitude to the public and our families for their concern. We are sharing custody of our two children and hope to provide them a peaceful environment so they could grow up happy.\n\nAfter this statement, we will not make any response on divorce matters.\n\nCecilia Cheung, Nicholas Tse August 19, 2011\n\n(Rough translation)\n\nIs it really the end for Nic & Ceci? No one really knows.\n\nEnd note: Five years of marriage, two sons, 16 hours negotiations, 70 words to announce divorce."
