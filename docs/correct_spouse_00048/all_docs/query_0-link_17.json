        "text": "Hong Kong media recently reported that Cecilia Cheung allegedly receives HK$80mil (RM47mil) per year as spousal support from ex-husband Nicholas Tse. That works out to about RM3.9mil a month.\n\nTse and Cheung were married for six years from 2006 to 2012 and they have two sons together – Lucas and Quintus. Cheung has a third child Marcus but has kept the identity of his father a secret\n\nWith that amount of money, you would think that Cheung would take it easy and lead a leisurely life. But not this 42-year-old.\n\nAfter appearing in the recent variety show, Sisters Who Make Waves 2, Cheung's popularity in China soared. And she's using this opportunity to make even more money.\n\nIn Cheung's first live stream sale recently, she managed to sell 100mil yuan (RM65mil) of products in one session, making her the first female celebrity to achieve such numbers in 2022 in China.\n\nNetizens calculated that Cheung would've earned 20mil yuan (RM13mil) in commission from her live stream. That's a tidy sum for a few hours' worth of work.\n\nFifteen-year-old Lucas said in an interview that his mother works hard so that he and his brothers will be well taken care of in the future.\n\n“Mum saves up all the money that Dad gives us. She hopes to leave the alimony untouched for us to use when we grow up,” Lucas said."
