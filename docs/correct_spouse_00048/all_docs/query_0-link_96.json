        "text": "First time opening her heart in speaking about the artistes sex scandal, Cecilia Cheung besides denouncing Edison Chen, she also choked on her words describing her mentality in the past year. She felt very uncomfortable, thought that she would become crazy, but she has always been \"calm\" and refused to admit that she was a victim, so she decided to just face the matter with courage. But the media has been chasing after her, causing her to feel that she's dragging her family into this. Also friends who saw the pictures, when they came to send their Chinese New Year greetings, they would pretend that nothing happened, this made her feel even more hard to accept. Fortunately her husband Nicholas Tse and family members has been giving their full support and concern towards her. She felt this she has ran through her life's most difficult time.\n\n\"On the day when the news came out, I had to shoot ads, my company and the advertisement agency all thought I wouldn't go, but I still went to do it. It was really hard to bear! I knew that the Media would write a lot about me, but people need to be responsible! I know that I am wrong too.\" Cecilia frankly said that the Media was very forceful when trying to interview her, making it hard for her to breathe. There was one time she carried her son Lucas back to Hong Kong from Thailand, she knew that there will be a bunch of reporters waiting for her at the airport, she felt that her family were affected: \"When I got home, I cried miserably...... I was afraid that I would affect the Tse Family!\"\n\nBecause the sex photos were released on Lunar New Year, she said in red teary eyes: \"When friends came for New Year greetings, my heart felt very uncomfortable, I saw my friends in front of me pretending that nothing had happened, it was even more harder to bear!\" But, friends didn't say anything, and another group of friends would feel pleased. Family's support made me very touched.\" She continued: \"When I walked out on the streets the first day, My father-in-law (Patrick Tse) came to my home, he did not say anything at all, he only pretended to look after Lucas, he wanted to give me the message that if there is a problem, the whole entire family will support! Like my mother-in-law (Deborah), she only gave me a doll, it is two dolls holding onto lotus leaves, engraving the 4 words 'Wind & Rain Same Road'\".\n\n\"My Wife is fine, She has me here\"\n\nAs for her husband Nicholas Tse, Cecilia depends on him for a new strength for rebound: \"My husband didn't ask me anything, he only said one thing: 'Wife, no problem, I am here!'\"\n\nCecilia's parents also gave her their full support, her mom told her: \"If mom could bear this, I would bear for you.\" She said thankfully: \"There's one night that it was very difficult for me to hold it in, with my daughter \"going so bad\", Mom can only show her concern, giving her more courage, facing her mistakes.\" Speaking of family support, she has cried over the sex scandal 2 or 3 times, already cried into a Tearing Person.\"\n\nSource: Oriential Daily\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://******************/forums/"
