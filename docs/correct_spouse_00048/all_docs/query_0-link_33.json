        "text": "A video of Nicholas Tse’s chat with top Chinese streamer Wei Ya is going viral for what netizens think is an indirect jab at his ex-wife, Cecilia Cheung.\n\nDuring the live broadcast, Wei Ya mentioned that as a Virgo, she feels the need to have things done in a certain order. To this, Nic replied, “Me too. The details are important as well, that’s why cheating makes me…” This sudden declaration stumped Wei Ya as she tried to salvage the situation by jokingly asking her husband, who was off-camera, if he heard what Nic had said.\n\nThis brief exchange has been making the rounds on Weibo, as many wondered why Nic would suddenly bring up the topic of extramarital affairs during a conversation. Many assume that this has something to do with Cecilia, and dug out Nic’s old interviews to look for more clues.\n\nIn one of them, he shared that he “doesn’t like my other half to wear clothes that are too revealing because I’m a very traditional man”. Netizens then shared that Ceci wears sexy outfits more often than Faye Wong, whom Nic is currently dating. However, none of his past interviews mentioned cheating, which got netizens even more intrigued.\n\nOne said, “The [sex tapes] with Edison Chen happened before Nicholas and Cecilia got married, so I don’t think his statement is about that. Now I’m really curious to know if Ceci cheated on him while they were together.”\n\nAnother pointed out, “He could have been referring to Faye as well. Everyone knows that he, Cecilia and Faye were in a love triangle before he and Cecilia got married. Did he end up marrying Cecilia ‘cos Faye cheated on him? But if that’s so, why is he dating Faye now?”\n\nThe conspiracy theories got even more intense when a netizen wrote, “Could this be his way of announcing that he and Faye are over ‘cos she cheated on him?\n\nWith no clarification from Nic at press time, it looks like this mystery won’t be solved any time soon.\n\nPhotos: PBE Media"
