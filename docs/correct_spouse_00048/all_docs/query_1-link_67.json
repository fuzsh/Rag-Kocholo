        "text": "Wow. Vanness Wu and Cecilia Cheung in a drama? This is about as left field a pairing I can think of but I like both actors individually, and they are up as an enstranged marriage couple in Chinese drama, Love Can’t Wait. Judging by the trailer, it is going to be an emotional and psychological train wreck from start to finish.\n\nIn short, a married couple’s life fall apart after the death of their child. I think they get divorced (not too sure with the divorce papers flying on and off the table in several scenes) and wifey moves on with another man. Hubby refuses to give up, and finds out that ex-wifey’s new man was actually the one who caused his son’s death. But Hubby is struck with a terminal disease and only ex-wifey’s new man, who is a doctor, can save him through surgery…he just needs to get those trembling hands to work again. Someone call Heo Im!!!\n\nHubby’s life is temporarily extended while wifey is torn between her past and current love. I think my favourite part of the trailer is when she finds out new man is helping ex-hubby to hide the truth about his illness, and she goes, “You two bastards. I don’t ever want to see you both ever again.” You go, girlfriend!\n\nAmid all this crazy melodrama is really about Cecilia’s character overcoming her personal pain, loss and challenges, and discovering her true self and finding her feet again in life.\n\nI could totally watch this for Vanness Wu and Cecilia Cheung, and I think I will try. I think both of them would be able to portray their role realistically and with the maturity required to make the narrative work. I haven’t watched a modern Mandarin drama for the longest time and I kinda miss that.\n\nvideo credit as stated"
