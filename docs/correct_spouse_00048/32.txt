Hong Kong actor Nicholas Tse has two sons from his marriage with Cecilia Cheung. They married in 2006 at a secret wedding ceremony in The Philippines.

The couple ultimately divorced in 2011, and gained joint custody of their two sons.

Tse eventually got back together with his ex-girlfriend Faye Wong, while Cheung went on to have another son.

So everything seemed settled more or less, with the two appearing to have firmly gone their own way.

However some remarks reportedly attributed to Tse has sparked some fresh controversy.

According to Sin Chew Daily, Tse reportedly remarked that he had secretly been in love with Wong for 20 years.

Now this kinda puts the entire marriage with Cheung in quite an awkward spot.

And one person in particular definitely did not take well to Tse's remarks.

Tse's son Lucas had some choice words for his biological father.

According to Yahoo, he told media that he did not regret his mother leaving Tse, claiming Tse did not deserve her.

He then went on to say that he and his brother rarely sees his father, and it was always their mother, Cheung, who took care of them when they fell ill.
